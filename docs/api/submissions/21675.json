I'm a former teacher.  When students didn't turn in an assignment, we were expected to give them 50 points.  No work done got them 50 points because \"a zero would crush their spirit.\"  Meanwhile, I had students who really struggled (due to language issues, etc.) and tried and earned a 50 righteously.  I curved their grade a bit based on effort since they at least tried.  \n\nI once had a student who didn't do a single assignment all 6 weeks.  I'd had enough and entered zeroes in the gradebook.  Principal called and told me I needed to replace his zeroes with 50s and it should take about 5 minutes.  I told her it would take longer than that because I was going to have to go back and add 50 points to every grade for every other student in his class in the interest of fairness.  She told me to forget it.  I'm sure she changed his grades, but I didn't.\n\nI think the attitude of everyone wins for participating is part of why employers are struggling now.  We've taught people that just showing up is enough.  My employer actually expects me to work for my paycheck.  No work leads to no job leads to employer having to hire someone new and retrain them.  It's a mess.\n\nYou're right.  Kids need to learn that just showing up isn't enough.  You and I learned that as kids and while it may have hurt momentarily, it made us more successful in the long run.", "At age three it's fine to just reward people for playing. I also think that teaching kids how to lose gracefully, not just in sports but social occasions, when playing games, etc, is more a parents responsibility than a coaches or teachers. At age twelve? Yeah, that's more of an issue, but at such a young age just let them have fun without making it a competition.\n\nDo I think it makes you an AH for mentioning it? No, but I do think it's a bit... off? Shortsighted? Misguided maybe? Some kids at that age are still struggling with the concept of potty training, learning to lose gracefully is way above their paygrade and you should be able to recognise that. The assistant coach was right, that stuff comes as they get older.", "YTA. Those kids are just 3 and you already want them to compete against each other?", "Yta- but softly. You said your kid was 3, that\u2019s a baby! Also not the coaches job to teach your kid to be a loser that\u2019s up to the parents. Things change as they get older and sports become competitive. Friendly matches are for fun and if you are constantly feeling bad or last you may give up the sport forever. Just let the kids have fun and you can teach them how to lose", "YTA. It was rude to complain like that especially after they made such a wonderful day for the children", "NTA.  I\u2019ve been involved in youth sports for over twenty years and this is always a hot topic.   We have discussed doing away with the participation trophies many times but we\u2019re always torn.   For some of these kids, this may be the only time they ever when a trophy of any kind, which has always been a big reason on keeping them.  The other thing is that the little kids especially just loooove them.   So we\u2019ve always been torn.  At some point we removed them from the older age groups and just did tshirts or something as a gift but those parents lost their ever loving minds :).  Once my kids reached a certain age they didn\u2019t give a flip about trophies unless it was for first place.", "YTA- they\u2019re three, they probably barely even know what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s no losers because the goal is just to get them outside and on a field. \n\nGive it like three years and then put her in competitive sports and she\u2019ll learn how to lose for sure (or win, who knows)", "NTA. My mom and dad hated stuff like this too. I joined soccer at some church that was during the summer when I was younger. They (the coaches) never kept score but my parents did. I think learning how to lose at a young age is vital to how they will be when they are older and understand scores and sports more", "NTA At that age ,\"almost 3\", are the medals even for the kids? Why give out any sort of award for a 2 yr old's soccer practice. It's ludicrous. More likely they're for the parents.  You were correct and your husband seems more concerned about what other people think, than in casual conversation.", "leaning NTA but I would recommend stepping back and letting her enjoy the game. If you wish to share those thoughts with your daughter do that in private, not around other parents and children. There is a reason they do not keep score in any sport for children under 5. It's not about winning and losing, it's all about fundamentals and having fun. If they are not having fun, they will never want anything to do with any sport when they are older. There are a million leagues for every sport now as she gets older it will become all about winning. Losing feels like shit, there is no reason to make a 3 year old go thru that, risk turning them off from the game so a couple parents can feel good their 3 y/o won.  Additionaly why risk creating drama at your child's game? It dose not take much to upset people these days, another parent might not take kindly if you are blurting your views around their children (it could be something else down the line). You would feel like crap if you created a scene at your child's sports game.", "At 3 they shouldn\u2019t even be getting trophies, just having fun and learning the sport.

Appreciate your thoughts, and wholeheartedly agree that  as she grows up and understands more - I would like her to understand that when you actually go out into the real world that no one is going to give you a participation medal if she happens to not win. \nAnd also, that losing is absolutely fine too - losing at something doesn't make you a loser. Kids just need to learn how to pick themselves up, dust it off, and try again! \nThat was what I had replied to my spouse saying - I am ok with having diffrrent opinions that him, as long as I am not rude or hurting anyone - if I had to redo that situation, maybe be a little mindful of who is around me while voicing my brutal opinion.

Soccer, basketball. T-ball kept score at like...after kindergarten age.  \"Back in the day\" it was a ribbon, and not a medal...but same concept.

And even if this is a divisive topic, it should be perfectly acceptable to talk about it out loud. I certainly wouldn't try to bring a 3 year old into the conversation or make them feel bad about themselves, but adults can and should talk about topics such as these on occasion, as long as the conversation is adult and polite.\n\nThat said, I don't think doing this for 3 year olds is going to overly affect their ability to understand the merit based society that they will eventually join, as long as it doesn't continue indefinitely. At some point kids need to be introduced to the fact that all human beings are unique individuals with unique skills and traits, and that's a good thing.

I'd say soft YTA for bringing up something that may be controversial, in that setting, for no reason.", "Honestly, participation trophies are for parents I swear. I once went to a competition where the parents gave EVERYONE a medal as to not hurt anyone's feelings. It was absolutely infuriating. Kids were mad because some girls for 3 or 4 medals because.. you know they won, some people were disgusted they had to get on podiums for simply showing up to an event.

Literally, every single kid got a medal because we base the categories on tests and skills rather than age and they didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. So, regardless if you couldn't skate, land a jump, and broke all the rules for a program you still got a medal on a podium for pictures with your family in your heat. Then when it came time for medal placings there were.. many tantrums. Some kids didn't understand why some girls had 3 or 4 medals and they only had one, some girls got ribbons (4th place) and were made to take pictures with the girls at the podium and that was embarrssing. It was a mess. It was a rather insulting competition actually, we were all pretty upset. \n\n\nI can understand an age based sport like toddlers soccer but I do get the distaste for participation trophies/medals, as a kid who got them. Just, don't let kids hear you that's a crap thing to do to a kid whose just excited to be there. \n\nI still think YTA.", "[deleted]", "I would say not doing the work is equivalent to not showing up/not participating and that your example doesn\u2019t match in context multiple ways: age/developmental, the zero sum nature (no kids have to \u201close\u201d in school whereas one team will lose the game, so losing a game should not be viewed similarly to failing school), and purpose/setting. Plus doing work = participation.", "At that age, sports should be used in a way to improve coordination, socialising and building self-confidence.", "Found the guy who\u2019s never been to a soccer game between 2 teams of two-year-olds. At that age it\u2019s a victory if none of them need a diaper change during the game.", "But that\u2019s not the point at 3 yrs old.  It\u2019s about teaching to enjoy playing sports.  You gain competitiveness as you continue to play not by being told you must win.  Sure I hate participation trophies every year. Mainly because there a waste of money but we all got paper certificates at one time growing up.  There\u2019s this idea that if your not playing to win than what\u2019s the point but it\u2019s more important to play the game than to just win at a young age.  Sports for youths have become stressful for all involved.   Full time training at 8yrs old is crazy.  90% or more will not play past high school if even then.  Just teaching them to be active outside the house should be the goal.", "But you never played sports.  How do you know this is the proper attitude?  I hate to say you heard from someone else.

To the point many opt out or don't try over a fear of failing. We are talking as young as grade 1/2s all the way through grade 8. I often say we need to work at framing failures and supporting a child through failure asap.", "I remember when I didn't know all kids get a trophy for participating which the parents pay for.

Few years later my kids are in T-ball with no scoring and as it was nearing the end of the season coach sends a flyer out about how much trophies are and to give him the money. I told my sister that the parents basically are buying trophies and they don't earn them. That's when she fessed up and let me in on the secret that everyone gets a trophy. \n\nYears later I look back and don't think it was a bad thing because as they get older there will be kids that always excel and get a trophy and then they are the kids that will never experience getting a trophy. My nephew is one of the kids that would have never received a trophy but he did get experience getting a trophy and his mother being proud that he had gotten one. \n\nA few years ago my sister started walking in 5K races so she could get the participation metal with the ribbons around her neck.

Nothing wrong with holding your child to a higher standard and teaching them to do the same.", "I think this is a great learning moment here. Rewarding people for showing up by giving them a little badge of honor for it helps encourage people do things they want to do but may be too afraid to try. I think its a similar sentiment to having snacks or little gifts just by being there and having fun. I think its more about morale than who won or lost the game. Its nice to celebrate together. Things where its actually important whether you win or lose, like competitive sports, id say have a better reason not to do things like participation medals. But even competitive places can be hostly to the participants for just showing up. Like snacks, drinks, merch, etc. NAH. \n\n\nRemember: Always strive to be understanding and considerate with children. When they learn, they teach us things, too.

I still have the stupid things stuffed into a box in the attic one in a while I will see em and remeber playing but its always coupled with that disapointment.", "YTA ... but not really intentionally. \n\nThis has been the culture for many years now. I don't like it either, because it no longer stops when children are toddlers. we don't let kids fail anymore because we are more concerned about protecting their feelings than we are about teaching them to live with not always being the best at everything. watching the first few waves of kids raised by helicopter parents show up in the workplace has been horrifying. I have no doubt their parents meant well and thought they were doing the right thing. but they weren't.\n\nThe expectation of everyone getting a trophy and everyone being sooooo amazing just for showing up continues into adulthood and causes serious problems, including major entitlement issues. Whereas previously kids would learn gradually through exposure to failure that it's a normal part of life and there can be a lot of value in it and that it helps make a person resilient, we see now that a lot of teenagers and young adults are experiencing failure or rejection for the first time extremely late in life, and they have no idea how to handle it. As a parent this terrifies me. I didn't raise my kid to be that way, but he's definitely an exception among his peers.\n\nThe point of sports for extremely young kids is just to get some exposure to a sport and see if they even like it. But imo, the longer we engineer kids' lives to ensure children avoid discomfort -- failure and embarrassment and disappointment -- the more we're robbing them of any ability to become successful and resilient adults who aren't crushed by the vagaries of everyday life.", "YTA\n\nThey are literally 3", "Yta.  Participation trophies are a tangible reward for putting in effort.   As they get older those usually go away.

There are no winners or losers in this situation. \n\nWhile being critical of participation ribbons/trophies can have its place this is not one of those places.

At 3 years old it's more important to cultivate a love for the game/being active/being part of a team than it is to set clear winners and losers.", "I don't believe in participation trophies.", "YTA\n\nI played softball in the 80s. Every team got some kind of trophy at the end of the season. Some were participation trophies that were rather small. But the winning team of the season got the BIGGEST trophies. We tried hard to get those big trophies, but had to make do with small ones. We didn't stop trying to win, but we were proud and happy to have gotten SOMETHING. We had something that, decades later, we could look at and remember friendships and amazingly klutzy mistakes. (Like the time I ran over the catcher because I was so excited to get homebase the first time.)\n\nParticipation trophies and ribbons don't take away from winners. They don't discourage kids from trying to win. They just give kids something to remember later, so they can smile fondly on memories.", "If the kids were older I'd say N T A, but they're 3 ffs! That's an appropriate age to give everyone participation trophies. While kids do need to learn how to lose gracefully, complaining about *literal toddlers* getting participation trophies is ridiculous. So yeah, YTA. Your kid is 3 not 13.", "YTA.   You can't have a meaningful winner and loser unless the rules are strictly enforced, otherwise the team who cheats the most wins.  Strictly enforcing the rules on a bunch of 2 year olds who are just learning how to kick a ball is going to make the game boring and frustrating for the kids.  \n\nThese kids have plenty of time to learn about winning and losing.  At 2 they are winning if they manage to kick the ball without falling over.", "And then it's those same parents who'll turn around and mock the next generation when they try to make changes or complain about something that's legitimately not fair with 'not everyone gets a trophy'.", "Also once they are not three, they know! I am of the \u201cparticipation trophy\u201d generation and they know. \n\nI did find some ribbons years later and smiled at the memories, though.", "It was a negative and unnecessary statement. I hope your kid didn\u2019t hear it. These sorts of awards/prizes, especially at that age, are not about making everyone feel better for losing but to reward kid\u2019s hard work. Hopefully, you can alter your attitude about it and teach your kid that hard work, practice, team work, etc. are valuable whether you win or not. Your original statement contradicts your comment.", "I dunno why youre getting so many downvotes. This is very much a moment in which growth can occur. All these people being negative are perpetuating the negativity that they think youre omitting. You asked a genuine question and i think the best takeaway is to grow to become more understanding. Its a light ordeal. Lets overcome it :) its totally okay to celebrate your child whether they win or lose. If they have a problem with losing, thats where you teach them how to manage their emotions. But never let that get in the way of celebrating them putting themselves out there. I hope this helps.", "Frankly, I'm not sure I understand your mentality. In one breath you're complaining about participation trophies but in another you said you would have appreciated getting one when you were a kid. So which is it? You think participation trophies are pointless and detrimental and kids shouldn't get them or they can be a nice little pick me up that would be noce for kids to have?\n\nI also hope you realize that no one actually thinks a participation trophy is in any way shape or form comparable to an actual trophy you win. Little bitty kids might not fully understand, but when your kid is older, she definitely will. I played a few sports when I was younger and whenever our team got participation trophies, we didn't care at all. We knew it didn't mean we won. It's not like we were tricked into thinking we won. We knew it was literally just a prize for actually playing at all. It's a reward for the effort you put in, not a reward for that effort making you the best.", "yeah i understand now.", "Correct. At preschool levels they are learning to show up, participate, and how to do the most basic elements of the game. That's their job. It isn't about winning or losing. They aren't even learning positions other than goalie and not the goalie. They just crowd around the ball, play in the dirt, run to their parents on the sidelines, pick flowers, chase butterflies, and sometimes just stand there doing nothing. You might have 1 kid that is super focused and understands what they are doing, the rest are (hopefully) just happy to be there.", "Some of them literally do not understand the concept of winning or losing. That\u2019s too advanced for them.", "yeah i know i\u2019ve already backed down. since i\u2019ve never really watched or gone to a really young kids football tournament so i guess my logic could be applied to an older group of kids.", "No worries. I have coached  for many years at the youth level until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I hate any trophies at that age, more because they are a waste of money for the parents who pay for them.  I have seen a lot of kids who were superstar 8yr olds that don\u2019t even play sports a few years later. Conversely, kids who couldn\u2019t do anything at that age become great in There later teens.  I have dealt with many parents who thought they new what there kid needed.   In the US at least youth sports is an industry that a lot of adults make a living off of.  I love sports but hate the politics.  I have let my kids find there own way with support and honest communication.   My first two chose to put in the effort to continue at the college level.  I encourage playing for fun but it becomes really fun when your good.  They are very competitive to the point it\u2019s hard to play a board game without arguments.  \nBut I do smile brightly at the parents who thought there 8yrs old was destined for the superbowl (I hope you get that reference) and there kids want nothing to do with sports now.  Cheers.", "yeah i get your reference. it\u2019s nice to end a dispute on a good note. good job coaching all those kids, i salute all the adults that have the patience. i hope you have a good day brother"]}
