I'm a former teacher.  When students didn't turn in an assignment, we were expected to give them 50 points.  No work done got them 50 points because \"a zero would crush their spirit.\"  Meanwhile, I had students who really struggled (due to language issues, etc.) and tried and earned a 50 righteously.  I curved their grade a bit based on effort since they at least tried.  \n\nI once had a student who didn't do a single assignment all 6 weeks.  I'd had enough and entered zeroes in the gradebook.  Principal called and told me I needed to replace his zeroes with 50s and it should take about 5 minutes.  I told her it would take longer than that because I was going to have to go back and add 50 points to every grade for every other student in his class in the interest of fairness.  She told me to forget it.  I'm sure she changed his grades, but I didn't.\n\nI think the attitude of everyone wins for participating is part of why employers are struggling now.  We've taught people that just showing up is enough.  My employer actually expects me to work for my paycheck.  No work leads to no job leads to employer having to hire someone new and retrain them.  It's a mess.\n\nYou're right.  Kids need to learn that just showing up isn't enough.  You and I learned that as kids and while it may have hurt momentarily, it made us more successful in the long run.", "At age three it's fine to just reward people for playing. I also think that teaching kids how to lose gracefully, not just in sports but social occasions, when playing games, etc, is more a parents responsibility than a coaches or teachers. At age twelve? Yeah, that's more of an issue, but at such a young age just let them have fun without making it a competition.\n\nDo I think it makes you an AH for mentioning it? No, but I do think it's a bit... off? Shortsighted? Misguided maybe? Some kids at that age are still struggling with the concept of potty training, learning to lose gracefully is way above their paygrade and you should be able to recognise that. The assistant coach was right, that stuff comes as they get older.", "YTA. Those kids are just 3 and you already want them to compete against each other?", "Yta- but softly. You said your kid was 3, that\u2019s a baby! Also not the coaches job to teach your kid to be a loser that\u2019s up to the parents. Things change as they get older and sports become competitive. Friendly matches are for fun and if you are constantly feeling bad or last you may give up the sport forever. Just let the kids have fun and you can teach them how to lose", "YTA. It was rude to complain like that especially after they made such a wonderful day for the children", "NTA.  I\u2019ve been involved in youth sports for over twenty years and this is always a hot topic.   We have discussed doing away with the participation trophies many times but we\u2019re always torn.   For some of these kids, this may be the only time they ever when a trophy of any kind, which has always been a big reason on keeping them.  The other thing is that the little kids especially just loooove them.   So we\u2019ve always been torn.  At some point we removed them from the older age groups and just did tshirts or something as a gift but those parents lost their ever loving minds :).  Once my kids reached a certain age they didn\u2019t give a flip about trophies unless it was for first place.", "YTA- they\u2019re three, they probably barely even know what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s no losers because the goal is just to get them outside and on a field. \n\nGive it like three years and then put her in competitive sports and she\u2019ll learn how to lose for sure (or win, who knows)", "NTA. My mom and dad hated stuff like this too. I joined soccer at some church that was during the summer when I was younger. They (the coaches) never kept score but my parents did. I think learning how to lose at a young age is vital to how they will be when they are older and understand scores and sports more", "NTA At that age ,\"almost 3\", are the medals even for the kids? Why give out any sort of award for a 2 yr old's soccer practice. It's ludicrous. More likely they're for the parents.  You were correct and your husband seems more concerned about what other people think, than in casual conversation.", "leaning NTA but I would recommend stepping back and letting her enjoy the game. If you wish to share those thoughts with your daughter do that in private, not around other parents and children. There is a reason they do not keep score in any sport for children under 5. It's not about winning and losing, it's all about fundamentals and having fun. If they are not having fun, they will never want anything to do with any sport when they are older. There are a million leagues for every sport now as she gets older it will become all about winning. Losing feels like shit, there is no reason to make a 3 year old go thru that, risk turning them off from the game so a couple parents can feel good their 3 y/o won.  Additionaly why risk creating drama at your child's game? It dose not take much to upset people these days, another parent might not take kindly if you are blurting your views around their children (it could be something else down the line). You would feel like crap if you created a scene at your child's sports game.", "At 3 they shouldn\u2019t even be getting trophies, just having fun and learning the sport. Participation trophy mentality has destroyed our young adults as most now have no coping skills. They don\u2019t know how to deal with rejection from schools, jobs, relationships, etc. kids need to learn life isn\u2019t equal and you don\u2019t get rewarded just for showing up and that Hard work does pay off", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. You just spoke the truth. The world is filled with victors and losers. The sooner kids learn this harsh reality, the better prepared they'll be for the future. Just remember that as a parent, it's your job to guide them through both victories and defeats. It's one thing to encourage kids and give them a taste of success, but it's another to shield them from loss entirely. The real world doesn't hand out participation medals, so why should we?  \nAs for the concern about being rude, you're entitled to your opinions and have the right to express them. That doesn't mean you're right or wrong, but you should never feel bad for stating your beliefs, especially when they're grounded in your concern for your child's future. The fact that you're thinking about this shows that you're a thoughtful parent who wants the best for your child. Don't let societal norms and niceties suppress your own instinctual feelings about raising your child.", "YTA", "And weve all got that family member you simply cant play a fun friendly game with because they are so competative have to win. Suck the joy out of it with being anal about rules and double checking everyones moves and then flipping the board or throwing the cards and storming off because its fixed as they not winning!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not wrong but the coach and your spouse are also correct that it\u2019s not the time for it. 3 year old soccer games are not actually games. They\u2019re for kids learning to kick the ball around and go towards the goal. If someone scores, it\u2019s because they happened to kick in hard enough and no one is in goal. It\u2019s not that no one wins or loses because everyone gets an award. No one wins or loses because they\u2019re not actually playing a game. At 3, the things that are going to teach a kid to lose gracefully are the things that will teach a kid they don\u2019t always get what they want in general.", "YTA You can argue any trophy is bad because kids should be playing for joy or passion\n\nparticipation trophies aren\u2019t for the kids. They\u2019re for the parents who would have a shit fit if their kid wasn\u2019t an all-star", "Eloquently put! I will be mindful moving forward, so that kids don't hear me and feel discouraged. That I will do for sure! Thank you for your thoughts :) This is a good life lesson to have and will try my hardest to ingrain this spirit in my daughter - without ever discouraging her. I believe in earning it with hard work vs. having everything handed to you, for sure.", "And a real adult shows up!!\nAgreed with all of this, and NTA!", "Appreciate your judgment :) I didn't think I was complaining since I am still happy she got the medal and genuinely thanked all the involved coaches, assistant coaches, and staff there. I was stating a concern that was on my mind - but yes, it could be perceived as complaining. I see that.", "Thank you! Appreciate your thoughts, and wholeheartedly agree that  as she grows up and understands more - I would like her to understand that when you actually go out into the real world that no one is going to give you a participation medal if she happens to not win. \nAnd also, that losing is absolutely fine too - losing at something doesn't make you a loser. Kids just need to learn how to pick themselves up, dust it off, and try again! \nThat was what I had replied to my spouse saying - I am ok with having diffrrent opinions that him, as long as I am not rude or hurting anyone - if I had to redo that situation, maybe be a little mindful of who is around me while voicing my brutal opinion. I really did appreciate the effort from all the staff and coaches!"]}
