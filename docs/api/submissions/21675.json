I'm a former teacher.  When students didn't turn in an assignment, we were expected to give them 50 points.  No work done got them 50 points because \"a zero would crush their spirit.\"  Meanwhile, I had students who really struggled (due to language issues, etc.) and tried and earned a 50 righteously.  I curved their grade a bit based on effort since they at least tried.  \n\nI once had a student who didn't do a single assignment all 6 weeks.  I'd had enough and entered zeroes in the gradebook.  Principal called and told me I needed to replace his zeroes with 50s and it should take about 5 minutes.  I told her it would take longer than that because I was going to have to go back and add 50 points to every grade for every other student in his class in the interest of fairness.  She told me to forget it.  I'm sure she changed his grades, but I didn't.\n\nI think the attitude of everyone wins for participating is part of why employers are struggling now.  We've taught people that just showing up is enough.  My employer actually expects me to work for my paycheck.  No work leads to no job leads to employer having to hire someone new and retrain them.  It's a mess.\n\nYou're right.  Kids need to learn that just showing up isn't enough.  You and I learned that as kids and while it may have hurt momentarily, it made us more successful in the long run.", "At age three it's fine to just reward people for playing. I also think that teaching kids how to lose gracefully, not just in sports but social occasions, when playing games, etc, is more a parents responsibility than a coaches or teachers. At age twelve? Yeah, that's more of an issue, but at such a young age just let them have fun without making it a competition.\n\nDo I think it makes you an AH for mentioning it? No, but I do think it's a bit... off? Shortsighted? Misguided maybe? Some kids at that age are still struggling with the concept of potty training, learning to lose gracefully is way above their paygrade and you should be able to recognise that. The assistant coach was right, that stuff comes as they get older.", "YTA. Those kids are just 3 and you already want them to compete against each other?", "Yta- but softly. You said your kid was 3, that\u2019s a baby! Also not the coaches job to teach your kid to be a loser that\u2019s up to the parents. Things change as they get older and sports become competitive. Friendly matches are for fun and if you are constantly feeling bad or last you may give up the sport forever. Just let the kids have fun and you can teach them how to lose", "YTA. It was rude to complain like that especially after they made such a wonderful day for the children", "NTA.  I\u2019ve been involved in youth sports for over twenty years and this is always a hot topic.   We have discussed doing away with the participation trophies many times but we\u2019re always torn.   For some of these kids, this may be the only time they ever when a trophy of any kind, which has always been a big reason on keeping them.  The other thing is that the little kids especially just loooove them.   So we\u2019ve always been torn.  At some point we removed them from the older age groups and just did tshirts or something as a gift but those parents lost their ever loving minds :).  Once my kids reached a certain age they didn\u2019t give a flip about trophies unless it was for first place.", "YTA- they\u2019re three, they probably barely even know what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s no losers because the goal is just to get them outside and on a field. \n\nGive it like three years and then put her in competitive sports and she\u2019ll learn how to lose for sure (or win, who knows)", "NTA. My mom and dad hated stuff like this too. I joined soccer at some church that was during the summer when I was younger. They (the coaches) never kept score but my parents did. I think learning how to lose at a young age is vital to how they will be when they are older and understand scores and sports more", "NTA At that age ,\"almost 3\", are the medals even for the kids? Why give out any sort of award for a 2 yr old's soccer practice. It's ludicrous. More likely they're for the parents.  You were correct and your husband seems more concerned about what other people think, than in casual conversation.", "leaning NTA but I would recommend stepping back and letting her enjoy the game. If you wish to share those thoughts with your daughter do that in private, not around other parents and children. There is a reason they do not keep score in any sport for children under 5. It's not about winning and losing, it's all about fundamentals and having fun. If they are not having fun, they will never want anything to do with any sport when they are older. There are a million leagues for every sport now as she gets older it will become all about winning. Losing feels like shit, there is no reason to make a 3 year old go thru that, risk turning them off from the game so a couple parents can feel good their 3 y/o won.  Additionaly why risk creating drama at your child's game? It dose not take much to upset people these days, another parent might not take kindly if you are blurting your views around their children (it could be something else down the line). You would feel like crap if you created a scene at your child's sports game.", "At 3 they shouldn\u2019t even be getting trophies, just having fun and learning the sport. Participation trophy mentality has destroyed our young adults as most now have no coping skills. They don\u2019t know how to deal with rejection from schools, jobs, relationships, etc. kids need to learn life isn\u2019t equal and you don\u2019t get rewarded just for showing up and that Hard work does pay off", "[deleted]", "YTA", "And weve all got that family member you simply cant play a fun friendly game with because they are so competative have to win.

You\u2019re not wrong but the coach and your spouse are also correct that it\u2019s not the time for it. 3 year old soccer games are not actually games. They\u2019re for kids learning to kick the ball around and go towards the goal. If someone scores, it\u2019s because they happened to kick in hard enough and no one is in goal. It\u2019s not that no one wins or loses because everyone gets an award. No one wins or loses because they\u2019re not actually playing a game. At 3, the things that are going to teach a kid to lose gracefully are the things that will teach a kid they don\u2019t always get what they want in general.", "YTA You can argue any trophy is bad because kids should be playing for joy or passion\n\nparticipation trophies aren\u2019t for the kids.

That I will do for sure! Thank you for your thoughts :) This is a good life lesson to have and will try my hardest to ingrain this spirit in my daughter - without ever discouraging her. I believe in earning it with hard work vs. having everything handed to you, for sure.", "And a real adult shows up!!\nAgreed with all of this, and NTA!", "Appreciate your judgment :) I didn't think I was complaining since I am still happy she got the medal and genuinely thanked all the involved coaches, assistant coaches, and staff there. I was stating a concern that was on my mind - but yes, it could be perceived as complaining. I see that.", "Thank you! Appreciate your thoughts, and wholeheartedly agree that  as she grows up and understands more - I would like her to understand that when you actually go out into the real world that no one is going to give you a participation medal if she happens to not win. \nAnd also, that losing is absolutely fine too - losing at something doesn't make you a loser. Kids just need to learn how to pick themselves up, dust it off, and try again! \nThat was what I had replied to my spouse saying - I am ok with having diffrrent opinions that him, as long as I am not rude or hurting anyone - if I had to redo that situation, maybe be a little mindful of who is around me while voicing my brutal opinion. I really did appreciate the effort from all the staff and coaches!", "They\u2019re three years old. Give them all the awards", "YTA - They\u2019re freaking 3 year old kids.

Soccer, basketball. T-ball kept score at like...after kindergarten age.  \"Back in the day\" it was a ribbon, and not a medal...but same concept. They were considered practice matches, or scrimmages...not actual games to keeps score on how the Purple Team is kicking Green team's ass.\n\nYour comment was more suited to a cranky conservative trying to win points on social media.  If you didn't intend your comment to be passive-aggressive negative commentary or some political statement about overly coddled kids,  please be aware now that it comes off like that.", "Ah so you're parroting boomers.

You just described what is wrong with society.", "NTA. However, there is an organization called Team NEGU that will take donated participation medals and send them with some surprises to kids (and possibly their siblings) with things like cancer. It was a nice surprise for my daughter and she feels proud when she sees it because to her it equates to her being brave.", "NTA - I'm more in the 'you want it--earn it' crowd.   Not everyone can be a winner and everyone needs to learn that.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't sound like it was rude at all, from the way you've described it. And even if this is a divisive topic, it should be perfectly acceptable to talk about it out loud. I certainly wouldn't try to bring a 3 year old into the conversation or make them feel bad about themselves, but adults can and should talk about topics such as these on occasion, as long as the conversation is adult and polite.\n\nThat said, I don't think doing this for 3 year olds is going to overly affect their ability to understand the merit based society that they will eventually join, as long as it doesn't continue indefinitely. At some point kids need to be introduced to the fact that all human beings are unique individuals with unique skills and traits, and that's a good thing. But that can probably wait until they're a little older!", "I agree with you 100% but I don't think it needed to be brought up because it doesn't sound like it was being discussed at all. I'd say soft YTA for bringing up something that may be controversial, in that setting, for no reason.", "Honestly, participation trophies are for parents I swear. I once went to a competition where the parents gave EVERYONE a medal as to not hurt anyone's feelings. It was absolutely infuriating. Kids were mad because some girls for 3 or 4 medals because.. you know they won, some people were disgusted they had to get on podiums for simply showing up to an event. The skaters were furious, the only people happy were a few bleeding heart parents and young kids (until others got medals they didn't get).\n\n\nIt was worse than the competition I knocked myself out at.", "When I was figure skating at this one competition everyone got a medal. Literally, every single kid got a medal because we base the categories on tests and skills rather than age and they didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. So, regardless if you couldn't skate, land a jump, and broke all the rules for a program you still got a medal on a podium for pictures with your family in your heat. Then when it came time for medal placings there were.. many tantrums. Some kids didn't understand why some girls had 3 or 4 medals and they only had one, some girls got ribbons (4th place) and were made to take pictures with the girls at the podium and that was embarrssing. It was a mess. It was a rather insulting competition actually, we were all pretty upset. \n\n\nI can understand an age based sport like toddlers soccer but I do get the distaste for participation trophies/medals, as a kid who got them. Just, don't let kids hear you that's a crap thing to do to a kid whose just excited to be there. \n\nI still think YTA.", "that\u2019s what a football match is. competing. they\u2019re not old enough to understand competitiveness just yet but it could help them perform better if they understand what they could be awarded if they win. if everyone gets the same prize, even a kid who didn\u2019t play at all and just sat there, then you\u2019re not just teaching them that losing is just as good as winning, you\u2019re teaching them to be lazy. OBVIOUSLY not in a general sense (although it could be), only in a sporting sense, but still.", "I would say not doing the work is equivalent to not showing up/not participating and that your example doesn\u2019t match in context multiple ways: age/developmental, the zero sum nature (no kids have to \u201close\u201d in school whereas one team will lose the game, so losing a game should not be viewed similarly to failing school), and purpose/setting. Plus doing work = participation.", "At that age, sports should be used in a way to improve coordination, socialising and building self-confidence.", "Found the guy who\u2019s never been to a soccer game between 2 teams of two-year-olds. At that age it\u2019s a victory if none of them need a diaper change during the game.", "But that\u2019s not the point at 3 yrs old.  It\u2019s about teaching to enjoy playing sports.  You gain competitiveness as you continue to play not by being told you must win.  Sure I hate participation trophies every year. Mainly because there a waste of money but we all got paper certificates at one time growing up.  There\u2019s this idea that if your not playing to win than what\u2019s the point but it\u2019s more important to play the game than to just win at a young age.  Sports for youths have become stressful for all involved.   Full time training at 8yrs old is crazy.  90% or more will not play past high school if even then.  Just teaching them to be active outside the house should be the goal.", "But you never played sports.  How do you know this is the proper attitude?  I hate to say you heard from someone else.  Sports should be as much about winning as just participating.  Life long active to be healthy.  If she continues then she will learn about loosing.  And a good parent will explain it when needed.  At 3 they don\u2019t care.", "But you were rude her, muttering under your breath. The kids aren't even 3. That's a lesson they can wait to learn. YTA still. But it's not the end of the world.

Two year olds are frequently not fully verbal and not potty trained. They are about as smart as dogs.  They\u2019re not done baking yet.", "There 3!!  Who cares who wins or looses.

It\u2019ll normally be slightly older kids. so forgive me if my reasoning maybe applies to an older set of kids. but i still think the losing kids shouldn\u2019t be rewarded just as much as the winning kids.", "yeah sure but at least have a subtle difference between the prizes for the losers and the prizes for the winners. subtle encouragement for subtle changes in attitude. before the kids start having proper ways to express emotions and make up their minds i think they should have small suggestions for what they could do/believe in life and something that they\u2019re playing/attending often could do just that. good performance=better rewards. i\u2019m not saying a drill sergeant has to mock the shit out of the kids if they fail. i\u2019m just saying they don\u2019t have to be rewarded.", "and you say they\u2019re just 3 as if i\u2019m talking about all 3 year olds as a whole. im just talking about HALF of those three year olds at that tournament. the other half are left feeling probably underwhelmed at the prizes they received after they won.", "Most people don\u2019t understand that for every tiger woods there are thousands of kids that hate sports and there parents.  Sports are meant to be fun.  Competition comes later.", "I\u2019m sure they all could care less until some adult that never made there middle school team starts tell them they should.  And there are many of those involved in youth sports.", "Idk what years middle school is in i england but I made my primary school team and i played for a good amount in the early months of my secondary. i\u2019m still in secondary now. I just don\u2019t play it as much but i still play it with my old friends. listen friend this isn\u2019t an attack on you and if it makes you feel better, i\u2019ll delete my reply. I still think it\u2019ll save the tournament organisers money if they don\u2019t give out those trophies every time and those kids probably won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between a winners trophy and a losers trophy so they won\u2019t associate winning with good and losing with bad. BUT i understand i guess i\u2019m putting an unfair amount of pressure on a little toddlers shoulders to perform well. my bad. have a good day brother."]}
