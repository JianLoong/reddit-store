My main instrument is the cello. I have a very important recital coming up in December, so over thanksgiving break, I took my cello home with me. \n\nI live relatively far from family, so it\u2019s much easier for me to fly than to drive. Whenever I fly with my instrument, I always buy a second seat on the plane so that I don\u2019t have to check my cello. I absolutely cannot check it because 1) I don\u2019t have a flight case and 2) even if I did have a flight case, most airlines don\u2019t know how to properly store instruments during flight. I refuse to take that risk, because if my cello were destroyed, my degree would be as well. \n\nThe day before thanksgiving, I got to my gate with my cello and all was well. I scanned both boarding passes and made my way to my seats. I bought a window and middle seat for my cello and I. Soon after I was in my seat, a rather\u2026large woman put her carry-ons above me and tried sitting in the aisle seat. However, it soon became clear that she wouldn\u2019t fit in just one seat. She couldn\u2019t sit with the armrests down, and even then she was spilling over into the aisle, almost touching the person across the aisle.\n\nShe looked at me and asked if I could please check my cello under the plane so she could use both seats. I told her absolutely not, that it would be irreparably damaged if I checked it. She started crying and pleading with me to move it somewhere else, but I wouldn\u2019t budge. Eventually a flight attendant came over and asked me to move my cello, until I showed her my two boarding passes. The woman ended up having to leave the plane as there was no other room anywhere else for her. \n\nI felt really bad for her and got dirty looks from the flight attendant and other passengers throughout the flight. The topic came up over thanksgiving when my grandfather asked me how my flight was. Half my family said I was in the right, because it was my seat and that lady should have thought ahead, but the other half (including my grandfather) said people always take priority over \u201ctoys.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m feeling very conflicted.

How is that not clear to people? How is it even a question? The other passenger's problem is HER problem to fix, not yours.", "NTA. Simple!  You bought a seat for it so it\u2019s paid.

This lady basically asked you to give her a seat for free that you paid for. You needed two seats and therefore you planned ahead and paid for two.

Her situation is unfortunate and I feel for her, but if she required special accomodations for the flight then she needed to make them before boarding, instead of simply showing up and relying on everyone around her to accomodate her in the moment. After all, that's exactly what you did.\n\nNo, the only reason I didn't vote \"no assholes\" is because your grandfather is a pretty ignorant one, specifically for referring to your cello as a \"toy\".

She knew her size and she knew it was potentially a problem. When you fly, you should always expect that the flight is fully booked. She was banking on being able to take up more than her allotted space. So were you, which is why you bought your cello its own seat. Because you thought ahead! \n\nMy dad is a very big guy, too. We either buy an extra seat or make sure he's seated next to me, so he can \"spill\" over into my seat and not be a bother to other people.

I swear these airline seats only fit 8 year olds these days but like you did planning ahead for needing 2 seats, the other lady could have done the same.

I have to travel regularly for work, and am not a particularly slender person (I'm by no means so large that I would block the aisle as OP suggested, but the seat belts are usually an inch or so too short). In the roughly two years I've been asking for an additional seat at check-in, I was rebooked onto a different flight once.
