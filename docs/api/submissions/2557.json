He married a Scottish-born Australian and they have two boys ages 8 & 10.\n\nI will be going to Australia for work. I got the job with no help. I told him the good news and told him I\u2019m looking for help finding an apartment. I haven't been to Australia so I don't know what his house looks like and its size. I've seen his photos on FB but I've only seen their living room and kitchen. It turns out that his house has 4 bedrooms. The 2nd bedroom which is the 2nd largest room is for my nephews. The 3rd bedroom is what they use as an office/games room. The 4th bedroom, which is smaller than the 3rd bedroom, is being used as a storage room. I asked my brother how big it is and he said I can comfortably fit a queen bed.\u00a0\n\nHe offered me the 4th bedroom. It's also an advantage because his house is a 5-minute walk from a train station, ride the train for 5 stops and then walk for 10 mins from the station to my office. 20-25 minutes tops of commute. He said that he'll be more than happy to furnish the bedroom with the basics (bedframe, mattress, desk and chair) and I can buy the rest. There is a built-in wardrobe which is more than big enough for me.\u00a0\n\nMy brother is a nurse and my SIL is a dentist. I know it can be difficult to keep a house clean and orderly while they work full-time and take care of two kids. So I told him that I'll be more than happy to help with the chores, cook occasionally, maybe look after the kids after school and pay rent and utilities. With this, I'm actually expecting my share to be exactly one-third of what they pay. I didn't tell him this but he said that he and SIL will be talking about it & will get back to me.\n\nA week later, he sent me their detailed monthly spent. From what I understand, I'm basically gonna be paying more than their share. He said that for housing alone costs them almost $5000 a month and I am expected to pay around $2000 monthly. This also includes the chores I offered.\u00a0\n\nI told him that it isn't fair for me to pay more than them and still be expected to do most of the chores. My job offer is decent but I plan to save money so I can find my own apartment. His reasoning was I'm single, they have kids. I can afford to pay for anything I want. With my financial help, it will give them a relief money-wise before I move out.\u00a0\n\nI gave them a compromise that if they expect me to pay $2000, I won't be helping out in the house but more than willing to help with my nephews. He refused and said that he's doing me a favor by making it easy for me once I start my new job. I don't have to do look for an apartment and possibly get a crappy one. I also think he's compensating for the furniture he offered me for my room and the convenience of their house being near from my workplace.\n\nThe sad part is, my mom feels okay with the offer and thinks I'm crazy for missing the great opportunity.

I am not sure if the expectation of paying 1/3 of their monthly costs is the correct way to do the math,  if they own the home they have put in a substantial down payment, plus are on the hook for any repairs and improvements, so it's not as simple as splitting the costs between the three adults living there. \n\nYou should consider the potential harm to your relationship with your brother if you move in with him.
