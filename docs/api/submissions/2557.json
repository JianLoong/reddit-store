He married a Scottish-born Australian and they have two boys ages 8 & 10.\n\nI will be going to Australia for work. I got the job with no help. I told him the good news and told him I\u2019m looking for help finding an apartment. I haven't been to Australia so I don't know what his house looks like and its size. I've seen his photos on FB but I've only seen their living room and kitchen. It turns out that his house has 4 bedrooms. The 2nd bedroom which is the 2nd largest room is for my nephews. The 3rd bedroom is what they use as an office/games room. The 4th bedroom, which is smaller than the 3rd bedroom, is being used as a storage room. I asked my brother how big it is and he said I can comfortably fit a queen bed.\u00a0\n\nHe offered me the 4th bedroom. It's also an advantage because his house is a 5-minute walk from a train station, ride the train for 5 stops and then walk for 10 mins from the station to my office. 20-25 minutes tops of commute. He said that he'll be more than happy to furnish the bedroom with the basics (bedframe, mattress, desk and chair) and I can buy the rest. There is a built-in wardrobe which is more than big enough for me.\u00a0\n\nMy brother is a nurse and my SIL is a dentist. I know it can be difficult to keep a house clean and orderly while they work full-time and take care of two kids. So I told him that I'll be more than happy to help with the chores, cook occasionally, maybe look after the kids after school and pay rent and utilities. With this, I'm actually expecting my share to be exactly one-third of what they pay. I didn't tell him this but he said that he and SIL will be talking about it & will get back to me.\n\nA week later, he sent me their detailed monthly spent. From what I understand, I'm basically gonna be paying more than their share. He said that for housing alone costs them almost $5000 a month and I am expected to pay around $2000 monthly. This also includes the chores I offered.\u00a0\n\nI told him that it isn't fair for me to pay more than them and still be expected to do most of the chores. My job offer is decent but I plan to save money so I can find my own apartment. His reasoning was I'm single, they have kids. I can afford to pay for anything I want. With my financial help, it will give them a relief money-wise before I move out.\u00a0\n\nI gave them a compromise that if they expect me to pay $2000, I won't be helping out in the house but more than willing to help with my nephews. He refused and said that he's doing me a favor by making it easy for me once I start my new job. I don't have to do look for an apartment and possibly get a crappy one. I also think he's compensating for the furniture he offered me for my room and the convenience of their house being near from my workplace.\n\nThe sad part is, my mom feels okay with the offer and thinks I'm crazy for missing the great opportunity.

Chores and child cards are not a tenants job and if you\u2019re renting from them you\u2019re a tenant. They are in fact trying to use you and gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re in the wrong. If you go through with this they will only pile on more and more expectations. And honestly you should only be paying a 1/4 or 1/5 of the place because you\u2019re taking up 1 room of 4 and you\u2019re one of 5 house occupants so at the least utilities should be 1/5 you and rent/mortgage should be split 1/4 you. They\u2019re screwing you over big time.", "NTA - holy crap, they are trying to take you for a ride.", "NTA. Just politely tell him you have decided to make other arrangements.", "NAH. You don\u2019t have to agree to his offer. He doesn\u2019t have to offer you a lower rate than he wants to be giving up space in his family home. \n\nIdk what the going rate for apartments there is, but if you can find something for less than $2k/mo, I would personally just get my own place.", "NTA- I live in the expensive heart of Colorado and pay $950 for my basement bedroom. (It\u2019s the entire basement w/ bathroom. Utilities included) They want you to pad their pockets while YOURE the one that\u2019s moving to a different country? I think you\u2019re the one who could use some pocket change. \nAlso this feels like an abuse of family relationship- would they expect anyone else to pay more than their fair share? Just because you don\u2019t have children doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have expenses, and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean you just have all this free money. It may be more stress up front, but I think you\u2019d be better off finding an apartment elsewhere. If your bro thinks he\u2019s \u201cdoing you a solid\u201d by making you pay his bills, what other \u201ckind\u201d things is he going to expect?", "NTA but neither is he.  It's his house and he's providing most of the furniture that you'll need.  They don't have to let you stay there. How much are apartments in that area?  Will you be saving by staying with him?  Could you negotiate down a little if that helps?  Maybe $1800? You will be doing them a huge favor with the kids and chores plus financially.  I would hope they would be willing to negotiate.  Remind him that they may have kids but they have two incomes, you have only one. Good luck.", "NTA. Honestly, they're taking you for a ride. You can rent a luxury furnished 1 bedroom apartment for $2000 per month in many places. Maybe a studio in Sydney...\n\nDefinitely too much for a room while also working around the house.", "NTA He's taking advantage of you. I lived in Brisbane for a couple of years not too long ago. I paid less than $1000 per month to rent a room in a 2 bedroom apartment with my own bathroom, all utilities included. I know things are more expensive now, but there's no way that $2000 for rent AND being responsible for housework and childcare is a fair deal.", "If you start out like this you need to realize it will only get worse. If you feel you're being taken advantage of at this point, you will resent them once you start adding child care and household duties to their rent demand.", "He has full right to change you anything he wants to live in his home. You have full right to refuse his offer.", "Check with your new employer and see if they have an Employee Assistance Program that could help you find somewhere to live near work.", "NTA go find a shared house . Plus side you will meet new people down side you share spaces. But you would do this at your brothers plus probably feel like you need to stay in your room. \n\nHe said why he wanted to charge you so much he is using you to build up his savings.   Still offer to be there for the kids when you are free win win", "nta! and don't let people take advantage of you.", "INFO: Do you get your own bayhroom?? And what about that office/games room? Are you able to use that? \n\nI believe you should pay for what you're getting, ad then of course factor in that you're helping more around the house, with kids, etc. So this is important info.\n\nEdit: does this also include utilities?", "Do. Not. Do. It.  You already know how this will go - you'll feel resentful that you're subsidizing them so greatly and are still their maid.  Find a studio, find a roommate, anything, and establish a relationship outside of landlord/tenant with your brother and his family.  You will all be better off.", "This isn't fair. You shouldn't be railroaded for not having children. Their taking advantage of you. Tell em you're gonna get your own place and see if they come crawling back with a more reasonable offer.", "Yea $2000 a month is ridiculously high for a room. You'd be better off living with students tbh. I understand it's expensive all around but you might as well have you're own apartment at that rate (some ppl allow family to live with them for free)\n\nPlus his family activities are going to take precedence over your hobbies and freedoms. He's taking full advantage of your opportunity to railroad you into a total jip if you ask me.", "It\u2019s expensive here but not that expensive! If we\u2019re talking $2000 AUD OP could get their own apartment for that. Even a whole house in the suburbs. I pay $1080 for a ramshackle 2 bedroom unit so OP can afford their own space for sure. The only issue is that we\u2019re in a housing crisis and people are living in their cars bc affordable housing is scarce and there\u2019s a lot of competition at viewings so depending on where OP is looking it might take a while to get a place.", "Seems silly to judge something a lot while admitting you have absolutely zero knowledge of it", "Right! Either way this plays out it will end in resentment. \nOP, just get your own place and avoid souring your relationship over money \nNTA", "My thoughts exactly 3 rooms to one, the smallest one even plus chores lol. Brothers a dick", "That may be more than fair for the brother, but not at all fair for the OP. OP should not have to pay more than 1/4 without any extra chore obligations, or less if they do help out with the kids.", "Why a third when OP would get the smallest of four bedrooms and be the fifth person living in the house. I'd offer $1k, accept a counteroffer of $1100 if that includes 1/3-1/4 of the chores and being paid to look after nephews!", "Are you originally from an English speaking country? I ask because from my experience as someone who has lived on multiple continents and in countries that speak other languages, that traveling to and living in a place like Australia will be a breeze for you. Granted I'm sure it will have its challenges like all countries do but it's quite safe, with high standards of living. I wouldn't be too nervous about it. Enjoy the experience.", "So you have to think about if the extra money for a few months is worth it for being able to to have somewhere to get to know the area and be able to take your time to look in person. \n\n\nIt's also a furnished room. So, you don't have to buy a bunch of furniture for a short term sublet and then move it all. \n\n\nLook into how much a furnished sublet somewhere would cost. Check out whatever the Craigslist or airbnb or local subreddit equivalents are and see what other options you have.\n\n\nInstead of viewing it as % of your brother's rent, view it as how much it's worth it to you to not have to worry about housing for 3 months, while you figure out where you want to live.", "Of course she is paying more even if you just divide through the adults. She is paying 2000 and they each pay 1500 so a lot less. Also they are using the 3 biggest bedrooms and OP is only getting the smallest. And I feel it would be fair to factor the kids in as well and not divide evenly through the adults given that they have their own room, use water, electricity, food and so on. At the moment the brother and wife pay for all of it by themselves and have do do all the chores. So I don\u2019t see how it is fair to have OP pay for 2/5 of the cost and also do most of the chores.", "Even if it was per adult, that would be $1,666.66. So OP is already losing on that score - and if you take into account that OP is getting the smallest bedroom (and I think that should be taken into account), then it\u2019s an even worse deal. Adding babysitting on top of that makes it more like $1000 a month or something like that would be a fairer deal."]}
