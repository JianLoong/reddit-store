He married a Scottish-born Australian and they have two boys ages 8 & 10.\n\nI will be going to Australia for work. I got the job with no help. I told him the good news and told him I\u2019m looking for help finding an apartment. I haven't been to Australia so I don't know what his house looks like and its size. I've seen his photos on FB but I've only seen their living room and kitchen. It turns out that his house has 4 bedrooms. The 2nd bedroom which is the 2nd largest room is for my nephews. The 3rd bedroom is what they use as an office/games room. The 4th bedroom, which is smaller than the 3rd bedroom, is being used as a storage room. I asked my brother how big it is and he said I can comfortably fit a queen bed.\u00a0\n\nHe offered me the 4th bedroom. It's also an advantage because his house is a 5-minute walk from a train station, ride the train for 5 stops and then walk for 10 mins from the station to my office. 20-25 minutes tops of commute. He said that he'll be more than happy to furnish the bedroom with the basics (bedframe, mattress, desk and chair) and I can buy the rest. There is a built-in wardrobe which is more than big enough for me.\u00a0\n\nMy brother is a nurse and my SIL is a dentist. I know it can be difficult to keep a house clean and orderly while they work full-time and take care of two kids. So I told him that I'll be more than happy to help with the chores, cook occasionally, maybe look after the kids after school and pay rent and utilities. With this, I'm actually expecting my share to be exactly one-third of what they pay. I didn't tell him this but he said that he and SIL will be talking about it & will get back to me.\n\nA week later, he sent me their detailed monthly spent. From what I understand, I'm basically gonna be paying more than their share. He said that for housing alone costs them almost $5000 a month and I am expected to pay around $2000 monthly. This also includes the chores I offered.\u00a0\n\nI told him that it isn't fair for me to pay more than them and still be expected to do most of the chores. My job offer is decent but I plan to save money so I can find my own apartment. His reasoning was I'm single, they have kids. I can afford to pay for anything I want. With my financial help, it will give them a relief money-wise before I move out.\u00a0\n\nI gave them a compromise that if they expect me to pay $2000, I won't be helping out in the house but more than willing to help with my nephews. He refused and said that he's doing me a favor by making it easy for me once I start my new job. I don't have to do look for an apartment and possibly get a crappy one. I also think he's compensating for the furniture he offered me for my room and the convenience of their house being near from my workplace.\n\nThe sad part is, my mom feels okay with the offer and thinks I'm crazy for missing the great opportunity.

What part of Australia are you moving too? I\u2019m in central Sydney and you could get a nice 1 bedroom for $1500/$2000 a month in the cbd. They are taking you for a ride.", "I'd be interested to know where in Australia your brother lives?  I'm in Perth, and that kind of rent would be an amazing house here.  I live in the suburbs, 10 minute drive from a train station, and could get to the city in 15 minutes train ride, and walk 10 minutes to work (if I worked in the city).\n\nI have a mortgage, but am pretty sure rent around me would be $500-600 per week for a four bedroom house.  Less than half of what your brother is apparently paying.  Are you SURE that's what he's paying?\n\nIf he's in Sydney or Melbourne, rent would be higher but I'd still investigate what the likely rent would be.  The whole thing sounds hinky to me, and like he's trying to take advantage of you.\n\nAnd that's before you even get to the helping them out part.  If you are sharing a house, some chores are fine, but not essentially working as a housekeeper and nanny along with it.", "Don\u2019t move in with him. It\u2019s going to be a headache.", "$2000 a month for 1 room and chores? He\u2019s taking advantage of you.", "Look on Gumtree (Australia) in the location you are moving to for rentals and get a room only. Living in Aus is expensive for sure, but so is childcare so the offer does not sound very fair IMO.\nYou could also look for rentals on www.realestate.com.au to get an idea of locations (search the area then click on map view) \nNTA.", "NTA normally people get paid for housekeeping and nanny work, not the other way around", "NTA\nIt's $550 pw for a 3 bedroom house, 30mins commute to Melbourne cbd door to door. \nYou can find your own flatmates and pay a lot lower than what your sibling has offered as well as have your freedom. \nDon't do it.", "NTA if you don\u2019t like the deal Turn it down. I warn you though prepare to be gaslit and called ungrateful", "NTA. You are one of five people that would live there and are expected to pay 40% for the smallest room.  Are you really that gullible? \n\nYour mom probably likes it because she feels you will be safer. Bless her heart.  \n\nGet on the computer and contact and realtor  where you a want to live. They will tell you the details. Shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple of hours. May even find a place. Plus if you only have a you can move in a month or two.", "Yes, it sounds like he's taking advantage of your situation. I think paying 1/3 of the rent would have been very generous of you. Your room would be small, and you would be contributing a lot, not just financially. They could have helped you adjust to life there, but maybe it would be better to find your own place. You could still visit and see them. NTA.", "Depending on which city, OP can also move further out and save costs that way. Sydney public transport for example is much better than Brisbane. Price, speed, frequency and useability are probably twice as good. OP could easily move 20-30 stops outside of Central and still be 'close' but anything further than 7ish stops in Brisbane is a nightmare.\n\nTemperature is also an issue. A ten minute walk through the Brisbane CBD in midsummer if OP is used to English weather for example, would be a nightmare.", "You won\u2019t have time to look. You\u2019ll be busy with chores and babysitting. And you will be guilt tripped bc they need your money. It sounds like they plan to have you stay at least a year. \nIf your brother wanted to help you, he would be recommending you apartments right now. If he knows the area so well, why doesn\u2019t he give you suggestions at least right now? He doesn\u2019t want to help you get on your own. They said that they want to get caught up financially while you live w them. Ask them, how long do they need to get caught up. \nI guarantee it would be more than three months.", "He is trying to take advantage of you. Don't allow him. Many people wrote you that for 2k you can get apartment for yourself. And here you will have addition of housework and childcare. Basically you will pay to be their nanny and cleaner.", "Can I be rude and ask your gender?  Either your brother is the golden child, or you are the daughter and he is the son.  What he is proposing is ridiculous, and that your mother goes along with it, makes it even more clearly ridiculous.", "Really? I\u2019m from Sydney but find Brisbane amazing to get around, I rely on public transport because I don\u2019t have a car. I get from home to work door-to-door in 40 minutes by bus, and I live 6km from the centre.", "sounds about right for a new mortgage though.", "Canberran here, and I'm in a three bedroom town house and we pay $550 a week. I'm seriously side eyeing the $5000 a month claim.", "Perth's the cheapest capital city in Australia afaik.", "Perth is pretty low cost of living compared to Sydney or Melbourne.  I absolutely agree with you and wrote a similar comment.", ">5 stops out of Melbourne any way you go \n\nIs there only one train stop in Melbourne?", "and tell him not to bother with the furniture. Just get a mattress and live out of a suitcase till you can leave. It sounds like brother is adding a massive 'convenience' tax.", "NTA - that\u2019s ridiculous!! For that price you can rent an Airbnb for a couple weeks to a couple months while you look for an apartment!", "I'm an Australian too. Sounds like he's lying to you about how much he's paying. That amount sounds huge. Even if he is being honest about that, no way should you be paying more than a third, you're only 1/5 of the people living in the house.", "NTA. He\u2019s your brother. You should be staying there for free, especially as it\u2019s only for a few months until you find your feet - yes you should pay for food and stuff, do the chores and help with their children but in no way should you be paying them rent (and especially not that much) they are total cheapskates and really bloody selfish.", "NTA. \nIt sounds like your brother is trying to profit from you, rather then help you out. It will be much cheaper to get your own place or to rent a room in a sharehouse. \n\nThe only draw back to that is that a lot of Australia has little to no rentals available. I had over 100 applications for a single rental in less then a week when it was listed recently. Many of them were 'employed homeless'. Professionals with the income to support the rent, but who currently have no place to live. And coming from overseas, you will not have a rental history and references for property managers to check, so you may be overlooked in favour of other tenants with a good history and references. \n\nAll that to say that your brother may end up being your only option in the short term, depending on vacancy rates of the area you are moving to. Even though what he wants to charge is extortion.", "Nta. Dont do it. Dont trade your soul. Not sure how it works there but in the US, you would only be responsible for 1/5 the rent since there are 5 ppl (kids count too). Take the time to look around, you will be grateful. Then & only then, if you want to enjoy time w the kids, its on your terms. Your brother isnt just trying to take advantage of you financially, but every single aspect, from chores to babysitting. Then wants you to be grateful?! You could probably rent a room or stay in a hotel or hostel a lot cheaper", "I\u2019m near Fremantle in Western Australia, there\u2019s some very nice, expensive homes near me. The most expensive at the moment is a 5 bedroom, 4 bathroom for 2k a week. The usual tho is 4x2 for about 1k.theres also 2 or 3 x 1 for about 3-400 weekly.if I was having to pay 2k a month, plus babysitting, plus housework, plus food, plus utilities, plus only having 1 room with 4 other people (1/3 of everything means you\u2019re also paying part of the kids share that the parents should be covering btw) I know which way I\u2019d go.\n\nETA.  NTA", "NTA and he is not doing you a favour. Find an appartment for yourself and go and enjoy your alone time.", "NTA. I live in Aus and the house I\u2019m currently in is a 3 bed and rent is only about $1300 a month and I split those costs with 3 other people. I don\u2019t know what area your moving to but $2000 for one room is appalling and your brother is definitely taking advantage of you.", "Yeah...seems kinda like you're getting reamed tbh. Which city will you be in? You could potentially get your own place for under that a month for sure here in Perth. The issue would be you may have a spot of trouble trying to lock in your own place to rent though. I don't know how or why it happens occasionally, but we are in one of those times where rentals are scarce and it's pretty intense to find a place to lease anywhere. \n\nIf I were you I'd air bnb or cheap but not gross motel til I could find a different sharesy house or my own little flat in the CBD near your work.", "Checks the rates in the area and see what you can get for 2k a month", "He can ask whatever he wants, you're free to decline and find other options. It also seems messier because you're both coming into this thinking you're doing each other favors on top of negotiating rent and division of chores.\n\nFWIW it doesn't sound like a very good deal. He seems like he's charging you the \"singles tax\" as if single people don't need/want to save. Quite frankly with kids his family is taking up even more real estate than 2/3. Your mom likely has no perspective on what things cost and he's probably presenting a rosy picture to her. If it was me as the brother I can't imagine charging more than a few hundred just to offset whatever additional costs I might incur if I couldn't take you on for free. This negotiation is not off to a good start. Maybe it's for the best you say thanks but no thanks before it gets personal.\n\nJust my opinion but I don't know why you'd want to move in with him and be a 3rd parent if you're financially capable of living alone and have your own life and free time to yourself lol.", "He\u2019s offering you a room, paying for some parts of it himself.\n\nIt does seem expensive. But you don\u2019t have to accept. You\u2019re not entitled to be treated fairly.
