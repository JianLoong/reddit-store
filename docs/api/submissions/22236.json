As far back as I\u2019ve known him he\u2019s had a crush on Ava (26F), his wife\u2019s Gwen (27F)\u2019s best friend. Back in college, Ava always kept him as a backup and a shoulder to cry on when her relationships didn\u2019t work out.\n\nWhy would he agree to go out with Gwen when he was in love with Ava is anyone\u2019s best guess. I\u2019m less confused on why he married her. His mom loved Gwen like the daughter she never had. Gwen always seemed happy with Will so I didn\u2019t think it was my place to judge.\n\nRecently, Ava went through a bad divorce and Gwen let her stay with her and Will. I went to their house yesterday and I noticed that Will and Ava kept complimenting each other. It was platonic but so blatant I felt embarrassed for Gwen. She looked like she was about to cry.\n\nI made an excuse and pulled Will aside to ask him wtf he was doing. Will smirked and basically said that when Gwen gets insecure she acts different. She becomes very needy and desperate for affection in his own words. And cries. He likes that? So basically he wants Gwen to cry and be needy for affection and it\u2019s easier by playing on her insecurities about Ava. \n\nI lost it. I told him he was a manipulator psycho and I was going to tell his wife about this and that he\u2019s in love with Ava if he didn\u2019t stop being manipulative. Will was furious and said he didn\u2019t like Ava and if I told Gwen what he told me he would make sure everyone knew all the dirt he had on me since we were kids. I would be ruining a happy relationship. I left in disgust.

Hate to say it but maybe he wanted to be with Gwen so he could always have an excuse to be around Ava\u2026", "NTA \n\nWill isn\u2019t a \u201cgood guy\u201d, he\u2019s a manipulative jerk who wants to have his cake and eat it. He is purposefully making his wife insecure, and using her best friend to do it. Those are not the hallmarks of a *good guy*.", "NTA and tbh i think id start getting petty.\n\ncompliment Gwen on anything and everything.\n\ncompletely ignore anything ava does and just chuckle anytime Will compliments ava\n\nmay be childish but what can they say. youre just doing the same thing ava and will are doing", "NTA. Your friend isn't a good guy. Good guys, don't flirt with their wife's best friend, who they've secretly been in love with for some time. Good guys don't exploit their wife's insecurities. Your friend is a garbage person and is either sleeping with Ava or  close to crossing an inappropriate line.", "NTA,\n\nThis is a bridge worth burning. Your friend isn\u2019t a good person and shouldn\u2019t be treating his wife like that. Do it, give him what he deserves", "NTA. Your friend is an abuser. Plain and simple.", "NTA. You sure he\u2019s a good guy?", "NTA. Will wants to have his cake and eat it. And clearly it\u2019s all about him and his ego. I personally would be foregoing this friendship with Will because he doesn\u2019t sound like a good person, so why would he be a good friend to you? \n\nI would tell Gwen that you are here for her and leave the situation completely. Nothing good is going to come out of this, two women are going to be severely hurt, you will lose a \u2018friend\u2019 (although I would argue it\u2019s not much of a loss) and Will will walk away feeling like he did nothing wrong.", "NTA - Let him tell on you. Whatever you did, you did AS A KID. He\u2019s an adult now and he needs to start acting like one.", "NTA I would tell her anyway. There's no way she could want that woman staying with them if she knew that. Or does she already know and that's why she's getting upset?", "It's not a happy relationship. He emotionally abuses his wife. NTA.", "NTA, and honestly, your friend sounds like a narcissist. Feel so sorry for poor Gwen.", "NTA\nI\u2019d concentrate on letting Gwen know her self-worth rather than telling him what you think of him though. He doesn\u2019t care and it won\u2019t change anything. Tell Gwen she deserves better and that you\u2019ll be here for her. Preferably before they have kids.", "NTA. Tell the wife, drop Will as a friend. seems to me like Ava knows exactly what is going on so probably doesn't care but I'd probably tell her how cruel it is and that if she's going to take her shot at Will do so or leave the house. Maybe she's too self centred or stupid to understand what Will is doing and needs someone to point it out.", "NTA Will sounds like a despicable human being. I would tell Gwen but you have to prepare yourself for the possibility that she won't listen. If she doesn't  you will become the villain in both of their eyes. She might have blinders on when it comes to him and refuse to see the truth. Sometimes it's easier to pretend.", "ESH. \n\nBefore I explain why, let me give my basic general view. \"My friend mistreats his wife\" is tricky. If your friendship is not in jeopardy (let's be real, it could well not he), I believe your messaging to both should be, \"I can't believe my friend mistreats his wife.\" In other words, they should both know that you know his conduct was inexcusable and you are loyal to both to your friend and to what is right. But understand this: it is the wife's role to save herself, your role is limited to making sure she has free will. I do not believe the integrity of their marriage is any more of your business than that.\n\nI agree with you warning your friend you're about to talk to his wife if he doesnt stop. You just went a tad overboard by threatening to drag old dirt to her attention. I also don't think it's necessarily good or bad for you to be specific at all to her about what you saw and what your friend told you that you did not like. Saying you did not like it is thevkey point. I in no way endorse your friend's behavior and think you losing your temper was a good thing.", "NTA but also kinda YTA. sounds like you want to control other peoples lives and you haven't got anything better to do with your time. Plus a little jealousy and desire to stir the pot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo learn to paint, get a career, play an instrument\n\nThere's 8 billion people in the world, go around shoving your nose into someone elses personal business is going to leave you with no friends by the time you're 40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest thing for you to do, just go hang out with not jerks and forget them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My family kicked me out and disowned me and Will and his family let me stay with them. Will was the only person in school not to shun me and he stood up for me when I got bullied. He gave some of his college fund to me so I could also attend. He was my best friend which sucks when I think about how he treats his wife.", "Will\u2019s always been a great friend to me but I have to set some boundaries because he can\u2019t be treating people like this. \n\nI feel bad for Gwen. Don\u2019t really give a shit about Ava because she\u2019s flirting with a married man.", "He\u2019s always been flirty with Ava when Gwen was around in college.

He was way more normal with Ava when Gwen wasn\u2019t around. \n\nI think Gwen has a big heart and couldn\u2019t say no to Ava after her divorce.", "I feel bad for her too. He treats her well in general, takes her out on dates, drops cash on her all the time, calls her the love of his life, cooks for her, but he also can be scummy", "I agree with this, don't bring up the past. Keep it focused on the present and on his emotional abuse, otherwise he can easily make it look like you're slinging dirt in a shitty fight rather than intervening in the case of abuse.", "Not sure where you get that from the OP. A friend was openly abusive to his wife and she tried to get him to do the right thing... controlling? IN that case any advice you ever give to a friend is controlling.", "That\u2019s really sad\u2026 and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s great.

You could pretend you became bi curious while you\u2019re at it ;)", "Gwen needs a friend.

Gwen I think they have a weird/odd friendship dating all the way back to college.  if you ever need someone to talk/vent to my doors always open.  I love Will like a brother but notice he is nowhere close to perfect. \n\nIf she wants to know your opinion then ball is in her court.  Your not betraying Will but not covering up or lying by omission for him either", "So maybe he is a \"good\" guy to his friends, but he is a terrible husband. Just like Ava isn't a good \"best friend\". Do they both keep Gwen around to make themselves feel better about themselves? \n\nNTA by the way. \n\nIf you were to tell Gwen about the manipulation (maybe not the crush, but that he enjoys making her cry to trigger her),would the fallout for you be something you could handle? Because that woman deserves to know what she is married to.", "I think sometimes it\u2019s hard to see how a friend can treat you well, but suck at treating others.

Ava is gorgeous. Gwen is cute but a bit mid, like the type of girl you like only when she has a personality\u2019\n\nShe really needs to drop you all and move away. Because if those around her can\u2019t see all her good points and see her beauty in it then really you all are just dragging her down. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to compete for her husbands affection, and Will shouldn\u2019t be making her feel insecure and thriving on that. Honestly, I feel for that girl.", "Yeah to do stuff even too many weird compliments and stuff in front of his wife and acting this way while actively hurting his wife's feelings just to get some sort of self validation is twisted for sure. You're definitely not the asshole but damn tough spot to be in but way to be a bro and pull him to the side if you're a witness to it again in person I'd just call them both on their bullshit. Or even maybe tell the other Ava or whoever he told you he is kinda actively using her to purposely hurt his wife's feelings and she may feel differently about it and put a stop to it if she's a halfway decent person and they're not like having an affair or anything weird.", "That's all nice enough, but no amount of dates or gifts makes up for purposefully upsetting your wife for your own gain. You're NTA, and you were right to call him on his bullshit.", "Gwen\u2019s a nice person. I feel bad for her sometimes.", "I've learned that anytime someone starts off with saying someone is a nice/good person they're about to explain how said person is in no way a nice/good person. \n\nWhy they try to defend these people is beyond me but the fact that they feel they have to speaks volumes, if they really were an upstanding person of quality they wouldn't need anyone to say that they are, their actions would would show that.", "What's the big deal? It's significantly faster than typing 'average-looking'", "Yeah if Will\u2019s being honest and doing it so Gwen\u2019s desperate for his affection in his words, wtf is Ava\u2019s deal? She\u2019s basically flirting with a married man, her best friends husband.", "Yeah I\u2019ll call it out again when I see it. \n\nHonestly his confession got me thinking. If he\u2019s complimenting Ava not because he wants an affair but because he wants to make his wife insecure, wtf was he doing in college? Because he definitely was way more flirty with Ava when Gwen was around.\n\nI think Ava\u2019s ego would get bruised if I told her he was doing this to make Gwen insecure. She\u2019s not my favorite person", "exactly! not to take away from that extremely manipulative and cringy attitude but holy cow poor Gwen getting crapped on from 2 of the closest people to her", "I mean you said it yourself.  Ava's dude fell through and she needs her backup.   \n\n\nAnd Will, who you think is a \"good guy\" is more than willing to sacrifice his wife's emotional state and feelings to satisfy her.", "Pleeassee tell her and do an update!"]}
