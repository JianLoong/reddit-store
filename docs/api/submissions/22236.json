If your friendship is not in jeopardy (let's be real, it could well not he), I believe your messaging to both should be, \"I can't believe my friend mistreats his wife.\" In other words, they should both know that you know his conduct was inexcusable and you are loyal to both to your friend and to what is right. But understand this: it is the wife's role to save herself, your role is limited to making sure she has free will. I do not believe the integrity of their marriage is any more of your business than that.\n\nI agree with you warning your friend you're about to talk to his wife if he doesnt stop. You just went a tad overboard by threatening to drag old dirt to her attention. I also don't think it's necessarily good or bad for you to be specific at all to her about what you saw and what your friend told you that you did not like. Saying you did not like it is thevkey point. I in no way endorse your friend's behavior and think you losing your temper was a good thing.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
