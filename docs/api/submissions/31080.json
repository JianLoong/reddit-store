You need to impress upon them how cruel they were to Isaac by asking personal questions of a stranger in public. You don\u2019t have to go to your parents for thanksgiving, either. \n\nI\u2019m sure your parents will say \u201cwell I didn\u2019t mean\u201d and that\u2019s bs, It doesn\u2019t matter what they meant when they hurt and embarrassed their child\u2019s partner in public. That\u2019s disgusting behavior.\n\nYWNBTA if you went without Isaac, but I\u2019d make them acknowledge what they did was wrong and apologize before I\u2019d consider going, imo.", "YWNBTA, but you will be if you don't tell them why. \n\nThey need to be aware that their questions are offensive and Issac doesn't want to come to Thanksgiving because of their intrusive questions. They need to change their behavior if they want Issac to feel comfortable around them.", "See if you can attend Issac's family thanksgiving, his parents sound like much better company. (YWNBTA if you do go to your family celebration, but you will be TA if you sugarcoat why Issac isn't coming with you.)", "Your parents owe your bf an apology, and you need to tell them that. They\u2019ve clearly been fair too invasive, and you probably should have put a stop to that long before their questioning ended. Going to say YTA for not stepping in given that you were aware they were overly invasive questions and it would make your bf feel uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nWho the fuck asks someone why it took them so long to be adopted?", "Communicate", "YWNBTA for not subjecting Issac to another round of interrogation at the hands of your parents.  I've never met him, and I already feel sorry for him.  \n\nYour parents might mean well... but they're mentally torturing him with their incessant questions.  \n\nSeriously. Please don't make him go there.  He's already been through enough.", "Honestly, I think YTA if you go at all. While skipping a holiday can seem extreme, if your parents have refused to listen more than once, then maybe you should give them hard consequences. Perhaps easier to write a message than on a call, but either way state, \"Mom, Dad, I have talked to you repeatedly about not asking Issac questions about his childhood. He has already stated it's a painful topic, and he does not care to discuss it, yet you have ignored both him and me. Consequently, he does not feel comfortable attending Thanksgiving with you, and so we are going to his parents together. You owe him an apology for your behavior, no matter what your intentions were. Until such time as you do, and agree to drop discussion of his past, we will not be visiting.\"\n This is also good for your future. Whether Issac and you stay together, or you have other relationships later, setting boundaries as an adult with your parents now will help you in the future. They may not want to acknowledge that you are an adult, and it may cause a fight now, but holding your ground solidifies your independence and partners treatment later.", "I think you and Isaac should do your own thanksgiving or maybe you can spend it with his family. And let your parents know that until they can respect Issacs boundaries, you will not be coming around.\n\nNTA", "Not the AH but your parents sensing that this relationship may be more serious or potentially permanent would like to know Issac.  Cue awkward and embarrassing questions.  Whether people like to admit it or not, childhood experiences, parental models, relationships do shape the child into the adult they become.  Your parents are trying to figure out what makes your boyfriend tick and whether or not there are any flags (patterns of behaviour that could hurt you in the future).  They are being good parents with your best interests at heart.  As you have pointed out he does have a tentative seal of approval. \n\nThat said, don't let Issac alienate you from your parents as we are sensing that ultimatums are in the shadows as he is prepared to spend the festive season alone (guilt tripping you) rather than with family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
