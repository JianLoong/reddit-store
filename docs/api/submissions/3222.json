I really fail to see how this is a fireable offense. The password can be changed back. No harm done. \n\nYTA for making you friend panic over nothing.", "yta\n\nif he can reset the coach password, the coach made a mistake. And even if he had made a mistake, no one gets fired for something so small.", "YTA\n\nYou have no clue what you are talking about. You don't know this business's protocols or what is grounds for termination.  It seems your friend made a mistake that is probably easy to correct.\n\nYour friend is right - you caused needless panic.  Is this your usual M.O. to immediately advise worst case scenario?", "YTA. Don't joke about people's livelihoods.", "You're not the asshole but you're kinda dumb. Mistakes happen and you freaked out your friend for no reason. All he's gotta do is tell the coach that you made an oopsy and admin privileges will be able to straighten it out in like 5 minutes, tops.", "YTA. This is not a fireable offense by any means as it sounds like it's the personal account of the coach.\n\nAccidents happen and no loss of life or business occurred.\n\nThe password can be reset. The coach if MORE of an idiot for giving out a personal account.", "YTA, people make mistakes, they're not going to be fired over that.", "Coming from someone with anxiety, YTA. That is not a fireable offense as it can be corrected.", "YTA\n\nThis a fixable mistake your friend will be fine. You on the other hand are a jerk.", "YTA but what sort of tyrant do you work for/been raised by that you think a simple mistake like this, one that costs the company zero time or money is something to be fired over? I'm very serious here because that is not something that happens in a normal job that doesn't involve tinpot dictators as bosses/supervisors.", "Was it grinning, slap on the shoulder,  \"hey dumbass, way to go, you're gonna get fired hahah!\" as in a joke? Or was it with actual serious concern? We joke around all the time at work with stuff like like being promoted for incompetence etc. \n\nFirst off, a training computer or lab, accounts should have segregated user names and passwords. Really shouldn't need a coach password for that. So if anything, that coach needs to learn some computer account control. \n\nAs for being a fired for this? A quick e-mail, or ticket submission online, call to IT and they'd have that opened up. Gonna go with YTA for not being funny or aware of how computers work.", "YTA What are you doing to help in this situation?", "YTA.\n\nCool down and don\u2019t make such assumptions.", "Yta. Friends are supportive and reassuring. Predicting someone's humiliation and loss of employment is not friendly. Even if you knew for a fact that your friend would be fired, telling them so would be an asshole move. Friends stand in solitary. Friends comfort. Friends are back-up posses and build one another up. You're not a friend. Yta.", "YTA. What serious damage did your friend cause?", "YTA you seem\u2026\u2026.a little misinformed about things. No one is getting fired for accidentally resetting a password, that\u2019s ridiculous.", "YTA - a mistake like that is rarely ever a firing offense, and you riled your friend unnecessarily.", "YTA, but this also made me Lol. That's a bit dramatic. Your friend could just change the password back, or explain what happened. Seems like an honest mistake. I use my boss' login for a few things, and have had it make me change the password when I logged in, and was not a big deal. I just told him it made me change it, and what it was (I just change the number at the end usually).", "YTA Wow. You're not a friend at all.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t know company policy. You\u2019re just causing unnecessary panic.", "YTA. \n\nAre you just like... really young and inexperienced in the work environment? I know of no decent company where this would be anything close to a fireable offense. At worst, the coach will put in a ticket with IT to have their password changed if they can't do it themselves and it'll be a lesson to the company to have separate user logins for this kind of training. \n\n>>Did I say anything wrong?\n\nHmmm, let's see. You told your friend something ridiculously stress-inducing for them when you have no evidence or reason to believe that will definitely happen as if it were a certainty. You have no actual idea that your friend will be fired but acted like you're some kind of expert. Yeah, I'd say that's wrong.", "Yta I guess, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d qualify as an actual asshole for the comment but since the nature of the sub is to choose who was more asshole-like. I don\u2019t think accidentally changing the password is a huge deal, the coach can just change it back unless I\u2019m misunderstanding. Therefore, I think inciting panic by mentioning firing was unnecessary but wouldn\u2019t make you an asshole outside of this sub lol.", "YTA", "YTA. Why would you tell someone they are likely to get fired over a small mistake like a password reset?\n\n\"Because they are dumb and careless\"?\n\nSounds like you need more experience in the life of adults and how things work in the real world.\n\nWtf. Please never try and get a job in management.", "YTA. Why would someone be fired for that? Why did you deliberately try to freak your \"friend\" out? Do you hate you hate them? Are you trying to sabotage their job? Are you jealous?", "YTA for starting drama.", "YTA. Their boss might be annoyed but is unlikely to fire them over a small, fixable mistake. Even if you honestly thought they would be fired, what purpose did it serve to tell them that? You basically just caused them to be very stressed.", "YTA. Resetting a password isn't even misconduct, let alone gross misconduct. You're no friend if you come out with rubbish like that", "Yta\n\nThat isnt how passwords or accounts WORK. The COACH borked up if anyone had access to change their password, if... IF... ANYONE is at risk of being fired its the COACH", "Okay so if your friend has a \u201ccoach\u201d in their job, then they\u2019re still in training. Most companies see \u201ctraining periods\u201d as the time in which your new employees are going to make stupid mistakes. And honestly OP? As far as this goes, it wouldn\u2019t even register on my radar as a \u201cstupid mistake\u201d. I\u2019d just change the password back. What you said to your friend was very unnecessary.\n\nHere\u2019s some free life advice for you: it\u2019s better to remain silent and have others think you\u2019re a fool, than to open your mouth and prove them right. You\u2019re not an ass, but you\u2019re definitely a fool.", "YTA - This seems like a huge overreaction to a small issue that was (is) absolutely none of your business anyway", "YTA. People make silly mistakes. Most of the time it\u2019s not a firing issue. Don\u2019t make your friends nervous and paranoid.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t know for a fact someone will get fired. Once I became a manager I realized why people who weren\u2019t great did not get fired. It\u2019s because good and smart people are hard to find. \nA few years ago I was working for a temp company and they had me manage a mobile home park. There was one employee to help and she did cleaning and maintenance stuff. I thought to myself wow she has a bad attitude. But to be fair, she\u2019s also really bad at her job. \nSo I was fairly certain she would get fired after I left and she did. But I never told her because a. I didn\u2019t know that for a fact and b. she was definitely the kind of person to get revenge.  c she probably won\u2019t have blamed me. Often it\u2019s better to say nothing.", "YTA.\n\nFired over a password reset? That\u2019s grade a nonsense. I\u2019ve never seen that get more than a \u201cseriously, be more careful\u201d in over a decade around IT and logins.", "YTA. Yes, you immediately jumping to make your friend panic over nothing is you being an asshole", "YTA not gonna be fired you\u2019re just making them anxious.", "Yeah YTA. Sounds like you are wishful thinking based on you in the comments calling your friend \u201cdumb and careless\u201d. It\u2019s not a big deal and her coming clean about it straight away should solve it up. You are trying to bring your friend down and make her feel bad for no apparent reason which usually means you are doing it to make yourself feel better.", "YTA \n\nHow in blue hell is this something someone could get fired for?", "YTA.

Most places make employees quit, they don\u2019t want to be held liable for unemployment benefits. Employees can behave awfully, but unless there is some sort of physical altercations rarely are most places firing people. At least that had been my experience when talking with friends who are managers and want to fire people but the companies say no. I know where I work it\u2019s exceedingly hard to get fired as well.

Employees are human.", "Normally password resets are not automatic. There's an email with a reset link going to the account owner's to do the actual reset.
