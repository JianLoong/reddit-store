I cut her off immediately, again. When she tried to cry to everyone else about it, I heard about it from them. So I explained what had actually happened. Turns out, shocking I know, that she had given them the impression that what she did wasn't nearly that bad and was perfectly acceptable by societal standards. It wasn't. If she did that to them they would have never spoken to her again. Round 2 of NC lasted about 2 years, cuz she wanted back in. I allowed LC  of varying degrees for years, but with incredibly firm boundaries. She tried a few things and again we had to rinse and repeat. She finally stopped when I explained she can either behave or we can go back to NC. During that time she also stopped getting co-dependent support for her bs after multiple people witnessed first hand how bad her behavior was. A lot of it stemmed solely from wanting drama and wanting people to think she's the parent of the year. Needless to say she was not. So my advice is, address it honestly and bluntly with those who keep brining it up to u. And to her, b quite firm that this behavior is unacceptable going forward, but if u do that b prepared to cut her off. She will get mad, cry around about it and play the victim. Or u can learn to live with it.", "Clothing sizes aren't about perceptions. They're about asking people what size they wear and then buying that.
