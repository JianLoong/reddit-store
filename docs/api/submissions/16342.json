Turns out, shocking I know, that she had given them the impression that what she did wasn't nearly that bad and was perfectly acceptable by societal standards. It wasn't. If she did that to them they would have never spoken to her again. Round 2 of NC lasted about 2 years, cuz she wanted back in. I allowed LC  of varying degrees for years, but with incredibly firm boundaries. She tried a few things and again we had to rinse and repeat. She finally stopped when I explained she can either behave or we can go back to NC. During that time she also stopped getting co-dependent support for her bs after multiple people witnessed first hand how bad her behavior was. A lot of it stemmed solely from wanting drama and wanting people to think she's the parent of the year. Needless to say she was not. So my advice is, address it honestly and bluntly with those who keep brining it up to u.

And trust me, it will embarrass her because she never expected you to actually wear it. And being 4 sizes too big it will look bad. Make sure to wear tank top underneath, lol.", "NTA. But your mother is unlikely to change. It is wrong that she is still trying to force you into her mold and ignoring what you say. You came up with a good solution and it worked for a while.\n\nFor whatever reason though, she really wanted to have this jumper. Why not sure? To fit in with her mental image and she is probably struggling to see you as an adult and not an extension of her self. Dressing you all alike is a little gross and glad you have the confidence to address boundaries.\n\nThink with sweater, I'd have accepted it but stressed how great it would be for keeping me warm in bed or taking the pets out. If asked why not wearing out, well it is lovely, will make me think of her every time I see it but it doesn't match the rest of my wardrobe so... If otherwise good mother, then giving her a little space to adjust to having children she can't control can help. But it is a conditional present so change the framing.", "NTA but next time I would just donate it to good will. Works out well if she wanted it for herself too, then she won't pull this shenanigans again.", "NTA, throwing away the receipt for a gift sounds to me like intentional goading. She knew what she was doing", "NTA - you are too old for your Mom to buy clothes. But if she insists on this just say thank you and donate to salvation army.", "NTA, \n\nShe basically shopping for herself, not for you. I would have found it very insulting", "NTA! \n\nMy mom was like that my entire life. She would tell me I\u2019m beautiful but if I lost 20lbs I would look better, and be upset if was insecure about my look.\n\nShe insisted on giving me clothes I hated and always called me \u201cdifficult\u201d.\nWhen I graduated she gave me jewelry a gigantic gold double shell with a blue stone on it. I closed the box fast in hopes that would change.\n\nWhen I moved she would send me packages with clothes \u201cto make you more modern\u201d. Everything had extremely bright prints and was 2 sizes smaller. The clothes look like it came from a mafia movie where I played the wife \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOne year she asked me what I wanted for my birthday. I told her exactly. A green purse from a store she knew, sent link photo. I was expecting that purse. NOPE not what I got. She said it was time to grow up and send me a brown leather bag with gold details \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAll this to just tell you to avoid years of guilt. Make peace. Your mom is not changing. She will keep trying. You are not wrong at all to have your own style. Tell her that!", "NTA\n\nYour mother doesn't know who you are, and doesn't really care, it seems.", "NTA but we're taught how to graciously receive gifts and asking for the receipt is the same as saying 'I don't like it'.\n\nJust putting it out there, next time just smile, say thank you and then take it back to the store without a receipt.\n\nSome people are bad at gifts, it's a jumper, was it worth the grief?", "YTA I think it's fine to ask for her to save receipts. I think it would be easier giving her a list of things to choose from. You can make one on Amazon. Asking for only gift cards takes the fun out of picking out the gift.", "ESH, can you not say \u201cthanks\u201d and throw it in the donation bin?\n\nI feel like gift giving has entirely lost its meaning when there are strict rules and entitlement to get \u201cexactly what you want\u201d like ugh.", "YTA. It\u2019s a gift. I would take anything my mom gives me. And as an adult don\u2019t even expect a gift at this point. Anything is something. It\u2019s the thought.", "NAH. Your mom hasn\u2019t said anything directly to you about it, so I wouldn\u2019t even bring it up.", "NTA... Plese dont give me cloths as gifts.", "I think the answer might be, \u2018gee thanks mom. But this isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll wear. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make a great item to donate though.\u2019 If she asks for it back, then gently say that she\u2019ll be taking an item from someone who may need it, and actually enjoy it.\n\nNTA.\n\nObject, but gently", "I would be so glad that it was \u201c4 sizes too big\u201d as that would give me a fantastic reason to reject the gift. And you can justify WHY you want gift cards as \u201cit\u2019s difficult for you to remember my clothing size as you get older\u201d.\n\nMy mother bought me a fleecy skirt/jacket combo one Xmas in a \u201cbaby poop brown\u201d - I was so glad that it was too big for me. She didn\u2019t always buy me horrible clothes - I still wear one jumper she bought me and she has been dead for 15 years. Why she thought I would like that skirt/jacket I have no idea. Shapeless, horrible colour, the skirt wouldn\u2019t even stay up over my hips it was so large. It did make fantastic cleaning cloths.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing to do with passive aggressive behavior is to be blithely innocent and go only by what the person says to me.\n\nShe wants to complain to others? Cool, she\u2019s processing her feelings. It\u2019s handled. \n\nShe makes sad faces and sighs \u201cI\u2019ll keep it if you can\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d Great! Saves you from dropping it off at Goodwill! \n\nSkip off into the sunset with the joy of not being burdened with a horrible sweater. She set herself up for this, and until she wants to sit down and have an adult conversation with you, as far as you\u2019re concerned everything is going great. \n\nShe knew what you wanted. She wants you to feel bad for being yourself, and well\u2026 she gets to be disappointed. That\u2019s a her problem and none of yours.", "So you got a hideous jumper for Xmas\u2026 welcome to the club. it\u2019s basically the epitome of Xmas gifts! XD", "NTA.

She wants you to have something.

You are both seeing this as a rejection of each other.  She wants you to be more like her and you want her to see you as an independent person\n\nThat is the convo to have.", "The fact it was three sizes too big was pretty telling she wanted it for herself, honestly.", "Yeah NTA. \n\nMy family was the same - my dad kept wanting to gift me things I liked 20 years ago...and my mom kept gifting clothes she bought for herself but only wore once (so, not a gift). Was called an 'ungrateful bitch' by my aunt on many occasions if I dared to be honest about not liking it/ asking for a receipt. I never understood why they'd rather I lie - but most people don't really care what you like, they buy what th\u00e8y like", "A part of the sweater gift was the expectation that I had to wear it. Often. In public. Doing otherwise lead to her being upset with other similar gifts in the past. I explained it better in another comment reply.", "\u201cHere\u2019s this present i got you instead of the gift you explicitly asked for! i know you will hate it and will never wear it.

It's the thought that counts, and there's no thought in Mom's gifts.", "I would argue that when someone gives a gift with a hidden agenda, it changes the dynamic.

I had a rough childhood and teen years (not my moms fault) I figured by late teens, early 20s I would have been dead or in prison. So for me I am just grateful for people to be in my life.

This is like the hardest thing in the world to fight. Family just has a way of making you feel ridiculous for having even the most reasonable of boundaries.
