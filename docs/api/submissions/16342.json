Most of the time he will just give me his card and have me order any gifts for anyone in our family as I\u2019m really good at finding deals. I myself would rather have cash or gift cards as I\u2019m on a fixed income due to being disabled and that extra birthday/Christmas money helps me to by myself something nice that I normally wouldn\u2019t buy.
