Turns out, shocking I know, that she had given them the impression that what she did wasn't nearly that bad and was perfectly acceptable by societal standards. It wasn't. If she did that to them they would have never spoken to her again. Round 2 of NC lasted about 2 years, cuz she wanted back in. I allowed LC  of varying degrees for years, but with incredibly firm boundaries. She tried a few things and again we had to rinse and repeat. She finally stopped when I explained she can either behave or we can go back to NC. During that time she also stopped getting co-dependent support for her bs after multiple people witnessed first hand how bad her behavior was. A lot of it stemmed solely from wanting drama and wanting people to think she's the parent of the year. Needless to say she was not. So my advice is, address it honestly and bluntly with those who keep brining it up to u.

My mom is very similar to OPs, but religious flavored.  If we didn't like what she likes, we were the problem--and we were doing it on purpose.  I learned all kinds of manipulative tricks to make my life bearable and eventually even fun--things like reframing arguments to give yourself the moral high ground and ignoring subtext to force the person to admit what they really want.  (Example--my mom was very into giving stuff to others to appear generous, so I would've reframed getting rid of the sweater: Mom, my friend saw that sweater you gave me and loved it; it reminded them of 'x' event in their life. I felt like God meant for them to have it.  Of course she would argue with me, but she can't argue that being generous is bad or doing what God wants is bad, so as long as I reply to every argument with a variation of the reframing, I win. Her: but I gave you that sweater, how can you give it up if you love me? Me: but friend needed it so much more than me; how can you ask me to be so selfish? Etc. Etc). Expert level is to pretend to be the narcissist and mirror their behavior back to them--next Christmas your mom gets a sweater you know she will hate, and if she doesn't like it, you will be devastated --you spent months choosing that for her, etc, etc. Warning: these techniques require you to know your mother very well; my mom is very into Christian giving, pick what values your mom has and use them against her.  Even the most narcissistic does not want to look like an obvious hypocrite in front of others, so especially use these techniques around non-family members, as narcissists usually consider family as extensions of themselves and don't mind being hypocritical to them as much. If you're less extroverted, you can also use Grey Rock techniques to 'fight' back in a more passive way. Also do not expect any of this to change her overall behavior, but eventually it should change her behavior with you specifically.

You got nothing to apologize for. Her issues with your reaction are just that - her issues to sort out. (If she really wants to sort them out, she can start with why she feels the need to give you whatever you absolutely don't want.\n\nThose sources giving you the 'wind' can shut up. If they are doing it at Mom's behest, then they can stop being her little flying monkeys. If they are doing it of their own accord, then they can stop inserting their second-hand gossip where it doesn't belong. Just stop listening to them; tell them they can keep that info to themselves.\n\nDon't do/say/offer anything regarding the sweater. If you get a similar gift next time, just smile and say, \"Thanks, mom. I won't be wearing this, though. Why don't you keep it since it's your style? Otherwise, I'll just pass it on to someone else.\" She'll probably whine again. You can say, \"Mom, you know this is your taste, not mine. If you'd like to buy something I'd like, the H&M cards worked well or I can give you other ideas. If you are bent on giving only what is more your taste, then you know it's not my taste and don't need to be surprised or offended when I don't keep it.\"", "NTA but stop thinking your mum is just dumb and start accepting that she\u2019s not really caring or nurturing the way you describe\u2026 she\u2019s passive aggressive and a bit of a bully not to mention a control freak. My grandmother would do similar shit to this all the time in order to centre herself and her feelings about other peoples preferences through gifts. She would gift my sister and I formal velvet dresses instead of the game boy game we wanted and then act all hurt and confused when we didn\u2019t have this big positive emotional reaction to opening them. She did the same thing to my mother all her life and well into my adulthood when I just started asking cash for college and stopped accepting gifts from her at all. This type of gift giving is just covert narcissism with extra window dressing. Your mother is doing it intentionally either to signal to you the kind of daughter she wishes you were, or to fish for sympathy from family and friends later after she paints you as ungrateful. There was no winning this situation; it was a set-up. Your mother doesn\u2019t like who you are and wants to control you into being more amicable to who she wants you to be for her aka a girl who loves pink and doesn\u2019t notice her overbearing mothers passive aggressive behaviour.", "NTA. Whenever I give a gift, especially clothes, I include a gift receipt \ud83e\uddfe whenever possible, it's just easier in case it's the wrong size, style, they'd prefer something else, etc. Someone not liking a gift is not a personal insult to the gift giver.

You're presumably an adult by now, or at least, not 9 years old. There is no entitlement to gifts, and you should simply buy what you want for yourself. A gift is therefore not about the item, but about the sentiment behind it. Your mother took the time and put thought into buying you something. The fact that its something you don't like, is irrelevant. You thank her and carry on with your life. Want proof? Here it is: you still have other sweaters to wear, but you made your mother cry, over a thing you don't even need.  What a Merry Christmas!", "What has happened to society? Were you all raised by wolverines? \n\nYou know what you do when someone gives you a gift of an ugly sweater you'll never actually wear? You say 'thank you' and then quietly donate it to Goodwill. \n\nYou were not charged for the ugly sweater. You're under no compulsion to wear the ugly sweater. I would die in my blood before telling my mother i didn't like the sweater she got me. \n\nYTA\n\nPeople with bad manners are always TA.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother has shown you - at Christmas ! - that she doesn't care about your preferences, and that she isn't interested in getting to know you as a unique individual. That must sting terribly. She has given you a fake gift that appears to have been intended for herself all along, but has somehow managed to make herself the victim, and her \"feelings\" the most important topic to discuss. She has also been sharing her version of events with 3rd parties in such a way that those 3rd parties feel compelled to contact you about that. \n\nYour mother is very, very far outside of the norm of decent parental behaviour.\n\nHaving a conversation with her about this is going to be counterproductive. If you try to smooth out her \"hurt\" feelings, you're just reinforcing her self-centered attitude, rewarding her for creating drama, and acknowledging that she was justified in creating drama and involving 3rd parties. If you try to talk about *your own* hurt feelings, she's probably going to react 10x worse to that than she did to the original polite request for a receipt, and she's going to accuse you of horrible things to 3rd parties (like claiming that you've been angry at her for months). \n\nI really don't see any good that can come from a conversation with your mother.\n\nYou're best bet is to react to the 3rd parties in a slightly surprised, slightly concerned way: Your mother gifted you a sweater in a colour that you never wear and in the wrong size for your body. You were absolutely polite and tactful in asking for a receipt. You are not expecting a replacement gift. As far as you were aware, this \"issue\" was resolved on Christmas Day with your mother deciding to keep the sweater for herself. You're quite surprised to hear that your mother is upset, and disappointed that she has been complaining to relatives rather than speak to you about it. You really don't understand what all the drama is about, and you're sorry they are getting sucked into it, and maybe next time they should politely disengage and tell your mother to talk to you directly. Whatever they do, they should be careful that they don't agree to pass a message to you, because (you know how she is...\\[wink\\]) that kind of things just tends to encourage your mother.\n\nDon't bare your real feelings to relatives, because lots of people are morons, who - if they figure out that you have plenty of reasons to justifiably be upset - will assume that you must have been acting on these feelings in a \"retaliatory\" way, intentionally hurting your mother's feelings.
