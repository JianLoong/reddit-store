If she did that to them they would have never spoken to her again. Round 2 of NC lasted about 2 years, cuz she wanted back in. I allowed LC  of varying degrees for years, but with incredibly firm boundaries. She tried a few things and again we had to rinse and repeat. She finally stopped when I explained she can either behave or we can go back to NC. During that time she also stopped getting co-dependent support for her bs after multiple people witnessed first hand how bad her behavior was. A lot of it stemmed solely from wanting drama and wanting people to think she's the parent of the year. Needless to say she was not.

My mom is very similar to OPs, but religious flavored.  If we didn't like what she likes, we were the problem--and we were doing it on purpose.  I learned all kinds of manipulative tricks to make my life bearable and eventually even fun--things like reframing arguments to give yourself the moral high ground and ignoring subtext to force the person to admit what they really want.  (Example--my mom was very into giving stuff to others to appear generous, so I would've reframed getting rid of the sweater: Mom, my friend saw that sweater you gave me and loved it; it reminded them of 'x' event in their life. I felt like God meant for them to have it.  Of course she would argue with me, but she can't argue that being generous is bad or doing what God wants is bad, so as long as I reply to every argument with a variation of the reframing, I win. Her: but I gave you that sweater, how can you give it up if you love me? Me: but friend needed it so much more than me; how can you ask me to be so selfish? Etc. Etc). Expert level is to pretend to be the narcissist and mirror their behavior back to them--next Christmas your mom gets a sweater you know she will hate, and if she doesn't like it, you will be devastated --you spent months choosing that for her, etc, etc. Warning: these techniques require you to know your mother very well; my mom is very into Christian giving, pick what values your mom has and use them against her.  Even the most narcissistic does not want to look like an obvious hypocrite in front of others, so especially use these techniques around non-family members, as narcissists usually consider family as extensions of themselves and don't mind being hypocritical to them as much. If you're less extroverted, you can also use Grey Rock techniques to 'fight' back in a more passive way. Also do not expect any of this to change her overall behavior, but eventually it should change her behavior with you specifically.

She did the same thing to my mother all her life and well into my adulthood when I just started asking cash for college and stopped accepting gifts from her at all.

As far as you were aware, this \"issue\" was resolved on Christmas Day with your mother deciding to keep the sweater for herself. You're quite surprised to hear that your mother is upset, and disappointed that she has been complaining to relatives rather than speak to you about it. You really don't understand what all the drama is about, and you're sorry they are getting sucked into it, and maybe next time they should politely disengage and tell your mother to talk to you directly.

The problem was that she never picked things I like, and I felt like an asshole trying to pretend that I liked those things, but now she has a long list of items to choose from. She still gets to do a little shopping and she what she likes best off the list I have given her but, they are already things she know I will love and in the size I want them in.

Bonus points if you can make it not your fault\n\n2) Give her a taste of her own medicine. Buy her a hideous clothing gift in return that is not her style at all and you know she\u2019ll hate.

It\u2019s just petty and not worth you being upset over. \n\n4) Suck it up and wear the clothes when you visit her and are preferably not leaving the house. It\u2019s hugely common for family to buy each other clothes (at least in my country). I\u2019m sure that 80% of people don\u2019t like the gift, it\u2019s also why/how ugly Christmas jumper day was invented - because so many people received ugly sweaters as genuine heartfelt gifts. Plenty just wear it to make their relative happy. My dad got a shirt every single Christmas and birthday from his mom and he wore them the next day without fail or comment. \n\n5) I personally am not as self sacrificing, so I\u2019d be tempted to just sit down with your mom and say that you know she loves buying you clothes and that\u2019s how she shows her love, but these just a aren\u2019t you. The clothes she picks look amazing on her and really reflect her personality etc, but they\u2019re just not your style/cup of tea.

Her heart would be in the right place but it just wouldn\u2019t be your mom. \n\n6) reinforce it with effusive thanks and gushing when she does buy you vouchers from H&M. Show her the items of clothing you bought with the vouchers and say how much you love it and that you always think of her when you wear it. \n\nHopefully what she\u2019s after is feeling like she bought you something you love rather than making you her clone. If so, seeing what you bought with it could help her feel that way. Some people don\u2019t like giving vouchers and cash as gifts because they think it\u2019s impersonal and not what a gift should be.

And if others asked that's  a valid excuse for it too. I'm sure that was also part of it too besides the ugliness of it. Did she not know your size how did she get your size that completely wrong or is that her size she gifted you ? If so I can see a twist to it even though I'm sure it may not actually be anything but if it's her size did she secretly hope you didn't like it so she could keep it because she may secretly love the sweater?", "NTA\n\nLike, I get the feeling of being exciting about gift giving and the idea of \"it's the thought that counts\" but that thought has to take your feelings into account. It's one thing to be wrong or make a mistake, but you've made it abundantly clear more than once and had a very generous compromise in place. This is definitely a feeling of betrayal. Since it was working for so long, but her feelings of personal satisfaction overrode the actual point. Getting a gift for YOU. It feels like you're not a person, but a warm body that's an excuse to go shopping and store the goods elsewhere so they can get more stuff. \n\nI have an aunt similar to this in that she had boys and I guess her side also only has boys. My sister and I were her only girls. So she was very excited to buy gifts for girls. Fine, I guess, but I don't like traditional girly things. I wear necklaces but ONLY sentimentally (as in I haven't taken my current one off in 10+ years because it was from a family friend who died, but I might finally change it out to wear my wedding/engagement ring), I don't wear rings or bracelets since I don't like wearing things on my hands, not even my Aggie class ring which is a big deal for those who went to that school. I do sometimes wear earrings, but quirky ones like a pair I have that are bloody chainsaws and the like. No makeup, no lotions, no fancy bath stuff, candles, etc. Not my thing. I always got a variety of all of the above until the family changed to a much better White Elephant deal.

I have an observation to make though: throughout your post and all your replies, you keep making excuses for your mom's behavior. \"That's the only haircut she knew how to do\" for example. Stop doing that. You don't need to bend over backwards to explain to us that your mom isn't a bad person. Her actions surrounding presents and your appearance make her an asshole, not you.

I'm not going to tell you she's some abusive narcissist you should go no contact with. I'm sure she loves you very much. *But that doesn't make her actions ok*.  And you don't have to accept her bad behavior just because you love her. \n\nMy recommendation to you is to first not put too much emotional weight towards her gifts. Certainly remind her of your preferences before the gift-giving event, but one she gives you a thing, just say thanks and then donate it. If she asks you about it, claim ignorance \"huh, I don't know where it went mom, it's a mystery!\" Sure, it would be nice to get something you actually want, but I feel like this is a battle you are probably never going to \"win\" with her and the best way to handle it is to not play at all.\n\nI also really think it's time you saw a professional, non-religious therapist to help you work through your feelings towards your mom and how to handle your relationship with her in a way that helps you maintain boundaries.

I would really like to know how you are feeling about that, because I didn't mean to hurt you at all, and I am really sorry that I did. For me and from my perspective on that, I really did just want an h&m gift card because i know that I can be a bit pickier with the clothes that I wear and I do have a very different style than you, and I promise that it wasn't personal at all, and the fact that you saw something that you loved so much and thought of me, it was still greatly appreciated, I promise it was, but it really just wasn't my style at all, and part of what I love about the gift cards in place of actual clothing is that part of the gift includes getting to go out and make another memory with you shopping together, that is a big part of that gift for me. I LOVE so much that you thought of me in that moment, and I am really sorry that you were hurt by my reaction to it, I just wanted to be as open as possible with you so that we could prevent any feelings of me being ungrateful or you being hurt, but I guess I missed the mark, it wasn't my intention at all and I am sorry. Maybe next time we go shopping together I can show you things that are more my style, or if you DO plan to get me clothes, I know it ruins the surprise but maybe you could run it by me first just to be on the safe side. Your style looks WONDERFUL on you, it's just not a style that feels like it matches me. How are you feeling about this situation? I would love to hear how it was from your perspective so I can know your feelings a bit better so that we can come up with an understanding about it, I really don't ever want to upset you this much over something like this\"\n\nIdk something like that, maybe less winded than that LOL idk i am HUGE on making sure thkngs are communicated effectively to make sure there are as few misunderstandings as possible.", "In my opinion, when you are given a gift you don't like, you should still be polite.

We/ I have tried to make it a good experience for 3 or 4 gift giving occasions. But I guess she preferred to shop alone. She hinted at it very loudly. And she would argue over every piece of clothing I wanted to choose for myself. And my taste is not very controversial, I think. That's why I switched to the gift card idea as another compromise.\nShe didn't like it but accepted it because I had good arguments for it.\nNow I can only assume, but I think maybe me finding my footing alone as an adult in a different city and developing boundaries might have caused this as kind of counter reaction. But that's just me guessing.", "She asked me specifically what gift I wanted for christmas. \nI replied with \"A gift card, please!\" \nI didn't dictate it by force. I was asked.\nAnd I'd rather had no gift than that.\nI didn't even know \"we\" had a feud until I heard about it months later. \nBut anyways. I respect your perspective.", ">But I don't understand what introversion or extroversion has to do with how one chooses to dress.\n\nIt might be lost in translation kind of thing. With my sometimes limited english vocabulary it was a way to express my more muted style of clothing. Because I hate to catch attention with my clothes. Because I am an introvert. That's all. Sorry that I got it wrong. I didn't mean to define anything by it.", "Sorry...?  XD", "Ah, sorry, I was kind of getting a religious vibe from you, specifically when you apologized for saying \"boobs\", which is not a bad word at all unless you're very religious and think any mention of body parts not typically shown uncovered in public is scandalous.", "It very well could be. I know that as a parent, I look and notice what my kids like now. They just want money or a gift card. It makes me sad because I love all things Christmas, including trying to find things my kids would like. But I also understand they are adults and prefer money/ gift cards. So it does after you explained what your mom is like, I can see this as her doing stuff like this for attention because you set boundaries for her.", "It's fine. I understood what you were trying to convey. You like what you like, and that's okay.", "Naah! I'm just terrified to say the wrong words in a language that isn't mine. People get so easily offended over some words for bodyparts. And every english speaking country has it's own english curse barrier XD I didn't want to upset anyone. Thank you for explaining.", "I can understand that it can be like the end of an era for parents and hard to transition. Even I as a young adult think christmas with little children, their laughter, their wonder over Santa, has a big magic to it. It's a way to let your inner child out to play. :)  Gift cards might not feel very ceremonial, but life is sooo expensive and that extra money means the world. It's not meant as an affront. I think it's sad that so many can't see that part. (You excluded, of course).\nMy siblings and friends and I settled on gifted experiences together. Going to the movies, mini golf, climbing. The likes. It's our way to make life bigger instead of gathering stuff.\n\n(My mom didn't like that option either, just to add that)", "As I said in other replies. The gift giving is not the end of her expectation. She expects me to wear her gifts often. In public. And she inquired about it asking others in our family in the past. \nWhich narrows my options down.", "You didn\u2019t know that because most sane people don\u2019t behave like that lol", "I\u2019m totally picturing a goth skater dress (3 sizes too small) with skull and cross bone knee highs. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yep, I wish I would have thought about gift experiences when mine were little. I think they would have loved that more than gifts.", "You\u2019re right. It\u2019s twisted.", "Betsey Johnson's stuff! Totally Goth cute chic!", "Maybe. But unpacking boxes and having something to touch and build or play is also an awesome experience for little kids. I loved my lego space shuttle way back when. Build and rebuild it several times. I guess both ways have their valid pros and cons.", "I meant like a Disney trip or something big with a couple of little presents", "Oooh! That really sounds awesome! \nMaybe for the grandkids someday:)\nIf your adult kids are no longer interested in such a thing.\n(Frankly, I would love to go even as an adult:))", "We are talking about going on a family cruise soon! They are excited about that. .", "I'm exited for you. :D That sounds like so much fun. And I heard someone once say cuise ships are to Disneyland what hardware and garden centers are to Toys-R-Us. Adult ball pits :D.\nI hope you have the best time with your family there."]}
