We own a spot in there too.\n\nThe rules are simple: if you OWN, (must be the owner, doesn't work if you're renting) you have the RIGHT to have ONE parking spot IF there are any without owner. Since it's fewer parking spots than apartments, not everyone who has an apartment and a car has a spot. However, we are among the lucky ones. All the spots require a monthly fee to be kept. We always pay our fee to benefit from the parking spot.\n\nMy spot is number 31. Next to me it's number 30 that belongs to my neighbor, a woman that has owned her spot before mine. I know when this woman goes to work and when she returns and naturally, I know her car. A couple days ago when she was at work, I had my car pulled in my spot and opened the doors to her side. I was struggling a little with the child seat, strapping my kids in and the bags I had, so I was taking some space of her spot too.\n\nCue entitled man that I've never seen before. He pulls up in the parking and wants to park on spot 30. I wave at him that I won't be leaving anytime soon (the parking has only one narrow alley where cars drive so having a car stopping to wait essentially blocks it). He got down and started to shame me and tell me it's not normal to take up a parking spot with my kid stuff, that it's already an overcrowded city (he's right tho) and that it's his right to park there where I \"illegally\" deposited my kid stuff.\n\nI got mad and told him that first of all, I didn't deposit anything, just temporarily put down some things next to my car out of the DRIVING WAY and then I asked him if he knew Beatrice (neighbor's name) and she said no and he doesn't care who she is, but he wants to park the car. I told him he should've cared since he wanted to park the car in HER PAID SPOT. I told him he doesn't have any given right to park here unless he pays for the spot or if Beatrice gave him permission and he can't ask me to move. I showed him the signs that say \"RESIDENCE PARKING\" and told him to get lost or I'll call the police for illegal parking.\n\nHe switched 180 and almost begged me to park his car there for five minutes until he goes to an ATM near there, but I refused and kept threatening with the police. Another car pulled up in the parking so I told him that he's blocking an access and he has to leave. He called me an AH. It got me thinking, for five minutes...
