You shouldn't have been put in the middle of this, but I understand that your dad may have felt like he didn't have any other resources.

Alcoholics only care about one thing.  When they can get their next drink.  There is absolutely nothing that you can do to help mom. You will be interviewed during the divorce proceeding about which parent you want to have custody of you.   That is, if you are still underage.  The choice is obvious.  Any further association with mom will ultimately lead to unhappiness for you, at the least.  If you have minor siblings that are near your age, they need to select dad for their custody, as well.  Your mom destroyed your relationship with her all by herself.   All you did was love her unconditionally.  Fortunately for you that your head finally overruled your heart and you clung to dad.", "Nta \n\nYour mum needs help but she might need to hit a few more lows before she\u2019s willing to seek it", "NTA. She ruined everything. You just told the truth. I hope your father gets custody and your mother gets treatment.", "NTA, but BOTH of your parents are.\n\nHoney, *none* of this is your fault.  Your father absolutely shouldn't have put this burden on you. That was totally unfair. He should have left her years ago and protected you and your brother from this. \n\nYour mother is an alcoholic, and it sounds like she's not a very nice person.  But understand that it isn't the alcohol that makes her say or do horrible things, that's just her.\n\nCan you look into an al anon meeting near you, or talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher or counselor about this?", "NTA. It's pretty hard to imagine that your dad didn't already know. In fact, it's obvious that he did, and he chose to stay with her despite it, possibly ignoring the fallout on you kids. Your telling him just made it too hard for him to ignore the obvious truth anymore.", "NTA. I hope for you and your brother's sake your dad follows through on it. I grew up with a father who went from functioning alcoholic to non-functioning alcoholic and now still has issues with alcohol. And a mom that enabled him. Children are not responsible for their parents and should never be made to feel responsible for them. Best of luck.", "NTA. Her issues need to be addressed with a doctor or someone qualified to help her asap.", "NTA", "NTA your mom is the one that ruined her marriage. An important part of marriage is trust and she broke it multiple times in ways that include cheating and putting you and your sibling in harms way.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you are in this situation. Neither of your parents are fulfilling their parental roles. Your dad\u2019s leaving is just getting himself out of the situation and leaving you to deal with it. He should be supporting her seeking treatment and making sure you are OK, not asking you to narc on her. There\u2019s a global organisation called Al-Anon whose purpose is to help the families and friends of alcoholics. They have a related group called Alateen which is designed to help teenagers who are living with alcoholics. I can only suggest you contact them.", "You\u2019re not the villain. Your mom needs help. The fact that she\u2019s so upset with you proves that (among many many other things in your post). NTA.", "First of all, your dad has had plenty of reasons to leave. I think he was gathering courage, but he would eventually, look how poorly he has been treated. \n\nYou didn't ruined anything. Your mom and her addiction did. Even if she sees it as relaxing, it isn't, and I think this may be an opportunity for her to see it. If not, honestly between us, a long term relationship with an addicted probably can't happen. NTA. You did it right. Your dad deserves happiness, he doesn't have to be around to see your mom destroying herself and neither should you or your brother.", "NTA, addicts count on people keeping secrets, you did the right thing. Your Dad should take you with him.", "NTA\n\nSo sorry you are having to deal with this. There is nothing you can do for her. She has to \"want to\" change and get help which generally only happens when someone hits \"rock bottom\". Hopefully you and you brother can steer clear of her until that day comes. It does sound like your Dad has finally reached his end with her which will be a good thing for you and your brother as that may facilitate rock bottom faster.", "NTA. He was going to catch her drunk sooner or later, your telling him only moved up his timeline, it didn't make up his mind. The whole time your mother has been an alcoholic, she's hasn't had to experience the consequences of her addiction. Now that she is, instead of taking responsibility for herself, she made you her scapegoat. The only one to blame here is your mother.\n\nI'm sorry you have to live through this.", "NTA! As a recovering alcoholic (22 years sober) married to a recovering alcoholic (1.5 years sober) you did the right thing. You shouldn't have had to be in the middle of it, and I'm very sorry for that. But your father has the right to know, and has the right to decide what he wants to do about it.\n\nYour mom is very sick. There can be a lot of reasons someone starts to drink, but over time, they become physically and mentally addicted to alcohol, and then drinking takes over any decisions they might make. I know, for myself, that I *couldn't* stop until I got professional and peer based support. And I would do anything so I could keep drinking - including lying to anyone and everyone I loved. My husband was the same way. He would lie to me about his drinking, even when it was very obvious. He lied to me so often that I started to doubt evidence that was right in front of my face...an alcoholic cares more about alcohol than they do anything else in the world.\n\nAnd that, I suspect, is where your dad found himself. Your mother was *never* going to be honest to him about her drinking, so he turned to one person he could trust to tell him the truth - you. I'm sorry he put you in the middle of this all, but I can understand why he did.\n\nAs hard as this is going to be, as painful as this will be for everyone involved, this divorce may be the best option for you all. Your dad has the right to spend his life with someone who doesn't destroy themselves and lie to him. You deserve to feel safe at home, period.\n\nAnd your mother needs to spend some time with the consequences of her actions. This isn't a punishment for her (although she may believe it is). This is a very natural result of alcoholism. Trying to shield her from consequences only makes things worse, because until we get enough consequences, we alcoholics rarely (never) find a reason strong enough for us to seek help. I hope your mother is able to look for the help she desperately needs...\n\nMy heart goes out to you. There's nothing comfortable about what you are going through right now. You and your dad may want to look into Al-Anon & Al-Ateen, which are support groups for people who have an alcoholic family member. It's a lot of people who have been doing with the same things you are, and they can be REALLY helpful.", "NTA. She isn't just drinking. She is drinking and cheating and emotionally abusing her children. \n\nYou didn't ruin her relationship with her. She did it. She knows this too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your relationship with your mother cannot recover properly until she has reached her rock bottom and starts to take responsibility.", "NTA\n\nI hope she gets the help she needs, but your dad is better off without her\n\nI know alcohol affects people's behaviour etc but it's never an excuse to cheat... your dad did well to forgive her, but he needs to escape and heal, and she needs professional help so she can have a healthy relationship with the rest of you", "NTA and please don't feel guilty/responsible. This marriage is ending because of what is known as \"Death by a thousand paper cuts\" - you telling your dad was simply one of those tiny paper cuts, but trust me, your dad had already endured the other 999. I hope your mom eventually gets the help she needs and that your dad can keep you and your brother safe in these coming difficult times. I know you said that you don't want them to get divorced, but it is probably going to be better in the long run, especially for your dad's emotional well-being.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is the one who ruined things by refusing to address her addiction and letting it consume her. \"Relaxing\" doesn't mean scaring and abandoning her kids and cheating on her husband.\n\nIt is absolutely not your fault.  When she says those things, it's her desire to not blame herself talking.  To not have to face the truth.\n\nRight now, you should focus on doing what's right for you and your brother's mental health.  No matter how much you may want to help your mom, there's nothing you can do until she's willing to change and that has to come from her.  It sucks, but sometimes an addict needs to hit rock bottom before they are willing to admit something is wrong.  Until then, they will blame it on whatever they can.  Anything to keep justifying the addiction.", "NTA, it's not right that your dad put you in the middle of this, and of course it's not right that your mom is favouring getting shitfaced over being a parent.", "NTA. As a child of an alcoholic, let me tell you that you did the right thing.\n\nMom won\u2019t change until she admits to a problem. If that means breaking up the family, so be it. You and your brother deserve - no, need - better.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for you & for your brother that both of you had to endure all of this.", "This!!", "Yeah. Mom couldn't go one day without drinking, dad set OP up to be the one to \"catch\" her.  Dad's the AH, mom needs help but is also an AH.  OPs obviously NTA.", "AGREE! There is no excuse to put your children in the middle of your own affairs. It is also horrible that he stayed with her as long as he did and continually subjected you and your brother to her antics for most of your lives. \n\nThe damage he and your mother have both done is horrific. They are TA. You are NTA AT ALL. Get into therapy, which will help you a lot, and get away from this dynamic as soon as you are 18/able. Hopefully your brother is also close enough to 18 that he won\u2019t have to be a part of it much longer either.\n\nGet away from your mom and get her into rehab. Talk to your dad about how unfair it was to put you in the middle and letting all the blame come down on you. Hold your brother close and support each other through what is undoubtedly going to be a very difficult time.\n\nThey have been unfair to you. Don\u2019t be unfair to yourself.", "Part of me wonders if he was trying to justify staying with her and his red line was drinking in front of the kids.", "> Ask them about al anon\n\nAlso, OP, you might want to consider Alateen, which is similar to Al Anon but geared towards teens. It helped my friend out when she was your age.\n\nThey now even have meetings that happen over chat if you're uncomfortable physically attending a meeting.", "Doesn't sound like the first time she was drunk around the kids.  It's obviously a very complicated situation, way above my pay grade.  AH might be a little harsh, but they're definitely letting their kids down big time.", "Firstly, NTA.\n\nOP, the situation you are living with is awful. My mother is an alcoholic, and like you I have grown up watching her get blind drunk at home, make awful life choices but to everyone else she appears alright. \n\nIt's a heavy burden, but it's not one that should fall on the shoulders and mind of any child, ever.\n\nYou haven't done anything wrong. You need to remember she is in the wrong. Yes she has an addiction, but she also has a choice as to how that addiction will shape her life. She is allowing it to control her and is therefore allowing all of her awful behaviour. \n\nFrankly, your father should have stepped up a long time ago and made decisions to protect you and himself from her self-destructive behaviour. \n\nYou're 17 now, so hopefully this will mean you won't have too much longer at home and you might be going off to uni. Take the space and time. Put boundaries in place. It took me far too long to do that myself, and I am now completely no contact but my life is so much better for it. Also remember alcoholism in a parent greatly increases the likelihood of you having an issue with alcohol yourself. Be aware of that, and make the choices you need. \n\nIn my experience alcoholics are also great narcissists. She will make you feel guilty because she cannot own her own responsibility for the chaos around her. This is not your fault and you need to remember that.", "You beautiful child let me tell you something as a child of a alcoholic, you did NOTHING wrong. She will continue to place blame everywhere but where it belongs. She\u2019s been enabled by your father for so long that she believes it\u2019s her right to use alcohol to relax. You are not an asshole, you deserve so much better than this.", "NTA \n\nDaughter of a \u201cfunctioning alcoholic\u201d single-parent mother from a family of semi and non-functioning alcoholics here. \n\nGet out and never look back. Until and unless they have no choice, people like your (and my) mother will never admit to having a problem, much less get help. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you are going thru this. If you want to talk, please PM me. I wish you all the best.", "My mum is the exact same way, she has almost died a few times because she is also a diabetic. It\u2019s not your fault at all. Your mum has been enabled for too long and she hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom. And unless she faces consequences she probably won\u2019t change. She probably also has a lot of mental health issues. I know my mum does. Maybe see if your dad is willing to talk your mum in to getting some therapy to deal with her shit. Obviously she has to want to change but anyways good luck!", "NTA Op this is coming from someone whose mom is an alcoholic. Your mom will only get better when she wants to. Don\u2019t let anything she says to you keep you down. Definitely have your person to talk to when you need them. I have faith in you and wish you the best in growing up knowing that you weren\u2019t the cause of this.", "Nothing to add, perfectly stated and covered all the major points.\n\nOP you are NTA.   Please, please do not blame yourself for any of this and get therapy for yourself.  Talk to a school counseler if there are no other options.", "Mom needs help. That doesn't make her an AH", "It sounds harsh. But being an addict and being an AH aren't mutually exclusive. Anyone who has known or has been an addict knows it sorta comes with the territory... I did say she needs help as well...", "A lot of addicts tend to act like ah\u2019s. Yes it\u2019s often because of their disease but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier on the people who care about them. The mom does need help but without admitting to herself that she has a problem (which OP says she doesn\u2019t see a problem) then there\u2019s not much that can be done to help when you yourself are at the end of your rope.", "NTA. You are not responsible for taking care of your mother, dealing with her issues, or ratting her out. I'm sorry your dad put you in that position, it was wrong of him. \n\nYour mother is blaming you and anyone else she can for her problems because she can't handle how she feels about herself - she needs help, but that's a journey she'll have to walk on her own. Addiction is the kind of disease you have to want to recover from. Until she decides she's unhappy with how she's living, she won't change and no amount of force will make her. Let your dad deal with it. \n\nDo you have anyone you can go to for support or to talk to about this stuff? Like a school counsellor or another family member? What about something like Al Anon (a group for family members and loved ones of alcoholics)? \n\nGrowing up with an addict parent is tramatic. I can't imagine either of you parents even know how to support you emotionally through this. \n\nI'll say it again: you are not responsible for your parents. They should be taking care of you. I'm sorry they aren't.", "I personally see drinking as a way to \u2018relax\u2019 as well. But there\u2019s a limit. I drink once a week to distress. I drink from 7pm till the bottle (375ml) is empty and then I go to bed. NTA at all. If she didn\u2019t want to get caught drinking she shouldn\u2019t have been drinking \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, I also grew up with an alcoholic mother, which also eventually caused my parents to divorce.\n\nI know it's really hard to be in your situation and I'm sorry.\n\nIt won't get better until your mother accepts she has a problem and actually works on fixing it. Even then, it won't be immediate, the same things don't work for the same people. Don't be too mad at her, recognize she is suffering from a sickness and isn't doing this out of malice.\n\nWhat eventually helped in our case was Alcoholics Anonymous. They have some weird religious tones I'm not super comfortable with, but they gave me my mom back, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\n\nKnow there is hope even if your parents split. Both my mom and my dad are in new relationships now that are healthier than theirs was. They're both happy and I have a good relationship with both of them.", "NTA /you didn\u2019t ruin anything. your mom did, she just can\u2019t blame herself so she blames you instead", "NTA and you should try to live with your Dad. That is not a healthy environment for you.", "NTA. Your mom needs help. Unfortunately alcohol abuse has destroyed many marriages and living with an alcoholic is terrible. Keep your spirits up.", "NTA \n\nBoth of your parents are a*****es though. \n\nYour Dad shouldn\u2019t have YOU snitching on your mum. He should be an adult and work on their plan!\n\nYou\u2019re a kid. You just want o love both parents.", "NTA your dad shouldn't have put you in the middle however your mom ruined her own damn relationship. sounds like more than one.", "Yes, and part of the disease is denial of the problem", "Unfortunately you can\u2019t force people to accept that there\u2019s a problem. I\u2019ve known many people who\u2019ve struggled with addiction. They won\u2019t change until they are ready to. However no one should have to put up with their mistreatment simply for that reason.", "Please don't feel bad. You did nothing wrong. And you should never have been stuck in the middle of such an adult problem.  I'm also fairly certain that your dad knew; he was just waiting for his moment to go. It was so very wrong of him to put that on you\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Please don\u2019t ever doubt that. Addiction is a disease. A horrible, destructive disease. You got yourself and your brother out of a destructive situation. Hopefully, your mother can get the help she needs. \n\nThat being said, I am very sorry your dad put that on you. He crossed a major line there. He knew she had a problem and should have removed you two a while ago. It was not fair of him to ask you to \u201ctattle.\u201d\n\nBest wishes to you, OP.", "i completely understand. just because she has a job and somewhat functions doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a problem.", "thank you for your concern! i\u2019ve been staying with my grandparents and have a therapist i see regularly and trust.", "She's blaming her child for saying true things. She's an AH. Your substance abuse problems are not exculpatory for your behavior.", "You have an obligation as a parent to overcome that problem and are an AH if you don't. Want to be an addict that doesn't admit it? Don't have kids.", "ESH.  You shouldn\u2019t have ratted out your mom.  Your mom is a drunk.  Your father knows she\u2019s a drunk and should have asked you to confirm she was drinking.  You should go to a support group for the children or family mentor alcoholics.  Alanon is one such group.", "> You shouldn\u2019t have ratted out your mom. \n\nWhy should a kid not report that their parent is always under the influence? Did you want her to stay in the abusive situation forever?", "NTA. Beautifully said."]}
