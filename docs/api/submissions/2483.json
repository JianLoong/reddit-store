So I (34M) have a 9 year old son. His mother is not involved in his life at all. I\u2019ll explain as I think that is needed for the judgement. \n\nWhen I was 25 I was married to Diana (35F). A few years in she started turning into a totally different person. Angry, depressed, drinking a lot, shady friends. She started leaving the house late at night, not saying where she was going. She got into multiple fights in public places when we were out. She started flirting with dudes in front of me trying to piss me off. Her behavior got bizarre. I attributed it to her family life (her mom is bum and she never knew her dad). I assumed it was attention seeking behavior and she\u2019d grow out of it. Then she quit her job and stopped giving me physical attention. I filed for divorce whenever our son was 3.\n\nDiana immediately started dating this dude while we were going thru the divorce. I got a very iffy feeling on him so I ran his record. Turns out he had been charged with a crime and he wasn\u2019t allowed around kids. Diana had brought our son multiple times around him. I was furious and so were my parents. My dad is a lawyer so I ended up using him to fight for sole custody. Diana in front of the judge admitted to bringing our son around him. Refused a mental health screening or drug test. Said she didn\u2019t plan on breaking up with this guy. We got a favorable judge and I was granted full custody. No visitation for Diana. She didn\u2019t even act like she cared. \n\nI didn\u2019t hear from her for the last 5 years. Only a couple text from her mom asking to see my son. Never responded. But guess who started showing back up this year. First it was at my sons baseball game. I noticed her across the field. And she looked like she was trying to get my sons attention after the game. I was able to get my son in the car and told her to leave us alone. She said she wanted to talk. I said she can contact my lawyer but to not speak to my son, GF or me. So my GF and me have been together 3 years. She\u2019s basically my sons step mom without the title. They are very close and we don\u2019t intend to bring up the mother situation that much.\n\nSo shit went crazy this weekend. So I\u2019m at home, my GF comes in the house all upset. Saying that my ex wife and her mom are in the driveway. And she was scared. I looked outside and my ex wife and her mom were parked in front of the mailbox and had presents in their hands. I didn\u2019t want to deal with them. So I called the police. I watched as the cops showed up and told them to leave. I\u2019ve now pressed chargers for harassment against her and her mom. Some of our mutual friends are calling me the AH here. Because all Diana wanted according to them was to give my son a birthday gift (my sons birthday was this Monday) and that\u2019s why they were there. I said that didn\u2019t matter and they should have no shown up to my house at all. Regardless of the reason. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re never the AH for protecting your children.\n\nAll that being said, I think it would behoove you to get in touch with your ex and meet at a mutual spot so you two can talk. Look, there are zero excuses for being a sh** mom and putting your children in danger. HOWEVER, people do change. I\u2019m one of them. I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic and, while I never put my son in danger nor did I abandon him, I did some pretty crappy things that I regret. But I have changed. I\u2019m a way more present mom, I work the AA program, I do charity work, I\u2019m happier and more balanced\u2026 I\u2019m incredibly lucky and grateful that my family didn\u2019t give up on me and I\u2019m back on their good graces. So people CAN change and they deserve to have the ability to prove themselves.\n\nBut she has to PROVE she\u2019s changed. Not just provide lip service. She needs to show she\u2019s actively in a recovery program, that she\u2019s in counseling, that she\u2019s no longer dating that dude, etc. I would just meet with her and let her know that these are your boundaries/parameters and she can\u2019t just force herself in her son\u2019s life. She has to prove she\u2019s worthy and put in the work to show it. \n\nBut that\u2019s entirely up to you.

I need more info. You didn't address the whole \"stay away\" legal issue.

She needs to go away.", "NTA. \n\nShe shouldn't just show up at your home unannounced.   Period.", "NTA you told her to talk to the lawyer. She balked at that, you did not.

Well he won't be biased at all, will he? \n\nYou've blanked her mum when she's reached out, you've blocked your ex from contacting you but now saying she can contact you through your dad, all without hearing anything about her situation. She may have dealt with all of her issues, but you won't know, because she can't afford a lawyer. \n\nI get that you're angry with her, and rightfully so, but you're not giving her a chance to explain how her life is now,  which might be why she feels she has to take drastic measures. You owe it to your son to at least hear her out, don't be the dad who gets put on nc when his kid hits 18 and finds out dad prevented a chance of a relationship on whatever level with his mum. \n\nIf she has sorted her life out, you can set the rules of contact.

Her visitation rights were taken away.", "No visitation rights were granted to her do to being with a man who couldn\u2019t be around kids..", "She is indeed still his mother, which is why she should put the child's needs first just as much as OP does. Coming back into his life without warning, without working up to it, would not be good for the kid. It doesn't matter if there is an OOP or anything else. She lost visitation rights, she'll need to go through the proper channels if she wants any rights back.   \nThe OP has every right to tell her to stay away, unless she challenges it in court and wins.", "She is not his mother. She is an egg donor.  She left her son and didn\u2019t look back.  F her.", "How is it not realistic?! It\u2019s the legal way to go about things to continue to protect the child. She hasn\u2019t been motivated for the 5 years she hasn\u2019t been around, she can surely wait a bit longer to go through the proper channels.", "Actually it's the best way to determine how \"motivated\" this mother is. A mother who is serious about getting back in their child's life will take the direction and point of contact given and work from there.", "I'm just going to say that if the genders were reversed here, I highly doubt people would have this opinion.", "A motivated mother would agree to contact a lawyer, and and undergo the processes to show she could be trusted back in the life of her child especially if there's a history of mental health. A motivated mother would put the wellbeing of their child above their own desire to be a maternal figure.", "That\u2019s why they make lawyers! He told her to contact his lawyer when she showed up at the baseball game. She choose not to do that and then showed up at his home. \n\nGoing through proper legal channels is the only way to do this and get it done without issues. A judge will determine if she is fit to see the kid.", "Called a lawyer and communication through them.", "What? She had her chance to explain, and she explicitly stated she was staying with scary dude over having custody of her own son. \"Troubled\" is \"I'm super depressed and burnt out. Take our son for a week so I can regroup\". She left a 4 yearold and didn't communicate with him for 5 years. For over half this kid's life, SHE WASN'T THERE. There's not two sides to this thing.", "She knowingly and deliberately brought their son around a man who was not allowed near children because of past criminal behavior. GTFO.", "And my mother will technically always be mine! Doesn\u2019t make her less of a shitty person for checking out on motherhood.\n\nBut there is no harm at all in taking the precautions to go through the PROPER legal channels.", "But being a mother and a mom are two totally different things.. she gave birth yes, but she also ditched him.", "Bullshit. Blood means nothing. The man who impregnated my mother will die alone with nothing and nobody because he was a terrible father and none of his kids want anything to do with him. He's not my father and never will be.", "She can go to court to get them back. Did you not read my post?", "Also read my post the point is she can go back to court and request visitation rights if she has gotten her life back in order. If she has she has every right to see her son while I think it should be done slowly because I\u2019m sure the sun has had a lot of damage done by the dad against the mother. I get that he\u2019s angry but she wanted to be with a deadbeat isn\u2019t really illegal. It\u2019s the dad who wanted to take away our rights and so be it. But if she\u2019s gotten rid of that jerk and got help there should be no reason she can\u2019t start getting in touch with her son again that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying", "[removed]", "His strategy is short sited. \n\nOn the scary end of the spectrum, if the mother is unstable he is inviting a volatile situation that could result in an event that truly endangers the child such as kidnapping or something else scary. \n\nBest case aside from something genuinely scary, if the mother has gotten her life together and has a good case to legally be back in the child's life, his aggressive behavior now could lead to her being more vindictive in fighting for more custody and a generally worse situation for the father. Custody battles notoriously favor the mother, and his actions now could lead her to be out for blood if she's no longer with that guy and can make an argument she has a stable home now.\n\n>She hasn\u2019t been motivated for the 5 years she hasn\u2019t been around\n\nPlenty of parents are out of their kids life for multiple years only to suddenly become very, very motivated. This is not uncommon.", "So in five years she hasn\u2019t changed? She hasn\u2019t ditch the jerk? You can be mad all you want but if she has gotten her life back together she got a job she ditched the guy she\u2019s drug-free etc. why should she not have visitation again. It should go through the courts I agree but they just all well she doesn\u2019t deserve it cause she made mistakes we all make mistakes and that should not be held against her if she has made those mistakes right.", "That is all I\u2019m saying. Talk to her see how or if she changed and go from there", "So if she\u2019s changed it doesn\u2019t matter? If she\u2019s put her life together again she has no right ever to see her son again? That\u2019s harsh everybody goes through Rough periods she can\u2019t go to court prove to the court that she\u2019s got her life straightened out and she wants to see her son there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If we were all judged on past behaviors we would all probably be in jail", "And all I\u2019m saying is get a judge to deem her fit to be around the kid. But again, she didn\u2019t go through courts, she just showed up at the ex\u2019s house and that is not ok!", ">Also read my post the point is she can go back to court and request visitation rights if she has gotten her life back in order. \n\nSure, and once she does that, he should comply.  But she hasn't done that yet.", "She lost on court.  Didn\u2019t care. Walked away.  Chose a guy over her kid.  That does NOT make her a mother.  Sorry, not sorry.", "I\u2019m just saying, I was in the 9 year olds shoes at one point. I wish the parent that didn\u2019t check out on me protected me more and had my Absentee parent go through proper channels so I didn\u2019t end up hurt again.. which guess what, Absentee parent lasted 6 months and ditched me again.\n\nThis is all to protect that 9 year olds heart. \nDiana has the option to consult a lawyer and go about it that way. But you do not show up unannounced when the kid may not even remember her to begin with.", "I agree about the potential for escalation, such as kidnapping. I hope OP is reading this. I would strongly recommend taking plenty of steps to prevent this. Make sure the school he goes to has explicit instructions never to release your son to anyone else without contacting you right then and there and getting an okay. Take multiple pictures of your son, from all angles, in different positions, settings, and different light levels. Take videos of him moving, record his voice, and have a safe word for him, so that if someone calls his name and says they know him, they have to be able to produce a particular word that is only known to him and you, maybe your girlfriend, and if they cannot do this, he should act as though he is in danger and seek out a teacher, or a friend's parent, or someone nearby who can help and call the police. He should be taught that under no circumstances should he ever get into anyone's car or go with them unless you are there and the safe word is used.", "She can't just insert herself back into OP's life, showing up to events or at the end of his driveway. She needs to talk to his lawyer and he has every right to be protective and wary.\n\nThere's a difference between making a mistake and knowingly exposing your child to a p\\*do.", "I\u2019m saying to go through the courts.. not to just show up at her ex husbands to see the kid.\n\nShe needs to prove herself. I\u2019m not saying she will never see her kid again, but that\u2019s for a judge to determine.\n\nNo where did I say she never see him again.", "If she has changed it still may not matter. Sounds rough, but that's life. Once you give up on someone or something, sometimes that is the end. It may seem that after doing all the work to turn things around you may deserve all the gifts you had rejected back. But sometimes the consequences of your decisions are permanent.\n\nOP may well decide his kid is better off not reconnecting with someone unstable and liable to disappear again. Unless she can convince a judge that the facts underlying the earlier decision no longer apply, she way well just come to terms with the fact that this may have been an unfixable fuck-up. At least she still has her mom.", "People make mistakes. Some people work to make their life better.", "My sister had her ex stripped of his parental rights when he didn't show up for over three years. He was charged with abandonment. He has no legal rights to his son. OP can do the same for his son. Not everyone is meant to be a parent.", "To be clear, I am not advocating to easily let the mother back in the child's life by any stretch. I just wonder if something like a phone call or even coffee with the mother would better manage the situation by setting firm boundaries and make the mother less likely to do something crazy or be vindictive if she does pursue this legally. \n\n*Of course if that phone call/coffee is a shit show, then it's time to shut down all contact outside of the courts.*", "I recently read were a guy admitted to being a horrible father he drank used drugs gamble all the money left two boys. \n\nSo ten years later he went to rehab got a good job and a new girlfriend with a kid. He never got in touch with the boys during all that time\n\nHe finally decided to get back in touch with his kids slowly. Bought the a few gifts. Remember he deserted them for ten years. \n\nEveryone was was saying good for him he deserves another chance and praised him. \n\nSo for his girlfriends kids birthday he had only known for less than a year bought this kid a car. But he changed and everyone was oh that\u2019s so great etc. all I\u2019m saying is people change. But he still preferred a kid he has only known a year over his bios", "And some people abandon their children. Who deserve better.", "What she has done was not a mistake. It was a choice.\nAnd the kid well being comes before her wishes. If she is a real mother, she will understand that.", "And I\u2019m not advocating for her to never see her kid again. I\u2019ve just been the 9 year old and it\u2019s best to just go through the courts. I know it\u2019s expensive and not any fun, but for the sake of the boys heart and mental health, going through proper channels is best.\n\nThe divorce and all of that seems pretty ugly, meeting for coffee with heightened emotions sounds like a disaster to me when lawyers and whoever can ensure no outburst or anything looking like violence or a scene occurs.\n\nEdited to add: I truly think it would be protective of everyone involved so nothing can be misconstrued"]}
