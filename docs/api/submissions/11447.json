I\u2019m now 44f and happily childfree. When I was in my twenties, I had two best friends that I would usually hang out with separately. However, the three of us would sometimes hang out together. \n\nOne day, the three of us went to the mall. Both friends had children with us. Friend A had a toddler son. Friend B had an infant. Both needed car seats, obviously. Friend A was the driver and her toddler son had a cold. She arranged the seating so that she(A) and (B), sat in the front seats. She asked me to sit between the children to act as a \u201cbuffer\u201d (her actual word) between the kids, since I \u201cwasn\u2019t a mother or a child\u201d. \n\nNow, I probably would have sat there anyway, due to the arrangement of the car seats and whatnot. But I felt this was an incredibly fucked up concept that since I was not a mother or a child I was the best candidate to catch whatever germs might be present. I had a job and had to go there after the mall trip. Missing work meant not getting paid. There was no sick leave. \n\nI did not get sick, but was I wrong to feel a bit slighted by this? Is my health less important because I didn\u2019t have a kid?? I brought this up to friend A years later and she claimed it never happened and that she never said that, but it definitely did and those were her words. \n\nI have long since unfriended both of them for various reasons, but I let this situation slide for years. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

I'm sick and tired of people presuming the childfree are somehow less than - our time matters less, our health matters less, our passing should somehow even be measured in whether or not we have children or grandchildren.  How many times on this subreddit have we seen questions about the workplace involving the childfree having to accept a crappier shift or more work time because they chose not to have children? It's very frustrating.", "I wonder what people would say if this had happened yesterday. At the time, I might still have had kids. I am too old now.", "NTA. But for your own sake, you need to get over this. It is not healthy to continue to fixate on the past like this. Good luck with your mental health struggles OP.", "I guess because this was someone I considered a dear friend at one time. Also, I still have no kids and it messes with me that I am somehow considered less. I also unfriended friend A pretty recently. I brought this up to others right afterwards and they thought I was being callous for not thinking of the children.", "Her child was actually very mannerly. He was just sick. Even I know he wouldn\u2019t have messed with the baby. This was about the illness.", "Ok. I have no offspring. Is that better?", "I think about this when I\u2019m perfectly sober as well. There is a weird stigma against childfree women, and I\u2019m merely wondering if I experienced this.", "The kid had a cold. Most kids are fine when they have a cold, they're not sickly.

But you're more than likely going to encounter some people who don't understand that choice or who value their own role as parents so much that they'll expect everyone to cater to that.\n\nThis reminds me of those stories about coworkers asking for time off and believing they have more of a right to them than their childless coworkers.\n\nStill, their opinions are just that, opinions.", "Then you should have spoken up and said you weren\u2019t comfortable and would rather sit up front.

(i'm being facetious) \n\nOr: you are Childless, not Childfree. \n\nIts the difference between creating a culture that encourages the continuation of the human race or a culture that encourages the extinction of the human race... \n\nYou do have a right to live a lifestyle that will lead to Human extinction if everyone else followed it. You should understand that some people have different values from yours. Some people want Humanity to continue. \n\nHowever.... NTA because its just a difference of Values here. That's fine. people have differences and its understandable to be upset when other people put their values on us. (In this case, your friends valuing their reproductive lifestyle over your childfree one)", "Definitely not healthy to still be thinking about it. Yes it was a very weird thing to say and it was definitely part of the stigma against childfree women.

I can't believe i'm actually getting downvoted for a joke when i explicitly said in the first sentence that it was a joke... gosh I hate the internet. No fun at all... \n\nCant you sense the absurdity of the comment?", "If it's such a sore spot for you then why keep picking at it? You seem to be more than aware of the fact that what was said to you was wrong, and yet you came here and asked anyway. No amount of us telling you you're not the asshole will make you stop hurting over this. Try therapy.", "I mean idk what else to say.  You really just need to get over it.  Maybe don't be friends with those people anymore if its bothering you that much years later. You just seem so bitter about nothing.  Also what do you mean people are gaslighting you over it?\n\nEdit: also in response to your previous comment, yes. Just say you don't have kids. Saying that you are childfree implies to people (whether intentional or not) that you base your personality around not having kids. I blame reddit and the people on r/childfree for being unhinged and acting as if reproducing is unnatural and disgusting.", "Excuse me but being asked to be a germ buffer is not something you have to do and suck it up it is quite insulting and it's also a bit rude and just because o p is not a mom or even has children does not make her any less of a human being. And you are not supposed to suck up everything in the world gives you every rude comment that comes about.

Both of these friends were extremely close to me. Why not look back and wonder if my feelings were correct?", "The gaslighting bit was from friend A denying it ever happened.", "That is not what \u201cchildfree\u201d means. I work with children sometimes. They can be really cool and smart. They are just not one of my expenses. I am not equipped for that. I have enough trouble taking care of myself.", "Yeah, me too. Which is why I immediately recognized your obsession with the incident as maladaptive. Because I have been doing the same thing for the past decade of my life too and it sucks. You're caught in a negative feedback loop. You remember something that happened to you that made you upset, you remember the pain of people gaslighting you about it, you seek validation, it doesn't help. Repeat. Over and over and over again until you sound like a lunatic. \n\nStop feeding the cycle. Stop seeking external validation. The only person who can truly validate the pain you are feeling is yourself. Your brain won't let you accept that what happened to you sucked, so force it to. Repeat over and over again \"I did not deserve that, and those people were treating me poorly\" until it sticks. Get a pen and paper and write it down until your hand hurts. \"I am not worth less just because I don't want children and anyone who says otherwise is a jerk.\"\n\nThose are cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that have been keeping me alive for the past ten years.", "Okay now we have a little more context. I don't think your feelings were incorrect but this whole situation seems like such a small thing that it can not be healthy to be dwelling on it for years.  Again, it's just something to move past. You can tear yourself apart trying to look too deeply into the meaning behind people words, especially when it was a passing comment made years ago.  I can all but guarantee they didn't think you would take such offense to this comment and they probably never thought about it again. \n\nBut to be fair, you mentioned being gaslit about this, so we really some more context as to what you meant by that", "\"Why not look back and wonder if my feelings were correct?\"\n\nBecause that's a maladaptive coping mechanism. The more you look back the more you will doubt yourself. Deep down you do know that the way you were treated that day was not right, but you don't trust yourself because nobody else trusted you either. Start trusting yourself.", "I don't think we are going to come to a conclusion on this, but do you not see how weird it is to say \"they are just not one of my expenses\"?  Saying that gives the impression that you don't think of children as people. I don't think you are trying to come off this way but the words you use make it seem as if you dislike children in general, which influences my perception and the credibility of everything in your original post.", "What is wrong about reaching out? Yes, I\u2019m still hurt about this. I haven\u2019t really talked about it. I just wanted an option on what happened. I don\u2019t need psychoanalysis from strangers. I have two therapists and a psychiatrist due to other issues.", "Well. I\u2019m a little nuts. I struggle with some things. Hence, this post.", "I mean that they are not something I need to consider with my time and finances. Of course I think they are people. I used to be one.", "Yeah I think maybe that has something to do with the fact that you're still re-traumatizing yourself over something that happened two decades ago but yeah alright"]}
