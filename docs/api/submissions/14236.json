I would talk to the landlord because there is probably something in the lease restricting long term guests.", "NTA. They sound like a nightmare to deal with. Your lease probably has a clause about how long guests can stay. Bring that into play if necessary.

It isn\u2019t odd to not want someone you don\u2019t know, makes you uncomfortable, and eats your food to not be staying there. Your roommate claiming this is none of your business needs to realize what is living in your shared living room is your business! If she lived on her own with no roommate then her having an unemployed friend living on her couch would be no one else\u2019s business. That isn\u2019t the case when she has a roommate. I think a conversation about how long she intends to let him stay is needed. Personally, if she doesn\u2019t have a timeframe then I\u2019d begin exploring getting out. Expecting you to live with someone that makes you uncomfortable and expecting you to help support their deadbeat friend is a bridge too far.", "NTA  \nBe at peace with yourself and buy some Febreze to spray on this strange fellow.", "NTA.

I don't care what his problem is and honestly neither should you because it has nothing to do with you. Check your lease and then go to your landlord. Otherwise I'd make him as uncomfortable as possible until he leaves but I'm petty. I'd have to thrown his shit in the street as soon as he has the audacity to lock me out of a bathroom hours I pay rent money to be able to access. You are being taken advantage of by your roommate and their friend. She wants him there so bad then he can stay in her room and she can buy all his food.", "NTA, but you need to speak to your landlord about this guy in your home.  Having him their is costing you distress and not only that who the hell has to leave their own house to use the bathroom. Either you break your lease with your landlord and leave your roommate with the responsibility or have him leave and her leave and get you a new room mate their is no other option here.  Cause at this point she has to to go.", "Report roommate to the landlord.", "I'd lay down the law to roommate as well, \"do not leave your guests here when you are not here.
