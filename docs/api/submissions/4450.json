How an adult handles coparenting with an ex while dating. \n\nBtw I\u2019m only saying this cuz he disinvited you once his ex wanted to come, he was fine with you being around his kids.", "NTA. He should have told his ex that he will have other guests/gf. Red flag.", "NTA. He's not putting his kids first, he's putting his *ex-wife* first. He's the one that decided that he couldn't have you both there at the same time, and the kids are already getting to spend the morning with her anyway. She invited herself to his house for the full day and he's rejecting you in order to accommodate her - if she wants to spend the full day, it should be on the condition that she can accept you being there and be civil about it. If she can't do that, well, she's seeing the kids in the morning and children of divorced parents usually have their time divided between the parents over Christmas", "NTA. There is not one viable reason that he can't have you there for Christmas. At least none that bode well for your relationship", "NTA. Time to say thanks, but goodbye. Your kids may come first, but you definitely come before the ex wife!", "NTA for how you feel.\nYou still have a few weeks before Christmas, book yourself something nice (like a flight and room at a nice resort) and go enjoy yourself.", "NTA. He just chose a last minute plan and his ex wife over his plans with you and his present life. He made no attempt to be civil, or to even compromise. On a holiday too. He is immature/selfish.", "NtA. He's not putting his children first, he's putting his ex first. Good for them, they get to pretend to be a family again. And now you know that even though he loves you, the mother of his children will always come first. Don't do this to yourself. Don't let him use \" the children\" as an excuse to hurt you or treat you like you're less than his ex.", "NTA\n\nWhy can't you both be there? You and bf have been together 8 months, that's a decent amount of time. Why does he think the only options are to uninvite one of you? If they're amicable like you said, you should be allowed to go as well. You're his partner now, package deal.\n\nWho do you think suggested to uninvite you? Bf, or his ex?", "I hate to say this\u2026 but he doesn\u2019t love you. At least, not enough.  This is a power play by the ex, especially as this is the first time in five years.  She is absolutely doing this to control him, and show you she comes first.\n\nI am glad you are already considering breaking up with him.  That tells me that you see it, too.  It\u2019s your decisions, but if you stay with him, just know that you will always be third best, if not lower. (Depending on the level of control his parents have over him).\n\nHoney, you deserve someone who puts you first (or first after his children, if he has any).\n\nNTA.", "NTA. He was very rude and out of order. He should have informed his ex that you were going to be there, and told HER not to come because \u201cit would be awkward\u201d. He made an interesting choice. Frankly I\u2019d be moving on if someone did this to me.", "He should choose you, of course. An ex is a forever an ex that lost the place right beside the (ex)partner. He is favoring her over you and you know it. NTA for being upset, he is an a hole though.", "Some things you can control and some things you can't honey. Make sure you do something nice for yourself on Christmas day xo", "Sorry but gently, YTA.  You're going to visit your kids on Christmas morning and open presents.  You have the opportunity to make some plans for the rest of the day.  Don't you have a Jewish friend?  A movie you want to see?  A book to read?  Your favorite takeout to order the day before and heat up?  A nice hotel to stay at and enjoy a fancy meal?  Or drive those five hours to your parents and stay overnight or for a few days and drive back or take a train or plane.  You're 39, learn to self-sooth already.  Your BF is a good guy who puts taking care of his kids and harmonious co-parenting first.  If you want to break up over this, feel free  but his actions make sense.  Your disappointment makes sense, but be a little resilient and cope and don't be miserable to him about it.  It's one day of the year.", "Info: Why would it be awkward for you to be there? And awkward for who? Did your bf tell/ask you or the  mother about the possible change of plans or did he simply pick a random action? \n\nIf your bf and the kids mother have broken up more than 5 years ago, they don't secretly carry feelings for one another, they are both adults who understand human relationships good enough to raise their kids \"together\" - there is not one good reason why not both you and the mother could be there.\n\nBut: Don't jump to \"malicious intend\" as a reason for someones actions where \"ignorance\" would do just as well.", "YTA, Christmas is obviously going to centre around his children.  Given his positive co-parenting relationship with his ex it only makes sense that her presence would take priority in order to maintain a good relationship and healthy environment for the kids.

Well, if he loves you, he would accept the discomfort. Usually kids don't care as long as there are presents and they can understand the concept of daddy's new gf if everybody is normal about it.

It\u2019s weird and seems immature that he wouldn\u2019t want you there, you\u2019re his partner who he loves and if anything he should want to introduce you to the mother of the children he\u2019s comfortable introducing you to. I would think the mother would also want to meet you as you\u2019re spending time with the kids. Weird all around imo, can definitely understand your hurt.", "NAH but if you can't understand why he isn't wrong, you might be in the wrong.\n\nHis kids need to be priority over you.  Full stop, end of sentence.  It sucks for you, and holidays alone are not fun.  Hopefully he can carve out some time to spend with you very close to the holidays, but even if he can't, this is the way it should be.
