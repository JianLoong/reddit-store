There were only about 7 people there. My friend is pregnant and keeping it, and I'm the only one out of this group who knows. She doesn't want to tell anyone in the group about her pregnancy for reasons that don't really matter.\n\nWe were having a pretty good time but I noticed that Jane had like 3 beers. It made me uncomfortable considering she's pregnant, but knowing she didn't want to tell any of these people, I waited until we had left the party and started to walk home before I brought it up.\n\nI told Jane she shouldn't be drinking while pregnant and it's really bad for the baby, and that I just wanted her and her child to remain safe. She told me it was none of my business and called me an asshole. I think I was a little bit pushy and insisted that it was the wrong thing to do. I said if I saw her do it again I'd bring it up no matter who was around, and I thought it was tasteless and extremely selfish to drink while pregnant. She was quiet for the rest of the walk and disappeared into her apartment without saying anything else. I walked the rest of the way home. It's been 4 days and we haven't talked.\n\nAITA?

I told Jane she should not be drinking while pregnant even though I\u2019m not her partner or her and I\u2019ve never been pregnant. I know Jane has had struggles with alcohol use and I understand it might be hard for her to quit, but if she\u2019s going to get knocked up, I believe she should do everything in her power not to drink.\n\n2. I honestly think I was too harsh.

I also have had children...  No matter how badly I wanted to, I didn't touch alcohol while pregnant because I refused to put my children thru what my brother went thru...  \n\nIf your so-called friend would put her own child thru a lifetime of suffering to satisfy her selfishness, she will do even worse to those around her...   Best to take responsibility for your own well-being and walk away...", "NTA. You are looking out for your friend and trying to save her and her baby from a lifetime of pain. The consequences of your friend's actions are non-trivial and may have already caused developmental issues in her baby. \n\nShe is not being mature about her situation. \n\nIt is reasonable for you to say you will not allow others around you to unknowingly participate in this recklessness. \n\nThat said, I don't think you can go on protecting people from their recklessness.

If she had only one drink I would say Y T A as the occasional one alcoholic beverage is likely not going to cause FAS, but 3 is def pushing it and not ok. You were right for bringing it up.", "NTA.  Supportive friends help. That said, it is abusive and irresponsible to willingly cause irreparable damage to a fetuses brain if said fetus was going to be carried to term. Perhaps she needs support of a professional nature.", "NTA, she literally made the choice to have sex, create life and to keep the baby but already reckless with her decisions as a parent. She\u2019s already willing to compromise a life she\u2019s responsible for and she obviously doesn\u2019t feel bad about it. You should always stand up for what you believe in and sometimes it costs you friends but good riddance, you\u2019ll find more.", "Hm, very tough situation but I will say NTA. I know women are gonna say it\u2019s their body and their choice, but\u2026if you\u2019re keeping the baby it\u2019s also the baby\u2019s body.

Some people get pregnant who are alcoholics or took the \u201ca little here and there is okay\u201d idea WAY too far or just don\u2019t care. None of them understand how horrible fetal alcohol syndrome is. It\u2019s very fair to be uncomfortable seeing anyone who you is pregnant drinking, and it\u2019s very appropriate to say something about it to a friend. \n\nAlcohol is decidedly less risky at the very beginning and end of pregnancy. But there\u2019s still absolutely no medically-agreed \u201csafe\u201d amount at *any* point after that umbilical cord attaches (around 5 weeks) because there are SO many unknowable factors about how your exact body processes alcohol and the exact development status of your specific pregnancy.", "NTA. I'm sure your friend is really struggling with the changes that come with pregnancy, the restrictions and recommendations, even if she wants the baby.

Time for Jane to grow up and realize that her actions don\u2019t just affect herself anymore.  You said what needed to be said.  She may not have wanted to hear it, but she has to start thinking about her baby.  She decided to keep it.  Now she has to start accepting responsibility for that choice.", "NTA but is she okay? Is it just that she's irresponsible or is she genuinely struggling with alcohol abuse? What she's doing isn't okay but if she struggles with drinking she likely needs additional support.", "NTA. It's time for her to face that her life is not fully her own anymore.", "NTA, you spoke privately, when you could have put her on blast publicly! She knows she\u2019s wrong that is why she has gone no contact.", "Well NTA, obviously.\nThe end goal here should be for her to stop drinking, right? So I would suggest you try to find out (kindly) what's stopping her from stopping to drink... It doesn't seem like a rational decision, assuming she knows the horrendous effects of alcohol on the fetus. So she either\na) Doesn't know enough about FAS\nb) Knows about it but is in deep denial\nc) Knows about it but cares more about her public appearance/feelings of shame/fear\nd) Doesn't believe scientific information \n\nIn case of d), well, have no clue what to do. But a-c can be worked on imo. Choose your angle based on your relationship with her. Remember: you're doing it for the child, but also for her, so no point in shaming/guilting her as you've tried that and it didn't work...time to work together and find out which support she really needs with her pregnancy.\n\nAnother angle you might choose: It's not only the baby you care about, but also her. Raising a child when you're so young is definitely a challenge, but her life will become indefinitely harder if her child develops FAS. So she's not doing herself a favour here either...in case that's a more convincing argument.\n\nAll the best!", "If that baby has alcohol in its system when it's born, she won't leave the hospital with it. Maybe you should tell her that. NTA, she needed to hear it.", "NTA, once you're pregnant and decide to keep the pregnancy, you can't be selfish any more. Its about the baby now, their health and well-being need to come first.\n\nAlso reading through these comments you can tell which ones care about their kids and which ones don't!", "NTA.  You protected her secret but talked to her straight.  She needs a come-to-Jesus moment.  Not drinking is a picnic compared to some of what she's going to deal with, and if she can do this now while she's growing this child *she chose to have*, in what other ways is she going to abuse it?  But no more protecting that secret.", "Huge NTA! Please save that childs life!!!!!! Tell everyone she knows that she is pregnant if that's what it takes. You will feel horrible the rest of your life if that baby got fetal alcohol syndrome when you could have helped stop it!", "NTA.  She's abusing her unborn child.", "NTA at all. You waited until a private moment to bring it up. \n\nIf it\u2019s out of ignorance you should do some research on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or other impacts of drinking while pregnant and share that with Jane.", "I will never forget being at a bar in my hometown the night before a holiday. There was a heavily pregnant woman dancing and getting down with her friends. All I thought was \u201cYou go, girl! Hope your water doesn\u2019t break on the dance floor!\u201d\nThe whole time I was thinking she was fabulous, with just slight judgment about the hour and how hard she was working it. But she\u2019s an adult and as someone who has never knowingly been pregnant, I have no idea about recommended rest, activity level, etc. \n\nHOWEVER, after a few songs, she was outside, smoking a cigarette! And loudly complaint \u201coh, I can\u2019t wait until I have this baby and I can drink again, it\u2019s goin doooown!\u201d\n\nI was shocked. I have never pivoted so fast from \u201cyou go, girl\u201d to \u201cyou can fuck all the way off\u201d. \nSmoking while pregnant is no joke. I can give credit for at least giving up alcohol but damn. That poor fetus. \n\nAnyway, NTA. If presented with respect and love, it was absolutely in your reach to say something.

It\u2019s the baby\u2019s body and brain we\u2019re worried about, but she\u2019s a selfish, pregnant minor That baby can get fetal alcohol syndrome or be messed up pretty hard, forever. All because she wants to be selfish and drink around friends.", "NTA. \n\nTeratogens, such as alcohol, have bigger effects on the fetus during the early stages of pregnancy. Good for you standing up for a child she is selfishly causing harm to with indifference.", "NTA, but your timing wasn't good. That's a conversation to have when she's sober. You can't reason with someone who's been drinking.", "NTA; However don't expect your words to have much of an impact. I once knew a woman I worked with who smoked and drank throughout her pregnancy to \"keep a low birth weight\" because as she said \" would hate the child if it ruined her body\". This women didn't look pregnant the entire time and maintained a 00 figure up until she gave birth. She didn't give a shit about the health of the child(it was her 5th) she just wanted to maintain her figure. All in all unfortunately there are a lot of women who really shouldn't be a mother but choose to be one for the benefits and child support( so ya'll know this woman was white and had separate father of all children and had knowingly got pregnant to trap the father.

There were only about 7 people there. My friend is pregnant and keeping it, and I'm the only one out of this group who knows.

I think the only thing you've done successfully is make sure your cousin won't spend time around you or confide in you if she needs help during the pregnancy. \ud83e\udd23 \n\nThere's no specific amount that is/isn't safe to drink while pregnant because the potential issues have shown up, or not, at all levels of exposure. Frankly, I imagine you just managed to come off as condescending and self-righteous, thus her reaction. By your own admission, you were super harsh about it and admit you have no business being involved in the first place.\n\nThe list of things women should or shouldn't eat, drink, look at, think about, be with 17m of, etc. is never ending and boils down to \"literally anything other than you being on IV nutrition in a clean room can have an impact on your fetus.\" Eliminating risk is impossible, and 3 beers with friends while she's processing the whole \"baby\" thing isn't exactly excessive.", "NTA fuck her", "You\u2019re nta.

I know I\u2019m going to be downvoted to hell and back. But I will stand my ground. \n\nNow, for my opinion. No woman pregnant should drink, do drugs, take many many many prescribed drugs, eat or drink from the no no list, which includes caffeine and lunch meat. When I was pregnant I followed the rules to a T. I cared about my unborn child and wanted what was best for him. I also wish that any other pregnant woman who plans to keep their baby thinks similarly. \n\nBut again, as a whole, as a government, we can\u2019t start instating stipulations onto a woman just because she is pregnant.

It's not about you or what you think is right. \n\nThe CORRECT way to voice a concern is just that.   Let her know you're concerned and want to make sure she is making good choices because alcohol (spicifically in early stages of pregnancy) can be harmful. \n\nThen let it go.

And btw, the system isn't equipped to provide adequate care. You're encouraging this 19 year old to drink pregnant? Pfft.. it's malicious behavior stemming from selfishness.

On the other hand, 'there's no amount of alcohol that IS safe' is also arguably inaccurate, because plenty of people have drinks and healthy babies.
