So instead of apologizing she's avoiding you to make you feel like what you said is the problem and not her actions.", "No, NTA\n\nYou didn't escalate\n\nYou didn't insult her and stoop to her level\n\nYou stood up for yourself in a respectful and assertive manner.", "NTA, I think you said just enough to get your point across.", "NTA. Obviously you were right. That's why she's upset. It's sensitive for anyone and you are entitled to your feelings. You didn't insult her or say anything bad, she has to learn to respect your feelings too.", "NTA. And don't give in to her little tactic there with the storming off and not talking to you routine. She knows she's wrong but can't apologize and wants you to feel like an ass so she can feel better about it. Wait til she's not pissed and have a civilized conversation, if that's not possible then maybe find a GF who doesn't act like that", "It\u2019s great that she won't talk to you.\n\nShe sounds toxic and really just mean AF. Do your feelings and well being truly not matter to her? Why are you with such a mean person?   \n\n\nNTA but really take a hard  look at this relationship. I promise you that there are many women who, if someone dared poke fun at their BF\u2019s extra \u201cfluffiness\u201d \u2026would start swinging. Find someone like that.", "NTA She's upset because it's true, if you did the same thing, she would probably probably cry. She's probably making fun of you because of her insecurities. Bullies often bully other people because of their own insecurities.", "NTA.  She sounds rude and inconsiderate.", "NTA you handled a terrible situation well.  She likely feels guilty about what she did, but rather than admit it, she's avoiding you.", "NTA, you simply told her how you felt.", "NTA. She's mad because you're right. I won't tell you to dump her or anything, many people can't handle being called out and she probably needs time to think a bit and come to terms with the fact she acted like a jerk. Probably she chose to make fun of you because she also feels inadequate - many people bully others because of their own insecurities. So maybe she's not trying to manipulate you, maybe she's just too ashamed/guilty of what she did and needs some time before she apologizes.\n\nOf course, don't escalate things and keep calm. If she's a reasonable person sooner or later you two will have a conversation about it. Give her space.\n\nOf course, if she starts drama or tries to deflect the blame it will be a problem, but I wouldn't assume the worst right away.", "NTA. You\u2019re obviously right. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s been married for 18 years, I can offer a bit of advise (which, take it or leave it - every relationship is different). Your communication that this was hurtful is critical. There are different standards (right or wrong) from men to women - she needs to know that she crossed a line. But be careful how you approach it, she needs to see it from your point of view - not that you\u2019re attacking her. It\u2019s a fine line, and I\u2019ve fucked it up plenty. Good luck.", "You need to find a nicer girlfriend ngl", "NTA. She knows she was wrong and that what she did was cruel, so she left to try to make you feel like you were in the wrong for calling her out. She is both cruel and manipulative, and she doesn't care that she hurt you. \n\nUnless she comes back groveling with an apology that shows she is truly remorseful (not just a half-assed apology or an attempt to make you feel like you need to apologize to her) within 24 hours, I'd text her that it's over because you deserve a partner who treats you as kindly as you treat them and one who accepts responsibility when they hurt you instead of walking out.", "Absolutely NTA, you are supposed to feel safe in a committed relationship with a romantic partner. \n\nThat said, I have to ask about the pubic hair coming out of your shorts\u2026that\u2019s just not ok.
