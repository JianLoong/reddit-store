I have a year and a half left and currently picking up extra duties, trainings, and volunteer opportunities to use for my resume. My husband fully supports this and has offered that I take a year off after work to relax, or I can become a homemaker. \n\nAs much as I would love to do either, I can't see myself not working. I would get easily bored after a month. I plan to get a part time job or a GS position, while also going to school as I have never been to college. The second reason is, as much as I love my husband, and I know he loves me, and we have been doing so great the last couple years, I feel uncomfortable relying on him financially. We are comfortable now due to his real estate side hustle and our stock investments, as we all know E4 pay is trash. But people change, people cheat, people fall out of love, people die, people divorce. I also want to make good money on my own. I don't want to wake up one day with divorce papers in my hands with no job and no education. Also, god forbid something happens to him medically and he gets out of the military, stocks crash, or something happens with his real estate. It's not that I think my husband will leave or cheat, or is planning on it, and neither am i, but how many stories have we all read of a spouse suddenly leaving out of nowhere and leaving the other with nothing?\n\n I told my husband this, and he laughed and said he understood, that he just wants to take care of me, but if that's not what I want, that's OK, he can in other ways, but he said the offer is always on the table. However, when talking to my coworkers and friends about this conversation(as they asked me what my plans were and what my husband thought) I've had mainly negative reactions. Most of them are saying that I'm planning on a divorce, that I don't trust my husband at all, and that this is showing him I can't trust him with my life. I know that it looks that way, but I like working, but I also feel extremely uncomfortable to rely on another person for my entire life financially. My friend J told me I'm spitting in his face basically and that I'm stupid to not take his offer when I've been so lucky to land a good guy with money.

Stay the course. NTA. Why are these people pushing you to become dependent on your husband?", "NTA. You are absolutely 100% right. Nobody ever plans on something bad happening. Nobody plans on falling out of love or dying but it does happen. Get yourself a good education, maybe work at least a part-time job. Invest the money. Let\u2019s say your marriage stays strong and your husband goes the distance with the military and retires in his 40s. You can have enough money to travel and enjoy your life. Let\u2019s say you decide to have children and the money you have saved now will let you be a stay at home mom until the kids go to school, or there will be money for college educations and weddings. Or God forbid, the worst thing happens. You will have the resources to move forward in your life without struggling. Ignore what your friends are saying do what you feel is right for you.", "NTA first of all if youre ok with it and hes ok with it then your coworkers can literally shut up cuz its none of their business. second of all your reasoning is absolutely fine most married women i know have jobs not because they need money or because they wanna get a divorce (some are from extremely traditional families and divorce isnt even an option for them) but because not working and staying at home all the time ages you, its truly exhausting and having something to do or focus on is really healthy!", "What?  Are your friends all Stepford wives?  \ud83d\ude02\n\nIf I understand your post correctly you are about to have a lot of \u201cfree time\u201d an about 18 months.  You can work, go to school, sleep, develop a passion for reclaimed pallet art, really the world is your oyster.  The only people who get to be concerned about how you spend your time are the ones in your marriage.\n\nYour reasons for wanting to pursue an education and employment are valid but if you don\u2019t want a bunch of biddies in your business I\u2019d stick to \u201coh, I\u2019m going to work and go back to school\u201d and leave out your motivations for why that\u2019s important to you.", "NTA.  I did 32 1/2 yrs in the military.  I gave my wife the option to work, but she chose to be a SAHM.  You know what AD is like and what spouses have to go through, so if you want to work, more power to you!\n\nOne thing to consider is what career field you might want to go into that\u2019s open to moving.  Remote is more of a thing now, so that opens up more opportunities than teaching or medical jobs.  There are some good scholarships out there as well as the GI Bill to get college or vocational training.  Thank you for your service!", "Nta. It your decision, your relationship.i know plenty of couples, myself included who wouldn't want to rely on someone regardless. On top of that working gives purpose. I'd be bored aswell after a month.

My Mom had to quit her good job (University staff) for the move. My older brother was 11 months old when they moved and they decided that my Mom would stay home with him for a bit and not look for a job. Obviously this was pre-internet and they had no network here. So my Mom was home all day everyday with a baby and no way to meet anyone. Only playground were at schools or churches. She\u2019d talk my Dad\u2019s ear off when he got home because she saw no one ALL DAY. He finally told her she had to get a job. He didn\u2019t care what it was. But she was not happy being a SAHM and he was not happy with her being a SAHM. She ended up working in IT making just as much as him.\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA. These people probably don't want to work but may have had to so they are jealous. It can't hurt to have your own money. You never know what can happen.", "NTA. Don't listen to your friends' negativity. There is nothing wrong with looking out for yourself and it is a very real possibility that even the strongest relationship can go south very quickly. Being in the military, I'm sure you've seen that happen pretty often.\n\nYour husband isn't even telling you not to get a job, he is just offering that you don't need to if it's what you want. It's entirely up to you.\n\nMe and my partner are former military and he said I didn't have to work either while I'm in school, but I'm with you. Screw that. I work and make my own money and he does the same.", "NTA for wanting to work and contribute financially. It also does not mean anything is broken in your relationship. It sounds like your husband understands and as long as the two of you are on the same page then no-one else\u2019s opinion matters. I also completely understand your point of view because I am the same.\n\nI\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant and talking about working part time after maternity leave (I\u2019m not in the US so 12 months leave is normal here). My husband is a shift worker and me going back to work will make day care difficult some weeks as we would rather my wage not be spent completely on child care. My husband has said he would be perfectly happy if I didn\u2019t work until our children reached school age. We can manage on my husband\u2019s wage alone but it\u2019s not solely about the money. I struggle with the idea of not contributing financially, even if my financial contribution is 5% of the household and my husband\u2019s is the rest because I have been independent with my own income so long. I acknowledge that I will contribute in other ways (being the primary carer of our child and I will take on a bigger proportion of the housework than the current 50/50 split we have now) but it just doesn\u2019t feel the same to me. It is also the mental stimulation and keeping your skills up just in case anything happened.\n\nTo me it sounds like you and your husband have a healthy relationship and as long as you are both happy with your decision and can communicate about it effectively then there is nothing wrong here", "NTA. Do what\u2019s best for you. If working is what you want to do then do it. It\u2019s perfectly normal to value your independence.", "NTA and fuck the \"friends.\" Find better friends.\n\n You are entitled to want to work and to want to go to school. Are these friends conservative sexist people who think women should be homemakers only or something?", "NTA.  Sounds like you and your husband are both on the same page. Who cares what anyone else thinks!", "NTA. Your marriage is between you and your husband. Your husband has no issues with your decision. Everyone else should keep their mouths shut.", "Nta", "NTA. Never feel bad about bettering yourself and making sure you can provide for yourself. My grandmother was left widowed with a 6 and 3 y.o. And a 7 week old newborn. She lost her husband and two sons in an accident. She was left with her invalid MIL with dementia and a BIL that claimed he helped but never did. She was college educated (rare in the 30s) and was able to provide for her family and send her three girls to college. My dad died when I was a tween\u2026again my mom was educated and able to get a good job and provide for me and my brother. He had some health issues related to his military service before he died.   \n\n\nAll that to say that you never know what your future holds so why not prepare yourself to the best of your ability?", "NAH except maybe your friends. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you and your husband what you want to do. He\u2019s fully supporting your decision whatever you decide to do which is good. Also it\u2019s a smart move to stay financially independent.", "You and your husband are in agreement.  He sounds like a good guy.  Your friends' opinions are immaterial.", "NTA. You don't want to be solely a Dependent. There is absolutely Nothing wrong with that.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to contribute to your financial future either. \n\nIf you signed up for the GI Bill, use it!!", "NTA.\nIt sounds like you and your husband have a wonderful and supportive relationship. He just wants you to be happy and follow your dreams. \nEveryone else trying to get in your head is either jealous or trying to project their \"ideal\" on you.", "NTA -- Homemaker is a JOB, and if it's not a job you think will suit you, then you absolutely shouldnt' take it. \n\nYour co-workers etc are being awful, it sounds like they resent your financial freedom and happy relationship.", "NTA, husband supportive, that's all that matters.", "NAH. Take your post 9/11 GI Bill and get your Bachelor's, you get E5 BAH w/dependents rate cash while you're in school even if your spouse is still AD and still collecting actual BAH. Sock that money away and save it for something nice. Of course you don't want to be a SAHM when you've been   on active duty for the last couple years. Take the time in school as a cool-down and see how you like it. Don't work while you're in school though.", "Stop talking to other people about a decision that is solely between you and your husband. Then you won\u2019t get negative comments and then you won\u2019t have to ask if you\u2019re the AH.", "NTA you need better friends! They are extremely shortsighted and are giving you terrible advice. Friends like this will only hold you back in life.", "Why are you listening to other people? The only opinions that matter are yours and his. Tell everyone else to screw off.", "NTA. Sounds like you need better friends though!\n\n\nWanting to be prepared for any potential negative outcomes is crazy smart. That said, it sounds like you and your partner have a great relationship, so if none of the worst case scenarios do happen then with a second income your quality life improves. You can get a house in a nicer neighborhood, or travel more, or not feel bad about buying that overly expense thing you really like. No harm in any of that. Plus, then you relieve some pressure from his shoulders and hopefully free him up to spend more time together since he won\u2019t be trying to take on a bunch of extra work to pay the mortgage. It\u2019s win-win all around, especially if you both agree!", "Nta mostly. You have the right to work, but your reasoning with him is gross. In a good marriage talking about divorce, cheating, and dying are super negative. Maybe talked about very, very carefully, like talking about life insurance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's very generous especially with Yellow Ribbon.", "I know im here for judgement, but i have to disagree with your words about talking about those subjects. Cheating and divorce was a long talk while getting our prenups done, and in the beginning of our relationship we talked about what we each considered cheating, to let each other know our boundaries. Death was important to speak about as we both are military and have both been deployed to dangerous countries, so had to discuss POAs and life insurance and what either of us would want to happen in the aftermath of death. All were in depth, legal discussions that I believe all marriages should take with upmost seriousness.", "This is so unrealistic. The negatives are part of life and need to be dealt with. Not discussing things because they're negative leads to poor communication. You can't live fully with your head buried in the sand.", "I see your point now. We were having a serious conversation about my decision to get out, and doing a step by step plan for the aftermath. I expressed my reasoning much more gently then I worded it the post. Being medical military we are surrounded by cheating, divorce, and death, so its a topic we are comfortable talking about in serious conversations.", "No, her friends are assholes.

Trust has nothing to do with wanting to be smart about your future.", "And she's wise to. Anything can happen, and she is way better off maintaining her independence, just in case. They could break up, he could die or develop a drug habit, or one of hundreds of other things. Why are his friends pushing to turn her into Suzy Housewife?", "You two sound like you have great communication. NTA. Having your own source of income is necessary to feel secure.", "To clarify..  Discussing them independent of wanting to work at a job or not working at a job.

It makes sense that your skins are tougher where you're still in the thick of it.", "Exactly, and they are in the military, it's not exactly the safest occupation....so yeah I wouldn't say this is about a lack of trust but wanting to be prepared.

Why do you lack reading comprehension?", "Would you tell him you want to go to work in case he dies?", "Not in a heated discussion. No. Never. I would want to work because I wanted to. Not because I plan on him being dead.", "Because anything can happen to anyone, you do need to plan in case it does happen. It doesn't read like OP and her husband had a heated discussion.  Just open communication. You sound as if you're afraid of dealing with these sorts of things.", "Absolutely not, and I deal with them and have a healthy marriage. \nBut it does sound like you are attempting to have a heated conversation with me.
