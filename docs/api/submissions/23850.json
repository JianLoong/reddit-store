I (19f) am pregnant with twin boys and this is my first pregnancy. For a little background info my father (38M) and my mother (39f) separated when I was a child age 5. At that point I had several siblings and was helping my mother to raise my siblings. My older sister was not mentally stable to do it. But my father was not in the picture until I was about 12 maybe 13 years old when I went behind my moms back and got Facebook I tracked him down and we kept in touch ever since. But back to the issue at hand I became pregnant with twins eight months ago when I was drugged at party one of my friends were having. When I found out she knew who had done it and told them I was pregnant I was furious with her and cut her off right then and there. But my issues aren\u2019t with her but my step mother (25f). My stepmother is infertile due to having an abortion when she was 16. She feels like me being drugged and becoming pregnant is a miracle for her. She had tracked me down through my father and social media accounts and contacted me. We met up last week when I was feeling better from having really bad allergy attacks. Anyway when we met up she commented on how beautiful I was and how she hopes I\u2019m healthy and keeping her babies healthy. I should have ran at that comment but I just thought she was looking forward to becoming a step grandmother. But I just laughed it off and said yes me and my twins are very healthy. She looked stand-offish towards me calling the twins mine but proceeded to have us order lunch. We discussed her infertility issues and how her and my father wished they could have children of their own. I felt for her I really did but when she sprung her question on me I was dumbfounded. I told her straight up that it was a no. She would not be taking my babies and I wished her the best of luck and left her at the cafe we met up at. Ever since then her family and my fathers parents, my grandparents, have been texting or calling me telling me I\u2019m an *sshole for not giving into her request. My father is especially mad at me for not doing it. So Reddit am I the *sshole?", "created_utc": 1691144908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hwc71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_stepmother_my/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What kind of AH would even ask that?", "Wtf did I just read? \n\nMy God the entitlement in this one is off the charts! She met you to discuss the property rights of your babies. I\u2019m guessing someone, (most probably your dad given his reaction) prompted her to reach out to you thinking you might be up for adoption. \n\nI\u2019m sorry someone took advantage of you. I\u2019m sorry that people are still trying to take advantage of your situation. Go NC ASAP and stay that way forever. \n\nAnd no, NTA.", "NTA NTA & NTA. Whatever gave your Stepmom (who you've never met!!)the idea you were willing to hand over your unborn babies to her ?\n\nSteer well clear of your Stepmom and Father. Also least try get some legal advice to ensure this is documented so you and your little family are protected from the offset.", "NTA - its totally up to you, to decide. and you did that a while ago i assume\n\ndid they assume these are unwanted baby's? \n\nand even then they just flat-out aks for them to take them as their own? when you don't even know each other well.\n\nim even more upset with her family and your fathers parents, especially the grandparents. for going with such an idiotic idea. even more so at this stage of your pregnancy. where you most probably are set up to raise them yourself. \n\ni hope you have people to support you in these times", "NTA this woman is crazy contact the police and just let them know what has happened. Also why would this stranger assume your giving your babies to her. Holy hell how scary.", "NTA.  It sounds like you need to start distancing yourself from your Dad and Stepmother.  Don't forget, you don't have to tolerate someone's bullshit just because they are blood...or married to blood.", "NTA - and WTF was your SM and Dad thinking?", "Your stepmother bypassed your father and instead used social media to track you down directly, assumed you were giving up your children *to her*, and cried to your father's family that you were stealing her chance to be a mom? Her immaturity level is astounding.\n\nThat your father and his parents also see themselves as entitled to your children is insane. They've been in your life for 6 years and thought \"Hey, lucky us! The kid I ran out on when I was her age is having kids that she'll *obviously* want to run out on as well, so she'll jump at the chance to give them to us!\"?\n\nWhile I'm sure you've spent the last 8 months or so thinking about your next steps, it doesn't sound like you had previously discussed with your father the possibility of giving the children up for adoption. You already have a good idea of how difficult it will be to be a single mother at such a young age. Whether you keep them or give them up is completely up to you. An adoption within the family could have been a benefit all the way around, but it sounds like their plans for your kids didn't involve you at all. NTA", "Wow someone has gonads the size of an elephant's, wow just wow.  Of course you're NTA  What an assumption and she and your dad, and his family are coming across so entitled.  You're so NTA", "Make sure to lock down who can come when you give birth they might try to take the babies", "INFO: did you plan or have you planed and communicate it to your father at any point to give up your children for adoption? If so it would be - still a strange way, but maybe more understandible - why your stepmother tried to get your children. \n\nBut eighter way. NTA!\n\nThey are your children. It is your descission alone if you want to raise them, if you want to give them for adoption or if you will let your stepmother get custody.\n\nDepending on how the situation is and how your stepmother ist, eighter try to tell her, if she wants to get children she should adopt children who are up for adoption or try a surrogate mother. But if you have a bad feeling, if you think your stepmother could do anything to harm you, so she would get the children - maybe try to contact a lawer, a help center for young mothers, a psychologist or maybe something in this manner. You are young and there will be times, where you will struggel with the children. Make sure your stepmother will not be able to use those phases against you to run to child protection service, scream 'bad teen mother who neglacts her shildren' and at worst get your children takn from you.", "This is a really easy answer, NTA. Of course you aren't. Tell those baby snatching idiots to fuck off, straight to their faces.", "I\u2019m not sure who gave them the idea that this was something I\u2019d be okay doing but as for right now I\u2019m stepping away from my want to have a relationship with my father for the safety of my sons.", "Not something i want to do since I\u2019ve only just begun to establish a good relationship with my father but if ouch comes to shove I\u2019ll have no choice since I don\u2019t have only me to think about anymore.", "This. Do not let these people baby sit! This is giving really bad kidnap vibes.", "Yes I\u2019ve heard about this too and I would never subject my babies to that kind of horror. They are my babies and I\u2019m going to love and cherish them with everything I have.", "I haven\u2019t thought about that I\u2019ve been admitted to the hospital due to stress of the whole situation. I\u2019ll have to do that when im feeling better. Thank you!", "I\u2019m not sure what prompted her to ask me such a question but once I\u2019m out of the hospital and if more things go happen I\u2019ll be sure to post an update if that\u2019s something anyone is interested in.", "Thank you for the advice! I\u2019ll be sure to do as soon as I\u2019m released from the hospital.", "My mother and her side of the family are\nWell aware of the situation and have been berating them for the situation ever since I got admitted on Monday morning. I assume as well that they thought they were unwanted but my babies are definitely not they are loved and cherished by everyone on my mothers side of the family. As well as by me I\u2019m not giving them up to anyone.", "I have already begun the process of distancing myself from my father. As heartbreaking as it for me at the moment I have the love and support from my mom and that\u2019s all I need. It\u2019s just been us and my siblings for a long time and it\u2019s all I want for the rest of my life.

At first it hard to accept and my mom had told me she would support me through any decision I made as long it was a decision I made with not only head but my heart and I\u2019m glad I listened to her advice because while I know it\u2019ll be hard to raise them alone and be judged harshly in my community for being so young I\u2019ll still love them with everything I have \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "Definitely! I have already told the staff that will be with me during the delivery who will be in the delivery room.", "Thank you for bringing that up to me it hasn\u2019t even begun to cross my mind on how far she would to get to my sons. I\u2019ll have to post an update soon but No I have not communicated to my father in anyway shape or form that I would be giving up my children. Tho he has mentioned ways of how he could help but it didn\u2019t click on what he was insinuating until now. Honestly with everything that has happened I think she\u2019s viewing me as a surrogate. I\u2019ll have to get in touch with my uncle on my moms side for legal advice ASAP! Thank you for mentioning this!!", "I just hope your father and SM will be more understanding and reasonable, hope you're alright", "Honestly I felt the very same vibe and I\u2019ve listened to podcasts about this kind of thing and it chills me to my core how people can bring themselves to do that. So yes definitely not going to be babysitting the twins when the time comes.", "You can also ask a nurse if there's an officer at the hospital you could talk to. The hospitalization would add weight to the case.", "Yes please! I hope it goes well for you and the boys!", "I know that's hard to do because I've been through it myself.  Stay strong because you have to take care of yourself.  Surround yourself with people that want to help you do that, and let the rest of them fuck off.  Having said that, good for you and good luck with however this ends up.", "Thank you! I\u2019m holding onto hope for that too but I have a feeling my father doesn\u2019t have the full story since I haven\u2019t talked to him properly since meeting my SM for the first time.", "I\u2019ll have to ask my nurse when she comes around for a possibility of that. Thank you!", "Thank you! I\u2019ll be sure to post and update as soon as possible. So far everything is alright just the stress of the situation almost brought me into an early labor.", "Thank you!! I\u2019ll be sure to update to how the situation ends if that\u2019s something everyone is interested in me doing but for now thank you so much to you and everyone that has giving me advice and encouragement to stay strong!", "Just make you and the babies priority number 1. Family stuff can be taken care of after, your pregnancy is more important.", "Ofc! I can\u2019t thank everyone whose read my story enough for the suggestions I\u2019ve been giving! As heartbroken as I\u2019ll be to lose my father over this. I\u2019ll be okay because I\u2019ll have my sons and I just can\u2019t wait to meet them and the people that they\u2019ll become!", "I'm sure you'll be a great mum and they will be proud when one day you will tell them how much you fought for them.", "Aww thank you! I\u2019ve dreamed about being a mom ever since I met my little sister and became the big sister so having this chance to experience motherhood has been really great! \ud83e\udd79"]}
