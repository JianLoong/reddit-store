I own a car, but she doesn\u2019t. Because of this, I drive us both to campus every day in time for my 9am class. It takes 15 mins to get there, so we have to leave by 8:35am to have enough time to park. \n\nThe problem is that she's never ready to leave on time. Instead of 8:35, we always end up leaving closer to 8:45. This means that, since the start of the semester, I have been late to my 9:00am class every day by 5-10 mins. I honestly don\u2019t care if she\u2019s late as long as it doesn\u2019t affect my grades. I communicated this to her many times, and she said she will try harder. \n\nIn the past 2 weeks, however, she\u2019s been taking even longer than usual, making us leave at \\~8:50 instead. At this point, I\u2019m walking into class 15+ mins late. \n\nI tried dealing with this situation in several ways, like helping her pick out an outfit, making her breakfast, giving her some tips(i.e pack everything/shower the night before), getting up 30 mins earlier etc.\n\nUnfortunately none of these worked. If anything, she said that I was stressing her out, and as a result, causing her to take longer. \n\nNow, the incident.\n\nYesterday, she wasn\u2019t ready to leave until 8:55am. I consider myself a pretty forgiving person but this was my last straw. I gave her an ultimatum: either she is ready to leave by 8:40 tomorrow, or I won\u2019t be driving her. I told her that I wasn\u2019t mad and I can see her trying(which is true), but I have a difficult test tomorrow at 9:00am.\n\nFast forward to this morning. At 8:40, she still wasn't dressed. At this point I'm really frustrated. At 8:45, I stated that I was about to leave. She told me she needed a couple more mins, which I doubted. I told her I\u2019ll wait in the car, but that I\u2019m leaving without her if she can\u2019t be out by 8:50. At 8:52, there was no sign of her so I drove off. \n\nShe called me 5 mins later crying and apologizing. Then, got angry because she had no other way of getting to school. This meant that she was going to miss all of her classes and not be able to make her shift. I calmly told her that I\u2019m sorry, and we\u2019ll have a proper conversation about this when I get back. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then, and has yet to come home. \n\nI told one of my friends about it and he called me cruel for leaving her stranded, and potentially jeopardizing her job. I also feel like an AH and that I let my frustration get the better of me. At the same time, I\u2019ve given her so many chances to do better, and I didn't want to fail this test. We've been dating for 3 years so far, and I'm scared I might've ruined our relationship.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677043386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118pv9z/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_stranded_and/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless there is no option for Uber/Lyft/taxi, She didn\u2019t have to miss the whole day of activities. That\u2019s on her too.", "I don't understand how her whole day is ruined. I get missing one class but the whole day? If the drive is only 15 min then a bus ride should not be more than 1 hour or maybe  2 if it needs multiple connections. An uber ride should be around 30min or so including the wait . What I am I missing?", "She's an adult, not a toddler.", "I have really bad, really clich\u00e9 ADHD time blindness. My time management skills are mostly non-existent, and all the trying in the world will often not suffice. I have absolutely caused my partner to be late to something a bunch of times.\n\nWe are both aware of this, so we talk about it. And I will be open about possibly not managing x timeline ahead of time, so he can make an informed decision on planning. Especially if it's for a time-sensitive matter (and what's time-sensitive *to him* is also not my call to make).\n\nIf this had happened to us, I would probably have called him crying as well, and maybe angry. But angry at myself, stressing that I'm sorry, and asking if I can improve the situation right now, and/or make up for my mistake in any way. Then, we would improve our planning for the future from there.\n\nFrom my perspective, OP's partner may indeed be trying and giving her actual best to be on time. I also strongly object to the implication that not succeeding in it says anything about OP's worth to her.\n\nBut even with all that in mind, partner is absolutely TA for how she handles her timing issues and their consequences. I can't see any way OP could've handled this without feeling bad about themselves - feeling like you let someone down just sucks, even if you rationally *know* that's not what actually happened. But the friend sure failed them.\n\nETA: Oh, and I would have actively insisted on separate transportation plans (at least as back up, but preferably first choice) for the morning of the test, if I were OP's partner. Because, y'know, self reflection and not unnecessarily straining someone I love because of my personal struggles.", "Yeah, you're right. I was more meaning that she missed a few classes and one shift of work, not a huge deal while OP could have missed a test they potentially can't make up.", "Doesnt seem much of an adult , being ready on time to leave is something highschoolers manage to do", "I just dont understand why it isnt an option to cure this \"time blindness\" with an alarm on the mobile phone called \"Go NOW or never\" or sth like this and several alarms before that indicate what has to be done now. How is it even possible to take more time if she tries to be faster? She doesnt even, like he stated, acknowledges OPs tipps. Edit to add: The best part is her getting angry at him and the proposal to let her ask how to improve this failed situation as she doesnt do the ONE thing that would improve it and which wouldnt lead to her being stranded", "Maybe years back that was the case but now any postsecondary school in the US  that has students on federally based financial aid has to have DETAILED attendance records.", "Oh I wasn\u2019t disagreeing with you at all!! I was just adding that she was being super melodramatic about being \u201cabandoned\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "I should have been more clear, but that's my point.  It's not his job to get her up and ready. If she's not ready to go at 8:35, she's on her own.", "That's how I deal with mine or \"force\" myself to leave. I was taught to be early for appointment/work by about 10 or so minutes. So I mentally made the start time that.\n\nI basically turned my morning routine into a science to know exactly how my longer I can stretch my lay in bed time.", "See, that requires taking ownership of the issue instead of inconveniencing others. I have multiple alarms on my phone that help to tell me I need to leave now or I will be late to X, because I do struggle with time management. Time blindness is an explanation for why the GF is struggling, but it isn\u2019t an excuse for it. GF needs to step up and get it under control. She struggles with it more than most people, so it is on her to find solutions that fix the problem.", "Yep, my wife and I both have this problem related to AD(H)D, so we set tiered alarms when we really need to be somewhere at a specific time (our daily work schedules are both WFH and flexible). I.E. Early alarm for 'aspirational' time we want to wake up, second alarm for realistic time we'll wake up after snoozing, third alarm for when we need to be actually out of bed (accounting for time checking email/putzing on internet to wake up and adjust our eyes to the lights being on), a waterproof rubber duck alarm in the shower (because that's prime zone-out conditions), a 10 minutes before we need to be out the door alarm, and an alarm from \"go now or never\"", "Alarms can definitely help, and are something people like me and the person you're replying to try to use when something's especially time sensitive (airport, beating traffic, *significant other has a big test).* The downsides are\n\n1. If your schedule changes, you need to get around to adjusting your alarm. This is harder than it should be.\n2. If you get too reliant on your alarm, and your phone is charging in a different room, or dead, it might make you late when you otherwise wouldn't be.\n3. If you start to set too many alarms or calendar reminders, because you finally have a tool that helps you, you can start to get too used to them and snooze/dismiss them as soon as they pop up without it actually entering your brain that they went off, and then alarms are completely useless for you until you break that habit.\n\nAll of the above are addressable, and OP's girlfriend is definitely TA (for not making an extra effort on this specific day, and then for being mad when OP did what he had to), but that's why you can't always count on alarms to \"cure\" time blindness.", "Years back was less than 10 years ago... So I suppose it could have changed, but I kinda doubt it.", "Ahh. Cool. Yeah, I obviously agree.", "Yeah, but they are a couple. I would find in hilaripus if every morning id have blast an alarm to wake them up as we leaving together", "I bet that is not that easy and still you do it in order to succeed, reach your goal and don't cause problems. I applaud you for your actions", "Thank you! I sometimes have a hard time with those people that say \"I have XY which is why I can't help but be late/make everything dirty/xyz\" when it is obvious that there are very reasonable actions that could be taken which would solve those problems", "My daughter has had them lock the door after 10 mins so that no one else can come in and dusrupt the class", "Oh it's absolutely changed.  If a student on federal aid doesn't finish the class you have to be able to document attendance.", "Yeah, F that.  She needs to figure out how to adult.", "To an extent. I am currently working on some \"side effects\" of this time management and working to iron lit the kinks. I do have sympathy for OPs partner, but she can also do different things like finding her own ride, public transportation, and possibly saving up for a car.\n\nThe community college I went to was able to get free bus passes for showing school ID.\n\nOdds are she is just as frustrated at herself, but to OP doesn't seem like she is doing anything to fix it. Even with my own mess of time blindness moments, I don't appreciate people being late w/o reason being late to things I have hosted consistently.", "I find it a very useful phrase for talking about ADHD and other executive dysfunctions. You struggle with X so you need to work on it more and might be more prone to slip-ups, but it isn\u2019t an excuse to not work on X. Everyone has stuff they struggle with. If you know why X is a struggle, it can be easier to manage it than if you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not an excuse to not try to do X at all. That isn\u2019t healthy.", "Same for me. Not all of them, but most were pretty strict when it came to walking in late. It is distracting, and disrespectful to everyone else in the room when it happens regularly."]}
