I own a car, but she doesn\u2019t. Because of this, I drive us both to campus every day in time for my 9am class. It takes 15 mins to get there, so we have to leave by 8:35am to have enough time to park. \n\nThe problem is that she's never ready to leave on time. Instead of 8:35, we always end up leaving closer to 8:45. This means that, since the start of the semester, I have been late to my 9:00am class every day by 5-10 mins. I honestly don\u2019t care if she\u2019s late as long as it doesn\u2019t affect my grades. I communicated this to her many times, and she said she will try harder. \n\nIn the past 2 weeks, however, she\u2019s been taking even longer than usual, making us leave at \\~8:50 instead. At this point, I\u2019m walking into class 15+ mins late. \n\nI tried dealing with this situation in several ways, like helping her pick out an outfit, making her breakfast, giving her some tips(i.e pack everything/shower the night before), getting up 30 mins earlier etc.\n\nUnfortunately none of these worked. If anything, she said that I was stressing her out, and as a result, causing her to take longer. \n\nNow, the incident.\n\nYesterday, she wasn\u2019t ready to leave until 8:55am. I consider myself a pretty forgiving person but this was my last straw. I gave her an ultimatum: either she is ready to leave by 8:40 tomorrow, or I won\u2019t be driving her. I told her that I wasn\u2019t mad and I can see her trying(which is true), but I have a difficult test tomorrow at 9:00am.\n\nFast forward to this morning. At 8:40, she still wasn't dressed. At this point I'm really frustrated. At 8:45, I stated that I was about to leave. She told me she needed a couple more mins, which I doubted. I told her I\u2019ll wait in the car, but that I\u2019m leaving without her if she can\u2019t be out by 8:50. At 8:52, there was no sign of her so I drove off. \n\nShe called me 5 mins later crying and apologizing. Then, got angry because she had no other way of getting to school. This meant that she was going to miss all of her classes and not be able to make her shift. I calmly told her that I\u2019m sorry, and we\u2019ll have a proper conversation about this when I get back. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then, and has yet to come home. \n\nI told one of my friends about it and he called me cruel for leaving her stranded, and potentially jeopardizing her job. I also feel like an AH and that I let my frustration get the better of me. At the same time, I\u2019ve given her so many chances to do better, and I didn't want to fail this test. We've been dating for 3 years so far, and I'm scared I might've ruined our relationship.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677043386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118pv9z/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_stranded_and/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dude I hate being late and if she can't get her shit in gear it's just disrespectful to you. You tried more then enough and she needs to be an adult and understand that there are timelines.
