I own a car, but she doesn\u2019t. Because of this, I drive us both to campus every day in time for my 9am class. It takes 15 mins to get there, so we have to leave by 8:35am to have enough time to park. \n\nThe problem is that she's never ready to leave on time. Instead of 8:35, we always end up leaving closer to 8:45. This means that, since the start of the semester, I have been late to my 9:00am class every day by 5-10 mins. I honestly don\u2019t care if she\u2019s late as long as it doesn\u2019t affect my grades. I communicated this to her many times, and she said she will try harder. \n\nIn the past 2 weeks, however, she\u2019s been taking even longer than usual, making us leave at \\~8:50 instead. At this point, I\u2019m walking into class 15+ mins late. \n\nI tried dealing with this situation in several ways, like helping her pick out an outfit, making her breakfast, giving her some tips(i.e pack everything/shower the night before), getting up 30 mins earlier etc.\n\nUnfortunately none of these worked. If anything, she said that I was stressing her out, and as a result, causing her to take longer. \n\nNow, the incident.\n\nYesterday, she wasn\u2019t ready to leave until 8:55am. I consider myself a pretty forgiving person but this was my last straw. I gave her an ultimatum: either she is ready to leave by 8:40 tomorrow, or I won\u2019t be driving her. I told her that I wasn\u2019t mad and I can see her trying(which is true), but I have a difficult test tomorrow at 9:00am.\n\nFast forward to this morning. At 8:40, she still wasn't dressed. At this point I'm really frustrated. At 8:45, I stated that I was about to leave. She told me she needed a couple more mins, which I doubted. I told her I\u2019ll wait in the car, but that I\u2019m leaving without her if she can\u2019t be out by 8:50. At 8:52, there was no sign of her so I drove off. \n\nShe called me 5 mins later crying and apologizing. Then, got angry because she had no other way of getting to school. This meant that she was going to miss all of her classes and not be able to make her shift. I calmly told her that I\u2019m sorry, and we\u2019ll have a proper conversation about this when I get back. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then, and has yet to come home. \n\nI told one of my friends about it and he called me cruel for leaving her stranded, and potentially jeopardizing her job. I also feel like an AH and that I let my frustration get the better of me. At the same time, I\u2019ve given her so many chances to do better, and I didn't want to fail this test. We've been dating for 3 years so far, and I'm scared I might've ruined our relationship.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677043386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118pv9z/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_stranded_and/", "score": 301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, not for nothing, but your partner wasn't stranded. She was in a safe place, your home, and I assume that she could've called an Uber (or another ride share service, depending on your location). She did not need to sit there all day complaining you're jeopardizing her future (not true). She needs to learn there are consequences to her behavior. You did nothing wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for spelling only.", "NTA. You are way more patient than I would have been! You gave her multiple chances, tried helping her time manage better in the morning, and gave her plenty of warnings. You also DID NOT leave her stranded. She could have called a cab or Uber. She didn\u2019t want to. Instead she wanted to try and guilt trip you. Tell her from now on you are leaving at X time and if she\u2019s not ready you will leave again. Stick to it. Your friend is wrong, you weren\u2019t cruel to her. She had options and warnings and she made her own choice.", "YTA, to yourself. You\u2019re clearly not taking your own education very seriously if you\u2019re strolling up to an hour long class 10-15 minutes late, on top of it definitely being an issue some professors will fail you in the course for. It\u2019s extremely disrespectful to show up that late every single day. Your girlfriend is in college. It\u2019s time to say, \u201cI need to leave at 8:35. I\u2019m doing you a favor but I\u2019m done having it ruin my education. You\u2019re either ready to leave by 8:35 exactly, not even 8:36, or you need to make another arrangement. It isn\u2019t fair to me and quite frankly? I don\u2019t really want to date someone who doesn\u2019t know how to get somewhere on time.\u201d", "NTA, she for sure sounds like one of those girls that will very nonchalantly be like I\u2019m almost ready, while doing nothing to hurry and also not caring at all", "NTA with a question: when you are rutinely late, do you interrupt the class you are late to? Because in this you might not be an ah, but if you are every single day getting late when the class has already began, you are one to your classmates and the professor.", "NTA. You should have done that sooner. And why can't she call an uber or a lyft? How about another friend or take the bus? Taxi? She's gaslighting and manipulating you. It's not your fault she's what we adults call \"lazy.\" She is her own person and needs to take responsibility for her own actions or lack thereof in this situation. Do not keep enabling her bad behavior. It's not doing you or her any favors. What is she doing that she can't get up on time or take forever getting ready? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou NEED to be on time for your classes. Let her find her own transportation.", "NTA\n\ni don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my uni but a lot of times if you\u2019re late you\u2019re not allowed in. \n\nyou are paying to be there, at least be early/on time.", "NTA she can uber or check foogle maps for a bus route.  Im willing to bet she doesnt haveaa 9 am class, or if she does shes skipping. Which is not a valid reason to make you late. If she wants to leave later then she needs to find alternative transportation, altuough good bet a bus wont be much faster. A 20 minute drive to work is an hour on the bus between stops, weird routes, and waiting for a transfer.", "NTA. You set clear expectations multiple times.", "ESH your partner sucks for not getting ready on time for a known leave date. \n\nYou suck for accommodating them for so long. You created a situation where there were no consequences for your partner disregarding your time deadline.\n\nYour partner sucks more for being upset at you for enforcing boundaries, and that\u2019s something to think about in this relationship.\n\nYou being \u201ckind\u201d to your partner by waiting for her primarily harms you because you aren\u2019t getting the full class time that you paid for, and it harms the class because you are consistently disruptive when you are late.", "Wow. You have her ample opportunity and tried to help. You set a boundary and enforced it. NTA.", "Nta. She needs to figure herself out. She doesn\u2019t need to have her hair and make up perfect to go to class. If she\u2019s late she can just brush her hair, through on a hoodie and go. There\u2019s no excuse.", "NTA\n\nAnd isn't it interesting that you are here, feeling guilty about her missing some classes and a shift when she doesn't feel guilty at all about make you missing a lot more classes bc of her (add all the late time and convert it to classes) and even making you late for an important test? \n\nAnd no, her saying \"i'm sorry\" doesn't mean she is really sorry, if she were you would have been late exactly one time and never again bc she would have been ready. She is just taking advantage of you being nice and is now pissed its not working anymore and will guilttrip you till you agree to just suck it up again in the future. I would take a close look at this relationship.", "Ride sharing, public transportation, walking, calling a friend, ACTUALLY BEING READY ON TIME are all options available to her.\n\nNot a morning person but best believe I have a routine set where I\u2019m always on time/early if someone else is giving me a ride. \n\nNTA", "NTA. When I was in college, if you were more than 5 mins late you were marked absent for the entire day. She\u2019s putting your education at risk, you could get kicked out of school and she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s taught you how much she really cares\u2026.for your car and her rides.", "NTA. You are her partner, not her parent. I will say, her lateness may be due to something beyond her control (adhd/executive function). I deal with this with my daughter every single day. It has really become worse as she has become older and she really got off routine when Covid/school shutdown happened. I\u2019m at the point that I think medication is the only solution at this point. Having to medicate her makes me absolutely miserable, but it seems like the only option at this point. Otherwise, she will grow into an adult who cannot function on a schedule (like your partner).", "Nta, altho, did you try waking her up early? Or just drag he rin pjs with you and she can change ina  bathroom worst case", "NTA. She is disrespectful of your time and energy. This is not a one time thing. It keeps happening because she's too selfish to put in any effort. Do you think so poorly of yourself to let your bar be this low? I don't live in either of y'all's lives, but ya girl either isn't mature enough to be in a relationship or just doesn't care about you.", "NTA. She doesn't respect your time, only hers. she got pissed when you warned her about it and started being even later, my bet is on purpose. Maybe this will help her realize what an asshole she is, but if she leaves you over it then you're better off.", "NTA, you're GF is an inconsiderate person, but you need to stop enabling her. Also your friend's logic is distorted. For one, what about your? For another if you giving her a ride is so critical, why is she leaving with no choice but to leave her behind?", "INFO:  why is she late?  Does she have trouble waking up on time?  Or does she wake up, but then just inexplicably take too long to get ready (even if her routine is theoretically complete-able in the time she has to get ready)?     \n       \nIs she constantly late even to her own important shit?  Like if she is going out with friends or something is she already late?      \n        \nHas she ever been tested for any sort of executive dysfunction? (Which can come from a variety of things like ADHD or head injuries)", "This sounds like me and my wife\u2026.I\u2019m never ready on time.\n\nSo I get dressed first- and I pack a bag for all the things I need to do in the car.\n\nSo I\u2019m ready to go out the door on time and then hair and eyebrows get done on the road.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, sounds like you two have a system- she needs to step up.", "He isn\u2019t obligated to make himself late, he isn\u2019t TA for leaving\u2026 but there is a very good Chance that the girlfriend is constantly late because she had some sort of executive dysfunction issue.  So it could easily be more of a medical issue / disability than just selfishness.", "He already is, from the sound of things. This dude needs out of this relationship ASAP.", "OP is a girl.", "I think the important questions is whether they are also routinely late for their OWN shit that they really care about, or only late when it inconveniences other people but not themselves.", "> So it could easily be more of a medical issue / disability than just selfishness.\n\nNot really - because she's well past the point where a failure to address the problem despite the effect it's having on other people is *still* selfish in-and-of itself. That would be context - it wouldn't diminish her responsibility.", "People  with executive function issues still have to find a way to solve the problem of being late and she hasn't. I have ADHD. I am chronically late for one reason or another (usually because I keep forgetting things). My kids are the same, we've had to create a strict routine to be on time. I warn people that I'm chronically late. I have appts that I forget about until i check my calendar and even then I set those appts 15 min earlier in my calendar so I can show up on time. I had to force myself to show up to school an hour early so I wouldn't be late, and this was with kids. Kids make time management do much more worse. \n\n\nPeople with ED issues are still dealing with this, and it looks like the GF isn't addressing what's causing her to be late. Just the fact that she wasn't dressed by the original time to leave makes it look like she isn't trying to solve the problem. She has a routine starting late and ending late. And every time she's given leeway, that routine gets later, making the situation worse.\n\n\nOP, Try setting an earlier time. Go ridiculously early if you have to. Plan to leave for class by 9:15 and tell her you're leaving 9:40 at the latest, no exceptions, and if she cant make it happen she needs to have a ride lined up or find some other way to get to school.\n\nINFO: how was she getting to school beforehand? I live in a metro area so I took the bus until I could get a car.", "*She*", "It's college, the professors don't care 99% of the time.\n\nI've only ever taken one class that took attendance/cared if people were late.", "Not the ones I had at least, not that they took attendance but being late was an issue", "Eh, as long as the person was quiet and non disruptive about it, not really a big deal.\n\nBut I suppose it depends on the type of class, much easier to be quiet and non disruptive sneaking into the back of a 300 person lecture than it is sneaking into a 12 person class.\n\nEdit - and, obviously, labs are the exception where being late is actually a problem."]}
