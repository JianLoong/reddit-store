I own a car, but she doesn\u2019t. Because of this, I drive us both to campus every day in time for my 9am class. It takes 15 mins to get there, so we have to leave by 8:35am to have enough time to park. \n\nThe problem is that she's never ready to leave on time. Instead of 8:35, we always end up leaving closer to 8:45. This means that, since the start of the semester, I have been late to my 9:00am class every day by 5-10 mins. I honestly don\u2019t care if she\u2019s late as long as it doesn\u2019t affect my grades. I communicated this to her many times, and she said she will try harder. \n\nIn the past 2 weeks, however, she\u2019s been taking even longer than usual, making us leave at \\~8:50 instead. At this point, I\u2019m walking into class 15+ mins late. \n\nI tried dealing with this situation in several ways, like helping her pick out an outfit, making her breakfast, giving her some tips(i.e pack everything/shower the night before), getting up 30 mins earlier etc.\n\nUnfortunately none of these worked. If anything, she said that I was stressing her out, and as a result, causing her to take longer. \n\nNow, the incident.\n\nYesterday, she wasn\u2019t ready to leave until 8:55am. I consider myself a pretty forgiving person but this was my last straw. I gave her an ultimatum: either she is ready to leave by 8:40 tomorrow, or I won\u2019t be driving her. I told her that I wasn\u2019t mad and I can see her trying(which is true), but I have a difficult test tomorrow at 9:00am.\n\nFast forward to this morning. At 8:40, she still wasn't dressed. At this point I'm really frustrated. At 8:45, I stated that I was about to leave. She told me she needed a couple more mins, which I doubted. I told her I\u2019ll wait in the car, but that I\u2019m leaving without her if she can\u2019t be out by 8:50. At 8:52, there was no sign of her so I drove off. \n\nShe called me 5 mins later crying and apologizing. Then, got angry because she had no other way of getting to school. This meant that she was going to miss all of her classes and not be able to make her shift. I calmly told her that I\u2019m sorry, and we\u2019ll have a proper conversation about this when I get back. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then, and has yet to come home. \n\nI told one of my friends about it and he called me cruel for leaving her stranded, and potentially jeopardizing her job. I also feel like an AH and that I let my frustration get the better of me. At the same time, I\u2019ve given her so many chances to do better, and I didn't want to fail this test. We've been dating for 3 years so far, and I'm scared I might've ruined our relationship.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677043386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118pv9z/aita_for_leaving_my_girlfriend_stranded_and/", "score": 1112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dude I hate being late and if she can't get her shit in gear it's just disrespectful to you. You tried more then enough and she needs to be an adult and understand that there are timelines.

I wasn't trying to call you out, just thought it might be worth providing some more information!", "Same. It struck me odd too that she has no means to reach her university when it is a 15min drive. There has to be a bus or something else, which college doesn't have this?", "Exactly my thoughts. For me it is pre-planning all those last-second papers for university, having to do lists for everything and every time, fighting against tjoughts that drift away... It's a struggle but I think one can be proud about those small achievements", "Nta", "Looking at the pattern of her getting ready it looks like she\u2019s been manipulating the schedule and pushing it back further and further.

If this were me I would deserve it (and I'd suck it up and pay for an Uber).", "If she calls back, dump her ass.

I strongly suspect that if you stop waiting for her... leave at exactly 8:40 every day, and no warnings... that she will find a way to be ready in time.  As long as you enforce this.  No more exceptions.  IF she's ready to go at 8:40, she can go with you. If she's not, she can't.\n\nYou've been far more patient with her than I would've been.

BUT if someone is driving me, like my mom sometimes will take me but asks me to be early bc she has a dr apt or something, I get there on time! Your gf can jeopardize her own job, her own classes, whatever she wants... but she doesn't get to put you in the crossfires. There is no excuse.

She\u2019s inconsiderate and selfish.", "Nta. There's being cruel and There's being a doormat. You found yourself stepping away from the doormat. Honestly you were nice waiting so much extra.\n\nMight have been better to leave when you said you would so if she waited 5 minutes to know you were gone, you mightve been able to turn back for her, but she dug her own grave", "NTA You didn't leave her stranded or make her miss her classes or work. She did that all on her own. I honestly don't understand why she is mad at you, you should be mad at her.   Your friend makes no sense either. Since you have the only car, you would think that she would be making every effort to catch a ride with you. Why can't she get ready on time? Someone in the comments suggested you stop giving her rides, left her figure out how to get herself to class. Do you think that is necessary?", "NTA you went above and beyond.", "NTA. She literally has NOT been trying. Trying looks like laying out your outfit the night before. Trying looks like having breakfast prepped and ready to go in fridge. Trying looks like getting up 20 mins earlier if you KNOW you're consistently late.\n\nIf you kept accommodating her, it'd get to a regular point where you wouldn't leave until 8:55-9:05 AM. Your GF is lucky you've been understanding for so long... but from now on, have a set time to leave, and STICK WITH IT. \n\nThere's this magical thing called Uber- your GF can eat the cost and learn to be more considerate of other people's time. \n\nSend her this post OP.

She can't keep making you late, especially when you tell her you have a test.", "You are NOT the asshole. She is.\n\nThis is literally effecting your schooling, but she doesn\u2019t care, which shows how inconsiderate and selfish she is. If she didn\u2019t want to miss class or her shift, she should have been ready. You told her multiple times. You even waited two minutes after you said you would leave. All actions have consequences. She needed this lesson. Do not allow her to make you feel bad\u2014or anyone else. You did everything right. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin this relationship. She did.

I would be upset about someone else making me late and not be as patient as you have been. You are being considerate by offering her a ride but she also needs to be respectful and follow your rules.

It can for some people, but not everyone.\n\nA short (details changed) description of ways I've seen it fail:\n\nDay 1 - alarm set for when you need to leave. You were not standing around with shoes and coat and bag onbehen alarm went off. You miss your ride by the time you're ready to walk out the door.\n\nDay 2 - alarm set for 5 minutes before hand. Small scramble, but it works. Yay! That night you deliberately set your stuff out. This is a novel task for you, so your brain doesn't gloss over it.\n\nDay 3 - you spring into action when the alarm goes off and feel smugly and virtuously early when you beat your ride to the vehicle, then mildly annoyed as you stand in the cold waiting for them (it was probably less than a minute, but you're not sure)\n\nDays 4-6 - you start forgetting or procrastinating parts of your night before routine, because your brain is a bastard/you're thinking about an argument at work/ you got distracted. Mornings become rushed\n\nDay 7 - you set your alarm for 15 minutes before go time. It works\n\nDays 8-12 - you're getting tired of standing around in your coat waiting for your partner, and frustrated because youcan't *do* anything because you're in \"waiting to leave\" mode\n\nDay 13 - you meant to set your alarm to 10 minutes before but you transposed the numbers and it doesn't go off until 10 minutes after your ride left.\n\nDay 14-18 - you go back to 15 minutes early, but no longer spring into action when it goes off. You can read one more page/finish this comment/ go pee and *then* get ready\n\nDay 19 - you miss your ride because the alarm goes off, you go to the bathroom, and get distracted on reddit while pooping\n\nDay 20 - you decide to do a 20 minute alarm AND a 5 minute alarm. This works for a while\n\nDay 25 - you start automatically shutting off your alarms without thinking about it, since you know there will be more. This ends about how you would expect.\n\nNot everyone with adhd/executive functioning issues/time blindness is thecsame - for some people, alarms can be helpful - which is why most of us with phones and punctuality issues  try it at some point! But some of us have had to work out different solutions, which are, frankly, often also very annoying for both the person with adhd and anyone around them.", "Same!", "I handle my ADHD the same way, with multiple phone alarms. I usually set three reminders for each event (usually 1 hr, 6 hours, and 1 day). I also have a whiteboard weekly calendar. \n\nI have a feeling that if OP enforces his 8:40am boundary, GF will either figure it out or find another way to get to school. But I don't think OP should keep setting himself on fire to keep his GF warm..."]}
