I told him this because a few years ago when I was still living with my dad she caused a big argument and forced me to move out. I find her very controlling of my dad and manipulative. She\u2019s also completely unable to be polite or even civil with me around and as a result I didn\u2019t see my dad for almost a year. Ever since we started talking again things haven\u2019t been the same. For context me and my dad were very close prior to all of this and he had made me feel safe after having lived for 10 years with my mum and her abusive partner who controlled all of our lives and hurt my mum infront of me.\n\nAfter my baby was born despite me asking my dad to not involve his girlfriend he did anyway. Constantly bringing presents that she picked for the baby and trying to give me advice she had for me when I didn\u2019t ask for advice. I let it slide because I didn\u2019t want to start an argument but then he asked to introduce her to my baby. I politely told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. He then asked why not he would be there. It was at that point that I realised that he wasn\u2019t planning on me being there. This was a step too far for me. I messaged him later that day to say I was sorry if it upset him but I was not comfortable with him taking my newborn baby to meet someone who not only has no relationship we me but actively has a problem with me and hasn\u2019t even met my partner.\n\nHe has taken this very personally. Up until this point he had come to visit without her and kept everything separate. He\u2019s now hasn\u2019t seen us in months and said that if he comes to visit us he will be bringing her and if we turn them away then we are done. I tried meeting with her on my own to try and put a line under things and move forwards but she claimed she was just there to mediate for my dad (who wasn\u2019t present) and we didn\u2019t get anywhere and as expected she went back to him and twisted things I said. As a side note he hid this relationship for on me and my sibling for 12 years before they moved in together so she is practically a stranger to me and all I\u2019ve seen of her is a manipulative woman who doesn\u2019t seem to want my dad to have any kind of relationship with me what so ever.\n\nSince everything kicked off again he has asked how the baby is maybe 3 or 4 times in about 3 months. He\u2019s not seen us or spoken to me on the phone in that time. I\u2019ve now told him that if there isn\u2019t a relationship with me or my partner then there is no access to our baby.

There was also another incident last year when I was going through miscarriage. I was an emotional wreck at the time and had seen something posted on social media that looked to me as though she had given away something I had given to my dad as a birthday present (she had packed up a bunch of his sentimental things when I moved out in my boxes to get rid of them before) I was mistaken and it turned out she had bought the same thing for her daughter not given away my dads however because she decided to complain to her daughter about me instead of giving me a little slack for being mistaken and her daughter then sent me a shitty message demanding I apologise to her, her mum and my dad I got defensive and didn\u2019t apologise (I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m an asshole for that one)", "I agree that OP has that right and maybe even the responsibility to not let people she\u2019s not comfortable with around her infant! \nI do think that you need to prepare yourself for the possibility that you will lose the relationship with your dad because of this!

I'll give you my own personal example as I dunno if it might help, but it can give you my point of veiw I suppose.\n\nMy step dad was abusive. After I moved out, I was genuinely considering cutting all contact with him, however that would mean that I wouldn't be able to have my mom in my life. So...I established boundaries. And whenever he crosses those boundaries... I just get up and leave. Then when he calms down, I make it clear that he doesn't get to do that, and then I wait a while before I see them again. The more he crosses my boundaries, the less time they get to see me. I am good about communicating my boundaries, and I am always polite when he crosses it. I say \"Hey, I have asked you to please not do that. It hurts me when you do that. Please stop.\" If he insists then I go \"Okay then I'm leaving\". If my mom gets upset by me leaving I say \"I created a healthy boundary. He has chosen to ignore it.\" and then just leave. I also am good about saying \"You do not get to talk to me like I'm a child. I am an adult, I deserve to be treated like one\". So I've now limited contact to about once a month, and my dad has gotten better about not crossing my boundaries. Because he knows it makes my mom happy to see me, and she won't get to if he's a dick. \n\nIt's up to you if you want to try and come up with a similar sort of situation. But she needs to be on the same page when it comes to respect and boundaries. You could easily say something like \"We both have had issues with each other. I fully acknowledge that. And for the things I have done to upset you I apologize. I care about my dad, and I know you do to. I want to set some boundaries, and I think you should too. Let's come up with a way for both of us to feel comfortable with each other as best as we can, if only for my dad's sake.\" Then maybe you, your partner, your dad, and his girlfriend can sit down and talk about how you can work with each other so that you and her don't fight, but your dad is still able to be in his grandchild's life. Feel free to throw that out the window if you want. You don't owe this woman anything. But I think it would weigh heavily on your mind if you had to cut out your dad completely. This may be a way for you to own your own part of this feud, while also maybe coming up with a solution that would be beneficial for everyone. But this won't work unless she is also willing to own her part, and to at least try.", "Sorry, that was my bad - I thought wife when you said girlfriend.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think your dad is acting irrationally so you have to stop expecting him to act \"normal\" and just set boundaries. \n\nThis is what I have to tell myself when I'm dealing with my dad. He refused to vaccinate when it came out (or since) so we didn't let him visit. I was trying to protect myself and my family the best way I knew how. I wasn't mad at him, I just set what I thought was a reasonable boundary. He freaked out and made into me not loving him and him not being welcome in our home, yadda yadda. At that point, I realized he was being overly emotional and irrational so I could not reason with him and, instead, had to be a broken record about the boundary. So while your situation is different, I can empathize with what you're going through.\n\nIt sucks. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA . You can tell your dad that until you have a relatively cordial relationship with his gf she's not coming anywhere near your child.\n\nYou are willing to work with her on this ( therapy sessions Together) but this is your hill to die on. He refuses or she does/doesn't want to put the effort in - too bad , go low contact with him as well. \n\nYour baby comes first and a person like her who doesn't like nor respect you shouldn't be around your child.\n\nHonestly from your post and comments I don't think it will happen but you can try", "You said, you don\u2019t know why it still bothers you but I can tell you: because you love your Dad & wants him in your & the child\u2019s life.\n\nBut sometimes \u201elove\u201c isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s the reason why I asked you, to think what YOU want! \n\nI get it, that you want your Dad in your life but he proofed more then once (from what you are saying in your post) that he isn\u2019t choosing you, unfortunately\u2026 \n\nSo step back, take your time (<- that\u2019s really important!) and think about yourself. \n\nI could tell you what you should do or how it will be in the future (maybe) with your Dad but that\u2019s not the right way.

I did try to have that kind of conversation with her, that\u2019s why I went to meet her. However she started the conversation right off the bat saying there was nothing in the conversation for her and that she was simply there to mediate for my dad. \n\nI get the impression that she doesn\u2019t like not being in complete control and because I\u2019m quite free willed she doesn\u2019t like that about me. I could be wrong but I believe that this has all started because she is making my dad feel bad for having a separate relationship with me because she can\u2019t be there to see what is happening and hear what is said. \n\nThey both seem to think I\u2019m trying to break them up but I couldn\u2019t care less if they are together or not what I care about is my baby and keeping my baby out of it all. I feel I tried to do the mature thing and meet with her and find a way to move past things so we could start working towards a relationship and then eventually allow her around my baby when I felt more comfortable around her myself but it was apparent she doesn\u2019t want to do that and was again using the conversation we had as an opportunity to twist my words and make me look like I\u2019m trying to break them up or something? \n\nDo you think this is a total lost cause?", "That is a very fair statement and you\u2019re right I need to think what\u2019s best for me. Thank you.", "No, I don't. I would just take the high ground here if I were you. I'd be honest with them and say. \"I want us all to have a relationship, and I am willing to sit down and discuss our issues. To try and work out our problems and get to a place where we can still see each other and enjoy the time we spend together. But I need (dad's girlfriend) to be willing to work with me and to talk to me. I don't think I'm wrong for wanting to set healthy boundaries. We have our issues, and we've both said some hurtful things to each other. I'll own that and I am sorry. But my hurt matters too, and I want to make sure that I don't hurt her again in the future. I can't do that if I don't know what hurt her most, and what I can avoid in the future. I just ask that she do the same for me.\" If you say that to your dad and her, I'm pretty sure he's going to take your side on this. What the hell is he going to say? \"No you shouldn't have healthy boundaries and you shouldn't communicate with my girlfriend? You should just give in to all her demands and let her say whatever she wants about you?\" If he does, then maybe you *should* cut them both out of your life cause that's not cool.", "I think you should stop beating yourself up and overthinking it all.
