She refused. I suggest i can go do a walk on my own and come back later, she gets mad i'm 'ditching' her in the hotel. I suggest meeting her down the boardwalk so she can uber to the end and i'll walk to meet her so I don't miss out on the shops along the way, and she gets mad and says she'll just stay in the hotel then if i won't uber with her. If i do go without her, i come back to the silent treatment.\n\nMy mom (63) is aging, out of shape, has bad knees and can't walk far. I've (39) been trying to get her to go to Florida for years but she's always said no. I have been solo travelling lately and love it. I booked myself a trip to FL and she decided she wanted to come this time. I said ok, as long as she's ok with me doing my own thing sometimes because her mobility doesn't let her do the same things. I'm very active. She agreed. I should mention my mom has a big codependency problem and doesn't do anything alone. She won't even go to the store alone if she can help it. My dad ia boring so she relies on her kids for company.\n\nShe mentioned tonight she found a local rideshare service like Uber we could take. I said cool, but for anything walkable, i'm walking/running and I'll meet her there. (We're staying ON the beach. I can walk to most places in 20 mins otherwise ya, we can drive or uber). She immediately got annoyed with me and said if i'm not going with her in the car, she'll just stay in the hotel room. I asked her why it upsets her that I want to walk, and she just says i'm ditching her already and we haven't even gotten there. I told her that I like to get my activity in and if she wants to stay at the hotel instead, thats silly but so be it. I suggested a scooter rental. She then called me bossy. Wtf? \n\nI suspect she feels guilty she physically can't keep up, and also her fear of literally doing anything alone. But.. i'm almost 40 and this isn't my problem. I had hoped we'd have a nice trip but i'm already regretting it and angry i'm going to waste my time inside a hotel. I don't want to fight with her the whole time either. \n\nAITA for wanting to walk as much as I can on vacation and expecting my mom to take uber or just stay at the hotel if she doesn't?", "created_utc": 1701832137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bubpe/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_take_an_ubertrolly/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's bound to be pretty common in Florida. \n\nIt would also mean that the two of you can enjoy going for a walk with her alongside on her scooter and then you can both have a look at the shops and other places won't be out of reach for her. It would be a much better experience for you both if she agrees to that. Obviously if you go out in the evening to a restaurant you can share an uber there and back.", "I am 64 with really bad knees. I\u2019m also a little round. I hate walking. I will fly, take an Uber, a train or drive (less than 2 hours) by myself (I prefer a person in the car to talk to, to drive a longer distance). On a recent trip (about a month before) I fell and hurt my knee, my daughter lives in a walkable city. Even though it was a relatively short distance (less than a mile) I knew I couldn\u2019t walk it. We drove. I was thankful. I could have walked it but would have been in unbearable pain for days afterwards. I didn\u2019t mind my daughter walking to places and leaving me at her house. If I really wanted to go I would have figured it out. You are not the ass for wanting to walk/run\u2026but you are the ass in not realizing how painful it can be for your mom.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand all these comments, it\u2019s like no one has ever travelled before. Walking around town can be a huge part of an experience, it\u2019s not you going out for exercise. If your mom doesn\u2019t want to use a scooter to do that, that is her choice. If she doesn\u2019t want to Uber to meet you, that is her choice. This is your trip that she is joining, she does not have to come.\n\nMy mom loves walking, my dad struggles. Often she walks to a cafe and my dad drives to meet her. They get to spend time together and also do their own thing, it\u2019s great.", "I'm going to give you a perspective of someone with mobility issues.\n\nI injured myself back in the winter and I now require gait aids to mobilize. I used to go to the gym several times a week and walk home from work every day (5km). Now I can't even grocery shop by myself. I've been told by my specialist that I may never get better.\n\nWhen people do to me what you are planning on doing, it makes me feel worse about myself. When I'm waiting for the elevator when everyone else takes the stairs, or I'm standing by myself waiting for someone to return because whoever I was with didn't want to slow down for me to go with them, it gives me plenty of time to think: I'm a burden; I'm not fun to be around; people are annoyed by me; how I may never have the freedom I once had. I work hard every day to maintain what physical abilities I still have and try to stay positive but those times when I'm left alone BECAUSE of my physical limitations, that's when I start to think these things.\n\nOP, I get where you're coming from. I really do. You want to live your best life. But as someone who now struggles daily, just slow down for your mom. Please.", "YTA - Go running in the morning/10k step walk after dinner or midday solo for an hour\n\nSpend time with your Mother.  You are 39 and talking like a gd teenager.", "YTA, you sound extremely inflexible. When you go on a trip with someone with mobility issues/a disability, some things will have to be adjusted. You've been wanting her to travel and now are basically making her feel shamed and left out for aging and having mobility issues when she agrees. \n\nIt's not like this is your one trip of the decade, you say you travel all the time. Taking one trip that isn't up to your personal physical activity standards won't kill you.", "Rare take but NTA. Mobility options like the scooter were available and offered. She chose not to use them, and wants the Uber instead. This choice skips all the shops you want to visit, that she doesn\u2019t care about visiting. If it takes the same amount of time to Uber to the end destination as it does to walk, you get there at relatively the same time. This shouldn\u2019t even be an issue.", "NTA\nThis sounds like what my mom would do. Everyone on vacation had to be together the whole time. I put my foot down several years ago. I'm not missing out because someone else doesn't want to go. You'll be together most of the time anyway.", "NTA. I've been on vacations with people like this, and it SUCKS. Ubers are expensive, and I'm not calling one to only go half a mile. \ud83d\ude44 You planned this specific vacation as a solo trip, and your mom decided to come along. She doesn't get to dictate how you travel.", "YTA - you have been trying to get her to travel, she finally did, and you cant even simply share a car with her tonight? \n\nThis isn\u2019t codependency, this is you refusing to meet her halfway. This was just one ride and not her saying you cant walk anywhere the whole trip.", "YTA\n\nRide in the Uber with your mom. Laugh and talk in the Uber and soak up all the mom time and make the happy memories. Don\u2019t make your mom feel awkward and crappy about her mobility. \n\nAt the risk of sounding morbid, one day you won\u2019t ever have the chance to ride with her again.", "NAH\n\nYour aging mom is probably suffering from anxiety.  You're not just a companion, you are emotional support.   She probably needs it.    Your previous negotiation would be that you would do your own thing \"sometimes\".  That's poor negotiation on both of your parts.    Some better communication and patience and you two should be able to work this out.  \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. She invited herself on your vacation, and you made it clear that you wanted to be active. If she\u2019s like my mom was, she will just sit in the hotel and mope while trying to make you feel guilty. Her issues are not your problem. Spend some time with her, but she\u2019s a grownup and needs to act like one.", "NTA\n\nI have an aunt like this, it\u2019s infuriating. She claims she\u2019s left out a lot, and that we\u2019re all ableist, but she\u2019s a miserable person of we\u2019re not all miserable with her. I\u2019ve tried what you tried: to include her but make her responsible for her own Ubers. (I\u2019ve even paid for them) but no\u2026.. if I don\u2019t get in the car and miss all the sidewalk shops and experiences to just roam and explore I\u2019m an asshole. \n\nI have two working kneecaps. I\u2019m hitting the beach. Peace out.", "NTA it\u2019s not like OP is going to Disney where there\u2019s a monorail or other mobility vehicles on site.  When you go to a popular beach area that\u2019s built as a pedestrian friendly destination taking a car/Uber isn\u2019t feasible.  Most of these types of tourist spots rent mobility scooters or other scooters to effectively get around on the boardwalk.  Most of the shops and activities are only accessible from the boardwalk so taking a car/Uber is only reasonable if you\u2019re going to a restaurant that\u2019s not on the pier or boardwalk.  Mom can\u2019t walk for long distances so a scooter would be the best bet for her to enjoy the trip.  OP not wanting an Uber/car is because the things she wants to visit aren\u2019t accessible by car/Uber.  OP has explained this to her mother but all she gets is I\u2019ll just stay in the room.  That\u2019s the guilt trip of the century it has nothing to do with OP wanting to walk everywhere but it\u2019s expected for the destination.  Before committing to the trip with OP mom should\u2019ve looked up the area and the hotel.  She would\u2019ve seen that this trip wasn\u2019t going to be what she expected, unless she jus5 wanted to hang out at the beach all day.  That wasn\u2019t the plan for OP she wanted to take in some of the area and the boardwalk.  I myself hate going to the beach and just literally just go to the beach.  I want to see other things and usually taking a car and finding parking takes most of the day away so walking is always the best mode of transportation.  If I do plan on having a beach day you can bet I will have booked the umbrella and beach chairs ahead of time.  I\u2019m not dragging all that stuff with me on vacation, especially when I have to take a plane to get there.  Mom is being difficult and not compromising the scooter can be rented for the entire trip and they allowed in the shops so it\u2019s a win - win situation.", "ESH\n\nI was firmly in the Y-T-A camp until she shot down the mobility scooter option. My parents tend to get clingy on vacation too; I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being someplace unfamiliar or the influx of people or what, so I was inclined to say that her not wanting to be alone is just something to deal with.\n\nShe agreed to alone time and now she doesn\u2019t want to do that. I kind of feel like based upon what you\u2019ve shared about her that you knew that was an empty promise she couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t uphold. If she relies on you and her other kids for regular companionship, I expect that to ratchet up for travel, not to grow milder.\n\nYes she\u2019s your mom. Yes she\u2019s handicapped. Yes accommodations have to be made in those situations, and you have done plenty; you\u2019ve moved your hotel location and ceded the freedom of your own room. She can\u2019t be bothered to use a scooter? It\u2019s Uber or nothing? That\u2019s asinine and there\u2019s no excuse for that except her being prideful and just because someone\u2019s old doesn\u2019t mean their progeny should blindly accept their stubborn inconveniences.\n\nI\u2019d honestly tell her that she needs to compromise with you or else she should stay home. There\u2019s absolutely a place to meet in the middle here; Ubering to/from the boardwalk would be fine if she\u2019d then agree to the scooter so that you can do your shops.", "NTA. I\u2019m 65, and your mom can get herself from A-B by herself.  You aren\u2019t saying you don\u2019t want to do things with her, just that she not keep you from walking.  This was your trip, not hers. Her unwillingness to let you walk early, to go anywhere on her own, or even use a scooter, is ridiculous.", "NTA - I live this same scenario, so I get it. \n\nSounds like you have tried to give suggestions so you can be together and still get air and exercise. She probably doesn't want to use the scooter because it will make her look old and disabled. My 80+ mom won't use her cane because it makes her look old. \n\nStop having conversations about the trip and she will either use the scooter or stay in the hotel. \n\nCould you start the trip by just short walks on the boardwalk and move up to longer walks?", "Comments here are wild!!! NTA. If you have a mother like this you\u2019d understand how annoying it is. If OP hadn\u2019t invited mum, it\u2019s a problem. She did with caveats, it\u2019s a problem: she does her walking anyway it\u2019s a problem:\n\nThe only way this goes well for OP is to do everything her mother does. And that\u2019s miserable especially if it\u2019s your one big holiday of the year, and it\u2019s expensive", "NTA. I have had this issue with aging family members. They invited themselves on a trip where walking was the plan then refused to take alternate transportation by themselves forcing everyone to accommodate them. Saying, hey mom why don\u2019t you Uber and I\u2019ll\nwalk and meet you is a pretty good compromise in my book.", "NTA - this is your trip that you planned to go on solo. Your mom asked if she could come along, and you said yes as long as she understood you wouldn't always be together. \n\nYou're not telling her she can't take an Uber, you're saying you'd prefer to walk as that's what you do on your vacations. She can either deal with that or not go.", "YTA, and your comments make it seem worse.   You travel a lot and have been trying to get her to go on a trip with you.   Actually let that happen.    Yes it's ridiculous to say you'll walk to where you're going when she can't.", "NTA\nAll these people are absolutely delusional.

Honestly at this point you might just be better off uninviting your mom from the trip all together.", "NTA. I'm 65 and can't walk as far as my kids. When we go places together, I'll sometimes meet them at a destination by taking a cab/uber. What's the big deal?

That way she doesn\u2019t have to choose between walking or riding alone, and you can easily stop the golf cart and not miss the little shops along the way.\n\nI, personally, don\u2019t like taking an Uber by myself, it\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable.  I\u2019d much rather ride with the person with whom I am traveling.", "this is reddit, people aren\u2019t going to give you any sympathy for being human. yes, maybe you SHOULD take a couple of ubers with her, but it\u2019s not wrong for you to want to walk and spend your vacation the way you want to. your mom is just along for the ride and if she wants to be difficult the entire time, then just don\u2019t mind it. grey rock her. \n\ngoogle \u201cgrey rock method\u201d. don\u2019t let her manipulate you.\n\nNTA.", "I'm baffled by all the y t a responses.

That's hard to do when your suggestions are dismissed and the guilt trip of \"I will just stay in the room\" starts.   \n\nWhere others see you being inflexible, I see you trying but being met by the dreaded guilt trip.   My mother was a master of the guilt trip, so I get it.  \n\nI understand your frustration. But, do you understand hers?  She's only 63.  She's not that old and now had mobility issues AND doesn't like doing things alone.  Perhaps she feels trapped?  \n\n\nI'm going to offer a totally different solution.  \n\nOffer mom the option of this current vacation or a different vacation that she can help plan.   Maybe you could include your sister and make it a girls getaway.  A spa trip?  \n\nPlan a vacation with mom that will be doable for her limited mobility.   Maybe just a long weekend.  Involve your mom in the planning.", "NTA.  Your mom is asking you to not walk a boardwalk and miss all the shops in a beach town, that\u2019s the #1 thing to do!

A lot of these commenters are delusional.... \"You can't walk because I don't want to spend 5 mins in an Uber without you\" is the unreasonable side of this.

I've started working out and have built my core to where I am not in as much pain when I walk. Knees still hurt though. I also concentrate on lifting my feet and watching the area ahead of where I walk because if I hit a hole or a rock, it can shift my knees and down I go. Do you know how scary it is to be older, alone and fall? Getting up is a major undertaking. Never mind the few minutes it takes to absorb the fact you've fallen and run through your body inventory to see what hurts and what hurts A LOT. (I broke my shoulder in a fall, alone in my home. NOT FUN.) We can't do what we used to. I thank GOD for my daughter who lets me walk at my pace, sit if I need to and generally cares for me and about me.

You want to experience the place while your Mom wants to see it and have select experiences (at places of her/your) choice. \n\nI do believe that there is room for compromise, you might have to give me some clarity though. If you are willing to you could:\n- Pay for your Dad to come on the trip as well or invite him along. You could spend the mornings OR the afternoons with your parents but not both so you still get time to explore. \n- You could create a list of activities, including how far the walk is, if they have scooters that she can rent to ride (if she\u2019s not willing to get in a wheelchair/scooter at all this isn\u2019t gonna work). You can both ride share there ( I know you don\u2019t want to but this doesn\u2019t have to be an everyday thing, maybe every other day). \n- You could ensure that you stay in an area with lots of activities within a 10 minute walk/ride. \n\nThose are just a few. It seems to me like you want the trip to go 100% your way and unfortunately if you want your Mom to come you\u2019ll have to make some concessions. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this to be harsh but if you want a \u2018good\u2019 trip and don\u2019t mind harming the relationship with your Mom (which I don\u2019t advise but it is an option) then you could always I invite her and say that you think you both have different trips in mind, and you aren\u2019t suitable travel partners for this trip. Maybe in the future you could  plan something for the two of you that\u2019s more aligned with her abilities. \n\nI get it, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to miss the sights for my Grandma (we don\u2019t have the best relationship) but for my Mom or Dad I\u2019d miss everything just to spend time with them in the car. \n\nJust and idea: they have tours available on some trains where you just see the sights and don\u2019t have to leave the train.

I've (39) been trying to get her to go to Florida for years but she's always said no. I have been solo travelling lately and love it. I booked myself a trip to FL and she decided she wanted to come this time. I said ok, as long as she's ok with me doing my own thing sometimes because her mobility doesn't let her do the same things. I'm very active. She agreed. I should mention my mom has a big codependency problem and doesn't do anything alone. She won't even go to the store alone if she can help it. My dad ia boring so she relies on her kids for company.\n\nShe mentioned tonight she found a local rideshare service like Uber we could take. I said cool, but for anything walkable, i'm walking/running and I'll meet her there. (We're staying ON the beach. I can walk to most places in 20 mins otherwise ya, we can drive or uber). She immediately got annoyed with me and said if i'm not going with her in the car, she'll just stay in the hotel room. I asked her why it upsets her that I want to walk, and she just says i'm ditching her already and we haven't even gotten there. I told her that I like to get my activity in and if she wants to stay at the hotel instead, thats silly but so be it. I suggested a scooter rental. She then called me bossy. Wtf? \n\nI suspect she feels guilty she physically can't keep up, and also her fear of literally doing anything alone. But.. i'm almost 40 and this isn't my problem. I had hoped we'd have a nice trip but i'm already regretting it and angry i'm going to waste my time inside a hotel. I don't want to fight with her the whole time either. \n\nAITA for wanting to walk as much as I can on vacation and expecting my mom to take uber or just stay at the hotel if she doesn't?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You've been wanting her to go to Florida *with* you for years (your words), and now she is willing to do so, but you're not treating this like it is a trip *with* your mom, for you to do *together*.

My mom was 62 when she passed in September, and while we never had a good relationship,  I have *so many* regrets. You have a chance to spend 5 days with your mother, just the 2 of you.

Have aches and pains and body parts that don't work like they used too.  When accepting invitations from anyone, I take all those things into account so as not to ruin their time.\n\nYou are paying for everything and all you are asking for in return is for her to Uber where she can't walk, while you walk there.  That is not unreasonable.  You're mom is afraid, not stupid.  Show her (and be patient) how to use Uber as I guarantee she doesn't know how and is too embarrassed to ask you to show her.

They're basically saying I hate my mother because i'm trying to get some exercise where I can (especially since i can't at home right now due to winter and brutal climate) while also accomodating and noting her mobility issues so she can still be involved.

I can't leave her in the hotel alone either because she gets pissy. I'll go do my own thing, come back and she'll give me the silent treatment.  So i'm damned if i do, damned if I don't.

So if we want to do lunch, great, i will go do my thing and either come back and we can go together, or you can meet me at the lunch place. Which is where the uber came in.

So i thought a compromise was she can uber to wherever the end goal is, and i can meet her there if its a quick walkable distance. She said no, she'll just stay at the hotel if i won't go with her. I said thats silly and a waste of vacation then, and i'm getting shit on for not appreciating my mom for some reason lol.", "Thanks. I knew this about her long before but i do want to travel a but with her before she really can't. \n\nI'm not complaining about travelling wirh her. I'm complaining that I can't seem to find a happy solution because no matter what I do, it means i have to sacrifice everything i want to look at which defeats ME even going. This isn't a trip FOR her. Its WITH her.", "TY, good advice. Safety isn't even the concern! I know the area well and won't put her in an unsafe ride lol. I would love if she'd get a scooter and just ride along with me. Maybe i'll book one and hope she can be convinced.", "So this was a vacation I take regularly. I told her she's welcome to come but that i'll be doing some things on my own. She agreed. And now takes that back and expects to be together 24/7. \n\nNo matter what trip we take, no matter where, its like this.  As i stated, she is codependent.", "Thats what i try to tell her too. That uber will literally drop her off a ways from the end goal anyway so she's gonna have to walk (or rent a scooter which she doesn't want to.) So i said she's welcome to uber to the closest place to the destination, but that i'm going to walk, for so many reasons. Traffic is bumper to bumper on weekends and there is nowhere for uber to stop unless its a ways away from the pier. \n\nWe have a rental car for everything else thats far. But we are staying on the sand. You cannot get any closer to the boardwalks than that but if a store we want to go to is a 15 min walk down the boardwalk, she wants to uber.", "Well no, i feel like an asshole because i feel bad she feels bad. But she feels bad because she can't do the things she wishes her body can do. She'll tell me not to worry about her and to go do whatever, but then when i do, she pouts and gets mad that she's being left alone.  So i feel like an asshole no matter what i do unless i'm glued to her hip 24/7, which i'm tired of.\n\nThis is more than just the trip. This has been many years in the making, pre-mobility issues, because she's been dependent on me for her 'entertainment' for a very long time due to her unhappy marriage and me being choosing to be single while my sister is busy with a family.

To be told i have to stay with her in the hotel or go in the uber with her, otherwise i face days of silent treatment and moodiness isn't right. \n\nI've suggested a scooter, per my post. She refuses. I suggested meeting at the location we want to go to, so I can walk there and still see things along the way, she gets mad and says she'll just stay at the hotel. If i say ok, and still go, she gets mad I didn't stay at the hotel.", "You're literally telling me this woman needs a wheelchair when she doesn't, don't think i'm the massive AH.  She doesn't even want a scooter, what the hell makes you think she'll want a wheelchair? She's not even disabled, she has difficulty walking for long periods because of her knee. She's not some crippled woman who will break if the wind blows her over.\n\nYou're assuming a lot of things about her mobility for clearly not reading anything i've written. I hope you're not actually a nurse because you enjoy ruining peoples physical independence by forcing them in wheelchairs.", "And you're ignoring that this was my trip i had planned, told her she's welcome to come but that i'd be doing my own thing sometimes, to which she agreed.

You're an asshole.", "Make her ride the scooter like a good son", "My friend. You knew your mothers limitations before this started. You knew the physical limitations of her disability. You knew her psychological limitations that lead her to not want to be alone. You knew both of those things and you still agreed to go on a trip with her.

There\u2019s nothing magical about Florida that will suddenly make her comfortable on her own. \n\nI\u2019m the same age as you, and you sound really childish to me. When you go on a trip by yourself, you get to do whatever you want. When you agree to travel with someone else, you are giving up some level of self determination during the trip. That\u2019s simply how traveling with other people works, and has always worked throughout the ages. If you can\u2019t accept that, you need to stick to solo vacations in the future.", "That was snarky. She doesn't travel, can't walk well, and hates doing things solo.

You can always go again by yourself and walk your heart out", "I mean yeah, from everything you wrote in this post and your comments I'm not sure why you're SO annoyed with an easily predicted outcome.

I understand. Her pouting in the hotel room would make me want to leave her right there and continue to do my own thing. My mom loves to walk and really almost needs it every day.

She probably just doesnt realize what it is really like.  Once you are there I imagine she will be more receptive to the scooter idea.
