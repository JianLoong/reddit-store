I would like to again reiterate I really love my wife and everyone has their flaws and this may be some attachment issues. After hearing all your advice I had an open conversation with my wife. At first she was defensive but she heard me out. She was crying a lot, understandably this is also a difficult time for her and she apologised and said she would make amends. I'm not sure whether she understands me or she's saying this to make me happy but I think we are headed in the right direction. Sorry i could reply to all your comments but thank you for your kind words and support. It's not easy being a good spouse and I often doubt my own actions and words. At the end of the day I love this woman and we are going to work together to create a happy marriage and perhaps that means I need to be a bit more honest and open even in situations where I'm scared to hurt her. I'm having a surgery to remove the tumour and there's a good chance that it's benign. Thank you all again.\n\nIm (26M) have been married to my wife (27F) for less than a year. Recently we found out that I have a brain tumour and it has thrown our life upside down. My wife is extremely attached to her family and for most of our marriage she has been hurting our relationship to make her family happy. \nAfter I found out about my health condition I've been wanting to spend more time with my family. My wife's relationship with my family has always been turbulent and she feels like they don't give her the emotional support needed in this situation. \nMy family have a \"lets not talk about it\" approach to problems and rather spend time trying to cheer me up. \nRecently she felt their attempts to distract me with their new TV was insensitive. My family apologised to my wife after having a discussion on how it felt like she wasn't being emotionally supported. \nMy wife feels like her family care about me more so therefore I should spend time with them equally. \nWe got into an argument and I told her I rather spend more time with my family because it's comforting for me.\nShe's currently not speaking to me and she said I'm villainising her.
