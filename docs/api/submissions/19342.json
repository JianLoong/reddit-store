Since we had our daughter, my dog (3yo Corgi) has been super anxious and whining at my feet/trying to jump up on me whenever I'm holding our daughter. She has jumped on our daughters legs a few times and made the baby cry but out of being spooked, not hurt. During changing, feedings or even just holding her. She doesn't do it with my wife, only me. So, she's basically experiencing jealousy over our daughter and her anxiety surrounding the issue is leading to a lot of unfavorable behaviors. Such as whining nonstop whenever I'm around the baby. I don't ever just let it happen. I take safety measures and what not. \n\nBut my wife was diagnosed with Postpartum Depression 3 weeks ago and it's slowly getting worse and she's full on blaming the dog. Says that she can't even trust to let me hold the baby anymore because of my dog and she doesn't want my dog anywhere near our daughter because of her \"resource guarding\". To a point of her telling everyone that I'm choosing the dog over the safety of our kid AND her comfortability. It's been causing fights left and right because now I can't even hold our daughter without my wife immediately at my side and pushing the dog away from me and my daughter OR putting her in her kennel. She says that since I refuse to reprimand the dog or try \"helping\" the dogs anxiety, the dog is not to be anywhere near our kid or near me when I'm holding our kid. \n\nAnyways, yesterday I'm sitting on the couch holding our daughter and my dog jumps up on the couch and lays half on the baby and half on my chest to get to my face while whining. My wife flipped out. She said either the dog goes or her AND our daughter are gone until I get my \"head out of my ass\" and see the issue. I told her I'm not choosing between her and the dog and she can do what she wants. She took that as me choosing the dog. She packed our daughter up and left, won't answer my calls or texts but had her mom text and say \"She's not coming home until that dogs gone. You had the chance to get the animal help and you didn't so the choice is either the dog goes or Bella stays here with your daughter.\" AITA?", "created_utc": 1686268421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144pd04/aita_for_essentially_choosing_my_dog_during_an/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Minimizes his wife's concerns by chalking it up to Postpartum.  Chooses to validate/accept/ignore his dog's behavior/reaction rather than that of his human wife--whose sole concern right now is protecting HIS baby, and is willing to see his wife leave the comfort of her home after destroying her body to give birth to HIS baby just to ensure HIS baby can be in a safe and peaceful place when he won't do the one thing that will make her feel safer.  \n\nSo yeah, I'd say definite candidate for Husband AND Father of the Year here.

The dog is making it clear that it's unhappy with the new addition to the family, and could be a real threat to the baby. \n\n3. You are not recognizing that your role is hard support to your wife and baby - they *need* to be and feel safe and secure right now, for the physical and mental health of both of them..\n\nIt's your job to make sure that her environment meets that standard. The stress and anxiety from the dog are to blame for your wife not feeling that the baby is safe - and therefore *she is right:* the dog is to blame. More to the point: you are to blame for not doing your job to create a safe environment for your baby.", "YTA\n\nAn anxious, jealous dog is a dog that doesn't belong near a newborn.

The weight of even a small dog is enough to smother a child.  And if it lands on the baby the wrong way, it could break a bone, or even the baby's neck, especially while the baby is too small to even support its own head.\n\nAnd you're a parent, now.  Your child needs to come first.\n\nTrain your dog not to jump on people.  And do not leave the dog alone with the baby.  It goes in a different room with the door closed, or in a crate, if a responsible adult isn't right there.\n\nYou're letting it happen.  The dog wound up on top of the baby, again.  Your \"safety measures\" are inadequate.  And you lie when you say you \"won't choose between the dog and the baby\" because you're choosing the dog over the baby's safety.", "YTA. You are risking your daughter's safety because you refuse to train your dog. Every time the dog jumps up on baby and you allow it, you are reinforcing the dog's behaviour.

I'm really glad your wife is a smart woman who isn't going to wait around until your daughter is injured.

Dude, I understand that your dog is important to you, but if the dog is literally interrupting by jumping ON the baby, your wife is right, it's not safe, especially since the baby is only 5 weeks old and doesn't have a developed immune system yet to counteract the germs that a dog jumping on her introduces. Your wife was absolutely right to keep the dog away or in the kennel when you interacted with your daughter. Since you weren't listening, she removed herself and the baby from a blatantly dangerous situation.", "YTA. How hard would it have been to put the dog in another room while you hold your daughter? Your safety measures obviously aren't enough if the dog is still jumping on you/your daughter. You seem to be blaming this on your wife's PPD but she is right that this behavior is unsafe for the baby and it's also clearly not helping with her PPD! She needs less stress not more. \n\nI'm never a fan of getting rid of a pet but why can't you do even something as simple as putting up some baby gates so the dog isn't in the same room while you're holding the baby. Maybe you could bring in a trainer but your wife is understandably at the end of her rope and needs immediate solutions.

For you to consider the height they go to \"jumping\", with respect to your own height, then your dog must be going way high in the air, high enough that it would definitely become an issue for a small child. And, as for the going for the legs, that could be 100% seen as trying to knock the kid down from a logistics and logistical standpoint. Thus, affirming your wife's fears. Trust me on that.

Until the dog has a LOT of training/ redirection, she is not safe around the baby, especially if she is laying on the baby or scaring her. And you are doing nothing to stop the behavior. Your wife isn't wrong to separate the dog from the situation. Your daughter may end up with a fear of dogs if you don't correct the dog's behavior. \n\nBut really.

Since we had our daughter, my dog (3yo Corgi) has been super anxious and whining at my feet/trying to jump up on me whenever I'm holding our daughter. During changing, feedings or even just holding her. She doesn't do it with my wife, only me. So, she's basically experiencing jealousy over our daughter and her anxiety surrounding the issue is leading to a lot of unfavorable behaviors. Such as whining nonstop whenever I'm around the baby. I don't ever just let it happen. I take safety measures and what not. \n\nBut my wife was diagnosed with Postpartum Depression 3 weeks ago and it's slowly getting worse and she's full on blaming the dog. Says that she can't even trust to let me hold the baby anymore because of my dog and she doesn't want my dog anywhere near our daughter because of her \"resource guarding\". To a point of her telling everyone that I'm choosing the dog over the safety of our kid AND her comfortability. It's been causing fights left and right because now I can't even hold our daughter without my wife immediately at my side and pushing the dog away from me and my daughter OR putting her in her kennel. She says that since I refuse to reprimand the dog or try \"helping\" the dogs anxiety, the dog is not to be anywhere near our kid or near me when I'm holding our kid. \n\nAnyways, yesterday I'm sitting on the couch holding our daughter and my dog jumps up on the couch and lays half on the baby and half on my chest to get to my face while whining. My wife flipped out. She said either the dog goes or her AND our daughter are gone until I get my \"head out of my ass\" and see the issue. I told her I'm not choosing between her and the dog and she can do what she wants. She took that as me choosing the dog. She packed our daughter up and left, won't answer my calls or texts but had her mom text and say \"She's not coming home until that dogs gone. You had the chance to get the animal help and you didn't so the choice is either the dog goes or Bella stays here with your daughter.\" AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wow the guy even hates his daughter.", "Yta ...your main concern should be the child. End of story", "\"I don't ever just let it happen\" - Sorry, but... you are. A corgi is not big enough to hurt a baby in your arms. And if you don't train your dog to NOT HURT YOUR KID when you sit down or lay her down, your wife is right to get away from you. A jealous dog can be sooo dangerous. She will soon understand, that it has no consequences for her, when she hurts your child and may go further than \"only\" jumping on her.\n\nAnd it's also not good for the dog. She has to have this feelings and doesn't feel good, because you don't care to train her.\n\n* Your daughter gets hurt\n* Your wife is depressed and feels misunderstood\n* Your dog is sad\n\nThis situation isn't good for ANYBODY but you, because you can sit on your lazy ass now and don't have to worry about anything. YTA\n\nETA: And keep chalking your wifes feelings up to PPD. You are one of the reason she doesn't feel safe. You should be ashamed of yourself. Her PPD is not the origin for her worries. Her hormones and worries are the origin for her PPD. If you keep dismissing her, after her body was ripped open to bear your baby, she will (hopefully) leave you", "YTA my guy.

I have a very well-trained dog that has never once been aggressive towards humans. If he exhibited any of the behaviors OP talked about, no way in hell would I let him on the couch next to the baby. Dogs do not understand everything humans do, dogs can act weird around tiny humans, and even a dog that you'd trust with your life could, on even just a fraction of a percentage of a chance, decide to snap at the tiny human it has had an issue with.\n\nNo fucking way would I let a dog like that put its face right next to a baby. Even if you're almost certain that nothing bad could happen... It could still happen. Better safe than sorry.", "Yeah, I wondered how he could tell if the baby was hurt or \"just\" scared when she cried.", "I appreciate and agree with your comment overall, but feel inclined to point out that birth does not destroy a woman\u2019s body.

Relax.", "Not ones that stop the dog from literally climbing on the baby, so...", "This is my question. OP still gets YTA cause whatever he's doing is not sufficient to stop his dog from getting on top of his newborn, but I'm curious what he thinks are sufficient safety measures", "ALL OF THIS.  Re #2, we had a dog we had to re-home (a rescue helped us find a wonderful home for her with a single older woman who had recently lost her very similar companion) because she would not stop a handful of behaviors that were irritating but at the time didn't seem that dangerous. It took us a solid 9 months to realize that the dog was MISERABLE and anxious with a preschooler and now a new baby, and trying so hard to communicate this to us.  At the time we were going insane because no amount of work with a dog trainer was changing anything, but she wasn't being bad exactly, just constantly letting out these alerting barks and always needing to find my husband -- she preferred us to us all to be together.  It was the second time we had someone else dogsit her at their home that we realized WE were the problem. Anytime she stayed with someone else without children, she was back to her old self.", "I agree so much with the choosing thing (choosing nothing is just allowing bad things to happen without consequence) but I do want INFO on what OP is doing to help the dog? It's implied in the post that OP might be trying but nothing is described??\n\nOP, YTA and I hope you enjoy being a deadbeat dad because you are running for that title.", "I'm not sure the wife has PPD.  \n\nOP isn't describing depression, when he describes the behavior he's calling \"PPD.\"\n\nHe's describing concrete actions to protect the infant from the dog and OP's own negligence of the child's safety.  And righteous and justified anger that he's being reckless with the safety of their child. Finally, concrete and specific action to remove the child from the dangerous household OP has created when he fails to respond to reason.\n\nIt's fairly common for men to dismiss the rational concerns of women as being \"emotional,\"   and their own over-the-top emotion as rational.  This seems to be what is going on.  He's all emotional about his dog, won't even consider that the dog is not safe around the child, to the point of putting their child at risk, and the wife reacts in the only rational way possible, by separating him from the child when he won't act to ensure the child's safety.", "I am a pet person. Letting a dog 'half-lay' on a five week old baby is not the move. Five week old babies aren't even supposed to sleep with pillows in their cradles because they could suffocate. Babies that small are fragile and can't always signal their distress/if they're having problems breathing. That's a terrible idea.\n\nBut honestly, maybe an even worse one is letting a dog that is clearly expressing anxiety around a baby lay next to the baby. Some dogs act weird around new babies. Once it's clear that your dog has anxiety around the new family member, you need to take precautions. You can have a dog that's never been aggressive to other people, who will get nervous and anxious over the baby, and jump on them, or even bite them. There are things you can do and ways to train the dog to be chill around the baby, but they don't involve letting the anxious dog lay on the baby, in biting range.", "You would choose your dog over your own children.\n\nI honestly can't understand this mindset.\n\nIf this is truly how you feel then why have children", "That is not true for a fuck ton of dogs. SOME dogs are gentle and protective, some are protective and others don't fucky care or even dislike babys.", "She\u2019s 5 weeks postpartum she needs to focus on the baby, physically healing and mentally healing not a dog jumping when her supposed husband is caring for their child. It can quickly escalate from from whining to nipping to biting. Baby and mom takes priority", "Do you realize how delicate babies are? He is endangering his daughter because he can\u2019t train his dog properly.", "But the dog isn't to blame. OP for proving just how low his wife ranks on his priority list, and how low their child ranks, is to blame. \n\nIt might not even be PPD, just buyer's remorse in marrying and procreating with this guy.", "Plus, dog coming onto couch when not invited. This man is not in control!\n\nChihuahuas are the number one biter of children. They never get in trouble because their owners think they are so cute.

The weight of a corgie on a newborn's torso, could damage internal organs, particularly if the dog was standing so the weight was all focused on the dog's foot.\n\nJust because a corgie feels small to you, as a grown human, doesn't mean that it isn't huge and dangerous compared to a newborn.", "The dog weight is 3x the weight of the baby,", "The fact he's allowing the behavior to continue by putting his baby and dog in a position for the dog to do things like stand on his babies face implies he's not actually trying.\n\nStep one of correcting behavioral problems in dogs is not setting them up to fail.", "He says she was just diagnosed with postpartum depression in the post?\n\nI don't know really anything about dogs - that's why I said I wouldn't give advice regarding the dogs. I don't know how to get dogs to adjust to babies. Personally I just wouldn't have dogs around babies at all - but I'm also aware people have pets and obviously do.. hence why my focus was on him just doing what his wife asks as any additional stress on top of postnatal depression is dangerous and detrimental to everyone.", "Yeah I would have assumed that but I didn't want to insert my opinion and then have people get really mad lol cause I am actually really scared of dogs so I'm aware my opinions might be skewed. I'm one of those 'don't let a dog anywhere near a baby ever' person :P\n\nI definitely have no idea what kind of behaviour is normal or what to do to address the abnormal behaviour so thanks so much for explaining - that's interesting to learn about!\n\nI did have postpartum depression though, and I had really bad anxiety that something was going to happen to my baby and it was really debilitating so I feel absolutely awful for OPs partner for having to deal with that amplified because of genuine safety concerns.", "Yes I realize how resilient babies are\u2026I\u2019m a medic lol\u2026\n\nDelicate?\n\nBabies bounce\u2026.\n\nAdults break\u2026", "Aren't corgis kind of territorial and temperamental too?\n\nIdk, I actually don't like corgis at all and I've never had one, so I could be wrong.", "I'm sure any dog could inflict damage, and if he had then this post would be a lot different. My point is about all the unhelpful spin in OP's comment.", "My dog is 30-35 lbs and slightly less dwarfy than a corgi (keeshond/sheltie mix) and she's sweet as pie but I know for a fact she can fuck up an adult human easy enough, let alone a child or infant.", "Yep that kid's legs are probably broken. They'll never walk.", "Oh but he takes safety measures and whatnot... Just won't describe them for an unbiased account. Bad OP, bad!", "Yeah, I think that there's always a range of behaviors and factors you need to take into consideration (dog's temperament, if they've been around children before, age of the kids, etc.) and I've seen some dogs that are super sweet with babies and will just curl up by a bassinet and be the most gentle giants you've ever seen... And I've also seen dogs that get aggressive and need to be separated immediately to avoid Bad Situation.\n\nI don't pretend to be an expert, but a dog acting territorial around a baby definitely falls into the second category, and needs to be taken away, a trainer needs to intervene, and in some cases, the dog may even need to be rehomed if they can't be trained to be safe around the baby. I'm a huge dog person, I've rescued and trained aggressive dogs before, I love them\u2014 They've got to come second to a human child's safety, though. \n\nI haven't had kids yet, but I can't imagine how stressed out OP's wife must be, dealing with the physical strain of having had a baby, PPD, the genuine concerns over the dog (possibly even a dog she really loves!), and the realization that her partner won't take their child's safety seriously.", "I really hope you're lying about being a medic", "They're herding dogs with dwarfism. A domesticated predator selectively bred for centuries to bully livestock many times its size into compliance. But because they have \"cute\" short legs, people ignore that they're working dogs bred for tenacity, toughness, and a willingness to bite stuff to get their way.\n\nLike other herding breeds, an emotionally stable corgi with its needs met and some consistency and structure to its life can be an awesome family dog. That...does not seem to describe this guy's dog.", "You do realize that newborns can't even support their own head right? Why would you think a medium sized dog jumping on them would be perfectly safe?", "Yes, obviously if I don't think that the corgi is trampling the baby into jelly like a herd of charging buffalo, then the only other possible conclusion is that the baby is perfectly safe. That's exactly what I said.", "You're the one arguing with people who were noting the safety hazard"]}
