Not wanting him there is reasonable. I also understand that your sister had a different relationship with him and may want him present. If he comes, keep your distance and ensure you have security in place to keep him away from you specifically.", "Alternative title: AITA for not wanting my abuser to come to my university graduation?\n\nWhen you put it this way you're definitely NTA here. Don't invite him.", "NTA. He is an abuser, you are a victim. Stand your ground.", "NTA. \n\nI've seen an estranged parent make a horrible scene at a graduation. It ruined everyone's day. \n\nThey are incapable of respecting boundaries \u2014 they're tantalizing opportunities to assert themselves and belittle you, not rules to be followed.\n\nI would also ask your other parent not to share your personal news with him (or however he got the news, endeavor to make it stop). That's really important going forward.", "NTA, restraining order comes to mind. How is he even allowed to roam the streets?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he tries to talk to you, ignore him. If he touches you or threatens you, have the police on speed dial and call them.", "NTA\n\nBut why in the world would you mother and sister want him there or even entertain the thought, knowing he was abusive to you?\n\nFrankly, I wouldn't trust him not to show up. Skip the graduation. I'm sure you can fake food poisoning or a dental emergency that day.", "NTA at all. Given you're of age you should think about getting into a form of martial arts, you should also make yourself familiar with every self defense tool you can afford. The more trained you are the better equipped you'll be to handle any possibility.", "Nah (beside your bio father obviously).

No tickets were available to people who weren't graduating.", "Absolutely positively NTA. You don\u2019t owe him a damn thing!!", "NTA, People like him should not be called Father", "Wondering how he can attend without an invitation.  As many allow so many invitations per student to give. It assures seating for all as well. But he doesn\u2019t belong to be at your graduation. Hopefully your sister didn\u2019t send him an invitation. NTA.

Your comment really resonated with me and I will talk with my sister more about it.", "Yeah I shared the news with an Uncle on his side so it's my fault that he's aware. I haven't told his family or anyone besides my immediate family that I'm no contact with him yet as it goes against their family beliefs in a way of being there for each other no matter the type of person they are.

I'll have a more in depth convo with her today about it.", "I was talking to an Uncle on his side and invited him so he must have talked to bio father about it. Since his family all live out of state and I'm not close enough to any of them to tell them yet that we're no contact.
