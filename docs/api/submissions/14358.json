However, now that there's a considerable amount of money involved, they're acting like they're entitled to a share. It's starting to get on my nerves, to say the least.\n\nTo add to this, I know that my half-siblings are struggling financially, and I sympathize with their situation. But, at the end of the day, I don't believe it's my responsibility to bail them out or make up for their financial mistakes. On top of that, they never even shared their lunch with me back in kindergarten, so why should I be expected to share my hard-earned inheritance with them?\n\nOn the other hand, I understand that it might seem selfish to keep everything for myself, but my father trusted me to manage his assets and carry on his legacy. I intend to honor his wishes and keep everything for myself.\n\nSo, I guess my question is, am I the asshole for not sharing my inheritance with my half-siblings, even though they feel entitled to a share?

Despite their absence in my life and my father's clear intention to leave everything to me, they have been pressuring me to share the inheritance with them.\n\n(2) The reason why this action might make me the asshole is because it could be seen as selfish and lacking empathy towards my half-siblings. They may be struggling financially, and the inheritance could be a significant help to them. Furthermore, even though we didn't have a close relationship, they are still my siblings and it might be seen as cold-hearted to completely exclude them from the inheritance. Additionally, my mention of the lunch incident from kindergarten could be seen as petty and irrelevant to the current situation, and might further cement the perception that I'm being unnecessarily greedy and ungenerous.\n\nOverall, my actions could be seen as insensitive and self-centered, which could potentially make me the asshole in this scenario.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why would that matter and was their even an opportunity? Seems like OP is trying very hard to justify, and hasn\u2019t explained why they were left out of the will. Maybe because OP knows the reason was petty?", "Maybe he took care of his father when he was older.", "Seriously wtf is a \"hard earned inheritance\" lol", "Maybe the dad was abusive? I don\u2019t know it was weird wording. But NTA it\u2019s yours.", "[removed]", "Care giving possibly.  I've been around a couple situations where one child did all the doctors appointments, driving, end of life care, arrangements.\n\nPretty much solo.  Then other siblings have a surprise Pikachu face when that sibling got the house.\n\nOr simply hard earned because they freaking lost their father.  You don't get another one.", "An inheritance can be hard earned, either where the child has (for example) worked on their parents\u2019 farm or business and contributed to its success and then inherits; or where they have looked after a sick or elderly parent as main caregiver for an extended period.", "Or, as appears to be the case here, the deceased had other wishes.", "Exactly, this comes up every day on this sub. The only person who knows exactly why the others were left out of the Will is dead, stop feeling guilty, if he wanted you to split that inheritance he would have put that in the Will.", "Well said!!  I agree, OP is NTA", "Calling his father an asshole, without knowing why he excluded others from his will, makes you an asshole. Maybe there was perfectly good reason to exclude them, don't jump to conclusions.", "We don't know the reason for that. Since it was the father who left his family and, judging on the fact that all the kids were in the kindergarten at the same time, soon started a new one, the father could be TA here, not the \"old children\".", "Right? And while OP doesn\u2019t explicitly state it, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re older since they\u2019re from the previous marriage. Unless OP is an affair child and the father left his pregnant wife? Because I find it hard to believe that they would all be in kindergarten together to share lunches. But completely understand why they wouldn\u2019t share", "That\u2019s my guess. It would explain their resentment of OP (and ostensibly the father if he removed them from the will).", "To be fair, they didn't say how their father passed away", "This nonsense. People definitions of \"hard earned\" are getting out of control.", "It's yours now, and what you do with it is your choice.", "Can \u201clegacy\u201d also refer to their job? Maybe OP\u2019s father had a business and asked OP to invest in that", "I read your comment with my best friend\u2019s voice LOL", "I read it as a \u201cnever ever they did something nice to me since I know them\u201d", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Hopefully he responds soon", "That\u2019s how I took it, maybe dad is an asshole and she\u2019s the only one who put up with it", "I took care of my mother for three years before she passed away. I never considered it as working for my inheritance, nor did I expect more than my siblings. I just thought of it as taking care of my mother. I loved her, though, and maybe OP's parent was a total nightmare.", "Touche", "It can, yes. Which is why I'm curious instead of accusatory.", "Thats a poor example of not being nice, and actually makes OP come off as greedy. Two kids from a broken home have to share their lunches with OP, who has a mom and their dad, in order to be be considered nice? On top of that, OP never said that they were nice to their half siblings. \u201cThey were absent from my life\u2019s milestones\u201d with no mention of OP being at theirs", "My mother got a \"hard earned inheritance\" from her mother. It came after years of being her PoA and doing all of her paperwork/financials/taxes and facilitating everything with her multiple nursing home/memory care unit moves, facilitating appointment scheduling and doctor's orders. All those kinds of things. It could have been something like that too.", " Unless OPs father was sick and being cared for solely by OP inheritance is a gift but not exactly hard earned."]}
