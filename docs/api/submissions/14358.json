However, my two half-siblings from his previous marriage have been pressuring me to share the inheritance with them, even though my father specifically excluded them from the will.\n\nNow, I'll admit, my half-siblings and I never had a close relationship. We barely spoke, and they were absent for most of my important events and milestones. However, now that there's a considerable amount of money involved, they're acting like they're entitled to a share. It's starting to get on my nerves, to say the least.\n\nTo add to this, I know that my half-siblings are struggling financially, and I sympathize with their situation. But, at the end of the day, I don't believe it's my responsibility to bail them out or make up for their financial mistakes. On top of that, they never even shared their lunch with me back in kindergarten, so why should I be expected to share my hard-earned inheritance with them?\n\nOn the other hand, I understand that it might seem selfish to keep everything for myself, but my father trusted me to manage his assets and carry on his legacy. I intend to honor his wishes and keep everything for myself.\n\nSo, I guess my question is, am I the asshole for not sharing my inheritance with my half-siblings, even though they feel entitled to a share?

Despite their absence in my life and my father's clear intention to leave everything to me, they have been pressuring me to share the inheritance with them.\n\n(2) The reason why this action might make me the asshole is because it could be seen as selfish and lacking empathy towards my half-siblings. They may be struggling financially, and the inheritance could be a significant help to them. Furthermore, even though we didn't have a close relationship, they are still my siblings and it might be seen as cold-hearted to completely exclude them from the inheritance. Additionally, my mention of the lunch incident from kindergarten could be seen as petty and irrelevant to the current situation, and might further cement the perception that I'm being unnecessarily greedy and ungenerous.\n\nOverall, my actions could be seen as insensitive and self-centered, which could potentially make me the asshole in this scenario.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
