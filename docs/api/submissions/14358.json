We barely spoke, and they were absent for most of my important events and milestones. However, now that there's a considerable amount of money involved, they're acting like they're entitled to a share. It's starting to get on my nerves, to say the least.\n\nTo add to this, I know that my half-siblings are struggling financially, and I sympathize with their situation. But, at the end of the day, I don't believe it's my responsibility to bail them out or make up for their financial mistakes. On top of that, they never even shared their lunch with me back in kindergarten, so why should I be expected to share my hard-earned inheritance with them?\n\nOn the other hand, I understand that it might seem selfish to keep everything for myself, but my father trusted me to manage his assets and carry on his legacy. I intend to honor his wishes and keep everything for myself.\n\nSo, I guess my question is, am I the asshole for not sharing my inheritance with my half-siblings, even though they feel entitled to a share?

Despite their absence in my life and my father's clear intention to leave everything to me, they have been pressuring me to share the inheritance with them.\n\n(2) The reason why this action might make me the asshole is because it could be seen as selfish and lacking empathy towards my half-siblings. They may be struggling financially, and the inheritance could be a significant help to them. Furthermore, even though we didn't have a close relationship, they are still my siblings and it might be seen as cold-hearted to completely exclude them from the inheritance. Additionally, my mention of the lunch incident from kindergarten could be seen as petty and irrelevant to the current situation, and might further cement the perception that I'm being unnecessarily greedy and ungenerous.\n\nOverall, my actions could be seen as insensitive and self-centered, which could potentially make me the asshole in this scenario.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My advice to Chase was to not just give him half the assets otherwise they would likely be squandered immediately. Instead, he set aside half the money and used it to help Greg until he was in a place to be responsible with the money in the first place. This included paying for rehab/therapy which Greg successfully completed, a downpayment on a house and then gradually Chase felt comfortable on his own giving the rest to his brother without fearing that he would destroy his life with it.

Place it where they cannot touch it until their old enough to retire!", "YTA\n\nLet's be honest, you were part of the second family and they were abandoned by your father. You've answered no questions on this sub and you think inhertiance is hard earned?  \n\n\nEdit:  \nLiterally after I posted I was thinking, you're complaining they never attended any of your events and milestones, but were you ever there for theirs?", "NTA. I wouldn't share it with them. You don't have to. Even if you decide to give them some, then they would want more. I'd also hire a lawyer and draw up some paperwork to prevent from suing you for extra money. The money is all they want. Nothing else. They don't care about you or your feelings.", "NTA on the surface of things but a lot of relationship details are missing from the story.  OP is making this situation about him/herself and the half-siblings' relationship or lack thereof, but it isn't.  OP specifically said father intentionally left out half-siblings.  From what OP has mentioned it seems she/he and the father were estranged or LC with OP's half-siblings.  \n\nI think OP's uneasiness in this matter may be due to the father's reasons for excluding his other children from his estate.  Why were they excluded, OP?", "OP NTA. Don't listen to everyone jumping on you. An inheritance isn't a right. Your dad made the decision, not you, and whatever issues y'all had, or they had, are not of your concerns they ignored you until he died then stuck their hands out. Not your problem. I mean if you have a lot, and they have kids, a nice gesture would be to possibly create a trust for said kids, but you aren't obligated to. But I think it would be nice...then go NC, change phone number, move, etc. I hate people who expect shit when someone dies.", "Ok. NTA\n\nBut some of your comments sound judgmental. Now\u2026 I am missing context. But sharing snacks in kindergarten? Assuming they suck at money management? Yes\u2026 they might be bad at it. They also likely had a different financial experience than you and you had no idea. \n\nLet me share my spouse\u2019s experience. Dad was wildly abusive to him his brother and mom. She left him after he threw her down the stairs and she lost a baby. And he HATED her for leaving. Didn\u2019t treat the boys great with him. Bragged to them about how he hid income so he wouldn\u2019t have to pay child support. Because \u201cthat bitch just wants my money.\u201d She never asked for alimony ever. Just child support and money towards schooling. He never paid. \n\nHated her so much, he hated the boys. Treated them like crap. Even stole money that was supposed to go to them from his dad. \n\nHe later remarried. Apparently good to new wife and new kids. Totally different situation. They all live a good life and only know an amazing dad who treats them well. \n\nMeanwhile, the boys grew up with a single mom who didn\u2019t always have a lot to provide them. She struggled. As a result\u2026 no money to do college. Their money with first jobs went to Mom and helping the household. They weren\u2019t exactly set up in life. In fact my spouse had a blow up mattress for a long time due to cost when he first moved on his own. \n\nWe know he and his brother won\u2019t be in the will. We\u2019re at peace with it. As far as my spouse is concerned, his step dad that he got in his mid 20s has been more of a dad to him. Won\u2019t be money there either. It is what it is. I also come from a pretty low income family. So we know there\u2019ll never be help and we expect that. We\u2019re also both used to going without when there\u2019s no cash and living simply. \n\nNow if anyone was to say this to my spouse\u2019s half siblings. They\u2019d have zero idea what\u2019s gone on. The things said or done. His brother is in touch with them. And like I say, they all sound very happy. So if a similar thing happened they\u2019d probably feel the same. That they shouldn\u2019t owe. \n\nAll this to say\u2026 no\u2026 you don\u2019t owe them. That\u2019s your Dad who should\u2019ve either left them an explanation, or something (even a collection of photos as a kid). But don\u2019t judge them for it. You have no idea what went on. And often kids get caught in the legacy of what the adults did and their feelings from decades ago (this includes you).", "Keep the money. You don\u2019t owe them ANYTHING. Your father left it to you. They don\u2019t care about you, or having a relationship with you, they only care about your money and assets. Once they have it, they\u2019ll disappear again. Keep the money, block them if you have to", "Shame on your father for abandoning his first family and being everything to you and nothing to your brothers. Nice icing on the cake for him to ignore them in death as well. You and your mother took their father, how about giving them the money he left?

That is the moral dilemma of this AITA post.", "Whoa, OP isn't expecting anything from them anymore. Clearly you missed the point of the comment, that AS A CHILD op wanted to share and be close with siblings. Who doesn't? And since you decided to speculate, maybe just maybe the mom left for a new family, won custody cause you know, she's a woman, or maybe didn't win custody and the siblings blamed dad or mom turned them against the dad or hell maybe the mom died and they hated that dad moved on....there are sooooo many scenarios and many of them don't involve the dad being a dick.", "You are trying to retcon your words,  not me", "Yta.\nSolely for calling handed down money \u201chard earned\u201d These are his kids too though right?

It was given to you. Honestly, talking about your \"hard earned\" inheritance makes you sound like one of those rich people who were born into wealth and luxury growing up and telling everyone that they're \"self-made.\" It's weird.

Your lack of communication leads to some big holes, and that makes me assume the worst: its a huge sum, and sharing probably won\u2019t affect your base inheritance; you \u201cworked\u201d for it by being the new golden child with a new mom, but didn\u2019t necessarily do anything to take care of your dad while he was aging or sick; your siblings are from his first marriage, and you were an accident from his mistress who he then left his first wife for; the kindergarten lunch thing was because you were similar ages (possibly even in the same grade, meaning dad cheated while wife was pregnant) and they were mad at you because you got dad full time and they didn\u2019t; they cut dad out after years of feeling less than as a result of him leaving their mom \u201cfor you\u201d (and your mom); you didn\u2019t bother to attend their big events either. \n\nSo, YTA.", "YTA for not answering the obvious question dominating the thread.", "Hard earned inheritance basically made op sound like a a-hole.
