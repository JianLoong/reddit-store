It seems she wants you to enforce a double standard. \n\nAs long as you and your customers are ok with what Laura is wearing, Mary's opinion doesn't matter.", "I don't think you were being unreasonable. And if Mary and Laura have their own sections to serve, they're not actually competing head to head for tips. No customer who fails to tip Mary is then going to go over to Laura's section and tip *her*.\n\nYeah, Laura might be pulling in more in tips a night, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.  NTA.", "NTA. Also Laura is abiding by the dress code. She's literally wearing a required black or gray bottom. You include shorts and skirts as qualifying as a bottom. End of discussion. \n\n\nUnless a customer complained that what Laura is wearing to work is inappropriate, there's no problem unless you decide it is as the owner.", "NTA - It sucks Mary feels that way but unfortunately this is life. There is nothing more to it. You did nothing wrong and neither did Laura based on your post.", "NTA\n\nIf Laura is wearing the provided polo shirt, and you feel that the shorts or skirt she is wearing is appropriate then there shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA. Since you explained that they both have their own sections, people from Mary's section aren't gonna tip Laura if she's not their server. So regardless of the way she dresses, which seems to be within dress code anyway, then there shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\\---\n\nOn a side note, I'm not sure how much a throwaway is gonna help since there's some specific details that can be quite telling.", "NTA, it's your decision whether to push for any kind of dress code or not.", "NTA, seems like she may be jealous of her for some reason.", "NTA You friend is sadly insecure due to her scars. Your dresscode is lax and she was able to work around it to be comfortable (which is awesome by the way, strict dress codes make most people uncomfortable). Laura was following the dress code to her comfort level as well. Her problem with it is not yours.", "INFO: I'd like to highlight that it's a bit weird that Mary feels they're competing for tips. How does tipping work there? Do the servers have set tables/sections, or are they somehow choosing Laura over Mary to be served by/tip? Does Laura know she's in this competition or is it an invention of Mary's?  \n\nBasically: is the way the restaurant is run re: tipping actually *taking money out of Mary's pocket* when Laura is tipped? \n\nBecause if so, *that* needs to change, no one will ever be happy in an environment like that. Servers shouldn't feel like they have to jockey against other servers for tips. \n\nBut if the tips are separate to start with and they have equal opportunities to be tipped that cannot be \"poached\" by another server, then it doesn't really matter who wears what, and you're doing everything fine -- Mary's just feeling a bit insecure in a way that's on her to manage.", "Definitely NTA. I get why Mary has insecurities but she shouldn't project them onto others.", "NTA\n\nSounds like the server is wearing appropriate clothing. You can't control the tipping and maybe she's tipped more because she's more competent or friendly.", "I\u2019ve been a cook in this business for 20+ years and rigid dress codes are an unnecessary hassle that breeds resentment. You are doing this exactly right and as Mary\u2019s boss she was straight out of line for complaining about a decision that is just yours,never even minding the fact that she\u2019s likely to encounter pretty females who dress in ways she won\u2019t in *every* part of her life. \n\n If you ever talk to her again,I\u2019d suggest doing it as a friend and not even mention the restaurant. It\u2019s seems to me that she has more than *physical* scarring from that accident.", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand the tipping culture, it doesn\u2019t exist where I live, but it seems from yours and other comments that you\u2019ve got things set up fairly, and if she\u2019s not being tipped as much then perhaps she needs to perk up her hospitality game and get that friendly smile on! Personality and great service is everything!", "NTA\n\nBut you need to sit down with your old family friend and have a talk.  Both of you know what this is about but nothing can be done.  Even if you were to offer to augment her income, that would not solve the underlying insecurity she has.", "NTA. Mary seems to be projecting her insecurities onto the new employee. Wearing a skirt might get you more in tips sometimes, but I doubt it makes that much of a difference. And even if it did, that\u2019s not on you. You don\u2019t have a strict dress code staying long pants are required, so new employee is well within her right to wear what she\u2019s wearing.", "Nta, I work a restaurant and our dress code is exactly the same.  \n\nThe uniform shirt and whatever jeans or black skirt, shorts, or pants we want to wear.  We can wear black long sleeves under our uniform shirt or a unbuttoned flannel on top.  \n\nI personally I think your dress code is pretty standard, and Mary will find that out pretty soon if she goes out to find another serving job.  Her tips are less because Laura either had regular customers who request her as their server, or she's just a better server than Mary.  \n\nEither way it had nothing to do with the dress code", "It is a close call, but I gotta go with NTA.\n\nFor one thing,  wearing shorts or a skirt might get a server better tips, but that really does nothing to another server.  Second, it sounds like you are somewhat consistent on being lax with the dress code.  It's hard to call it playing favorites when you were lax on the dress code the other way for the person angered. \n\nThe point for you to reflect on is why you have a dress code if you are not going to enforce it?  If you just want them all to wear the polo and pants presumably for kitchen staff, then just set that as the policy, and you would never have run into this.  You are the boss, and a clearer policy would have prevented the whole thing.", "At the risk of being an armchair psychologist I dont think this is really about tips. \n\nI think Mary is understandably upset about her scarring and seeing Laura able to wear shorts and short sleeves and get attention for it is rubbing salt in the emotional wound. Of course its not fair to require everyone to cover up as much as Mary feels comfortable, but I think Mary deserves a bit of sympathy for the feelings shes having.", "Not the asshole, you sound like a reasonable guy. Maybe she feels a little self conscious about herself or just jealous because the other lady is a better waitress", "Technically yes, you are an AH.  \n\nYTA.  Not creating a uniform that everyone adheres to allows an employee to show a little more skin to get a higher tip.", "NTA the bottom half isn't specified.\n\nIf she wants better tips be a better server?\n\nOr pay them both a living wage?", "OP due to the tight labor market, \"family friend\" versus your business surviving there's nothing that you can really do here.  There's just too many businesses that have been around for decades closing due to the economic climate and you can't please everyone.  Small business owners fail to realize they not only have themselves to support, but ALL of their employees, as well as their vendors who depend on the purchase of their products and services.  You can't alter Mary's personal opinion of the situation, but as long as you're not forcing an illegal situation then focus on running a successful restaurant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While Mary\u2019s accident is unfortunate, it does not give her the right to police another\u2019s clothing choice. She\u2019s benefitted from your lax uniform policy, but doesn\u2019t like the turn tables. I also fail to see how Laura is putting her at a disadvantage if they have their own sections. Has it occurred to her that maybe Laura is a better waitress and Mary\u2019s attitude could be the reason of her smaller tips? Give Mary space, if she\u2019s a good family friend, I\u2019m sure you guys can work it out. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend hiring her again, she tried to use her long standing relationship with you to get what she wanted and threw a fit when it didn\u2019t work. Keep that in mind", "NTA.  Sad she feels so self conscious but you shouldn't force other people to dress based on Mary's feeling.  Good for you for being a reasonable boss/owner for all your workers despite your long relationship with Mary.  Hope she will realize she was wrong quickly.", "uhh Mary is slut shaming Laura? f that nonsense.\n\nbeing the boss means you will have perfectly reasonable policies and people will still get mad at you. you've got to have a backbone and not listen to every asshole who criticizes you.\n\nIf Mary walked out in the middle of her shift tho, she needs to be fired.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Servers are notoriously territorial.", "NTA. \n\n\nI used to work for a retail store, earning commission and tips, that didn\u2019t have a dress code at all. There was one employee who would always wear strappy tank tops, short-shorts with fishnets and combat boots. She was super cute, and she enjoyed dressing cute. One day during a staff meeting, a different coworker started a conversation about working in a \u201csexually competitive work environment,\u201d a concept that I myself had never considered\u2026 \n\nWe ended up not changing the policy and kept going with the no-dress code, but the discussion made us all aware of each other in an empathetic way. The fishnets-and-boots employee was more mindful of (mostly male) customers gravitating to her more than the rest of us, and would sometimes pass them off to someone else for a chance at the commission / tips. \n\nEven though no policy changed, having that meeting and conversation created a stronger sense of security. And it was a huge morale boost, because we all had a better understanding of each other\u2019s experience as a salesperson.", "I second this - it is your choice not to have a dress code, both of them are in an equal position to dress as they choose to work and neither are prevented from dressing to \"get more tips\" if they want to.  \n\n\nNTA", ">On a side note, I'm not sure how much a throwaway is gonna help since there's some specific details that can be quite telling.\n\nIt's more so people you know and who recognize you don't go poking around, looking at everything else you've posted on your main account.", "They both have their separate sections, and they pitch in a small amount for the dishwasher.", "NTA.  I'm trying to decide whether it's a close call or not.  But the description is confusing.\n\nIt sounds like there is a dress code, and both employees are meeting it.\n\nIt sounds like your family friend was looking for extra consideration because she's your family friend.  And she was angry when you didn't back her up.  I can see that.\n\nI think there's a thing people say, don't mix business and family.  This is why.  You can't win.  Favoritism to help Mary would definitely have been asshole behavior IMO.", "You're right. I honestly thought I was being clear enough with the whole polo shirt thing, but maybe I need to check that out.", "Did you bother to read the post? They are asked to wear\nBlack or gray bottoms (be that pants, shorts, or a skirt)\nThis is standard for small restaurants that aren't fancy, and more laid back. OP says they are normal clothes, nothing crazy. This is about his friends hangup. The new girl isn't walking around wearing ass shorts and have her breasts hanging out. She is ADHEARING TO THE DRESS CODE", "Or if they know your main account they won't find this post that way", "Yeah then this is just on Mary, NTA. If she doesn't want to work there because your dress code isn't strict enough for her, she has that freedom, but it's her call, you're not required to change the attire *someone else* to suit her.", "Did you read where the OP says he created a loose dress code? I did.", "Exactly! If Mary has the same opportunities as Laura, then it's up to Mary to figure out how to increase her average amount. While I fully understand how one's dress impacts tips - behaviors do as well. Putting a smiley face on checks apparently works to increase tips. \n\nReminds me of something I saw a while ago online where a woman changed into different hairstyles to see if tips changed and it did. More sexy styles got more. Two side ponies, or pigtails, won out. Kinda creepy to think of, actually.", "Yeah, and that's pretty standard for small restaurants ( worked in plenty)\n\n\n\nETA - This is also the type of place people would actually want to work at, a loose dress code is amazing."]}
