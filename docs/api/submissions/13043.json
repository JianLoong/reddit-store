I wouldn't go out of my way to be petty if someone asked me maybe try to avoid getting smoke in their house, then again because I'm a considerate neighbour I make an effort to avoid that from the start. Cigarette smoke inside is absolutely disgusting.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, I was almost on your side until you complained about the fan. You wanted to keep smoking, they don\u2019t want cancer or smoke stench that you\u2019re probably nose blind to in their home so that was probably the most agreeable solution. At first when I started reading I thought the neighbor was gonna be attacking you for little reason based on a habit you\u2019re absolutely allowed to have but it seems like you\u2019re instigating the conflicts.", "And she's not responsible for your shitty addiction powered evening.", "Why do they have to bear the responsibility for the smoke wafting to them, smoke that is coming from you.\n\nEdited for format.", "Kids are people so yes when you hurt them you are responsible for that.", "You\u2019re responsible for your own actions.

Imaging just tying to live in your own home and seeing your children exposed to poison in the air.", "Why do you think your neighbor is responsible for your feelings then? You're just asking for a war of the assholes until you hate where you live because of perfectly legal harassment your neighbor will no doubt wage after seeing how thin skinned you are. And you deserve it, because hey, it's totally cool they make your life miserable as long as they don't break any laws! YTA", "You are if YOU are putting them in danger. Which you are by smoking."]}
