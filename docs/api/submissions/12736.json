{"id": 12736, "submission_id": "11waedu", "title": "AITA for saying dishwashing is unskilled labor?", "selftext": "I've been seeing this girl for 3 months who I'm pretty into. She's a professional chef, hot, and a basically a badass. She smokes pot and drinks a lot more than me but other than that I have no complaints. She's very assertive because she has to be in her line of work and luckily I'm into that (if you know what I mean).\n\nShe works at an upscale bar (hence the drinking) where the food is really important and she's super talented so her dishes get written up in our local media which is so cool. It feels a bit like dating a celebrity when we go out because she seems to know all the \"industry\" people and we get free drinks and stuff.\n\nThe problem came up when she was complaining about her job, which she does a lot. She says her boss is unsupportive and won't hire more help for the kitchen. Right now she does almost everything herself so her hours are crazy long and she's stressed all the time. I agree it doesn't make sense to be so short staffed because it seems like the bar is always busy and they make good money. The owner is an old-school boomer guy who thinks she's overreacting (or so she says).\n\nI don't like feeling helpless when she complains about work so I offered to help wash dishes one night so she wouldn't have to work until 3am and we could go out. I made a lot of money in tech and retired early so I have some time on my hands. She looked surprised and laughed and said \"thank you for the offer\". I was kind of hoping she would turn me down but the way she said it was kinda patronizing so I pressed a bit.\n\nShe went into professional mode and asked if I'd ever washed dishes before. I said, yes, obviously, but not in a restaurant or anything. Now she looked really annoyed and asked why I thought I could just jump in and wash dishes without any experience. I laughed at this and said anyone could wash dishes. Teenagers do it as their first job. She got offended and said I didn't understand the realities of kitchen work because it's not easy and dishwashers are the most important person in the restaurant.\n\nI thought that was a huge exaggeration. I worked at a Wendy's in high school and it's the same damn skill set. What **she** does is skilled but washing dishes is not skilled labor. She said \"there's no such thing as unskilled labor\" and \"I'd take you up on your offer if I thought you wouldn't mess up service\". I thought that was really rude and misguided (no such thing as unskilled labor? Are you kidding me?) and told her so. She told me I was condescending and presumptuous and she gets enough of that from her boss. The date was awkward for a while until she smiled and changed the subject but now I can't stop wondering if her boss doesn't have a point about her overreacting.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: She specifically said she needed a dishwasher, I didn't just pick it because I thought it was easy. Sorry that was unclear.\n\nEDIT 2: All she said by way of explanation was I'd get \"run over\". I asked what made it \"skilled\" and she said I was starting a bigger conversation that she didn't want to have right then while she was upset and not entirely sober.

You, who haven't worked in a food establishment since high school are discounting her experience.  You worked at a Wendy's which has a fixed menu,  doesn't serve food on plates with flatware and uses paper cups. Dishwashing at a fast food restaurant is not the same as at full service restaurant.  Your attempt to wash dishes \\*would\\* disrupt service at your date's restaurant.  Fitting in with a team of workers and know what to do is a key part to running a successful restaurant kitchen.  Washing dishes may be a humble position, but it's absolutely crucial to the running of the kitchen.  It's similar to engine oil in a car:  you don't realize how crucial it is until the engine seizes.\n\nYou are dating someone who works full time in a professional cooking environment and you responded as condescending AH.  OP, YTA", "I\u2019m not gonna give judgement one way or the other even though that\u2019s what this entire community is about- I\u2019m just gonna insert my own personal my experience which is that dishwashing for a high traffic restaurant is tiring as hell because you never stop moving and it\u2019s extremely uncomfortable the entire time because it\u2019s hot and humid and there\u2019s practically no down time", "YTA\n\nThere are practically no jobs that a person can jump in and do without training. That is what she meant by no job is unskilled labor. You're a snob.\n\nYou made it worse by continuing along with your insistence of demeaning a job that she finds extremely important. Without proper dishwashing, she can't do her job. She can't plate on dirty or improperly cleaned dishes. She values her dishwashers. \n\nYou could learn a little respect and not look down on jobs that you feel are beneath your high level.", "YTA. There is indeed no such thing as unskilled labor, and doing the dishes in any active restaurant is NOTHING like washing the dishes at home. This is coming from someone who has worked as a chef's assistent.\n\nYou need to work fast, you need to be organized,  you need to have a very high stress tolerance and you need to keep moving constantly. You need to keep up the pace just as much as any chef, because if you end up slacking, the dishes will build up, the chefs might not be able to put out the orders because there aren't enough plates or tools to keep cooking, and that shit happens in the blink of an eye.\n\nIt is damn near endless, especially if you're the only one doing the dishes. In most cases, you are also the one who needs to go and gather up the dishes that people leave behind in the dining area, depending on the type of restaurant. You also have to put the dishes back in their designated spots once they're clean.\n\nIt's not just about doing the dishes, it's about keeping the place running. Believe it or not, but dishwashing is one of the most important parts if you want a fully functioning kitchen.", "YTA for insincerely offering to help which she probably picked up on and decided to humble you. It's nice that she views all people working in the kitchen as equal despite what others might perceive as /better work/, that's how you know she's mindful and a team player. You claim to respect her work and status but undermine her complaining (which seems legitimate so shame on you) and her opinions, hope she sees this as the first of many red flags.", "YTA. As someone who grew up in the service industry and now works in tech\u2026 your dismissal of her concerns is typical tech attitude for service workers. \n\nDishwashing is important and skilled labor. It\u2019s not just the stuff customers use, but the chefs / line as well. Plus the dishwasher usually runs unseen duties if things are busy. Never mind if a dirty plate makes it to the front and messes up a plating before it\u2019s caught. \n\nMaybe. MAYBE. instead of taking it personally you could have asked questions to understand why it wasn\u2019t a good fit, and found another way to help.", "YTA. You insulted her and she put you in your place. She\u2019s probably right, and it\u2019s presumptuous of you to assume you understand her work environment completely.", "YTA\n\nDepending on how busy a restaurant is, turn over can be high which means you need a dishwasher who can clean those dishes quickly. Not just the dishes & utensils customers use but the ones the chefs use.", "Absolutely YTA. She\u2019s the chef and you\u2019re the unemployed tech bro. She knows the job and you don\u2019t. Check your overinflated sense of self worth, brochacho.", "YTA. Being a dishwasher in a busy restaurant is not just washing dishes. It starts with going and finding the dishes (including the cooks' dishes) and clearing them off and then putting them back correctly, and no, that doesn't mean just in one location. All that while not trying to be underfoot. Comparing a franchise \"type X\" chain fast food joint with any real restaurant is also ignorant. And if you wouldn't be the AH already, you probably should feel like one for honestly taking her boss's word over hers when considering if she's overreacting.\n\nWas that statement of hers a tiny bit exaggerated? Yes, but not much. A busy kitchen is an assembly line where everything has its precise order, place and timing. This ain't cooking at home doing the dishes when they pile up. This is more like \"spot work yourself and grab it while getting out of everybody's work\" kinda thing, so yeah, in a kitchen, the statement \"there ain't no such thing as unskilled labour\" is more often true than not. Pretending you know better while providing \"I worked at Wendy's in high school\" as context is laughable.", "YTA for not simply asking why dishes isn't a simple task. Clearly it's her field. All you had to do was say  \"How is this different doing dishes at home? At first thought, I'd think dishes were simple too.

At a high end, or even middle grade, restaurant the dishwasher speed can make or break the night", "YTA for pushing the issue. As an ex-dishwasher, I can attest that it gets busy and can be overwhelming and a bit stressful at times but it's generally not exactly difficult - a 10-15 minute tutorial on how the dishwasher works, where the clean dishes get stacked etc is usually sufficient. Yes, it requires you to be fairly fast and use basic time-management skills but nothing your average adult can't do. Therefore, I suspect that your gf has other reasons why she doesn't want to work with you. Whether you want to open that can of worms is your call but I advise you to suck it up and move on.", "Unskilled labor is a myth used to justify poverty wages. YTA.", "Nta, dishwasher is unskilled labor, I should know I've done the job before. He have to be fast but besides that most if the work is done buy machines, you just need to spray it a bit. \n\nHonestly it sounds like she doesnt want to work with you. Think about it, it's a high stress job and I'm sure she doesnt want to yell at you or get annoyed by you. I think it's best to leave her job be and just be supportive. You cant fix all her problems.", "YTA. There is no unskilled labor. And dishes in a restaurant kitchen are different from dishes at home.", "YTA. It may be labour that requires minimal training, but there is barely any job, no matter how menial, that can be truly called \"unskilled\". I've never washed dishes or flipped burgers for a living, I did everything I could to avoid food service, because I've seen how fast and hard they work, and just how dangerous a commercial kitchen can be, and I didn't want a bar of it.\n\nThink this any time you think of anything as \"unskilled labour\": could you do it? Maybe. Could you do it as effectively, quickly, and consistently as someone who has literally been doing it for a living for years? Probably not, but hey, maybe you're a natural it's your true calling. Could you do it quickly, effectively, consistently, with an asshole boss and asshole clients screaming at you daily, and still front up to do it the next day? Do you have the mental fortitude for that? Probably not.", "YTA for assuming you knew better. \n\nIf her saying what she said about dishwashing in a restaurant kitchen surprised you, you should have asked WHY and learnt something new instead of dismissing her outright based on \u2026 what exactly?

I do miss those.", "YTA\n\nRestaurants don't just have a sink and a sponge like in your kitchen.  There are often commercial dishwashers that you'd have to be shown how to operate.

They'll have a system.  \n\nIt was nice of you to offer, but your delivery of it was off. And she's right...there is no such thing g as unskilled labor..", "I worked in a restaurant for three years. It was extremely difficult, because I worked in the kitchen. But you know what caused the most issues and made my job harder? Not having a dishwasher. I had a to fill in a few times when dishwashers didn\u2019t show up or their dishes got backed up. It was the toughest job in the restaurant and they deserve to be treated better. So yeah, YTA. It is very much a job that requires skill.", "Former chef and current woman in tech here.

Why is your headline about the question of skilled vs unskilled labor? **That's not even the part that pissed her off.**\n\nIt sounds to me like this woman probably works 50-60 hours a week for an old man who treats her like a hysterical female and dismisses her valid staffing concerns so she's burning out. He's probably got her on salary and she still gets the job done so there's no problem on his end. She's probably worked every station in multiple kitchens and her share of dishes to boot. The people who do these jobs work insanely hard. \n\nI'm saying that not only has this chick been to hell, she's the chef there.\n\nAnd now this wealthy unemployed tech dude, who gets to bask in her hard-earned industry cred, tosses out a bullshit offer to do a job he has so little respect for that he thinks he can just walk on for a night or two.\n\nYeah, I'd say that's pretty insulting.

Trust me, there is a difference between an unskilled dishwasher and a skilled one. It\u2019s an essential part of the kitchen and a bad one absolutely effects service.

She's a professional chef, hot, and a basically a badass. She smokes pot and drinks a lot more than me but other than that I have no complaints. She's very assertive because she has to be in her line of work and luckily I'm into that (if you know what I mean).\n\nShe works at an upscale bar (hence the drinking) where the food is really important and she's super talented so her dishes get written up in our local media which is so cool. It feels a bit like dating a celebrity when we go out because she seems to know all the \"industry\" people and we get free drinks and stuff.\n\nThe problem came up when she was complaining about her job, which she does a lot. She says her boss is unsupportive and won't hire more help for the kitchen. Right now she does almost everything herself so her hours are crazy long and she's stressed all the time. I agree it doesn't make sense to be so short staffed because it seems like the bar is always busy and they make good money. The owner is an old-school boomer guy who thinks she's overreacting (or so she says).\n\nI don't like feeling helpless when she complains about work so I offered to help wash dishes one night so she wouldn't have to work until 3am and we could go out. I made a lot of money in tech and retired early so I have some time on my hands. She looked surprised and laughed and said \"thank you for the offer\". I was kind of hoping she would turn me down but the way she said it was kinda patronizing so I pressed a bit.\n\nShe went into professional mode and asked if I'd ever washed dishes before. I said, yes, obviously, but not in a restaurant or anything. Now she looked really annoyed and asked why I thought I could just jump in and wash dishes without any experience. I laughed at this and said anyone could wash dishes. Teenagers do it as their first job. She got offended and said I didn't understand the realities of kitchen work because it's not easy and dishwashers are the most important person in the restaurant.\n\nI thought that was a huge exaggeration. I worked at a Wendy's in high school and it's the same damn skill set. What **she** does is skilled but washing dishes is not skilled labor. She said \"there's no such thing as unskilled labor\" and \"I'd take you up on your offer if I thought you wouldn't mess up service\". I thought that was really rude and misguided (no such thing as unskilled labor? Are you kidding me?) and told her so. She told me I was condescending and presumptuous and she gets enough of that from her boss. The date was awkward for a while until she smiled and changed the subject but now I can't stop wondering if her boss doesn't have a point about her overreacting.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You could pull anyone who isn't developmentally disabled off the street and having them adequately running dish after a 30 second explanation.", "thereby making you SKILLED in the kitchen.", "If OPs SO is running around and doing everything, I highly doubt they have a process going that's highly dependent on the dishwasher being perfect.", "So it's better to let the dishes pile up? OP says his SO said they were behind on dishes and needed a dishwasher, so obviously, they don't have a well-oiled process going right now, and any help would be better than an unmanned wash station. Think of a Nascar crew, just without the last crew member.", "I'm gonna assume validation, praise, and sex.", "At high end people will literally work for free", "Actually this almost verbatim what she said when she called me presumptuous. I get it.", "it's not valid. Unskilled labor is defined, it's not a subjective thing. Jesus people are shilling here", "alright educate me, what specific skills do I need to become a dish washer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, OP mentioned they don't even have a dishwasher, so I don't really see how having an extra pair of hands will slow down an already slow process", "Ok but having no dishwasher doesn't?! Isn't it better to have someone slower maybe but still than no one to help?", "I wash the dishes at home and I'm starting to get a complex over whether I'm qualified enough. I had always assumed it was a cycle of dish in water scrub scrub dish clean.", "I\u2019ve done it as well. Not everything goes through the machine. Different pots and utensils need different cleaning methods. Stocking and sanitizing walk ins. Bringing supplies to the line Changing soda lines. Cleaning a high chair a toddler had diarrhea in. Mopping the bathroom floor after guy vomited his prime rib. It\u2019s a workhorse position. I worked in kitchens for years and I\u2019ve never seen a dishwasher just run the machine.", "Maybe.you were shitty at it or it was a shitty restaurant?", "Actually. You\u2019re being pointlessly pedantic and disingenuous. You say you don\u2019t have experience but you were working in a kitchen before you did the dishes. That\u2019s actually experience.", "You need to work fast and efficiently which comes with experience. It will slow stuff down because there's only so much space and you get in the way. Its not that complicated but to act like there's no skill at all is beyond ignorant. Having a dishwasher is only half the work, everything must be rinsed before going in,  dried and put away.", "Yeah, can't really say there. He could only get in the way or be of minimal help that it wouldn't be worth it.", "I didn't realize OP was saying they were going to stock and sanitize coolers when they said they would be dishwashing.  Oh, that's right, because they said dishwashing.", "or neither? and it's just an easy unskilled position?", "Nope, I was a server at the time. Didn't work in the kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut even if I did, no. The dish machine is it's own thing. Doing line cook prep work or whatever other kitchen job does not overlap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I said is true. You could pull a 14 year old with no experience off the street and they could do it.", "That's true for every single job. Someone who has been a cashier for 2 years will likely be faster and more efficient than someone who has been a cashier for 1 day. That doesn't make it a skilled job. Also, if we followed your logic, restaurants would only hire experienced dish washers. Is that true? Of course not. So let's go back to OP's case. Why can't he become a dish washer? There is no reason to suggest he can't become one unless he was missing a hand or something.", "You're an idiot if you think that. I worked as a server and I jumped in and did dishes too, for my 2 dollars an hour, But I knew my way around that kitchen I knew what needed to be done to do the job properly. \n\nNo job is easy  when they pay you minimum wage. Easy jobs are for those with money.", "He clearly has a bad attitude and doesnt know what hes in for, i wouldnt want to be responsible for bringing him into the workplace either. Yes many restaurants want skilled workers over unskilled ones, pretty obvious. Still many professions hire with no experience, literally not even an argument there just nonsense.", ">Still many professions hire with no experience, literally not even an argument there just nonsense.\n\nYes, many restaurants hire dishwashers with no experience because its not a skilled job and can be taught in like 15 minutes lmao.", "You are actually just making shit up", "I'm making up the fact that restuarants hire dishwashers with no experience? Sorry, is there a dish washer school that all dishwashers must go through before they can even consider applying to be a dish washer?"]}
