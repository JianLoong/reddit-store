{"id": 12736, "submission_id": "11waedu", "title": "AITA for saying dishwashing is unskilled labor?", "selftext": "UPDATE: After reading through some more comments I started to worry that I'd really screwed things up and I didn't want to wait until tonight to apologize. She'll didn't text me this morning to confirm our date like she usually does and I had a bad feeling.\n\nI reached out and apologized for mansplaining something she obviously knew more about and explained I was hurt by her patronizing response to my offer. She apologized profusely and thanked me again for the offer, explaining she thought I was joking and never would have reacted that way if she'd known it was being sincere. Without my prompting, she apologized for complaining so much and explained that it wasn't always a crisis situation but the bar has doubled its business in the last year and now she's burning out. The situation with her boss is stressing her out even more than anything. She's approached him several times without mincing words (I definitely believe that) and he keeps brushing her off. I now remember her telling me their oven broke in the middle of service a while back after she told him repeatedly that it needed a new part and now he claims she never said anything. It's almost hard to believe a business owner could be so in denial about a critical piece of equipment but I feel really bad that I reminded her of him.\n\nI asked if we could talk about the skilled vs unskilled labor argument tonight and she said, \"Is it okay if we don't? Things were going so well.\" I'm kind of frustrated by this because she made such a big deal out of it but I'll respect her wishes.\n\nP.S. To everyone saying I only like her because she's physically attractive and gets us attention when we go out, you have no idea. I wanted to keep the introduction short so I could get to the relevant situation but the fact is I've never met anyone like her. She has two baccalaureate degrees (Liberal Arts) and is trying to save up for grad school. She's interested in everything, is one of the funniest people I've ever met, and nothing seems to bother her outside of work. Work bothers her a lot though. I don't understand why she stays where she is when she could do whatever she wanted. As for saying I like her assertiveness (wink wink nudge nudge), it's something we both joke about. I respect the hell out of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*I've been seeing this girl for 3 months who I'm pretty into. She's a professional chef, hot, and a basically a badass. She smokes pot and drinks a lot more than me but other than that I have no complaints. She's very assertive because she has to be in her line of work and luckily I'm into that (if you know what I mean).\n\nShe works at an upscale bar (hence the drinking) where the food is really important and she's super talented so her dishes get written up in our local media which is so cool. It feels a bit like dating a celebrity when we go out because she seems to know all the \"industry\" people and we get free drinks and stuff.\n\nThe problem came up when she was complaining about her job, which she does a lot. She says her boss is unsupportive and won't hire more help for the kitchen. Right now she does almost everything herself so her hours are crazy long and she's stressed all the time. I agree it doesn't make sense to be so short staffed because it seems like the bar is always busy and they make good money. The owner is an old-school boomer guy who thinks she's overreacting (or so she says).\n\nI don't like feeling helpless when she complains about work so I offered to help wash dishes one night so she wouldn't have to work until 3am and we could go out. I made a lot of money in tech and retired early so I have some time on my hands. She looked surprised and laughed and said \"thank you for the offer\". I was kind of hoping she would turn me down but the way she said it was kinda patronizing so I pressed a bit.\n\nShe went into professional mode and asked if I'd ever washed dishes before. I said, yes, obviously, but not in a restaurant or anything. Now she looked really annoyed and asked why I thought I could just jump in and wash dishes without any experience. I laughed at this and said anyone could wash dishes. Teenagers do it as their first job. She got offended and said I didn't understand the realities of kitchen work because it's not easy and dishwashers are the most important person in the restaurant.\n\nI thought that was a huge exaggeration. I worked at a Wendy's in high school and it's the same damn skill set. What **she** does is skilled but washing dishes is not skilled labor. She said \"there's no such thing as unskilled labor\" and \"I'd take you up on your offer if I thought you wouldn't mess up service\". I thought that was really rude and misguided (no such thing as unskilled labor? Are you kidding me?) and told her so. She told me I was condescending and presumptuous and she gets enough of that from her boss. The date was awkward for a while until she smiled and changed the subject but now I can't stop wondering if her boss doesn't have a point about her overreacting.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: She specifically said she needed a dishwasher, I didn't just pick it because I thought it was easy. Sorry that was unclear.\n\nEDIT 2: All she said by way of explanation was I'd get \"run over\". I asked what made it \"skilled\" and she said I was starting a bigger conversation that she didn't want to have right then while she was upset and not entirely sober. Fair enough.\n\nEDIT 3: Wow, this was a lot to wake up to. I can't read 1000+ comments but you've given me some questions to ask her later. It sounds like \"skilled\" has different meanings and she wasn't talking about a standardized definition like I was. We haven't talked since this conversation on Thursday and she has Sunday-Monday off so she should be calm and sober when I see her tonight. I will apologize for \"mansplaining\" and see if she can explain what I'd have to do to be skilled enough to be a dishwasher. My offer was sincere AND I didn't really want to do it. Who would? It sounds miserable but I want to support her.", "created_utc": 1679292359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11waedu/aita_for_saying_dishwashing_is_unskilled_labor/", "score": 3206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You, who haven't worked in a food establishment since high school are discounting her experience.  You worked at a Wendy's which has a fixed menu,  doesn't serve food on plates with flatware and uses paper cups. Dishwashing at a fast food restaurant is not the same as at full service restaurant.  Your attempt to wash dishes \\*would\\* disrupt service at your date's restaurant.  Fitting in with a team of workers and know what to do is a key part to running a successful restaurant kitchen.  Washing dishes may be a humble position, but it's absolutely crucial to the running of the kitchen.  It's similar to engine oil in a car:  you don't realize how crucial it is until the engine seizes.\n\nYou are dating someone who works full time in a professional cooking environment and you responded as condescending AH.  OP, YTA", "I\u2019m not gonna give judgement one way or the other even though that\u2019s what this entire community is about- I\u2019m just gonna insert my own personal my experience which is that dishwashing for a high traffic restaurant is tiring as hell because you never stop moving and it\u2019s extremely uncomfortable the entire time because it\u2019s hot and humid and there\u2019s practically no down time", "YTA\n\nThere are practically no jobs that a person can jump in and do without training. That is what she meant by no job is unskilled labor. You're a snob.\n\nYou made it worse by continuing along with your insistence of demeaning a job that she finds extremely important. Without proper dishwashing, she can't do her job. She can't plate on dirty or improperly cleaned dishes. She values her dishwashers. \n\nYou could learn a little respect and not look down on jobs that you feel are beneath your high level.", "YTA. There is indeed no such thing as unskilled labor, and doing the dishes in any active restaurant is NOTHING like washing the dishes at home. This is coming from someone who has worked as a chef's assistent.\n\nYou need to work fast, you need to be organized,  you need to have a very high stress tolerance and you need to keep moving constantly. You need to keep up the pace just as much as any chef, because if you end up slacking, the dishes will build up, the chefs might not be able to put out the orders because there aren't enough plates or tools to keep cooking, and that shit happens in the blink of an eye.\n\nIt is damn near endless, especially if you're the only one doing the dishes. In most cases, you are also the one who needs to go and gather up the dishes that people leave behind in the dining area, depending on the type of restaurant. You also have to put the dishes back in their designated spots once they're clean.\n\nIt's not just about doing the dishes, it's about keeping the place running. Believe it or not, but dishwashing is one of the most important parts if you want a fully functioning kitchen.", "YTA for insincerely offering to help which she probably picked up on and decided to humble you. It's nice that she views all people working in the kitchen as equal despite what others might perceive as /better work/, that's how you know she's mindful and a team player. You claim to respect her work and status but undermine her complaining (which seems legitimate so shame on you) and her opinions, hope she sees this as the first of many red flags.", "YTA. As someone who grew up in the service industry and now works in tech\u2026 your dismissal of her concerns is typical tech attitude for service workers. \n\nDishwashing is important and skilled labor. It\u2019s not just the stuff customers use, but the chefs / line as well. Plus the dishwasher usually runs unseen duties if things are busy. Never mind if a dirty plate makes it to the front and messes up a plating before it\u2019s caught. \n\nMaybe. MAYBE. instead of taking it personally you could have asked questions to understand why it wasn\u2019t a good fit, and found another way to help.", "YTA. You insulted her and she put you in your place. She\u2019s probably right, and it\u2019s presumptuous of you to assume you understand her work environment completely.", "YTA\n\nDepending on how busy a restaurant is, turn over can be high which means you need a dishwasher who can clean those dishes quickly. Not just the dishes & utensils customers use but the ones the chefs use.", "[removed]", "YTA. Being a dishwasher in a busy restaurant is not just washing dishes. It starts with going and finding the dishes (including the cooks' dishes) and clearing them off and then putting them back correctly, and no, that doesn't mean just in one location. All that while not trying to be underfoot. Comparing a franchise \"type X\" chain fast food joint with any real restaurant is also ignorant. And if you wouldn't be the AH already, you probably should feel like one for honestly taking her boss's word over hers when considering if she's overreacting.\n\nWas that statement of hers a tiny bit exaggerated? Yes, but not much. A busy kitchen is an assembly line where everything has its precise order, place and timing. This ain't cooking at home doing the dishes when they pile up. This is more like \"spot work yourself and grab it while getting out of everybody's work\" kinda thing, so yeah, in a kitchen, the statement \"there ain't no such thing as unskilled labour\" is more often true than not.

As an ex-dishwasher, I can attest that it gets busy and can be overwhelming and a bit stressful at times but it's generally not exactly difficult - a 10-15 minute tutorial on how the dishwasher works, where the clean dishes get stacked etc is usually sufficient. Yes, it requires you to be fairly fast and use basic time-management skills but nothing your average adult can't do. Therefore, I suspect that your gf has other reasons why she doesn't want to work with you.

You cant fix all her problems.", "YTA. There is no unskilled labor. And dishes in a restaurant kitchen are different from dishes at home.", "YTA. It may be labour that requires minimal training, but there is barely any job, no matter how menial, that can be truly called \"unskilled\". I've never washed dishes or flipped burgers for a living, I did everything I could to avoid food service, because I've seen how fast and hard they work, and just how dangerous a commercial kitchen can be, and I didn't want a bar of it.\n\nThink this any time you think of anything as \"unskilled labour\": could you do it? Maybe. Could you do it as effectively, quickly, and consistently as someone who has literally been doing it for a living for years? Probably not, but hey, maybe you're a natural it's your true calling. Could you do it quickly, effectively, consistently, with an asshole boss and asshole clients screaming at you daily, and still front up to do it the next day? Do you have the mental fortitude for that? Probably not.", "YTA for assuming you knew better. \n\nIf her saying what she said about dishwashing in a restaurant kitchen surprised you, you should have asked WHY and learnt something new instead of dismissing her outright based on \u2026 what exactly?

He's probably got her on salary and she still gets the job done so there's no problem on his end. She's probably worked every station in multiple kitchens and her share of dishes to boot.

She's a professional chef, hot, and a basically a badass. She smokes pot and drinks a lot more than me but other than that I have no complaints. She's very assertive because she has to be in her line of work and luckily I'm into that (if you know what I mean).\n\nShe works at an upscale bar (hence the drinking) where the food is really important and she's super talented so her dishes get written up in our local media which is so cool. It feels a bit like dating a celebrity when we go out because she seems to know all the \"industry\" people and we get free drinks and stuff.\n\nThe problem came up when she was complaining about her job, which she does a lot. She says her boss is unsupportive and won't hire more help for the kitchen. Right now she does almost everything herself so her hours are crazy long and she's stressed all the time. I agree it doesn't make sense to be so short staffed because it seems like the bar is always busy and they make good money. The owner is an old-school boomer guy who thinks she's overreacting (or so she says).\n\nI don't like feeling helpless when she complains about work so I offered to help wash dishes one night so she wouldn't have to work until 3am and we could go out. I made a lot of money in tech and retired early so I have some time on my hands. She looked surprised and laughed and said \"thank you for the offer\". I was kind of hoping she would turn me down but the way she said it was kinda patronizing so I pressed a bit.\n\nShe went into professional mode and asked if I'd ever washed dishes before. I said, yes, obviously, but not in a restaurant or anything. Now she looked really annoyed and asked why I thought I could just jump in and wash dishes without any experience. I laughed at this and said anyone could wash dishes. Teenagers do it as their first job. She got offended and said I didn't understand the realities of kitchen work because it's not easy and dishwashers are the most important person in the restaurant.\n\nI thought that was a huge exaggeration. I worked at a Wendy's in high school and it's the same damn skill set. What **she** does is skilled but washing dishes is not skilled labor. She said \"there's no such thing as unskilled labor\" and \"I'd take you up on your offer if I thought you wouldn't mess up service\". I thought that was really rude and misguided (no such thing as unskilled labor? Are you kidding me?) and told her so. She told me I was condescending and presumptuous and she gets enough of that from her boss.

What chemicals and cleansers are used? do certain dishes need to be washed in batches together?\n\nAt my (comparatively simple, dishes-wise) job, all our dishes are either stainless steel or plastic. However we get different batches of dishes at different times of the day, and while some are perfectly fine in a simple three-stage wash process, some need to be soaked in hot soapy water before washing can begin. Others need to be soaked with a more aggressive chemical before they can be scrubbed; however, those specific items then must also be thoroughly cleaned of the chemical before entering them into the main three-stage wash process. Certain items are direct food-contact items, and require a separate wash process with a different sanitizer. Twice a week we fully disassemble our ice cream machine for cleaning, and that requires its own unique wash proccess because there are both non-food-contact parts with machine grease that must be cleaned without gunking up anything else, and food-contact parts that are submerged in the food product and must therefore be cleaned and sanitized in a food-safe manner. \n\nAll of this is stuff anyone can *learn*, but it's not something anyone can just walk in off the street and *do* without guidance, direction, or training.

You can't cook without clean cookware, you can't serve without clean flatware, and you can't clean more dirty things if your sinks, drying racks, etc are already full. the right items have to be constantly moving at the correct time, and having a sense for that timing is a SKILL.", "I laughed at the comparison to Wendy's.

In classifying these occupations, we use materials published by the Department of Labor. When we make disability determinations under this subpart, we use the following definitions:\r  \n\r  \n(a) Unskilled work. Unskilled work is work which needs little or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time. The job may or may not require considerable strength. For example, we consider jobs unskilled if the primary work duties are handling, feeding and offbearing (that is, placing or removing materials from machines which are automatic or operated by others), or machine tending, and a person can usually learn to do the job in 30 days, and little specific vocational preparation and judgment are needed. A person does not gain work skills by doing unskilled jobs.\r  \n\r  \n(b) Semi-skilled work. Semi-skilled work is work which needs some skills but does not require doing the more complex work duties. Semi-skilled jobs may require alertness and close attention to watching machine processes; or inspecting, testing or otherwise looking for irregularities; or tending or guarding equipment, property, materials, or persons against loss, damage or injury; or other types of activities which are similarly less complex than skilled work, but more complex than unskilled work. A job may be classified as semi-skilled where coordination and dexterity are necessary, as when hands or feet must be moved quickly to do repetitive tasks.\r  \n\r  \n(c) Skilled work. Skilled work requires qualifications in which a person uses judgment to determine the machine and manual operations to be performed in order to obtain the proper form, quality, or quantity of material to be produced. Skilled work may require laying out work, estimating quality, determining the suitability and needed quantities of materials, making precise measurements, reading blueprints or other specifications, or making necessary computations or mechanical adjustments to control or regulate the work. Other skilled jobs may require dealing with people, facts, or figures or abstract ideas at a high level of complexity.", "Well almost everyone needs to be trained or instructed in some way shape or form on how to do everything.

We don't understand how doing a thing for three hours requires fewer skills than doing the same thing for 10-14 hours straight.", "What restaurant has a dishwasher on staff for 14 hours? Or even 10? Especially if it's higher scale restaurant, the service will only last for ~6 hours.\n\nYou have no idea what you are talking about.", "This is true. I'm about to finish my PhD in Dishwashing.", "Our dishwasher walked out in the middle of service. No one realized what happened until we ran out of plates (middle of a huge Saturday night). \n\nSlammed the brakes on service, right there. I ended up giving up most of my waiting shift to wash dishes after I couldn\u2019t find a single clean fork to give to one of my tables.", "I had a BF like that. \u201cI love smart women who know their shit and have strong opinions!\u201d Until I knew my shit and had a strong opinion about some stupid-ass thing HE said. And strangely he had no problem acknowledging my intelligence one minute and then challenging it the next. He wanted me to upgrade his business website since that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for the last 25 years, and as I started taking him through the process, he kept trying to tell me that we first needed to focus on a certain part of his site\u2014which was not a first priority when you\u2019re doing a redesign. He goes, \u201dDo you even know what a keyword is?!\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cWhat is it then?\u201d\n\nHE. QUIZZED. ME. This man is a massage therapist with a high school diploma and he thought HE could quiz ME about what my job is. That was a very short relationship.\n\nMoral of the story: There\u2019s always some a-hole who, even if they brag about how much of a pro you are, will invariably consider you less good at your job than they would be the first time they even walked through the door.", "See, that's what I'm saying, and I keep having people act like I'm saying she had to say yes. It's not that she didn't want him in there it's that he offered to do something that he didn't want to do amd has no obligation to even offer so that she could get out of work on time one day and she responded by laughing at him. People act like he's wrong for keeping it going, but if someone  offered someone help and they laughed, I think most people would ask why. Then they want to say he's demeaning her job by saying it's easy but completely overlooking that she is demeaning him by saying he couldn't do it and couldn't handle it. Dude offered help and she didn't just say no she laughed at him and then when he inquired about it she told him he would be unable to do her work basically, I don't see how that isn't her having an ego by basically saying you can't do what I do. It's not like he said go chill ill do the cooking and no one will notice the difference he offered to do dishes to help her.", "She says it wouldn\u2019t be helpful for him to come wash dishes for one night, and she\u2019s the only one with experience in her exact job- I don\u2019t know why we shouldn\u2019t believe her.", "This. I used to be a dishwasher at a restaurant and it's not only washing dishes lol. I had to train a lot of new colleagues and it took many days for them to catch up. Though I think an adult learns faster than a 15 year old, but still not in 1 day.", "It goes along with the last line about her boss maybe having a point. They disagree, and that's IMMEDIATELY where his minds goes: \"Women, eh?\"", "And yet people still use it to undermine work they don't value.", "My cast iron is enameled so technically it could go in the dishwasher but if I saw anyone in my family put it there, I\u2019d probably brain them with it.", "He has to open the door to come in and turning the knob is a skill!", "And OP REEEAAAAAALLLLY needs us to know he's rich because he \"made a lot of money in tech and retired early\", which, if true, likely means he got lucky, worked for the right startup, and sold his stock options after the IPO.", "It has nothing to do with the worker at all, nor wages\n\nAll it means is that its possible to train someone for the job who has no prior experience in a reasonable amount of time\n\nWhere tf are all these fake definitions coming from", "You can only mansplain if you\u2019re a man. It\u2019s right there in the name! \n\n-me, womansplaining mansplaining", "Finally someone said. Dude even said that one of his complaints is that she out smokes and out drinks him. Like what? Can't handle being \"out performed\"? \ud83d\ude02", "The term has literally nothing to do with how skilled the person doing the job is, it relates to how quickly you can teach someone on the job with no prior experience.\n\nDishwashing is a skill.\n\nDishwashing is an unskilled job.\n\nYou can still be a skilled dishwasher, because even if its something that someone can be exceptional at, you can teach someone to do it effectively within a few weeks.", "I think the major issue is that certain people are using \"unskilled labor\" to mean \"not worth paying\". Like, barely worth paying min wage, and really, they should be doing it for the \"experience\" since they're so \"unskilled\".\n\nI err on the side of no unskilled labor because, really. Throw in a newbie at Wendy's on a rush Friday night vs. the person that's been there 3 years? And there is a huge chasm of difference between their skill sets. So when people say there's no \"unskilled labor\", I take it as 'there is no work that shouldn't be compensated fairly and well for taking LITERAL HOURS of their life to do set tasks'.\n\nSo while I understand the difference you're trying to make, too much media has been tossing around \"unskilled labor\" to mean 'no pay, no value, barely worth having around'. It sounds like that's what most of this debate is coming down to. Maybe a better differentiation would be 'skilled labor' (can be taught in a few weeks of training to do decently) vs 'technical labor' (needs specialized training/schooling/credentials/experience)."]}
