I pretty much always assume im on speaker if someone is driving", "NTA - I agree that he should be the one to tell you, \"Hey I have X in the car and you're on speakerphone.\" But for your own sake I would just assume that you are always on speakerphone that way nothing you say can be taken out of context and used against you.", "You shoulda just told your son he\u2019d be grounded longer if he didn\u2019t stop whining instead of just arguing", "NTA.
