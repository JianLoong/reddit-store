And very grateful to vomit_entrepeneurnfor actually finding the post \n\n\n\n\nI've spent a lot of time trying to find this comment or even the post it was on - but have failed. The central post was about a couple planning their wedding and the groom's mother kept making the major decisions with the groom's support even though she wasn't financially contributing to the wedding. The comment was from a poster who asked the OP (the bride to be) to write down a list of the long term couples they knew where one partners needs and wants always dominate (the parameters might have been a little different) and then think if they wanted to do that to themselves and how a potential kid would be impacted by that. I'm missing some of the specifics here but I wish I could find it because it was so good", "This is adorable. I hope they\u2019re together. I require updates! \n\n(Also, this thread really effectively showcases how incorrect AITA commenters\u2019 assumptions can be sometimes. A lot of comments assuming the worst in OP and that he made her uncomfortable, she doesn\u2019t want to be saddled with his kids, etc. Folks really make leaps sometimes when there isn\u2019t enough context. Would love to see INFO used more often.)", "LOL thank you. Just goes to show my time spent on Reddit perusing things when I'm half asleep *is* useful!", "This was/is an adventure.", "Nothing could possibly beat this one!", "This one is up for every single positive award.

Basically, from what I recall, the OP's daughter was getting married and only she (the mom) and daughter knew that the daughter had transitioned from male to female.

What really tripped me out, was he said \"9 months\" and he kissed her and shit got weird. Also, that she was a widow. I remembered her TIFU, because my husband and I talked about that sort of thing. He almost died 4 years ago due to a  misdiagnosis. I always told him, I'd be done. I'd be just like Hope. Never wanting anyone else, because what I have is just fucking perfect.
