Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.\n\n\nFyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that! \n\nFor example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.\n\n\nLast night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was \"bonkers\" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some \"explicit\" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such \"demand\" and be pushy still.\n\n\nThis morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.\n\n\nAnthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.", "created_utc": 1667251988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiplwk/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_move_a_picture_of/", "score": 9976, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I was your friend, I would have kicked her to the curb for her entitled self absorbed attitude.

No wonder why there were issues between her and your mother.", "YTA - first your wife had issues with your Mom, now she\u2019s having issues with Anthony\u2026sounds like your wife is the real issue. From your title I was expecting your hosts to have a semi-nude or nude portrait in the guest room. But, no, she\u2019s freaking out over a standard wedding kiss pose in the hallway? Please, child! You need to hurry & get your own place. I think you\u2019re lucky Anthony didn\u2019t ask you to leave immediately.", "YTA and this is a deeply unreasonable request from your wife. I simply do not know what else to tell you", "YTA and so is your wife.\n\nYou\u2019re in *their* home. Your friend is doing you a huge favour and this is what he gets in return?

It was *she* who didn't shut the door, for Pete's sake. \n\nIf I were you I'd start packing, because Anthony is about to throw you guys out.", "YTA. If this is Dahlia's reaction to pictures of a wedding kiss and accidentally drinking out of someone's glass, she is not just \"conservative,\" she is in need of therapy. (I am even wondering if she was molested or abused in some way.)\n\nDidn't you kiss at your own wedding?\n\nAnthony is doing you a big favor to let you stay with him. You're being unreasonable to think he should comply with your wife's phobia.", "If your wife is uncomfortable with images of someone kissing, wait until she finds out where babies come from. \n\nYTA - Your wife is being bonkers, and you are both being horrible to a friend who has saved you from potential homelessness.", "YTA Let me guess, the issues you had staying with your mother had everything to do with your wife being absolutely ridiculous? This isn't about being from a \"conservative home,\" so what is really going on here? Was she raised in a cult, is she affiliated with some fringe religious group?\n\nSeriously, you're staying in THEIR home and throwing a fit over him... Kissing his wife in a photo? And your wife is throwing a fit and refusing to leave her room until they take down their perfectly normal wedding photo?\n\nAnd your comment about just doing it to keep guests happy is so baffling given the situation. Like, the photo isn't the issue here. And it's not the only problem that's already happened. So, your wife also freaked out after accidentally taking a sip of his water, does this mean he's also not supposed to drink water in his own home to keep her comfortable? And then she got all upset because he had the audacity to walk past the door, which she had left open, while she just happened to be sitting on the bed. So, he's also not allowed to walk through his home. What else is he not going to be allowed to do in his own house, breathe?\n\nIt would be bad enough if you were just guests that were visiting for a weekend, but this guy was extremely generous to allow the two of you to stay there while you figure out your financial burden. You're not even guests in the traditional sense, you're basically just roommates who aren't contributing financially. And this is how you treat him for taking you into his home?\n\nWhat is really going on with your wife? And why are you enabling this atrocious behavior and extreme entitlement? You letting her continue with her childish tantrum, in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME, is making you as much of an asshole as your wife. Though, I do wonder if there's an underlying mental illness behind your wife's behavior.\n\nYou keep this up you're going to need another place to stay. And I'm sure that your wife will inevitably get you kicked out of the next place, and the place after that.", "YTA. This isn't about accommodating a guest's reasonable, or only mildly unreasonable, preferences. Your wife's discomfort with a picture of a kiss is so far beyond the norm that no host should reasonably be expected to accommodate her. You say 'conservative home' but it sounds rather more than that. Might therapy help her to adjust to a more 'usual' societal norm? \n\nAnd you are TA also because you sound much more aware than her of how odd her behaviour is, and yet you're trying to defend her. When someone is unreasonable, their spouse is not honour bound to defend them. It sounds as though it would be a lot kinder for you to explain to her that her reactions are out of whack, and she's the person who needs to be more flexible and accommodating.", "YTA for even entertaining your wife\u2019s bullshit.\n\nYou are guests in **his** home, she\u2019s throwing a toddler level tantrum over a photo of a wedding kiss. Can you not see how absolutely ridiculous that is?\n\nIf you\u2019re prepared to cater to her foolishness then good for you, no one else is obligated to tolerate it.", "Your wife needs to get a grip.\n\nYou are homeless, she has already got you kicked out of your mothers, and now she is being ridiculously prudish about a picture of a fully clothed married couple in their own home.\n\nIf she doesn't want him to see her lying down she should shut the door.  \n\nYTA for enabling this.", "YTA. If I was Anthony I\u2019d have already asked you to leave.", "YTA. I don't care if it's a full frontal nude on the wall. Beggars don't get to be choosers. If it bothers your wife so much then leave. \n\nYour friend is being incredibly generous by letting you stay there. Your wife's request is beyond unreasonable.", "YTA. This is bizarre. And I guess now we know why Dahlia and mom \"had issues.\" Dahlia sounds like a nightmare guest who expects everyone to tiptoe around and cater to her anxiety (instead of maybe potentially getting therapy considering most of the examples are stuff she's done to herself...like, just close the door?) and OP is enabling it and making his generous friend feel like he's an AH. Staying in someone else's home and refusing to come out of the room you're using is super rude. If I were the friend I would say, sorry this isn't working out and you both need to go.", "YTA. The only thing I would move, if I was him is you and your wife out his house.  It's clear that something is total wrong with your wife.", ">I asked him to be a little more considerate\n\nYou *what*? More considerate than letting you stay in his home? YTA. And Dahlia is T A.\n\nAnthony is a saint.", "YTA. Your wife is acting creepy toward your friend, who is doing you a solid by letting you stay in his home.", "YTA. You\u2019re not invited guests - he\u2019s doing you both a favour. \n\nYour wife is incredibly entitled and spoiled to behave so abominably in someone else\u2019s house. Over a wedding kiss picture?! It\u2019s not a reasonable request - as you seem to realise - stop defending her, tell her to stop instead of enabling her.\n\nYou should both leave his home if you can\u2019t behave.", "YTA, but so\u2019s your wife. You couldn\u2019t stay with your mom because of your wife, now you are driving a wedge with your friend who is letting you stay in his home. Your wife really needs to get a grip.", "YTA. Even if he had nudes hanging on the wall, it's his house which you are staying in for free. Maybe your wife needs to live in the car a while to get a grip. She should probably black out all the windows just in case passersby engage in PDA in range of her virgin eyes.", "What?!?! You two don't have a home. You to are guests in someone else's house. And Dahlia wants the house adjusted to her wishes?!?! I have a surprise for her: The world does not revolve around your absurd ideas and boundaries. She is a dictator, and you are her messenger-boy. What happened to your self esteem? Your mom, this friend....they won't be the last you loose over this princess.", "YTA and your wife is too.  Seriously she needs help if that photo is bothering her.  I can't believe you even asked your friend that.  You may be living on the streets shortly.", "YTA. You and Dahlia are guests in his home. Yes, it's quite rude to ask him to move a perfectly ordinary picture. No, she doesn't get to use \"feeling uncomfortable\" as a way to control someone else's home, even if she is temporarily staying in it.", "YTA, your friend is very kindly opening his house to you both in your time of need and you're demanding he redecorate because of your wife's insane neuroses?\n\nAnd you couldn't stay at your parents because \"issues\" arose between your mom and your wife? Do you see the common denominator here? Dahlia has to grow up and deal with whatever is going on with herself or you are rapidly going to run out of people willing to tolerate her bullshit and your enabling of it.", "Your wife needs a therapist and you gotta stop enabling this weird stuff.\nYeah, i doubt this is about religion or being conservative.

Dahlia vs friend\n\nDahlia needs to be alone", "YTA\u2026 maybe you need to explain to your delicate little flower that she\u2019ll see a lot more than that and have a lot less privacy when you\u2019re living on the streets.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s HIS house and your wife has NO REASON to complain. He\u2019s doing you guys a serious favor by allowing you to crash at his place and you and your wife are being serious AHs to him with your behavior and unreasonable demands.\n\nYou and your wife need to grow up and apologize to Anthony.", "YTA! You\u2019re a guest in his home! He is doing you a FAVOR! If the picture bothers you or your wife that much then you two need to LEAVE! You don\u2019t get to dictate decor in HIS HOME!", "YTA and Dahlia an even bigger one.\n\nYou are GUESTS in the house and should not be making demands regarding normal pictures hung on the wall.  You can ask and your friend said no.  End of conversation.\n\nIf it is too much for you and Dahlia to handle, then go find somewhere else to live.  Might want to start looking anyway cuz this guy is probably had enough of you and Dahlia.\n\nYour wife has some major issues and hang-ups that she should seek therapy for.  Her idea of out of bounds behavior is very abnormal cuz the behaviors she finds disturbing are normal.", "YTA\n\nit is bonkers, even if it was in the living room under a spotlight there would be no need for him to move a picture in his own home. You and your wife should not be staying with anyone if she is going to have such intense issues over nothing.", "YTA It\u2019s his house he is letting you stay at rent free. It\u2019s not a naked picture of him and his wife - it\u2019s their wedding kiss photo! If everyone is having problems with your wife, pretty sure she\u2019s the problem. She\u2019s ridiculous for not coming out of her room and sounds like a drama queen.", "YTA. You are pretty demanding for a guy who\u2019s freeloading at his mom\u2019s and best friend\u2019s house. When you can pay rent you can decorate.", "YTA. You and your wife are so incredibly entitled in this situation. He is housing you both for, I assume, free or near as can be, and you feel you can make demands as ridiculous as this.\n\nAlso, I understand conservative or sheltered, but this seems a concerning level of \"shy\". Your wife cannot lead her life incapable of viewing others' mild intimacy.", "YTA. Tell your wife to grow up. Not everything in the world is going to cave to her weird sense of fragility. You left your mom's house, and your friend was kind.. I mean like KIND.. selfless to let you stay at his place and your wife is acting like a toddler. If I were a betting woman, I'd say y'all are going to be kicked out of this home too. Your wife is not entitled to change their decorations or tell them what to do in their home. I woulda kicked you out. \n\nLove the way you said \"if it were me I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.\" How about, \"if it were me I'd go out of my way, 20 miles to make sure I'm not YTA and making the people who are giving me a roof over my head hell.\"", "YTA.  The issue clearly isn't your mom or your friend.  It's your wife.  Dude, standing by your spouse doesn't include when they are being a holy terror.  Her upbringing is her problem.  Not everyone else's.  You guys are currently homeless, and can't really afford to be pissing off the people who are kind enough to open their homes to you.  Tell your wife to stop being so judgmental, or yall will be sleeping in your car until you can afford to find a place to rent.", "Dahlia is having a wonderful influence on your life, isn\u2019t she! She\u2019s not shy; she\u2019s demanding and obnoxious. If you keep caving in to her weird demands you\u2019ll be lucky to have any friends left. YTA and grow a pair!", "YTA\n\nThat last line, I think you\u2019re misinterpreting being a pushover as hospitable. I\u2019m from a very hospitable culture and raised to really go too far for guests. We are also raised to be good guests in equal effort. \n\nNow to clear things up for you. Your wife is the AH, you\u2019re her enabler. Your friend is too polite to tell you, and hoped you were less obtuse and understood his eye roll up until this latest request. \n\nYour friend doesn\u2019t understand her, he\u2019s being nice. She doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nShe has issues with everyone around you.\n\nWake up", "OMG dude---YTA\n\nAnd your wife is a bit nuts.\n\nYour friend is doing you a HUGE FAVOR by allowing the two of you to stay in his home--HIS HOME. You need to tell your wife that when you are in a position like this, she is in NO POSITION to ask people to change anything about their home because it makes her uncomfortable. She needs to no look at the photo. THAT IS THE END OF IT. \n\nYou are not going to get any support here for this. You are 100% wrong to keep pushing this, and if you continue you will wind up not only losing the place to stay, but you will lose this couple as friends, and they seem like good people.\n\nThere is being conservative, and then there is becoming uncomfortable with completely normal photos of two MARRIED PEOPLE kissing. There is nothing that could even be construed to be immoral or improper about it. \n\nGet her some therapy.", "YTA\n\nand your wife needs therapy. \nThat is not conservative that is bonkers.", "YTA.  Your Dahlia is being a stinkweed.  She should be bending over backwards to be gracious and kind to Anthony for taking you both in.  But she seems to feel that she has the right to dominate how things are in Anthony's home.  \n\nLet me let you in on a little secret.  Anthony wishes you would leave.  Who wouldn't?  It started he was just doing you a favor.  Now he has discovered that he has moved into Dahlia's World.  When men and women don't kiss.  And drinking glasses wear special abayas to prevent any kind of contact.  (Sidebar:  Does Dahlia think she could get pregnant from Anthony's saliva?   Just a question.)  Where women don't lay down unless they are as guarded as Fort Knox (How DARE Anthony walk down the hallway in his own apartment?

Time to move in with Dahlias family so she's more comfortable.", "YTA. Your wife has issues. She is getting overly upset about stuff that does not matter to most regular human beings.

Expecting everyone else to consider every uncomfortable feeling your wife has and expecting them to move according to her whims is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nYou are in a home that is not yours.

It's a damn picture. Also it's not porn. What's next? Your wife tells everyone that she meets that PDA is a big no-no...there's a line between being comfortable and making the place homey.

Her behaviour is unreasonable, as is yours. Don\u2019t be surprised when he kicks you out.", "YTA. The ones that need to be considerate here are you and Dahlia. I don't care how conservative her upbringing was; you do not, as a guest, stay in someone's home and ask them to alter their decor. It's a kiss at a wedding that his wife hung up. Is she also going to flip out if a married couple share a quick peck between each other? How sex-avoidant is she? This goes beyond conservatism and into something really creepy, tbh. Dahlia has some serious balls on her to demand anything from your friend, let alone 'I don't want to see you guys kissing chastely in a cherished picture'. \n\nIt's a big ask for Anthony because where does it stop, OP? Your lady has some super odd hangups  that she's shoving onto everyone around her and that's not okay. I think there's a reason you can't stay with your mom. You and her need to have a sit down talk if she can't even stand leaving her room because of a picture of fully covered non-nude married people sharing a loving kiss. Jesus. She needs therapy.

These sound like the kind of guests who leave their dirty dishes everywhere and make demands about what you cook for dinner. \n\nYTA op and so is your wife. You are living off of someone's generosity and they are the ones who set the house rules, not you. Tell your wife to get over herself.", "I grew up fundie and it would have been seriously frowned upon to have kissing pictures. I was super uncomfortable even seeing adults kiss, it felt pornographic.  \n\nShe\u2019s TA. Even if this is the case for her, get therapy.

I find it hard to believe these two will be staying much longer, but I can't get over how hilarious her reaction is going to be to them doing something as simple as a quick peck hello when she comes home.\n\nI legitimately do not know if this is a mental health crisis, or if she grew up in an extreme household where this is what she was taught was normal, though I suspect it has to be both.\n\nAnd I can't get over the fact that OP, like you mentioned, just thinks everyone should cater to her and her insane demands. Like, this is a serious problem and enabling her is surely part of how it got to this point How can he honestly type all of this information out and think his friend might be the asshole in this situation!?\n\nAnd his brushing it off as her being from a \"conservative household\" is so eerily similar to people who just brush off the most toxic, abusive behavior because someone is from a \"very traditional household.\"\n\nHow can someone be so oblivious to how disturbing and unreasonable this behavior actually is? Part of me hopes the responses here are the wake-up call that OP so desperately needs.", "\u201cDo you think your wife could move out so she doesn\u2019t make my wife uncomfortable with her PDA?

She\u2019s going to have to get over herself", "Yeah I hate to say it but my drama llama is begging me to find out what happened with the mom. I'm sure I'll never know, though, so the damn thing will just have to starve", "That really got me. I mean, the audacity of Anthony to\u2026walk past an open doorway in his own home?", "If I was Anthony I\u2019d tell them they can move back to OP\u2019s mom\u2019s house. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous behaviour.

People might be *holding hands* in the street", "If she's that upset by a married couple kissing, how can they have kids?", "Yeah I think OP really sugar-coated \u201cfull blown cult\u201d with \u201cconservative\u201d bc, Jesus Christ", "Yeah, OP is king of the understatement in this post: \"Issues began to arise\" and \"she might just be over reacting,\" so I doubt we'd get the whole story", "Yeah, I'm guessing that it's similar issues to what's happening now. Mom was refusing to bend over backwards for OP and wife. But I'm guessing that because it was OP's mom wife had no issue talking to mom directly. It seems like wife has conservative enough opinions that she feels she can't confront OP's friend directly.", "I'm seeing Dahlia behaving exactly the same way with the mother, until she had too much and kicked them out.\n\nOP and his wife are going to be going around friends and family for a while, with the situation repeating itself until they run out of options.", "I\u2019m creeped out by how weird OP\u2019s wife is about this\u2026 I also wanna know why they can\u2019t stay with his mom.", "Yeah I really can\u2019t think of any reason she\u2019d be so bothered by this photo.

She's 28, unless she grew up in a tiny sect (or cult) and **just** got out I find it hard to believe she thinks 1) getting upset because someone walked by while she was lying down with the door open, while staying in someone else's home and 2) getting upset because someone has what seems to be a very basic wedding picture framed in their home, that she is staying in, and won't take it down is in any way shape or form normal behavior. Add to that the fact that she refused to leave their room, IN THE HOME OF SOMEONE WHO IS LETTING THEM STAY THERE WHILE THEY ARE HOMELESS, screams tantrum to me. \n\nSounds like she's already gotten them kicked out of his mother's place, I have to wonder if she's intentionally getting upset about things and asking the husband to fix them while knowing that the conversation absolutely cannot go well.
