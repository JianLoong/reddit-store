We\u2019ve been here about three weeks now and she won\u2019t properly sort her trash and recycling.\n\nThe system is very clear and was explained twice during orientation.  For some reason, Patty refuses to do it; she just throws everything into one bag despite me having separate, clearly-labeled bags and trash cans.  At the start of week 2, I gently prompted her to sort her trash better, and she said she was confused, so I explained the system again.  It\u2019s the end of week 3 and the final straw was today:  I saw Patty\u2019s plastic strawberry container crammed in the half-full cardboard bin, instead of the plastic bin, which was also half-full and right next to it.  I again mentioned that plastic goes with plastic, and she again said she got confused, and I explained it again.\n\nI know Patty is smart.  Patty, like me, goes to a reputable college and needed great grades to study abroad in the first place.  I checked out her LinkedIn when we first assigned as roommates and saw that she\u2019s an HSF Scholar, is majoring in psychology with a concentration in community engagement and social change, and has been an HCOP social work student and an editorial translation intern for the Institute for Solution-Focused Therapy.  I know she\u2019s capable of understanding recycling - she\u2019s just not doing it.  Which is very contradictory considering her area of study. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole.  After she said the two half-full bins confused her after four total explanations, I decided to recycle the old labels and make up cute new ones that\u2019ll simplify things as much as possible.  For example, \u201cPLASTICS\u201d is now \u201cPLASTICS:  juice & milk cartons, packaging, etc.\u201d and \u201cI might need a quick sink shower before you recycle me!\u201d with a lil drawing of a sponge and towel.  When Patty came home and saw the labels, she got mad and told me I was an asshole for patronizing her and treating her like a child.  I told her I was just being a helpful roommate, since recycling confused her so much.  I personally consider myself quite clever and fair for this one:  she\u2018s pretending to be incompetent, so I\u2019m going to treat her like she is.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for helping my confused roommate?", "created_utc": 1694263584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e4vwp/aita_for_helping_my_confused_roommate/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is not \"confused.\"  She's lazy.  Bet her parents have always done everything for her.  \n\nRules about trash are very strict in most western European countries.  Garbage companies often don't collect trash if it is not sorted correctly and that means someone else (whose life is probably much less privileged than Patty's) has to do it.  And I bet I know what that person will be telling the bosses at the university about what it's like to deal with students from your country.\n\nAlso, cleaners aren't treated like dirt in most western European countries.  If they complain about the situation with your room's trash, they will probably be listened to.  You shouldn't have to sort it either.  Patty needs to get it together.\n\nPatty owes YOU an apology.  You were a lot more patient than I would have been.  You're roommates and when she does something lazy and obnoxious with the trash, it reflects on both of you.", "NTA at all!! How can she not tell that a plastic container goes in the bin with the other plastic stuff? How stupid and ignorant does she want to be?", "NTA. I live in Denmark, and the recycling rules are not hard to understand. The new recycling system even came with stickers with examples of what goes where. You've been very patient with her, and the new stickers actually sound pretty cute. It sounds like she's choosing to be lazy and difficult \u2013 if not just difficult. I would semi-understand if she didn't know where to put something and then threw it in the bin for the things that won't be recycled, but throwing out a plastic container in the cardboard bin? Does she not like you?", "NTA, sounds like the best way to handle it, probably just too lazy. \n\nMy grandma's boyfriend actually took pictures of what goes with what (my grandma was an awesome person with a heart of gold, but genuinely didn't understand recycling). He had scolded her so many times and got tired of it, so he made pictures and put them on the bins. We all thought it was condescending, but my grandma actually started doing it right and they never fought about it again. I miss both of them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had roommates who refused to load the dishwasher properly and argued that it didn't matter as it all got clean anyway and they didn't have to do it \"my way.\" (This despite the fact it was my apartment and my diswasher, and they had never owned one.)  OK well your cups are flipping over and filling with water and you are loading stuff in a way that blocks the spray arm, so some stuff is not actually getting clean....  Finally I dug out the owner's manual, opened it to the loading instructions, and placed it on the counter above the dishwasher, with a note that said \"It's not MY way, it's THE way.\"  Fortunately for me, they didn't get offended, and started loading it properly.", "NTA \n\nShe wants to claim incompetence, this is a thoughtful solution.", "YTA. Creating new labels without Patty's consent came across as condescending. It's important to have open communication about shared living spaces and work together to find solutions, rather than assuming she's incompetent.", "NTA\n\nI  watched a video of how recycling works in Japan, y'all getting off easy in Europe.  They even have to buy special bags for some of the trash...", "You\u2019re so right about her parents doing everything for her.  The other day, she had a friend over and they were trying to figure out how to book a hostel.  I shit you not, the friend said \u201cIt says name on the card\u2026 Why does it want MY name?  My dad is the one who pays!\u201d and then Patty said, \u201cYeah, and which numbers go where?\u201d.  They\u2019re 20 years old in a foreign country and don\u2019t know how to input credit card details online.  It\u2019s goddamn unbelievable.\n\nI\u2019m one of the few middle class people in this program; I needed a lot of financial aid to afford this.  Patty is part of the 98% of the program that\u2019s rich and spoiled as hell.  She\u2019s literally living in the kitchen/common area of our dorm apartment because she doesn\u2019t want to share the bedroom with me because she\u2019s apparently never shared a bedroom before.  I\u2019m one of those people that learns the cafeteria workers\u2019 names at my college and leaves snacks out for delivery people; she\u2019s one of those performative activists that\u2018s never actually interacted with the people she claims to support.", "Also can I just say I love the respect for the environment and for workers here?  It\u2019s so much better than America.  I love that I\u2019m living somewhere where pretty much everything can be recycled/reused!", "It's called \"weaponized incompetence\"", "I honestly can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s just upset she\u2019s sharing a space because she\u2019s apparently never shared with a roommate like this before, or if it\u2019s me specifically.  I\u2019m demographically different than her (and most of the program):  I\u2019m middle class, she\u2019s upper class; I\u2019m from Georgia, she\u2019s from Massachusetts; I\u2019m Jewish, she\u2019s one of those uber-Christians that kneels beside the bed; I\u2019m queer; I\u2019m all about feminine rights, she\u2019s ashamed of bras (despite wearing them) and is weirded out by me hanging mine up to dry; I\u2019m meeting locals, she\u2019s staying with the people here also from her college; etc..\nShe\u2019s literally living in the kitchen/common area because she didn\u2019t want to share the bedroom with me.", "Visual learners are a real thing.  Apparently Grandma is a visual learner.", "NTA.  Sounds like she needs to switch her major.  She clearly isn\u2019t into it.", "NTA\nA clear case of weaponised incompetance. Patty wants to act like she's too stupid to understand so that you will fix it.. But you fixed it by making everything very clear so she can't claim she doesn't understand and she's annoyed she will actually have to put in the work now.", "id say what you did was cute and helpful. hell, my government did this and i was mindblown how much a little effort helped alot.\n\nNTA, you mate needs to get over herself", "NTA. I love it! In my family also, there is a college-educated person of middle years who needs the trash explained every time. Congratulations on using nursery school labeling as operant conditioning.\n\nAnd by the way, your roommate is just lazy.", "It's clear the two of you don't mesh. You seem to be kind and quite patient IMO. Can you get a new roommate?", "ESH:  She for obvious reasons.  You for paying way too much attention to her and her drama.  You are in Copen Freaking Hagen and you are worried about her recycling?   And posting on Reddit?  Get out there, see the sites and make some friends.", "NTA. You should have told her she is incompetent if she keeps getting confused by the recycling.", "Nta for calling her bluff", ">she\u2018s pretending to be incompetent, so I\u2019m going to treat her like she is.\n\nJustified asshole! And hilarious.", "Nta and nicely done. If she doesn't like being treated like a child she shouldn't act like one.", "NTA. She\u2019s being obnoxious. It is simple.", "Don't know how it is in Japan, but here (Netherlands) we have different bags for plastics, decomposable waste (decomposable bags) and bags for non-recycable waste. I guess you could also count paper bags for paper/cardboard.", "Oh she\u2019s [her parents] rich?\n\nYeah that explains everything.", "Yes and it works because people are made to comply!  That's the kind of functional, kind, comfortable society we could have if we forced people like Patty to stop being lazy and take a little time to do things to help everyone.  \n\nAnyway, you have nothing to feel bad about.  Your solution was kind and funny.  Patty is being a jerk.  Make sure not to lose your password to your account here because you guys could actually get into trouble if your trash isn't sorted and these posts will prove that you're not the problem.\n\nJust want to add that my college experiences were a lot like yours.  It was so hard to hold down jobs and also do well enough in class to be accepted for scholarships and foreign exchanges.  But when I realized that so many of the kids who didn't have to work (because their parents paid for everything) could hardly function in the world, I suddenly felt a lot better about having to work so much.\n\nI'm glad that someone as thoughtful and resilient and functional as you are has this opportunity.  Don't let people like Patty make you feel like you're doing something wrong because you're not.  Good luck.", "So, she'll take nothing from the experience other than thanking that Europeans are crusty-trash-sorters and you're having the time of your life and be exposed to new things....", "Thankfully, everyone in the kollegium (dorm apartment thing) is responsible for taking their trash and recycling to the hut just behind the building, where the garbage people come to get it.  They won\u2019t be able to trace where badly-sorted stuff comes from, and from what I\u2019ve seen when I open the bins to toss our stuff, there are Americans in the program who are FAR worse than Patty.\n\nAnd your words mean a lot, thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Pretty much.  She seems to be treating this as a vacation with some schoolwork while I\u2019m actively immersing myself in a new country and culture (which I like better than America).  I don\u2019t think she\u2019s even talking to the other Americans that don\u2019t go to her school, but I could be wrong - she doesn\u2019t really talk to me.", "I'd mention it when you return from the exchange.  That kind of thing can seem very disrespectful.  If your program is competitive, it seems unfair to exclude people who know how to behave in a foreign country and send people like Patty.", "You have an unfortunate roommate.\n\nGet out, explore, take an intro to Danish, see as much of the country (and its neighbors) as you can, learn loads, challenge yourself AND HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.", "Don't forget to take the train across the \u00d8resund Bridge into Malm\u00f6 Sweden at times.. So you get to explore Southern Sweden and you've 2 Countries explored.. \ud83d\ude42", "I can mention it to the program leaders on Monday (we\u2019re studying with DIS Scandinavia).  It\u2019s really competitive because of sheer numbers - people from across the USA apply.  I applied within days of the application opening and got great financial aid because of the earliness - if I\u2019d delayed, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to get the funding I needed, since they\u2019re more generous early on.\n\nAnd to be honest, I think the program has too many rich Americans in it to do much about the disrespect.  There\u2019s already been several noise complaints from the local Danish residents at my kollegium about Americans screaming in the middle of the night and jumping around on the roof terrace.  Most young Americans are inconsiderate assholes - not much you can do about it unless you really crack down or regulate.", "Yes, it can be so destructive to let that kind of dynamic continue.  People form their opinions of foreigners based on the ones they meet, so the very best people should be on that program.  I have also run into situations where the behavior of the people privileged enough to be on a program probably damaged opinions."]}
