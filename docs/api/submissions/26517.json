We\u2019ve been here about three weeks now and she won\u2019t properly sort her trash and recycling.\n\nThe system is very clear and was explained twice during orientation.  For some reason, Patty refuses to do it; she just throws everything into one bag despite me having separate, clearly-labeled bags and trash cans.  At the start of week 2, I gently prompted her to sort her trash better, and she said she was confused, so I explained the system again.  It\u2019s the end of week 3 and the final straw was today:  I saw Patty\u2019s plastic strawberry container crammed in the half-full cardboard bin, instead of the plastic bin, which was also half-full and right next to it.  I again mentioned that plastic goes with plastic, and she again said she got confused, and I explained it again.\n\nI know Patty is smart.  Patty, like me, goes to a reputable college and needed great grades to study abroad in the first place.  I checked out her LinkedIn when we first assigned as roommates and saw that she\u2019s an HSF Scholar, is majoring in psychology with a concentration in community engagement and social change, and has been an HCOP social work student and an editorial translation intern for the Institute for Solution-Focused Therapy.  I know she\u2019s capable of understanding recycling - she\u2019s just not doing it.  Which is very contradictory considering her area of study. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole.  After she said the two half-full bins confused her after four total explanations, I decided to recycle the old labels and make up cute new ones that\u2019ll simplify things as much as possible.  For example, \u201cPLASTICS\u201d is now \u201cPLASTICS:  juice & milk cartons, packaging, etc.\u201d and \u201cI might need a quick sink shower before you recycle me!\u201d with a lil drawing of a sponge and towel.  When Patty came home and saw the labels, she got mad and told me I was an asshole for patronizing her and treating her like a child.  I told her I was just being a helpful roommate, since recycling confused her so much.  I personally consider myself quite clever and fair for this one:  she\u2018s pretending to be incompetent, so I\u2019m going to treat her like she is.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for helping my confused roommate?", "created_utc": 1694263584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e4vwp/aita_for_helping_my_confused_roommate/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is not \"confused.\"  She's lazy.  Bet her parents have always done everything for her.  \n\nRules about trash are very strict in most western European countries.  Garbage companies often don't collect trash if it is not sorted correctly and that means someone else (whose life is probably much less privileged than Patty's) has to do it.  And I bet I know what that person will be telling the bosses at the university about what it's like to deal with students from your country.\n\nAlso, cleaners aren't treated like dirt in most western European countries.  If they complain about the situation with your room's trash, they will probably be listened to.  You shouldn't have to sort it either.  Patty needs to get it together.\n\nPatty owes YOU an apology.  You were a lot more patient than I would have been.  You're roommates and when she does something lazy and obnoxious with the trash, it reflects on both of you.", "NTA at all!! How can she not tell that a plastic container goes in the bin with the other plastic stuff? How stupid and ignorant does she want to be?", "NTA. I live in Denmark, and the recycling rules are not hard to understand. The new recycling system even came with stickers with examples of what goes where. You've been very patient with her, and the new stickers actually sound pretty cute. It sounds like she's choosing to be lazy and difficult \u2013 if not just difficult. I would semi-understand if she didn't know where to put something and then threw it in the bin for the things that won't be recycled, but throwing out a plastic container in the cardboard bin? Does she not like you?", "NTA, sounds like the best way to handle it, probably just too lazy. \n\nMy grandma's boyfriend actually took pictures of what goes with what (my grandma was an awesome person with a heart of gold, but genuinely didn't understand recycling). He had scolded her so many times and got tired of it, so he made pictures and put them on the bins. We all thought it was condescending, but my grandma actually started doing it right and they never fought about it again. I miss both of them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had roommates who refused to load the dishwasher properly and argued that it didn't matter as it all got clean anyway and they didn't have to do it \"my way.\" (This despite the fact it was my apartment and my diswasher, and they had never owned one.)  OK well your cups are flipping over and filling with water and you are loading stuff in a way that blocks the spray arm, so some stuff is not actually getting clean....  Finally I dug out the owner's manual, opened it to the loading instructions, and placed it on the counter above the dishwasher, with a note that said \"It's not MY way, it's THE way.\"  Fortunately for me, they didn't get offended, and started loading it properly.", "NTA \n\nShe wants to claim incompetence, this is a thoughtful solution.", "YTA.

They even have to buy special bags for some of the trash...", "You\u2019re so right about her parents doing everything for her.

My dad is the one who pays!\u201d and then Patty said, \u201cYeah, and which numbers go where?\u201d.
