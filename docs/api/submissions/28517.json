Most programs will try to book your next, convenient connection. Override that to give yourself plenty of time. Also, if you can, book direct or nonstop flights.\n\nKnow your passenger rights and if/when the airlines is required to provide overnight accommodations or get you on the next flight to your destination even if it's on a different carrier. And if they put you through two connections instead of your one originally books... make sure they give you two boarding passes (though that was a long time ago and I'm sure there are different procedures now).\n\nAnd, if your connection is incredibly tight... evaluate if you can or cannot make it and if you cannot, then be first in line to change it.\n\nAlways, be polite and kind, even to yourself.", "Oh, I've flown.

Carriers like to schedule as close to the minimum as possible and its not like the gate crew can just put in slack to hold some planes while they de-board everyone. Its that ol profit motive thing.
