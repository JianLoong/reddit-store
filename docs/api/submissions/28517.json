It sucks they didn\u2019t make an announcement for you but I really wish we could clear up this misconception that there\u2019s some number we have for say, gate 34 at a random airport to hold your plane.

How about you not getting your panties in a wad. \n\nIt is a proven fact that waiting to deplane by rows is one of the most inefficient ways to deplane and no one apart from some people in the US actually cares about it or actually deplanes row by row. It's just adding and lengthening the off-boarding process.", "But how big of a delay?  \n\nIf it\u2019s a major delay like 50% of that plane is trying to get off in a hurry. He is not more important than those other people. \n\nIf it\u2019s just a slight delay and his initial connection was kinda tight, so most people are still fine, this is way less of an asshole move IMO.", "Those classy folks were definitely from Chicago and \u201cMidwest Nice\u201d doesn\u2019t fuck around.

We\u2019ve got some tight connections!\u201d I swear to you I have zero expectation that that gate agent is going to take that information and do anything with it. They\u2019ve got flight closing duties.
