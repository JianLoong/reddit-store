We are both in our early 40\u2019s with my sister and her husband they are in late 30\u2019s whom live with my parents (both near 70 y/o) along with their 5 year old daughter. \n\nMy BIL has been unemployed since before Christmas and has no motivation to look for a job since my parents let them live with them rent free and they virtually have no bills except car insurance, everything else is paid by my parents.  \n\nMy BIL took a seasonal job at Target, knowing that it was going to be temporary so when the time came up for it to end he expressed that he did not want to work. My sister does not work, and has not since before her daughter was born. \n\nMy parents would complain about how they both need to be working but not forcing them to look for a job. My BIL since December has put in 3 applications and blamed that he was having vehicle issues to go out and look for jobs so my husband on his way home from work would send in the family group, places that he thought would be good fit for BIL, it came from a place of sincerely trying to help. My husband sent 5 different jobs in a week, so not too much to be obnoxious but to give him an idea of different places that maybe he could apply to online from home.\n\nSo my 12 y/o son spent the night over with them to spend time with my dad and there was never a mention of anything being rude or offensive. My BIL came over and was talking to my husband like normal, as we left BIL gave husband a hug. \n\nFast forward a few days then I get a phone call from my after I got off work, I answered it and he was telling me that he needed to speak to me and my husband in person because of something my niece said to him\u2026 naturally I\u2019m curious what it could be about so I agree for him to come up that night.\n\nIt ends up being that my niece allegedly told my dad that my husband was being mean to her mommy. So my dad asks my sister what she is talking about? My sister informs our dad that when my husband would send the job suggestions it would cause an argument between her and my BIL. \n\nNone of us were aware of any of this. \n\nMy parents for context have enabled my sister her entire life and they walk on egg shells with her because of her \u201dfly off the handle\u201d personality. \n\nMy dad arrived with an agenda that night to scream at my husband for simply trying to help. Now my son feels like he is caught in the middle because he was enjoying time with my dad, however he sees him differently since this took place.\n\nI have told my son numerous times that if he wants to speak too or spend time with my dad, he is welcome too. I am not a hurry to kiss and make up with my family. \n\nMy family deleted my husband from Facebook and I am just trying to make sense of what we did wrong.

It appears that any mention of that to your parents is of little use at this point.  Your parents should prepare themselves for your sister and your BIL to be their roommates for a long time.  You may be able to revisit a conversation with your parents about (especially) the BIL taking advantage of the situation, but that will likely need to be at least 6 months in the future.  Maybe by that time their eyes will be open to his laziness.", "NTA\n\nYour folks will continue to walk on eggshells and be servants to these freeloaders. I'm sorry you've lost your family over this. But when they choose favourites like this, it's easy to go no/low contact.\n\nLock up that moolah of yours and make sure your wills and life insurance beneficiaries are watertight. They'll be mooching off you when their current well dries up.", "For what it is worth, the only reason any jobs were sent to BIL is because he claimed vehicle issues as to why he was unable to look for a job. Also, I should note that the 5 y/o is my sister and BIL daughter. Both of my parents have serious health issues and have unfortunately had to primarily raise the granddaughter because my sister & BIL would rather be stoned all day instead of spending time with their daughter. My sister threatened my BIL that she would divorce him if he did not \u201cman up\u201d so it was not that we were meddling in anyone else\u2019s business, it was more that we were genuinely trying to help because I am concerned for my niece and the toxic environment she lives in.", "NTA. You can't help those that don't want it. You insulted them by sending job offers to confirmed freeloaders. Remember that in the future when they ask for help. Too bad your dad is taking sides. Work is contrary to my religion I'm a confirmed Loafer.", "NTA. Your family is toxic. Sister has your parents wrapped around her finger. Just tune out the noise and help your son as well.

Don\u2019t let him near your dad. Are you kidding me? Do you actually think they aren\u2019t talking crap about your husband to your kid. Wake up and stop enabling your parents.", "Very slight YTA.\n\nSending 5 text messages in one week about potential jobs is a bit much, and I fear that you and your partner were meddling a bit too much in your BIL's unemployment. For everything else, I would say you are not being an AH, and I think you are handling the situation with your dad and son's relationship well.", "ESH. Sure your BIL and sister are being freeloaders so they're not great. But that's your parents' problem, and nothing you've said indicates your parents are unable to speak for themselves. But you and your husband are sticking your noses in and sending unsolicited \"help\" which, based on your tone here, I very much assume comes off as patronizing. It's one thing to suggest a job that you have a connection to or know is a big opening, it's different to just randomly send suggestions that various places are hiring. Everybody here is an adult, let them handle themselves.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you and your husband feel the need to butt in? Sending job suggestions is an AH move, they can find those themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy couldn't you just stay out, this is NOT YOUR drama.", "It looks like YTA only because you upset the status quo. To everyone else in the world you aren't, but to their little codependent world you are. This is the time to brush off your hands and walk away clean. With your aging unhealthy parents you are going to soon find yourselves in your parent's role. Just walk away. You need to build up distance from those freeloaders or sibling guilt is going to grab you hard and turn you into something you don't want to be. Trust me my older sister and younger sister are now in this kind of dynamic after passing of my parents. Everyone in that house is an adult and as long as the 5yo is being cared for just stay clear.\nOf course your son should be free to spend as much time as he wants with grandpa, do everything you can to help with that. Just don't engage about anything else not involving your kid.", "It seems to me like everything you have said here is true. BIL is taking advantage of the parents. However, I am not sure it is really OP's place to meddle in her parents' and in-law's affairs. I think if OP is an AH, it is very, very mild, but the BIL's lack of work ethic isn't really OP's business at the moment.", "Fuck them off. Not worth the time or trouble. Freeloaders. \n\nGood luck.\n\n\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29", "Very light - though I am sure it came from a place of wanting to help.  But I would back off on that.\n\nAgree with the comment about locking up your money, etc.", "NTA Time for you, hubby and kids to go radio silent. In 6 months your parents will be begging for your help.", "NTA\n\nI feel for you since, if nothing is being left out, I can't see the problem?  Your husband was sending the jobs to him, why was his wife getting mad?  Obviously something else is going on.", "NTA. Toxic situation. I\u2019m sure your dad will feel the consequences of the enabling. Also don\u2019t let your son go near him."]}
