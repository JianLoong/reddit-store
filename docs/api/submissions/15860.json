I (18M) had been flirting with a classmate (18F) for a few months, but I realized that I wasn't interested in pursuing anything further with her as I realized she although she is extremely attractive she is too immature for me, not to mention she has some backward word views like openly opposing lgbtq, anyways.\n\nAfter I rejected her we had an argument in school because she didn\u2019t take the rejection well and I\u2019ll admit I might have gone too far because I did insult her more than I should have, anyways that was a whole drama, this situation ended about 30 days ago or at least I originally thought so.\n\nA couple days ago one of the boys in my grade who I had been close with seemingly cut me out of his life and wouldn\u2019t tell me why, then today I found out that that the girl has started to crop screenshots of our old conversations making it seem like I was being creepy towards her and telling everyone that was she was repulsed by how I was acting and that I had harassed her, these screenshots included things like me saying \u201cI hope I can kiss you sometime\u201d and other slightly more inappropriate things that out of context might seem iffy to anyone who reads them. \n\nThen One of my other friends (18F) got quite upset about this and showed me the cropped screenshots, I immediately went back and sent her huge chunks of the conversations which the screenshots going around my school had convitinetly left out, my friend asked if she could send them in the girls group chat and I said ok.\n\nThen after school today Hannah (the girl who had cropped the screenshots) called me screaming and crying, accusing me of \u201cexposing her.\u201d and saying like \u201chow dare you\u201d and whatever else, also saying that if I do it again she will quote: \u201cend me\u201d. I told her I will never mention her in any conversation I ever have with anyone in school if she doesn\u2019t do the same and called her a hypocrite.

She shared private messages from you to destroy your reputation and then gets mad when you do the same to save your reputation. And she specifically cropped it to show you in a bad light. You just showed the context.", "Wow, definitely NTA. She's clearly trying to make you look like the bad guy. I'll never understand how people will purposely take things out of context to make someone look bad, then when the other person shows the rest of the conversation, cries about being eXpOsEd. Jfc, girl you started it! She could've just taken the rejection and moved on", "NTA and whatever you do, save those texts.  The girls sounds like the type who would try to get you in trouble.", "NTA. Girl doesn\u2019t need to be trying to embarrass you if she doesn\u2019t want to get called out.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nShe made false representations about you and you corrected the record. You are absolutely entitled to do this and it is important that you did, because what she was doing could have had serious consequences for you. I am very glad you stood up for yourself. Never feel bad about correcting a false representation or accusation, especially when someone is deliberately misrepresenting things to make you look bad for their own purposes. \n\nHer behaviour is very attention-seeking and manipulative.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nShe fucked around and found out. I would normally have issue with publicly sharing private conversations without permission BUT she did it first and you were simply setting the record straight. You didn\u2019t do it out of malice or to make her look bad, you were defending yourself.", "NTA but id have a word with your schools counsellor or a teacher. if she's doing this and has threatened to \"end you\" it will be in your interest to get ahead of it.\n\nif she did try another stunt and she/someone decided to let a member of staff know at least they are aware that she previously has presented information in a light that isn't giving the full context/circumstances.\n\nYou may not be the only person she has done this to so defo speak to someone at school and take the messages she sent and the full conversation as evidence. depending on their policies it could potentially be classed as bullying/harassment as it's impacted you socially and you don't know if she's been giving the story outside of school too.\n\nEDIT: I am preempting a comment replying to this calling speaking to someone in the administration \"Snitching\". Speaking up can be the difference between a stalking charge and your integrity/freedom (extreme but the way the texts are cropped could give the \"impression\" alongside her doubling down that YOU were continuing advances AFTER she \"rejected\" you - look how your friends reacted when they took the messages at face value). I'd call this 'her finding out the consequences of her fuckabout '.\n\nRemember it takes years to build a reputation but a second for that to be kyboshed into the netherworld and never be rebuilt unless you move across the country if not out of it.", "NTA. You we\u2019re having a private convo via text. Cropping the texts and sharing them with your schoolmates is slander.", "NTA - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Keep us updated if she does anything in the future, i dont think its over", "NTA, she intentionally changed texts to make you look bad and ruin your reputation along with sending them to everyone. You did the only thing you could do!", "NTA. A classic fuck around and find out.", "NTA, but I question your confidence she won't try to get you in trouble at school....\n\nYou got a very brief look into what she's willing to do when you made her upset, don't you think she's even more pissed now? \n\nI'd be asking your 18F friend for some proof that you told the whole story, and honestly you should at least consider going to the school administration over this. She was more than happy to paint you as a creepy fuck and cost you friendships, you need to protect yourself. \n\nIt's not about consequences for her, it's about making sure she doesn't escalate and make this even worse for you.", "NTA.\n\nTell her your not afraid to get police involved not only for harassment, but also for defamation.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t know because you glossed over the \u201cI might have gone too far\u2026\u201d You didn\u2019t need to insult her. So. I\u2019m thinking YTA. She was also defending herself.", "ESH. Her for manipulating the texts, & you for needlessly insulting her.", "ESH. For you, if you feel you went too far in your argument after she refused to accept your \u201cbreakup\u201d (I know you didn\u2019t even have a relationship to break up from, but for ease of communication let\u2019s just call it that) then you likely did and that is what makes you a AH, albeit only a slight AH. Her attempt to cause you harm via those cropped texts makes her a much bigger AH and is far more serious. Her attempt to paint you as a type of predator could affect your college prospects, as well as any scholarships you may be able to receive. It could even get you into legal trouble, which you would likely be able to clear yourself from but could also affect you for years to come if colleges or employers learn about it. If any of your friends see any messages from her about you, get them to take screenshots and save them. These could be the one thing that saves you from a huge amount of legal issues. Lastly, while I hate even thinking this way, given her threat to \u201cend you\u201d and the way things seem to be going especially in the younger crowd you should probably view that threat much more seriously than you would want to. The last thing you want or need is for her to prove to be one of those people that appear meek and wouldn\u2019t even consider harm but in actuality will go and cause that harm or even death. You may want to escalate that threat up the chain to the administration. It might be overkill, but better to go overboard with the reaction than to ignore it and you or others wind up hurt or dead.", ">After I rejected her we had an argument in school because she didn\u2019t take the rejection well and I\u2019ll admit I might have gone too far because I did insult her more than I should have\n\nESH. These nubs saying you're N A are living a parody. You and the girl both suck. And it's lovely when two A Hs bite each other's throats lmao", "ESH and both of you sound too immature for any kind of a relationship at this point. You decided she wasn\u2019t who you wanted to date so you publicly insulted her and then she retaliated with cropped conversations. Use your time in college to outgrow this behavior and maybe try again in your mid twenties.", "ESH. What she did was messed up and could have even landed you in trouble with the school. She's the reason women often aren't believed when they report harassment, sadly. \n\nBut why did you need to \"insult\" her at all when you rejected her? I mean from what you said, you'd just be flirting with her for months, but not dating, so you hadn't even asked her out yet? So it was just flirting, there's no need to give an insulting rejection. You should have just told her you weren't feeling it and wanted to just be friends, then you could have done a slow fade from there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
