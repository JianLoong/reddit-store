She has two kids (12f, 15f) with shared custody. It\u2019s an odd arrangement, she has them Jan-June. Early September, she moved into our house. My daughter \u2018Charlie\u2019 is 10. For the record, up until recently she has been an amazing mother figure to Charlie. \n\nOur first issue was back in November as we discussed bedroom arrangements. She felt her eldest should have a room of her own while living here 6 months out of the year. That would cause Charlie to bunk with her youngest. I however did not allow it because that would encroach Charlie and likely cause her to feel alienated in her own home. \n\nLast weekend I was called in and worked a 12hr shift. When I arrived home, Charlie was upset because they went out to eat and left her home. She said when they came back, she was handed a bag of takeout and the food was stone cold. I asked my fianc\u00e9e to elaborate, to which she confirmed taking only her girls out to an early dinner then took them to play mini golf. Hence why the food was cold, it sat in the car as they played. \n\nShe kept deflecting to the food, saying she didn\u2019t expect her to eat it cold, she could have warned it up herself. I kept insisting it was extremely rude to exclude Charlie from the outing. She came back with\u2026\u201dBut I brought her food home.\u201d She then asked, \u201cWhy is it ok for you to go out with just Charlie?\u201d That\u2019s different, in the last 30 days her kids have been here, Charlie and I have only gone grocery shopping or on one occasion took her cat to the vet. That can\u2019t even be compared to what she did.\n\nWe didn\u2019t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t offend Charlie too.\u201d It pissed me off she said that, I called her feral. We both later apologized, but she then started the argument back up. She said it was so rude of me to argue about her taking her kids out. She further said, \u201cI don\u2019t see my kids for 6 months, excuse the hell out of me for wanting to spend time alone with them.\u201d \n\nI understood her point, but I felt like we could periodically plan separate outings on the same day so no one feels excluded. She kinda threw the bedroom ordeal in my face and said, \u201cMy kids might feel alienated from their own mother if they can\u2019t enjoy time alone with me.\u201d She made the pointless remark that her kids have no problem with her doing things with Charlie while they\u2019re living with their father. She further argued that there will be many times when Charlie will be excluded because of the age gap between her and the eldest. \n\nI told her if she expects things to workout, she would need to treat Charlie as one of her daughters. She said I was entirely missing her point because I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like having shared custody. Me scolding her for spending time with them as she said was a \u2018bitch-ass\u2019 move.", "created_utc": 1675698546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v9vrx/aita_for_arguing_with_my_fianc\u00e9e_after_she_left/", "score": 5239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your fianc\u00e9 sounds very immature, and it sounds like you both need to work on your communication.\nYou\u2019re NTA but your fianc\u00e9 is for leaving a 10 year old home alone for that long and specifically excluding her from the outing.\ud83d\udea9", "NTA the way she went about this was terrible and hurtful to Charlie. She isn't wrong about making time for the children to hangout with their biological parent alone, but it should've been planned after a conversation. \n\nAlso it's crazy she thought her kid deserved their own room when they're not even there half the year.", "INFO: Who watched Charlie all day if you were working for 12hs and your fiance\u00e9 spent the day out with her daughters? \n\nI think you're NTA either way and your fiance\u00e9 is the the asshole. But if she left a 10 year old home alone all day while she and her daughters had a fun outing then she's not only an asshole but a neglecting step-parent. And your relationship issues are much bigger if that's the case. \n\nRegardless, your fiance\u00e9 is being manipulative. Her wanting alone time with her daughters is logical, but there are many ways in which she can get that that don't involve making Charlie feel excluded. Right now she's a full-blown evil stepmother, treating her daughters to dinner and an activity while leaving Cinderella home to pass the hours in company of singing mice. For me, this would be an absolute dealbreaker. You cannot let her treat your daughter like this. \n\nHer comparing going to the grocery store, the vet, or the dentist, to going out for dinner and mini golf is ridiculous. Unless you are going out for fun time with Charlie and excluding her daughters when they're living with you, then she has nothing against you on this. Errands and appointments are in no way the same as going out for fun and entertainment. \n\nYour proposal is perfectly reasonable: she can plan stuff to do with just her daughters and you plan something just with Charlie on that same day. You could also all go to the same place but agree to split, with you and Charlie doing your own thing, her and her daughters doing their own thing, and then all meeting up to share something all five together. \n\nTo me it seems she is resentful of not getting the exclusive room for her eldest. She might even resent that you have full custody of your child, or feel guilty that she spends more time (technically) with your daughter than with her own. But none of this gives her any right to mistreat a 10 year old girl this way. \n\nI'm sorry, but you should really think about marrying this woman.", "NTA.\n\nFrom this small snippet into your lives, it sounds like your fianc\u00e9e might be bullying your daughter (exclusion is a form of bullying).\n\nI think you need to sit down with Charlie and find out if anything else has been happening when she has been left alone with your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nLook, I understand your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s point of wanting to spend qt with her daughters, but it shouldn\u2019t be done at the expense of yours. She could have easily picked another day, where you were at home, to get that time in.  \n\nIt sounds like she is still upset about the bedroom situation and is using that as an excuse for her bad behaviour.\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA and you need to leave her ass", "NTA you\u2019re still with this woman why?

She could of picked up food at the very least after her mini golf adventure.", "NTA but you shouldn't ignore your fiancee red flags.... she sounds like she'd definitely pull the \"it's me or your daughter\" card.", "You have bigger issues than you seem to realize. This person is not going to be a good parental figure for your daughter and likely not a good partner to you. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for her to want quality time with her kids, but she\u2019s going about it in a terribly immature and mean way. \n\nYour compromise of prearranging separate trips on certain days was an excellent one, the fact that she rejected it so vehemently suggests there\u2019s something more to it than you are aware of. \n\nIf she really can\u2019t understand why the things she\u2019s saying and doing are messed up, you need to think deeply on if this is the kind of person you really want to share your life with. Do you really want to be with someone who sees nothing wrong with treating your daughter so callously?\n\nNTA, but this issue is bigger than Reddit. Good luck with resolving this as peacefully as possible.", "NTA for this situation, although I do think you and your fiancee really need to spend some time discussing things with regards to the kids, because whatever is happening is not working. It seems like some resentment is building and, if neither of you deal with that NOW (on both your ends), it's just going to fester until something happens. \n\nI think your fiancee has handled the situation poorly. She should not have left your daughter home alone for hours. It seems like she's bitter over the initial living arrangements. Maybe that influenced her to leave your daughter home, maybe not. She's not wrong in wanting to spend time with her kids, but she is wrong for neglecting your own daughter by leaving her alone. That is not ok and she needs to understand that taking her issues out on Charlie is not acceptable. If she wanted to spend time with her girls, she needed to find arrangements for Charlie first.\n\nI do think she has a point about her eldest needing her own room. 15 is an age that she probably doesn't want to share with siblings. Even if her daughters aren't with her all the time, it is still their home. Even if Charlie is there all the time, it doesn't mean she gets top priority every time. So you two really need to sit down and discuss this because there are so many issues just waiting to be brought up and you need to work that out BEFORE marriage.", "NTA. And this doesn't appear to be working out.", "NTA. \n\nIf this continues, Charlie will start to resent YOU for not protecting her and not standing up for her. (Rightfully so.) Your girlfriend sounds cruel. \n\nI would seriously reconsider building a life/family with this woman. Poor Charlie.", "NTA. There's a big difference between taking a kid to an appointment and taking them out for food and fun. When she's ditching Charlie in favor of her own daughters - that's very hurtful and damaging to Charlie. It's kinda the scene with the stepmom in Cinderella taking her own daughters to the ball and leaving the Cinderella behind.  Your fiance is totally looking out for just herself and her own daughters whenever she has them, and putting Charlie on a shelf. Once her daughters are gone, then she takes Charlie off the shelf and treats her nicer, simply because Charlie's there - not because she's interested in Charlie's well-being. I think she is showing you her true self when she has custody of her daughters.", "NTA, but for Charlie's sake, please don't marry this woman. She is going to be around your daughter 24/7, 365 days a year, but for half that time, your daughter is going to be ignored by her in favour of her biological children. Please put Charlie first.", "NTA\n\nYour fiancee leaving a 10yo alone like that is a red flag\n\nI get that she wants to spend time with just her bio kids and she should be able to, but it needs to be planned better. Your compromise to coordinate seems like a great idea. Or she could go out with her kids while Charlie is at a friend's house or with other family\n\nBut before focusing on finding a compromise I'd seriously think about whether you really want to marry a woman who left your young child alone for selfish and kind of petty reasons. Her kids will be there for a couple more months after all, it's not like this was her only opportunity to spend time with them", "NTA.\n\nYour fiancee did that on purpose to spite you for the room situation. She is pissed she didn't get her way, and she is gonna make Charlie pay for it. \n\n> We didn\u2019t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t offend Charlie too.\u201d \n\nThis makes me concerned for Charlie and kinda backs up my first point. She doesn't even acknowledge she did anything wrong, and thinks you taking issue with it is a result of Charlie being upset - as if you would've been OK with Charlie being left alone all day and eating cold food if she hadn't complained. \n\nShe has her kids 6 months out of the year, so I am sure there are plenty of other opportunities for her to have one-on-one time with them. The way she is treating Charlie isn't right, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is more stuff that just hasn't been brought to your attention. \n\nI wouldn't marry someone who is OK treating my 10 year old kid like that.", "NTA but girlfriend needs to go.  Protect your daughter.", "NTA.She for leaving a ten year old home alone. Plus serving her cold food that sat in the car.

Leaving Charlie home alone all day and then picking up takeout but leaving it to sit in the car for however long and bringing it home cold is just thoughtless. It probably made Charlie feel like a second thought. And it's totally unfair of your wife to throw your one on one trips in your face when they were... grocery shopping and taking a pet to the vet. Not exactly fun parent-child outings. \n\nThe two of you will just have to plan things ahead and coordinate schedules going forward. If she really can't see why you were miffed that she left the 10 year old home alone and then brought her old cold food, that's pretty crappy.", "NTA. Charlie was disrespected in her own house.

Your number one priority is Charlie and if she is being neglected you need handle this immediately. You can not continue to leave her with your fiance. Id rethink this marriage.", "NTA.\n\nAs far as the bedroom thing, I don't think there's a right or wrong answer - while traditionally the oldest gets their own room, this isn't a traditional situation. But that's really a side issue here.\n\nLeaving a ten year old home alone while she goes for dinner/mini golf is completely unacceptable. That's \"evil stepmother\" territory. Yes, she wants and deserves time alone with her two bio kids, but that needs to be coordinated in advance (you don't just leave the youngest one at home alone, you make sure she has her own thing to do, preferably with her parent). \n\nWhile I realize this isn't a constant thing, I wonder if this is a good environment for your daughter. Is she going to be cut out and made to feel like this for six months a year, then when the stepsisters are gone be back to normal person status? That's not acceptable, please don't make her live that. If you think this kind of situation may happen again, you might need to take drastic measures.", "NTA. There\u2019s one on one time and then there\u2019s excluding someone. You are saying in the future that if they are going out just the 3 of them, plan with you ahead of time so Charlie has her own thing to do. You aren\u2019t trying to force them to bring her, just asking for consideration. This isn\u2019t older siblings going out with their friends on their own and half the year isn\u2019t a special occasion, it\u2019s who is supposed to be her family.

I do think it's worth discussing the room again, potentially with Charlie.

She has two kids (12f, 15f) with shared custody. It\u2019s an odd arrangement, she has them Jan-June. Early September, she moved into our house. My daughter \u2018Charlie\u2019 is 10. For the record, up until recently she has been an amazing mother figure to Charlie. \n\nOur first issue was back in November as we discussed bedroom arrangements. She felt her eldest should have a room of her own while living here 6 months out of the year. That would cause Charlie to bunk with her youngest. I however did not allow it because that would encroach Charlie and likely cause her to feel alienated in her own home. \n\nLast weekend I was called in and worked a 12hr shift. When I arrived home, Charlie was upset because they went out to eat and left her home. She said when they came back, she was handed a bag of takeout and the food was stone cold. I asked my fianc\u00e9e to elaborate, to which she confirmed taking only her girls out to an early dinner then took them to play mini golf. Hence why the food was cold, it sat in the car as they played. \n\nShe kept deflecting to the food, saying she didn\u2019t expect her to eat it cold, she could have warned it up herself. I kept insisting it was extremely rude to exclude Charlie from the outing. She came back with\u2026\u201dBut I brought her food home.\u201d She then asked, \u201cWhy is it ok for you to go out with just Charlie?\u201d That\u2019s different, in the last 30 days her kids have been here, Charlie and I have only gone grocery shopping or on one occasion took her cat to the vet. That can\u2019t even be compared to what she did.\n\nWe didn\u2019t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t offend Charlie too.\u201d It pissed me off she said that, I called her feral. We both later apologized, but she then started the argument back up. She said it was so rude of me to argue about her taking her kids out. She further said, \u201cI don\u2019t see my kids for 6 months, excuse the hell out of me for wanting to spend time alone with them.\u201d \n\nI understood her point, but I felt like we could periodically plan separate outings on the same day so no one feels excluded. She kinda threw the bedroom ordeal in my face and said, \u201cMy kids might feel alienated from their own mother if they can\u2019t enjoy time alone with me.\u201d She made the pointless remark that her kids have no problem with her doing things with Charlie while they\u2019re living with their father. She further argued that there will be many times when Charlie will be excluded because of the age gap between her and the eldest. \n\nI told her if she expects things to workout, she would need to treat Charlie as one of her daughters. She said I was entirely missing her point because I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like having shared custody. Me scolding her for spending time with them as she said was a \u2018bitch-ass\u2019 move.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can't imagine being forced to share a bedroom with a stepsibling I barely know.

(I gotta say this situation sounds terrible for your fiance's children though.)\n* Dunno how you're handling co-parenting, but yeah, I'd expect your fiance to understand that her being alone with the three kids means she takes care of all of them, and bringing home cold leftovers for Charlie is really half-assing feeding her at best.\n* She should be able to spend time alone with her kids and not Charlie. That time should be when *you* are there to watch Charlie or when it's been worked out ahead of time (if Charlie's being left alone for an age-appropriate amount of time and it's not sprung on her out of nowhere.) It is also likely to make Charlie feel left out when they do fun things without her, so as much as possible you should arrange your lives so that your father/daughter time with Charlie happens at the same time as her mother/daughter bonding time with her kids. Or whichever kid/kids are being left out have their own thing going on that they're really happy about.\n* You absolutely should spend 1:1 time with Charlie doing fun things, and not only do errands and other necessary/unfun things with her while the step-sibs are around. It's not actually good of you to not have fun time with your kid without making it a forced happy family situation. I didn't even *have* a blended family and I still deeply valued time with one parent or the other that I didn't have to share with my brother. Kids don't want to always be around their siblings, or step-siblings. If your fiance's behavior was truly an abberation and not her showing her true colors, Charlie will probably *also* want some time just her and her step-mom now and then.\n* But also, damn, not-the-whole-family parent-child bonding time can happen on weekend afternoons or whatever, over dinner is just *bad*, being fed is a really primal need.", "NTA - WTF.

One, she had to choose such a bizarre arrangement for co-parenting.  No judge is going to just hand that down out of the blue.  She has no room to complain about what she chose.  Second, and way more importantly, did she leave your 10 year old home alone without any supervision and without even telling you?  That is beyond the pale.  I would be breaking up immediately over something like this, particularly because of the callousness of it.  She clearly has no interest in being a blended family.

No one even told Charlie anything except we\u2019ll bring dinner home. She didn\u2019t know about them playing mini golf until I wanted to know what exactly the reason was for her being left home.

It's the leaving a 10 yr old home, and excluding them that bothers me. And acting like its the same as not taking them to the vet or freaking grocery shopping (which I suspect the other kids \\*didn't want to do\\*!!). It's one thing to say 'hey, we have to do this, do you want to come' and for some kids to say 'no thanks, we'll stay home'.

But...even though we\u2019ve been together for 4 years and our kids mingle together, they\u2019ve never lived together until now. I think the first go around the two siblings should share a room. Maybe by next year Charlie would feel comfortable bunking with her youngest. I think it would be too much, too soon for Charlie. Like hey they\u2019re moving in now and you\u2019re getting bumped out of your room you\u2019ve had since you were born. That wouldn\u2019t be ok.", "I agree. It completely blindsided me.

Of course I\u2019m having second thoughts. I wasn\u2019t really when the bedroom incident happened. I was taken aback by it.

Luckily, we don\u2019t have a date set. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we nowhere near that.", "Yes, this has only been an issue since she moved in. I should have elaborated more how the dynamic changed. I get a lot of comments here are saying toss her to the curb. That\u2019s why I said to her if you expect this to workout. \n\nBefore we lived together, she would take her kids to amusement parks, water parks, bowling alleys. You know, all that type of stuff. Sometimes both Charlie and I would join, sometimes we\u2019d later hear about the things they did together. That was fine, no one was excluded because the dynamic was different. Two different households. \n\nThen during the 6 months she didn\u2019t have the kids, we\u2019d see each other more. We\u2019d take Charlie together to go do fun things. Sometimes we\u2019d have date nights while Charlie was spending time with her grandmother. Everything was fine. Charlie\u2019s mom left the picture when she was 3. She doesn\u2019t ever see her. So having a mother figure, aside from her grandma really helped Charlie to fill a void.", "Speaking as an oldest child myself, being the oldest isn't something that should be the guarantee for having your own room so much as what the needs of the children involved are.

By her logic, you can kick her to the curb and you have no obligation to cater to her daughters either, her mistreatment will just get worse as she's shown to her daughters to do the same.\n\n As stated above, she does sound resentful to you for not kicking your own daughter out of her bedroom just so her eldest (who is only with her for 6 months) can have her own room, your house, your rules so unless she's footing half of your mortgage, she can't just come in and rearrange both you and your daughter's home to suit her own daughters. \n\nYour NTA, but your daughter deserves better, Your fianc\u00e9e is immature, selfish and entitled, just picture yourself in the next few months if this is the kind of dysfunction you want to come home to.", "I'm with you on that.", "What explanation did your fianc\u00e9e give for making plans outside the home without giving you notice so you could arrange safe care for your daughter?\n\nI'm not saying there's *any* valid reason.

If she wants to spend alone time with her kids that is great but she has to coordinate it with you. Let her know it would be a great opportunity for you to spend 1 on 1 with Charlie also. If she ever does anything like this again tell her she will have to move out. I understand everything is so expensive and I think you need to give her a set time. Even if you tell her you will let her and her kids stay there till they go back with their father and then she has 30 days to vacate your house.

It wouldn't make sense to displace Charlie under those circumstances.\n\nAlso, it is notable that the incident with the outing and food happened so soon after she moved in and her daughters came to stay with her.  There is no question, how she treated your daughter was abysmal.  Leaving a 10 year-old alone and hungry at night is neglectful and abusive.  As you explained, at no point had Charlie been left home alone like this (and hungry to boot).  Further, you've been with your Fiance long enough for her to KNOW better.   \n\nThat your finance is trying to deflect and excuse her behavior are huge red flags.  Don't expect her treatment of your daughter to get any better.

So in addition to living with a woman who fucks off with her own bio kids when she\u2019s supposed to be watching Charlie, Charlie is also living in a situation in which an authority figure gaslights her when she\u2019s upset. So she\u2019ll grow up and get into friendships and relationships where she\u2019ll be mistreated, and she won\u2019t even know she\u2019s being mistreated! Because your fianc\u00e9 is training her to be ashamed of feeing mistreated when she truly has been mistreated.", "How much furniture does a 12 year old come with? I fail to see a big deal with half the room being unused half the year. It is an interesting point though about SS always feeling like it\u2019s Charlie\u2019s room. That\u2019s a valid concern.", "And if you also consider the fact that the fianc\u00e9e obviously thought that there wasn't an age gap problem with her younger daughter sharing a room with Charlie, it shows she's massively hypocritical.", "Geez Louise \ud83d\ude44 I was babysitting my infant brother at 11 and all that entailed. I fed him, changed him and put him down for naps or for the night. If need be I bathed him. I kept us alive and didn\u2019t burn the house down. \ud83d\ude44", "4 hours is the Food Safety guideline anything beyond that must be thrown away.  That means hot food must be hot for 4 hours to be safe to eat and cold food is the same.  Reheating good that is past the safety time is highly skeptical and could cause problems", "Why didn't she just leave the poor kid at her grandma's. It would have still been kinda mean but at least the child would be with someone who loved her and not alone in a big house wondering when she's going to see anyone.", "YWB TA if she isn't immediately your ex-fiance and kicked out of your home. \n\nShe was responsible for your daughter when she was home, too. She neglected her. The food she gave her could have resulted in serious illness--food poisoning could be deadly. This would be a very different post if you were writing it from the hospital. \n\nIt sounds like she was using your daughter's health and wellbeing to get back at you for the room choice. She poses an active danger to your child and cannot be permitted to stay another night. \n\nNTA on the question you asked. But letting her stay even through the rest of the night is bad judgment on your part. She has to go.", "Dude. For your daughter's sake, PLEASE get rid of this woman.\n\nThe moment she moved in and thought she had you locked down, her demeanor towards your daughter completely changed.\n\nCharlie could have gotten food poisoning, any number of things could have happened while they were out to her. Thankfully it didn't, but she does NOT have your child's best interests at heart.\n\nShe wants her kids to take priority in your life over your daughter.\n\nDump her. *Yesterday.*", "NTA but my guy... your fianc\u00e9e has blessedly shown you her true colors before you got locked into marriage. When someone tells you who they are, believe them. Get out of this relationship for your daughter's sake.", "What your fianc\u00e9 did was cruel", "Your fianc\u00e9e expects your daughter to share a room half the year because her kids aren\u2019t there full time? Wtf? If anyone should get a solo room, it\u2019s your kid, not hers.\n\nHave your daughter\u2019s back, and take a good hard look at the woman you\u2019re engaged to, and notice clearly that she places your daughter well below her own kids. \n\nYour daughter is a second class citizen to your future wife.", "The child that lives there full time should absolutely have their own space. What, six months out of the year there should be an empty single room while charlie has to live with the other child\u2019s belongs in their space? It just doesn\u2019t make sense.", "OP's weekend shift was twelve hours. Charlie was probably alone for three hours, the time it would take to eat dinner and play mini golf.", "This. Like no, sorry, that's the end of the relationship for me. You don't bring home bacteria laden food for a 10 year old, who has no idea what's going on or how long you'll be gone.\n\nThe fact that he's choosing to stay with her knowing she did this means exactly what you said...he cares more about getting his dick wet than the kiddo.\n\nMaybe he should ask Charlie if she was ever mean to her before this? I bet anything she has been.", "My guy, one girl dad to the next if someone did this to my daughter they would never see me or her ever again.", "Next year? Dude\u2026 I see where this is going. By next year your daughter is going to be Cinderella and you\u2019ll be letting Wicked Stepmother run the show completely. \n\nGrow a backbone and do what\u2019s right for your child.", "Did your fianc\u00e9 live in a 3 bedroom apt before to provide a separate room for her eldest? If the answer is yes, she should\u2019ve thought about that before moving in. If the answer is no, then she\u2019s a manipulative abuser.", "There should be no \u201cnext year\u201d with this woman. The crap she is pulling is what one of my FIL\u2019s gfs did to my husband and his sisters when they were kids. Kids were afraid to tell him, but when they did, he RIGHTFULLY DUMPED HER ASS! Get this woman OUT of your daughter\u2019s life. She has shown you who she truly is. Believe it.", "Tough luck to abusive fianc\u00e9e and her kids, they need 30-60 day notice whatever is the legal eviction is where you live. Make sure they understand their actions/abuse are what cost them their housing and the mother\u2019s relationship.", "She moved in at September, but she only has custody January through June.   So this past month would be the first with all three girls in the house.  That\u2019s the disconnect people are having.  The other girls were not there before so this would be the first time there was a reason to exclude his daughter.", "Yes but based on my experience my kids didn\u2019t really start having a huge social life until they could drive.  Junior/senior year is a lot different than freshmen/sophomore year. I was the same way. Once I could drive I was always wanting to be with my friends.", "Perfectly said. \nAnd by them doing that, it\u2019s showing her girls they can be ugly to Charlie without consequences, because their mother got away with it.", "That's perfect lol", "Mother fucker's savage.\n\nI like it not gonna lie.", "Most states and experts give leeway of an hour or under.  It teaches responsibility and by that age assuming competent parenting and no unusual factors the kid hopefully knows better then to turn on the oven or play with the knives.", "Yup, there is no need to even think about it. You should \"rehoming\" your ex fianc\u00e9 and her kids that's coming from a stepmother.", "Forget the name of the book it came out last decade but it talked about how tribal societies raise their children. Tldr They have far more responsibilities than industrialized kids do yet far fewer mental health issues. Helicopter parenting has a price but like all wounds inflicted on a generation it takes decades before we see its full manifestation.", "Yes it was. And like I said. Total asshole for the overall situation. But the way the comments were talking I genuinely believe they meant they'd *never* leave a kid that age in a car for any length of time for any reason without regard  for the obviously ridiculous behavior of leaving her in the car all day while they were doing other stuff.\n\nLike they were literally dragging him as if it's not possible to be in a gas station for ten minutes grabbing drinks and snacks.", "I remember once we were driving home from the hospital. It was shortly after I had a kidney transplant when I was...Five or six. And because I was so immune suppressed I couldn't go in anywhere. My mom had to stop to pee. So she ran into a McDonald's, used the restroom. And grabbed herself a coffee and me some fries. I figure she couldn't have been gone more than ten minutes tops. And I remember this day because some asshole cops terrified me and were threatening to break the window if I didn't unlock the door and let them in. And I was scared because as a kindergartener all I really understood about the medical situation was \"I'd I was around people I didn't know I could get really sick and die.\" My mom reas them the riot act when she came out. \n\nGod forbid they walk inside the only building in miles which the vehicle was in the parking lot of and ask for the owner of the vehicle or scoping out the situation at all before terrifying a kindergartener and threatening to steal her. Even if I wasn't sick that was not the way to handle that situation. That was in 1996.\n\nAnd like. I only remember that because trauma. But I know it certainly happened frequently when I was a kid. And maybe a year or two after that I was walking to the gas station and grocery store and hardware store by myself, crossing rail road tracks to do it. It wasn't very far. Like a block and a half. But still. Train tracks. Alone. Around 7. And by 8 I was biking to school, across those same tracks, and add in a highway. And maybe another half mile down. And of course groups of friends were walking and biking all over town.to the park, and wandering around \"the woods with the creek\" which was really more... A few pieces of undeveloped property with a creek nearby than actual woods", "We know why the stay together. He said later on they apologized, and we know what that means. \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4c", "Usually, after marriage, it gets worse.", "Info: \nHave you asked Charlie how she's treated when you're not there?", "Okay, come on. This is the second major incident in 4 years. YES, this is 100% a deal breaker incident! YES, the first incident was not okay, but it was not an established pattern until NOW. That is STILL 4 years to look back at and unravel, not to mention figuring out housing arrangements and financials moving forward. It\u2019s important to process and plan for the sake of the stability of the children. ALL of the children. Accusing him of staying just for physical intimacy with just this amount of info is ridiculous.\n\nThat said, I agree with the second half of your comment. He needs to take care of his daughter and not continue to keep her in an unsafe situation, now that he knows what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nEdit: clarity", "Of course she did. Now that she's almost got what she wants and it's legally binding her true nature shows. The second she's wearing a ring and legally entitled to half his assets she will flip the switch and it'll be that much harder to get rid of her without losing nearly everything. RUN OP.", "This is reddit, so we\u2019ve heard much worse.  \n\nBut if OP doesn\u2019t kick this woman to the curb, his next post will be about how his new wife made his daughter move herself and all of her stuff into the attic or basement, to make space for the kids she sees 6 months out of the year, while he was working a 12 hour shift.  Or how she actually managed to make his daughter sick by feeding her old food.  \n\nThen, one day, OP\u2019s daughter will be on Reddit, telling horror stories of her evil step mother and step sisters and how her dad doesn\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nI hope OP wakes up and realizes, very soon, that his daughter has to come first.", "Your daughter deserves her own space. They are siblings who have grown up together: it will be far more of an adjustment for your daughter and she should be able to retreat from it when needed - especially if they gang up on her or such.", "\"Maybe next year\"?! \nDude, if you don't get your kid away from this awful woman, you will be failing as a parent. Your kid deserves better than this treatment, and if you don't break up and make sure your kid has a safe (and I mean emotionally and psychologically safe, not just physically), loving home, then you will be damaging your kid for life.", "And her dad wasn\u2019t informed.", "Truth! She just moved in and 2 months later you see her true colors. AND she left food for your kid, in the car, in the temperature danger zone, un refrigerated, for awhile. Your kid could get sick from it.", "He made a post asking whether he was even the asshole for being upset. Meanwhile he\u2019s the asshole for not telling this woman to move out of his home immediately.", "Ok but it\u2019s not the 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s anymore. It\u2019s not even legal in most places.", "Why wouldn't they switch schools? It actually happens quite often where parents share custody and live far apart. Kid gets registered at both schools and the administration is informed of the arrangement", "Or release them back into the wild.", "I felt the same way until someone backed into my car when my kid was waiting alone at around 9. I was about 30' away in an all glass atrium using an ATM. I heard her scream from inside. Sheer terror. Never, ever again. I don't judge other people for it, but I can't leave her and she would refuse to be left regardless. She's 100% fine home alone, but not in the car."]}
