She has two kids (12f, 15f) with shared custody. It\u2019s an odd arrangement, she has them Jan-June. Early September, she moved into our house. My daughter \u2018Charlie\u2019 is 10. For the record, up until recently she has been an amazing mother figure to Charlie. \n\nOur first issue was back in November as we discussed bedroom arrangements. She felt her eldest should have a room of her own while living here 6 months out of the year. That would cause Charlie to bunk with her youngest. I however did not allow it because that would encroach Charlie and likely cause her to feel alienated in her own home. \n\nLast weekend I was called in and worked a 12hr shift. When I arrived home, Charlie was upset because they went out to eat and left her home. She said when they came back, she was handed a bag of takeout and the food was stone cold. I asked my fianc\u00e9e to elaborate, to which she confirmed taking only her girls out to an early dinner then took them to play mini golf. Hence why the food was cold, it sat in the car as they played. \n\nShe kept deflecting to the food, saying she didn\u2019t expect her to eat it cold, she could have warned it up herself. I kept insisting it was extremely rude to exclude Charlie from the outing. She came back with\u2026\u201dBut I brought her food home.\u201d She then asked, \u201cWhy is it ok for you to go out with just Charlie?\u201d That\u2019s different, in the last 30 days her kids have been here, Charlie and I have only gone grocery shopping or on one occasion took her cat to the vet. That can\u2019t even be compared to what she did.\n\nWe didn\u2019t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t offend Charlie too.\u201d It pissed me off she said that, I called her feral. We both later apologized, but she then started the argument back up. She said it was so rude of me to argue about her taking her kids out. She further said, \u201cI don\u2019t see my kids for 6 months, excuse the hell out of me for wanting to spend time alone with them.\u201d \n\nI understood her point, but I felt like we could periodically plan separate outings on the same day so no one feels excluded. She kinda threw the bedroom ordeal in my face and said, \u201cMy kids might feel alienated from their own mother if they can\u2019t enjoy time alone with me.\u201d She made the pointless remark that her kids have no problem with her doing things with Charlie while they\u2019re living with their father. She further argued that there will be many times when Charlie will be excluded because of the age gap between her and the eldest. \n\nI told her if she expects things to workout, she would need to treat Charlie as one of her daughters. She said I was entirely missing her point because I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like having shared custody. Me scolding her for spending time with them as she said was a \u2018bitch-ass\u2019 move.", "created_utc": 1675698546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v9vrx/aita_for_arguing_with_my_fianc\u00e9e_after_she_left/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your fianc\u00e9 sounds very immature, and it sounds like you both need to work on your communication.\nYou\u2019re NTA but your fianc\u00e9 is for leaving a 10 year old home alone for that long and specifically excluding her from the outing.\ud83d\udea9", "NTA the way she went about this was terrible and hurtful to Charlie. She isn't wrong about making time for the children to hangout with their biological parent alone, but it should've been planned after a conversation. \n\nAlso it's crazy she thought her kid deserved their own room when they're not even there half the year.", "INFO: Who watched Charlie all day if you were working for 12hs and your fiance\u00e9 spent the day out with her daughters? \n\nI think you're NTA either way and your fiance\u00e9 is the the asshole. But if she left a 10 year old home alone all day while she and her daughters had a fun outing then she's not only an asshole but a neglecting step-parent. And your relationship issues are much bigger if that's the case. \n\nRegardless, your fiance\u00e9 is being manipulative. Her wanting alone time with her daughters is logical, but there are many ways in which she can get that that don't involve making Charlie feel excluded. Right now she's a full-blown evil stepmother, treating her daughters to dinner and an activity while leaving Cinderella home to pass the hours in company of singing mice. For me, this would be an absolute dealbreaker. You cannot let her treat your daughter like this. \n\nHer comparing going to the grocery store, the vet, or the dentist, to going out for dinner and mini golf is ridiculous. Unless you are going out for fun time with Charlie and excluding her daughters when they're living with you, then she has nothing against you on this. Errands and appointments are in no way the same as going out for fun and entertainment. \n\nYour proposal is perfectly reasonable: she can plan stuff to do with just her daughters and you plan something just with Charlie on that same day. You could also all go to the same place but agree to split, with you and Charlie doing your own thing, her and her daughters doing their own thing, and then all meeting up to share something all five together. \n\nTo me it seems she is resentful of not getting the exclusive room for her eldest. She might even resent that you have full custody of your child, or feel guilty that she spends more time (technically) with your daughter than with her own. But none of this gives her any right to mistreat a 10 year old girl this way. \n\nI'm sorry, but you should really think about marrying this woman.", "NTA.\n\nFrom this small snippet into your lives, it sounds like your fianc\u00e9e might be bullying your daughter (exclusion is a form of bullying).\n\nI think you need to sit down with Charlie and find out if anything else has been happening when she has been left alone with your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nLook, I understand your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s point of wanting to spend qt with her daughters, but it shouldn\u2019t be done at the expense of yours. She could have easily picked another day, where you were at home, to get that time in.  \n\nIt sounds like she is still upset about the bedroom situation and is using that as an excuse for her bad behaviour.\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA and you need to leave her ass", "NTA you\u2019re still with this woman why?

She could of picked up food at the very least after her mini golf adventure.", "NTA but you shouldn't ignore your fiancee red flags.... she sounds like she'd definitely pull the \"it's me or your daughter\" card.", "You have bigger issues than you seem to realize. This person is not going to be a good parental figure for your daughter and likely not a good partner to you. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for her to want quality time with her kids, but she\u2019s going about it in a terribly immature and mean way. \n\nYour compromise of prearranging separate trips on certain days was an excellent one, the fact that she rejected it so vehemently suggests there\u2019s something more to it than you are aware of. \n\nIf she really can\u2019t understand why the things she\u2019s saying and doing are messed up, you need to think deeply on if this is the kind of person you really want to share your life with. Do you really want to be with someone who sees nothing wrong with treating your daughter so callously?\n\nNTA, but this issue is bigger than Reddit. Good luck with resolving this as peacefully as possible.", "NTA for this situation, although I do think you and your fiancee really need to spend some time discussing things with regards to the kids, because whatever is happening is not working. It seems like some resentment is building and, if neither of you deal with that NOW (on both your ends), it's just going to fester until something happens. \n\nI think your fiancee has handled the situation poorly. She should not have left your daughter home alone for hours. It seems like she's bitter over the initial living arrangements. Maybe that influenced her to leave your daughter home, maybe not. She's not wrong in wanting to spend time with her kids, but she is wrong for neglecting your own daughter by leaving her alone. That is not ok and she needs to understand that taking her issues out on Charlie is not acceptable. If she wanted to spend time with her girls, she needed to find arrangements for Charlie first.\n\nI do think she has a point about her eldest needing her own room. 15 is an age that she probably doesn't want to share with siblings. Even if her daughters aren't with her all the time, it is still their home. Even if Charlie is there all the time, it doesn't mean she gets top priority every time. So you two really need to sit down and discuss this because there are so many issues just waiting to be brought up and you need to work that out BEFORE marriage.", "NTA. And this doesn't appear to be working out.", "NTA. \n\nIf this continues, Charlie will start to resent YOU for not protecting her and not standing up for her. (Rightfully so.) Your girlfriend sounds cruel. \n\nI would seriously reconsider building a life/family with this woman. Poor Charlie.", "NTA. There's a big difference between taking a kid to an appointment and taking them out for food and fun. When she's ditching Charlie in favor of her own daughters - that's very hurtful and damaging to Charlie. It's kinda the scene with the stepmom in Cinderella taking her own daughters to the ball and leaving the Cinderella behind.  Your fiance is totally looking out for just herself and her own daughters whenever she has them, and putting Charlie on a shelf. Once her daughters are gone, then she takes Charlie off the shelf and treats her nicer, simply because Charlie's there - not because she's interested in Charlie's well-being. I think she is showing you her true self when she has custody of her daughters.", "NTA, but for Charlie's sake, please don't marry this woman. She is going to be around your daughter 24/7, 365 days a year, but for half that time, your daughter is going to be ignored by her in favour of her biological children. Please put Charlie first.", "NTA\n\nYour fiancee leaving a 10yo alone like that is a red flag\n\nI get that she wants to spend time with just her bio kids and she should be able to, but it needs to be planned better. Your compromise to coordinate seems like a great idea. Or she could go out with her kids while Charlie is at a friend's house or with other family\n\nBut before focusing on finding a compromise I'd seriously think about whether you really want to marry a woman who left your young child alone for selfish and kind of petty reasons. Her kids will be there for a couple more months after all, it's not like this was her only opportunity to spend time with them", "NTA.\n\nYour fiancee did that on purpose to spite you for the room situation. She is pissed she didn't get her way, and she is gonna make Charlie pay for it. \n\n> We didn\u2019t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t offend Charlie too.\u201d \n\nThis makes me concerned for Charlie and kinda backs up my first point. She doesn't even acknowledge she did anything wrong, and thinks you taking issue with it is a result of Charlie being upset - as if you would've been OK with Charlie being left alone all day and eating cold food if she hadn't complained. \n\nShe has her kids 6 months out of the year, so I am sure there are plenty of other opportunities for her to have one-on-one time with them. The way she is treating Charlie isn't right, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is more stuff that just hasn't been brought to your attention. \n\nI wouldn't marry someone who is OK treating my 10 year old kid like that.", "NTA but girlfriend needs to go.  Protect your daughter.", "NTA.She for leaving a ten year old home alone. Plus serving her cold food that sat in the car. Never heard of that type of custody where parents have six month on six months off, they must stay in the same school district.

Leaving Charlie home alone all day and then picking up takeout but leaving it to sit in the car for however long and bringing it home cold is just thoughtless. It probably made Charlie feel like a second thought. And it's totally unfair of your wife to throw your one on one trips in your face when they were... grocery shopping and taking a pet to the vet. Not exactly fun parent-child outings. \n\nThe two of you will just have to plan things ahead and coordinate schedules going forward. If she really can't see why you were miffed that she left the 10 year old home alone and then brought her old cold food, that's pretty crappy.", "NTA. Charlie was disrespected in her own house.

Your number one priority is Charlie and if she is being neglected you need handle this immediately. You can not continue to leave her with your fiance. Id rethink this marriage.", "NTA.\n\nAs far as the bedroom thing, I don't think there's a right or wrong answer - while traditionally the oldest gets their own room, this isn't a traditional situation. But that's really a side issue here.\n\nLeaving a ten year old home alone while she goes for dinner/mini golf is completely unacceptable. That's \"evil stepmother\" territory. Yes, she wants and deserves time alone with her two bio kids, but that needs to be coordinated in advance (you don't just leave the youngest one at home alone, you make sure she has her own thing to do, preferably with her parent). \n\nWhile I realize this isn't a constant thing, I wonder if this is a good environment for your daughter. Is she going to be cut out and made to feel like this for six months a year, then when the stepsisters are gone be back to normal person status? That's not acceptable, please don't make her live that. If you think this kind of situation may happen again, you might need to take drastic measures.", "NTA. There\u2019s one on one time and then there\u2019s excluding someone. You are saying in the future that if they are going out just the 3 of them, plan with you ahead of time so Charlie has her own thing to do. You aren\u2019t trying to force them to bring her, just asking for consideration. This isn\u2019t older siblings going out with their friends on their own and half the year isn\u2019t a special occasion, it\u2019s who is supposed to be her family.

I do think it's worth discussing the room again, potentially with Charlie. Because you're doing something similar here... you're calling it her room and her house... when technically shouldn't it be the other two's home as well?

If your fiancee is supposed to treat Charlie like her daughter, then for most parents it would make sense to have 10F and 12F share a room so that 15F can have privacy.  Obviously whoever has to share should get the bigger bedroom.  So Charlie would have her own larger room for 6 months and share it with 12F the other 6.  You should also agree what happens when 15F turns 18.\n\nIt is OK for your fiancee to do things with her girls and not Charlie, occasionally.

She has two kids (12f, 15f) with shared custody. It\u2019s an odd arrangement, she has them Jan-June. Early September, she moved into our house. My daughter \u2018Charlie\u2019 is 10. For the record, up until recently she has been an amazing mother figure to Charlie. \n\nOur first issue was back in November as we discussed bedroom arrangements. She felt her eldest should have a room of her own while living here 6 months out of the year. That would cause Charlie to bunk with her youngest. I however did not allow it because that would encroach Charlie and likely cause her to feel alienated in her own home. \n\nLast weekend I was called in and worked a 12hr shift. When I arrived home, Charlie was upset because they went out to eat and left her home. She said when they came back, she was handed a bag of takeout and the food was stone cold. I asked my fianc\u00e9e to elaborate, to which she confirmed taking only her girls out to an early dinner then took them to play mini golf. Hence why the food was cold, it sat in the car as they played. \n\nShe kept deflecting to the food, saying she didn\u2019t expect her to eat it cold, she could have warned it up herself. I kept insisting it was extremely rude to exclude Charlie from the outing. She came back with\u2026\u201dBut I brought her food home.\u201d She then asked, \u201cWhy is it ok for you to go out with just Charlie?\u201d That\u2019s different, in the last 30 days her kids have been here, Charlie and I have only gone grocery shopping or on one occasion took her cat to the vet. That can\u2019t even be compared to what she did.\n\nWe didn\u2019t come to any sort of an agreement. Friday she was taking her girls to the dentist. On the way out she made the snarky comment, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t offend Charlie too.\u201d It pissed me off she said that, I called her feral. We both later apologized, but she then started the argument back up. She said it was so rude of me to argue about her taking her kids out. She further said, \u201cI don\u2019t see my kids for 6 months, excuse the hell out of me for wanting to spend time alone with them.\u201d \n\nI understood her point, but I felt like we could periodically plan separate outings on the same day so no one feels excluded. She kinda threw the bedroom ordeal in my face and said, \u201cMy kids might feel alienated from their own mother if they can\u2019t enjoy time alone with me.\u201d She made the pointless remark that her kids have no problem with her doing things with Charlie while they\u2019re living with their father. She further argued that there will be many times when Charlie will be excluded because of the age gap between her and the eldest. \n\nI told her if she expects things to workout, she would need to treat Charlie as one of her daughters. She said I was entirely missing her point because I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like having shared custody. Me scolding her for spending time with them as she said was a \u2018bitch-ass\u2019 move.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's subtle, but it does hint toward his relationship with them. It's not JUST about not giving them fake names. It's certain things he says, such as Charlie feeling alienated in her own home, implying that the home also doesn't belong with his fiancee's kids because they aren't there full time.\n\nSo, I think OP is overall not an asshole BUT I do question what his relationship is with his fiancee's kids if he already hints at him not thinking that it's their home too just because they are only there six months of the year. So, the incident is not on OP at all, but there's a deeper thing going on that might make him also responsible for issues that will definitely cause them problems if they don't talk about it now.", "I can see that - they definitely need to rethink blending these families."]}
