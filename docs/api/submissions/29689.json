His dad was a young single dad after my husband's mom died when he was a toddler. They had been really young when they had him and she was in a fatal accident when my husband was only 3. FIL raised my husband for 4 years alone and then met his wife Fran. Fran considers my husband her son but my husband considers her his stepmom and not his mom. One issue he has with both is how dismissive they were of his grief about his mom. FIL often dismissed any mention of it from my husband because he has no memories of his mom. He feels like where some parents grow and learn over time, his dad never fully grew like that and Fran always followed what she felt was right or what made her feel better without thinking of him.\n\nFran had a child before she married FIL. About 2 years before and he was given up for adoption.\n\nA few months ago and Fran reunited with her son. She learned he did not have a good childhood. Her son was very eager to have her in his life and when she and FIL were getting to know him and him them, they said he had an older brother (my husband) and he would have a full family. They never mentioned this to my husband until her son moved in with them and they wanted the two to meet for the first time. When we went over there her son was eager to jump right into a brotherly relationship with my husband and had this whole idea of how often they would see each other and what their relationship would be. My husband was honestly kind of weirded out at first and then he was pissed that his dad and Fran for making promises on his behalf.\n\nFIL and Fran were asking my husband to put \"his brother\" first and to help give him the family he didn't have growing up despite being adopted. My husband said they are not brothers and he wasn't going along with this. FIL then said he needed to, that they are brothers in every sense possible. My husband said they're not. That they are not blood related or related legally. He said they are strangers and he is an only child because neither FIL or his mom ever had kids.\n\nEver since my husband pulled back and FIL has been hot on his case about it. He always texts him or tries to force him to give in and go with what they want from him. When that didn't work he started with me until I muted him everywhere. But then he \"ran into me\" a few days ago and told me he needed me to talk my husband into being a better brother and coming around because his stepson craves it and it would make him and Fran happy too. I told him I would not harass my husband for him and he should listen to his 24 year old son who is an independent adult. FIL grew angry and asked me what sort of DIL accuses her FIL of harassment because he's trying to make his son see sense. He said I should be doing that as his wife and should be concerned that he treats non bio family so badly.

I was so excited to have a brother that might actually like me. My own full brother never did, and i dont speak to him anymore.

After her death biological siblings, aunts etc started crawling out from the woodwork and wanted to be in my wife's life.

However this is a very nuanced situation.  Often when adopted people are reunited with their bio parents they go through an infant stage for about 3-5 years where they act honestly like young children around their parent.  It often has massive effects on their friendships and the new and old family members.  Often it leads to the bio parent divorcing their significant other or the person in question losing their friends.  Alot of families go through what your husband is going through even when they are fully related to the adopted person where they feel completely disconnected to the person and don't want to connect with them for one reason or another.  That is your husband's choice to make.  My guess is it will probably raise emotions in the family at a time that is already very heightened.  But still it's his choice.  Boundaries can be healthy in any relationship.  \n\nI should say the only reason I know anything about this is cause my best friend since I was born is currently going through this.  He's currently pretty much at the end of his infant stage now.  But he lost most of his friends from it.

He flat out refused to discuss it with her saying he wasn\u2019t about to push her to do something that she clearly didn\u2019t want to do. It wound up that only one of the siblings wanted anything to do with \u201c daddy\u201d. Apparently, he knew his dad and had met him many times.He didn\u2019t seem broken up about her not wanting to meet him. \nIMO, her father was a pig. She already knew that before this happened. I believe she was willing to maintain a relationship with her father but expecting her to embrace these other people was a bridge too far. \nI was so proud of her for not buckling to the pressure. She\u2019s been gone for three years. I really miss her sweet spirit.", "NTA This is all about your stepmom\u2019s guilt over giving her son up. She and FIL are TA\u2019s and once again are putting their needs ahead of your husbands. I\u2019m so glad your husband is in counseling.", "This", "I don't understand why some people think blood doesn't matter, I know that some people feel that why and I support their right to feel that way, but it makes no sense to me.\n\nFamily is blood, you can hate them and be no contact, but the blood ties are objective facets of reality.\n\nWhereas any other kind of family is subject to \"changes\" of the heart.", "I don't think my husband is wrong though.", "The whole thing is bizarre. Husband owes nothing. FIL and his wife caused this whole thing by promising the wife's son a relationship with OP's husband. Well, guess what? Relationships aren't a third party's gift to give. They keep promising something that isn't theirs to give.\n\nThis would be true, BTW, even if the two were full blood brothers - but in this case, they are also literally unrelated by blood or upbringing.", "NTA.  It's harassment, he asked you once you said no.  That should have been the end of it.  Your husband's right, they're not brothers.  Besides, it's up to your husband and nobody else if he wants a relationship with this person.", "> the fact he was ostracized by his adopted family\n\nIt is so strange to me that someone would adopt an innocent baby, and then proceed to mistreat that child of its life. If they didn't want a child, why go through the trouble of adopting one? Human beings can be the most evil creatures.\n\n\nThat issue aside...\n\nBased on your other posts, your FIL was emotionally abusive to your husband. FIL's wife never considered your husband's perspective; she used him to meet her own maternal needs. \n\nNTA. Support your husband. Do not give in to the manipulation of FIL and his wife.", "MTA - Tell your FIL if he had been a better father and Fran had been a better step mother when your husband was growing up there might have been a chance. Now they are seeing the consequences for their past actions.", "> Therapy has been good for him and he finally has a professional telling him it's okay to grieve his mom, etc.\n\nI\u2019m so glad he\u2019s finally getting the support he needs in this. \n\nThe thing about grief that a lot of people don\u2019t understand is that when we lose a loved one, we don\u2019t just grieve for the past we shared with them, we also grieve for the future that can never be. My dad died when I was young, and part of my grief was that if I ever got married, he wouldn\u2019t be there. If I ever had children, he\u2019d never hold them or sing to them or play with them. \n\nYour husband\u2019s dad thinks he shouldn\u2019t be grieving because he doesn\u2019t remember his mom, which is a double gut punch because the lack of memories is probably the exact thing that he\u2019s grieving. The memories he and his mom never got to make together. That kind of grief is incredibly normal, and it\u2019s a common part of the process for a lot of us who either lose a parent at a young age or lose a young child.", "> He would tell my husband he couldn't be grieving his mom since he never met her, or that he wasn't sad about her being dead because he had Fran or saying he didn't want to hear it.\n\nYour FIL was emotionally abusive to your husband. \n\nFor your husband's sake, you need to have very clear boundaries with FIL.", "Why did Fran put her son for adoption when he was 2 years old? Am I misunderstanding something, or did she abandon him to remake her life with your FIL?", "He\u2019s missing out on a lot if he does reject his brother by stepmom. \n\nI hope he knows that.", "Because blood doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nBlood is just a lineage passed from parent to child. \n\nA family is something you make, build, grow. \n\nA family matters, blood is just biology.", "I didn't see a problem with anything they ever did. You mentioned his father never grew as a person like what's that even mean? His father raised the man you fell in love with so he can't be that bad.", "Our wedding was the moment for him where he really felt the future that was stolen from them. When we were planning the wedding there were many mentions of father/daughter dances but also mother/son dances in stuff we read and I think there was a pain for him in seeing that knowing it was not an option for him. I wore a piece of jewelry of his moms on my wedding day and he carried something of hers in his pocket the whole day. She was with us. But the fact she was with us in that way was devastating for him.", "I don't really think he'll miss out if he's simply not interested.", "Dude I have two full brothers that I haven\u2019t seen in over 20 years and I\u2019m not missing out. Some people don\u2019t want that extended family feel. Respect others choices.", "My husband said he never grew as a parent. He dismissed the loss my husband felt regarding his mom. He might not remember her but that is still a loss. He was robbed of having his mom with him through his life. He was told it wasn't possible he could miss her. He was told how he felt repeatedly. They said he had Fran so there was no way he could or should miss someone he didn't remember. Throughout his life there are moments he thought about his mom and was sad she wasn't there and he was told he didn't feel that way.\n\nI know there were times where people dismissed that kind of loss on young kids, though we're not that old. But even today my FIL would not admit my husband suffered a loss and feels the grief associated with it and Fran was not a substitute for that mom for my husband. No matter how much they wanted her to be. My husband still felt that loss.", "> His father raised the man you fell in love with so he can't be that bad.\n\nPlenty of people are great in spite of their upbringing, not because of it.", "I completely understand. It\u2019s such a hard thing when your happiest moments are also a little bit sad, because a person who should be there with you isn\u2019t. I\u2019m holding you and your husband in my heart and hoping all good things for you both."]}
