His dad was a young single dad after my husband's mom died when he was a toddler. They had been really young when they had him and she was in a fatal accident when my husband was only 3. FIL raised my husband for 4 years alone and then met his wife Fran. Fran considers my husband her son but my husband considers her his stepmom and not his mom. One issue he has with both is how dismissive they were of his grief about his mom. FIL often dismissed any mention of it from my husband because he has no memories of his mom. He feels like where some parents grow and learn over time, his dad never fully grew like that and Fran always followed what she felt was right or what made her feel better without thinking of him.\n\nFran had a child before she married FIL. About 2 years before and he was given up for adoption.\n\nA few months ago and Fran reunited with her son. She learned he did not have a good childhood. Her son was very eager to have her in his life and when she and FIL were getting to know him and him them, they said he had an older brother (my husband) and he would have a full family. They never mentioned this to my husband until her son moved in with them and they wanted the two to meet for the first time. When we went over there her son was eager to jump right into a brotherly relationship with my husband and had this whole idea of how often they would see each other and what their relationship would be. My husband was honestly kind of weirded out at first and then he was pissed that his dad and Fran for making promises on his behalf.\n\nFIL and Fran were asking my husband to put \"his brother\" first and to help give him the family he didn't have growing up despite being adopted. My husband said they are not brothers and he wasn't going along with this. FIL then said he needed to, that they are brothers in every sense possible. My husband said they're not. That they are not blood related or related legally. He said they are strangers and he is an only child because neither FIL or his mom ever had kids.\n\nEver since my husband pulled back and FIL has been hot on his case about it. He always texts him or tries to force him to give in and go with what they want from him. When that didn't work he started with me until I muted him everywhere. But then he \"ran into me\" a few days ago and told me he needed me to talk my husband into being a better brother and coming around because his stepson craves it and it would make him and Fran happy too. I told him I would not harass my husband for him and he should listen to his 24 year old son who is an independent adult. FIL grew angry and asked me what sort of DIL accuses her FIL of harassment because he's trying to make his son see sense. He said I should be doing that as his wife and should be concerned that he treats non bio family so badly. I was told I should be doing far better by my husband and his family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698312145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gsh1l/aita_for_telling_my_fil_that_i_wont_harass_my/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I feel like I could be an asshole in this dispute is because of the word choice I used and the fact I know my FIL is being unreasonable in this and I kind of fanned the flames of this by using a word like harass, which, while I feel is true, is not going to be well received by the person being told this. And I feel like I could have and should have done better here.

Its a messy sounding situation thats mixing a lot of old feelings, regrets and resentments up again and they dont seem to be taking any time to think about your husbands feelings. \n\nIt might be good for the new step-son for him to be brotherly, but if its not good for your husband then that doesnt matter. \n\nSupport your husband through this, he should be your priority in the situation especially since he doesn't seem to be anyone elses", "NTA\n\nIf it sounds, looks and is experienced like harassment, IT IS HARASSMENT. \n\nTime for hubs to lay out some  boundaries and consequences for stomping over them.

Poor dude, what a mess\u2026", "NTA, put your husband's well-being first. His father and stepmother are being incredibly inconsiderate. She is trying to make up for the rough childhood she has because she feels responsible, but forcing your husband into this situation isn't fair. I would address it quickly and firmly to avoid feelings being too hurt. Set the boundary for future discussions too.", ">FIL and Fran were asking my husband to put \"his brother\" first\n\n>FIL then said he needed to, that they are brothers in every sense possible.\n\nThese are advanced levels of delusion and fantasy.\n\n>FIL grew angry and asked me what sort of DIL accuses her FIL of harassment\n\nThe sort who cares about her husband. Perhaps he lives in a house where the wife tells the husband what to do. NTA.", "NTA and if they dont back off they will lose contact altogether with your husband. it does suck for the other son though.  Having expectations of a big brother that is loving and caring only to find out thats not really the case.  The M/F inlaws arent giving your husband the chance to even grow a relationship organically,\n\nI found out i had a half brother when i was 25/26 yo.  I was so excited to have a brother that might actually like me. My own full brother never did, and i dont speak to him anymore.  I learned really quickly that i wasnt going to be able to forge a relationship with half brother. It did sadden me because i did fantasize having a great relationship. But  at the end of it, he was a stranger that i wasnt going to be friends with, And i moved on", "NTA\n\nNot the asshole in any way or form. Your husband doesn't even feel that close to his step mom, so why should he feel anything at all for the son she gave up and he never met?\n\nMy wife was adopted, and she met her birth mother just before she (birth mother) died. After her death biological siblings, aunts etc started crawling out from the woodwork and wanted to be in my wife's life. But it just made her very uncomfortable and she wanted no part of it. \n\nIf your FIL and his wife want your husband to bond with her son, it has to come naturally and not be forced upon him. If they continue badgering and guilting him he might distance himself from them even more.", "NTA. Forced relationships never work. At best, it builds up resentment between the parties involved.", "NTA", "NTA get a restraining order", "NTA.\n\nFIL and his wife are both crazy. Your husband has no connection to this alleged brother, and does not want one.\n\nCut contact.", "NTA. Fil has a history of trying to dictate how your husband should feel. Now hes trying to do the same to you. Personally, I think you shoukd cobsider relocating out of fil's reach.", "NTA - I\u2019d like to hear FIL explain how 2 people who have never met and have no blood or legal connection are \u2018brothers in every sense possible\u2019", "NTA. this will result in NC along the way if they push further", "I vote yall change your numbers & cut contact.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAlthough this is a very tricky situation. Especially for Fran\u2019s son who most likely grew up in an abusive family. Finds another family who seems to genuinely love him. Only for his \u2018brother\u2019 to blow him off before they\u2019ve met. \n\nI probably would have gone NAH, until FIL and Fran were trying to force husband to meet. \n\nInfo: can you clarify on the fil dismissing the grief like did he just never talking about his ex wife?", "Personally I'd say not the asshole just because you were standing up for your husband and trying to help him.  However this is a very nuanced situation.  Often when adopted people are reunited with their bio parents they go through an infant stage for about 3-5 years where they act honestly like young children around their parent.  It often has massive effects on their friendships and the new and old family members.  Often it leads to the bio parent divorcing their significant other or the person in question losing their friends.  Alot of families go through what your husband is going through even when they are fully related to the adopted person where they feel completely disconnected to the person and don't want to connect with them for one reason or another.  That is your husband's choice to make.  My guess is it will probably raise emotions in the family at a time that is already very heightened.  But still it's his choice.  Boundaries can be healthy in any relationship.  \n\nI should say the only reason I know anything about this is cause my best friend since I was born is currently going through this.  He's currently pretty much at the end of his infant stage now.  But he lost most of his friends from it.  Most of the stuff I just said was copy pasted from what his therapist emailed me a few a years ago.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's going to push his son away completely and he will have no one to blame but himself.", "You're NTA. You and your husband may need to see an attorney, about getting a cease and desist letter sent to delusional FIL and his equally fantasizing wife. Her biological son's desire for a \"real\" family is understandable, and verges on tragic, but he isn't legally or biologically related to your husband at all. Any relationship has to be voluntary, and your husband is absolutely not volunteering. His father's refusal to take \"no\" for an answer, not to mention his pouncing on you in public; is indeed harassment, and if you need to take legal action to stop it, you should.", "NTA. Your husband's wants don't become irrelevant because the lost son wants something different. I hope the kid is getting therapy with Fran and FIL. \n\nFIL and Fran shouldn't have made promises about your husband's involvement. Some blood siblings aren't close, family doesn't guarantee a close relationship.", "Wowww, the entitlement is strong with your FIL. He ignored his own son\u2019s grief his entire life, but wants same son to acknowledge someone else\u2019s pain and desire for family\u2026\n\nYour obligation is to your family: your husband.

I would never go behind his back and would never pressure him the way his dad and stepmom pressure him. Honestly, the one good thing from this is my husband entered therapy to help him work through some of the old frustration after some new ones mixed with the old ones. Therapy has been good for him and he finally has a professional telling him it's okay to grieve his mom, etc.\n\nThings are very messy though and we both feel bad for Fran's son. Mostly because he's young but he seems even younger from the interaction we had with him. I can tell he's desperate for a family to be part of and latches on quickly like a young kid might and we're pretty sure the fact he was ostracized by his adopted family is the biggest reason for that. And yeah, while it would be great for him to have my husband as a brother, it's not something that would be great for my husband.\n\nThe people who can't see that or don't care to are FIL and Fran.", "He would tell my husband he couldn't be grieving his mom since he never met her, or that he wasn't sad about her being dead because he had Fran or saying he didn't want to hear it. Both used the Fran excuse and not wanting to hear it thing. They also both told him he wasn't actually grieving her.", "I think a lot of it for my husband comes down to how he views his family and a big factor for him is likely not seeing Fran as his mom so her son, to him, would not be a sibling. Plus he never really felt like he missed out by not having siblings so there's a lot for him that would factor into his feelings.", "It sounds as if FIL has never viewed your husband as an independent person, capable of his own needs and feelings. FIL thought he could order a child to accept a new woman as his mother, discard his feelings for his actual mother, and now, accept as a new \"brother\", a total stranger who is not actually related to him in any sense; not legally or biologically. It's nuts, and entirely self-serving on the part of FIL. He is still refusing to take his own child's feelings into account. FIL expects everyone to bow to what he wants.

Until your husband is in a good place himself, he can't give his father's wife's son the love he craves.\n\nY'all are doing the right thing by making sure your husband is in a good place first and foremost. You can have compassion for Fran's son without being obligated to resolve his issues.", "Therapy is definitely a positive in a situation like this.  I would imagine that theres a lot of complicated feelings on all side and having a professional to talk to about it should help him a lot.  I do feel bad for Frans son in all this.  He hasn't had an easy life and he walked into a messy situation but I understand your husbands decision to keep himself separate at least for now. \nWho knows maybe in the future they might develop a close relationship when both people are in a good place qnd can do that without damaging their own mental health.", "I'm sorry FIL (and Fran) can't and haven't ever been able to see your husband for himself and with his own needs. It's always been about what they want and believe is right - how it crushes your husband is beside the point.\n\nIt's clear the FIL's pressure is pretty unrelenting, but don't let him get into your head. You post makes it clear that you understand the situation extremely well. And you are very clear on your priority.\n\nI'm sorry this is hard on everyone involved and that it is further damaging (you and) your husband's relationship with his dad/Fran. It is great that your husband is in therapy. That enables you both to move forward in the best way possible, whatever FIL/Fran come to understand or continue failing to understand."]}
