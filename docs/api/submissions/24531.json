One comment that really stung was when one of the friends moms said I am much darker than your mother yet how are you darker than my daughter.... Now this isnt my friends fault at all but this is to give you guys an idea. So 10 years ago i got on my hyperpigmenation lightening journey and tbh it failed, i improved the scarring only to relapse. Also since i had a limited budget and pressure from school tbh it was bound to fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward 9 years later I am now finacially well off and decide that i want to take my skin care journey more seriously. I wont lie I was more into fixing my skin texture and making it more plump and healthy rather than reducing my hyperpigmentation. I got onto an anti-inflammatory diet, started using creams to heal my dry skin, got allergies under control, also got my stress under control. This cleared my eczema and made my skin \"tougher\". I decided to tackle the hyperpigmentation by adding a soap that exfoliates skin harshly, I used this and failed 10 years ago but this time since I had more knowledge on making my sensitive skin \"tougher\" I ultimately started lightening my hyperpigmentation very fast. I also used exfoliating lotions and toners, and some serums that have ingredients that lighten dark spots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the problem is my friends are jealous and holier than thou about my results. They constantly point out how its impossible to lighten like that with just stuff you get legally off amazon. At the same time they try to egg me on to \"spill my secrets\" I actually suggested these ppl to use a vit c serum and a maybe get on a retinol if theyd like to lighten dark spots but i refuse to let them know about anything more. Mainly bc I know I would be giving them unrealistic expectations. These women have healthy even toned soft skin. I really dont want them to use my products that i used bc first of all it wont work the same for them the way it worked for me this is due to them being naturally genetically dark and I know they want to get lighter (aka i know colorism runs in their fam and deep rooted in them). Second of all the things I use are harsh and the reason i can use them is bc I know how to know how much my skin can handle, i follow a strict diet and have the humidifier on to keep my skin \"tough\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Doesnt want to spill skin secrets bc I know my regime is very advanced and i know they have unrealistic expectations", "created_utc": 1691892026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pmbag/aita_for_not_telling_my_friends_my_skin_care/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So the products wouldn't work the same way for them", "NTA. Your medical history / journey is tied up in this and you are under no obligation to share that with anyone. If it was simply a case of saying \"I use xbrand cream\" that would be different, but you would have to explain several medical issues that must have been very difficult to deal with.", "NAH really.  I guess you could copy & paste how you explained it here & send it to them, but it sounds like you\u2019ve already tried to explain it. The short version is that you previously had medical conditions that made your skin darker, and good medical care has it back to your natural born shade. So it wouldn\u2019t have the same effect on someone whose skin is just genetically darker.\n\n  \nSaying this as a light-skinned, freckley, red-headed white woman fwiw- it makes me sad that so many dark skinned people feel life would be better if they were lighter, and it makes me even sadder -and angry- that they\u2019re probably right. If the world was as it should be, your friends wouldn\u2019t even be asking for your secrets!", "NAH, but it's not your place to gate keep their health. \n\nYour infantilizing your friends by making all kinds of judgements for them and deciding what is best for them.", "NTA and anyone who votes YTA fails to consider that you\u2019re not a dermatologist and your friends\u2019 skincare is not your job. It\u2019s not \u201cgatekeeping\u201d and only a 14 year old would think so. If your friends want to figure it out beyond the basic steps you gave them they can go see a dermatologist and get something that works for THEM. Everyone\u2019s skin is different.", "Sheesh just tell em, the results are not your responsibility ESH", "YTA for not explaining that it\u2019s a medical condition", "YTA and I don\u2019t think these girls should consider you a friend.\n\nYou called then \u201cjealous and holier than thou\u201d about your skin. \n\nYou told us your skin routine- it\u2019s not a secret! You just love the fact that you found something that works, while they are still searching for something.", "NTA. What you do to your body and put on your body is none of your friends business. They don\u2019t have the same skin type as you and don\u2019t have the same skin tone as you either. If their results turn out poorly they will try to blame you and say you purposely told them to use bad products when it\u2019s really just that these products are not meant for their skin. And these commenters that say you are \u201cgatekeeping skincare\u201d are absolutely ridiculous. You are buying regular over the counter products from amazon that anyone else can buy too, you just put in the time and effort and research to find a routine that works for you and your friends can do the same.", "Yta.  You say it's because they can't handle it but you're basically gate keeping skin care and that's weird.", "NTA - I also have really bad hyperpigmentation bc of eczema and now I have to get laser treatment, the same one they use for tattoo removal. It does work and my skin does look amazing afterwards, there are 3 people in my whole life that know about this. I don't want others to know, I don't want to talk about my eczema, I don't want their advice, I don't want to disclose how expensive the treatment is....and I don't owe it to anybody and neither do you esp since it's health related.", "NTA, but it seems simpler to me to find new friends. You already have to invest a lot of time in your skincare, defending yourself like this seems like too much.", "Damn bro just say you want to gatekeep those products. Yta", "NTA, but post doesn\u2019t make sense since when we\u2019re you hinted to being TA?  I do think it\u2019s weird though. Just because why not just explain it to them instead? Just say that it\u2019ll be harsh on their skin but without that explanation it just seems like you don\u2019t want them to have good skin", "YTA for trying to gatekeep skincare. Just tell them what you do and let them make their own decisions. seems like you just don\u2019t want them to have the success you\u2019ve had with your lightening creams.", "YTA. \u201cGaslight Gatekeep Girlboss\u201d is a joke, not actual advice. Please just tell them the whole story, and they\u2019ll probably understand", "NTA, it\u2019s a personal question involving complex feelings about colourism, changes in your appearance you weren\u2019t in control of and your actual medical history. You owe nobody anything and your first \u201cno\u201d was a complete sentence. Conversation over.", "nta. i'm a gatekeeping girlie. i found an incredible daily retinol for $30 that changed my skin. it's never been more perfect, and i'm not telling anyone. i want to have the best skin!!!! \n\nfuck ya'll. find it on your own.", "\nYTA \nYou\u2019re not doing it for them, you\u2019re doing it for you.
