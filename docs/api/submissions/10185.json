My wife is not a finance person so I\u2019m in charge of keeping track of our finances and allocating money accordingly.\n\nWe each get our own \u201callowance money\u201d each time I\u2019m paid since I make over twice as much as she does. We split the allowance total in half so we each get some semi-monthly. Her incomes goes to paying the bills. \n\nWe recently found out that we owed a few thousand in taxes. I got into an argument with her that if we did not have ANY fun money for just 2 months and using some of our savings, we\u2019d be able to pay off our tax debt.\n\nShe was strongly against taking fun money from her. I told her it\u2019s just two months and she said she didn\u2019t care. I said I\u2019m willing to do that completely with my half of the money. She said no she needed at least some so we settled on a small amount for her instead, which is about 1/4 of what her spending money is. She said she needed it for her make up and some skin care products.\n\nJust felt really annoyed that she wasn\u2019t willing to sacrifice just 2 months to pay off a debt owed to the fucking government. It\u2019s not like some stupid debt that I ran up on my own and I\u2019m asking her to pay it off for me. This is BOTH of our debts.\n\nEdit: just to be clear. 90% of her income goes to paying the bills. The rest 10% we put it towards \u201cdate night fund\u201d for us to go out and enjoy ourselves. My income pays for the remaining parts of the bills, savings & investing, and the left over is for fun money\n\nEDIT 2: I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t. Seem to understand. Maybe y\u2019all are not reading it. Yes she does give 90% of her income to bills but it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t make much!! I also contribute to the rest because he income doesn\u2019t even COVER all the bills. The rest goes into cash savings and investing for our retirement. The REST is our fun money and we get EQUAL amount.

Then her income getting added to his plus the new bracket will have changed the income.\n\nThere is a way to do additional withholdings just Incase but the trick is finding out exactly how much so that you aren't giving more.\n\nOur accountant just has us withhold almost nothing extra and we sort it out at the end of the year.", "We just explained you can't always know what your going to owe.... sometimes just getting a slight raise can all of a sudden make you owe.  Even the Tax experts to know everything.  This is very VERY common for some stupid little thing you overlook or don't realize is a problem makes you owe.", "Saying \"in charge\"...at least in my neck of the woods...has always just meant that you did the finances.  As well the person \"in charge\" of the fiances while not making dictator like decisions, will make the financial plans.  Added to it...Make up is not something I see a \"hygiene\" products.", "All of her money goes towards the necessities and some of mine does too. I didn\u2019t decide to do that. We AGREED that we should put the rest to savings and investing and how much spending we get. If you want to talk about fairness, I\u2019m the one making 2x her salary and I get the SAME spending $ as her.", "Sure that\u2019s YOUR case. You are not OP, or his wife, and if majority of her money is going to the bills while his isn\u2019t  - it\u2019s obvious why she\u2019d want to keep her fun money. \n\nAlso he\u2019s in charge of the finances, and is obviously not doing a great job considering the back taxes due. It\u2019s very suspect.", "so this is the thing though. i\u2019ve been doing my own taxes since my first job at fifteen and and so has my mother (the \u201cbill organizer\u201d in the relationship)\u2014my parents will often file separately, but my mom will complete the filings themselves. it\u2019s not rocket science. there are years where it\u2019s joint, years where it\u2019s not, but always slightly more conservative with withholdings in a new job to accommodate for tax changes. repayment is split 75/25 towards any debt favouring the overhead from my father\u2019s income, as it\u2019s much higher and easier to tighten.\n\nin the almost two decades since, i have never owed taxes even with investments and contractor+freelancer taxes work, and in the 30+ years of their marriage, my parents have only needed to pay back a few times\u2014and marginal amounts in the 200-500$ish range. while we lived frugally as a working class family, i also didn\u2019t really want for anything\u2014i feel very lucky to have gotten an education in this sort of thing young. \n\n\u201csorting things out\u201d at the end of the year is just a risk a lot of people can\u2019t take regardless of how much they\u2019re making (or think they\u2019re making), jointly or separately, and OP\u2019s situation is that exactly.", "Not the exact figure, sure. But you should know a ballpark % of your income and plan accordingly and set aside slightly more than you think you need just incase if you can afford it. Lets be honest, OP makes 2 times his wife's salary and they are saving and investing, so they can afford to set aside slightly more \"tax money\" each month. This sounds like a planning issue, not a money issue.", "Fair enough. I would not have persisted in my opinion if the rest of the post had taken a different tone. Why is her counter-offer of keeping a small amount of fun money unreasonable? \n\nOP states elsewhere in his comments that any personal supplies count as fun money. Someone else brought up the issue of deodorant demonstrating where there was a problem in the financial plan. Others have brought up \"skin care\" items as a necessity rather than a vanity purchase. Given that she is employed, I view make-up as potentially necessary.\n\nI had not really expected so much resistance to my comment. I'll just say that the tone came off wrong to me. You are, of course, welcome to view it as you see appropriate.", "Then how come it didn't occur to you to cut back on the investments and savings for a couple months along with a bit of a cut to spending money to cover your debt instead of ensuring no money on hand for 2 months? With her refusal to be left totally broke for 2 months, I wonder how she would take that idea?", "It sounds like your current system could use some adjustments. My husband makes more than I do and we agree a joint standard of living that's fits within both our budgets and leaves us with our own spending money. Right now he has more to spend than I do but it means if one of us wants to save towards upgrading our cars or a big purchase we don't need to ask the other.\n\nYou might want to consider individual savings so that if stuff like this comes up in the future you don't need to compromise and it seems that's the area you're struggling with here.", "All of their money is being divided up between bills, savings, investments, date night and fun money. It's just the fun money is being paid into their accounts on his pay day. Both of their salaries are going towards the regular expenses", "If op is lying about the finances, there really is no point to this whole aita because the whole thing is about the finances.", "Majority of her income goes to bills becuase she doesn\u2019t make as much. Idk if you read or not but I ALSO contribute part of my income to the bills. The rest goes to savings and investing. And then we get EQUAL fun money. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m taking all the damn money and going on a shopping spree while she has nothing.", ">while his isn\u2019t\n\nOP has broken down the money. They each have equal fun money every month. His money us used to pay all their other expenses, retirement and savings. What they each have is literally in the post.", "Again...THIS IS COMMON.  It happens to the majority of Americans every year because the Tax Code changes Every..Fucking...year.  Unless you ARE a financial/Tax expert or can afford one... you get fucked.  End of story.", "First of all, it's THEIR debt, not his and BOTH of them would give up their fun money (both of them get an EQUAL amount). You don't cut back on investments and savings if you can easily maneuver around a financial hurdle.", "I\u2019m not lying lol", "Idk, he already tried to be misleading by implying the debt was both of their doing when in all reality, he jacked up the taxes by not updating his withholdings.", "That's not the point I'm making. \n\nOP should plan to put more aside then he thinks he needs! (if you can afford it). Clearly OP has a lot of savings, he's investing in the S&P 500 every month, he just doesn't want to remove any savings/investments.", "Don't worry, people on this sub always find a reason to view the man as the bad guy.\n\nI would try to find a compromise. Maybe leave a little more \"fun money\" and pay the debt in 3-4 months instead of 2?"]}
