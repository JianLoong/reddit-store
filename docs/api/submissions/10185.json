My wife is not a finance person so I\u2019m in charge of keeping track of our finances and allocating money accordingly.\n\nWe each get our own \u201callowance money\u201d each time I\u2019m paid since I make over twice as much as she does. We split the allowance total in half so we each get some semi-monthly. Her incomes goes to paying the bills. \n\nWe recently found out that we owed a few thousand in taxes. I got into an argument with her that if we did not have ANY fun money for just 2 months and using some of our savings, we\u2019d be able to pay off our tax debt.\n\nShe was strongly against taking fun money from her. I told her it\u2019s just two months and she said she didn\u2019t care. I said I\u2019m willing to do that completely with my half of the money. She said no she needed at least some so we settled on a small amount for her instead, which is about 1/4 of what her spending money is. She said she needed it for her make up and some skin care products.\n\nJust felt really annoyed that she wasn\u2019t willing to sacrifice just 2 months to pay off a debt owed to the fucking government. It\u2019s not like some stupid debt that I ran up on my own and I\u2019m asking her to pay it off for me. This is BOTH of our debts.\n\nEdit: just to be clear. 90% of her income goes to paying the bills. The rest 10% we put it towards \u201cdate night fund\u201d for us to go out and enjoy ourselves. My income pays for the remaining parts of the bills, savings & investing, and the left over is for fun money\n\nEDIT 2: I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t seem to understand. Maybe y\u2019all are not reading it. Yes she does give 90% of her income to bills but it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t make much!! I also contribute to the rest because he income doesn\u2019t even COVER all the bills. The rest goes into cash savings and investing for our retirement. The REST is our fun money and we get EQUAL amount.

Present value of money, it's worth more now than later, and that doesn't include personal feeling about debt.\n\n\nFor example, if you have a year of interest rate free period, you can invest the debt into a GIC (guaranteed income) at let's say 5% (they pretty high now but maybe not a year long one), then if you owed 1000, you'd get 50$ before you have to pay the debt. I personally paid off my student loan instantly, but kinda regretted it because I could have had a bigger downpayment and we could have gotten something better, and the interest rate would have been 0 (on the federal portion of the debt) so I would have had time to pay it off.\n\n\nDebt isn't a boogey man, you have to know the timing to pay it off. \n\n\nIf you throw all you resources into paying the debt in 2 months when you have 6 months no interest to pay, what if you have an emergency and need cash during those two months? You would borrow money at a pretty high interest rate until you pay it off. \nNow onto the wife, since it's pooled money, BOTH of your opinions matter on handling the debt. Her way is no worst than your way, in fact it's better to take advantage of the interest rate free period. You can't expect her to drop everything for w months when she doesn't have to. Your being controlling on how to handle the debt. Pooler money? So compromise, she wants it longer, you want it shorter.

What OP is suggesting is paying the taxes with THEIR fun money for two months.  So if the both get $200 the total tax bill $1,600.  The goal is to have it paid before 4/15 otherwise fees and penalties start accruing.  If they stretch it out to three months then they pay the original tax debt plus a month of penalties which can be 2% compounded daily which changes every day.  So OP wanting to pay it off before the deadline is the best thing to do to avoid paying more.  \n\nThe other option is to make sure both of them check their tax withholding (w-4) and make sure they have it correct.  Sometimes people follow the government guidelines and claim the number the worksheet tells them.  This is never to your benefit in the long term.  This is designed to give you more money in your paycheck but when tax time comes you\u2019ll owe much more than before.  For example the IRS suggests you always claim yourself, 65+, blind, all children, any qualified adults who may not be related but live in your home that you care for.  So assuming your 25, married with 1 child the IRS expects each you to claim at least 1 then the child.  So who ever makes the most would claim 2 and the other just one.  While this is great in theory you pay less in taxes.  To avoid paying at the end of the year never claim yourself only the child on one and nothing on the other.  If you have no children claim \u201cZERO\u201d. This still won\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t pay at the end but you\u2019ll pay less.  I have no children claim zero and still had to pay this year.

I think the problem comes because they have alloted 100% of her income. So she really has no saying on anything. Only half her income should be put into house builds and stuff, and the other half should be used for fun money and investments. \n\nRight now she has no autonomy and no say on her money because her husband gives her an allowance. And now he wants to take it away from her. \n\nAlso I don't know, but it makes me uneasy the arrangement they have. I remember someone having a similar division in some old post and facing an issue where since her money was only used for expenses, she was having problems to claim anything over the investments. \n\nOne thing is your wife not being knowledgeable about finances, something else is to have her in the dark and with no autonomy.\n\nShe needs to be more involved. OP needs to explain her everything. I mean what happens if OP gets sick? His wife has no clue about what is going on.\n\nYTA. How can you condider it is OK to have your wife for two whole months with no extra cash? She is asking to buy skincare products for God's sake.

I do 100% of household and grocery shopping and about 75% of dining out. I know my weakness is saving money, while my husband is strong at it. So he pays his mortgage and the electric and gas bill monthly and the remaining dining out budget and we tend to split Costco costs depending on who shops so around 50/50.  He puts a ton into savings for us while not having to worry about much. \n\nThat said, we owed taxes too the other year and we both agreed to be more careful about spending to put the amount back into savings. \n\nAlso self care is absolutely a treat and tends to be higher for females. I get mani pedis at times with girlfriend, but if things are tighter, I skip and I go once every few months.  Alone they are $75-$80 as I get dip or gel to make them last longer. I also get monthly massages that he does not (my LMT has a 25% discount for going monthly effectkvely making a 90 minute massafs the cost of a 60), and that is one luxury i wont up bc i pay for it. And of course hair is more expensive for women. I go about every 10-12 weeks for $150,  every 3 weeks for $35. \n\n\nI think they need to restructure their spending.
