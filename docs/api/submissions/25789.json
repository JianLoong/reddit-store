I was an involved dad when she was young and we were close. But when she was in her teens I cheated on her mother. My daughter didn\u2019t accept the divorce well. What she didn\u2019t and still doesn\u2019t understand is while her mother might be the best mother in her eyes, my ex wasn\u2019t the perfect wife. I\u2019m not saying what I did was right and I\u2019m not trying to wiggle out of accepting responsibility for my decision to cheat. If I had a chance to do things differently I would\u2019ve divorced her mother first. It took me years of counselling to get over PTSD from my ex wife\u2019s emotionally abusive behaviour. I tried my best to stay in my daughter\u2019s life but since she was old enough to decide, court couldn\u2019t enforce visitation. I paid child support and extra on top for extra curriculars. I was involved in her life as much as she would let me. Periodically I would reach out and kept the door open. We catch up once in a while. \n\nNow, last catch up she tells me she\u2019s getting married. I know of him but I\u2019ve never been introduced to her fianc\u00e9.

I told her I would think about it and she said I suck as a dad if I don\u2019t support her. AITA for not forking out for the wedding?

I do blame her for saying that you \"suck as a dad if \\[you\\] don\u2019t support her.\" That's just trying to take advantage of you, it's empty manipulation implying there's a possibility to reconcile if you give her money (hint: there is not).", "NTA.

You cannot make someone pay for a mistake forever (well, i guess you can, but that makes you the shitty person after a point). \n\nPart of being an adult is realising that your parents are in fact actually just people and that people are complex and therefore someone who has been nothing but good to you can have been absolutely awful to someone else. \n\ni think you should try for one more conversation with your daughter and if it doesnt result in anything that looks like it could lead to reconciliation send her like a grand as a parting gift and quietly exit her life. \n\nNTA", "INFO: Did she *say* you wouldn't be invited, or is that an assumption?", "NTA - Don't be just a financier for your daughter.

To give you some perspective my mother cheated on my dad which resulted in their divorce and my mom marrying my stepdad. Now I was 4 so I didn't piece it together until I was much older. It was a bad decision for me and my sister and resulted in a lot of bad things happening. She was miserable but her decisions were reckless and selfish as were yours and probably resulted in at least a lot of upheaval in your daughters life. People who have affairs don't understand that the kids in the situation are left at home with the person being cheated on who is in a horrible mental state. She likely bite the brunt of your ex's anger, grief and general meltdown. She has a right to be angry at you.

This is your fault. Regardless of how your ex was, you still made the decision to cheat that ended her family unit. Knock it off with the ex wasn't the perfect wife crap; there's ways to divorce someone without making a larger mess if you were unhappy. You chose a path that increased conflict around your daughter. \n\nNTA for not paying tho, solely based on the information up front you wouldn't be invited. There's a level of audacity there. If she wants to cut you out, she needs to cut you out. She can't keep toeing the dad line when it benefits her.", "INFO: you said your wife was emotionally abusive.

It is possible this is 100% about punishment/money to your daughter and you are fully NTA.\n\nIt is also possible this is about her feeling insecure/rejected/testing your love for her constantly. \n\nEither way, you shouldn't pay money for a wedding you aren't even invited to, BUT, I would suggest telling your daughter you love her and tell her you are willing to pay for therapy for the 2 of you to see if you can repair the relationship as adults. She may not go for it, but it is better to offer it up and let her know you are willing put in emotional work to fix the relationship than let her completely slide away w/o the offer.", "Nta not contributing.

Like dude get a grip", "NAH.\n\nYou aren't the AH for not wanting to be an atm machine, but I don't think your daughter is an ah for not wanting a close relationship with you and just wanting you to pay, since from her point of view, you probably deserve it for cheating.", "So you make a choice which hurts others then get mad when your hurt child doesn't want the man who probably gave her issues at her wedding. Phones work two ways don't really seem like you fought for her or to not break a vow. Lol you won't support her wedding like most fathers do because you're butt hurt? When are you gonna grow up? Honestly. Think of that you're the man who broke her family apart and she probably looked at all men as cheaters.i wouldn't want you there either weddings are about loyalty and love regardless of blood. Being a woman who's dad was  just never ready to grow up I can say when a father who's the adult accepts \"I don't wanna see you or no\" regardless is you kept your ringer on and door open you didn't fight for your marriage or your daughter so after you ruined the her next lesson is dad gives up. Loser", "[removed]", "I'm a bit surprised by everyone opinion.  Youre not really entitled to offer your money but it would be best if you made a bargain.

You want to at least be invited if not hand her off, you want to see her more, text, or call more, and you want to meet her partner.   If she says no, be understanding but leave the situation.  She's allowed to not like you.  What you did was horrible to her mother and your wife. Cheating is not acceptable.

Try wording it like this.  \n\nOf course my daughter doesn't accept the divorce.  My ex wasn't the best wife but she was the perfect mother in my daughter eyes\n\nThat's how your daughter sees it and that's why she's hurt.

The only wrong thing done in your eyes is that you cheated. \n\nWhere you are wrong is yes cheating, and you are saying that the only thing you did wrong is you cheated. My bet is that you were also not the perfect husband not even close. But you put the whole blame on your wife. If your wife was so abusive, she would have been abusive to her and you left her to suffer this. Which I highly doubt. Because any parent would do anything to protect their children.\n\nYou commented on how you tried your best to be in your daughter\u2019s life. Which interpretation says a little here and there but enough for her to stop caring because you abandoned her. You say that you were involved as much as she would let you. That is your excuse. I tell you, I would show up for all of her events and moments. I would call her each week and offer her time with you. My bet is you just waited for the phone to ring.

You took the easy way out.\n\nYou mentioned periodically you reached out to keep the doors open. Which could mean once a year or about every two years or more. You failed as a dad. You don\u2019t have to give her money and not still suck as a dad.\n\nNow you want to remove her from your will. Please do, as this will reinforce her to know that she never mattered to you but as an obligation. \n\nIf it was me, in your shoes, though I could never be in your shoes because I wouldn\u2019t have done what you did, I would gift her money and say that I hope you have a wonderful and successful marriage.

He also didn't rewrite history? He didn't try to paint himself as a prince. Do you lack reading comprehension or even the ability to read? He literally says he knows he was wrong. He regrets how it went down, and in hindsight, he'd have done differently. He would have ended the relationship first. Also, it seems it was more than just thinking with his dick. Not that it excuses cheating, but people in emotionally abusive relationships often cheat when shown kindness and love from outside the emotionally abusive relationship. Getting that validation that you're worthy of love or having that need met somewhere else leads to poor decisions resulting in an affair. It's still not okay, but it's not just about getting his dick wet. And sometimes, because of emotional abuse, the victims feel they cant leave because they are made to believe they are not worthy of love and no one else will want them, love them. Even though it's not the right thing to do, the affair/outside relationship is the catalyst to realizing that they are worthy of love and that they do deserve and can/will be treated better by someone else. And the victim, in hindsight, usually realizes they fucked up and should have ended the relationship before. They regret how it went down, but in truth, for many of them without that other person to show them, they deserve better and that relationships can be loving, they probably would have never left and spent their whole lives miserable and abused. He fully admits he was also wrong. And never once blamed her (the daughter) for anything, and just stated the of her cutting him out of her life. Unfortunately, that's usually how that goes. The abuser gets cheated on, and the victim gets all the blame for the marriage ending, and the abuser's sins are dismissed because somehow cheating is worse than abusing your partner.", "I'm not sure what this has to do with the question at hand?

But you don't get to suck ppls money when you refuse to have any kind of relationship with them.", "Yes he did. He said he shouldn\u2019t have done it and if he had it to do over, he\u2019d do it differently", "At the age of 29 she should have already figured out that everyone is not perfect!  People do things they regret when they are hurting.  She has taken advantage of the situation.  He is NTA, in my opinion, divorce or not.", "Not necessarily.  The cheating was enough to do that kind of damage and he did own it. But either way she isn't entitled to his money regardless.", "Because what happened in the past could be still happening and/or could explain what's happening with the wedding.\n\n Daughter's actions are too weird (expecting him to pay AND to accept to not be invited? And even getting mad because he's refusing? This is beyond entitlement) to not think she can be brainwashed.\n\nRegardless the wedding, I think a decent parent would want to know if his daughter has been brainwashed and if she needs help and therapy. He had needed it and he was an adult man supposedly grown up in a healthy environment and only esposed to the abuse when he was an adult. His daughter has been exposed to the same harmful person during child and teenagehood and with the plus of a highly stressful situation like a divorce", "No, the dude screwed up his relationship with his daughter by cheating on her mom.... that's a pretty normal reason to have an issue with a parent. It doesn't sound like he put in much legwork to repair it. Visitation ain't the same as sitting down and talking with her\n\nIf you are unhappy, divorce before you hook up with someone else. That's pretty freaking simple.", "It\u2019s not that weird\u2026she wants her mom at her wedding as well as not having weird tension and a reminder of an unfaithful union. Having her mom and her peace is more important than having her dad there which would be a headache. Sometimes we have to swallow our pride to get anywhere. But OP doesn\u2019t seem to really care that much. He\u2019s playing victim.

Nobody is obligated to forgive us for our bad choices.", "I think if she tries to invite him after he says no he needs to still say No cause then she\u2019s only inviting him for the cash and doesn\u2019t really want a relationship with him or can tell him later he\u2019s not invited etc", "This. OP's daughter doesn't see him as her dad, she sees him as her wallet. Guarantee she's going to keep trying to emotionally manipulate and gaslight him into giving her money for a (albeit very large) mistake he made.", "Going into counseling with abusers usually makes it much, much worse because it gives them more ammunition and insight to manipulate you with.", "Right but that doesn't make him as bad or worse than an abuser. Also counselling with an abuser sounds like a horrible idea and you'd probably get gaslit into thinking you don't need it and you're the problem if you even tried to get them to do it.", "AITA to a woman who\u2019s been emotionally abused: \u201cLeave him yesterday!

Cheating might not be good but I don\u2019t consider it necessarily wrong when it\u2019s cheating on an abuser", "Are you serious? Abusers can make themselves look good in front of other people, especially a counselor. Go to an appointment, fake it, then go home and still hurt their partner. \ud83d\ude14 As for divorce it's not always that easy when an abuser makes someone feel so bad that they feel like they have nowhere else to go. Everyone here knows cheating is not good, but let's not act like it's worse than *abuse*. Besides that's not the judgement OP is looking for. It's about paying for the wedding. \n\nNTA. OP, If you're not getting an invite then you shouldn't drop even a cent on that wedding. That's not fair to you. If they need more money to fund what they're looking for then they should make it a long engagement and save some money.", "It's almost as if victims of abuse don't always make the best decisions...", "Never attend counselling with an abuser and never advise someone to do so. It's dangerous", "This is a clear example of a story that would get very different responses if the genders were reversed.\n\nObviously cheating isn\u2019t okay but it\u2019s not comparable to abuse. It\u2019s also well documented that victims of abuse can find that they need the boost / support of a new partner to push them to make a change.", "If your judgement of him is that low due to his background as a cheater, then maybe you're not impartial enough to provide a fair judgement on this post.\n\nI don't condone cheating but come on, it's excessive to say he's worse than his abusive ex for cheating. And you need to have at least a little bit of faith in what the OP says as it's the only account we get.", "I agree he doesn\u2019t owe her anything for the wedding. But remember we\u2019re only hearing his side we don\u2019t know what \u201creally\u201c happened. He only paid because he had to legally. But again I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more to the story than what he\u2019s saying. If he was such a great dad she wouldn\u2019t have cut him off.", "Cheaters always say that. They always justify it by saying oh well if I had known\u2026 I always say that when I screw up on something. The big saying is if I had known then what I know now things would be different. He knew cheating was wrong but he did it anyway and he blamed his ex and that\u2019s even worse. I would love to hear their side.", "He cheated so he did not on it until later. Again it\u2019s easier said down the road yeah I should\u2019ve done this but he didn\u2019t. So that\u2019s not owning it.\n\nAgain I agree he doesn\u2019t owe her anything for her wedding. She has chosen to go no contact and that\u2019s on her. But also I believe there\u2019s more to the story than what he\u2019s telling us", "That's all well and good. Awkwardness would suck at the wedding between her parents. But then she shouldn't treat OP as an ATM and think he'll support her wedding like a doormat.", "I cringe when I see people say \"go to a couple's therapist!! that will solve everything!\" when one partner is abusive.  \n\nThey just learn new skills, wrapped nicely in therapy-speak, to abuse you with.", "Ding ding ding ding \n\nThis is precisely right. \n\nNEVER go into counseling with an abuser.", "Ooof\u2026 Things I\u2019d wished I\u2019d known sooner.", "Honestly. I think we all know if op was a women all the comments would be saying how she was right to cheat and daughter needs to get over it, etc, etc.", "There's people here wanting context from the wife and daughter, asking that they read this and share their opinions while completely ignoring the fact that OP has stated hes tried to keep communicating. But he's expected to pay for an event hes not even invited to...?\n\nThat would NEVER happen if the genders were reversed. The misandry and hypocrisy in these subs are starting to become sickening", "I tried to leave my ex so many times. Every time I did, by the end I was begging him to stay.  I finally decided maybe if I cheat he will finally let me leave.", "My exact thought process when I read these types of posts. OP is NTA for the questions posed, but the hivemind is going to call him T A because he cheated on his abuser. Which he is for that I guess, but thats background info and not the question he asked...\n\nFlip the genders and it'd be \"female empowerment, how dare the daughter and husband continue the abuse and demand she pay with no invite\"\n\nI say this as the eldest of 3 sons of a gay man. My mom and dad were married for 10 years, my dad cheated with a man. Now i have an awesome step-sister and the blended families actually enjoy each other's company \n\nThe Y T A comments are wild", "From growing up with divorced parents, I cannot tell you the amount of shit one parents is going to tell about the other, more often fake than true. Even my grandparents were calling my dad new gf a whore, when he never cheated. I've heard the most insane stuffs on both of them Wich some I perfectly knew were fake. Trust me he could've been an okay dad, the worst dad or dad of the year that it could've happen just the same with the daughter.", "Yeah that\u2019s not true. My husband was a great dad, mom was bitter and did everything she could to interfere in their relationship. Happens all the time.", "If he only paid because he had to legally he would have paid child support and that's it.\n\nAlso, her cutting him off doesn't mean he's not a great/good dad, parental alienation is a thing that exists after all.", "I'm gunna give you an example of how this happens - not saying it's the case here I'm just giving you an example. \n\nMy ex husband was emotionally and psychologically abusive to my son and I and financially abusive of me. During our marriage my son had a lot of issues with dad (the abuse) but when we split up my ex turned him against me. He continually lied to my son (who was actually from a previous relationship so not even his blood relative) to make me seem like the bad guy. He told me *in front of my son* that I was still his wife and didn't need boundaries. \n\nHe kept telling my son it was my fault we couldn't work it out and he was \"trying his best\". He told my son if we lived where we do (where I know people) instead of a town 20 minutes away he wouldn't be able to see them as much, while at the same time NEVER asking me to see them and turning down extra days offered. \n\nMy son literally hated me for months, until my ex finally slipped up and my son realised he hadn't really changed. \n\nIt definitely happens. And it's ridiculous how much they can continue to get away with. My ex told my middle/his oldest son I used to hit him, I have a video of my son telling me he knows I used to hit dad cause dad told him. It still wasn't enough to adapt our court order.", "He did own it. Owning it means admitting to it and he did. Just like with anything you do.", "When you\u2019re a parent, you influence SO much in your kid\u2019s life. And as the adult, you have to be the one to think long term. Teens are shortsighted, impulsive and very emotional. The cheating didn\u2019t just disrespect the mother. My dad cheated on my mom and for me it felt like he didn\u2019t love us enough to have that discipline. He didn\u2019t care how it would affect me and my brother. It shattered my trust in men and I\u2019ve just learned to be more rational about it. OP needed to suck it up and actively try his hardest, instead of simply accepting she was avoiding him. It was on him to think of the future and allow her to be upset but still make himself something more than a paycheck. He let his pride keep him from pursuing a more fulfilling relationship. And he\u2019s still making things about himself. He has a chance to have a better relationship by taking an L right now. But he\u2019d rather go nuclear.", "I can totally understand. I had a friend whose partner was emotionally abusive, and even raped her. One day she met a guy who was head over heels for her, and while she did cheat, she wasn\u2019t able to admit how abusive her first partner was until the person she cheated with showed her what love was supposed to be like. I never blamed her for it, I understood why it all happened", "NGL I'd put cheating on your opposite sex partner because you're gay as much worse than cheating on your abuser. In that situation the person being cheated on is still betrayed by the person who they loved and thought loved them.", "And you know he was a great dad? Why would she cut him off if he was such a great dad? He only did what he legally had to do. That\u2019s not a great dad. There\u2019s two sides to every story and she probably had a good reason. That being said however she has no right to ask him for money to a wedding that he\u2019s not even invited to. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reason for that also. Extended family is going to be there and they all know what he did. And I bet they\u2019re still not happy with him about it. So yes she had no right to ask for money and he had every right to decline it. However the fact that she said that to him means that there\u2019s much more going on than what he\u2019s saying", "That\u2019s pretty much what he said. He may have contributed to a sport or two but doesn\u2019t sound like he did any more than that.\n\nAgain I think there\u2019s much more to the story and why she cut him off. He humiliated the family by cheating and I know how that cuts deep it did for me as a child. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more than just the cheating. He\u2019s blaming his ex for all his issues but he was an active participant in that too.\n\nI would love to hear the daughter side and the mother side. I\u2019ll bet the story is quite a bit different. Maybe this guy should show this post to them and see what they have to say.", "Oh I\u2019m sure this happens all the time. More often than not. There\u2019s two sides to every story. That is why I said I would like to hear the other side also from their perspective but I know that will never happen.\n\nThere\u2019s still no excuse for cheating. You get a divorce and move on with your life because cheating brings a new element into the divorce with hurt feelings for all involved.\n\nI\u2019m just saying that he\u2019s trying to make himself out to be a good dad the best guy etc. and I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t. Blaming the ex as he even admitted for the cheating makes it worse.\n\nBut she still has no right to ask him for money.", "You said if he was such a great dad she wouldn\u2019t have cut him off, all I\u2019m saying is that, that isn\u2019t necessarily true. It could be but it also sounds like she\u2019s a pretty entitled brat. Who asks someone to pay for something and then doesn\u2019t invite them. At the very least it\u2019s bad manners. If you want nothing to do with me, you want nothing to do with my money", "Parents often use their children as weapons against the other. Spouse could be a great dad but mom gets angry and keeps the child away to punish him. And both sides do this - I only used great dad, cause that is what the poster above you said about their husband.", "He literally says he paid child support, and then contributed extra on top to cover her extracurricular activities", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an entitled brat. If she wasn\u2019t going to invite him she should\u2019ve never asked him for money. But again I don\u2019t think he was that good of a dad and I think there\u2019s more to the story than this.\n\nI think she was just talking to him and asked if he would contribute to the wedding she is his daughter by the way and if he was such a great dad he would\u2019ve said if I come to the wedding as a guest I\u2019ll bring a gift.\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of bad blood here. Maybe she was testing him. She was wrong to ask for money for something he was not invited to but I think again there is more to the story. We\u2019ll never know"]}
