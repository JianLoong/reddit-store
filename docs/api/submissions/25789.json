I was an involved dad when she was young and we were close. But when she was in her teens I cheated on her mother. My daughter didn\u2019t accept the divorce well. What she didn\u2019t and still doesn\u2019t understand is while her mother might be the best mother in her eyes, my ex wasn\u2019t the perfect wife. I\u2019m not saying what I did was right and I\u2019m not trying to wiggle out of accepting responsibility for my decision to cheat. If I had a chance to do things differently I would\u2019ve divorced her mother first. It took me years of counselling to get over PTSD from my ex wife\u2019s emotionally abusive behaviour. I tried my best to stay in my daughter\u2019s life but since she was old enough to decide, court couldn\u2019t enforce visitation. I paid child support and extra on top for extra curriculars. I was involved in her life as much as she would let me. Periodically I would reach out and kept the door open. We catch up once in a while. \n\nNow, last catch up she tells me she\u2019s getting married. I know of him but I\u2019ve never been introduced to her fianc\u00e9.

I told her I would think about it and she said I suck as a dad if I don\u2019t support her. AITA for not forking out for the wedding?

I do blame her for saying that you \"suck as a dad if \\[you\\] don\u2019t support her.\" That's just trying to take advantage of you, it's empty manipulation implying there's a possibility to reconcile if you give her money (hint: there is not).", "NTA.

You cannot make someone pay for a mistake forever (well, i guess you can, but that makes you the shitty person after a point). \n\nPart of being an adult is realising that your parents are in fact actually just people and that people are complex and therefore someone who has been nothing but good to you can have been absolutely awful to someone else. \n\ni think you should try for one more conversation with your daughter and if it doesnt result in anything that looks like it could lead to reconciliation send her like a grand as a parting gift and quietly exit her life. \n\nNTA", "INFO: Did she *say* you wouldn't be invited, or is that an assumption?", "NTA - Don't be just a financier for your daughter.

To give you some perspective my mother cheated on my dad which resulted in their divorce and my mom marrying my stepdad. Now I was 4 so I didn't piece it together until I was much older. It was a bad decision for me and my sister and resulted in a lot of bad things happening. She was miserable but her decisions were reckless and selfish as were yours and probably resulted in at least a lot of upheaval in your daughters life. People who have affairs don't understand that the kids in the situation are left at home with the person being cheated on who is in a horrible mental state. She likely bite the brunt of your ex's anger, grief and general meltdown. She has a right to be angry at you.

This is your fault. Regardless of how your ex was, you still made the decision to cheat that ended her family unit. Knock it off with the ex wasn't the perfect wife crap; there's ways to divorce someone without making a larger mess if you were unhappy. You chose a path that increased conflict around your daughter. \n\nNTA for not paying tho, solely based on the information up front you wouldn't be invited. There's a level of audacity there. If she wants to cut you out, she needs to cut you out. She can't keep toeing the dad line when it benefits her.", "INFO: you said your wife was emotionally abusive.

It is possible this is 100% about punishment/money to your daughter and you are fully NTA.\n\nIt is also possible this is about her feeling insecure/rejected/testing your love for her constantly. \n\nEither way, you shouldn't pay money for a wedding you aren't even invited to, BUT, I would suggest telling your daughter you love her and tell her you are willing to pay for therapy for the 2 of you to see if you can repair the relationship as adults. She may not go for it, but it is better to offer it up and let her know you are willing put in emotional work to fix the relationship than let her completely slide away w/o the offer.", "Nta not contributing.

Like dude get a grip", "NAH.\n\nYou aren't the AH for not wanting to be an atm machine, but I don't think your daughter is an ah for not wanting a close relationship with you and just wanting you to pay, since from her point of view, you probably deserve it for cheating.", "So you make a choice which hurts others then get mad when your hurt child doesn't want the man who probably gave her issues at her wedding. Phones work two ways don't really seem like you fought for her or to not break a vow. Lol you won't support her wedding like most fathers do because you're butt hurt? When are you gonna grow up? Honestly. Think of that you're the man who broke her family apart and she probably looked at all men as cheaters.i wouldn't want you there either weddings are about loyalty and love regardless of blood. Being a woman who's dad was  just never ready to grow up I can say when a father who's the adult accepts \"I don't wanna see you or no\" regardless is you kept your ringer on and door open you didn't fight for your marriage or your daughter so after you ruined the her next lesson is dad gives up. Loser", "[removed]", "I'm a bit surprised by everyone opinion.  Youre not really entitled to offer your money but it would be best if you made a bargain.

You want to at least be invited if not hand her off, you want to see her more, text, or call more, and you want to meet her partner.   If she says no, be understanding but leave the situation.  She's allowed to not like you.  What you did was horrible to her mother and your wife. Cheating is not acceptable.

Try wording it like this.  \n\nOf course my daughter doesn't accept the divorce.  My ex wasn't the best wife but she was the perfect mother in my daughter eyes\n\nThat's how your daughter sees it and that's why she's hurt.

The only wrong thing done in your eyes is that you cheated. \n\nWhere you are wrong is yes cheating, and you are saying that the only thing you did wrong is you cheated. My bet is that you were also not the perfect husband not even close. But you put the whole blame on your wife. If your wife was so abusive, she would have been abusive to her and you left her to suffer this. Which I highly doubt. Because any parent would do anything to protect their children.\n\nYou commented on how you tried your best to be in your daughter\u2019s life. Which interpretation says a little here and there but enough for her to stop caring because you abandoned her. You say that you were involved as much as she would let you. That is your excuse. I tell you, I would show up for all of her events and moments. I would call her each week and offer her time with you. My bet is you just waited for the phone to ring.

You took the easy way out.\n\nYou mentioned periodically you reached out to keep the doors open. Which could mean once a year or about every two years or more. You failed as a dad. You don\u2019t have to give her money and not still suck as a dad.\n\nNow you want to remove her from your will. Please do, as this will reinforce her to know that she never mattered to you but as an obligation. \n\nIf it was me, in your shoes, though I could never be in your shoes because I wouldn\u2019t have done what you did, I would gift her money and say that I hope you have a wonderful and successful marriage.

He also didn't rewrite history? He didn't try to paint himself as a prince. Do you lack reading comprehension or even the ability to read? He literally says he knows he was wrong. He regrets how it went down, and in hindsight, he'd have done differently. He would have ended the relationship first. Also, it seems it was more than just thinking with his dick. Not that it excuses cheating, but people in emotionally abusive relationships often cheat when shown kindness and love from outside the emotionally abusive relationship. Getting that validation that you're worthy of love or having that need met somewhere else leads to poor decisions resulting in an affair. It's still not okay, but it's not just about getting his dick wet. And sometimes, because of emotional abuse, the victims feel they cant leave because they are made to believe they are not worthy of love and no one else will want them, love them. Even though it's not the right thing to do, the affair/outside relationship is the catalyst to realizing that they are worthy of love and that they do deserve and can/will be treated better by someone else. And the victim, in hindsight, usually realizes they fucked up and should have ended the relationship before. They regret how it went down, but in truth, for many of them without that other person to show them, they deserve better and that relationships can be loving, they probably would have never left and spent their whole lives miserable and abused. He fully admits he was also wrong. And never once blamed her (the daughter) for anything, and just stated the of her cutting him out of her life. Unfortunately, that's usually how that goes. The abuser gets cheated on, and the victim gets all the blame for the marriage ending, and the abuser's sins are dismissed because somehow cheating is worse than abusing your partner.", "I'm not sure what this has to do with the question at hand?
