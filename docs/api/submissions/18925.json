The cold hard fact is, parent management training for the\u200b\u200b parents of ODD is the main treatment for oppositional behaviors, so simply putting him therapy will likely never change the behavior. \n\nYou also say they \"are often at their wits end with my brother but they still allow him to live with them and to not work or do chores\", which indicates PMT was not attempted or the parents did not master it. \n\nThis might be the first or one of the few times they've experienced consequences for continuing to enable his behavior. Do not allow them to guilt trip you into remaining involved in this toxic situation. NTA.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to be your own person and create boundaries with your family. i hope that the holidays go well for you and that you find comfort in your independence.", "NTA - you are an adult and can choose to visit or not visit your parents as you want. It absolutely sounds like a situation where going low contact is better for your wellbeing, good for you for determining that, and beat of luck in your studies!", "NTA - welcome to adulthood. Just say that you're taking a job for the summer, maybe some extra classes to get ahead, so that topic is closed. Nothing to do with your brother, but as you've made it clear when you do come for Christmas you will feel more comfortable in a hotel. You're an adult now, you are paying your way through college and presumably for the rest of your life. That's it.", "NAH Of course you don't want to go back, who could blame you? I'm sure your parents understand deep down, you are a bright light in their awful world and they were caught off guard. Give them time, they'll probably come round. It's not your fault.", "NTA. You\u2019re an independent adult and it sounds like your parents are probably enabling your brother by allowing him to live at home and not experience the consequences of his actions. But, that is no longer your problem. \n\nI imagine the consequences of his actions will be prison eventually, and I wonder if then your parents might sit back and wonder if they put all their eggs into the wrong basket. I think you are doing a great thing by making it extremely clear now that no matter what happens to your brother or parents, you won\u2019t be taking care of him. \n\nMy advice would be for you to maintain your boundary in a cheerful, positive, disengaged and confident way.\n\n \u2018Sorry mum, I won\u2019t be able to come back for that long, but I\u2019ll be back for a week staying at x hotel and would love to spend some time with you then. What would you like to do together?\u2019 \n\nIf the response is, \u2018But you need to come back for the whole summer! This is so selfish and childish!\u2019, then you say, \u2018Oh mum, I just explained that I\u2019ll be back from x date to x date. What would you like to do together? Do you want to come have lunch at the hotel restaurant, I hear it\u2019s quite good! It has some great reviews!\u2019\n\nSo, In an unemotionally-invested way you just keep stating what you are going to do and redirecting the conversation. \n\nYou don\u2019t buy into the manipulation and become angry, you stay cheerfully disengaged. Sort of like you\u2019re talking to a child.", "NTA\nStaying 3 months in that environment sounds bad for your mental health. Your plan to visiting for Christmas and staying in hotel for a week sounds perfect. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into doing what you think is right", "NTA.  I was in a similar situation going to college.  Except I was the one being abused.   College was the smartest way to obtain a \"get out of hell\" card.\n\nI loved my college life compared to hell home.  I never stayed longer than two days when I visited.  Believe me, once you're out of that environment, going back is hell.  Especially if  *nothing*  changes for the better. \n\nI spent the rest of my visit with my bff and her family!", "NTA", "NTA. Who in their right mind would want to go home to that situation? But, as a parent, I understand why they\u2019re upset and disappointed. They love you, they miss you and they enjoy having you around.

You're in independent adult, paying for your own life and nobody gets to demand that you put yourself back into a toxic, harmful situation. Visit for Christmas sure, but on your terms. Then I suggest you spend your summer travelling, or getting a summer job to save up some more cash.", "NTA.  You are an adult now.  Make your own decision where to spend your time.", "NTA. You have no obligation to go back, and you've already made the compromise that you'll go back for Christmas. You're an adult and they can't force you to spend your whole summer in their home dealing with the chaos and drama. If you don't already have a part time job, maybe see if you can get some work over the holidays - work is always my excuse for not being able to go back to my family for more than a couple of days at a time - it will give you an out that they may respect more than a flat out \"no\", and it's always nice to have a bit of extra cash.

You do not need to expose yourself to your brother's destructiveness. Your parents will just have to come to grips with that.", "NTA\n\nIs your brother a legal adult?  If he is not, then that explains a lot about your parents and why he is there. Your parents' behaviour is probably enabling your brother. I will explain later.\n\nHowever, if he is an adult, they are enabling him.  It is so difficult as a parent to do the right thing, when you feel like it will cause your child pain (mental or physical). With a disorder of any kind it is hard to become a better person if not impossible.  \n\nPlus with most societies and cultures, it is very hard to get them the help that they need.\n\n>My brother has oppositional defiant disorder and growing up with him was a nightmare. He had to be removed from school and my mum had to homeschool him because of his behaviour.\n\nHe did not have to be removed from school. If he was officially diagnosed, he would have had an educational plan in place to help him function at school. I am willing to bet that your parents did not like the plan and chose to homeschool him.\n\nYour parents are probably feeling like they are losing you as well as everyone else in their life. \n\nThe boundaries you are setting are good.  Do not change them for your parents. They need to see that you are steadfast in them. Ultimately, they will make their own decisions based on this, for better or worse.", "NTA. I feel for your parents because your brother\u2019s condition has basically ruined their lives, they are worn down, they have spent years in crisis management mode, and you are probably the only glimpse of anything like the family they envisioned when y\u2019all were babies. But your well-being is your top priority, you\u2019re finally in a healthy space, and you deserve to choose to stay away from the situation at home.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground. Your happy escape to uni changed the family dynamics. \n\nYour parents want you back as the buffer. Maybe your parents were hoping to make you watch your brother while they take a vacation?\n\nBe sure to keep your car keys, valuables, plane tickets, digital devices and ID on your person whenever you visit. And yes, staying in a rented space is best if you visit.", "Your parents are obviously enabling his behavior which is why it isn\u2019t getting better. You are not the sacrificial lamb here. Enjoy your life, and newfound freedom from stress. NTA.", "They've lost all their friends, neighbors won't even come over, and even the grandparents have trouble being there... It sounds like they've actually had lots of consequences for enabling him, but none of them have mattered - or mattered enough. \n\nMaybe OP staying away will matter enough, maybe when OP isn't there to take some of the load they'll finally start to try, but either way, yeah, OP is best off staying away.", "Does ODD in adults become anti-social personality disorder?", "Yes. Mostly if unresolved during childhood the person does end up with a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder as an adult. However, many things can get in the way of ending up with that diagnosis. Sometimes the person doesn't follow up with treatment as an adult, or it takes new providers a while to arrive at that diagnosis because the person isn't honest about what's going on. As an adult they don't usually have parents going with them to treatment providers and sometimes their spouses know there are problems, they just don't how to describe it a way makes sense, especially since the anti-social person often gaslights them to oblivion.", "Those consequences don't cost them anything but money.  When they lose a child, they care about, maybe.\n\nI doubt they care about the OP, as she has had to give up everything for her brother.", "No it is still ODD in adults. I have a cousin with it. They can manage better if they have been in therapy and been trained to understand that their actions have consequences.", "It's generally frowned upon to diagnose children with antisocial personality disorder, and oppositional defiance disorder is only a childhood disorder. However, many children with ODD grow up to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, yes. At least, from what I remember from my recent psychology classes.", "NTA", "As someone who moved out of the family home 19 years ago and never went back: you won\u2019t regret staying away. NTA, your life sounds amazing now and you have every right to cherish it!", "Nta. I'm glad that you get to have your own life now.  Take the time and peace that distance offers and find out what you want and who you are. \n\nLikely,  they are upset because this is the first time that you have pushed back against them. You've all been trying to keep your brother's boat from sinking, they are used to you not rocking the boat. Now you are rocking the boat by getting out and they don't know how to compensate.", "Initial thoughts based only on the title:  only if you actually are coming home for the summer and you told them you're not to throw them off the scent.  I mean, if you're not coming home for the summer it sure makes sense to tell them.  \n\n\nAfter actually reading: Ah, this isn't actually about whether or not to tell  your parents, it's about not liking being around your brother.  NTA.  Your brother sounds awful. If he's as bad as you describe I wouldn't even be going over for Christmas and whatnot, I'd be inviting the parents out for dinner without him.", "Nta live your life", "NTA", "NTA, you're doing the right thing. Don't feel bad.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult now and independent. Don't let them guilt you to be ashamed of that.", "Great advice!", "NTA. They are mad because with you there I guess the can leave the house and get time out from him, but these are consequences of their choices, if as you said they enabled his behavior, I can understand that they are probably tired of fighting and the situation but leaving as it is is not feasible for anybody, if he's an adult and functional he'll have to learn to survive on his own, is harsh but you don't deserve to lose your life for the sake of enabling your brother.", "NTA, you are now an independent adult. It seems like they are angry with you, not because you dont want to stay with them, but because you are free of having to deal with your brother, while they still have to and have no support network or friends. I don't know anything about ODD, but it sounds like they are not handling this well at all and have never handled this well. Also, while off topic, have they ever thought about what happens to your brother in the future when they can no longer look after him, my guess would be no. OP i would say for your sanity, LC is the way to go ornat the least always stay at a.hotel when you visit.", "NTA, let them be upset. Your life has been negatively affected by your brother for too long,  time for you to enjoy yourself now.", "NTA, stay strong and do what's best for YOU, as your parents are unwilling or unable to. Sorry you had to grow up in this situation, and I am glad you got out.", "Tell them why, is my advice. This is a reasonable boundary. Do not budge. Then i think you will feel better. Also because they need to take some accountability for your protection from his sht. And it sounds like they haven't really. NTA", "I don't know how realistic it is but maybe consider asking one of your grandparents if you are able to stay with them for a bit. Would give you a chance to develop a closer relationship with them independent of your parents and brother and would be cheaper than staying in a hotel over Christmas which would make it possible to stay there longer.\nIf they also struggle with your brother they will probably understand you not wanting to be around him full time", "NTA,  you have your own life to live and should be spending your summer preparing for your next term and earning you money for books and expenses .   But remember one thing,  even though it's not your fault, this is just adding to your parents' sense of abandonment by everyone.   They are probably even thinking that you will be helping them through the summer which you are not obligated to do.  Perhaps you can find a few days to visit and then make a break for it.", "NTA. You deserve a chance to thrive outside the sphere of your brother\u2019s destruction. Do what you need to protect your mental health. You don\u2019t owe your parents anything", "Hey, setting boundaries and protecting  yourself often doesn\u2019t feel good at first. It\u2019s time for you to live your life.", "Your parents had a secret plan for you to take care of your brother. You not returning, is the first hint of reality that has caused them to realise their secret plan is not going to happen and they are stuck with him. That is why they are so upset. Every other personal relationship has been sacrificed to your brother needs, you\u2019re the last one. NTA", "NTA. It is reasonable to want nothing to do with your brother; he is not your responsibility. Unfortunately, your parents consider him theirs, so maintaining a relationship in the circumstances will be taxing. I can understand why they are upset but you do need to have appropriate boundaries regarding your brother.", "NTA Protect yourself and live your life.", "NTA. It sounds like you could benefit from therapy or counseling to help navigate your parents attempt to guilt you. You have a right to your own life and to find your own happiness. Don't give it up because of a guilt trip.", "NTA \n\nYou are free to live your own life. Let your parents be mad but you don\u2019t want to deal with your brother that\u2019s your right.

Don\u2019t allow them to guilt trip remember you don\u2019t have childhood friends because of your family don\u2019t let them rob you of having adult friends and a social life too. Your number one priority is you! Your mental health matters, your wellbeing matters.", "NTA, and I notice you don't mention anything about how much your parents miss seeing you, only that they're at their wit's end. It sounds more like they're angry for losing out on your help rather than genuinely wanting to see their daughter. Stay away guilt free.", "NTA. Even if your brother wasn't there, you're not obligated to visit", "NTA. Stay firm for your own sanity.", "nta ... they should have gotten professional help for him and they didnt they are enabling his behaviour its borderline child abuse on their part not only for you but for your brother he clearly struggles to process things and they are refusing to help him they are sabotaging his future aswell as yours", "NTA \n\nI feel sorry for your parents, but not enough to fault you for your getting out and staying away.", "Nah. It's not a bad thing you aren't coming home. But they are allowed to be sad to", "NTA.  My gut says parents are mad that you are not coming home because they were looking for you to help \"manage\" the sibling while home to give them a break.", "NTA. You need to protect yourself now and not let your life be ruined as theirs is.

They will resist, may say things like \u201cdon\u2019t come at all\u201d, etc, as they process this latest grief. It\u2019s not your responsibility to manage their reactions to your life choices, just give them a chance to adjust.", "> If the response is, \u2018But you need to come back for the whole summer! This is so selfish and childish!\u2019, then you say,\n\n\"I'm not coming at all then.\"", "I imagine OP not wanting to go home is showing them that s/he won't be the carer when they can no longer do so and that may be part of why they are so adamant she comes home.", "I'm not sure what county OP is from so this might not be true.
