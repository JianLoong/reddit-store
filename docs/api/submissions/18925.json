My brother is not disabled. He doesn't require a carer or babysitter. My parents let him live there with them, but if they didn't he could live on his own. There is no reason to expect myself or anyone else to care for him in that way. He causes trouble when faced with authority, but it's not a disability or condition where he can't be on his own like any other adult.**\n\nI'm in university, I'm not even four months into my first year and I'm happier here than I've ever been. I purposely chose a university that was 4000 km away from my family. It's about a five hour flight or a two and half day drive (non-stop) and I would not have it any other way.\n\nMy brother has oppositional defiant disorder and growing up with him was a nightmare. He had to be removed from school and my mum had to homeschool him because of his behaviour. We could never have guests or friends come round to our house, and we couldn't have anything nice or expensive because my brother is so destructive. I grew up without friends because of my brother. My parents lost all their friends and even the neighbours will not have anything to do with my family because of my brother. My grandparents try but they we affected by my brother's behaviour as well. Mum had to give up her job. My brother is a nightmare to be around. He has a problem with any kind of authority or rules and cannot handle not being allowed to do whatever he wants. He is in treatment by professionals but it hasn't solved anything. \n\nI'm not even four months into my first year and I already know I don't want to go back to my parents. I told them I'm not coming back over the summer. I said I will visit for Christmas but I will stay in a hotel instead of their house, and I will avoid my brother as much as possible. They want me to come back and stay with them for the entire summer - from November to January. After getting a taste of what life is like without the nightmare that is my brother I'm never going back as long as he is there.

They are really upset with me for saying I'm not coming home for the summer. They are often at their wits end with my brother but they still allow him to live with them and to not work or do chores. I thought they would understand why I'm not coming back this summer. However they are really upset, especially since it's more than six months away. I've never had them so upset with me before.

If he is not, then that explains a lot about your parents and why he is there. Your parents' behaviour is probably enabling your brother. I will explain later.\n\nHowever, if he is an adult, they are enabling him.  It is so difficult as a parent to do the right thing, when you feel like it will cause your child pain (mental or physical).

Mostly if unresolved during childhood the person does end up with a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder as an adult. However, many things can get in the way of ending up with that diagnosis. Sometimes the person doesn't follow up with treatment as an adult, or it takes new providers a while to arrive at that diagnosis because the person isn't honest about what's going on. As an adult they don't usually have parents going with them to treatment providers and sometimes their spouses know there are problems, they just don't how to describe it a way makes sense, especially since the anti-social person often gaslights them to oblivion.", "Those consequences don't cost them anything but money.  When they lose a child, they care about, maybe.\n\nI doubt they care about the OP, as she has had to give up everything for her brother.", "No it is still ODD in adults. I have a cousin with it. They can manage better if they have been in therapy and been trained to understand that their actions have consequences.", "It's generally frowned upon to diagnose children with antisocial personality disorder, and oppositional defiance disorder is only a childhood disorder.

They know the devastation that has been brought onto the family due to your brother\u2019s issues but the saying is\u201dmisery loves company\u201d.  You stay where you are and have a wonderful life. Your brother needs to be in a facility that can handle him", "My mom was very controlling and I never felt more myself and FREE than I did when I went to college. I was only 2.5 hours away and came home for all holidays and random weekends. I was still expected to clean her house, etc. on those weekends even though both brothers were at home and did nothing. \n\nI was in a popular coastal town so I used the excuse that I had jobs and a place to live that I didn't want to give up for the summer. It was true as I paid for college myself. I would have had to compete with the hoards of students returning to a place with extremely high prices and little availability all looking for houses and jobs. Returning home, I would still need a job. As my mom was also practical, she didn't fight me too much because I also took some difficult-to-schedule classes in the summer as well. I got my freedom and stayed away until I graduated. I went back for grad school and got a permanent job there.", "Conduct disorder in children, not ODD, is a precursor to antisocial personality disorder in adults; however ODD can sometimes lead to CD. I wonder if OPs brother actually has conduct disorder. He doesn't mention the brother's age but I'm assuming at least early teens, which is  when CD usually becomes evident.", ">I doubt they care about the OP, as she has had to give up everything for her brother.\n\nShe's probably what they call a \"glass child\"", "More recent scholarship says otherwise. Since ODD is often comorbid with ADHD, OCD, and Autism, it's considered more of a developmental disorder now than a personality one. The consensus right now is that if the parents are trained better to deal with it but professionals, the kid eventually grows out of it. If their home life is unstable or their parents unable to deal with how the kid's brain works it gradually gets worse, which CAN lead to personality disorders as an adult, but it's not guaranteed.", "No. ODD is characterized by an intolerance for being controlled. CD shares this characteristic but is additionally characterized by a need to control others and a profound lack of empathy, especially an indifference to others' suffering or pain. A diagnosis of antisocial personality in adulthood requires evidence for a diagnosis of CD in adolescence.", "If parents properly go through with and stick to PMT, the kid usually grows out of ODD on their own. Parents hate taking responsibility though, and the older generation is stuck on \"some kids are just born to be monsters\" so the kid has all of this bullshit going on and then the go home to the exact same environment. It's pretty hard to get them to progress as an educator if the parents won't get with the program.", "A conversation i had with a therapist once:\nme: yeah so sometime around 12 i realized that i was gonna get screamed regardless of what i did, so i did whatever i wanted to.\ntherapist: so have you ever been diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder? \nme: yeah actually, later that year \ud83e\udd72", "We\u2019re currently workshopping the idea that maybe the anxiety, depression and ocd are just autism, it\u2019s just a slow process because hereditary neurodivergence and acquired neurodivergence have very few distinct symptoms especially when working with chameleon illnesses like bpd and osdd.", "i was medicated for 13 years for bipolar disorder i don\u2019t have so we\u2019re definitely working with an already exhausted muscle lol", "NTA you have to protect yourself because your parents stopped doing that.", "NTA. Congrats on getting away. So happy you are happy. It must be surreal to look back on what you escaped.  You obviously planned for this.

I have no idea whether your parents have contributed to this problem or not, but it's not right of them to act like you don't have a legitimate reason to refuse to go to their home.
