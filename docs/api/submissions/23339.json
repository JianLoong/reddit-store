First part how fast she can,  second part how fast you can and someday, maybe both parts fast.", "NAH. Does she even know this is supposed to be a power walk? You're trying to stay fit, and secretly trying to get her fit, but I don't see any signs that this is *her* goal. Can you do some social walks and some explicitly-for-exercise walks, and tell her which is which?", "Nta just tell her you always walk at a faster pace and then do just that.  Up to her if she wants to keep up with you. She asked to join you on your walks.  You did not ask to join her on a stroll.", "NTA. \n\nYou're both looking for different things. \n\nEither she's not getting what she wants, or you aren't.\n\nIf there's a way to turn that zero-sum game into a win/win, then awesome. If not, you're entitled to your walk.", "NTA. Why not go on two walks?", "NTA\n\nI'm not quite in your age bracket but I know walking with someone who goes faster than me is difficult and slower than me is torture. I'm sure she'll understand if you offer alternative ways for social connection. And who knows? If you introduce her to other people at your community activities, she might meet people who are more her speed than you guys. Win-win!", "NTA - Just be honest. Tell her that you guys aren't walking just to be social and you need to pick up the pace. Let her decide if she wants to try to keep up or bow out.", "NTA. Like someone else said, do your exercise walk and then pick her up for a cool down social walk. It wouldn\u2019t be as long, but it\u2019s something.", "NTA. I've tried walking with people who were too fast. It's not fun.\n\nLet her know you guys can do something else but the walk will be at your usual pace going forward, and you'll not be doing that with her again.", "YTA. Take a warm up walk with her then another one without her. A second walk won\u2019t hurt you but the first will could save her. Emotionally and physically.", "Keep doing your brisk pace walk and find some time to do a gentle meander with her at another time.", "NAH. You are walking for exercise and she cannot keep up. She clearly wants the company and you are willing to include her in other things to give her that social outlet. No assholes here.", "NTA.\n\nYour second last paragraph, very thoughtful and a perfect solution.", "NTA. Just be straightforward \"we love your company but we want to go faster than we have been with you.

Most of us have very busy schedules and scheduling a second slow walk can\u2019t be done.   \n\nI love to help out neighbors and there may be many other ways OP can help out.  For instance having her join in a grocery shopping trip. Having her over for dinner some evening.  The bottom line is the newly widowed neighbor is responsible for finding people and things in her own life that will make her life worth living.", "Perfect answer. NTA though.", "Uhhhh. She said the second was fast. And some people prioritize health and exercise. I have a husband, 4 children, a 60 hr a week job, 3 pets and lots of hobbies and still go to the gym or work out at home for 90+ minutes a day. Because I prioritize. (On the stairmaster now. Checking Reddit l, writing emails etc etc)", "[removed]", "Took a year to be able to not hold on, I started at 10 minutes a morning. 10 years later, 30 minutes a day no hands on a level 7. I get a lot done in those 30 minutes. We will all get old (hopefully) and keeping those movements is so important. We take things like stairs for granted. I also am 40f and squat 315, bench press 185 and deadlift 315. Started 10 years ago. It\u2019s not about the weight. It\u2019s about I want to be 72 one day and not view a second walk as troublesome. Or have to use my hands to get off a toilet. Or be able to push myself up if I fall. (I\u2019m also a S&C coach, CPT and certified nutritionist so I\u2019m biased to doing activity for longevity lol)", "[removed]", "YWBTA if you put it to her that way: \"You can't walk with us anymore.\" Just explain, \"My doctor says I need to walk with my heart rate above X and I can't seem to get it up that high at this pace. Margaret has the same problem. We'll need to pick back up to our usual pace, but we weren't sure if you were quite ready for that since you've just started. What do you want to do? Do you want us to do the faster part, then swing by here and pick you up for the slower cool-down part?\" \n\nI think if she's a sad widow the exercise is really good for her so would be great to keep that aspect going, not just getting together for lunch or something. And she really will get faster if she keeps walking every day.", "NTA, if you want to keep a friendship with this woman, explain things honestly and try to suggest another activity that you guys can do socially. Maybe you guys could even do your normal walk, and then do an extra lap with her socially as a \u201ccooldown\u201d. She will still get to move around a bit, you guys still get the workout and a cool down, and you still get be socially with her.", "NTA. While I'm not quite as old as you are I'm getting there. I also take a couple walks a day but like your neighbor, I can't walk fast enough to consider it cardio. I have a bad knee and hip issues, I'm not walking for cardio or to burn calories, I'm walking to improve the circulation in my lower legs and to keep my joints limber.  I would never expect a walking partner to compromise their own fitness to accomodate my limitations. \n\n>I'm thinking maybe we could invite her to other activities in our community, but it would be more sparse. Not every day.\n\nThat's probably your best compromise.", "Go on your walks together but take a social walk w8th her sometimes. Tell her you need to get your heart rate up for medical reasons.", "I say NAH here and think you have good reasons for not wanting her to be on this particular walk, and I appreciate that you want to remain friendly and find something else to do with her - I agree with others, sit down and talk to her and maybe come up with a way to still see her, whether that be for a cool down portion of the walk or maybe another activity.", "\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90 excellent compromise.", "Retired folks tend to have time. That's the luxury of not working or raising kids: a relatively open schedule.", "NAH. Can you walk a different route and pick her up after the brisk part?", "At 72 , the time for \"People Pleasing\" is over! Do the things you want to do!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is ruining the walks for you.", "NTA you have to do what's right for you. Kindly explain to her that you have to keep a certain pace to make it worthwhile and if she's willing to keep up she's welcome, but otherwise you are walking to walk, not stroll and chat.\n As a compromise you could perhaps instead ask her to join you for coffee, or an after dinner drink at either residence or a nearby restaurant or cafe occasionally. If you simply don't like her company, change up when and where you walk and just be prepared to have to make excuses for it. It sucks to try to do something out of kindness that kinda backfires but life is life and you have to live yours.", "That is a good answer. Sometimes reddit really does well with the crowdsourcing.", "I was going to suggest two daily walks, exercise and chatty, but this is a much more elegant solution! NTA OP, but I'd recommend being gentler than you phrased it here.", "This is such a good way to approach it. It still gives the neighbor some activity and conversation too which seems important to her and the other two still win since they\u2019ve gotten their cardio in", "Why? Because all old people are expected to be sweet grandmothers?\n\nIf they were 22 you wouldn't be offering a cool down compromise.", "A very kind and thoughtful response!", "Yes, actually I would.  It fits the circumstances regardless of the age.", "NTA drop her like it\u2019s hot. She\u2019s not keeping up the pace and is slowing you down. You ain\u2019t no spring chicken. You need that exercise!!!", "Nta -", "NTA\n\nMaybe do a walk with her and a more vigorous walk at another time", "NTA Invite her to activities and talk to her regularly on the phone. She needs social contact.", "Assuming you do a cool down portion of your walk, maybe she could join then - or maybe end the walk at her place for a chat.. maybe she doesnt really want to walk at all?  if you like her company, find a way to make it fit - community is important.", "Excellent idea!", "This is the way. I\u2019m a marathon runner and over the years many beginners have wanted to train with me. I run my miles first and then have them join me for my cool downs. They get support in their new habit. I get company for the boring final mile. Everyone is happy.", "Calm down. Nobody is insulting anyone here, so there's really no need to get offended.\n\nBtw, NTA OP. The comment at the top of this thread was really good advice!", "How often do you go on walks? Could you do some brisk days and some slow days? NAH", "NTA for wanting to go fast. But just as long as you clearly make your case for needing her to go faster (ie negative fx of nothing a proper speed) or you need to find a different activity later in the day/week to do with her that is more her clip. She can take that how she wants.", "NAH, but your comment that she is \u201cvery heavy set\u201d and \u201cthe exercise would do her good,\u201d is pretty gross (and borderline AH). You clearly have no idea what her physical challenges may be or what has causes her state. That said, nothing wrong with using the suggestions shares in these comments.", "NTA but you\u2019d be a an awesome human if you proposed to the widow to go out on walks just with them. You\u2019d get a couple more steps in and she\u2019d get some needed human interaction.", "NTA, but what I would do, is take a social walk with her at some other time during the day.", "I think this is the way! I also love when Redditors come up with something good. You might have to change up your route a little but stopping by and grabbing her for the cool down is such a great suggestion.", "Why lie by saying the \u201cdoctor says\u201d if, in fact, the doctor did not?!", "70 steps per minute. I started it training for the GC as well. We did the entire Bright Angel last year. First year we made it to the 3 mile mark and turned around d."]}
