This is your health!   Your neighbor should find someone in her area that wants to walk at her pace.   This is why my husband and I NEVER walk together.  I end up waiting for him to catch up every few minutes.  \n\nInvite her to coffee once and awhile.", "NTA  but have you told her what you want from this walk and that you are not getting it?\n\nNext step could be to extend the walk with just you two and be open to her about it. First part how fast she can,  second part how fast you can and someday, maybe both parts fast.", "NAH. Does she even know this is supposed to be a power walk? You're trying to stay fit, and secretly trying to get her fit, but I don't see any signs that this is *her* goal. Can you do some social walks and some explicitly-for-exercise walks, and tell her which is which?", "Nta just tell her you always walk at a faster pace and then do just that.  Up to her if she wants to keep up with you. She asked to join you on your walks.  You did not ask to join her on a stroll.", "NTA. \n\nYou're both looking for different things. \n\nEither she's not getting what she wants, or you aren't.\n\nIf there's a way to turn that zero-sum game into a win/win, then awesome. If not, you're entitled to your walk.", "NTA. Why not go on two walks?", "NTA\n\nI'm not quite in your age bracket but I know walking with someone who goes faster than me is difficult and slower than me is torture. I'm sure she'll understand if you offer alternative ways for social connection. And who knows? If you introduce her to other people at your community activities, she might meet people who are more her speed than you guys. Win-win!", "NTA - Just be honest. Tell her that you guys aren't walking just to be social and you need to pick up the pace. Let her decide if she wants to try to keep up or bow out.", "NTA. Like someone else said, do your exercise walk and then pick her up for a cool down social walk. It wouldn\u2019t be as long, but it\u2019s something.", "NTA. I've tried walking with people who were too fast. It's not fun.\n\nLet her know you guys can do something else but the walk will be at your usual pace going forward, and you'll not be doing that with her again.", "YTA. Take a warm up walk with her then another one without her. A second walk won\u2019t hurt you but the first will could save her. Emotionally and physically.", "Keep doing your brisk pace walk and find some time to do a gentle meander with her at another time.", "NAH. You are walking for exercise and she cannot keep up. She clearly wants the company and you are willing to include her in other things to give her that social outlet. No assholes here.", "NTA.\n\nYour second last paragraph, very thoughtful and a perfect solution.", "NTA. Just be straightforward \"we love your company but we want to go faster than we have been with you. But we'd love to have tea or lunch with you later today.\"\n\nShe'll probably appreciate it more than sitting there thinking she's being excluded because people don't like her.", "I think that I am going to keep my opinions to myself!", "NTA. It would be sweet to take a second, social, walk. It wouldn't make any sense for you to have your current walk ruined by someone that thinks 2-3 mile per hour is good enough for your exercise walk.", "NTA  Go on your vigorous walk with your neighbor as usual, then stop by the other neighbor to \"pick her up\" and use that portion as your cool down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most of us have very busy schedules and scheduling a second slow walk can\u2019t be done.   \n\nI love to help out neighbors and there may be many other ways OP can help out.  For instance having her join in a grocery shopping trip. Having her over for dinner some evening.  The bottom line is the newly widowed neighbor is responsible for finding people and things in her own life that will make her life worth living.", "Perfect answer. NTA though.", "Uhhhh. She said the second was fast. And some people prioritize health and exercise. I have a husband, 4 children, a 60 hr a week job, 3 pets and lots of hobbies and still go to the gym or work out at home for 90+ minutes a day. Because I prioritize. (On the stairmaster now. Checking Reddit l, writing emails etc etc)", "Even if I disagree with your verdict props on being able to do all that while on the stairmaster, I can't imagine. Maybe bike, treadmill, or elliptical but I never could on the stairs.", "Took a year to be able to not hold on, I started at 10 minutes a morning. 10 years later, 30 minutes a day no hands on a level 7. I get a lot done in those 30 minutes. We will all get old (hopefully) and keeping those movements is so important. We take things like stairs for granted. I also am 40f and squat 315, bench press 185 and deadlift 315. Started 10 years ago. It\u2019s not about the weight. It\u2019s about I want to be 72 one day and not view a second walk as troublesome. Or have to use my hands to get off a toilet. Or be able to push myself up if I fall. (I\u2019m also a S&C coach, CPT and certified nutritionist so I\u2019m biased to doing activity for longevity lol)", "How many steps a minute is level 7? Sorry that is the only measurement I know and props to you, I can mainly workout outside and find gyms so depressing though I try to do the stairmaster when I train for grand canyon rim to rim. \n\nAlso props to your other accomplishments too! That is amazing", "YWBTA if you put it to her that way: \"You can't walk with us anymore.\" Just explain, \"My doctor says I need to walk with my heart rate above X and I can't seem to get it up that high at this pace. Margaret has the same problem. We'll need to pick back up to our usual pace, but we weren't sure if you were quite ready for that since you've just started. What do you want to do? Do you want us to do the faster part, then swing by here and pick you up for the slower cool-down part?\" \n\nI think if she's a sad widow the exercise is really good for her so would be great to keep that aspect going, not just getting together for lunch or something. And she really will get faster if she keeps walking every day.", "NTA, if you want to keep a friendship with this woman, explain things honestly and try to suggest another activity that you guys can do socially. Maybe you guys could even do your normal walk, and then do an extra lap with her socially as a \u201ccooldown\u201d. She will still get to move around a bit, you guys still get the workout and a cool down, and you still get be socially with her.", "NTA. While I'm not quite as old as you are I'm getting there. I also take a couple walks a day but like your neighbor, I can't walk fast enough to consider it cardio. I have a bad knee and hip issues, I'm not walking for cardio or to burn calories, I'm walking to improve the circulation in my lower legs and to keep my joints limber.  I would never expect a walking partner to compromise their own fitness to accomodate my limitations. \n\n>I'm thinking maybe we could invite her to other activities in our community, but it would be more sparse. Not every day.\n\nThat's probably your best compromise.", "Go on your walks together but take a social walk w8th her sometimes. Tell her you need to get your heart rate up for medical reasons.", "I say NAH here and think you have good reasons for not wanting her to be on this particular walk, and I appreciate that you want to remain friendly and find something else to do with her - I agree with others, sit down and talk to her and maybe come up with a way to still see her, whether that be for a cool down portion of the walk or maybe another activity.", "\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90 excellent compromise.", "Retired folks tend to have time. That's the luxury of not working or raising kids: a relatively open schedule."]}
