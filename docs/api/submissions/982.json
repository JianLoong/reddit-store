I was pissed off not only because I spend my own money on this, but because all of my decorations took about 2 weeks including weekends to put up.  I told her that I would not be doing that because I spent my own money on it and she shouldn't be so nosy. \n\nHere is where I may be the asshole, I went to my principal (\"Lucy\") and reported Mary to her. Lucy and I are friends. Lucy said she would deal with Mary (which I assumed as firing her, but may be something else).

Right? \n\nYour teachers union is so weak that suggesting changing your posters can get a teacher, who presumably has been teaching for many years given her age, fired???? Fired by the principal who is personal friends with the person who complained? \n\nEither this is entirely fabricated or your teachers union is TA for allowing such garbage employment protections.", "NTA and I seriously doubt you letting the principal know about Mary's remarks got her fired even if you are close.", "How do you figure she's going to get fired for that?", "That is 100% not a fireable offense. Especially with a long term teacher.", "Calling Bullshit. You're Full of Bullshit. Teachers don't get fired that easily and definitely not for giving unsolicited advice. Go back to fantasy island.", "The school where I worked, the only teacher who ever got fired was banging a student.", "She said you should put up more \"age appropriate\" decorations? I'm not sure what that means. Have you been in her classroom? What does she have for decorations. \n\nI'm also not sure why you would go to the principal and say, \"Mary told me to put up age-appropriate decorations.\" and why that would get her fired.\n\nI worked with a teacher who made some poor decisions. The district offered a sweet retirement bonus if he would retire early. He wasn't eligible age-wise so he continued teaching. It took years and more lapses in judgment to remove him. Retirement is a much cheaper option than termination.\n\nIf Mary is 65, she is probably eligible to retire. There's no way a district would risk a lawsuit by firing her over this. \n\nIt's November. I assume you didn't decorate your room within the  past 2 weeks. Has she said anything to you before now? If she's making the suggestion right before conferences, maybe she's trying to save you a parent complaint. Mary suggesting any changes: thank you for the suggestions. Parent complaint: We had a parent complain. You need to remove the LED lights.", "Yta. Why should she be fired? Bc she doesn\u2019t like your wall art? For real? What does this have to do with her teaching skills? Why did you have to report her in the first place?", "I mean, NTA, but how could she be fired for giving you a suggestion? It\u2019s not like she went in and took them down herself. I don\u2019t even really get what you tattled about? Just that you were offended she didn\u2019t like your posters? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wrong to tell the principal, but it\u2019s also kind of a nothingburger.", "NTA Mary's behavior was rude. But not an offense that calls for firing. If that happened it's for a different reason. Good job standing up for yourself.", "Why did you go to the principal in the first place? What did she say that warranted that? Did she make offensive comments when suggesting you change the decorations?\n\nWhat grade do you teach? \n\nWhy are you decorating your classroom with a lot of stuff not academically relevant in any way? While I do absolutely agree with what your decor is saying, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s appropriate classroom decor.", "Why would she get fired for just a comment to you?  If a school fires a qualified teacher for such a stupid thing then they deserve to be short staffed.\n\nNAH", "NTA. She isn\u2019t going to be fired for one action. Teachers have contracts with specific clauses in them that have to be met in order for them to be dismissed. The other teachers should know that since they have one too. Besides that, it\u2019s not her business or responsibility to tell you how to decorate your classroom. Unless it\u2019s against school policy, the teachers are encouraged to decorate how they wish. She\u2019s obviously old school and doesn\u2019t like the way newer teachers don\u2019t treat their rooms like sterile hospital rooms.", "YTA. Your principal is not your mother, & you shouldn\u2019t involve them in every disagreement you have with other teachers.  Your saying that you could get a teacher fired for something like this makes me wonder if you\u2019re actually a middle school student rather than a teacher. Hello, have you heard of teacher unions or even teacher contracts? Contracts spell out the reasons teachers can be fired, & criticizing someone else\u2019s classroom decorations is unlikely to be a reason to fire someone. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re friends with your principal because it looks like you\u2019re well on the way to creating a workplace reputation as someone who makes fusses & complains to the principal about nothing.", "If she was fired it was was for far more than that. That was just one of the last nails in her coffin. Or maybe she said something very offensive trying to defend herself and THAT was the final straw. We\u2019ll never know. But it\u2019s not your fault. NTA", "NTA. If she does get fired, there's probably a lot more going on behind the scenes than just this one incident.", "YTA - she made a suggestion and you whine to the principal, wtf!?!? You could have said, you\u2019ll take it in to consideration or you could have just ignored her. \n\nMaking a suggestion hurts your feelings that much that you have to cry to the principal, really, grow up.", "YTA. It would be quite surprising that a principal can randomly fire a long term teacher because she made a suggestion to another teacher about room decor. Maybe as you grow older, you will learn to handle differences as an adult and not a teenager.\n\nThere is no reason to report another teacher because of a difference of opinion. Yes, you are an AH!", "ESH, she was obviously being shitty, but after you told her no, escalating it to the principle was unecessary.\n\nHowever I doubt she'll be fired \"deal with mary\" sounds more like telling her to pull her head in than firing her, and if she does get fired the principal would be the arsehole.\n\nAlso what exactly did she mean by age apropriate out of curiosity?", "NTA but i do think her being fired was a bit too much, other than that you sound like one of the more fun teachers that we need more of", "YTA.  She made a suggestion and you went nuclear for no real/discernible reason.  I almost went with E-S-H but honestly I\u2019m not even seeing where the issue is here.  If Mary is as old as you say she might have been genuinely trying to save you from some AH parents and save you a bit of stress, especially if she\u2019s been working in schools for a long time.  I get it, you spent a lot of time on your decorations, but sometimes parents are jerks about things like this (source: I have friends and family in education; I have heard stories).  You include no information about her tone so I\u2019m assuming it wasn\u2019t that bad or you would have included it, since you\u2019re the type to immediately take offence and whinge to the principal about this.  Grow up, honestly. You sound difficult.  Don\u2019t be surprised when the other teachers stop speaking to you.", "NTA. And think its more reasons to fire her that only because she ask for put It down some decorations.", "NTA. All of you commenting should get up to speed on how much is really takes to fire someone. There must have been complaints from others about Mary from teachers or even parents.", "NTA\n\nNot clear why this all had to be escalated though. It is as simple as this is my classroom and it is decorated as I see fit and I will give your recommendation the attention it deserves.", "I'm sure the teacher's union would have a field day if Mary were fired over simply asking you to take down decorations, it's not like she pulled a Tammy Metzler. I'm going to say ESH because it seems like you wanted an excuse to rat on Mary for something, all teacher friends I have would roll their eyes and move on.", "YTA because this is not something to escalate to the big boss.", "Many here say NTA. I say definitely TA. The main reason is you are trying to use your friendship with the principal to your advantage. An advantage that could cause a teacher to lose their livelihood and pay bills to live. There's no other way around it. There's no reason to tout how you and the principal are homies unless to flaunt that she's going to do your bidding just because you are friends.\n\nHer making that suggestion isn't even a writeup offense let alone being fired. You should just grow a damn pair already, say it's none of her concern and let that shyt go.", "NTA, 65 year old, just retire already.  Sounds like teaching skills are out of date anyway.  You probably did the kids a favor.", "ESH.  \n\n\nMary shouldn't have stuck her nose in your business. You shouldn't have escalated a minor tiff into a potentially fireable offence.", "NTA.\n\nTeachers don\u2019t get fired because they hate posters or your decoration tastes. \n\nThis was obliviously The last in what I\u2019ll say think small straws.", "NTA and thanks for not backing down to hatred.   I\u2019m going to guess this isn\u2019t Mary\u2019s first attempt at bullying other teachers", "ESH\n\nShe was an AH for saying that to you. But then you went and told the principal, which is escalating the situation, there was no need for that imo. \n\nIf you were just talking to the principal as a friend you should have said something after their comment.", "yta\n\nteachers know off the teachers union. firing a teacher is hard, no one , nvm a teacher would asume a teacher would get fired for suggesting a change in decor.... with not even a witness. Proof is a thing, even if it was a fireable offence, what suggesting a change in decor is not. \n\nA teacher accused off dealing drugs without proof does not even get fired, but suspended, so....", "NTA. idk if this is something that was worth escalating to your boss. that having been said, if she somehow gets fired over it, this wouldn't be the sole reason. \n\nthe only way this could lead to her termination would be if she already had a stack of former complaints/issues within the workplace. this might be the last straw, so to speak, but not likely the only one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
