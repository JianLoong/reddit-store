I feel I need to give back story. \n\nSo Me (35F) and my ex (35M) had a daughter (11) together. He left me when she was 2 to be able to date a coworker. It was terrible at the time but I see it as a blessing now so water under the bridge I suppose. \n\nBut since this split, he slowly has come out of the picture. At first we split time evenly the first few years until he ended up buying a house with his inheritance that was a few hours away. Still not too far so we agreed she would stay with me (and my boyfriend) to go to school (she was 5 at this p oint) and he would see her every other weekend. This was fine the first few months then he slowly started making excuses to which it ended up being he would see her once every month or two.\n\n The first summer after all of this, I asked if I can get some money for summer programs (to split) since my boyfriend and I  had work. He made a big deal about me \u201cwanting his money\u201d and we ended up in an agreement where he would take her for half the summer so we would only need to pay for our half of summer care. Whatever, fine by me. Now fast forward to about a year ago. \n\n He decided to sell his house and buy a new house the next state over. I found this out through my daughter. When I asked him about it, he said yes and that he\u2019s moving in a couple weeks. Ok. I asked him what this meant for our daughter and him and he said it shouldn\u2019t change how things currently are. (Splitting summers and taking her during half of Christmas break). I of course didn\u2019t believe him but I said ok. This would require flying and he would have to fly with her since I\u2019m not comfortable with her flying alone at this age. He agreed to this.\nNow there\u2019s had been a few instances I asked him for money like for splitting a big medical bill or help with pay for after school activities and it\u2019s always met with hostility. My now husband (same as boyfriend from earlier) had brought up child support back when he moved a few hours away and I just didn\u2019t want to deal with the drama. \n\nBut now it has been a year since he moved out of state and he only saw her during Christmas last year. Didn\u2019t contact me at all for summer. Hasn\u2019t called his daughter since April so I felt at this point he really should at least be paying child support since he doesn\u2019t contribute anywhere else in any way. \n\nWell he got contacted recently about custody/child support and he\u2019s livid with me. He\u2019s trying to make me feel  like I\u2019m an AH and trying to take his money when we\u2019re comfortable without him. While that may be true, that\u2019s not the point at all in my opinion.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re financially stable without that money.

Go get that child support", "NTA. And who cares if he\u2019s upset? All communication around child support can go through the lawyers, if he\u2019s not going to be reasonable and respectful to you.

End of story. He isn't engaging with his child, and he has not remotely paid his share. Personally, I would go after him for back support for all the years he hasn't paid.

In hindsight I should\u2019ve done something sooner though.", "100% agree.  Money doesn't bring happiness. It brings comfort, and deadbeats don't deserve to be comfortable.
