I feel I need to give back story. \n\nSo Me (35F) and my ex (35M) had a daughter (11) together. He left me when she was 2 to be able to date a coworker. It was terrible at the time but I see it as a blessing now so water under the bridge I suppose. \n\nBut since this split, he slowly has come out of the picture. At first we split time evenly the first few years until he ended up buying a house with his inheritance that was a few hours away. Still not too far so we agreed she would stay with me (and my boyfriend) to go to school (she was 5 at this p oint) and he would see her every other weekend. This was fine the first few months then he slowly started making excuses to which it ended up being he would see her once every month or two.\n\n The first summer after all of this, I asked if I can get some money for summer programs (to split) since my boyfriend and I  had work. He made a big deal about me \u201cwanting his money\u201d and we ended up in an agreement where he would take her for half the summer so we would only need to pay for our half of summer care. Whatever, fine by me. Now fast forward to about a year ago. \n\n He decided to sell his house and buy a new house the next state over. I found this out through my daughter. When I asked him about it, he said yes and that he\u2019s moving in a couple weeks. Ok. I asked him what this meant for our daughter and him and he said it shouldn\u2019t change how things currently are. (Splitting summers and taking her during half of Christmas break). I of course didn\u2019t believe him but I said ok. This would require flying and he would have to fly with her since I\u2019m not comfortable with her flying alone at this age. He agreed to this.\nNow there\u2019s had been a few instances I asked him for money like for splitting a big medical bill or help with pay for after school activities and it\u2019s always met with hostility. My now husband (same as boyfriend from earlier) had brought up child support back when he moved a few hours away and I just didn\u2019t want to deal with the drama. \n\nBut now it has been a year since he moved out of state and he only saw her during Christmas last year. Didn\u2019t contact me at all for summer. Hasn\u2019t called his daughter since April so I felt at this point he really should at least be paying child support since he doesn\u2019t contribute anywhere else in any way. \n\nWell he got contacted recently about custody/child support and he\u2019s livid with me. He\u2019s trying to make me feel  like I\u2019m an AH and trying to take his money when we\u2019re comfortable without him. While that may be true, that\u2019s not the point at all in my opinion.

I don\u2019t want her to end up with him and my husband sees her like his daughter so she should stay here.", "He's saved a tonn of money already by not paying child support for many years. Maybe you should ask him to see the account he should've saved up for your daughter by not paying for many years. I bet he haven't saved a dime, and he won't in the future either.", "You know damn well he isn't saving shit for any of you. Get that child support op and fuck your ex. Nta", "NTA.  That money is for your kid, & he owes it.  He wasn't going to pay voluntarily.  He doesn't want to be a parent, & he doesn't want to pay to take care of his child.  He's no victim, your child is.", "If he\u2019s ok with saving money himself, then why is he sniveling about child support?", "You don't have to explain anything to him.  This is his child, and child support is for your daughter.  Look, at some point your daughter is going to understand her father wants nothing to do with her.  The emotional fallout from that is going to cut deep and be felt for years.  You can at least soften that blow by letting her know (if/when appropriate) that while some ppl aren't cut out to be parents, but he did meet his financial obligations to her. Sometimes, it's kinder to bend the truth.   This may not be the right path for everyone, or even you but it was for me.  My kids therapist supported this approach.  Kids aren't dumb, and when mine older, they figured out the truth.  But due to therapy, they were provided the tools and time needed to help process.", "Don\u2019t tell him anything and don\u2019t justify anything to him.  Avoid responding to him about anything other than visitation or talking to your daughter until child support gets settled.  The idea is not to make him so mad he goes underground with his jobs so you can\u2019t get child support.", "Wow. He acts like he doesn\u2019t have a daughter that he loves and wants to take care of. NTA.", "Yeah but he probably wouldn\u2019t\u2026 he has kept any other promises/deals so far\u2026 so he likely wouldn\u2019t with saving for college.  Besides which, your child deserves this money even if you don\u2019t need it (a slightly better summer program, you being able to take time off/work less hours to be there for her, medical", "Paying child support is legally required, and bare minimum required of a father", "Tell him he can also save, in addition to child support. Because cs is for her life now, and wether you use it or keep it for her is no concern of him. But he doesn't stop being a parent because he is far. She will need money for colleges for her wedding, downpayme't ... he can help her too", "YA not for filing child support but not telling him he finds out when they are repossessing his car or his next paycheck is garnished not cool", ">he said he could\u2019ve saved that money himself\n\n\n\nYou'll just need to kindly point out to him the past instances of his word being worthless.", "yeah sure he can. as if.", "You gonna get a DNA test?", ">Deadbeat should have been paying as soon as he left and made you primary parent. Don\u2019t let him weasel out again by falling for the victim act. He made the kid, he has a legal and moral obligation.\n\n>Get back pay for the 11 years he shirked/did the bare minimum.\n\nGet the back pay. \n\nKeep all the documentation of how hard it was to get him to pay at all. Never show it to your daughter for your own emotional gratification, but if she comes to you one day as a teenager or young adult who has heard a sob story after reconnecting with dad, you will have a record of what really went down.", "Actually she did roe v wade was still in affect back then", "This. He's already abandoned his responsibility. He will not save any money for her.", "He has no moral obligation if you could have terminated and chose not to then he has no moral obligations to you or YOUR child as you had no moral obligation to get a termination to free him from fatherhood", "No he is she has trapped him in a legal mire because she wanted a child i think a state fund should be set up to pay for child support and make all tax payers pay roe v wade would come back so fast", "Because he doesn't why does everyone get up mens asses about fatherhood when all this dude wanted was to cum", "So in my state, you can only go back 4 years in back pay from the first child support request. I\u2019m planning on doing the fullest I can.", "Came here to say this! Get that back pay.", "You realize the rebound from this is greater no contact from father to daughter at best other wise she'll never hear the end of it my father finished child support nearly 20 years ago and he still complains to me like its my problem.", "I'm sorry you had that experience but mine was the exact opposite. My dad was upset about having to officially pay child support but we never heard a word about it until my mom mentioned it years later. \n\nGood dads put in the effort and deadbeat dads... don't. No use tiptoeing around them hoping they'll eventually change their ways. Much better to prioritize your kid and at least make sure she has financial stability.", "I'm sorry your father was terrible, but a) Without support he sees her once a year already, and b) If he's the kind of person who'd blame her for child support then she's better off without him in her life as he isn't fit to be a parent."]}
