Also did she ask you to take the vacation? I understand being jealous but you OK\u2019d it before hand? Def not very fair it seems.", "NTA, she wouldn\u2019t do a trip with you and if money is tight and she went anyway she should be cognizant to limit spending as much as possible.  Overspending when things are already tight can cause long term financial distress.  If she knew how tight money was, Christmas a week or so away with additional gifts to buy, she should not have gone.\n\nShe has every right to go but that doesn\u2019t mean it was what was right for the family and sounds quite selfish on her part.", "NTA. Being financially responsible is important. More than that, you were gracious enough not to put the brakes on her trip despite how it makes you feel.\n\nI'd recommend pulling aside the money to fulfill your responsibilities so she doesn't dip into it accidentally. She's on her vacation, I'm sure she's not thinking as clearly as she would when she has to put in the hours; it's weird, vacations have a way of making one feel very carefree. Good luck!", "NTA. She doesn't care, obviously, about your concerns about the finances and is spending to suit herself, at your collective expense. Why you're then cutting back to make up for her idiocy is beyond me. I'd have to wonder what kind of woman you've married who so easily ignores your legitimate concerns for her own short-term satisfaction.", "NTA - this is why I'm an advocate of mine, theirs, and ours accounts. I don't want to be nickle and dimed on what I'm spending, and don't want to have to worry about my partner overspending and messing up already accounted for funds.", "NTA. She is being very flippant about your finances.", "You told her to be careful and watch her spending, but nowhere did you say that you a agreed to a specific budget for this trip. She might have felt that she was being careful because \"careful\" isn't a firm number and those words mean different things to different people. You should have discussed how much she could afford, arrive at a number, then hold her to that. Pro tip: when setting spending budget for occasional purchases, like Christmas, set the budget low, that way when spouse overspends you won't be mad because you actually expected spouse to spend as much as they did.

The last part of your post says it all, you're actively monitoring her spending and critiquing out of jealousy and basically ruining or reducing her enjoyment on her trip.\n\nFinancial responsibility is important but actively monitoring your spouses spending and commenting on it day by day is jealous, controlling behavior that has nothing to do with financial responsibility.\n\n\nLeave her alone to enjoy her trip, when the dust settles sort out your finances together, and plan a trip for yourself soon. If she overspent talk about it then, not while she's on her trip.", "YTA.  God forbid your hard working wife gets a chance to relax and enjoy.\n\nAnd you ruin it because you are petty.\n\nNot a supportive partner.", "I think there is too much missing from your post for a real decision but soft YTA for acting superior about finances but only having one bank account. It is important you both have accounts where you can put money to spend on whatever you want, without scrutiny, that is separate from the joint account where bill payments come from.", "YTA and calling her daily is not helping. Tell her how much discretionary money is available and leave it at that. The results will tell you who she is. As it is you are coming across as controlling.\n\nMy wife and I started out with a joint account and I paid the bills from it. She constantly said things like \u201chow am I supposed to know what\u2019s available? You pay all the bills\u201d when I said something about her spending. We tried having her pay the bills and almost lost the house because she forgets to pay things. We got separate accounts and split the bills\u2026same result. \n\nNow we\u2019ve had separate accounts for years and she sends me her portion of the bills and some savings. The rest is hers do do with as she will. The fights have ended and the bills get paid.", "Red Flags....everywhere.   \n\nShe probably isn't  traveling with her \"girlfriends.\"\n\nStart monitoring everything.", "Was the vaca cost coming out of the joint account ? If so, has this account been used this way before or is it primarily used for bills?", "NTA. She needs to learn financial responsibility. Split the accounts, one for bills and then one for each of you to spend on what you want. Maybe even go a step further and create a fourth for bills related to her possessions and explain that those are now her responsibility to take care of. You\u2019ll handle the rest of the bills but her car and anything else that is here becomes her responsibility. Hopefully that will teach her to better manage the finances. If she doesn\u2019t like that idea then explain to her why you\u2019re suggesting it and that ultimately it\u2019s to make sure that the bills that have to be paid are going to be taken care of.", "NTA. She\u2019s a cake eater. Sorry but that\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen. I\u2019d do your very best to separate finances as much as possible and don\u2019t do any new joint financial actions. Her car is in her name, her loan, her financial obligation, etc\u2026.  \n\nSorry but at some not to distant point she\u2019ll be out the door and you\u2019ll be left holding the bag. Better to be prepared for that with separate finances", "NTA. She should have not went on the trip. She is brushing you off because you let her brush you off.  She will continue to disrespect you for as long as you let her disrespect you. The fact she felt it was ok go on the trip (which I seriously doubt it was last minute to her, but just last minute to you) after telling you no a couple of months ago and has completely ignored you concerning her spending. Shows she doesn\u2019t care what you think or respect you.", "I thought one account would be great seeing as I pay the bills but I just might have to do this.", "I would strongly recommend not to do this. Friends of mine did this and both the husband and wife each got credit cards the other didnt know about and used their individual checking accounts simply to service debt payments on the credit card.

Yes, I did ok the trip. I didn\u2019t want to seem controlling by telling her no she couldn\u2019t go. That\u2019s why I asked her to be mindful of the spending.", "Thank you for the advice", "Yeah but then you have to worry about your partner not signing up for credit cards and racking up debt.  Having their own checking that you dont have access to they can hide debt from you much easier.  Seen it happen to numerous friends and family members.", "Yeah that\u2019s not how finances work. If she overspends and they can\u2019t pay the bills because she\u2019s out of control that\u2019s actually a big deal.", "It\u2019s not being monitored out of jealousy. It\u2019s being monitored because we still have other financial responsibilities. She does not check the account often to see what is left.

I\u2019m just the one who pays the bills. The only bill she has to pay is the Car Insurance which I have to remind her often to pay. She hardly checks the account to see what is available I\u2019m usually the one to tell her how much we have left.

It's a crap dynamic and YTA for not recognizing what it would feel like to be on the other side of it. Nobody wants to feel like they are being watched and judged all the time. \n\nThere are dozens of tried and tested ways to manage joint finances and \"put it all in one account and constantly nag  your partner\" is not one of them.", "Ahhh so you were doing it for her, you are not jealous or controlling,, glad you cleared that up", "I think that answer may be part of the problem. I know that over the years, when either my husband or I were pretty much solely responsible for paying the bills, it didn\u2019t really work very well. The other one was usually *very* out of touch with our finances. \n\nWhen we worked on our finances **together**, things were much better. We each knew where we stood and what our goals were and what potential dangers lay ahead (like possible car repairs or an extremely old HVAC system).

You guys need your own money. My husband and I put all our earnings in one bank account and then we each take out the same amount each month for our own spending.
