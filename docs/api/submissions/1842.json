How much was left when you began eating it?", "YTA. I will be in the minority here. I find it really confusing  and insulting that pregnant women aren't expected to act like adults. Like I think we should be readily forgiven for not being considerate when we are growing a whole human in their body, but I don't think that we get a pass from acting like considerate adults. You are putting your germs in a tub of ice cream. It's not that hard to use a bowl and spoon. Eat as much as you want, but give someone the option to have some if they want. You can't help the tears because your hormones are haywire. But you can just move on from this and use a bowl. It's doesn't have to be a big deal.", "Yta. Other people might want it. You are pregnant and can share ice cream. In your own home, you do you..when a guest with other guests, assume that everything is shared... Also, she clearly wanted some. I don't find what you are doing gross btw. And don't judge you for eating it all. But next time, before finishing it off, check that no one else wants some...", "Understandable, but YTA.  Unless it's labeled for you or otherwise segregated from the other foods, a guest or even other people in the house have no way of knowing you're eating out of the tub.  And let's be honest - it's gross and a bit rude to spoon it from a huge tub directly into your mouth.  Not fatal and not worth crying over, but since you're a guest in someone's home, probably best to just use common, basic manners.", "Ok someone tell me why it\u2019s gross to eat from the tub of the ice cream when only u are eating it? My son and I like different ice cream and I eat mine from the tub over the course of a few days and my mom always says it\u2019s gross.

I'm gonna say NTA because that ice cream was bought specifically for OP. MIL asked what she was craving and it was that specific ice cream. If goddaughter or anyone else wants some they can request it too or go get it themselves.", "YTA\n\nEating and drinking directly from communal containers is disgusting.

But also the ice cream was bought specifically for you and who cares I would still eat out of the tub after you.", "Nta the fact is that the ice cream was bought with op in mind there were cartons left and op had offered in a past and nobody wanted any.  The goddaughter was plain and simple  rude and of course op cried considering her hormones are out of control and she was just insulted for eating the ice cream meant for her.", "NTA obviously people did not bother to read. The ice cream was specifically for HER. It was HER ICE CREAM BOUGHT JUST FOR HER", "NTA, people need to stop moralizing this. It's not like you rubbed your butt on the pizza everyone was about to eat, you ate ice cream that was bought for you, that no one else wanted, out of the container. It doesn't sound like cousin even wanted some, she just wanted to be judgy. And staying with parents is ideally NOT the same as being a guest in someone's home. Rules get relaxed a little. People can think it's gross, people can prefer to have everyone in their house use a bowl at all times, but it's not fair to call you an asshole over this. Cousin is for being so outspoken and rude with her judgement. We don't call people names.", "Just label the one you're eating out of so everyone knows not to grab that one. Simple. (NAH).", "Lol NTA. I don't get the Y T A votes either. The ice cream was specifically bought *for her* and there was a ton of tubs. I'm assuming op wasn't sneak eating it out of the tub and was in the open.

I buy communal ice cream and I buy me ice cream.", "Sorry momma, soft YTA.  You are a guest in someone's home.  You basically made it yours without thinking of others.

Depending on how long they've stayed and how long they plan on staying, I disagree. My family (Mom, Dad, brother, me) had to move in with my grandparents during the pandemic. We stayed for about 5 months. We were no longer guests in their home, we were co-inhabitants. As such, we had our own spaces, our own chores, and our own food. Most of the stuff just for 1 person was either something no one else wanted, or everyone was told that it was just for one person. Because we would just fucking ask one another. Sometimes things would get marked as someone's if it was definitely only theirs (foods for health issues, mainly) but it was never a big deal. My grandparents would buy edible cookie dough for me and I would eat it out of the carton because everyone knew it was mine. No one else wanted it. And it was pint, so I ate it quickly.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: Even if you are a guest, this is not a big deal.

I agree with some of the other comments, it definitely sounds like she was picking a fight and trying to upset you. There was plenty more ice cream if she actually wanted some (doubtful) and even if there wasn\u2019t, there was absolutely no reason to call you greedy or to accuse you of crying to be manipulative. Kudos to your husband for being supportive and congratulations on your pregnancy.", "NTA my daughter and I never put our ice cream in bowls because we buy what we like for ourselves.

OP enjoys their tub(s) of ice cream with a spoon and comfy seat. No one voices any issues or complaints. \n\nDays into vacay, 25 year old GD arrives. Same day of arrival, GD asks OP about eating the ice cream like so, OP answers honestly. \n\nGD then insults OP by calling them greedy and starts an entire argument over how OP eats the ice cream. OP ends up crying due to hormones and unnecessary stress (which is harmful during pregnancy). \n\nOPs husband is reasonably upset after hearing about the argument. MIL is trying to be diplomatic at first, but GD doubles down and accuses pregnant OP of manipulating everyone with tears.\n\nThe simple resolution to GDs issues was to just talk to OP like an adult.

OP is vulnerable because she is pregnant and not in her own home, GD is old enough to understand and have empathy instead of verbally attacking her relative. \n\nNo matter how the GD felt about OP eating that tub of ice cream, OP was about to finish the already open tub.

Sorry I will mark this one with my name, so you know which has may germs in it, but feel free to open a fresh carton there\u2019s a half dozen more in the freezer.\u201d It seems that OP want being intentionally rude or selfish, but it absolutely comes off that way from the perspective of the god daughter.

My daughter gets one and I get one. While I do agree it\u2019s ok to eat directly out of the pint we both like putting the ice cream in mugs and adding milk for a super extra thick \u201cshake\u201d. But I always take a couple bites out of the tub. It\u2019s her ice cream she can eat how she wants and why dirty a bowl?
