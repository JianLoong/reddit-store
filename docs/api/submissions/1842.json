How much was left when you began eating it?", "YTA. I will be in the minority here. I find it really confusing  and insulting that pregnant women aren't expected to act like adults. Like I think we should be readily forgiven for not being considerate when we are growing a whole human in their body, but I don't think that we get a pass from acting like considerate adults. You are putting your germs in a tub of ice cream. It's not that hard to use a bowl and spoon. Eat as much as you want, but give someone the option to have some if they want. You can't help the tears because your hormones are haywire. But you can just move on from this and use a bowl. It's doesn't have to be a big deal.", "Yta. Other people might want it. You are pregnant and can share ice cream. In your own home, you do you..when a guest with other guests, assume that everything is shared... Also, she clearly wanted some. I don't find what you are doing gross btw. And don't judge you for eating it all. But next time, before finishing it off, check that no one else wants some...", "Understandable, but YTA.  Unless it's labeled for you or otherwise segregated from the other foods, a guest or even other people in the house have no way of knowing you're eating out of the tub.  And let's be honest - it's gross and a bit rude to spoon it from a huge tub directly into your mouth.  Not fatal and not worth crying over, but since you're a guest in someone's home, probably best to just use common, basic manners.", "Ok someone tell me why it\u2019s gross to eat from the tub of the ice cream when only u are eating it? My son and I like different ice cream and I eat mine from the tub over the course of a few days and my mom always says it\u2019s gross.

I'm gonna say NTA because that ice cream was bought specifically for OP. MIL asked what she was craving and it was that specific ice cream. If goddaughter or anyone else wants some they can request it too or go get it themselves.", "YTA\n\nEating and drinking directly from communal containers is disgusting.

The MIL's goddaughter is a *guest*. You mean to tell me the goddaughter is randomly rummaging through the pantry and ish and isn't asking what she can and cannot eat? The ice cream was bought for OP, if there is a a lot that was bought, as OP is stated, then this isn't an issue", "NTA that\u2019s why they make those smaller tubs, so you don\u2019t need to use a bowl. If it was a gallon then you would be. But also the ice cream was bought specifically for you and who cares I would still eat out of the tub after you.", "Nta the fact is that the ice cream was bought with op in mind there were cartons left and op had offered in a past and nobody wanted any.  The goddaughter was plain and simple  rude and of course op cried considering her hormones are out of control and she was just insulted for eating the ice cream meant for her.", "NTA obviously people did not bother to read. The ice cream was specifically for HER. It was HER ICE CREAM BOUGHT JUST FOR HER", "NTA, people need to stop moralizing this. It's not like you rubbed your butt on the pizza everyone was about to eat, you ate ice cream that was bought for you, that no one else wanted, out of the container. It doesn't sound like cousin even wanted some, she just wanted to be judgy. And staying with parents is ideally NOT the same as being a guest in someone's home. Rules get relaxed a little. People can think it's gross, people can prefer to have everyone in their house use a bowl at all times, but it's not fair to call you an asshole over this. Cousin is for being so outspoken and rude with her judgement. We don't call people names.", "Just label the one you're eating out of so everyone knows not to grab that one. Simple. (NAH).", "Lol NTA. I don't get the Y T A votes either. The ice cream was specifically bought *for her* and there was a ton of tubs. I'm assuming op wasn't sneak eating it out of the tub and was in the open.

I buy communal ice cream and I buy me ice cream.", "Sorry momma, soft YTA.  You are a guest in someone's home.  You basically made it yours without thinking of others.

Certain types of premium ice cream like the [Tip Top Magnum tub](https://i0.wp.com/www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Magnum-Ice-Cream-Tub-Milk-Chocolate-Vanilla.jpg?resize=550%2C550&ssl=1) are pretty much DESIGNED to be eaten straight from the tub :P", "Ops gonna learn the hard way she's creating a perfect breeding ground for listeria which pregnant women should avoid.", "GD was told there was more unopened if she wanted some and still snarks back with the greedy jab. Unnecessary, very rude, and very much not about the ice cream. She's got some other issue with OP. Sounds like jealousy to me, the way she came at her and insulted her for something that was none of her business. She didn't buy the ice cream or the house she was standing in. NTA", "\u201cSobs dramatically\u201d or cries because she\u2019s getting chastised while she\u2019s got a flood of hormones and she\u2019s sensitive at this time.", "Found the goddaughter", "How do you get slob from the one thing?  To me, that would imply more like leaving a mess everywhere. Like dumping dirty clothes, towels, and dishes in a trail behind you.", "She said that she planned on eating the entire thing though,\nLike why get a bowl when she was finishing it?", "What if the mother-in-law or whoever owned the house bought ice cream for herself? Would she then be obligated to share it with everyone else? \n\nNot arguing, just asking.", "They quite literally bought it for OP. It\u2019s her ice cream.", "Well that\u2019s apples and oranges. Thanksgiving meals are shared for everybody. \nAs for eating out of the open container vs the closed one, I get what you\u2019re saying. But once the other guest saw what OP was doing she shouldn\u2019t have made a big deal out of it. She should have just accepted that she didn\u2019t want to eat out of that tub. And why are so many people acting like OP was hocking spit loogies into the tub? It\u2019s not likes she\u2019s spitting in it or even licking the tub itself. She\u2019s using a spoon.", "Weird germaphobes who think they are entitled to a pregnant woman's snacks.", "If someone comes over I feel like they should be asking before just grabbing ice cream from the freezer. It\u2019s weird to go to someone\u2019s home and assume the ice cream in their freezer is fair game. If the ice cream was bought for/eat exclusively by OP then this isn\u2019t exactly her being the AH. \n\nNTA\n\nETA: It was a *pint* she\u2019s absolutely not the AH here. No reasonable person assumes a pint is fair game.", "Oh. Thanks. I missed that. Hope she labels it then.", "But honestly what does that matter? The parents who actually live in the house, aren\u2019t eating the ice cream and neither is the husband, the parents don\u2019t even eat ice cream. They\u2019ve already seen her eat straight from the tub and clearly don\u2019t care because they know it\u2019s for her. It\u2019s unfortunate another guest in the house (who arrived days later) was unaware, but a lot of these Y T A comments are coming from a place that assumes it\u2019s a \u201ccommunal tub\u201d as if they actual residents of the house are also sharing it, they\u2019re not. This appears to be a miscommunication with another guest, and there are more unopened tubs of ice cream. I\u2019d say there are NAH.", "there\u2019s other pints in the fridge, anyone could literally just eat from the unopened ones knowing that that specific tub was hers. Also MIL specifically bought that ice cream for her", "OP is clearly an adult too. Yet, she isn\u2019t buying her own ice cream.", "That sounds about right and the hormones and everything are the worst! Constant moods swings, pain, your insides feel like they are being rearrange (and they literally are) and then you feel like your slowly suffocating because babe is pushing on your lungs and they can't expand very well. It's not fun.", "This depends on the size of the container I think. If we are talking Ben and Jerry\u2019s size, sure it\u2019s hers and hers alone. But if we are talking full size Blue Bell carton then she shouldn\u2019t have assumed that the entire thing was hers. No one needs to eat an entire carton of ice cream ever, not even when a person is pregnant. Maybe over the course of a couple of weeks but not over the course of a few days. On top of that she was a guest in their home. Be gross in your own home but have respect for others when your in someone else\u2019s home. \n\nI think there is too much missing info to truly pass judgment. I want to know size of carton, she mentioned the in-laws bought several, did she eat them all prior to this incident or was there other containers in the freezer that other people could eat?", "No, she can still use a spoon and dig a portion out of a tub into a bowl like everyone else. OP made it clear that she ate from the tub without consideration for anyone else over a couple of days. It's rude, pregnancy isn't an excuse.", "When she saw her doing it several days into the trip and was appalled. It was clearly not her existing assumption that the carton in the freezer was spit-contaminated.", "Ewww all the bacteria in that milk carton.  Gross", "Yeah, IF I know someone ate the stuff straight from the tub I would choose an unopened tub.\n\nBut without that knowledge it would be logical to use the opened tub first... or do you open a new tub every time you want some icecream?", "Ya let\u2019s open multiple tubs at once. Instead of just using one at a time and expecting people to eat from bowls.", "Her in laws asked what she wanted and bought it for her. How is it so hard to understand", "OP said that the containers were pints and there were multiple unopened in the freezer", "Where are you reading that she was appalled? Did OP add that in the comments? All it says in the post is that MIL tried to smooth things over between the goddaughter, OP, and OP\u2019s husband.", "good thing you\u2019re not drinking it :) p.s. there\u2019s more bacteria in your bed and on your pillow than in my oatmilk, because I don\u2019t drink from it. it was a hypothetical answer to your dumb question", "I don\u2019t know why this is so hard for you to understand. Communal groceries belong to everyone in the household. Even when 1 household member has had productive sex.", "Sorry, I was mistaking the MIL for the goddaughter. It seems to me that goddaughter would have said something the first time she saw it and they\u2019d been there together for several days.", "It\u2019s not communal ice cream. It was bought FOR OP. The in laws don\u2019t eat it and that left her and her husband. Get it through your head", "Ahh, got it. Maybe goddaughter just didn\u2019t see it until a couple of days into the trip.", "I think this person just wants an argument tbh!"]}
