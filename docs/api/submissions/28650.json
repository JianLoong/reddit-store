They also have a young child who is living with the husband and being taken care of by his parents when he is at work.\n\nNow here is where people are going to have to start keeping score - \n\nThe STBXW in this situation is actually the sister of my former fianc\u00e9e, Sarah. We are currently in a \"it's complicated\" kind of relationship. Two days ago she comes to me and says that she heard her sister and parents conspiring to falsely accuse him of something that would allow for an emergency custody hearing.\n\nShe wants my help in turning the tables on her sister - and yes, there is some bitterness here, like I said, it's complicated.\n\nNow, even though she is my former fianc\u00e9e, I think Sarah is a good person and is interested in helping, but I also wonder if she's trying to rope me into this situation to \"prove\" to me that she hates her sister. You see, the sister was an accessory to one of the main reasons why Sarah is a *former* fianc\u00e9e. \n\nMy gut instinct is to tell her to just inform Marty (and his attorney) about what is going on and to wipe our hands of the situation. However, she's urging me to help entrap her sister in some way so that she can turn evidence over to Marty so he can play the highly coveted (at least in divorces) \"uno reverse card\". Her most convincing argument is that this opportunity will probably not come again. I agree with that, but...\n\nAssuming for the moment that I actually **could** help in some way... WIBTA for not doing so? Particularly since my motivation is basically just being leery of Sarah's motivation? After all, she could theoretically just testify on Marty's behalf if it came to that.

After all, it's your profession. She's also showing you that she is a good person by wanting to help Marty, and distancing herself from her shitty family. Your options are: nothing, give Sarah ideas and options, and take real action in the situation. I think your best option is to give her ideas and suggestions.

I\u2019ve followed the story of your breakup, so I have at least some idea of the relationships.  \n\nSarah is still being scared of taking a stand, and having to deal with her own situation, so she\u2019s hoping you can be the bad guy. She may also be manipulating you. \n\nHer sister is still being an AH \n\nYour best bet is to encourage Sarah to do the right thing, but also warn Marty.  Yea, it\u2019s hearsay.  But if he tells his lawyer, they can take their own action. They might contact Sara directly. They might file a motion.  \n\nYou don\u2019t want to be involved, but that ship sailed a long time ago.

I need Sarah to go and front the claims to the lawyer and sign an affidavit, but she's reluctant to do that since it will then be obvious to her parents that she is the one who did them in. Hence why she is asking me to help her collect evidence to pass along to Marty in a more \"anonymous\" way.\n\nI honestly feel like we have been going around and around on this for the last day or so, but to put it bluntly, she's struggling with dealing with the shitshow that will erupt by being willing to testify, especially since she is currently living with her parents...\n\nI do get where she is at - she wants to do the right thing, but she's threading the needle in regards to her own situation. \n\nThe one good thing about the situation is that it won't be too late for her to testify on behalf of her soon to be former brother in law, so if she waffles a bit, hopefully she will do the right thing in the end.", "THIS\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^.

The wheels are in motion and shit might happen at any time. This isn't a movie, this is a person's life.\n\nI can give Marty the heads up, but other than that it's pretty useless because me saying that Sarah told me about a conversation is basically hearsay. I need to convince her to go and sign an affidavit, which will then become part of the legal record and probably cause her to alienate not just her sister, but her parents as well.\n\nMaybe that'd be for the best, but she's kind of resisting doing that and wants to be more underhanded.\n\nI'm probably going to split the difference on this one and try to get her to do what I think is the right thing.", "Soon to be ex wife", "Whilst you're right that it's hearsay, my thinking is that if you tell him/his lawyer you've heard what the family are planning and then they do the exact thing you said they were going to do it would hopefully carry some weight.    \n\nUnless Sarah's family have been telling anyone who'll listen about their plans I don't see how she can do anything to help Marty without the family working out she was involved.  How many people other than close family would have access to the sort of evidence she plans on collecting?  It really seems likes a situation where she needs to be all in and go on the record like you want her to or just leave it alone.", "I would tell Marty and let Marty\u2019s lawyer decide what to do with the information.
