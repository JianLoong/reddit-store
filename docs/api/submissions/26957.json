Does daycare cost more or less than you make. If daycare costs more than you make then you should stay home.

If you guys could afford to have you quit your job, would it be feasible to hire in-home child care?", "I think it really is a better outcome if children have a parent bonding and teaching  behavior one on one rather than a daycare.

There is also less chance for colds, flu, lice, etc that can be caught from other little ones.

I know my dad gets sad hearing about all the things we'd do without him while he worked, and he expected that setup from the time he was a kid. You're a mechanic- your skills will still be just as valuable in a few years when they're in school and you can work while they're in class. The memories won't be.

Sure, if you both work, the gross income is higher, but the actual household budget is lower than her take-home because it exceeds your salary. If you're worried about your spending money or what will happen in the event of a divorce, have her deposit half of the money left after bills/retirement savings into your account. Get a postnup to ensure that if you get a divorce, you will have support until you get another similar job. I don't think it's fair for one partner to expect the other to subsidize their career.", "I made an account to reply to this. The idea it is the \"right thing to do for the family\" for the lower earning parent to quit their job, is a very blinkered viewpoint. Usually, it's made on the idea that the woman's salary is lower than the man's and therefore the \"better\" option is the one that nets the numerically higher total income today. So the reasoning is: if \\[Salary of higher earning parent\\] + \\[salary of lower earning parent\\] - \\[tax\\] - \\[Daycare cost\\] < \\[salary of higher earning parent\\] - \\[tax\\]  then the ower earning parent (usually the mother) should quit her job.  But that excludes the benefit to the family of the lower earning parent remaining in paid work over the long term: salary progression, a second pot of retirement savings, a backup earner in case the higher earner gets laid off, etc. And of course it also excludes what's important to the lower earning spouse, which is their own financial independence, and, crucially, their having the financial wherewithal to get themselves out of the marriage safely if necessary. \n\nThe other factor is that, as a few others have pointed out, it's not entirely correct to attribute the \"cost\" of daycare only to the lower earning parent. Both parents are responsible for their child's care. The more logical way to portion out the cost of daycare is to attribute half of it to each parent. It's also a fairer way to evaluate who is responsible for what costs, in a country that is tending towards reducing spousal support orders, even in fairly long marriages. \"What's mine is yours\" might be said DURING the marriage, especially when the higher earning spouse is trying to convince the lower earning spouse that it will be safe to quit their job (aka give up their financial power) to stay at home with the couple's children. But once the couple start divorcing, that quickly turns into \"\\[The stay-at-home spouse\\] took half of MY house and half of MY retirement savings.\" The reality today is that the legal contract of marriage nowadays does not protect non-earning spouses as it used to, even when they spend years caring for children, which is indeed actual work (albeit unpaid). Did we not recently see in the news that Florida has moved towards very limited spousal support, even in long marriages? And yet, studies have shown that even a single year out of the workforce as a SAHM can permanently affect a woman from getting a job in the field in which she was trained. The effect on her salary potential is profound. I don't know the statistics on this for men, but I would imagine it's not much better. So people need to protect themselves by retaining their earning power if at all possible, because supporting a spouse's career at the expense of one's own career is no longer a wise decision.", "But if his income is less than daycare then they are throwing money away.

OP\u2019s wife is a royal A H", "Are they currently in daycare?", "Y\u2019all talk about it like these are high-end careers dropping out of the workforce because of the cost of childcare. If you\u2019re in a job making $15-$20/hour, you\u2019re probably not making yourself utterly unemployable by taking a break for 4-5 years. You\u2019ll go back and make more or less what you were before, maybe a buck or two an hour behind where you were.", "Exactly - lots of posts on our town\u2019s FB Moms group about former SAHs trying to get some income and not worked in 5-20 years.", "He shouldn't have to quit his job because society has historically been unfair to women. The solution isn't to be unfair to men, the solution is to be fair to everyone. If they can afford to pay for daycare, he shouldn't be expected to quit his job", "Seriously? Would you say the same if the genders were switched?", "Yeah, my perspective as a parent is that at least before primary school it\u2019s preferable for a parent to be at home with the kiddos rather then sending them off to daycare.  I\u2019m more than happy to fill that role myself. Of course it\u2019s also a luxury to be able to afford it. If I was the parent making more money, and could support my coparent in staying home, I\u2019d want the other parent to be willing to stay home too. Just because it\u2019s best for the kids.  \n\nIt sounds like if she tried to quit her job the same wouldn\u2019t be possible. She probably would actually like to be with her baby and just can\u2019t because you\u2019re not earning enough to support that lifestyle. Which is fair. But sad that you\u2019re not willing to do the same for a few years. \n\nHowever, she shouldn\u2019t be taking jabs at your income/hurting you. Of course that isn\u2019t fair either.", "im with you why can't he pony up and be a dad and raise his damn kids?", "Are they losing money? OP has stated daycare would not exceed what he brings in. So overall that is a net positive unless you start trying to tally up ever possible expense and situation. \n\nLet's also not forget she is the one that truly wants to stay home, and not the OP. I also think it is unfair to say the OP's wife is subsidizing his career without knowing if she actually is. You are making an assumption based off things we do not know.", "So no?", "If they need both incomes to pay for daycare, meaning his alone doesn\u2019t cover it, then they are not making a profit by him working. Which is the whole point. If it costs more to pay for daycare than the lower-paid worker\u2019s take home pay, you are losing money. Some people can afford this bc the higher-paid person makes soooo much. Others need every cent so it makes better financial sense to stay home. At least until kid is public/free school.", "My point was that if it exceeded your income, which it seemed to based on the way you dodged the question when others asked, it didn't make sense for you to work. Your household would be actively losing money if that was the case. You shouldn't think of daycare vs SAHP as a joint expense when married- compare the cost to the salary of the lower earner. If they either lose money or make very little, it doesn't make sense for the household to take on that expense. Instead, it's more logical to have the lower earner stay home.", "I can only think of one reason to not want to explain the wifes \"jab\" is if it wasn't one. The point that the other poster was getting at if it was really done in a spiteful way. By your defensive reply, I get the feeling it wasn't a jab.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter if your wife doesn't like her job. The point is she is willing to suck it up for the family because she knows she's the breadwinner. And yeah we use our past to dictate our family's future. But has anyone asked the kid what they want? Not to seal the deal but more informational. Because if my kid said I want you home with me dad. It would tug those heart strings and make me change my mind about working. Yeah, the kids will be OK with way things are. You don't always get enough time with them. That's my point. Screw my horrible upbringing! I want more time with my kids.\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with no or lack of education.  Being a mechanic is a noble and necessary trade. Schooling seems to have less value today. And stupid modern vehicles need more of a computer tech than a mechanic. I want my next vehicle pre-80s. All real steel and mechanical down to the windows, locks, and seat adjuster.", "I would speak to your mom then and see if she can. And yes, I don't doubt that your wife isn't ready to go back to work. And I'm not saying I condone it in the slightest, but she may have made the jab at your pay because she wants to be home with your child but you guys would have to make a lot of changes to make it work. Were I you, I would sit down with her and have a heart to heart about how she is feeling. But, do also gently let her know that what she said to you was hurtful. And, in general, be as tactful as possible. Moms tend to feel a lot when it comes to the babies, and it also isn't uncommon for women to still have hormonal issues years after childbirth. My son is almost 4 and I still get hotflashes and can sometimes be moody for random reasons.", "Is it the job itself that she hates or the company She works for? if she dislikes her company, she could always resign and stay-at-home for a few more months as she looks for a new job. If it's the actual aspects of the job itself, that might be a different story.", "The person isn\u2019t saying the wife isn\u2019t a AH.

We survived with her savings and some rentals I have. \n\nShe cannot extend the FML anymore so she has a choice to lose her position at work or go back to work.", "The jobs don't disappear, but your ability to be hired does. People with gaps in employment don't get called back, and any references they had from previous jobs are likely unreachable. So you lose your networking, get rusty on your skill set, and have a black mark on your resume. It's well recorded that stay at home parents who leave their jobs to raise the kids very rarely get back into the job field.", "There aren't just high flying careers and jobs where you just have to show up in time, with nothing in between. Now, I'm not American so our experiences may not be the same - but working in a welfare-adjacent field I often see women who apply for retail or secretarial jobs after 10+ years at home... and on paper they're absolutely employable, but in practice most companies aren't willing to retrain someone with a large employment gap when other options are available (other options being both younger people with no experience, but no family commitments either, or people who spent the last 10+ years being employed in the same field). I'm not saying it's right or that there are no exceptions, but that's something worth considering if the idea of being financially dependent for life is not something one's comfortable with.", "Being a sahp is not for everyone, and no one should have to do it if they don't want to and can afford not to.", "Who says he can't.  He's saying he doesn't want to.\n\nAre you going with 'because in the past women have wanted to do this, he should be forced to'?", "It would cover the cost, but I see no reason why my entire income should go towards childcare when we can split the cost. \n\nImagine if I told my wife that and I made more money. Sure, you can work you are just going to be responsible for paying for childcare. \n\nMy mother would kill me.", "They would split the cost, not only use one person's income. \n\nIf the wife can cover the cost of him not working, that means they can afford daycare.", "That is fair. Just not a huge fan of talking about what I make. I am not poor, or living off peanuts. My wife just made an insane amount of money.", "Like I said I did not think one had to explain tone and body language. Imo it was a jab, why else would someone mock another person's income? As constructive criticism? You are free to feel how you feel, not my place to try and sway you. \n\nI would not even say I had a horrible upbringing, I like working and I like what I do. I see no reason why one should give up both. One can be a perfectly fine parent while working, one does not have to be a stay-at-home parent to be a good one. \n\nDo not get me started on new vehicles I used to be a service tech at a BMW / MINI dealership. Holy shit. . . .\n\nCurrently working on restoring a 1973 Jaguar E-Type for a client, love working on older cars. Sad part is I make most mu money on brake and oil changes, so when the fun projects come they are a treat.", "She never wanted to be an engineer her parents forced her into due to their expectations. It also does not help she is in a male dominant field so that adds to things, she is also in a position of authority so you could imagine the BS she went through.\n\nMy wife is in a weird spot, she hates her job but likes the lifestyle it permits her to have. I grew up poor so living in a smaller space is not exactly an issue for me.\n\nTbh my wife hates working. Part of me has always wondered why she even married me LOL.", "This is why she may have made snarky remark, she has already put her job on hold for two years.  \n\nI hope y'all find a really good day care. But where I am at least, the cost exponentially increased after covid.", "If you do some research on the topic, I believe until age 3 is ideal for a kid to be with parents for the proper attachment levels.  I think if you all are willing to do 1 year with you at home, that could be a good comprimise.", "I think you\u2019re greatly overestimating what a lot of these hiring processes are like for jobs in the range we\u2019re talking about.

We\u2019re talking about workers with no college education making <50k before taxes, which is ~1/3 of Americans. For that kind of skill set, you\u2019re often working jobs where your pay is about even with the cost of daycare, barring circumstances like apprenticeships in trades and so on.\n\nUnless this is one of these weird ass \u201cyou\u2019ll never be store manager or district manager if you don\u2019t work your way up!\u201d type deals, where \u2013 lemme tell ya \u2013 none of the other couple hundred employees at your store are going to be manager, either, and it\u2019s not because of a gap in employment.\n\nIs a gap in employment damaging for people in \u201ccareers\u201d that require specialized skill sets and an education?

Let's say the wife makes $10, and her husband $2. Together, they have $12. If he stays home, they, as a couple, have $10. Now, let's say daycare is $3. They, as a couple, have $9. 10>9, so it makes sense to have him stay home in that case. The way he's dodging the question makes me think he's making less than daycare costs.", "I'd also consider if you'll need to have a cleaner come.
