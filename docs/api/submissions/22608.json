He's gone for 5 days and you took care of two toddlers by yourself that entire time.

Which is fine, you were tired I totally get that. \n\nI remember this year on our corporate retreat I asked one of the bosses of another group how he feels about going home after the week and he said \"I can't wait, I loved this trip but I miss my wife man\" \n\nLike cmon, that's adorable.

It's understandable and even awesome if your partner is excited to see you and wants to spend time together after being apart for 5 days. However, that is absolutely not your fault and not your responsibility to have accommodated, especially when you were exhausted from caring for your shared kids.

I personally make a request from him to wake me up if I\u2019m not awake so I can hear all about it (cause I love hearing about it he has fun). Firstly, if your husband had a want (you to be awake when he got home) he should have voiced it. Second, even if he HAD voiced it it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement it would be a request (which you\u2019d be allowed to say no to) that he\u2019d have to accept the answer of wether it\u2019s what he wanted or not", "THIS! ^", "I'm just a bit surprised that he hadn't already hit that phase of feeling second to the kids during hte infancy phase of the children.  By this time, dude shoulda just popped a video game/movie in and kissed everyone good night.  Like bro, you missed your wife and that's great, but she been alone 5 days with the kids, give hte girl a break and enjoy one last evening of silence before \"childageddon\" begins in the morning..", "And she hadn't even gone to bed.

My gut says he was just horny", "NTA. But I'm gonna skip the husband shaming that the rest of the comments dog piled on. Unless he let you know ahead of time that he really missed you and would like to see you before you both go to bed, he's got no room to make his hurt feelings your problem. \n\nYour answer to that request could also have been: \"thank you for letting me know you miss me, but these last couple days of solo parenting have got me really tired and I don't have the energy to stay up any longer. I'd love for us to try and find some time for us to catch up\" and then you both brainstorm ways to get an afternoon or evening without the kids to connect. If you don't communicate your needs, they'll never be met.", "Nta. He should have managed his time better", "NTA- that\u2019s a pretty entitled attitude from a man that got to do whatever she wanted, sleep how much she wanted, and have fun with his friends while you were home with two active children running ragged.", "INFO.\n\nDoes hubby look after both children for DAYS at a time?", "NTA - if my husband is out late he always tells me to go to bed, and makes fun of me for waiting up until he gets home.", "NTA. You did stay up- you weren't in bed, you were on the couch waiting for him and exhaustion took over. It happens. Weird of him to take that personally.", "NTA what so ever \n\nMy husband used to golf a lot when our children were young \n\nHe had a 9 handicap and we lived in Whistler where the golfing season was 7 months \n\n\nHe always came home to let me relax and get away from our children", "> he was hurt and upset that I didn't stay up to greet him\n\nINFO: does he think you're a labrador?", "He didn't want a \"greeting.\" He wanted sex.

As said above he would of wanted to spend some time with you after being away.\n\nBut u looked after 2 young kids for 5 days, that's hectic and very tiring, Tbh he should of left it aw damn that sucks, I wanted to catch up but not gotten hurt or proper upset by it cause u did him the favour", "That\u2019s  what I thought, too.", "NAH\n\nI understand he was probably excited to see you, so he was initially sad. But if he drops it now, nbd. \n\nYou are definitely not an AH. But he isn\u2019t really, either, for just expressing sadness that you didn\u2019t get to catch up.", "NTA. You have zero to feel guilty about. Had he told you BEFOREHAND that he wanted you bright eyed for him at the door when he came home, that's be one thing, but you were exhausted after being the only one watching the kids.\n\nHe's being ridiculous.", "NTA you obviously feel his reaction was unfair or you wouldn\u2019t have posted here. Let me throw in my support too. No you\u2019re NOT TA you\u2019re a tired mom he should respect that", "NTA. Does he think you're a fucking Labrador? Just waiting by the door for him to come home? Talk about self involved!!\n\nTime to book YOUR five day vacation, mama!", "NTA\n\nI travel for work and would never expect my partner to stay up for me. My schedule is my schedule. We work around it. That doesn't mean my schedule is *our* schedule. Even before kids, I still never expected her to stay up for me. If she's tired, then she goes to bed. Regardless if I'm sitting next to her on the couch, or in an Uber home. It makes no difference.\nYour partner wanted to feel important by having you disregard your own feelings to make sure you were awake to tell him \"I've missed you so much!\" when he got home after getting to go away and have a fun trip. \n\nIf he is fine getting nights off from parenting, then he needs to accept the outcomes of you solo-parenting.\n\nI hope after conversations he understands how unreasonable his expectations were.", "So the first thing he tackles when comes back is \"Oh honey, you were asleep and weren't able to tend to my wittle needs, boohoo!\"\n\nInstead of actually, oh idk, checking up on the kids, asking you on how taking care of kids all alone was, or even saying how his trip went and probably handing out souvenirs if he had some. No, all he wanted was me, me, me. NTA", "NTA. If I had a nickel for every time my partner came in the front door to find me asleep on the couch, I'd pay your first 3 months rent with 2 kids on your own. What a weird hill to die on. Try to feel that he really, really missed you and was so sad you didn't miss him as much because your kids are so much cooler than his friends. But he chose his friends and maybe if he learns his lesson next and you have patience for his learning process...next time he'll choose the kids.", "But... but... he wanted her to \"be with\" him! So take care of couple of littles all weekend and be available for sex when he returns from his boys' trip! Wassa matter with her? /s", "NTA. He needs to learn to recognise that you have your own needs too. Talk to him about it, tell him that its not because you didn\u2019t care about him, you wee just exhausted after taking care of the kids for 5 days by yourself.", "NTA\n\nTell him if he wants someone to greet him at the door, then he needs to get a puppy.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nIf he wants his spouse to do nothing than wait for him when he is gone and jump up in joy when he returns, he should have married a dog ;)\n\nI think he is just butthurt you didn't miss him as much as he thought, lol. And oc you should want to know about everything they did in detail immidiately when he comes home :) yk, like mommy back then when he came home from summercamp ;)\n\nYou are adults. Even if he returned from a six months research journey in antarctic it would be fine to wait till the next day to catch up.\n\nSometimes its just the mindset of the travellers, that all the ppl they left back home stop their lifes till the traveller returns home. Some ppl can't process the thought that life goes on for others, even if they themself are not around currently.", "Why do so many women put up with trash men like this? SMDH.", "NTA he is", "NTA. When you're tired, rest. When you're hungry, eat. What is this - the Victorian age? The 50s?", "I actually laughed out loud. You don't have 2 kids, you have 3. I can seriously imagine the petted lip on him.

However, it seems that he may have missed you and felt sad thinking you might not have missed him. Maybe he had an unrealistic idea of you excitedly greeting him when he got home. He may not have been thinking about what your time with the kids must have been like at the time. Again, you are completely not in the wrong.\n I think he needs to improve on how he processes his own feelings while taking yours into account and communicating them.", "NTA but why were you asleep on the couch and were kids in bed already at 8?", "NTA.  Looking after 2 kids of 5 and under is knackering work, whether you are having fun or not.  Your husband should cut you some slack here.", "NTA\n\nSo... he's...upset that you were tired if he isn't making a big thing of it the NAH he's just saying something that he didn't like but it doesn't seem like that so yeah nta", "NTA. You fell asleep on the sofa! You didn't even go to bed.", "NTA! You were sleeping on the couch, not like you were already tucked in in bed, and if you were\u2026well, good thing you\u2019re married and you have a whole week ahead to talk about all the amazing things you both did", "This sound very childish and selfish from him. Does he not understand that you are a human?\n\nWhat were you supposed to do? Take some drugs to stay awake?", "Why is that the assumption here nothing pointed to that lol. Men don't only want sex that's sexist. No OP isn't the  AH but let's not tell her \"your man didn't want to see you he  just wanted to use you for sex\" every man isn't a sexual predator.", "He can't just have wanted to see her? Yeah he's definitely the AH for getting upset but let's not assume he doesn't love his partner. Even if he was horny so what I'd want to get it in after being away from my man 5 days too lol. I don't think it was a sex thing tho yall be sounding bittttter."]}
