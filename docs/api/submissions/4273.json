NTA but I\u2019m wondering what the hell is wrong with your husband! This is absolutely not how marriage should work!", "NTA. Never have babies with a man this cheap.", "What\u203d NTA!", "NTA. You should rethink this marriage.", "NTA \n\nI'd be filing for divorce and moving out.\n\nIf your husband wants beer money, he can get a second job instead of charging *his wife* rent.\n\nIf you're really sold on staying married to this guy who wants to profit off your work, then see if you can get back into the office.", "I think that it's completely fair for you to pay for the use of the room. Of course, if you are renting a room from him, you will need a contract so make sure you get that. Also an agreement on bills should be in the tenancy agreement. I would suggest that you also need to look at the chores you do and set an hourly rate for them. Doing the dishes? Awesome. Took 30 minutes at $20/hour so that's $10 right there. Cooking is obviously more highly skilled than doing the dishes so at least $30/hour for that.\n\nAs he considers the marriage transactional you should too.\n\nNTA in case that wasn't clear but your husband sure is.", "NTA. The property (whether bought before or after marriage) chosen as the marital home is usually considered marital property. Half of it is yours, though I would double check that with a law in your area.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, you can tell him you own half, and if he wants to save this marriage and not watch you walk away with half the value, then he can go to marriage counselling with you and he can stop being an AH trying to make a profit off his own wife. \n\n*IF* you want to save the marriage.", "What the actual fuck? And he calls it \"his property\" ??", "INFO- If you are married, aren't your earnings from work going to both of you anyways?  It's community property (meaning it belongs to each of you) where I live unless their is a written agreement saying otherwise (and so is the house).", "NTA\n\nTell him you're going to go start going back into the office to work so he can stuff that 30% malarky. Unless he somehow thinks he deserves that as well.\n\nAlso, since it's *his* property, he can damn well do all the chores himself.", "Has your marriage always been this transactional? NTA. Your working from home will only save your \"family\" money in the long run that can be reinvested into your household. Your husband is being unreasonable and shortsighted.", "NTA. Your husband is being unreasonable. If he really wants compensation, he can claim the square footage of the room as a business for annual taxes.", "I am gifting my fianc\u00e9e half the house I own. YMMV.\n\nNTA", "Oh boy, If he's doing that you have much greater problems than money.  Part of being married is it's \"all for one and one for all\".   I'm not sure what state you live but if it's Florida, you already own half the house.  It's NOT just his anymore.   The day you moved in as his wife you became 50% owner (Florida), LOL.  I imagine other states have comparable statues.   \n\nSo he would feel better if you paid him to rent the extra room, yep, you have a much greater problem.    It needs to be addressed quickly.    \n\nBest wishes!!    Sorry to learn of your concerns.", "NTA, go find a space to work in that isn\u2019t your home. He is acting out of pocket. Is this a partnership or not? He\u2019s not acting like it is.", "Charge him for sex.  NTA", "Definitely NTA. If we were to pretend this is a reasonable ask...I'd like to know, how did he get to 30%? I doubt actual businesses are spending 30% of their operating costs on office space.", "NTA. You're his WIFE not his lodger.", "NTA also RED FLAG RED FLAG RED FLAG", "NTA. He has lost his damn mind.", "NTA. Tell him how much it costs for a live-in maid and cook (average salary for a maid alone is $26000-$42000US), and that he would have to declare that 30% as revenue for tax too. Now, bedroom activities, that\u2019s up to you. Also don\u2019t forget to factor in superannuation, insurance for you and leave entitlements.", "Is this out of character? Are there only specific rooms you're able to use? Are your chores seen as payment for living in his property? Why do you love him? NTA\n\nEdit: is he a gambler?", "What the actual FUCK??\n\nTell him to stick the house up his ...\n\nAnd use the 30% on a divorce lawyer.\n\nIt's absolutely clear that he doesn\u2019t respect you, He doesn't see you as an equal.\n\n*\"he pitched a fit and accused me of \"taking full advantage\"\"*\n\n\"You're taking full advantage\"? **YOU'RE HIS WIFE...... WTF is he talking about?**\n\nDIVORCE this clown!!!!\n\nNTA, You deserve better than this guy.", "NTA. Run don\u2019t walk get out of this marriage now.", "Tell him if you pay, you want to be on the deed.", "NTA - something is seriously loose in his head to think this is the way a partnership works. I think there is more at play here.", "NTA, I would also refuse this 30% he is demanding and either going to a coffee shop or library and working from there and then sending him a bill for household services. You both really need to look into how you are handling your joint finances equitably. Perhaps you do provide him 30% on the agreement that the you retain 30% ownership of the house you both live in.", "NTA. Why are those husbands always getting their moms involve in marital issues?", "NTA - His statement suggests he does not view your marriage as equal partners. He comes across as controlling and unreasonable. I am still shocked by his ask.", "NTA but take over half the bedroom then with your desk and computer since your paying enough for your half.", "NTA\n\nWhat in the screaming fuck? You pay half the bills, do the chores, the room was empty, it's a marriage, and he wants 30% of profits you generate? No.\n\nBut I'm confused. But the other room was just empty and everything packed into just the one? Did you mean two *bed*rooms?", "NTA - Don't pay a penny. You're already doing all of the household chores. He's already getting way more than 30% profits with that deal.", "NTA. Sounds like you need to get a place of your own. It's one thing if you aren't married, after marriage though? OP, get outta there.", "What? You already pay half of the bills he wants more. Does his work charge for his office space? That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous, you\u2019re NTA. I get that it\u2019s his house but you guys are married, not roommates.", "NTA\n\nYou're not his ROOMMATE ffs. You're his wife! It's a shared space.\n\nKinda greedy ass did you marry?", "NTA. I\u2019m puzzled at his logic and how separate he considers everything. You\u2019re married, and you live there, and you already contribute to the bills as well (as you should). Wild.", "INFO: IS he always this much of an AH to you? Why do you stay with someone who treats you like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA and you should put your foot down right on his ass for being one.", "NTA I've never heard anything so daft!!! You live there...you are both married!! I bet he's been stashing money away that you don't know about.\n\nHe sounds a right charmer!", "NTA.\n\nWhen you make dinner tonight, ask him for $20 for his food.", "Your husband sounds like a money hungry thief. Start charging him for cooking, cleaning, going grocery shopping, bedroom activists, etc. When he ask why well it\u2019s your body you should get paid since you could be using it for different things.\nNTA", "NTA Divorce that AH & get your own space", "Maybe you should move out of \"his\" home for a while; see how he feels about that.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWut da faq?  Your husband is insane", "NTA and......WTF????\n\nLet me get this straight... you are *married* and he wants to... make a profit off his *wife* ???\n\nI'm not the type to tell people to leave,  divorce,  etc.  but in this case,  I'll make an exception.", "I don\u2019t wanna be one of those Redditors that\u2019s tells a complete stranger to get out of their relationship but please get out of this relationship. There\u2019s just no universe that it\u2019s okay to treat someone you love like that. He\u2019s treating your marriage like a financial transaction and I encourage you find the love you deserve.", "NTA. You two are married.", "NTA. Wow.", "NTA, such a weird thing to demand of your partner. This probably gets worse.", "NTA\u2026stop cleaning for him", "NTA. Find a local area building that you can rent a room from. I guarantee it'll be less than the 30% he's asking; or, give him a counter offer of him paying you for your billable hours for doing the chores around the house, retroactively.", "Run! Just Run! His belief that there is this division of property in your marriage is bizarre. Should you send him invoices for cleaning \"his\" house or cooking \"his\" meals? He is hiding things from you and doesn't see you as his equal.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like much of a partner.", "NTA- but I don\u2019t understand why you would ever marry someone like this.  Just because he bought the house before you doesn\u2019t give him a right to make money off of you or treat you like a tenant.  That is basically the relationship you have why would you marry into this?", "Maybe maybe maybe could slightly understand if he asked you to pay rent for the room.  You guys are married though why is he looking to profit from you?  What kind of marriage is this?  Was it arranged?  Sounds crazy.", "NTA. Get that divorce girl. This is crazy and being cheap isn\u2019t cute. YUCK!", "Nooo, it has to be for all, it is HIS property afterall", "Or tell him she wants to make 30% profit on what she does of his round the house. \nOP NTA but I would be running for the hills your husband is being unreasonable and verging on controlling.", "I mean, it is *his* house. I have no issue there. But you don't charge your family. That's just wrong.", "Bill him for the sex too! Make life a fun transactional game since he's so focused on money.", "I think it's because most people find good partner and some poor unlucky ones end up with someone like OP's Husband\n\nNTA", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry but this is now how loving relationships are supposed to be", "Then, she stops doing all the chores because it\u2019s his house. He can cook, clean, do laundry. Wear and tear on a property because she is using a spare room to wfh? Pfft!", "She said there\u2019s no mortgage though, so there isn\u2019t anything other than general bills to pay for. Assuming bills also includes any maintenance that comes up, there\u2019s literally 0 reason for her to essentially pay him rent for her HOME office.", "She said she\u2019s paying half the bills.", "In the post, she says she pays 50% of bills.", " It's just a financial agreement to him.", "As a see it; Him involving his family is least of her problems now!", "Seriously. What a stupid thing to say. NTA", "She says in the post she pays 50% of the bills and there's no mortgage, and he's asking for an additional 30% of her income... OP is not TA but her husband is.", "OP did say they already pay 50% of all household bills, on top of doing ALL of the housework and working. So I definitely wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re paying for nothing, they\u2019re contributing an even amount in money and saving their husband a fortune in either energy or money on domestic labor.", "And take the house in the divorce", "Agree with separate your money from his immediately.", "This 100% this. \n\nNTA", "My thoughts exactly! :)", "I want to upvote this so much", "They both benefit from OP working. I sincerely don\u2019t understand the husband\u2019s stance.", ">*Do you charge him for sex*?\n\nStart negotiating, OP.", "She stated that he bought the house before they were married, so probably not community property, but still WTF! Def doesn't sound like a couple. NTA", "She should request a salary for being the live in housekeeper for his property.", "Yes, exactly. I would not want to live with him after this. Or be married to him. NTA", "Oh no, I'm not disputing that, nor would I expect him to put OP on any kind of housing documentation, considering that if the relationship broke down it would get sticky real fast.\n\nHowever, it sounds almost as if he's throwing it in OPs face, which is incredibly odd given that they're married.", "It\u2019s his house but it\u2019s *their home* - both of them.", "Depends on the state - some consider it community property if she's paying the bills for a period of time (which she is). Every state (if this is US) has different variations of property law or so I understand.", "Yeah, very weird way to treat your spouse.\n\nIn California (where I live) though, unless the house was fully paid off prior to them getting married, she would have acquired at least a partial equity interest in the house if any mortgage payments were made using community funds.", "Id present an invoice for all chores carried out since moving into the property.", "Yup"]}
