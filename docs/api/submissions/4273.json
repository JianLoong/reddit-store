I\u2019m a fairly well credentialed financial analyst (mostly corporate financial instruments). The \u2018finance\u2019 answer is you take a market rent for the whole place, figure out how much of that belongs to each room (accounting for common space), and then the market rent would be based on that. Say his mortgage is $2.5k. But market rent is $2.0k. It\u2019s 2 beds plus common space so say $800 per bedroom plus $400 for the common space. Your maximum cost should be $800/mo in that scenario.  The cost of renting an office has nothing to do with your work income or with his mortgage.  Plus you can probably get a coworking office for $500/mo. So your BATNA is part of this too. Tell him it was going unused before so you\u2019ll chip in an extra $150/mo. Or you\u2019ll just rent your own place at market prices. \n\nWhat do 1 bed apartments and 2 bed apartments rent for near you? \n\nThat, plus he\u2019s being a giant ass. I own my building. It\u2019s 2 condos.  My gf and I live in one of them. 3 bed 2 bath. She doesn\u2019t like using market rent as the starting point, so we agreed to split the cost portion of my mortgage.  Mortgage is $3,300 but $1,100 is principal. $2,200 is tax deductible for me so that becomes $1,500. Estimated maintenance $500. Total cost $2,000. We then split it based on income 75/25 and have equal use of the whole place (each of us have our own office, shared bedroom, shared common spaces). \n\nIf he wants to own the building, and you\u2019re okay with that, then that\u2019s fine. But he needs to realize that he\u2019s wielding a nuclear warhead and waving it around. If you get more than 50/50 use of the apartment, maybe it makes sense for you to pay a bit more of the hypothetical rent than him. But he shouldn\u2019t be going around giving edicts about what percentage of your income he has a claim on. That\u2019s just absurd.
