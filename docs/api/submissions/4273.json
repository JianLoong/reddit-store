My ex husband had to pay me for half of the house that he had bought prior to us even dating let alone marrying. But once we were married the state put me on the deed therefore I owned the house just as much as he did. Once we divorced I didn\u2019t want the house nor his money but the judge made a decision about the payment amount at the end.", "dependent on jurisdiction, my husband bought the house we live in before we were married, it\u2019s now marital property and if we divorced i would be entitled to half", "Depends where they live, if it\u2019s used as the marital home, it is usually considered marital property. It may be protected if it wasn\u2019t used as the marital home or a prenup is in place.", "Nice", "Yup. And looks like she does 100% of the housework. NTA", "Yup. You do all chores - going rate is $25 (at least) an hour for all chores including meal planning, grocery shopping, laundry, etc. \n\nDeduct the BS rent from that and he\u2019ll owe you quite a bit a month for what you do for him.", "Maybe she could put up one of those naughty *menus* like are seen in ancient Pompeii, with different prices for different things.", "I would love to see her just send a business PayPal invoice. Not friends and family one but a business one", "Surge pricing \ud83d\udcc8", "And like any good business, recall any reason is potentially valid for refusing an obstinate would-be customer service for the well-being of the employees.", "an aged rhetoric designed to play into the out-dated idea that sex is something women do to appease men.", "Yep.

I dont understand how people cant see that.", "How about a PowerPoint that links to a spreadsheet with colorful charts and graphs?", "Or keep doing the chores and bill him the same amount he would charge you for the office.", "It's called financial abuse.\n\nGet your financial ducks in a row (get copies of every financial document you can think of), keep all your decisions to yourself, and move out of **his** house as fast as you can.\n\nStart interviewing divorce lawyers who specialize in high conflict divorce, and be specific about the financial abuse. Document it all!\n\nGood luck, and be safe **OP**!", "Or he\u2019s just a greedy AH who s looking to squeeze every dime out of the situation he can.", ">consider separating ~~finances~~\n\nThis is a control thing. \u201cIt\u2019s my house\u201d LOL sir you are married, that is a equal partnership or it is *nothing*\n\nOP deserves better", "OP should get her own checking account without his name on it and start saving all she can. He doesn't like her getting her financial independence. Once OP pays her half of bills, and gives him the 30% salary fee for the spare room she has nothing left. This is how OP's husband wants it.\n\nOP should not let herself be put into that situation as he will further abuse her.", "You can't be evicted from a marital home.", "Depends on where they live. In a lot of places, roommates aka lodgers (someone renting or staying in a room) don't have the same rights vs a tenant renting an apartment.", "ehhh, if it was purchased outright prior to marriage, i dont know a single state that would do this. If it was purchased with a loan and marital income was used to pay the loan post-marriage? Then yeah definitely split.", "This is exactly why I\u2019ll have a prenup if I ever have a partner move in with me.", "Adding on to your point. I think it can differ by state in the US some states also use a time limit to decide if things like houses or companies are considered shared property. In my state (Illinois) I believe all property becomes shared property after 10 years.", "In at least some Canadian provinces they have common law marriage laws, so they wouldn't even need to be married.", "$25 an hour is for a cleaner who comes and goes. He has a live in bangmaid - they need an ongoing salary.", "Our cleaning service is $35 an hour in the Midwest\u2026 it was $40 when we lived in California.

The landlord would be bleeding them dry. NTA", "Actually this is a really good suggestion because it would involve very little paperwork.", "No, bill him at the current housekeeping and maid rates, which are higher.", "I'd charge the going rate for the chores you do. You clean up, whats a house cleaner cost a month? Cooking the meals, what's the cost of a chef? Outdoor work, landscaper? \n\nIf you want to go over the top, pull a Lysistrata, or find out the going rate for a prostitute (I dont actually recommend this unless you are willing to let go of the relationship because this is a nuclear option).", "BRAVO!  I was going to say the same thing since he wants to turn his marriage into a transactional arrangement.", "Even better, do the chores but find out how much local cleaning companies charge for office cleaning, and charge him that amount.", "So financial abuse", "Right?
