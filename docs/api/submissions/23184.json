No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before.\n\nRecently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk. \n\nMy wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work.\n\nI won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f\\*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.\n\nWhen I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely \\*insane\\*. Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1690385198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a8ue3/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wife_after_she_blew_up_my/", "score": 611, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife was worried that you could have been killed and you\u2019re upset that she was *checks notes* concerned about you? Do you not understand human emotions? She was panicking. She wasn\u2019t thinking about your possible promotion, she was thinking that you could be seriously hurt or even dead. All she wanted to do in that moment was hear your voice and hear it tell her that you\u2019re okay and that you love her and you\u2019ll be home safe. But instead, when she finally does, she hears it berate her and call her dumb. \n\nThat being said, your employees are the biggest assholes going. Your place of work is on fire and they don\u2019t say \u201chey, go let your loved ones know that you\u2019re okay\u201d. Who wants to work for psychopaths?", "YTA, holy fuck she was concerned for your safety. Also, just have your phone on silent and then it won't matter how many times people call or text you.", "YTA what the hell is wrong with your boss?

You need to grow a pair and have him remove that citation.", "Never seen somebody more YTA.\n\nYour annoyance was understandable because you didn't know the situation, and even when you found out, it's hard to go from 60 to 0 instantly.\n\nBut the second you found out what was up, you should have at least known intellectually that you were wrong.\n\nMeaning, it's mindblowing that you even have to come here and ask this question. SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. IT WAS A REASONABLE CONCERN.\n\nSo what if she overreacted? So what if she made some logical errors in her panic? She cared about you.\n\nDoes any part of you want her to care if you're dead? Also, have you been tested for any kind of mental/emotional issue that may account for you completely missing something here?\n\nAnyway, it may help your situation to tell your manager why you were getting so many calls, and if the manager has a heart in their chest, maybe that will make a difference.", "> There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk.

She's just a woman who was justifiably panicked about your safety. \n\nApologize,  profusely. \n\n(And turn your phone off instead of DND if your boss is going to be such a prick)", "Yes YTA and so is your employer\n\nIf something happens to your wife or daughter how the fuck would they reach you ? Would you make your little scene because you got called about it too ?\n\nShe was stressed, and crying, she panicked for a good time but no, instead or reassuring her you took your frustration out on her and think a half felt sorry will change something. She's right to be pissed, she cares about your safety and she might feel like you don't care about hers now.", "Actually, your workplace is the AH here.  So, your phone was ringing in a locker.  Big deal.  \n\nAs for your wife, she needed to be reassured you were okay.  She could have handled it differently, but in her panic of thinking you'd been hurt I suspect she was not thinking clearly.

Good god, your poor wife.  On so many fronts.  \n\nYour employer is also a giant ass.

She was crying for your sake and you went nuclear on her. \n\nJobs can be replaced but loved ones can\u2019t.

She thought you might be injured or worse. Calling 20 times in such a scenario isn't insane, she was panicked, it's a human reaction. She had no way of knowing that calling that many times would cause such an issue. Frankly, knowing the circumstances, I'm appalled that they wrote you up for this. You could not have been the only one there with a panicking loved one on the outside. People *died* in this incident. Try to put yourself in her shoes, would you be like \"oh well, let's assume she's still alive and go on with my day\"? I suppose she could have tried the office number but maybe she didn't have it handy?? Or she just wasn't thinking straight. Calling her dumb over this is beyond callous of you.", "Do you care about your wife's feelings? She felt panic thinking something happened to you...but of course because your shitty boss yelled at you at work you feel the need to continue the chain of aggression and take it out on your wife.\n\nLook at the big picture here. Your lucky enough to have a wife that cares so much about you. Don't punish her for your work's shitty policy. YTA", "YTA she saw on the local news that your work place was in flames and you weren\u2019t answering. She was worried for your well-being and you snapped at her for worrying about you. I\u2019d have explained to your boss the situation and all would be peachy keen. You have to remember that she was not with you and although it may be annoying to have that many phone calls,  the media often doesn\u2019t give all the details when things are first released! \u201cMore details in a few hours\u2026\u201d", "Would you prefer for your wife to hear the news that a building you sometimes work in burned down and there were casualties and think, \"Well, he puts his phone in his locker so I'll just wait and see if he comes home rather than see if my husband is alive. No big deal if he burned to death and I don't find out for a few hours more. He has anger issues and isn't respectful of my feelings so maybe it wouldn't be the biggest loss?\"", "YTA. Do you realize how heartless this post sounds? You're her husband and the father of her child, and she had legitimate reason to believe you could be either dead or seriously injured. Of course she called you repeatedly. And what does she get for her loving concern? To be shouted at and called dumb. I understand being upset, but frankly that reason should've mollified you. You heard your wife crying and terrified, with justification for calling, and you still made her feel like shit about it. You are definitely the asshole.\n\nOh, and it bothers me that your first reaction to seeing you had *twenty* calls from your wife was to be angry. If my loved ones knew they weren't supposed to call me and I saw twenty missed calls from them, I would've been worried. To me, that would've been a sign that something was wrong or something bad had happened to one of them. Your first reaction wasn't concern for your wife (or potentially your daughter) but to be pissed off.", "YTA \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t work in that location all the time- you still do sometimes. \n\nYour wife was worried for you **rightfully** so.

Like you, i cannot answer my phone at work. So, when I first went back after maternity leave I stuck my work number on the pin board in the kitchen so my husband can always get hold of me. \n\n\nThe good news is the next time something like this happens hopefully your wife will have wised up enough to how cold and unpleasant you are that she will be blowing up the phone of your life insurance company instead of you.\n\n\nYTA.", "YTA she thought you died man!

She didn't think about your phone going off in your locker and didn't think about contacting the front office (or maybe she did and they were too busy with other people calling to check on loved ones), she was concerned and worried about you. You're also TA for leaving your phone on and just using do not disturb without realizing there are settings for certain people or certain number of repeat calls to override it for cases of emergency. You could have turned your phone off, put it on silent, or used airplane mode, all three would block 100% of noises.

Normally I'd say that it's your workplace that is at fault here because once the fire happened, they should have informed all employees and allowed you to contact family.

No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before.\n\nRecently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk. \n\nMy wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work.\n\nI won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f\\*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.\n\nWhen I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely \\*insane\\*.

After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.\n\nShe was in panic mode because she was terrified she might get some of the worst news in her life.

She was worried for you and just tried to make sure and this is your response? Have some shame.", "If you were dead, did she think you'd come back alive after 20 calls?

Damn, how can you be so insensitive!  She thought she had potentially lost her husband and the first thing you think of is how it hurt your chance for a promotion?  Do you HEAR yourself right now?  Your factory job is replaceable, there\u2019s literally no end to the number of linemen being hired on a daily basis\u2026hell, tell me what state you\u2019re in, I might be able to hook you up with a new job from some contacts at my last job!  That said, how did you not have an emergency contact method planned in advance?  Your wife should have known to contact HR at your job site, that\u2019s day-1 stuff, man!  Also, on you to have informed her and provided that alternate contact info!  YTA, no buts about it.", "Holy shit of course YTA she was worried about your safety", "YTA. You wife was scared you were DEAD! And you yelled at her for being worried and you\u2019re still mad at her? Seriously, you are the worst of the worst. She deserves better.", "YTA for sure, how could you not understand your wife's reaction was normal and because she was worried about you? Even if she knew you're rarely at the secondary job site, that's not zero. Yes she might have called the office instead but she was panicking. Plus who knows if she would have gotten an answer, I'm sure lots of people called the office after the news about the fire   \n\n\nAnd your manager (and your company) are major AHs too. First, you didn't break any rule, you had your phone in your locker set on DND, its not on you, so why should this cost you a raise or promotion?

Why are they all so pissy about it?", "But it hurt his chances at a promotion!! I mean how freaking dare she!!!???\n\nAlso - what the f kind of place doesn\u2019t have an emergency process to get in touch cos they ban phones otherwise?  What if this had not been his wife, but that his wife had actually been in trouble and this was an EMT!??? WTAF!??", "Exactly! And what employer is still forbidding cell phones? Everyone has one and if on silent shouldn\u2019t be disruptive.

I would be seriously hurt if I was OPs wife, though.", "People died and the boss somehow had time to be concerned about someone\u2019s cell phone making noise???\n\nGuess there\u2019s no one to chew out if a dead employee\u2019s cell phone was noisy? Gotta take it out on our remaining living employees?", "i agree, the workplace is def the biggest asshole in this situation. if you know there was a fire at one of your locations that was big enough to make the news, you tell your employees to take 5 minutes to call their loved ones to let them know they're ok. it's basic human decency", "I can understand not being allowed to have it on you if you\u2019re working around sensitive information or proprietary processes, but what kind of place writes someone up for a phone ringing in their locker??  \n\nThat being said, if OP wife truly made 20+ calls, that\u2019s also excessive, she knows he doesn\u2019t have access to his phone at work. I\u2019m sure she was worried but after a few calls you either have to wait until they are able to get back to you, or it\u2019s time to maybe call the place directly to try and get information?", "It wasn't the place I was working at. It was a secondary jobsite an hour away. Plus the news coverage and her calling happened maybe an hour after the place went up in flames. People in my building who knew about it right away were concerned about things more important than sending a messenger down to all of us.", "When I see I have that many missed calls I don't get annoyed. I get scared something is wrong and they are trying to get ahold of me to let me know.", "While I agree that OP is TA, I am also wondering why the company is sanctioning someone for having their spouse call as they saw news about a serious accident at the plant.  TF kind of soulless company is that.   So, OP's manager is also TA.", "The fact he wrote she knows he don\u2019t work at that secondary site very often.

How dare she call him to see if he had been hurt or worse?", "Agree with everything, but we also need to add OP\u2019s boss to the asshole list. Writing someone up because their phone is going off, no matter the reason, is wild. Standing behind said write up after finding out that it was just a concerned family member making sure that the person they love is still alive (after one of YOUR buildings caught on fire) is next level assholery.", "Not the case, my kids have called my phone when I had it on do not disturb and it still buzzed. I am guessing he has an iPhone and if a favorite contact calls 2 or more times the phone considers it an emergency and starts to buzz after the second time. It's all about timing I think it is if you call within 10 seconds of each other.", "I will add a TA to the company though too.  Employees should have been told to report in to family on their breaks.", "The post explains that phones have a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d function so that repeated calls ring.

If someone calls right back it rings through. He\u2019s have to actually turn it off.", "I agree, however I know that phones these days can still go off after a certain number of calls even if they are on silent. He should have just turned his phone off.", "He literally says he was on Do Not Disturb and that her calling overrode it.", "She should have called the office at that point though,no? She knows he doesn\u2019t have the phone on him.", "Brother you ever heard a phone vibrating in a metal locker? It\u2019s loud as fuck that doesn\u2019t fix the issue.", "If she was so concerned, why didn't she call the office? He said she could have.", "Exactly. OP is taking his frustration out on the wrong person. His wife is NOT the villain here, it\u2019s the heartless management at his company that didn\u2019t even think to let their employees give their loved ones a heads-up that they were ok. There were injuries and casualties, for God\u2019s sake.", "Also, what if the emergency had to do with something else, like their child? The reaction to 20 calls should not be anger and annoyance, it should definitely be, holy crap, something happened! Because, you know, things (emergencies) happen when you're at work! And honestly, I don't like places with a no personal devices policy. I get that they don't want people to be playing candy crush all day, but we have lives outside of work. People need to be reachable for situations like this.", "In my opinion he should go to HR and tell them what happened and ask how can any employee's family find out if the employee is OK if something like this happens again. Then he can ask his boss if they were aware that a site you occasionally work at had a major fire with a lot of people hurt and how can your family verify your safety in that situation? If family can't call your cell then who can they call to check on your safety? \n\nPersonally I would be updating my resume and checking on what other jobs are available, this company is not very employee friendly.", "Boss didn\u2019t know what was up with the noise, only that someone\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t turned off and making a racket big enough someone complained!  I\u2019m guessing OP didn\u2019t tell boss why wife called after the fact either\u2026just so many wtf\u2019s to get through.", "Not only that..his FIRST reaction to seeing so many back to back missed calls was to be annoyed and angry.... even if he didn't know about the situation.. WHY wouldn't his first thought be that SHE may have had an emergency herself..or a loved one? \nEspecially when he stated she knew not to call..any logical person would know.. there must have been a valid reason....", "Even not knowing about the fire, he said he has a daughter. If i received 20 calls in a row from my spouse, my immediate thought would be there was something wrong with my child, not that the spouse was annoying.", ">Also, have you been tested for any kind of mental/emotional issue that may account for you completely missing something here?\n\nIt might be the culture he lives in. Look at how uncaring, unforgiving, and unaccepting his bosses are.", "Right??? If something serious happens at my workplace and my husband knows about it, he better call me repeatedly and worry/care if I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m concerned about OPs lack of understanding basic human emotions", "Op may indeed be the AH. But come on. His wife went crazy, called him 20 times, punched through the DND and got him in trouble. I know I would be a bit pissed if that happens. This does not make his anger in the right. But he is not a total AH.", "Did no one else read the whole thing?? SHE COULD HAVE CALLED THE OFFICE PHONE.", "If he was dead, what good would blowing his phone up have done?", "Honestly, how was he able to post this and expect any other response...", "One time my mom cooked me in a shower because I was sick. The idea was that the hot water would make me feel better or something. I kept telling her it was too hot, but she ignored me. I ended up passing out, and when I woke up I was lying in bed and my mom was sobbing over my body. Not for a moment did I feel resentment or anger towards her, nor did I think she was dumb for feeling that way (even if I wish she hadn\u2019t boiled me like a lobster). I don\u2019t understand how you can be faced with a loved one crying and get mad at them. As soon as OP heard his wife sobbing on the phone, he should\u2019ve been overcome with worry. If not, because you can\u2019t always control your emotions, he should realize that he was wrong in retrospect. But no, he acted like a huge asshole and doesn\u2019t even regret it. What a d canoe. I hope his wife is never in a serious accident, because it doesn\u2019t sound like he would care to check, since she\u2019d be \u201cunavailable\u201d", "Also, what if he\u2019s pinned down or injured by a result of the fire and not accounted for?\n\nSounds like management is horrible, so not trusting them to know he\u2019s unaccounted for.

Your employer sucks, OP", "I can't count how many times my phone went off (silently) at my desk during the home-buying process for group calls with my partner, realtor, and in-laws (helping us understand the process).

A couple of days I told my boss \"I normally wouldn't do this, but this is a key moment and I may need to step out for a call.\" His response - \"this is a huge moment in your life, I'd be mad if you didn't\"\n\nAny boss worth their salt can understand context", "Any manager worth their salt would refuse to write up in this scenario.", "The employer is a massive massive AH in this situation to the point it seems illegal", "OP is really working hard to make that past tense.", "[removed]", "Agreed.

Yeah, someone people cannot think logically in a life or death situation, and others can. His wife thought he might be dead and panic set in. It makes sense to me.\n\nAlso, the fact that OP never gave his wife the office phone number; he expected her to Google it herself. So factor in more time in trying to find the right phone number to be connected to the right office to connect to the right person who could get OP in the first place and....yeah, I see how the 20 calls happened before the logic.", ">if there's an emergency I call or text ONCE and ask him to respond ASAP. \n\nWe get it - you're fine with assuming your husband is dead after one missed call and not trying a follow-up when his office literally burns down", "You know a life insurance policy doesn\u2019t make a dead husband come back right? Shocker, but some people actually care about their spouse and not just money.", "Yeah. I\u2019m really disturbed by the \u201ca few casualties\u201d \u201clots of injured\u201d. If this is a secondary worksite then those are coworkers, even if you don\u2019t know them very well and there is that chance that it could have been you and your family affected, have some empathy. OP seems to be brushing this off which seems weird to me. But management definitely had bigger concerns than a phone ringing in a locker. Maybe the write-up happened before OP knew it was his wife trying to make sure they were ok, but seriously what manager is concerned about a phone when people died?", "Exactly, instead of blaming his wife for being concerned OP should talk to the manager or HR bc it was an emergency.", "> so why should this cost you a raise or promotion?

My spouse works in a location where they can\u2019t have their phone, so when I need to contact them I call the office number.

If the husband had turned his phone off (the rule for my spouses facility) he wouldn\u2019t have gotten in trouble, but she also would not be able to get ahold of him.

He\u2019s still an asshole.", "Absolutely... I feel, OP should explain the situation to his boss/manager/hr or whereever necessary and this should be cleared", "More likely for just being a prick. No need to expand on the possible reasons why.", "And there were a few casualties, so not just a minor incident. I'd be looking hard to get out of there.", "That\u2019s possible. But then it was on OP to put his phone on silent or turn it off. He\u2019s not allowed to offload his responsibilities to keep company policy to his wife whose concerned.", "So if you put your phone on Do Not Disturb you're an asshole on the off chance that someone calls you twenty times and overrides it. Sure. \n\nCall him an TA for his reaction to his wife, but seriously don't pretend that's he's idiot for using Do Not Disturb. Especially if you aren't willing to judge the wife for calling 20 times in a row and expecting an answer.", "Yeah, past trauma makes me unnaturally calm in crisis these days.", "Worry yes, panic no. \n\nI'd explore other contact options before giving in to panic. Worry is the waste of an otherwise healthy imagination.", "Yeah, it\u2019s strange OP got written up. As a manager whose employer owns a building that was *literally on fire,* wouldn\u2019t you expect calls to be coming in? Or let your employees use their phones briefly to let their families know they\u2019re okay? \n\nI may be expecting too much from a corporation, though. My mom was at work once when a tornado warning came in and her boss wouldn\u2019t let them leave. The tornado ended up hitting the building and peeled the roof off completely. (Iirc, everyone was okay.) \n\nGranted, it may have been worse if they weren\u2019t able to get somewhere safe in time, but it was pretty evident that the company didn\u2019t care about their employees and their safety.", "No, a lot of people do not miss that at all. They understand a brain thinking in panic because someone believes their actual love is dead. \n\nAnd the fact that repeated phone calls like that from a loved one means something is wrong, and no one should be written up for it.", "As I said to someone else, I'm assuming this isn't like something he hid from her, just something NEITHER of them thought about until this situation arose. \n\nSome people think about those emergency situations more than others.  \n\nReminds me of when I went to college.  I thought my grandmother was crazy because she asked me to get her my roommates parent's number (this was pre cell phones).  I was like \"you don't know these people\", but she rightfully figured that if something happened and she couldn't reach me and no one was in my room, that could be a logical person to contact.", "My guess is that its something neither of them thought about prior to this.  That isn't anyone's fault necessarily.  I'm sure he didn't like hide the number from her or something.", "[removed]", "What does it have to do with OP's wife? Just because you're calm doesn't mean others are or that it's unreasonable.", "Calm isn\u2019t necessarily the best thing to be in a crisis.\n\nAt some of the most deadly fires (nightclubs, casinos, etc.) people calmly stayed where they were thinking it was a small manageable fire until a flashover killed them. I\u2019m sure some of the people killed in the second tower on 911 calmly stayed at their desk instead of evacuating when they had the chance. \n\nPanic is never good, but that doesn\u2019t mean calm always is.", ">He is an idiot for using DND, turning the ringer down is easier and has no override.\n\nNitpick.", "I asked what good blowing up his phone was, because he got reprimanded at work for it. \n\nLeave a message and wait until EoD, or call the facility to ask if your husband is at that site just aren't choices most people consider, it appears.", "Thanks for your candor!", "Not really, but keep saying that to yourself if you need to.", " I understand you have past trauma but we are emotional creatures.", "Not all people think logically when they panic. You think your loved one died and you wait? That's not what most people do and his wife has to Google the number for his company according to OP's comment. Why didn't he gave her the number from the beginning when smartphones aren't an option? Again, she was in panic and didn't think straight. \n\nThe work place sucks - what if something happend to wife and daughter?", "Yeah I don\u2019t think waiting was going through her head when she was worried her husband was trapped in a burning building and dying/already dead. Have you considered your past trauma has affected other things than just you being calm in crisis situations? Because this is so out of touch", "What you describe as yourself being \u201ccalm\u201d is doing the right thing, which is being in the moment and not getting distracted by your emotions and the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. \n\nI just wanted to point out that sometimes part of that IS taking decisive action, not necessarily being passive.", "Cool. I'm just speaking out to say I see OPs point.", "I can agree with you, I'm just offering an explanation that doesn't make OP TAH immediately, because some people work differently.", "Therapy has been good to me, but crisis triggers calm.\n\nI'm just saying that while OP overreacted, I can see why he'd be confused about her panic.", "I appreciate your further explanation. Thank you!"]}
