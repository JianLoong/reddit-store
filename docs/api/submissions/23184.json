No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before.\n\nRecently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk. \n\nMy wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work.\n\nI won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f\\*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.\n\nWhen I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely \\*insane\\*. Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1690385198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a8ue3/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wife_after_she_blew_up_my/", "score": 3763, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife was worried that you could have been killed and you\u2019re upset that she was *checks notes* concerned about you? Do you not understand human emotions? She was panicking. She wasn\u2019t thinking about your possible promotion, she was thinking that you could be seriously hurt or even dead. All she wanted to do in that moment was hear your voice and hear it tell her that you\u2019re okay and that you love her and you\u2019ll be home safe. But instead, when she finally does, she hears it berate her and call her dumb. \n\nThat being said, your employers are the biggest assholes going. Your place of work is on fire and they don\u2019t say \u201chey, go let your loved ones know that you\u2019re okay\u201d. Who wants to work for psychopaths?", "YTA, holy fuck she was concerned for your safety. Also, just have your phone on silent and then it won't matter how many times people call or text you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards!", "YTA what the hell is wrong with your boss? We have an employee\u2019s spouse, who is legitimately and reasonably concerned that her their husband has been critically injured, and he\u2019s penalizing you? You need to grow a pair and have him remove that citation.", "Never seen somebody more YTA.\n\nIt's mindblowing that you even have to come here and ask this question. SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. IT WAS A REASONABLE CONCERN.\n\nSo what if she overreacted? So what if she made some logical errors in her panic? She cared about you.\n\nDoes any part of you want her to care if you're dead? Also, have you been tested for any kind of mental/emotional issue that may account for you completely missing something here?\n\nAnyway, it may help your situation to tell your manager why you were getting so many calls, and if the manager has a heart in their chest, maybe that will make a difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ETA:** You didn't even know that lots of calls could override a Do Not Disturb setting, and yet you're holding your wife responsible for knowing it.\n\nIt's your job to put that setting on when you're at work. You did that. And I'm betting that since it's SOOOOOO important that your phone not ring at work, she probably knows you do that.\n\nToo bad you had to learn this way, but if your setting worked the way BOTH of you expected it to, 20 calls would not be a good reason to \"half-yell\" at your loving wife.

Would you make your little scene because you got called about it too ?\n\nShe was stressed, and crying, she panicked for a good time but no, instead or reassuring her you took your frustration out on her and think a half felt sorry will change something.

Big deal.  \n\nAs for your wife, she needed to be reassured you were okay.  She could have handled it differently, but in her panic of thinking you'd been hurt I suspect she was not thinking clearly.  Forgive her and apologize for yelling at her and not thinking how this affected her.  Work out how she will handle getting information if another such incident should occur.", "YTA.  Good god, your poor wife.  On so many fronts.  \n\nYour employer is also a giant ass.

Places that dont allow personal devices should   provide alternate ways to contact in case of emergencies\n\n\nEven after you knew why you were still an ass\n\nYour workplace was wrong for not involving the employees and then writing you up when you had a loved one concerned about it", "YTA \n\nYou and your employer. \n\nTry to put yourself in your wife\u2019s position. Since the phone kept ringing (which I\u2019m not blaming you due to the company\u2019s policy), she was assuming the worst. She was crying for your sake and you went nuclear on her. \n\nJobs can be replaced but loved ones can\u2019t. It looks your wife\u2019s priorities were coming from a good place and that\u2019s why she was worried.", ">She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker.\n\nI assumed you worked in a SCIF, but considering you don't know that most phones have a setting that allows repeat callers to get through indicates you don't work in a SCIF and you just have horrible management at your job \n\nYTA", "YTA. She thought you might be injured or worse. Calling 20 times in such a scenario isn't insane, she was panicked, it's a human reaction. She had no way of knowing that calling that many times would cause such an issue. Frankly, knowing the circumstances, I'm appalled that they wrote you up for this. You could not have been the only one there with a panicking loved one on the outside. People *died* in this incident. Try to put yourself in her shoes, would you be like \"oh well, let's assume she's still alive and go on with my day\"? I suppose she could have tried the office number but maybe she didn't have it handy?? Or she just wasn't thinking straight. Calling her dumb over this is beyond callous of you.", "Do you care about your wife's feelings? She felt panic thinking something happened to you...but of course because your shitty boss yelled at you at work you feel the need to continue the chain of aggression and take it out on your wife.\n\nLook at the big picture here. Your lucky enough to have a wife that cares so much about you. Don't punish her for your work's shitty policy. YTA", "YTA she saw on the local news that your work place was in flames and you weren\u2019t answering. She was worried for your well-being and you snapped at her for worrying about you. I\u2019d have explained to your boss the situation and all would be peachy keen. You have to remember that she was not with you and although it may be annoying to have that many phone calls,  the media often doesn\u2019t give all the details when things are first released! \u201cMore details in a few hours\u2026\u201d", "Would you prefer for your wife to hear the news that a building you sometimes work in burned down and there were casualties and think, \"Well, he puts his phone in his locker so I'll just wait and see if he comes home rather than see if my husband is alive. No big deal if he burned to death and I don't find out for a few hours more. He has anger issues and isn't respectful of my feelings so maybe it wouldn't be the biggest loss?\"", "YTA. Do you realize how heartless this post sounds? You're her husband and the father of her child, and she had legitimate reason to believe you could be either dead or seriously injured. Of course she called you repeatedly. And what does she get for her loving concern? To be shouted at and called dumb. I understand being upset, but frankly that reason should've mollified you. You heard your wife crying and terrified, with justification for calling, and you still made her feel like shit about it. You are definitely the asshole.\n\nOh, and it bothers me that your first reaction to seeing you had *twenty* calls from your wife was to be angry. If my loved ones knew they weren't supposed to call me and I saw twenty missed calls from them, I would've been worried. To me, that would've been a sign that something was wrong or something bad had happened to one of them. Your first reaction wasn't concern for your wife (or potentially your daughter) but to be pissed off.", "YTA \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t work in that location all the time- you still do sometimes. \n\nYour wife was worried for you **rightfully** so.

Like you, i cannot answer my phone at work. So, when I first went back after maternity leave I stuck my work number on the pin board in the kitchen so my husband can always get hold of me. \n\n\nThe good news is the next time something like this happens hopefully your wife will have wised up enough to how cold and unpleasant you are that she will be blowing up the phone of your life insurance company instead of you.\n\n\nYTA.", "YTA she thought you died man!

She didn't think about your phone going off in your locker and didn't think about contacting the front office (or maybe she did and they were too busy with other people calling to check on loved ones), she was concerned and worried about you. You're also TA for leaving your phone on and just using do not disturb without realizing there are settings for certain people or certain number of repeat calls to override it for cases of emergency. You could have turned your phone off, put it on silent, or used airplane mode, all three would block 100% of noises.

Normally I'd say that it's your workplace that is at fault here because once the fire happened, they should have informed all employees and allowed you to contact family.

No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before.\n\nRecently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk. \n\nMy wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work.\n\nI won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f\\*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.\n\nWhen I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely \\*insane\\*.

You for being angry with your wife and yelling when she just wanted to know you were okay. Your wife for calling your cell phone when she knows you can't have it on you and not calling your company to ask for information.

After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.\n\nShe was in panic mode because she was terrified she might get some of the worst news in her life.

Even if she knew you're rarely at the secondary job site, that's not zero. Yes she might have called the office instead but she was panicking. Plus who knows if she would have gotten an answer, I'm sure lots of people called the office after the news about the fire   \n\n\nAnd your manager (and your company) are major AHs too. First, you didn't break any rule, you had your phone in your locker set on DND, its not on you, so why should this cost you a raise or promotion?

Gotta take it out on our remaining living employees?", "i agree, the workplace is def the biggest asshole in this situation. if you know there was a fire at one of your locations that was big enough to make the news, you tell your employees to take 5 minutes to call their loved ones to let them know they're ok. it's basic human decency", "I can understand not being allowed to have it on you if you\u2019re working around sensitive information or proprietary processes, but what kind of place writes someone up for a phone ringing in their locker??  \n\nThat being said, if OP wife truly made 20+ calls, that\u2019s also excessive, she knows he doesn\u2019t have access to his phone at work. I\u2019m sure she was worried but after a few calls you either have to wait until they are able to get back to you, or it\u2019s time to maybe call the place directly to try and get information?", "It wasn't the place I was working at. It was a secondary jobsite an hour away. Plus the news coverage and her calling happened maybe an hour after the place went up in flames.

I get scared something is wrong and they are trying to get ahold of me to let me know.", "While I agree that OP is TA, I am also wondering why the company is sanctioning someone for having their spouse call as they saw news about a serious accident at the plant.  TF kind of soulless company is that.   So, OP's manager is also TA.", "The fact he wrote she knows he don\u2019t work at that secondary site very often.

How dare she call him to see if he had been hurt or worse?", "Agree with everything, but we also need to add OP\u2019s boss to the asshole list.

I am guessing he has an iPhone and if a favorite contact calls 2 or more times the phone considers it an emergency and starts to buzz after the second time.

It\u2019s loud as fuck that doesn\u2019t fix the issue.", "If she was so concerned, why didn't she call the office? He said she could have.", "Exactly. OP is taking his frustration out on the wrong person. His wife is NOT the villain here, it\u2019s the heartless management at his company that didn\u2019t even think to let their employees give their loved ones a heads-up that they were ok. There were injuries and casualties, for God\u2019s sake.", "Also, what if the emergency had to do with something else, like their child? The reaction to 20 calls should not be anger and annoyance, it should definitely be, holy crap, something happened! Because, you know, things (emergencies) happen when you're at work! And honestly, I don't like places with a no personal devices policy. I get that they don't want people to be playing candy crush all day, but we have lives outside of work. People need to be reachable for situations like this.", "In my opinion he should go to HR and tell them what happened and ask how can any employee's family find out if the employee is OK if something like this happens again. Then he can ask his boss if they were aware that a site you occasionally work at had a major fire with a lot of people hurt and how can your family verify your safety in that situation? If family can't call your cell then who can they call to check on your safety? \n\nPersonally I would be updating my resume and checking on what other jobs are available, this company is not very employee friendly.", "Boss didn\u2019t know what was up with the noise, only that someone\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t turned off and making a racket big enough someone complained!

WHY wouldn't his first thought be that SHE may have had an emergency herself..or a loved one? \nEspecially when he stated she knew not to call..any logical person would know.. there must have been a valid reason....", "Even not knowing about the fire, he said he has a daughter. If i received 20 calls in a row from my spouse, my immediate thought would be there was something wrong with my child, not that the spouse was annoying.", ">Also, have you been tested for any kind of mental/emotional issue that may account for you completely missing something here?\n\nIt might be the culture he lives in. Look at how uncaring, unforgiving, and unaccepting his bosses are.", "Right??? If something serious happens at my workplace and my husband knows about it, he better call me repeatedly and worry/care if I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m concerned about OPs lack of understanding basic human emotions", "Op may indeed be the AH. But come on. His wife went crazy, called him 20 times, punched through the DND and got him in trouble. I know I would be a bit pissed if that happens. This does not make his anger in the right.

The idea was that the hot water would make me feel better or something. I kept telling her it was too hot, but she ignored me. I ended up passing out, and when I woke up I was lying in bed and my mom was sobbing over my body. Not for a moment did I feel resentment or anger towards her, nor did I think she was dumb for feeling that way (even if I wish she hadn\u2019t boiled me like a lobster). I don\u2019t understand how you can be faced with a loved one crying and get mad at them. As soon as OP heard his wife sobbing on the phone, he should\u2019ve been overcome with worry. If not, because you can\u2019t always control your emotions, he should realize that he was wrong in retrospect. But no, he acted like a huge asshole and doesn\u2019t even regret it. What a d canoe. I hope his wife is never in a serious accident, because it doesn\u2019t sound like he would care to check, since she\u2019d be \u201cunavailable\u201d", "Also, what if he\u2019s pinned down or injured by a result of the fire and not accounted for?\n\nSounds like management is horrible, so not trusting them to know he\u2019s unaccounted for.

A couple of days I told my boss \"I normally wouldn't do this, but this is a key moment and I may need to step out for a call.\" His response - \"this is a huge moment in your life, I'd be mad if you didn't\"\n\nAny boss worth their salt can understand context", "Any manager worth their salt would refuse to write up in this scenario.", "The employer is a massive massive AH in this situation to the point it seems illegal", "OP is really working hard to make that past tense.", "[removed]", "Agreed.

Yeah, someone people cannot think logically in a life or death situation, and others can. His wife thought he might be dead and panic set in. It makes sense to me.\n\nAlso, the fact that OP never gave his wife the office phone number; he expected her to Google it herself. So factor in more time in trying to find the right phone number to be connected to the right office to connect to the right person who could get OP in the first place and....yeah, I see how the 20 calls happened before the logic.", ">if there's an emergency I call or text ONCE and ask him to respond ASAP. \n\nWe get it - you're fine with assuming your husband is dead after one missed call and not trying a follow-up when his office literally burns down", "You know a life insurance policy doesn\u2019t make a dead husband come back right?

If this is a secondary worksite then those are coworkers, even if you don\u2019t know them very well and there is that chance that it could have been you and your family affected, have some empathy. OP seems to be brushing this off which seems weird to me. But management definitely had bigger concerns than a phone ringing in a locker.

After that, it can let calls go through, you can set the number on iPhone at least", "Underrated comment here", "Do you understand  how happy I am that someone else knows about this.? Thank you.", "I\u2019ve a friend who was written for being late to work. His house was on fire and he didn\u2019t want to leave his family standing in the street at night watching their house burn. Amazing to me but he did actually go in after he got them situated. Work knew the situation but rules are rules.", "If he's american, I fully believe it.  I've worked for some folk who could only be described in terms that would get my comment deleted.  There's a not-insignificant contingent of management in the US that really *do* put the business first and either are actively hostile to employees or treat them like parts.", "That's fair, but you do have to expect loved ones to call when there's a workplace casualty, and any half decent boss would find a way to let his employees tell their families they aren't dead, even if it is during a shift.", ">Tbf certain jobs ban them for privacy or legal reasons (worked at a juvenile detention center, illegal to have any of those devices on you),\n\nTrue. However, those same places **also have plans in place in the event of an emergency**. I know when I was working in a no personal electronics place, the procedure was to contact a certain number (that was always monitored by a real person & not only voice mail). OPs indifferent attitude towards his wife's feelings has me wondering if he even told her about how to contact him.", "TBF his phone was on silent. He said her repeated calls started coming through because of how many times she called. My phone will do that too if I have that setting turned on.", "Yes exactly it's so unfortunate she didn't call the office but some people can't think at all when they panic.", ">sounds like OP never told her what number to call in an emergency which just makes him even more TA.\n\nI thought the exact same thing!", "Exactly, my spouse has a work location that he goes to sometimes where cell phones are banned. I have the emergency number. He gave it to me his first day of work.", "She does have his office number but was obviously too panicked to remember. Poor lady.", "And OP didn't even have it on his person.  It was in his locker!  That makes the boss even worse!", "Not sure how often  secure doc sites catch on fire, though.  I was thinking it was construction or something like that giant fire in Charlotte a couple months ago.\n\nThat said that DND function is the lamest way of avoiding calls.  I used to work in an MRI facility and I just turned my damn phone off before putting it in my locker.", "He should definitely be mad at them and not his wife, because yeah it\u2019s pretty ridiculous that he was written up for something that he couldn\u2019t control and also it probably wasn\u2019t negatively effecting anything anyway. Was there a group of people trying to work in the locker area and they needed silence? Like why does it matter that a phone locked in a locker was making noise? They\u2019re just being petty AHs.", "Oh he's 1000% TA. I wasn't trying to make excuses for him - I think he's lying about his write up and using that as an excuse for his behavior when it in fact makes him look even worse.", "Many phones have a setting where when the same caller tries to call you multiple times in a row, it will override dnd. It's actually super useful, but of course you can turn it off completely or only enable for certain contacts.", "That does in fact change things enough for me to call OP an asshole now.\n\nIt's an emergency, she shouldn't have to look around on Google to get into contact with OP.\n\nI was thinking OP had told her previously the correct way to get into contact with him.", "Yes, and now being aware of that, I agree that he's an asshole. I was under the impression that he had already told her and given her the contact info.", "I work in a cleared space.  My wife still has a number to a phone in my office in the event of an emergency.  Either she fucked up by forgetting this exists, OP fucked up by not providing her one, or OP's company is worse than we thought by not having one on the floor in the first place.", "Problem is he was automatically the AH when he said he yelled at her after than many missed calls. And I agree, no boss is writing someone up for a phone going off in a locker room, 1. It can\u2019t be heard outside of the room 2. His boss would have had to have taken the time to listen at every locker to pinpoint exactly where it was coming from", "How would they even know it was his phone? Unless the lockers aren't locked. In which case my phone would be in my car or I'd leave it at home. This doesn't make any sense at all. Time to go judge Judy on this guy. \"That's not what a normal person does. If it doesn't make sense, it isn't true.\" OP is YTA.", "Literally OPs manager: \"there was a serious incident at our facility and OPs phone was going crazy. Better write him up :) :) :)\"", "Besides, I assume that the locker the phone was in was together with many other lockers where other phones were in. How the f... did his manager know it was HIS phone that made all that noise since there must've been hundreds of phones ringing simultaneously because many people who love the workers of that company must've tried to contact their loved ones?", "It came over the news that a middle-aged blonde woman at my aunt's company was killed in an elevator accident while (we didn't know) she was at a doctor's appointment. You better believe she had a shit ton of missed calls when she got out of it.", "Exactly! Surely the response would be \"hey OP, we've just had this major incident and your phone has been ringing nonstop - we think someone is worried about you, why not get in touch with them?\". Part of me wonders if OP has exaggerated the employer's reaction...", "Ah, but what if the fire was caused by someone's phone ringing? Don't you feel foolish now? /s", "Or imaginary", "She had to watch it play out on the news!! Poor wife", "I assume it's Amazon, it seems to be normal there and the management response would fit.", "I'm starting to wonder if OP works for Cobra Command or Weyland-Yutani?", "Casualties can just mean injuries, though I don\u2019t know what exactly OP meant by it", "Agreed. I'd be calling HR as soon as possible", "I get the feeling OP is nervous about his new-ish job and being a slave to the man rather than being a human and sticking up for his wife in this moment. I doubt he even explained to his boss what the calls were for - maybe even downplayed it and made shitty comments about his wife to his boss.", "Imagine if his wife was calling because his daughter was in a bad car accident?  \n\nOh, sorry OP, your daughter died hours ago but your wife was told never to call you while at work.", "Good luck getting disciplinary citations revoked/recinded... nearly impossible in my personal experience.", "Yeah, this dude can't possibly be the only worker there whose family was worried about them. And I think a company with a deadly fire at their place of business should have a bigger immediate concern. I remember as a kid when the plant my dad worked at had an explosion, one of the first things they did was call all the workers together and say \"call your family to let them know you're OK.\" This happened despite the fact that it was over a mile from my dad's location.", "Nope, where my husband works your phone can get you fired.", "They don't give a shit..  Rules are rules", "Also the AH because he's the one who left the ringer on.", "My high school history teacher kept his political opinions very guarded EXCEPT for being super pro-Union and pro-strike. We spent a solid unit on strikes throughout history and this one and some railroad strikes had a significant impact on me and has stayed with me through the years.", "OP did say that he is not able to have contact with his wife from his cell phone during the day, so I would guess that if she called and didn\u2019t reach him (as she knew she wouldn\u2019t), rather than calling 19 more times, she should have tried the main line. They would have been able to give her the information she needed. \n\nHer feelings completely made sense in the moment, and she wasn\u2019t thinking rationally knowing how he is with his phone at work. \n\nThat being said, if your wife is crying and generally worried about whether you are dead or alive, you do not yell at her. This is a wake up call that they should create a plan they are both happy with if this were to happen again in the future.", "Right. My husband works with nuclear material in an underground vault. There is a landline number I can call in case of an emergency and they will get a message to him.", "He did say at the end that she knows he can't be contacted directly and could have just called the office. So it does sound like that's the plan in place in the event of an emergency. She chose not to do that, blow up his phone and bypassed his Do Not Disturb.", "That wasn\u2019t clear unless I missed a comment. He says she knows she could contact the office but *did he actually give her the number*? The numbers in my building aren\u2019t listed like you could just Google them or something.\n\nETA- he admits in a comment that she \u201ccould have googled the company and eventually they would have connected her to the right area\u201d so he definitely didn\u2019t say \u201chere is the direct line for emergencies please put this in your phone.\u201d", "Oh yeah I was just backing you up. His phone at work is 100% his responsibility regardless of who\u2019s calling him. Any other person in his life that didn\u2019t know his work rules and schedule could have had an emergency and called him multiple times. All on OP", "I agree that if she had been provided with an official way to reach him or the company out in cases of an emergency, the situation would be different.", "And continues as :\nEven though there were fatalities, his family should not have been overly worried", "Yes, like WTAF.", "Because everyone else turned off their phones because they have been written up before.", "Manager with his ear to each locker?  Manager is definitely an AH too.", "They probably had to chase down which one it was. That would have taken awhile.", "Yea. A plane crashed (everyone was fine) at the base my husband works at. Even *my* phone was blowing up with people wanting to know everything/one was ok. \n\nWhy the hell WOULDNT OPs phone be ringing ?", "I can't imagine. Then, as soon as she gets ahold of him, he's screaming at her. I would never call his phone again. \n\nYTA OP!", "But he didn't even work there that often!!! /s", "Seriously. Multiple casualties at another site and they not only don't tell anyone but also are spending their time writing people up for a phone ringing? Who are these people?", "Casualties means death", "HR should have had the common sense to be contacting peoples families since they don\u2019t let them has electronics in them. My guess would be that HR is so bad they would manage to make things worse", "HR is not your friend", "I bet he didn't even get in that much trouble either and is exaggerating it. If he just told his boss after that his wife heard about the fire and was worried I'm sure they would be absolutely ok with it and tell him to turn his phone off. I also bet his phone is supposed to be off or silenced like at a movie theater.", "He might be but in this economy, some people don't have a choice.  Let's scold him for being a dick to his wife, not speculate and dehumanize him for trying to keep a job when ten grocery items can hit 100 bucks quick af.", "There were casualties, though. An incident at one of their worksites let to the deaths of some people and serious injuries for many more. I suspect that the company has a lawyer that will tell them not to be dicks about that day.", "What kind of place has a rule that a phone can\u2019t ring? And actually writes someone up for *someone else calling their phone*??", "Agreed. All around AH.", "This is also why we have gore escapes and fire extinguishers now", "Anytime there is an incident or accident that my father has been in or could have been in, he calls us first himself. Doesn't matter how difficult it is, he calls us first to let us know that he's okay and what happened.

I got fired from a job because it rang after 5 p.m. which is when my shift ended, but was working late with a patient. My mom happened to call, because she thought I was off.

Maybe OP also works in a classified area or an area where outside tech is dangerous :)", "A place that wants to make sure the workers are afraid for their jobs.", "They are supposed to have all the electronics in their lockers silenced. But his only rang because the large number of calls overrode the Do Not Disturb setting, and OP only got that many calls because there was a fire at one of their worksites where a few people died and a significantly larger number of serious injuries. Now, the person who wrote OP up may also not yet have heard about the fire, but I do think it's a reason to cancel or modify the citation.
