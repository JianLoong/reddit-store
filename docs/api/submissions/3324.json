That's some deranged boundary breaching right there. They're denying your autonomy to a really weird level. It sounds like your in-laws - and your partner - need to understand that you're a person deserving of respect, not just a walking baby growing apparatus.\n\nYour husband is going to need to advocate for you throughout your pregnancy and labor - let alone when you're parents. Sounds like he's got his priorities wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why they think this behavior would be at all helpful to you. Maybe ask your OB for some backup? You shouldn\u2019t be bullied like that.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult. This is a weird (and frankly inappropriate) level of control they're trying to have over you...", "NTA, this isn\u2019t preschool. Your husband doesn\u2019t need a daily report of your eating through the day.", "NTA\n\nGranted, I've always been of a heftier build, but for the first 7 months of my pregnancy I lost weight before gaining a bit back the last couple months and have weighed less ever since birth than I ever did before it.\n\nI highly suggest smoothies, cucumbers, and muffins. The first two aren't bad coming up, the last one generally doesn't try to. Go slow, snacking lightly.\n\nNo one should be monitoring you like this! Stress is far more harmful to the baby and to you! And if your husband is allowing you to be bombarded and inciting their behavior, he needs to stop.\n\nYou can't force these things, and the more you try the more damage you'll cause.", "They need to leave you alone\n\nNta", "NTA as long as you and the baby are healthy your eating habits are none of their business.", "NTA. Your husband has no idea what it's like to be pregnant, particularly that first trimester with all the nausea and vomiting. It's awful. Coming from a currently pregnant person pregnancy is just miserable. So long as you're happy with what you are eating and that it's healthy so you and baby are getting what you need then they need to back off, they are going to give you an eating disorder if they keep it up.", "NTA. When I was pregnant with my oldest, I could not keep anything other than raisin bran down for the first 6 month.  I lost 20 pounds.  My ex husband would yell at me constantly for getting sick, and losing weight. He was convinced I was doing it on purpose so I wouldn't get fat.  I had a nurse yell at me for losing weight between appointments,  and a waitress lecture me for not eating more.  My daughter is almost 23 and all that has still stuck with me.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  Maybe sit down with your husband and talk to him about how this makes you feel.  Try to explain to him, that you lost weight not because you tried to, or wanted to, but because you were extremely sick.  I didn't know at the time, but I learned later that this happens with some women, and there is nothing you can do about it.  Explain to him, that how him and his family are treating you, will have a lasting affect.  I wish I could give you a hug, and tell you everything will be ok.  Just want to throw this out here, I haven't eaten a bowl of raisin bran in over 23 years, and don't plan on it ever again.", "NTA You are pregnant and some women have difficulty keeping food down when they are pregnant. Your husband and in-laws are treating you more like a child with an ED than an adult pregnant woman who is capable of regulating her own food intake as best you can. This kind of behavior that are exhibiting towards you sometimes makes for more issues as it can create stress and anxiety around eating, doing more harm than good. \n\nIs it possible to go stay with family or friends for a week to alleviate some of the stress and make a plan for how to address this issue around the food micromanagement?", "NTA. Treating people like this, even if they think they are concerned for your health, contributes to EDs and toxic relationships with food. You could try to communicate that their efforts have the opposite of their intended effect, if you haven't already. If you don't think you will be able to eat around them, and can tolerate it, also consider designating time to spend with them outside of meal time, so that they cannot accuse you of avoiding them.", "I hate when people watch or comment on my eating habits, and I\u2019m not even pregnant! Being pregnant is already such a vulnerable time, and I wish they\u2019d all realize how much this is probably stressing you out. You aren\u2019t an attraction at the zoo. Your husband and his family are being uncomfortably controlling in this matter, and are treating you like an incubator. It\u2019s weird and gross. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP. I hope you two can work through it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. They aren't respecting you and what you've asked of them. Concerned about your health makes sense, but you've made it clear what they're doing isn't helpful. I'd do the same thing. If they're going to keep bringing it up, then you won't eat in the same area as them. If they don't want you to avoid them, then they just need to stop.", "NTA no one needs to comment on your eating habits.", "NTA\nThat\u2019s super weird. I can\u2019t imagine being literally analyzed during every meal and then have feedback on it. Dear god", "Your in-laws need to back off and allow you to eat intuitively and be in control of your own diet. Pregnancy already affects your eating habits and this can sometimes lead to EDs. Their obsession with your food intake isn't healthy for anyone, least of all you. \n\nNTA, good luck for the rest of your pregnancy :)\n\n(Edited to add judgement)", "NTA. I'd bring everyone to my next OB appointment and let them have it with doc's backup. You acknowledge that you need to gain weight, but with the nausea it's hard. My niece threw up at least once every single day of each of her 3 pregnancies. Some women are just that way.", "NTA and this is so awkward and weird. I\u2019m not pregnant Zane never had an eating disorder but there\u2019s no way I could eat a meal with people observing me. Ugh", "NTA\n\nwhat do you mean your husband has to take time out of work to eat with you?", "NTA. Perhaps it would be worth asking mom and SIL to visit a OBGYN physician who will assure them for some women its completely normal to be constantly nauseous and unable to keep anything down - esp during the first and 2nd trimesters. But if that's not possible, I think you should continue to do exactly what you're doing, you don't need the stress and anxiety they're adding to your life and hubby needs to understand that.", "NTA during pregnancy its actually recommended to eat less portions more frequently through the day. You eat what you can and move on. They should not be micromanaging you and your eating habits, they should just be supportive of whatever you think you need. They can't force you to eat more because they think you need it, they're not you. You need to be very, very clear that you won't be taking unsolicited advice or policing on habits at all, during or after pregnancy (I wonder how often you'll hear about how you're not feeding the baby enough...) If they continue to critique you, share reports on what you are or aren't doing to judge if it's \"enough\", and try to bully and coerce you into what they want and think is best, you might want to reconsider being around them as a whole.", "NTA OP and I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. They and your husband are WAAAY overstepping. I had hyperemesis gravidarum with baby 2 and severe nausea with my other 2 throughout pregnancy. Just make sure to follow doctors orders and you will be ok. \n\nPeople who haven't gone through it don't understand the frustration and helplessness and guilt that comes with not being able to eatand hold food down. This controlling bullshit that your husband and inlaws are doing can trigger pre and postnatal anxiety and depression. Please tell your Dr what they are doing and if necessary have the doctor talk to your husband. Please know you're not doing anything wrong.
