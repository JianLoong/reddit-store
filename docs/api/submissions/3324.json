I couldn't eat anything. Literally nothing. And those first three weeks, neither of the other two hospitals could place a feeding tube. By the time I was rushed to the last hospital, they had already figured out what was wrong using the same scans from the previous hospitals and had a feeding tube placed within two hours. I had that tube until two weeks prior to my c section and only gained 7 pounds the entire pregnancy. It was miserable. I would have lost my damn mind if my MIL and SIL behaved like yours have.

It was so super painful, like a ball of barbed wire scraping my insides. It would literally feel like my insides were trying to turn inside out. It seemed everything would go backwards. I'd eat something and instead of it going southwards during digestion, it would exit hard northwards. I'd be a complete, shaking exhausted mess. So, my brain started associating eating with extreme pain. So, I just didn't eat. Got so darned skinny, I looked skeletal. The doc threatened a feeding tube. I went to a nutritionist who understood dialysis and it took about 9 months for me to get sorted out. This was after an ileostomy reversal. I have a crap ton of trauma to my insides and the nerves that normally tell your gastric system how to work are all FUBARD. My motility is 65% of a normal person's. Which means I now eat about 6 to 8 really teeny tiny meals. Sometimes, I take a bit or two and I am completely stuffed.\n\nYou're pregnant. All kinds of things are happening inside your body. There's a tremendous amount of strain being put upon your kidneys, bladder, and your heart. Not to mention your gastric system. With that being said, I urge you to DEMAND that your doctor run a full kidney and endocrine panel on you. The blood work is not that expensive, but it can tell them if you're having any kind of an endocrine imbalance that might be acerbating things. Pregnancy is a dangerous time for a woman in terms of gestational diabetes and kidney failure.\n\nNext, Hon, Boost clear is delicious over ice. Kiefer is awesome for settling down a gastric system that is having epic tantrums. So is yoghurt. Bonus, it is nutrient dense. If you can't tolerate the taste of Kiefer or yoghurt, there are things like nuts, eggs, and a whole host of nibble foods that are packed with protein and nutrients that you can utilize in what I call the 1 bite and done method.  I myself love those little envelope packets of Tuna because I can open one, put it into a bowl, take an everything Ritz cracker, put some on it, nibble and put the rest in the fridge; then rinse and repeat as I am doing chores. My daughter thinks I am weird because I'll have a hard boiled egg and a sweet pickle while I am getting ready for work. Point being, I manage to down about 2000 calories in a day doing that. Just taking a bit or two every hour or so. I've maintained my target weight for dialysis, my blood work is on target and bonus, I can eat.\n\nTalk to your doctor about a referral to a nutritionist that has experience with pregnancy related dietary issues. Contrary to popular belief, you do NOT need to eat a traditional 3 course meal at every sitting. You can \"graze\" and still get your required calorie intake, pregnancy and all.  But, you are going to have to insist that your husband goes with you to the nutritionist appointments and that he opens up all of his listening skills and has an open mind. Then, he is going to have to understand that once all these things are sufficiently explained to him, he is going to have to tell his folks to BACK OFF! If he cannot do these things and is insistent that you do your eating \"his way\" and \"his parents way\", then, Hon, you have bigger problems than just pregnancy induced gastric distress.\n\nWorst case scenario, if your husband won't listen to your needs and your doctor(s) about it, then you may need to seriously consider leaving for the rest of the pregnancy and going to stay with a trusted family member or friend. This, to me, is an absolute deal breaker, because I went through something similar with my husband before he died. He thought that it was perfectly acceptable to eat a diet of hotdogs, potatoes every night and basically ignore my renal diet because he didn't like it. He didn't want to listen about how what he wanted to eat all the time would literally KILL ME. My doctor, in a fit of exasperation, told me that I needed to divorce him if I wanted to live out the year. I was seriously considering it, before he died.\n\nSometimes, no matter how much you love someone, friends, family, whomever, they can and will cause you serious harm, to the point of threatening your very survival. At that point, they cease to be people you should have around and it's better to remove yourself from their access.  \n\nYou have some serious  decisions to make. Start with blood work for a full kidney and endocrine workup. Consider a GI specialist. Consider looking into things like Boost clear and nutrient dense foods that you can nibble. Get a nutritionist.

It was so super painful, like a ball of barbed wire scraping my insides. It would literally feel like my insides were trying to turn inside out. It seemed everything would go backwards. I'd eat something and instead of it going southwards during digestion, it would exit hard northwards. I'd be a complete, shaking exhausted mess. So, my brain started associating eating with extreme pain. So, I just didn't eat. Got so darned skinny, I looked skeletal. The doc threatened a feeding tube. I went to a nutritionist who understood dialysis and it took about 9 months for me to get sorted out. This was after an ileostomy reversal. I have a crap ton of trauma to my insides and the nerves that normally tell your gastric system how to work are all FUBARD. My motility is 65% of a normal person's. Which means I now eat about 6 to 8 really teeny tiny meals. Sometimes, I take a bit or two and I am completely stuffed.\n\nYou're pregnant. All kinds of things are happening inside your body. There's a tremendous amount of strain being put upon your kidneys, bladder, and your heart. Not to mention your gastric system. With that being said, I urge you to DEMAND that your doctor run a full kidney and endocrine panel on you. The blood work is not that expensive, but it can tell them if you're having any kind of an endocrine imbalance that might be acerbating things. Pregnancy is a dangerous time for a woman in terms of gestational diabetes and kidney failure.\n\nNext, Hon, Boost clear is delicious over ice. Kiefer is awesome for settling down a gastric system that is having epic tantrums. So is yoghurt. Bonus, it is nutrient dense. If you can't tolerate the taste of Kiefer or yoghurt, there are things like nuts, eggs, and a whole host of nibble foods that are packed with protein and nutrients that you can utilize in what I call the 1 bite and done method.  I myself love those little envelope packets of Tuna because I can open one, put it into a bowl, take an everything Ritz cracker, put some on it, nibble and put the rest in the fridge; then rinse and repeat as I am doing chores. My daughter thinks I am weird because I'll have a hard boiled egg and a sweet pickle while I am getting ready for work. Point being, I manage to down about 2000 calories in a day doing that. Just taking a bit or two every hour or so. I've maintained my target weight for dialysis, my blood work is on target and bonus, I can eat.\n\nTalk to your doctor about a referral to a nutritionist that has experience with pregnancy related dietary issues. Contrary to popular belief, you do NOT need to eat a traditional 3 course meal at every sitting. You can \"graze\" and still get your required calorie intake, pregnancy and all.  But, you are going to have to insist that your husband goes with you to the nutritionist appointments and that he opens up all of his listening skills and has an open mind. Then, he is going to have to understand that once all these things are sufficiently explained to him, he is going to have to tell his folks to BACK OFF! If he cannot do these things and is insistent that you do your eating \"his way\" and \"his parents way\", then, Hon, you have bigger problems than just pregnancy induced gastric distress.\n\nWorst case scenario, if your husband won't listen to your needs and your doctor(s) about it, then you may need to seriously consider leaving for the rest of the pregnancy and going to stay with a trusted family member or friend. This, to me, is an absolute deal breaker, because I went through something similar with my husband before he died. He thought that it was perfectly acceptable to eat a diet of hotdogs, potatoes every night and basically ignore my renal diet because he didn't like it. He didn't want to listen about how what he wanted to eat all the time would literally KILL ME. My doctor, in a fit of exasperation, told me that I needed to divorce him if I wanted to live out the year. I was seriously considering it, before he died.\n\nSometimes, no matter how much you love someone, friends, family, whomever, they can and will cause you serious harm, to the point of threatening your very survival. At that point, they cease to be people you should have around and it's better to remove yourself from their access.  \n\nYou have some serious  decisions to make. Start with blood work for a full kidney and endocrine workup. Consider a GI specialist. Consider looking into things like Boost clear and nutrient dense foods that you can nibble. Get a nutritionist. If necessary, remove yourself from your inlaws access,\n\nGOod luck.", "I came here to say this.
