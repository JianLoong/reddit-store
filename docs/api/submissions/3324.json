ESH", "NTA Even if something is unhealthy, you have bodily autonomy. You told them to stop doing it and they keep doing it. They brought it on themselves. And your husband is also an asshole for putting pressure on you.", "NTA but this sounds like HG. If you haven't already there is help. Medicine and IV nutrition are available.", "NTA\nSo he stopped getting his reports on what you\u2019re eating and decided to take time off to come sit with you and watch you eat? That\u2019s also uncomfortable. The in-laws behavior is not great, but the husband sounds like a problem. I don\u2019t want or need anyone having that much oversight over me and what I eat. Pregnancy is odd in so many ways and it\u2019s counterintuitive that just when you need the food more your body is rejecting it. Sounds like a lot of those issues have passed, though? The other thing is that you will eat what you need. As long as you\u2019re making an attempt to keep healthy food coming in, that should be enough. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Husband and family need to back off.", "NTA, people commenting on your food intake is rude and inappropriate even in normal circumstances but \\*while you're eating\\*? FOH. Why isn't your husband standing up for you against the in-laws when you ask them to stop?", "They are treating her like an incubator. Plain and simple.", "OP You Are NTA!!  Please pay extra attention to this thread of replies to your post!!  Get a visit with your doctor ASAP drag your husband to the visit and tell him/her about the added stress you are feeling because of what your husband and in-laws are doing to you. Be very clear that you are aware of the need for nutrition for yourself and your unborn child. Get whatever medication you can from the doctor to help with your very severe morning sickness problems. And then get your doctor to make darn sure that your husband knows that he and his family need to back off! They may think that they are being caring, but they are being far more of a problem than a solution.", "It's absolutely more stressful for someone to monitor what and how much you're eating when pregnant while already having an issue with being nauseous and uncomfortable. Please stop worrying about them and what they think and focus on you. Tell your husband the same and he needs to relay the message to his mil and sil", "Banana blended into milk worked good for me.", "Some families really do see women as life support systems for a uterus, and it's Rosemary's Baby scary.", "Aww. The bucket needs a smily face and some Googly eyes. Thanks, bucket", "I lost 4kg. Could only eat small portions of beige food.", "FYI, if OP's answer had been \"Yes,\" she'd still be NTA. Surveilling / reporting / bullying regarding food consumption is an excellent way to trigger or worsen an existing ED if there is one.", "NTA. This is very weird. They are acting like you are CHOOSING not to eat, which makes zero sense, because everybody knows that nausea and vomiting are common during pregnancy. They are acting like you are a rebellious teenager with an eating disorder who needs to be monitored (which doesn't even help rebellious teenagers). I do not like this.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t understand why he needs to take time off work to eat with you?  He wants to know how much you eat that badly?  What??", "NTA,for clear reasons\n\n\n\nBut, on side note pls be careful I mean if u r pregnant then u need ur nutrition so maybe consult ur doctor", "Why can't you just tell them all to stop bugging you?\n\nNTA, what a poisonous environment you're living in.", "Honey, I didn\u2019t eat or drink a drop of warer throughout my first trimester. I lost 15kg and had to be hooked the the saline to avoid organ failure. I had a severe case of Hyperemesis where I  couldn\u2019t even keep down a single drop of water.\nIt felt horrible when people pestered me to force feed myself. \nBut you know what? My eating habit didn\u2019t affect the weight of the baby. Your husband is treating you as a womb and not as a human being.\nIf I were you, I would tell him that he can make the decision about your body when he is carrying the baby", "Ummm NTA, also 2  important things does a doctor know about this. It case your child and you are getting enough nutrition. Also are your in-laws doing this out of concern or drama. If they are concerned it would be worth forgiveness, granted only from a sincere apology.", " NTA it\u2019s degrading and controlling. They are putting you ahead of the baby. The stress they are giving is harming you and the baby more than helping", "NTA. I refuse to eat with my mother and I'm not pregnant, she just won't STFU about how little I eat at a time, or I haven't touched that delicious liver she overcooked for me because it's my favorite*.\n\n*By that she means her favorite.", "I feel like you're missing a fair amount of vital information here, how bad is \"bad\" when you weren't eating much/at all in the beginning of your pregnancy, this could just be a massive overreaction because they saw what \"can\" happen if you reverted to your ways at the beginning and want to make sure you and the baby are as healthy as possible.", "NTA. It sounds more like husband is upset he isn't getting an annual report from his mother about how much you're eating.\n\nDoes your doctor know and what have they said about the matter of your eating?", "NTA. Are they going off their backs to tell him, or did he ask them to let him know? It seems to me that it\u2019s more your husband than them. He must be pretty concerned if he\u2019s got to the point he\u2019s taking time from work to come and eat meals with you.", "NTA. I would start doing the same thing to them. Every time they have a meal or a snack, I'd verbally announce 'Great job eating all your food' and then go around the house and rave about how well MIL and SIL are eating. But I'm petty. I had psydo cysts incasing my pancreas in my last pregnancy,  took three weeks and three separate hospitals (the last one being 5 hours from home where I spent months and underwent 3 surgueries) to figure out what the problem was, all the while screaming and blacking out from unbearable pain. I couldn't eat anything. Literally nothing. And those first three weeks, neither of the other two hospitals could place a feeding tube. By the time I was rushed to the last hospital, they had already figured out what was wrong using the same scans from the previous hospitals and had a feeding tube placed within two hours. I had that tube until two weeks prior to my c section and only gained 7 pounds the entire pregnancy. It was miserable. I would have lost my damn mind if my MIL and SIL behaved like yours have. It's like they don't realize any added stress and pressure makes it even harder to try and eat, meanwhile you're mentally tearing yourself apart because you know you need to eat, gor both you and baby, but you have no control over it. It's debilitating and depressing and terrifying. OP have you tried shakes/protein drinks like ensure? If not, give them a try. Even just getting one or two down a day at a slow pace can make a big difference and will help you maintain protein and calcium, which that human you're growing is actively 'stealing' from your body. I hope things get better for you. Pregnancy is hard enough as is, being treated like a child isn't going to make things any easier. Best of wishes to you and your little one. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you move out?", "NTA, you are more than a uterus on two feet, you also have a BRAIN that is aware how, when, and how much to eat to keep you and your baby healthy.  I understand  that the others in your household are concerned,  but it is misdirected, because  you can take care of this matter yourself.", "NTA\n\nAll that their behaviour is achieving is making you feel self-conscious and upset every time that you *do* eat. Not only are they out of line, the are actively impeding you from improving your eating habits.", "Ive had insane levels of morning sickness through all of my pregnancies. With my last one I had huge aversions AND sickness \u2026 and yet still managed to put on weight! Baby was born very healthy. \n\nThey\u2019re really not helping issues at all with how they\u2019re behaving. It\u2019s kinda creepy how obsessed they are with what she\u2019s eating. \n\nNTA", "Also pureed apples! It's pretty gentle on the stomach.\n\nI'm only almost 15w5d but have lost 5.5kg so far. My weight has remained roughly the same over the last month. I'm sure I'll gain weight later on, but right now I just can't eat that much! \n\nOP (NTA btw) should listen  to their medical practitioner and ignore the in-laws. They're not being helpful.", "Exactly! Your husband should tell his family to stop monitoring you.", "The irony is that their behavior is precisely the type of thing that causes ED on people, they're constantly associating food with anxiety and shame.", "Even then I wouldn't call her an AH, because when someone is that out of touch with reality its beyond their control \n\nI feel like in order to be an AH your actions must be deliberate *and* you need to have the capacity to know better", "Tell your husband the same and he needs to relay the message to his mil and sil", "Is it possible to go stay with family or friends for a week to alleviate some of the stress and make a plan", "Exactly. It's so insulting. The husband should support her instead of the in laws. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why they think this behavior would be at all helpful to you.", "My mom always had me drink sweet tea for the same reason, tastes about the same coming up and it's cold"]}
