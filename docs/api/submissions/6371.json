I waited for my husband to come back home and told him everything. He said \"he'll handle it\" I asked him if that means Anya is uninvited and he said no but he will find an appropriate punishment.

That is a separate issue that your husband needs to deal what. You cant expect your FIL to not invite HIS GRANDKID to a trip HE PLANNED. You have taken this too far but posting this on social media. Why did you even do that? That\u2019s such a immature thing to do.", "YTA\u2026this isn\u2019t your vacation, your FIL can invite who he wants and he\u2019s inviting all of his grandchildren. \n\nAlso, way to make it about you and put it on Facebook.", "YTA. \n\nAnya's bullying of Ella is absolutely not okay and should be handled, but you are the bigger asshole in this scenario by deciding that the only appropriate punishment is to disinvite Anya - your FIL's biological grandchild - from a trip that you're not even paying for. \n\nAnd putting all of this on social media? You **seriously** put a 14 year old on blast on social media? You should be ashamed of yourself.", "You really don\u2019t see how wildly inappropriate it was for you to contact FIL and ask him to uninvite his own grandkid from a trip *he* is paying for? You did that without even speaking to your husband first.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nYTA", "YTA and delusional for thinking your demands and social media posts were going to help you in any way. Nothing of what you did addressed the actual issue or will make life better for your daughter.", "You say \u2018we\u2019 have two kids, but from what you write it sounds like you and your husband have one kid (your bio daughter), and your husband has a kid who you tolerate and refuse to parent at best, but also who you actively bully/exclude and publicly humiliate on occasion. You\u2019re not just a bad parent, you are an abusive one. \n\nIt amazes me that you\u2019re surprised Anya thinks bullying is acceptable - after all, she\u2019s just copying your behaviour. \n\nYTA, and I hope that your husband gets you out of his daughter\u2019s life ASAP before you do any more damage.", "YTA, you're FIL paid for everything, so he essentially has final say.  Perhaps instead of trying to get your stepdaughter uninvited from a family trip, you should all be sitting down as a family to try to talk through and resolve the issues, maybe try therapy.  Also, it's pretty classless to be posting that type of stuff on FB.", "YTA. You don't get to decide the punishment for someone else's child. So YES you are wrong for your expectations, and total AH for overstepping and dictating this situation with your in-laws. You would not want your husband punishing your child behind your back?!!!  Shame on you!  Your husband is the ONLY one who decides what punishment is appropriate for HIS child. You let your anger drive you and you are crossing boundaries.", "YTA\n\nThe bullying is not okay. I want to make that clear.\n\nBut you don\u2019t get to decide that the punishment is that she can\u2019t come on a trip organised by her FIL for the entire family. And you ESPECIALLY don\u2019t get to decide that without her father on board.\n\nAnd the Facebook rant? Uncalled for. And childish. But with the karmic benefit of demonstrating to all how entitled you are. So well done on playing yourself, I guess.", "YTA. You did answer your own question since you are two strangers to his family and you expect them to choose you.  You should let your husband or the school or as a couple handle it as a family.  It\u2019s immature to make Facebook posts and not expect a reaction.", "YTA.   Anya's behavior isn't okay. Your expectation that your FIL uninvite his granddaughter is also not okay.  You can't expect other people to uninvited people from an event when it's important to them to go. All you can do is not go yourself.  Your FB post crossed a line too.  Your only recourse here is not to go.\n\nYou reacted in such a \"NO WAY\" way.  You could have used it as a teaching moment.  I know it's hard. That age involves a lot of bullying and not wanting to subject your daughter to it makes sense.   But your way of dealing with it made it worse even for your daughter", "Yta, I get protecting your daughter but a public Facebook post and asking them to uninvite her is beyond ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nIf nothing else than for the Facebook post.

Why are you imploding your family this way? \n\nIt\u2019s your in laws\u2019 trip and and they have every right to have their grandchild there, and you can\u2019t turn a 14 year old off a trip the week before (her mother might have made other plans!) - plus it\u2019s the wrong thing to signify for the success of your blended family that she will be turfed out of family events for bad behaviour.\n\nI understand you\u2019re motivated from a good place trying to protect your daughter and her mental health. But you\u2019ve actually detracted from fixing her problem with your outrageous overshadow. That\u2019s assholery!", "YTA-you should have started with husband. If you didn\u2019t get the response you wanted, you should have then removed yourselves from the trip if you felt that strongly about it. I actually think you made a huge mistake. The girls probably could have really learned to get along on this trip under the supervision of the adults. You definitely don\u2019t get to put an ultimatum on FIL about his own granddaughter, and you were definitely wrong to put this entire situation out on FB. You\u2019re trying to bully your family members into doing what you want and that\u2019s worse than your step-daughter, because at least she\u2019s actually a kid. You\u2019re and adult and acting like a kid.", "YTA.\n\nThe bullying is not okay.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ve only been married for a year. How much has your daughter interacted with her step grandparents?\n\nThe fact that she and you were invited in the first place was a huge step in including you in the family. It wasn\u2019t something they had to do. To take that gratitude and shove it in their face speaks volumes.\n\nThe proper steps here were to deal with this with your husband and come to a decision together, with the knowledge that you may have to make steps on your own if you didn\u2019t like the outcome.\n\nYou are married to a man who has a daughter that bullies your child and with whom you disagree when it comes to handling the situation. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s sustainable to begin with, but I\u2019m especially unsure after you put his entire family on blast for having a family vacation.\n\nThis whole situation is a mess.", "Some nerve you have to call a child\u2019s grandfather and ask him to uninvite his granddaughter.\n\nYou went to Facebook about it? How old are you?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou aren't paying for it, your FIL is and Anya is his biological granddaughter, so of course she is going to take precedence over you and your daughter.\n\nIf you don't want your daughter around her, don't go. If you don't think your husband will put a stop to the bullying, don't go.", "This really the hill you want to die on? Punish Anya by withholding a trip and diminishing the chance at improving relations with her? How will that change her behavior towards Ella? And going onto social media to rant about it? Looks like you still have some adulting to do. YTA.", "YTA. I totally agree that Anya is a poop and your husband needs to address her behavior. However, I put you in AH territory for three reasons:\n\n1. It was unrealistic to expect a grandparent to boot his granddaughter from a trip he planned and paid for.\n\n2. Posting about it on Facebook was weird and immature.\n\n3. Keeping your daughter away from her stepsister will not solve the problem. I understand wanting that in the short term so she can get some space but, long term, they are family now. The goal should be to address the root issues so they can have a healthier relationship.\n\nYou should either skip the trip or go and see if you can use it as an opportunity to work on the relationship between your daughter and stepdaughter. A trip away from their peers and supervised by you and your husband might not be a bad thing.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have talked to your husband first (not FIL) and let him handle it.  You jumped the gun and became judge jury and executioner all at once.  And do you really think the other family is going to uninivite their own blood grand-daughter for the angry mom and step kid? \n\n Double YTA for going to SM.\n\nThe punishment for Anya, assuming there is something there to punish for, is a separate issue, don't involve the IL's extended family in this.", "YTA, big time. *And* you made a post on Facebook? Good lord, how old are you, 13?!", "Yta. U didn't have to ask.", "Yep, YTA. Why on earth would you think that a grandfather would exclude his own grandchild? I understand how you fell about Anya, but that is something that needs to be worked out at home, with your husband.", "YTA you are completely delusional if you think your FIL will disinvite his biological granddaughter who he watched grow up so he can include a child he met a year ago. That\u2019s absurd. You can chose to stay home with your daughter. You can request your husband stay home. But you don\u2019t get to dictate to your in-laws who they can invite on a vacation they are paying for.", "You really thought anya\u2019s grandfather would uninvite his actual granddaughter in favour of you and your daughter? Lmao\n\nLook anya is wrong for the bullying but come on", "Info: if Anya has been bullying Ella for so long, why did you marry her dad and subject your daughter to her bully as a now step sibling?", "YTA both Anya and Ella are teens. Though Anya is bullying her in school, teach her, tell your husband to make her understand and give a punishment when she does this again\n\nYour FIL wants all his grand kids to go to the vacation and you have no say in it. To me your method of punishing her will make her more aggressive.\n\nAlso the facebook post part shows you don't actually like Anya and want to uninvite her at any cost and this is just an excuse", "Yta. There were ways to keep the girls separated on the trip and a more appropriate punishment for bullying. Your sil was right you are strangers to them compared to their niece and to expect her to be kicked out in favor of your daughter was ridiculous. All you did is make yourself look childish to your husbands family and further alienated your daughter from that family. Bullying is not ok but thinking her family was going to exclude her for it was a bit delusional on your part.", "YTA - blended families are hard work, quit being reactive and start seeking to understand the conflict that is between your daughter and your step daughter. Stomping your foot like a child and trying to force people to take sides by posting it on Facebook is manipulative and childish.", "YTA.  Hey, I know you are paying  for a trip for the whole family,  but please uninvited your  granddaughter....that is a dick move.\n\nNow, it doesn't mean you  excuse  bullying or picking on your daughter.   There are appropriate punishments.  \n\nI am not sure rarely  having them together is the best honestly, but maybe you  are right....but they clearly haven't  bonded, and it is very possible  that stepdaughter is acting out and blaming you and your  daughter for her parents split.\n\nI don't  jump on therapy as much  as others, but some family therapy with both girls present may be warranted.", "YTA\nAre you trying to be the wicked step mother? Cause that's what it seems like.\nI can understand not liking the bullying and wanting it to stop, but the solution to this problem isn't to antagonize your husbands family and put a line in the sand making it an us or them scenario.\nYou need to all be talking about the situation together. Make your step daughter understand that her behaviour is hurting her step sister. Being cut off from a family trip (them or you) does not accomplish this.", "YTA. That\u2019s his granddaughter.\n\nBut more importantly, I think you\u2019re all short sighted to not want to blend the girls in a meaningful way. Anya and Ella are now step sisters. How did you resolve the actual conflict? Did you get them together, or did you do the \u2018your daughter did this to mine!\u2019 approach?\n\nEdit: holy shit, I missed the part about you making an actual FB post about it. I\u2019m cringing for you as we speak.", "YTA. It's not up to you to tell your FIL what punishment is befitting his granddaughter. He didn't have to invite you and your daughter but has because he's obviously accepted you both in to the family. Obviously Anya is going to be invited on the FAMILY trip and if you can see how hurt your daughter is over what she said Anya and her friends did, surely you can see how upset Anya would be if she wasn't invited in the first place. \n\nMaybe the bigger issue here is that you don't have both girls at the same time. Both girls are going to struggle to get on if you keep them apart.\n\nAs for the Facebook rant, that's just immature. Guess what can happen here? Your husbands family can go NC with you, then your husband will feel like you are forcing him to choose between his family and you and then you'll end up divorced.", "YTA\n\nYou're overreaching with the vacation stuff. Double asshole move airing dirty laundry about a minor on Facebook.\n\nThe bullying sucks, but now you've shot yourself in the foot. The dynamics are only going to get worse from now on", "YTA I cannot hell wonder if your own treatment of Anya is partially why she goes after your daughter. I mean complaining that she was invited in the first place.\n\nThis is her blood family.", "YTA.  Figure it out fast or there will be permanent damage.", "YTA - You told your FIL to disinvite his own granddaughter on a trip that he is total funding and you think that's okay? You are a huge entitled AH. Is you were married to my brother for a year or less and you went demanding this I would have told you the same thing or worse that your SIL said. \n\nNews flash for you blending families isn't easy and definitely when the kids are teenagers. Should she had made fun of your daughter? NO. But should you as a grown woman pitched a tantrum and tried to bully your in-laws into disinviting their own granddaughter by saying you weren't going to attend? No you shouldn't have and you got put in your place because of it. You have probably damaged your relationship with your in-laws. You should apologize to them unless you want many more problems down the road.", "Posting about it on Facebook is extremely childish", "YTA. Maybe you and your daughter shouldn\u2019t go. Also, your daughter is NOT his grandchild.", "Yta. 1. Keep your business off of social media. 2. You may be family now but you are new family. The audacity of thinking that you could stop a grandparent from bringing their grandchildren on a trip", "I think the fact that they are step sisters who only interact as classmates has to be weird. This already starts off weird that because it's easier for the parents two teenage girls who are supposed to be sisters now don't actually get to live together. But after that, if something upsets you about what's going on with your husband's family, you can remove yourself and your daughter. But not make demands that an entire family leave their own niece/granddaughter home for you. And it shouldn't have taken an ultimatum for you to remove yourself from the situation. YTA and it sounds like a lot about this family dynamic needs to change.", "YTA.  I completely understand your feelings and detest bullying but this was not the appropriate solution.  Putting it on FB was also a AH move, this should be handled within the family.  Your FIL is not responsible for her punishment.  This responsibility is with your husband, her father.  Bullying is despicable behavior and should not be tolerated at any level, ever.  If your husband won't do right by BOTH girls, take it up with the school.  They can provide a safe environment for your child or use district money to transport her to another school where she can learn in a safe environment.  You should also highly consider family counseling.", "Ma\u2019am, YTA. The world does not revolve around you or your daughter. Yes, the SD is wrong for bullying your daughter, but to expect an entire family to exclude their niece for you and your daughter makes you sound delusional. \n\nIf this blended family is not working, it is for you 2, the adults that decided to blend the families, to fix it, and for sure not by involving extended family and facebook.", "YTA\n\nYou are asking your FIL to exclude his granddaughter but include your daughter who he has known a short [time.wow](https://time.wow),  you are entitled.\n\nThis should be handled in a different way.", "Did u really ask your FIL to uninvite his own granddaughter? Boy you have some balls!Her father needs to give her the appropriate punishment.You are crossing the boundaries here.Making the Facebook post? How immature. Putting your dirty laundry out there like that and you wonder why this child bullies?hmmm she\u2019s learning it somehow. YTA.Grow up.You had no business even asking to do that.", "Lol. Yes. YTA. Unlike Anya, your daughter isn't blood family, and missing a trip with her family isn't appropriate punishment. You didn't let her dad handle it, but you march around making demands? You spited the nose off your own face. This could have easily been handled at home, but instead you just went nuclear.", "YTA, from every angle one, can look at it.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t arbitrate your family issues publicly on Facebook!!!! That will cause permanent damage. Second, you chose to marry into a blended family. You have to work on issues and you can\u2019t bully your way through making unreasonable demands.

Not your decision.", "INFO: You say you trade off the girls week on/week off with their other respective \u2018biological\u2019 parent and that they never spend any time together, which you believe is for the best.

Ultimately you just achieved yourself being singled out and losing your daughter a trip and in the process potentially putting your marriage onto rocky waters.

You're seriously trying to shame a grandfather into uninviting his own grandchild from a Christmas trip? \n\nYou and your husband have deliberately kept your girls separate by alternating their weeks and now you're surprised they aren't getting along at all?", "YTA. Big time. \n\nYou and your husband are married. The girls are now family and are going to be in each others lives. Whilst they don\u2019t have much interaction outside of school at the moment, there\u2019s nothing to say that custody arrangements won\u2019t change in the future. You can\u2019t just avoid your step daughter. This is something that needs to be dealt with, by you and your husband, as mature parents. If your step daughter was your biological daughter and this happened, how would you approach that? It seems you\u2019ve had issues with your step daughter before this incident, given you being happy that you have the girls on alternating weeks. \n\nAnd omg, posting on Facebook about it? I am cringing so hard for you. \n\nGrow up, be a a mature adult about this and handle it appropriately.

If discipline is needed it should be discussed by the girls parents. You do not get to dictate the punishment to your FIL. Nor do you air your dissatisfaction with your step daughter on social media.\n\nYou can not expect to have someone uninvited to a family trip that you did not plan or pay for. Grandpa is not the one who should be disciplining the child at your direction. It is a parents job to discipline their children. A step parent may have input, but being a step parent for one year does not entitle you to be the disciplinarian in this case. I am sure you would feel the same if the roles were reversed.\n\nYou have shown the entire family that you are a petty and vindictive person that does not respect boundaries.

They also made it clear they don\u2019t view you or your daughter as family so yeah ouch. Kinda a AH thing to say but again you were being demanding so idk if they would have been nicer about it if you took a different approach. Probably not but I can\u2019t know for sure. \n\nSo ESH besides possibly your husband if he came up with another solution.", "Sil, while hurtful, has a point.

Maybe they would get along better, if they had spend more time with each other at your home .... who knows.

Your SIL is right, I get why you are mad, but you ARE delusional if you think they will uninvite the kid that IS part of their family by blood because of you and your daughter. Anya might be a \"mean girl\" but she is 14, I'd be outraged if her family didn't have her back and punish her by leaving her out of a family trip. That doesn't mean she don't need to recieve a punishment, but leaving her out of a trip is way to harsh. And if she is picking on your daughter she might resent you for marrying her father and is taking out on your daughter. Her father should take her to counselling and see what is underneath her behaviour. But excluding her from the family and making her family to prioritize a kid that she is cleary having trouble with is not the best approach.", "YTA. She needs a stern talking to and some lessons about bullying and she needs to be grounded.

Yes, you are protecting your daughter, but you can do that without Facebook posts. That was because of your hurt feelings.", "YTA.  You\u2019re acting like a child instead of a parent.

Oh you gotta be more mature than that. Also you should all fix your relationship because sadly you guys are all family now.\n\nAs someone also commented, the unreliable narrator vibes are off charts, and also victimizing.

Maybe what you all new to do is let the girls actually spend time together.  How can you be a family when you aren't all together at the same time.

Where is the trupo ppst in him?\nEdit to add, Anya may just be immature for her age. Hanging around girls that are older than her might be the issue. Yes she is smart but smart doesnt mean mature. She could feel like she has to go along with those other girls that are involved in the bullying to have friends. She could be trying to fit in.

All it means is that you're the new partner of one of their family members who happens to have a daughter.\n\nI get why you're mad and why you didn't go - I wouldn't have either - but your expectations of Anya's family was not realistic.", "YTA. Why do I feel like Ella is typing this?", "_\"He basically told me that if we have a problem with his granddaughter then we can just skip the trip.\"_\n\nExactly. OP sounds just as immature as the teenagers in this scenario. Bullying is wrong. Full stop. The bullying should be punished. Again, full stop. This requires parenting - not delusional ultimatums. OP also decided to involve a bunch of randos into her family dispute by posting on social media to, in essence, rally other adults to cyber bully her minor stepdaughter. \n\nOP and her daughter are new additions to this family. She is basically giving demands and ultimatums to her FIL, and saying it's either her and her kid or this man's grandfather. He gave his answer, and in case OP understand the message - she and her kid is no longer invited to this trip.", "Yeah. YTA. Public humiliation is not how you deal with a young teenager bullying. Also it sounds like the kids in this family have had a hard time with the blending. OP daughter gets to live with dad all the time and OP step-daughter only gets to see her dad half the time. Now she wants the kid excluded from family time _as a punishment_? That's a plan straight from the Driving a Wedge in to Blended Families think tank. How could that not make the bullying worse?\n\nEdit: the kids are never there at the same time? Damn. That sounds even more like a family conflict factory.", "I actually feel like this woman is the stereotypical step-mother that's in most movies, shows and stories haha. So interesting to see that PoV.", "It\u2018s really strange how different bullying is judged by this sub. NSometimes bullies are the worst, no punishments are to hard, not going on a trip would be the minimum punishment and sometimes it\u2019s the opposite. Not judging, just interesting.", "Yeah, not really OP\u2019s call here. And the FB post was just crass", "OP making posts like this and thinking they're justified is the reason I haven't been on Facebook in like five years.", "You are spot on. This takes entitlement to its highest degree.", "She ended up punishing her own daughter.", "I would guess that OP\u2019s daughter probably acts just like her mother, hence the \u201cbullying \u201c .", "YTA. you asked a man to exclude his own granddaughter for your daughter. You haven't even been married into this family for a year. He barely knows you and probably your daughter is a virtual stranger to him. He is not going to, nor should he be expected to, prioritize you over his grandchild that he has known for her whole life. Get over yourself.", "Imagine all the dinners while on the trip, all the family talking about the crazy stepmother and trying to convnce him to run away...\n\nAmazing how she did this to herself.", "Absolutely! Just the way she mentions that Anya was invited even though she won\u2019t be with them, yeah obviously, that\u2019s his granddaughter.", "I don\u2019t think so. I think they each have a daughter from a previous relationship and both have separate custody agreements for the two daughters with each daughter\u2019s respective second parent.\n\nEdit: In such a case, the primary responsibility OP has is to the daughter she brought into this new relationship. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a new relationship or an old one, but both she and her husband obviously have work to do teaching Anya to respect Ella.", "worried about bullying and then brings a family temper tantrum to facebook. woof", "That\u2019s the only thing OP CAN do at the end of the day - remove herself and her daughter from the environment. Whether the rest of the family will try to remedy this or not is out of her hands. OP should just take her daughter somewhere else for vacation by herself.", "Exactly her & her daughter are strangers to the family", "Honestly, her stepdaughter should be grounded from vacations right now for bullying in general. Even if it was some other kid OP had no relation to.", "Exactly I bet she wouldn\u2019t post it on Facebook of it was her biological kid to", "Ella is her own daughter, stepdaughter's name is Anya...", "Yeah. No Way where they going without Anya", "God thiiiis - I was overweight through puberty (the weight fell off pretty much as soon as it was done - thanks, hormones), and I got bullied by a lot of people as a result. If I\u2019d had a mother who felt like broadcasting my pain was her business, I probably would have been in serious danger of self-harm. How awful.", "This, I suspect that facebook  post has been shared all over the school.", "Couldn't have said it better. Yes!", ">He gave his answer, and in case OP understand the message - she and her kid is no longer invited to this trip.\n\nShe and her kid will probably be uninvited from quite a bit in the future, after OP's facebook post.", "I know right having the kids only at different weeks is so weird!  like they are in the same year in school so their relationship is primarily classmate not family\n\nop YTA for the facebook post mostly imo immature, but also the expectation.  your inability to integrate your family and parent your two daughters in such a way that they can get along doesn't mean FIL has to uninvite his granddaughter", "OP has already concluded that her daughter and step-daughter are not equals and can not get along. \n\nSuch a stubborn asshole.", "> Also, the unreliable narrator vibes are strong with this one.\n\nIndeed. Perhaps there was bullying. Perhaps it\u2019s a long complex saga. Perhaps it was a misunderstanding. Anything at all could be happening between these two girls including that they\u2019re acting out issues that stem from OP herself. \n\nWhat is not in doubt is that OP is acting like a sophomore without enough extra-curriculars.", "Agree.  Which also makes you wonder if her daughter shares the same challenge . With only one narrative,  who knows what even happened yet.  How was her first thought not to tell her husband we need to sit down for a talk with the girls?", "Correct on your edit we were not asked to judge step daughters actions and I agree with you there should be no E S H", "Exactly, it already seems that OP dislikes her step daughter, and the daughters are probably feeding off this energy, and Anya is acting out, instead of maybe OP taking time to actually bond with her step daughter, and having both of them together for once instead of this weird divide. A normal step mother should want to do things with both girls to start building a bond, but its very obvious that OP favors her own daughter and there is the vibe that she thinks her daughter is better then Anya..\n\nBut maybe I am reading to much into this.", "She might not. Sometimes the kids of over-controlling/domineering parents developmentally grow up to be timid & get bullied because of their clear lack of self-confidence. The fact that it is OP's stepdaughter AND a group of other girls leads me to believe her poor kid is getting picked on, just that her mom also makes the situation worse for her.", ">neither is the dad hand-waving it away\n\nhe didn't hand-wave it away.\n\nHe said he would handle it.\n\nJust because he's not doling out the punishment OP wants it doesn't mean he's doing nothing.", "Absolutely true, but the fact is that OP's husband's side of the family organized and paid for the trip, and OP and her daughter were invited as an extended-family courtesy. I totally understand OP not being happy with her stepdaughter (and this bullying definitely shouldn't be hand-waved away like that), but it's entitled and unrealistic to expect OP's FIL to uninvite his own granddaughter from a family trip that's been planned for a while.\n\nAlso that Facebook part was just flat out horrible. Making a provocative post against your extended family  has never *ever* solved anything or made anyone any friends, and is just a way to add extra drama to an already messy situation.\n\nEveryone sucks here to varying degrees, except OP's daughter, poor girl gets bullied *and* then gets denied a trip *and* now is probably embarrassed to death by all this shit. OP, why don't you take her to a different trip, either just the two of you or with some supportive relatives or friends. Least you can do.\n\nEdit: judging by OP's other comments in this thread, she really doesn't seem like the sharpest tool in the box. Oh dear.", "He was told about it & in the same conversation said he\u2019d find an appropriate punishment to address it. That\u2019s literally the only mention we have of him knowing, and it\u2019s right at the end of the post. How is that handwaving it away?\n\nOP made a huge mistake in going to her FIL \u2014 to whom she is apparently still a *stranger* \u2014 before even informing her husband.", "Where is calling out a literal minor in a trashy ass Facebook post in anyway everyone sucks here? So she bullies Opie\u2018s daughter so OP decides let me put this literal minors name out here to all my friends and basically bully her in return? Na the daughter is probably getting punished according to the Post just not in the way the OP wants and OP is a bully.", "The bullying isn\u2019t the issue we are judging.", "Saying hell find an appropriate punishment doesnt sound like hand waving to me", "The other daughter is an AH for bullying, but the FIL and husband are not AHs for allowing the daughter to come on the trip", "Right?! When I got to the part about her Facebook post it gave me actual chills. Who *does* that?! \n\nI feel bad for both of the kids, honestly - if this is her response to sibling rivalry/friction/bullying, they really never stood a chance. OP is just taking sides and joining in. \n\nI didn\u2019t initially have an easy relationship with my step siblings when I was younger - but thankfully our parents never took sides and we went from being rivals to close siblings pretty quickly (it feels strange describing my brother and sister as \u2018step\u2019 siblings now lol). It could have been similar to what OP describes with the bullying etc so easily.", "Thank you, I will correct", "OMG, I'm so glad Facebook didn't exist when I was a teenager.  The lies my mother would have written....", "100%. OP also sounds like she has waged war with Anya. If I were the husband in this scenario, I wouldn't want OP in the house with my kid after this saga. Anya is wrong for bullying Ella, but OP has taken this from a situation that could have perhaps been resolved under the guidance of two mature parents to a relationship ending clusterf*ck.\n\nThis family needs to seek the guidance of a mediation/mental health care professional at this point. But, that will only work if there are two mature and reasonable adults leading the way. I get the vibe that OP will tell the husband it's Anya or me, and will get a very rude awakening when he doesn't play her game.", "Yeah and the crazy part is\u2026. They go to the same school and same grade too!! I don\u2019t see how it could work.", "Absolutely! And perhaps the girls don't get along as they never *learned* to get along. They were actually taught they DO NOT BELONG together.\n\nHow weird that must feel... there's someone living in your house, but only when you're not there, and you hardly ever see them. Great way to alienate those girls.", "Yeah, I have a feeling there's conflict between the two daughters, but have all the evidence required to know that OP has played a huge influence in that.\n\nIf there's bullying going on, I don't believe for a second that it's only the stepdaughter doing the bullying. Even if OP's daughter isn't bullying the stepdaughter, we have every reason to believe that OP herself is.", "100% this. Both of these kids are your daughters, or so you say, but you treat only the one you birthed as a daughter. If you had two biological daughters and one was being mean to the other, what would you do? Certainly NOT the thing you did. Clearly you're not a fan of your step daughter, surely she feels that and knows that since she's with you half the time. Surely she's realized there must be some reason you never want the girls to overlap in your home. Surely she takes that personally at 14. I am 42 and would take it personally. YTA and your husband is also TA for letting you treat his daughter this way. So sorry for Ella that your behavior ripples out so far as to cause her strife at school.", "This should have exactly been her first thought, not Anya should be banned from her family trip, it gives the vibe of OP alienating and possibly bullying Anya in her own home, and now Anya is acting out by bullying OPs daughter.", "This. My cousin wasn\u2019t invited to my wedding for a bunch of different reasons and made a few Facebook posts about it, to my knowledge. It didn\u2019t change a damn thing- I didn\u2019t suddenly send her an invite.", "Thinking about that, they probably do need extra guidance on how to navigate explaining the house thing.  I am sure the other kids think it is weird and I wonder if that isn't kind of where the bullying started with asking stuff like \"does she sleep in your bed? How do you feel knowing that she could be doing X with your stuff?\"  Kids can spiral into nastyness like critiquing weight real fast given that kind of opening.", "I wonder if they share a bedroom. That would feel even weirder.", "I don't necessarily think that's an issue. Maybe this is indeed better for their daughters, we don't know. Our not really alienating, they are just not living together. Maybe they do have family activities together, like this trip, to bond. Throwing all the step kids together isn't always the best option.\n\nBut I do agree that op seems a bad narrator, just don't agree on this comment.", "I agree heartily", "I agree. OP is bullying her step-daughter on FB, so I'm guessing she does the same IRL too.", "Exactly! Part of my comment was asking whether anyone has spoken to Anya to try and understand why she is targeting Ella. Bullies project their misery onto what they perceive to be easy targets.", "Especially if the daughter didn't share a room at first. \n\nYou know it is especially bad if one day she was told here is your new sister, she is in your room when you aren't here.", "Creating a competition where there doesn\u2019t need to b one", "100%!
