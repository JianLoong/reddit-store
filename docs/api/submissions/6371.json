I waited for my husband to come back home and told him everything. He said \"he'll handle it\" I asked him if that means Anya is uninvited and he said no but he will find an appropriate punishment.

That is a separate issue that your husband needs to deal what. You cant expect your FIL to not invite HIS GRANDKID to a trip HE PLANNED. You have taken this too far but posting this on social media. Why did you even do that? That\u2019s such a immature thing to do.", "YTA\u2026this isn\u2019t your vacation, your FIL can invite who he wants and he\u2019s inviting all of his grandchildren. \n\nAlso, way to make it about you and put it on Facebook.", "YTA. \n\nAnya's bullying of Ella is absolutely not okay and should be handled, but you are the bigger asshole in this scenario by deciding that the only appropriate punishment is to disinvite Anya - your FIL's biological grandchild - from a trip that you're not even paying for. \n\nAnd putting all of this on social media? You **seriously** put a 14 year old on blast on social media? You should be ashamed of yourself.", "You really don\u2019t see how wildly inappropriate it was for you to contact FIL and ask him to uninvite his own grandkid from a trip *he* is paying for? You did that without even speaking to your husband first.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nYTA", "YTA and delusional for thinking your demands and social media posts were going to help you in any way. Nothing of what you did addressed the actual issue or will make life better for your daughter.", "You say \u2018we\u2019 have two kids, but from what you write it sounds like you and your husband have one kid (your bio daughter), and your husband has a kid who you tolerate and refuse to parent at best, but also who you actively bully/exclude and publicly humiliate on occasion. You\u2019re not just a bad parent, you are an abusive one. \n\nIt amazes me that you\u2019re surprised Anya thinks bullying is acceptable - after all, she\u2019s just copying your behaviour. \n\nYTA, and I hope that your husband gets you out of his daughter\u2019s life ASAP before you do any more damage.", "YTA, you're FIL paid for everything, so he essentially has final say.  Perhaps instead of trying to get your stepdaughter uninvited from a family trip, you should all be sitting down as a family to try to talk through and resolve the issues, maybe try therapy.  Also, it's pretty classless to be posting that type of stuff on FB.", "YTA. You don't get to decide the punishment for someone else's child. So YES you are wrong for your expectations, and total AH for overstepping and dictating this situation with your in-laws. You would not want your husband punishing your child behind your back?!!!  Shame on you!  Your husband is the ONLY one who decides what punishment is appropriate for HIS child. You let your anger drive you and you are crossing boundaries.", "YTA\n\nThe bullying is not okay. I want to make that clear.\n\nBut you don\u2019t get to decide that the punishment is that she can\u2019t come on a trip organised by her FIL for the entire family. And you ESPECIALLY don\u2019t get to decide that without her father on board.\n\nAnd the Facebook rant? Uncalled for. And childish. But with the karmic benefit of demonstrating to all how entitled you are. So well done on playing yourself, I guess.", "YTA. You did answer your own question since you are two strangers to his family and you expect them to choose you.  You should let your husband or the school or as a couple handle it as a family.  It\u2019s immature to make Facebook posts and not expect a reaction.", "YTA.   Anya's behavior isn't okay. Your expectation that your FIL uninvite his granddaughter is also not okay.  You can't expect other people to uninvited people from an event when it's important to them to go. All you can do is not go yourself.  Your FB post crossed a line too.  Your only recourse here is not to go.\n\nYou reacted in such a \"NO WAY\" way.  You could have used it as a teaching moment.  I know it's hard. That age involves a lot of bullying and not wanting to subject your daughter to it makes sense.   But your way of dealing with it made it worse even for your daughter", "Yta, I get protecting your daughter but a public Facebook post and asking them to uninvite her is beyond ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nIf nothing else than for the Facebook post.

Why are you imploding your family this way? \n\nIt\u2019s your in laws\u2019 trip and and they have every right to have their grandchild there, and you can\u2019t turn a 14 year old off a trip the week before (her mother might have made other plans!) - plus it\u2019s the wrong thing to signify for the success of your blended family that she will be turfed out of family events for bad behaviour.\n\nI understand you\u2019re motivated from a good place trying to protect your daughter and her mental health. But you\u2019ve actually detracted from fixing her problem with your outrageous overshadow. That\u2019s assholery!", "YTA-you should have started with husband. If you didn\u2019t get the response you wanted, you should have then removed yourselves from the trip if you felt that strongly about it. I actually think you made a huge mistake. The girls probably could have really learned to get along on this trip under the supervision of the adults. You definitely don\u2019t get to put an ultimatum on FIL about his own granddaughter, and you were definitely wrong to put this entire situation out on FB. You\u2019re trying to bully your family members into doing what you want and that\u2019s worse than your step-daughter, because at least she\u2019s actually a kid. You\u2019re and adult and acting like a kid.", "YTA.\n\nThe bullying is not okay.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ve only been married for a year. How much has your daughter interacted with her step grandparents?\n\nThe fact that she and you were invited in the first place was a huge step in including you in the family. It wasn\u2019t something they had to do. To take that gratitude and shove it in their face speaks volumes.\n\nThe proper steps here were to deal with this with your husband and come to a decision together, with the knowledge that you may have to make steps on your own if you didn\u2019t like the outcome.\n\nYou are married to a man who has a daughter that bullies your child and with whom you disagree when it comes to handling the situation. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s sustainable to begin with, but I\u2019m especially unsure after you put his entire family on blast for having a family vacation.\n\nThis whole situation is a mess.", "Some nerve you have to call a child\u2019s grandfather and ask him to uninvite his granddaughter.\n\nYou went to Facebook about it? How old are you?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou aren't paying for it, your FIL is and Anya is his biological granddaughter, so of course she is going to take precedence over you and your daughter.\n\nIf you don't want your daughter around her, don't go. If you don't think your husband will put a stop to the bullying, don't go.", "This really the hill you want to die on? Punish Anya by withholding a trip and diminishing the chance at improving relations with her? How will that change her behavior towards Ella? And going onto social media to rant about it? Looks like you still have some adulting to do. YTA.", "YTA. I totally agree that Anya is a poop and your husband needs to address her behavior. However, I put you in AH territory for three reasons:\n\n1. It was unrealistic to expect a grandparent to boot his granddaughter from a trip he planned and paid for.\n\n2. Posting about it on Facebook was weird and immature.\n\n3. Keeping your daughter away from her stepsister will not solve the problem. I understand wanting that in the short term so she can get some space but, long term, they are family now. The goal should be to address the root issues so they can have a healthier relationship.\n\nYou should either skip the trip or go and see if you can use it as an opportunity to work on the relationship between your daughter and stepdaughter. A trip away from their peers and supervised by you and your husband might not be a bad thing.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have talked to your husband first (not FIL) and let him handle it.  You jumped the gun and became judge jury and executioner all at once.  And do you really think the other family is going to uninivite their own blood grand-daughter for the angry mom and step kid? \n\n Double YTA for going to SM.\n\nThe punishment for Anya, assuming there is something there to punish for, is a separate issue, don't involve the IL's extended family in this.", "YTA, big time. *And* you made a post on Facebook? Good lord, how old are you, 13?!", "Yta. U didn't have to ask.", "Yep, YTA. Why on earth would you think that a grandfather would exclude his own grandchild? I understand how you fell about Anya, but that is something that needs to be worked out at home, with your husband.", "YTA you are completely delusional if you think your FIL will disinvite his biological granddaughter who he watched grow up so he can include a child he met a year ago. That\u2019s absurd. You can chose to stay home with your daughter. You can request your husband stay home. But you don\u2019t get to dictate to your in-laws who they can invite on a vacation they are paying for.", "You really thought anya\u2019s grandfather would uninvite his actual granddaughter in favour of you and your daughter? Lmao\n\nLook anya is wrong for the bullying but come on", "Info: if Anya has been bullying Ella for so long, why did you marry her dad and subject your daughter to her bully as a now step sibling?", "YTA both Anya and Ella are teens. Though Anya is bullying her in school, teach her, tell your husband to make her understand and give a punishment when she does this again\n\nYour FIL wants all his grand kids to go to the vacation and you have no say in it. To me your method of punishing her will make her more aggressive.\n\nAlso the facebook post part shows you don't actually like Anya and want to uninvite her at any cost and this is just an excuse", "Yta. There were ways to keep the girls separated on the trip and a more appropriate punishment for bullying. Your sil was right you are strangers to them compared to their niece and to expect her to be kicked out in favor of your daughter was ridiculous. All you did is make yourself look childish to your husbands family and further alienated your daughter from that family. Bullying is not ok but thinking her family was going to exclude her for it was a bit delusional on your part.", "YTA - blended families are hard work, quit being reactive and start seeking to understand the conflict that is between your daughter and your step daughter. Stomping your foot like a child and trying to force people to take sides by posting it on Facebook is manipulative and childish.", "YTA.  Hey, I know you are paying  for a trip for the whole family,  but please uninvited your  granddaughter....that is a dick move.\n\nNow, it doesn't mean you  excuse  bullying or picking on your daughter.   There are appropriate punishments.  \n\nI am not sure rarely  having them together is the best honestly, but maybe you  are right....but they clearly haven't  bonded, and it is very possible  that stepdaughter is acting out and blaming you and your  daughter for her parents split.\n\nI don't  jump on therapy as much  as others, but some family therapy with both girls present may be warranted.", "YTA\nAre you trying to be the wicked step mother? Cause that's what it seems like.\nI can understand not liking the bullying and wanting it to stop, but the solution to this problem isn't to antagonize your husbands family and put a line in the sand making it an us or them scenario.\nYou need to all be talking about the situation together. Make your step daughter understand that her behaviour is hurting her step sister. Being cut off from a family trip (them or you) does not accomplish this.", "YTA. That\u2019s his granddaughter.\n\nBut more importantly, I think you\u2019re all short sighted to not want to blend the girls in a meaningful way. Anya and Ella are now step sisters. How did you resolve the actual conflict? Did you get them together, or did you do the \u2018your daughter did this to mine!\u2019 approach?\n\nEdit: holy shit, I missed the part about you making an actual FB post about it. I\u2019m cringing for you as we speak.", "YTA. It's not up to you to tell your FIL what punishment is befitting his granddaughter. He didn't have to invite you and your daughter but has because he's obviously accepted you both in to the family. Obviously Anya is going to be invited on the FAMILY trip and if you can see how hurt your daughter is over what she said Anya and her friends did, surely you can see how upset Anya would be if she wasn't invited in the first place. \n\nMaybe the bigger issue here is that you don't have both girls at the same time. Both girls are going to struggle to get on if you keep them apart.\n\nAs for the Facebook rant, that's just immature. Guess what can happen here? Your husbands family can go NC with you, then your husband will feel like you are forcing him to choose between his family and you and then you'll end up divorced.", "YTA\n\nYou're overreaching with the vacation stuff. Double asshole move airing dirty laundry about a minor on Facebook.\n\nThe bullying sucks, but now you've shot yourself in the foot. The dynamics are only going to get worse from now on", "YTA I cannot hell wonder if your own treatment of Anya is partially why she goes after your daughter. I mean complaining that she was invited in the first place.\n\nThis is her blood family.", "YTA.  Figure it out fast or there will be permanent damage.", "YTA - You told your FIL to disinvite his own granddaughter on a trip that he is total funding and you think that's okay? You are a huge entitled AH. Is you were married to my brother for a year or less and you went demanding this I would have told you the same thing or worse that your SIL said. \n\nNews flash for you blending families isn't easy and definitely when the kids are teenagers. Should she had made fun of your daughter? NO. But should you as a grown woman pitched a tantrum and tried to bully your in-laws into disinviting their own granddaughter by saying you weren't going to attend? No you shouldn't have and you got put in your place because of it. You have probably damaged your relationship with your in-laws. You should apologize to them unless you want many more problems down the road.", "Posting about it on Facebook is extremely childish", "YTA. Maybe you and your daughter shouldn\u2019t go. Also, your daughter is NOT his grandchild.", "Yta. 1. Keep your business off of social media. 2. You may be family now but you are new family. The audacity of thinking that you could stop a grandparent from bringing their grandchildren on a trip", "I think the fact that they are step sisters who only interact as classmates has to be weird. This already starts off weird that because it's easier for the parents two teenage girls who are supposed to be sisters now don't actually get to live together. But after that, if something upsets you about what's going on with your husband's family, you can remove yourself and your daughter. But not make demands that an entire family leave their own niece/granddaughter home for you. And it shouldn't have taken an ultimatum for you to remove yourself from the situation. YTA and it sounds like a lot about this family dynamic needs to change.", "YTA.  I completely understand your feelings and detest bullying but this was not the appropriate solution.  Putting it on FB was also a AH move, this should be handled within the family.  Your FIL is not responsible for her punishment.  This responsibility is with your husband, her father.  Bullying is despicable behavior and should not be tolerated at any level, ever.  If your husband won't do right by BOTH girls, take it up with the school.  They can provide a safe environment for your child or use district money to transport her to another school where she can learn in a safe environment.  You should also highly consider family counseling.", "Ma\u2019am, YTA. The world does not revolve around you or your daughter. Yes, the SD is wrong for bullying your daughter, but to expect an entire family to exclude their niece for you and your daughter makes you sound delusional. \n\nIf this blended family is not working, it is for you 2, the adults that decided to blend the families, to fix it, and for sure not by involving extended family and facebook.", "YTA\n\nYou are asking your FIL to exclude his granddaughter but include your daughter who he has known a short [time.wow](https://time.wow),  you are entitled.\n\nThis should be handled in a different way.", "Did u really ask your FIL to uninvite his own granddaughter? Boy you have some balls!Her father needs to give her the appropriate punishment.You are crossing the boundaries here.Making the Facebook post? How immature. Putting your dirty laundry out there like that and you wonder why this child bullies?hmmm she\u2019s learning it somehow. YTA.Grow up.You had no business even asking to do that.", "Lol. Yes. YTA. Unlike Anya, your daughter isn't blood family, and missing a trip with her family isn't appropriate punishment. You didn't let her dad handle it, but you march around making demands? You spited the nose off your own face. This could have easily been handled at home, but instead you just went nuclear.", "YTA, from every angle one, can look at it.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t arbitrate your family issues publicly on Facebook!!!! That will cause permanent damage. Second, you chose to marry into a blended family. You have to work on issues and you can\u2019t bully your way through making unreasonable demands.

Not your decision.", "INFO: You say you trade off the girls week on/week off with their other respective \u2018biological\u2019 parent and that they never spend any time together, which you believe is for the best.
