Your daughter can hear no. It's fine. You can help her level up with advice.", "NTA. First, you are allowed to have things for yourself. Having children doesn't entitle them to all you have. Second, this is an important lesson for your daughter. She wants to have what you have in the game, she can EARN it like you did. Your husband's thinking is wrong, here, imo.", "NTA and as a mom of 3 (youngest is 7) and a teacher with a child development major I'm a little furious about this. Moms are allowed to have things for themselves. Your daughter is not going to feel like you \"put the game above her\" if you don't let her have it--that's ridiculous. What she'll learn is that she can't take things that belong to other people just because she wants it. \n\nAlso, she's 7. She's not 2. She is old enough that this sort of behavior (crying to get your way when you've been told no) is totally inappropriate. You're not only NTA, but your husband is kind of TA. Giving in to your daughter here is a bad parenting move AND a bad husbanding move.", "Nta, what your daughter will remember is that you taught her how to grow and get things for herself, develop problem solving skills, set goals, and learn that persistence means progress.\n\nBuy her a mount/cosmetic skin/whatever the v game does from the real currency store to give her a short term pickup and then playbside by side. She'll care more about playing with you than playing for you as she gets more confident. Just make sure you give her time to do what she wants in game.", "If you just give her your account, you're just teaching her that she can get anything she wants if she whines enough. And that she doesn't have to have respect for other people's property.\nIf you don't give her your account, you're teaching her boundaries and that some things have to be earned on your own.\n\nNTA.", "NTA or she can learn not to take shortcuts in life and work for her success. Or that not everything is or should be handed to you on a silver platter.", "NTA. Parents are still allowed to have things to themselves. What I would do is tell your daughter that you will help her build her account and make it so it is special time for you to spend together.", "INFO: a tip, really \u2014 be careful of your login and password, if the game uses those. It\u2019s not uncommon for someone who\u2019s been told no, to sneak in and do it anyway. I\u2019m worried that your husband might let her log into your game, or worse, delete your game and make you start over from scratch. I hope I\u2019m wrong.", "NTA. As a gaming mum, I've set boundaries with my girls, and even the 4 year old has her own account for games (mostly minecraft, kid's a budding restone genius). Online games I treat differently. I've made sure that if they play games with others that they have the 'online safety' talk and that it's age appropriate. Lot of weirdos out there.\n\nThe point is: if you have to give things to children it has to be so that they can use it to gain their OWN achievements, whether it's a game or anything else in life. So for her to have her own account for a game is great start point if doesn't get it any other way. It's best to teach some things early.\n\nYou can guide them, but you can't do it FOR them. \n\nWatching how proud my eldest children are when they achieve things in life (and game) is a fantastic feeling. And to think it started with me saying that they had to use their own accounts on the xbox years ago to gain achievements for THEMSELVES and not for others or to ride off of another's coattails.", "NTA: But, maybe sit and play with her on her account with her on your lap. Show her how to get some of the cool \"free\" things in the game to garner her interest. Maybe once in a while, if she still shows interest, you get a gift card for the game (assuming the game has loadable cards) as a gift for her birthday, christmas, etc, for the purchasable content. That way, she can have her own too, and she also feels she earned something.", "NTA I know this is you're daughter so I'm not saying this to target her specifically but fuck them kids, that's my work, blood, swept, and tears. I would never allow a child to play on an online account like that because they will mess with it and could potentially ruin it", "NTA - Your daughter is an important part of your life, but that doesn't mean she's entitled to anything just because she wants it. Wants are not needs.\n\nIs the game more important than your daughter? No. But is it completely worthless to you? Also no.\n\nYou enjoy it, which is good for your mood, which lets you be in a good mood around your daughter as well.\n\nDon't needlessly burn things you enjoy in life to prove your daughter is important to you.\n\nI bet your husband doesn't let her always choose what to watch on TV, or what to eat, or how he can enjoy his free time.\n\nYou shouldn't never eat a piece of pizza again because your non-starving daughter would enjoy also eating it and if you eat it clearly you care more about yourself than her. Your husband is being silly.", "I\u2019m bothered by the fact your husband told you need to \u201cgrow up\u201d because you have a kid now. Sounds like he\u2019s being disrespectful to you and your hobbies. Are you able to lock your game so it can\u2019t be played by anyone else? He sounds like he\u2019d let her play on your account without you there if she asked him. NTA but your husband is", "NTA - Show her how to get the cool things", "This is your hobby and pastime.  If you enjoyed painting, would you let your daughter paint her own picture?  Or let her paint all over one you\u2019ve finished?  If your husband enjoyed ship modeling, would he allow her to place the fine detailing?  Would he immediately put his daughter on his friend group football team (baring accidents)?  \nThat saying, you can help build up her own account so she can get more, faster.\nNTA.", "NTA but help her start her own game and be really involved, tell her how great she\u2019s doing and show her some tips. Explain there\u2019s stuff earlier in the game you don\u2019t want her to miss. Make it about how it will be more fun for her and she can benefit from her own play and from your experienced insight", "Honestly as someone who also plays a game that sounds similar to what you\u2019re describing, NTA but I think I need more info. If you let her play one your account then she\u2019s likely to play against better players and get yelled at for not playing well since she\u2019s new and a child. If the game isn\u2019t competitive and has more open world aspects then I think supervised play time on your account is fine but getting her own account also helps teach her how to play better anyway. Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but this kind of denied access and your reaction to it is really important in how your child will react to being told no in the future as well. She doesn\u2019t NEED to use your account and it\u2019s normal to have that boundary and you offered a fair and good alternative where she can still play with you but she\u2019s crying to get what she wants and if you give in now it\u2019ll be harder in the future and you\u2019ll get this kind of reaction because she\u2019ll know she\u2019ll get her way.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone said already: you're allowed to have your own things. You are not required to share everythig with your child.\nIt's not like you forbade your daughter to play it at all and kept it totally private from her. You want to share it with her and that's important. Your husband is in the wrong as well. It might be a silly game for him but it's important to you and he's being condescending and dismissive.", "NTA - you're allowed to have things that are your own. she's not going to remember that the game was more important than she was, she's going to learn a valuable lesson that she can't always have things her own way and that building something from the ground up, putting in her own time and effort, is far more rewarding.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want a child on an adult\u2019s account, as then there is no way for other players to know if they are talking to the adult account holder, or the child.", "For privacy reasons?", "INFO: If you let her play on your account, would you potentially lose any points or any items you've collected or anything, if she \"loses\", since she's inexperienced?", "NTA. \n\nCan you play under her name to buff her account or gift her stuff from your account to help bridge the gap a bit? \n\nAlso my head Canon is the game in question is Neopets.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
