I'm slowly losing the weight plus food tastes so much better when you're hungry.\n\nI love double stuffed Oreos. I'll buy a bag and throw them in the freezer and eat the whole thing Saturday night. My kids know those are mine. My eldest son Jacob is 20. He floats between his college frat house, his mom's and my house depending on what he wants.\n\nHe'll go to his mom's to do laundry or to have quiet time since he's her only child and she works a lot. He comes to my house because my wife will make him home-cooked meals and to see our two other sons.\n\nI came home last night and Jacob had been there to play video games with my 9yo and 11yo. I didn't see him but I saw that a lot of my food was missing. My wife said that he said that he had no food bank at his frat house so she heat up a tray of lasagna and he took that, 3 12 packs of ginger ale, chips and string cheese.\n\nThat irritated me that he's taking food from my place to go back to his. This morning I went to get my Oreos and they were missing from the freezer. I asked my 9 and 11yo if they ate it and they said no. Jacob took it. \n\nI was pissed. Then Jacob shows up to drop off Tupperware. I asked him if he took my Oreos and he said he did and didn't know those were mine. So I said to go to the store and replace the ones you took. He said didn't have time, sorry and can I stop talking about it because he will bring another package next week. \n\nI said no. Go to the store now. He said no. So I said get the fuck out of my house. He asked if I was being serious and I said I was. You come here like I'm a food bank and you took the one thing that I looked forward to eating and you want to replace it when you feel like it.\n\nHe left and before he did, I made it clear that he was being kicked out and not leaving because he wanted to.", "created_utc": 1677969693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ifnd8/aita_for_kicking_my_son_out_for_eating_my_oreos/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm slowly losing the weight plus food tastes so much better when you're hungry.\n\nI love double stuffed Oreos. I'll buy a bag and throw them in the freezer and eat the whole thing Saturday night. My kids know those are mine. My eldest son Jacob is 20. He floats between his college frat house, his mom's and my house depending on what he wants.\n\nHe'll go to his mom's to do laundry or to have quiet time since he's her only child and she works a lot. He comes to my house because my wife will make him home-cooked meals and to see our two other sons.\n\nI came home last night and Jacob had been there to play video games with my 9yo and 11yo. I didn't see him but I saw that a lot of my food was missing. My wife said that he said that he had no food bank at his frat house so she heat up a tray of lasagna and he took that, 3 12 packs of ginger ale, chips and string cheese.\n\nThat irritated me that he's taking food from my place to go back to his. This morning I went to get my Oreos and they were missing from the freezer. I asked my 9 and 11yo if they ate it and they said no. Jacob took it. \n\nI was pissed. Then Jacob shows up to drop off Tupperware. I asked him if he took my Oreos and he said he did and didn't know those were mine. So I said to go to the store and replace the ones you took. He said didn't have time, sorry and can I stop talking about it because he will bring another package next week. \n\nI said no. Go to the store now. He said no. So I said get the fuck out of my house. He asked if I was being serious and I said I was. You come here like I'm a food bank and you took the one thing that I looked forward to eating and you want to replace it when you feel like it.\n\nHe left and before he did, I made it clear that he was being kicked out and not leaving because he wanted to.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
