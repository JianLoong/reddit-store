Also, she clearly doesn't want anything to do with them either  so not going is a good move.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for taking the heat.  BTW his behavior is pretty much proof that her concerns are valid.  I say \"put his business in the streets\".  Tell your folks that she is afraid to be alone with her family because of their past behavior.  Unless they are seriously lacking, they will help you protect your wife.", "NTA. You rock!", "Youre deffo NTA.\n\nYou're essentially a good man, trying to protect your wife, until she has more confidence to stand up for herself! I suspect with you by her side all the strength she needs will flourish.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up to her parents because she was never able to. I bet they would still mistreat her had she gone to the wedding anniversary by herself. Those kinds of people don't change overnight. I always call my husband my angel bc he got me out of an emotionally abusive household. We are all thankful for husbands/partners like you.", "The title to this is a bit misleading. It's not that you're 'not letting' your wife see her parents, she doesn\u2019t want to see them and you're helping her to escape. So NTA", "NTA.  No, you're protecting your wife.  Granted, she needs to stand up for herself and if they raise a hand to her, DO SOMETHING about it herself.  She's an adult.  However, if she feels safer with you present, there is no reason for her to go on her own and they have no right to demand anything from her.  She's an adult.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is not a baby. She can decide whether or not she wants to meet them, and she has chosen not to. Her parents need to honour that, or they won\u2019t have any relationship with her in the future.", "You know, that's fair.  But that takes time.  Someone who has been dominated and brutalized needs a lot of time to heal.", "I just need to say that no matter the start of your marriage, you\u2019re killing it now. (\u201cKilling it\u201d in the good way.) The respect you\u2019re showing your wife is admirable. Keep it up and it won\u2019t be long until she\u2019s fully in love with you. \n\nYou\u2019re a stand up dude and it\u2019s very appreciated. I came from an abusive childhood and I couldn\u2019t start to heal until I married my husband and he supported me. I needed to see what real love was so I could come to terms with what it wasn\u2019t. \n\nNTA- but if possible, get you 2 in couples therapy. The therapist will be able to help you both navigate how to deal with the in-laws in the best way and how to navigate them bringing YOUR parents into it.", "op=NTA\n\nLet me just say OH HELL  NO!  They do not own rights to your wife.  Your wife asked you to turn down his \"request\" for her presence.   You are respecting her wishes.\n\nI'm so glad she got a good husband in marriage lottery.\n\nETA: I'm not sure how it works, if she eventually becomes a widow(do her parents get to reclaim \"custody\" of her?)  Either way, please do what you can to make sure she never has to depend on them(even if it's only because of financial not legal reasons).", "NTA. He's not changing or fixing anything by trying to force her to stay there. He's not safe, and I'm glad your wife has someone to support her in making the choice she wants.", "NTA - protecting your wife is part of being a good husband.", "NTA to begin with...but the pressing charges part makes me think the absolute safest thing for you to do is move and go completely no contact. I know the cultural obligations are really hard to overcome, but if things were bad enough to get the law involved even after the fact, you need to keep her safe above all.", "NTA but 'letting' implies that you are withholding permission for your wife to meet her parents. You are protecting her from people she is afraid of (maybe traumatized of) and who pose a present physical danger to her. I understand if she's too afraid to turn her parents down (going to assume your families are from Asia), so you, her husband, need to do so. You're supposed to protect each other.", "Do the crime do the time. NTA.", "NTA- awesome job husbanding!\n\nIn even if you believe that he or they didn't act that way towards her anymore, the trauma response she would have going there alone is not worth it.  \n\nContinue to show your wife the support that she needs after that kind of childhood.  I might go ahead and suggest therapy just because stuff like that leaves emotional baggage.\n\nYeah no, do not feel bad.", " Nta", "So they claim to want to fix the relationship they fucked up so they try to force your wife to come over and then lie to try and manipulate your family to make you cave to pressure. NTA. Keep looking out for your wife. You are doing great supporting her.", "Yes. It doesn't have to be a confrontation. These are all complete sentences.", "I would go even further and say, \u201cNot only no, but HELL no!\u201d  Screw the niceties, put your foot down, and get a protective order if necessary.", "\"Meet\" in this sense means \"get together\" not \"be introduced\". Eg \"lets meet for lunch after this meeting\"", "I think OP's use of Meet is more like \"meet up\" than \"introduced to\"", "I dont really see it as misleading. He IS \"not letting his in-laws see his wife\"... at her request. Hes asking if he's being an AH to his in-laws, not his wife. Which NTA", "Alas, true."]}
