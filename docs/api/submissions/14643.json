Granted, she needs to stand up for herself and if they raise a hand to her, DO SOMETHING about it herself.  She's an adult.  However, if she feels safer with you present, there is no reason for her to go on her own and they have no right to demand anything from her.  She's an adult.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is not a baby.
