Your sister has been harboring a major resentment against you ever since you were adopted since she was no longer the baby of the family. She couldn't wait to tell you. It was probably the best gift she could have gotten, except you ruined it by leaving the party and not having a breakdown in front of her.

Your sister is though for pulling that move. She was the baby till you came along and she is jealous of you so she bullies you with this kind of behaviour. She owes you a massive apology. That\u2019s the sort of behaviour that should have been stamped out in childhood or teens but she\u2019s still acting like a spoiled brat. You were right to point out her ingratitude over the bouquet her bf went to the trouble of picking and arranging. I actually pity her bf.\n\nI am so glad you always had a close relationship with your adopted parents and older siblings but you should have heard you were adopted from your parents.

Genetics play a huge part in that, and you should know who your parents are, even simply for the right to know if they have any genetic diseases you should be on the lookout for.   \nAnd not letting a kid the chance to meet their biological parents, or know where they came from, is straight up cruel in my books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister sounds like a psychopath, in all honesty.

What a terrible way to find out you are adopted. Shame on your parents for letting the negative spin on being adopted go unchallenged.  Shame on all of them for having zero empathy and compassion.  There is nothing bad about being adopted. There IS something bad about your family\u2019s attitude toward you.  You have a right to know about your genetic heritage. Don\u2019t expect much from these people who you call family. Please find support from people other than these. Hopefully you have extended family or friends you can reach out to. You have done nothing wrong and you do need support.", "NTA what a horrible thing to say to someone. I can't believe she used your heritage as a weapon. Firstly, that's super classist, what did she think she was accomplishing by that? Putting you down based on where or who your from. Tell her to say that to any other adopted child or person who is from a more impoverished background and ask why she feels humanly superior.\n\nSecondly you were all raised in the same household, so it's very cruel to say something like that. Why would your parents hide something like that from you and yet your siblings knew? That instantly gave them power to clearly weaponize it. And why would she say the most earth shattering thing to you during a disagreement about flowers on her birthday. I hope she reads this and you tell her this but honestly her birthday is literally a drop in the bucket compared to revealing you were adopted, and she made it about you and not the other way around. It's extremely ignorant to drop a bombshell like that on someone and expect them to smooth it over mentally and play nice for her birthday. Is she dumb or a sociopath? \n\nLastly, your parents should have found a healthy way to tell you, it could have been during childhood, teenhood or right before adulthood but honestly telling your child earlier is better, but it should be done right. What if you always felt different, or had different genetics that could have affected you and mentally you tried to force correct yourself by gaslighting yourself into thinking, well there's no history of X in my family so we can eliminate that. I'm also not saying that you would have had your bio families entire medicinal history but knowing is better than not. \n\nNTA for sure and sorry about how that happened, I think you handled it very maturely", "[removed]", "Her bf dumps her, her parents at least ground or chastise her; and she gets a flat tire on her replacement wheel", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Hiding crucial information like that definitely makes OP's parents AHs.

They justified it for her entire life, with schools and doctors and friends of the family. More people must have known she was adopted (her parents\u2019 friends, older cousins, aunts uncles) who all would have had to participate in this conspiracy of silence. Something compelled them ALL to withhold that information, and prevent anyone in her life from gossiping about it..

You deserve answers and I sincerely hope you get them.\n\nAs for your sister, I'd go NC. She's clearly toxic and enjoys hurting others - why continue a relationship with her at this point? You'd be much better without. \n\nYou can complete the 23andme or ancestry DNA kit (I've done both and rec the 23andme kit) to see if you get any hits on your immediate family.

I laughed so hard at this because it's true! \n\nThis doesn't give her an excuse to be an entitled little brat. I'm sure your parents didn't tell you to make sure you didn't feel like the odd one out as a child, but I think they should have realised this day would come that you would find out once you were a teenager. \n\nMy best advice would be don't blame your parents for not telling you, but do ask why they didn't. Explain to them that you are not angry about it, but just want to understand it from their perspective.

I know you are hurting, & they are most definitely in the wrong for not telling you sooner. But when & how to tell a child they are adopted is hard especially given your nasty sister.  I am guessing they wanted you to grow up sure of their love and of your place in the family. They didn\u2019t want your sister\u2019s insecurities to cost you your self assurance.

By not telling you, they ran the risk of you finding out in a nasty way. Also other people knew but not you, which is not fair. \n\nIn families with adoption sometimes some people try to establish a heiarchary and your sister was trying to use information she had, ABOUT YOU, against you. It seems nasty that your family kept the family secret about you, from you, then your sister wanted to abuse info about you that you should have known but didn't, to hurt you. So she hurt you by flexing on you that you'd been left out of the circle of knowledge and she wanted to make sure you discovered you were the last one to know. \n\nIt's not just you being adopted and not being told about it that's rude, but everyone else knew a secret about you except you and everyone was fine with that. And they eventually used it against you in a nasty way. Nobody wants to find out there's a huge family secret, about themselves, by having someone spring it on them spitefully, to make them feel not included. She's made a big display, of you not being included, in which the implied reason is because you're adopted. \n\nNobody adopted enjoys being placed in a family heircharchy based off blood because it's an insecure situation to be in and you're born that way and it's not your choice. Other people impose it on you. \n\nAnyways regardless of anything, it's your life. You are allowed to be angry or feel hurt. They can't tell you how you should feel. They don't know what it's like to be the family secret, and to be excluded and lied to by omission. They don't know what it's Iike to have their whole world and everything they thought they knew to be true to vanish before their very eyes and to be othered. \n\nYour sister can't know this because she can't know what it's like to be you, but finding out you're adopted in an ugly way like this also opens up a lot of personal identity questions, things she will never have to wonder about, like who are your biological relatives and what happened so that you became separated. She doesn't know what that's like and she doesn't realize how nasty it is to put that on you, in the way she did. \n\nSo now not only do you have your family make you feel bad, revealing that they've been secretive about you, but also you get to deal with the new emotions and thoughts about something that was never part of your reality. \n\nIt's a lot to think about and you're your own person independent of your family, blood or law aside, you can feel however you want to about your own situation and they can't judge because they'll never walk a mile in your shoes. \n\nRegardless of how you were born, you are here and your value and self worth isn't meant to be based off of your family associations or blood, so welcome to this earth, individual person. \u270c", "is your sister ok? that\u2019s some wild behaviour on her part.

But the full quote is actually \u2018blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb\u2019 which actually can be interpreted as your family are the people you consider to be family by choice not just those related to you.

To be perfectly honest, I still feel like I'm an outsider when I am around them, but they are the ones who raised me.\n\nCurrently, your parents and other siblings are probably in shock about how this all came out.
