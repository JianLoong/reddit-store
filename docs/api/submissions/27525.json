I'm wondering if she knows who they are because of her comment that you come from someplace bad. It's always possible your are the child of a woman who got pregnant from a upper class family who made her give you up because she brought shame on them.

They should've told you when you were a toddler, it's recommended to tell children about their adoption as soon as possible so they can grow up with that information. \n\nYour sister was obviously never accepting of you and couldn't cope. It was your parents duty to prepare their children for their new sibling, get them to therapy and work on the sibling's relationship.\n\nYour sister kept making hints for years, your parents definitely knew and still didn't say anything. It must have been clear to them that sister might reveal it one day.", "YTA\nSomeone gave you up, these people chose to take you in. You should be appreciative.

Your parents are also AHs for letting your sister bully you with this information all your life and not putting a stop to it.", "NTA It seems both of your sisters are AHs. Both of them have insulted you over the years by using the fact that you were adopted against you. Your 25f sister always said it, and now it's 28f. Keep in touch with your parents for information but cut off any sibling who thinks this behavior is OK. Permanently.", "NTA. Your sister has been harboring a major resentment against you ever since you were adopted since she was no longer the baby of the family. She couldn't wait to tell you. It was probably the best gift she could have gotten, except you ruined it by leaving the party and not having a breakdown in front of her. She probably got a talking to after you left.\n\nNow think back about all the other ways she was mean to you growing up and showed her resentment. You'll probably find that this wasn't a one time thing", "NTA, but your sister certainly is. If she didn't want attention on you she shouldn't have made it about you.

They had no choice.\"", "NTA. I am adopted and my parents never hid it from me. The fact your parents hid this from you is unfair to you. And your sister is a colossal jerk for her behavior.", "NTA. Your sister is though for pulling that move. She was the baby till you came along and she is jealous of you so she bullies you with this kind of behaviour. She owes you a massive apology. That\u2019s the sort of behaviour that should have been stamped out in childhood or teens but she\u2019s still acting like a spoiled brat. You were right to point out her ingratitude over the bouquet her bf went to the trouble of picking and arranging. I actually pity her bf.\n\nI am so glad you always had a close relationship with your adopted parents and older siblings but you should have heard you were adopted from your parents. That\u2019s on them.", "NTA  \nExcuse me?! Your sister says how YOU make everything about yourself...? She's the one putting you in the spotlight, for no other reason than to humiliate and hurt you, she's the one using her birthday to make you miserable, SHE is the one to make it all about you, you were absolutely fine with saying what you've said, and your sister's bf sounds like he's in for a miserable time if he stays with her for much longer.\n\nYour parents should have definitely told you, there are other reasons to tell a person they're adopted other than the obvious one of 'you shouldn't lie to your kid for their entire life', like, for example, medical records? Genetics play a huge part in that, and you should know who your parents are, even simply for the right to know if they have any genetic diseases you should be on the lookout for.   \nAnd not letting a kid the chance to meet their biological parents, or know where they came from, is straight up cruel in my books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister sounds like a psychopath, in all honesty. And your parents sounds borderline neglectful. But this is the internet, where dramatic judgements are being made with way too much ease, so I probably should add a disclaimer to say that I don't know your family enough to medically diagnose them, but I would say keep on the lookout for any other lies\\\\secrets they may be keeping from you.", "[removed]", "I mean you were told repeatedly throughout your life that you were adopted. You chose not to believe it. \nNTA for leaving though. \nMaybe don't comment on your sister's life.

Drivers licence ? Passport etc ?", "NTA. What a terrible way to find out you are adopted. Shame on your parents for letting the negative spin on being adopted go unchallenged.  Shame on all of them for having zero empathy and compassion.  There is nothing bad about being adopted. There IS something bad about your family\u2019s attitude toward you.  You have a right to know about your genetic heritage. Don\u2019t expect much from these people who you call family. Please find support from people other than these. Hopefully you have extended family or friends you can reach out to. You have done nothing wrong and you do need support.", "NTA what a horrible thing to say to someone. I can't believe she used your heritage as a weapon. Firstly, that's super classist, what did she think she was accomplishing by that? Putting you down based on where or who your from. Tell her to say that to any other adopted child or person who is from a more impoverished background and ask why she feels humanly superior.\n\nSecondly you were all raised in the same household, so it's very cruel to say something like that. Why would your parents hide something like that from you and yet your siblings knew? That instantly gave them power to clearly weaponize it. And why would she say the most earth shattering thing to you during a disagreement about flowers on her birthday. I hope she reads this and you tell her this but honestly her birthday is literally a drop in the bucket compared to revealing you were adopted, and she made it about you and not the other way around. It's extremely ignorant to drop a bombshell like that on someone and expect them to smooth it over mentally and play nice for her birthday. Is she dumb or a sociopath? \n\nLastly, your parents should have found a healthy way to tell you, it could have been during childhood, teenhood or right before adulthood but honestly telling your child earlier is better, but it should be done right. What if you always felt different, or had different genetics that could have affected you and mentally you tried to force correct yourself by gaslighting yourself into thinking, well there's no history of X in my family so we can eliminate that. I'm also not saying that you would have had your bio families entire medicinal history but knowing is better than not. \n\nNTA for sure and sorry about how that happened, I think you handled it very maturely", "[removed]", "Her bf dumps her, her parents at least ground or chastise her; and she gets a flat tire on her replacement wheel", "[removed]", "The need to leave to process this huge revelation is understandable.

They justified it for her entire life, with schools and doctors and friends of the family. More people must have known she was adopted (her parents\u2019 friends, older cousins, aunts uncles) who all would have had to participate in this conspiracy of silence. Something compelled them ALL to withhold that information, and prevent anyone in her life from gossiping about it..
