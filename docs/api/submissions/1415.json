Especially if they showed no sign of seeing you or slowing. Although once they did slow to stop, you could have finished crossing instead of wait until they stopped to tell you to go.", "Dont know if this effects your judgement but because it was a straight road i\\`m pretty certain they saw me but thought i could get across  and didnt need to slow down and by the time i saw the car and stopped and them slowing down they was close enough where finishing crossing would had be dangerous and the driver would had to brake harder"]}
