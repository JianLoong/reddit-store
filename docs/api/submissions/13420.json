Make sure she knows she's loved and accepted.\n\nAlso, surrogacy doesn't mean she's not related (genetically) normally, it depends on the way it's done, in this instance it sounds like your parents used either doner eggs or sperm, but if she was done through IVF of your parents gunk - then she IS one of you, so this is doubly stupid to say - your parents just rented a womb.\n\nEdit: for clarity, it's most likely she's still BIOLOGICALLY your half sister, and if not, don't be an AH.", "YTA.  That\u2019s a terrible thing to say to a 6YO.  Also she is a surrogate, that means she shares the same DNA as your parents.

You aren\u2019t her parent so you should probably STFU about stuff like this.\n\nFYI - surrogacy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that doctors didn\u2019t use both parents\u2019 genetic material in embryo creation.

Being honest isn't an excuse for being mean and your intentions are irrelevant. Timing is everything with sensitive topics like these and how the information is delivered to her can greatly impact the rest of her life. You can't understand because the mother who is raising you birthed you. And if you feel confident enough to say that being told your mother didn't birth you wouldn't bother you, then good on your parents for raising you to be secure in your identity. You didn't even allow that for your sister. You just threw that information on your sister so unsympathetically. Also, if she's a surrogate through IVF, then she has half of your father's DNA just like you. So she is like you genetically, epigenetically, socially, culturally, the list goes on.", "YTA\n\nShe's 6 and how is she supposed to take it any other than her older brother saying she's not really part of the family and basically an outsider?", "YTA - that\u2019s just cruelty to an innocent 6 year old.", "<<I just told her \"you're not fully one of us\", no malice intent or anything.>>\n\n<<i mean it when I say there was no bad intention behind it.>>\n\nYou're lying, either to us or yourself. \n\nI want you to know that I think this behavior was despicable and YTA. But I say this without malice. \n\nAlso, surrogacy does not always mean the child has different DNA than children more typically conceived. A surrogate can carry a bio mom's eggs, fertilized by the bio dad's sperm.  I don't know what was the case in your family, but you act as if children don't have the same DNA if one is carried by surrogacy ... that's simply not always the case.", "YTA. \n\nThis wasn't your news to tell. \n\nYou think there was no malice or ill intent, but you're basically \"othering\" your kid sister. Of course she got upset. She's 6!  \n\nEven with surrogacy, she's still your sibling.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, you chose language that excluded her. She's six years old. How do you think she's going to feel when, at that young, vulnerable age, the people that she is forced to trust to protect and care for her aren't even hers? You basically told her that she's not family.\n\nI don't blame your mother and brother one iota for their assessment of you.\n\nSecond, no one was asking ***you*** anything. You should have let your mother handle this. She could have postponed telling Bella the truth and just said, \"Sometimes that happens.\" And leave it at that. Then she could address the subject with her when she's older, explaining the process of surrogacy.\n\nChoose your words carefully in the future, and let your parents handle the sensitive issues.", "YTA and you had better start telling your sister every single day that you love her and are so proud and happy that she is your sister.  I mean, Every.  Single.  Day.  \n\n If you think family is determined only by DNA, then, yeah, YTA and have a lot of catching up to do with reality.  \n\nAnd if, by chance, you said this because you resent her for taking the baby of the family position away from her, well, you're old enough to have gotten over that, and it's a totally clich\u00e9 way to think and behave.  You've had 6 years to get over that if it's an issue. \n\nYou're also old enough to know how girls struggle with self-esteem in most societies around the world and she's Your Sister so you should be looking out for her and building her up to be strong and confident in a hostile world.  \n\nSo, I repeat:  tell her you love her and are proud and happy she is your sister.  Every.  Single.  Day.", "YTA, albeit unintentional. Truly, you embodied the word \"thoughtless\" because you didn't think AT ALL how that comment might have been received by little Bella. I can't tell whether your parents shared the story of the surrogacy with her yet, but from her and your mother's reaction, I'm guessing not, so you are also TA because that's not your story to share, even though to you it's just a normal part of the family history. This is a great example of the need to think before you speak.", "YTA and I know other people have already addressed this, but \"surrogacy\" itself is not an explanation for why she wouldn't have the same DNA as the rest of you. splitting hairs over DNA isn't why you're the asshole, though. It's that you thought it was in any way appropriate to tell your very very young sister that she wasn't fully a part of the family.", "YTA\n\n>I mean it when I say there was no bad intention behind it\n\nSo you agree, even adults would think you said this will malice. So how do you think a 6-year-old would feel? \n\n>Bella was bound to know in the future anyway so what was the harm of telling her now\n\nHer parents would do it with tact, and there would be no tears, unlike your blunt statement.", "This can\u2019t be real, right? You cannot have told your sister that she isn\u2019t one of you and think that you\u2019re not an absolute monster. At best, you have a serious lack of empathy and need to be seeing a therapist immediately. At worst, you just don\u2019t care and wanted to see what kind of shock value you could get. \nEither way MASSIVE YTA.", "YTA. That was a really bad way to word that, and also not your place. I believe that if you call someone your sibling, they are \"fully\" one of you. It doesn't matter if it's blood or not, it's the love put into it. My dad had 4 kids, my mom 3, and they got married and had me. I never say half-sister or half-brother. They are my brother and sisters. You made her feel like less than. That's never ok.", "Genetically you may be closer to your family than your sister. But when it comes to compassion and empathy and love, you\u2019re clearly the outsider. YTA", "\"Bella was bound to know in the future so what was the harm of telling her now?\"\n\nWell, she's bound to try alcohol and tobacco in the future, so what's the harm of trying it now? The harm is that at an age it's inappropriate and way more harmful than at an older age. Also, there's ways to break down the news. \"you're not one of us\" at 6 from your \"sister\" is not the same as \"we really wanted a daughter, but had complications conceiving, so we had some medical help, and that's why you look a bit different. It doesn't change how much we love you.\" from your mom and dad, say, at 14.\n\nYou're 17 years old, so you should know better. \n\nYTA", "YTA she's 6 you don't tell her that, you just put her in years of therapy.  Can you blame her for avoiding you, she thinks you don't love her or even care for her. It's like telling her Santa isn't real.", "Why would you do that? WTF", "yes, YTA. how do you expect a 6 year-old to process and react to that? also, you're wrong if she has your parents' genetic material.", "YTA. Think before you speak to a 6-year-old.", "YTA!! How could you do this to a little girl :(", "you suck to YTA (by accident).\n\nI don't think you meant for it to come accross the way you did but you might have accidentally told your sister that she wasn't your sister (at least fully).  Your sister is 6 years old and doesn't comprehend the method that was used to conceive her, she probably only understands that she has a mom, a dad, & siblings.  by revealing the truth in the manor you did, she may have understood what you said as \"she is not fully a part of your family\" and she's processing that information in a way that only a young child can.\n\nWhen she is feeling better apologize to her, hug her, and tell her she will always be your sister.  And when she is old enough, perhaps you should explain the process of surrogacy and why it doesn't take away from her status as a family member.", "\nYTA, \u201cyou\u2019re not fully one of us\u201d was a mean thing to say.

What you said basically excluded and 'othered' her... and showcased what a mean, narrow-minded person you are. It was totally not your place to answer that question while your mother was present and could do it in a far more sensitive way.

I do agree it was up to the mom and dad to decide when to tell her. If nothing else, at least word it that she looks special because someone helped her join their family.

So mom found a nice person to help your sister come, so that you guys could have the cute little baby sister that you have now.\n\nMost of that to say, she is six.

It depends on the surrogacy, but they can use your mom's ovum and your dad's sperm so that you sister is genetically \"**one of you**\".  So, not only are you out of line, but you may be giving incorrect information.  It is partially your parents' fault for not coaching you in advance.\n\nBut this can be fixed.

And chances are she will never ever forget it. \n\nHow would you like it if you joined a sports team and your teammate said to you \u201cYou\u2019re not one of us\u201d? Or if you went to college and joined a fraternity, and one of your frat brothers said \u201cYou\u2019re not one of us\u201d? What if you got hired by a company and your coworker said \u201cYou\u2019re not one of us\u201d? What if you got engaged, and your future in-laws said to you, \u201cYou\u2019re not one of us\u201d?  I bet you would feel shitty, which is how you made your sister feel. \n\nYou aren\u2019t 8 years old; you are 17 and should know better by now. \n\nYTA big-time", "Yta", "Are you asking this as a serious question? You legitimately don\u2019t know how much of an AH you are???", "YTA\n\n\nEven IF its surrogacy with donated egg/sperm why the hell would you say that?!", "Mean.  That\u2019s what that comment was.  Were your trying to hurt her?  Because your \u201cno offense\u201d disclaimer was bullshit.  I bet your jealous.  YTA", "YTA Even if your parents used a donor egg and donor sperm- she's still \"one of you.\"\n\ni don't know if really didn't mean anything by it or you are still annoyed that your parents had another kid when you were 11 or feel that this is the child that your parents really wanted because they went to all of this effort to get her- but that wasn't the best choice of words and you knew it.\n\nyou need to put on your grown up panties, apologize to your little sister and assure her that of course she is- and will always- be your little sister. and hope that you can undo some of the damage that you've done.", "YTA", "YTA your brothers right you should be ashamed. She may be 6 but I doubt she'll never forget how you made her feel like she wasn't really part of the family", "YTA, and a pretty terrible one at that. Get some help, apologize endlessly to your sister. Truly, how DARE you. I\u2019m adopted, as 3 of my siblings \u2014 guess what? NO ONE IN OUR FAMILY BRINGS IT UP TO HURT US OR REALLY EVER, because it DOESNT MATTER, WE ARE FAMILY. \n\n\nThis post made my skin crawl more than most, because you maliciously verbally attacked a little girl. You are the kind of human who deserves every bit of karma coming your way.", "YTA\n\nThis is not a conversation anyone should have with a 6 year old, and it is not a conversation that you should have ever been part of at all, regardless of whether she is genetically your sister or half sister or not.", "YTA and I think it's gonna be my first time when I won't even bother to give you an explanation why. Exact what you did to your little sister.", "YTA.  This is a really heartless, callous way to explain surrogacy to a 6-year-old.  She is very much one of  your family regardless of her genetic heritage (and there are a variety of forms of surrogacy, I can't tell if she is genetically related to one or both of your parents by virtue of your post.)  I'm guessing from what you say that she didn't yet know that she was conceived via surrogacy?  It REALLY wasn't your place to step in here if that was the case, although this is definitely something that your parents should tell her- in an accurate, compassionate way, not by being a dick about it.", "This is awful. The whole situation and the fact people still believe surrogacy is morally right. It is buying babies. PERIOD. YTA but your parents are too for exploiting a woman and buying a human life. There is no right selfless surrogacy, it is plain slavery whitewashed. Having babies isn't a human right.", "She's 6 years old, bro.\n\nYou're gonna have to make it your mission to make her feel part of the family for the rest of your life. Because she *is* part of your family. None of this \"you're not one of us\" foolishness. \n\nYTA.\n\nAlso, let me just say, family tree type projects at a young age are so damn messy because you know damn well at least ONE of your students are gonna find out something traumatizing.", "I thought that too, but it could be that the mother didn\u2019t have enough viable eggs due to aging and so the egg came from the surrogate too.", "Bahahahaha the parents wanted a kid they could really love!", "Yeah I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019d be upset if one of my 3 little half sisters said this to me", "They can also use donated egg or sperm or both, in surrogacy.", "ikr, how did OP say all that and not even get grounded??", "It depends on the type of surrogacy. \n\nOften times surrogacy is done just you are describing- gestational surrogacy. Basically doctors do normal IVF but they put an embryo into a third-party. However, there are times that surrogacy is used with an embryo that\u2019s created through a donor sperm or donor egg, in which case they would not be fully biologically related.", "Not necessarily. Surrogacy can involve different egg donors and sperm donors. It\u2019s possible the genetic material came from only of the parents, or even neither. Answering because I haven\u2019t seen OP answer questions yet, but doesn\u2019t change that OP is the AH even if they aren\u2019t biologically related.", "That's what I thought? \n\nInfo: OP are you sure your sister was born via surrogacy? If so, then she would be genetically your sister as well.", "Exactly this. Unless op's parents said they used a sperm bank or an egg donor, Bella is 100% related to them. YTA", "Agree your sister is fully part of the family.", "If you want to maybe help fix this, possibly get a family item. A locket, a bracelet, something simply she can safely wear and take care of. Give her one, and you and your parents/older sibling can wear one too. A super special family item. Talk it up and make it fun. Take her out on a you budget friendly \u2018sibling day\u2019 and maybe encourage your parents to take just her out in a special day just for themselves so they can try to help re bond.\n\nEdit: I cannot spell apparently. Lol", "I mean, if this child is donor conceived, she should be told, just like if she was adopted. So hopefully OP is just confused about the science instead of their parents doing something damaging.", "He came here asking for judgement so if he can say \"messed up stuff\" to his sibling then he can accept being called an AH", "The egg and the sperm could have potentially come from donors and the resulting embryo implanted in a surrogate. Brave New World.", "OP is definitely an AH. Just the few couples I know who have gone the surrogacy route we\u2019re still biologically related to their children, so I just didn\u2019t think of the other alternatives! I just don\u2019t know a whole lot about surrogacy as my BIL and SIL were very limited with what was shared during their experience."]}
