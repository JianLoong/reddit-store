They must have been so disappointed with how you turned out that they did whatever they had to for another chance.", "YTA. Your sister is six.  She doesn\u2019t understand that you meant no harm.

It was not your place and you should have known better than to tell her this information without asking your parents first. There is nothing wrong with being a child from surrogacy but it was not your call to make.", "YTA - Your sister is 6 and you expect her to understand DNA? Make sure she knows she's loved and accepted.\n\nAlso, surrogacy doesn't mean she's not related (genetically) normally, it depends on the way it's done, in this instance it sounds like your parents used either doner eggs or sperm, but if she was done through IVF of your parents gunk - then she IS one of you, so this is doubly stupid to say - your parents just rented a womb.\n\nEdit: for clarity, it's most likely she's still BIOLOGICALLY your half sister, and if not, don't be an AH.", "YTA.  That\u2019s a terrible thing to say to a 6YO.  Also she is a surrogate, that means she shares the same DNA as your parents.  Like they take the fertilized egg from your mom, and sperm from your dad, so she still shares 100% dna as your parents.", "Wow you are an absolute AH. You aren\u2019t her parent so you should probably STFU about stuff like this.\n\nFYI - surrogacy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that doctors didn\u2019t use both parents\u2019 genetic material in embryo creation.

So based on your comment ,I\u2019m assuming that either donor sperm or donor eggs were used and you know this for a fact\u2026\n\nRegardless, you\u2019re still TA.", "YTA, you're definitely an asshole. Being honest isn't an excuse for being mean and your intentions are irrelevant. Timing is everything with sensitive topics like these and how the information is delivered to her can greatly impact the rest of her life. You can't understand because the mother who is raising you birthed you. And if you feel confident enough to say that being told your mother didn't birth you wouldn't bother you, then good on your parents for raising you to be secure in your identity. You didn't even allow that for your sister. You just threw that information on your sister so unsympathetically. Also, if she's a surrogate through IVF, then she has half of your father's DNA just like you. So she is like you genetically, epigenetically, socially, culturally, the list goes on.", "YTA\n\nShe's 6 and how is she supposed to take it any other than her older brother saying she's not really part of the family and basically an outsider?", "YTA - that\u2019s just cruelty to an innocent 6 year old.", "<<I just told her \"you're not fully one of us\", no malice intent or anything.>>\n\n<<i mean it when I say there was no bad intention behind it.>>\n\nYou're lying, either to us or yourself. \n\nI want you to know that I think this behavior was despicable and YTA. But I say this without malice. \n\nAlso, surrogacy does not always mean the child has different DNA than children more typically conceived. A surrogate can carry a bio mom's eggs, fertilized by the bio dad's sperm.  I don't know what was the case in your family, but you act as if children don't have the same DNA if one is carried by surrogacy ... that's simply not always the case.", "YTA. \n\nThis wasn't your news to tell. \n\nYou think there was no malice or ill intent, but you're basically \"othering\" your kid sister. Of course she got upset. She's 6!  \n\nEven with surrogacy, she's still your sibling.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, you chose language that excluded her. She's six years old. How do you think she's going to feel when, at that young, vulnerable age, the people that she is forced to trust to protect and care for her aren't even hers? You basically told her that she's not family.\n\nI don't blame your mother and brother one iota for their assessment of you.\n\nSecond, no one was asking ***you*** anything. You should have let your mother handle this. She could have postponed telling Bella the truth and just said, \"Sometimes that happens.\" And leave it at that. Then she could address the subject with her when she's older, explaining the process of surrogacy.\n\nChoose your words carefully in the future, and let your parents handle the sensitive issues.", "YTA and you had better start telling your sister every single day that you love her and are so proud and happy that she is your sister.  I mean, Every.  Single.  Day.  \n\n If you think family is determined only by DNA, then, yeah, YTA and have a lot of catching up to do with reality.  \n\nAnd if, by chance, you said this because you resent her for taking the baby of the family position away from her, well, you're old enough to have gotten over that, and it's a totally clich\u00e9 way to think and behave.  You've had 6 years to get over that if it's an issue. \n\nYou're also old enough to know how girls struggle with self-esteem in most societies around the world and she's Your Sister so you should be looking out for her and building her up to be strong and confident in a hostile world.  \n\nSo, I repeat:  tell her you love her and are proud and happy she is your sister.  Every.  Single.  Day.", "YTA, albeit unintentional. Truly, you embodied the word \"thoughtless\" because you didn't think AT ALL how that comment might have been received by little Bella. I can't tell whether your parents shared the story of the surrogacy with her yet, but from her and your mother's reaction, I'm guessing not, so you are also TA because that's not your story to share, even though to you it's just a normal part of the family history. This is a great example of the need to think before you speak.", "YTA and I know other people have already addressed this, but \"surrogacy\" itself is not an explanation for why she wouldn't have the same DNA as the rest of you. splitting hairs over DNA isn't why you're the asshole, though. It's that you thought it was in any way appropriate to tell your very very young sister that she wasn't fully a part of the family.", "YTA\n\n>I mean it when I say there was no bad intention behind it\n\nSo you agree, even adults would think you said this will malice. So how do you think a 6-year-old would feel? \n\n>Bella was bound to know in the future anyway so what was the harm of telling her now\n\nHer parents would do it with tact, and there would be no tears, unlike your blunt statement.", "This can\u2019t be real, right? You cannot have told your sister that she isn\u2019t one of you and think that you\u2019re not an absolute monster. At best, you have a serious lack of empathy and need to be seeing a therapist immediately. At worst, you just don\u2019t care and wanted to see what kind of shock value you could get. \nEither way MASSIVE YTA.", "YTA. That was a really bad way to word that, and also not your place. I believe that if you call someone your sibling, they are \"fully\" one of you. It doesn't matter if it's blood or not, it's the love put into it. My dad had 4 kids, my mom 3, and they got married and had me. I never say half-sister or half-brother. They are my brother and sisters. You made her feel like less than. That's never ok.", "Genetically you may be closer to your family than your sister. But when it comes to compassion and empathy and love, you\u2019re clearly the outsider. YTA", "\"Bella was bound to know in the future so what was the harm of telling her now?\"\n\nWell, she's bound to try alcohol and tobacco in the future, so what's the harm of trying it now? The harm is that at an age it's inappropriate and way more harmful than at an older age. Also, there's ways to break down the news. \"you're not one of us\" at 6 from your \"sister\" is not the same as \"we really wanted a daughter, but had complications conceiving, so we had some medical help, and that's why you look a bit different. It doesn't change how much we love you.\" from your mom and dad, say, at 14.\n\nYou're 17 years old, so you should know better. \n\nYTA", "YTA she's 6 you don't tell her that, you just put her in years of therapy.  Can you blame her for avoiding you, she thinks you don't love her or even care for her. It's like telling her Santa isn't real.", "Why would you do that? WTF", "yes, YTA. how do you expect a 6 year-old to process and react to that? also, you're wrong if she has your parents' genetic material.", "YTA. Think before you speak to a 6-year-old.", "YTA!! How could you do this to a little girl :(", "you suck to YTA (by accident).\n\nI don't think you meant for it to come accross the way you did but you might have accidentally told your sister that she wasn't your sister (at least fully).  Your sister is 6 years old and doesn't comprehend the method that was used to conceive her, she probably only understands that she has a mom, a dad, & siblings.  by revealing the truth in the manor you did, she may have understood what you said as \"she is not fully a part of your family\" and she's processing that information in a way that only a young child can.\n\nWhen she is feeling better apologize to her, hug her, and tell her she will always be your sister.  And when she is old enough, perhaps you should explain the process of surrogacy and why it doesn't take away from her status as a family member.", "\nYTA, \u201cyou\u2019re not fully one of us\u201d was a mean thing to say. Regardless of intent, your words were just rude.

YTA. You are old enough to know better, and to have let your mother handle this sensitive issue. What you said basically excluded and 'othered' her... and showcased what a mean, narrow-minded person you are. It was totally not your place to answer that question while your mother was present and could do it in a far more sensitive way. I've no full siblings, only halves and steps, and this is the kind of bullshit behavior that makes a person feel like they don't fit in or belong.

YTA", "If i was your parents i\u2019d be ashamed of you. 17 years old and you don\u2019t have the tact to even think or care about how your words can impact a 6 year old.

You say \"made a little different\" or \"magic science\".\n\nMaybe she's better off not being one of you", "YTA", "Gonna add in a YTA. She is one of you. I do agree it was up to the mom and dad to decide when to tell her. If nothing else, at least word it that she looks special because someone helped her join their family. Mom really wanted your sister, but she just wasn\u2019t ready to come. So mom found a nice person to help your sister come, so that you guys could have the cute little baby sister that you have now.\n\nMost of that to say, she is six. She is not ready for complex birth complications and adoption/surrogacy talks. She is one of you, no matter how she came to be that way.

Your parents weren't going to share that info with a 10 year old and probably still have not shared it. \n\nSecond, you told a 6 year old that she isn't really part of your family.\n\nOf course you're the asshole, what would ever make you think giving information that isn't yours, is ok to tell a SIX YEAR OLD?!?", "**YTA (mild)** \\- That is the job of the parents to discuss that.  It depends on the surrogacy, but they can use your mom's ovum and your dad's sperm so that you sister is genetically \"**one of you**\".  So, not only are you out of line, but you may be giving incorrect information.  It is partially your parents' fault for not coaching you in advance.\n\nBut this can be fixed.  Apologize, give her love, and be sure you find out the story your parents are telling and stick to it.", "Major YTA! It doesn't matter if your intention weren't bad. You can't be this dense.

Also, that isn\u2019t what surrogacy is. It would be very odd for your parents to have a surrogate, egg donor, and sperm donor. Are you sure she isn\u2019t your bio sister?", "Then why not say a donor was used?", "She\u2019s 48 and kid is 6 so she\u2019d be 42 when trying to have bub.  Plus they may have extracted eggs even earlier - there\u2019s still a chance it was her eggs\n\nMy aunt fell pregnant naturally at 43", "She knows there is something different about her, that's why she is asking.  She needed answers but your delivery was terrible.", "Unless the parents told their children this OP has no confirmation that any outside eggs or sperm were used.", "I really doubt it, it\u2019s incredibly rare to use a surrogates egg for ethical reasons. Sure they could have used a donor egg or sperm, but that\u2019s the IVF part of the procedure and has basically nothing to do with surrogacy. It\u2019s pretty clear that OP has zero idea what he\u2019s talking about.", "Definitely an AH but you guys are basically crucifying him for doing something kids his age do, he obviously feels bad. Take it easy.", "I\u2019m going through this now. You can get donated sperm or eggs or get a donated embryo. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a world in which I\u2019d want my egg donor and my surrogate to be the same person. I\u2019d like to make sure my surrogate has no claim whatsoever, but there is a chance that the baby was a donated/ adopted embryo carried by a surrogate\u2026. Still no less a full fledge family member. You don\u2019t work that hard for a kid just to think of it as someone else\u2019s.", "I think that's gonna be location and situation dependent.\n\nI know my province treats surrogacy the same whether the baby is biologically related to the surrogate or not (she's the legal mother and needs to relinquish her parental rights in both cases). So it must happen.\n\nEgg harvesting is an invasive and expensive procedure. Surrogate has already agreed to undergo invasive procedures and carry the baby for 9 months. In some places/cases, it's probably easier than hunting down a separate source of eggs.", "It can be. You don\u2019t use the surrogates egg because then she has legal claim to baby, but it\u2019s not uncommon to use a donor egg and either dads sperm or donor sperm and have it birthed by a surrogate. We have friends that did donor eggs and dad sperm via surrogate (mom has genetic illnesses). They have twins that don\u2019t look like them nor do they look like each other. It\u2019s a wild world out there in baby making land. \nYTA x 10000\u2019s, your poor sister.", "You guys act like people wouldn't have immediately made that clear if it was the case.  If they were biologically full siblings the vast majority of the time they aren't going to look different than everyone in the family.\n\nSo if kid is crying because she isn't part of the family, it's very easy to fix that \"your sister is just stupid and doesn't know what a surrogate is you are 100% mommy and daddies baby its okay.\"", "LOL i havent voted a judgement yet but just responded to you.", "Where I live she would have a claim even if your eggs were used. \n\nThe nitty gritty of surrogacy varies wildly from place to place.", "It may be logistically easier for the person looking for a baby.\n\nBut it's a different prospect entirely from renting out your womb, or even selling your eggs. It's being pregnant with and birthing your own genetic child. \n\nIt's also a lot less effective to just try and naturally impregnate the surrogate, rather than using fertilised embryos. So the surrogate would have to endure an entirely separate set of procedures to harvest eggs. Which take another huge toll on their body.", "Is it really that different? I would think the whole being pregnant for 9 months and not keeping the baby to be the bigger hurdle, regardless of genetics.", "Yes. It definitely is. You're giving birth, but it's not your baby. This would be your baby. It's totally different."]}
