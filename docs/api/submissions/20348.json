So for those saying I should really push for 3 ways or not go in the room with them, its already been split haha. The wedding is in a week!

Either way we\u2019re definitely not going to be splitting it like this, we are going to split it 3 ways, my friend is just annoyed by it!

So if the room was $200, I would be paying 100, they would each pay 50. This way it\u2019s 66 per person. Plus I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be punished for being the third person, it was all of our idea to share a room to save the money \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0feither way though my friend isn\u2019t that mad about it, I just wasn\u2019t sure if I was in the wrong.", "Because a lot of people legitimately think that being in a romantic relationship magically makes them a single unit that are literally attached at the hip.", "I\u2019m definitely not planning on getting another room, we\u2019ve already split the bill 3 ways.

They pay 3/5 and you pay 2/5. This means they pay 60% and you pay 40%. Having to share a bed is not as nice as having one to yourself. I do agree that it shouldn't just be split in 2. There's a certain point where you might want to avoid causing unnecessary drama. NAH - everyone agreeing is the important thing so no one's TA.", "Or at least that one bed(room) = one share, like they're not using an equal share of communal space, tv, showers etc per person .", "NTA. It really irritates me when couples think they should be treated as one person. 3 people using the product means 3 people pay.", "I meant it more like, them being there is not the same as only one more person being there, so it should be a three-way split. Have fun!", "Your friend was being obnoxious. You could have offered for her to share your bed and make him pay half. Of course she wouldn\u2019t accept but that\u2019s a scenario too."]}
