He\u2019s young so he wants to have a lot of children plus he comes from a culture where children are a major factor in marriage. He said he wants at least 3 kids. At first I thought after a while of dating my sister would tell her partner that she can\u2019t give birth without major risked. She could literally die. She never did, now they are planning the wedding. When me and my other siblings confronted her she said that she\u2019s willing to take the risk and that she wants more kids. I don\u2019t agree with this because if she dies she leaves behind her already living son. So when my family was having dinner this Christmas I decided to bring up my sister\u2019s surgery and the risk of getting pregnant. She left soon after cursing me out and yelling that I\u2019m a lier. Her fianc\u00e9 yelled at me, saying that surgery isn\u2019t something I should lie about and how an immature teen doesn\u2019t understand what the risk of pregnancy.

If this is the case, it could've required complicated surgery to remove the initial chest tumor, the area it spread to, and the lung itself.\n\nA lung removal surgery is called a pneumonectomy. Google says that this involves an incision into a person's side and would require breaking ribs if there are cancerous tumors that need to be removed.\n\nTo simplify, the sister could've gotten her body cracked like an egg to get the yoke out but the yoke was a lung.

She wants to give birth again.\n\nWhether it's with this man, a different man, or from a sperm donor, the sister is going to get pregnant again.", "So being almost 30 and closer to the OP\u2019s sister\u2019s age makes me a child now? You are thankful you dont have family that would do anything and everything in their power to keep you from dying? From leaving your kid an orphan? Jeez", "Sure, doesn\u2019t change the fact that when OP brought up the surgery, her sister denied any surgery ever occurring, and then her husband accused OP of lying. I\u2019m just repeating what\u2019s in the post.", "Do you know this for a fact?  Do you know that they haven't talked about her surgery?", "Yes.  She did it cause she's 18, and like the vast majority of 18 year olds she has all the answers.", "It makes you a busy body who clearly has learned nothing and life and is hypocritical enough to believe in \"my body my choice\"... but only as long as the choice being made is the right one.\n\nI rarely state that things would make me walk away from a person... it takes a lot... but the moment you decided you had the right to supplant your judgment for mine, you'd be out of my life.  Permanently.", "I'm aware.  I'm also not 100% sure I believe the OP.  And if she is telling the truth the \"lie\" could have been the inability to have children.  \n\nBut regardless of whether the sister is lying or not, I'm unaware of any \"truth police\" positions being offered to 18 year old little sisters.", "So now i have learned nothing of life because I think it\u2019s stupid and irresponsible to throw your life away just to give birth? It\u2019s called having common sense. Im all up for your body your choice until your choice is suicidal and its not even because you are in excruciating pain with a chronic disease that will anyways kill you, is just because you want to be pregnant. It\u2019s ridiculous.  \n\nBtw we are ALL busy bodies here, we are discussing an strangers life ffs \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: because you edited the second part of your comment. In this case OP didn\u2019t even \u201csupplant\u201d her judgement with her sister\u2019s she just talked about the risks and informed their fianc\u00e9. You wouldnt talk to me? Boo freaking hoo, at least you would be alive raising your son and not being buried for nothing.", "Again, I was just repeated what the post said, which is that OP brought up the surgery and the risks of getting pregnant bc of it, not that she said her sister \u201ccouldn\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d That\u2019s was the title being misleading. Then the quote about the lid was that the sisters husband said \u201csurgery isn\u2019t something to lie about,\u201d so she was being accused of lying about the surgery, not about her sister being able to get pregnant. And one doesn\u2019t need to be the \u201ctruth police\u201d to recognize that lying to your husband about your medical history and how it may affect any future pregnancies/births is a super fucked up and selfish thing to do. I don\u2019t think this dinner was a good time to bring it up though. They just threw gas on the fire by bringing it up the way they did IMO", "There is no way given the scar that the sister denied any surgery ever occurring.  \n\nGod redditors need to use logic once in awhile."]}
