My sister has one son from a previous marriage but after giving birth the hospital found a tumor in her chest. She had gotten it removed but she lost a lung in the process. Now onto the problem, after a messy divorce, my sister found a man that\u2019s much younger than she is. He\u2019s young so he wants to have a lot of children plus he comes from a culture where children are a major factor in marriage. He said he wants at least 3 kids. At first I thought after a while of dating my sister would tell her partner that she can\u2019t give birth without major risked. She could literally die. She never did, now they are planning the wedding. When me and my other siblings confronted her she said that she\u2019s willing to take the risk and that she wants more kids. I don\u2019t agree with this because if she dies she leaves behind her already living son. So when my family was having dinner this Christmas I decided to bring up my sister\u2019s surgery and the risk of getting pregnant. She left soon after cursing me out and yelling that I\u2019m a lier. Her fianc\u00e9 yelled at me, saying that surgery isn\u2019t something I should lie about and how an immature teen doesn\u2019t understand what the risk of pregnancy. My siblings agree with me mentioning it but my parents think that I should\u2019ve never said anything. AITAH??\n\nEdit:Hi. I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about certain information I forgot to share. my family all know that he doesn\u2019t know, my sister asked us to help her hide it and told us.We know there is a high chance she probably die from giving birth, a doctor explained it and told us the risk after her surgery and advised my sister to find alternative ways. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 have been together for almost four years now. My sister does have other underlying things like diabetes as well as a problem with her heart(I don\u2019t know the name of the problem but I know she has it) which is why she almost dies during her surgery. She had also almost dies giving birth to my nephew. I had never told her she can\u2019t have kids, I am sorry the title is wrong I had thought Cant and shouldn\u2019t mean the same thing in English. Me and my family have told her that she should tell him but she is pushing it off. I don\u2019t want to ruin their relationship but she should tell him because of the risk. I know she only wants a family because he wants a family she had explained that to us when we asked her to tell him. My sister is amazing she just didn\u2019t tell him. I worry about her dying from birth.", "created_utc": 1703776426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sw632/aitah_for_telling_my_sisters_fianc\u00e9_that_she_cant/", "score": 1124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if your partner dies, then you may be in the awkward position of being the socially-expected single parent of the said child that dislikes you.\n2) If said partner dies from child-birth, one may irrationally feel responsible for their death. And even if you don't, the stepchild very likely WILL blame you for their bio parent's death. \n3) While she is not literally sterile/infertile, she may as well be. She can never give her fiance the life/family that is of paramount importance to him.
