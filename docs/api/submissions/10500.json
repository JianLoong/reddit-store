Her life is a train wreck and he helped her out a couple of times because her mother was his brother's HS gf. That was it. He had no relationship with her, and I'm just tired of seeing her post about him how sad she is since he died two years ago, how much she misses him. I'd met her before, and knew that she was a badge bunny, but my husband was definitely not into her at all.

I completely understand why you feel this way but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to ask her to stop.\n\nMy late husband\u2019s niece does this same thing. He barely knew her (he didn\u2019t particularly like her because she did some shitty things to us) and they rarely spent any time together, but after he passed she seemed to suddenly develop this fondness of him that she\u2019d plaster all over social media. I agree that it feels so fake and attention-whory, but it\u2019s how she\u2019s dealing with this loss and it\u2019s not my place to decide whether it\u2019s genuine or not.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, she does this same thing about a friend who died years ago. The girl\u2019s family has commented multiple times asking her to stop posting this stuff, but she still does, and it\u2019s been like 10 years. So even if you did ask her to stop, it may make no difference and you\u2019ll be seen as someone trying to control how someone else grieves.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, but I think the best you can do is block her and focus on your own wellbeing through this process.", "Why don't you just block her? Asking her to stop might not work and in any case, I don't understand why it bothers you so much. You say that her life is a train wreck...So consider, maybe her train wreck life is so devoid of a good people that your husband had a tremendous impact.  \n\nSoft YTA because your grief might be making you over react.", "Info: how old are you? And How often does she post about your husband?", "I'm sorry to learn of the death of your husband.  You are grieving.\n\nYWBTA for confronting or asking   \"the child\" to stop posting about your husband. Blocking or unfriending them is a better, and healthier alternative for you.\n\nYour emotions are valid. They are also raw. This person means nothing to you. That's obvious from your post. You can't assign emotions to them though.  Their feelings may be legitimate. Your husband may have been one of the few people that they trusted and knew that they could truly count on. I don't know anyone evolved.\n\nBlock, unfriend, stop checking. Concentrate on yourself and your own well-being. Take all the time that you need to grieve. Try to surround yourself with support and love.", "As I am reading this, I'm reminded that anger is a natural part of grief.  It seems like maybe this is some displaced anger you need to work through. YWBTA if you take it out on her though.", "This was hard to follow.  Your husband died 2 years ago and before he died, he helped out a young girl.

Stop focusing on her posts and deal with your own grief.", "You commented that she\u2019s in her early 20s. I think you\u2019re so angry because some part of you thinks she had sexual/romantic feelings for him. The fact that you called her a \u201cbadge bunny\u201d also makes me think this.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve called her multiple degrading names just in this very short post, up to dehumanizing her by calling her \u201cThis child\u201d Seems like you have some internal issues to work on, Maybe time to talk to your therapist about it. \n\nIf she\u2019s \u201cThis child\u201d then she was no threat to your marriage, If they hadn\u2019t talked in months and your husband never messaged her then you shouldn\u2019t have ever perceived her as a threat.

But you\u2019d be a total fool to engage with her. Like, what exactly do you envision happening if you did? If she\u2019s sincere, you\u2019re just being mean to a grieving person. If she\u2019s *not* sincere, she won\u2019t care and will just use it as a method for creating more drama.", "YTA - Just block her?

I don\u2019t understand all the YTA votes. This woman is making OP\u2019s husband\u2019s death all about herself when she barely knew him, it\u2019s wildly inappropriate and you have every right to feel the way you do. I think a lot of people think you\u2019re talking about a literal child and it\u2019s throwing them off, but she was an adult when they met and an adult when he died.\n\nI do think you should just block her from your account and your husbands, then if she posts about him at least you won\u2019t see it.\n\nEdit: and she\u2019s posting about him every few weeks even two years after his death? That\u2019s weird, like\u2026come on.", "YTA\nThis seems like a situation where your husband did an incredibly nice thing for someone who was going through a bad time, and these things had a lasting impression on her. You are the only one twisting into something it may or may not be. Why that is is something you need to reconcile.\n\nYou could have relieved yourself of this irritation at any time by blocking her, but for some reason you didn't. Again, that is for you to figure out why.\n\nPlease seek help for your grief.", "YTA. You say in one of the comments that he helped her get out of a bad living situation. She may not have had a huge impact on him, but he could have had a big impact on her. You don\u2019t get to tell other people how they should feel, and the amount of name calling here seems unnecessary. If it bothers you just block her so you don\u2019t have to see her posts.", "NAH. You're kinda the AH here but I'm guessing that it's your grief taking over so would suggest therapy instead. You should also just block her so you don't see the notifications and posts. Sounds like your husband was an incredibly kind man who made a difference in a child's life and I'm sorry for your loss. Please don't ruin the good deed your husband did and don't ruin his memory like that by contacting the kid who looks up to him.", "YTA. She can post whatever she wants. Plus there is probably more to the story as to why he is important to her. You\u2019re not entitled to know everything. Leave her be.", "YTA.\n\nYou focus a lot on \u201cyeah HE didn\u2019t give a shit\u201d but funnily you only mutely talk about how he helped her. It meant a lot. Leave her the fuck alone.", "NTA. Block and change your setting so you don't see it. Talking to her direct may start her doing something else.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but this seems unhealthy. Just block her and move on. You seem really obsessed with this, and clearly hold a lot of resentment towards this young woman who sounds like she\u2019s had a hard life. Block her, let it go, focus on your own healing.", "Yes, YWBTA because you could just block her on social media.", "YTA. You're policing who can and can't talk about your husband? So what if she wasn't that important to him he obviously was important to her and whatever he did to help her and her mother out of their situation meant a lot to her. So what if she's screwed up and he felt pity for her? Doesn't make the loss less on her side for whatever reason. Just block her account then if she tags him you won't see it.", "Sorry for the loss of your husband. YTA I\u2019m afraid. I suggest you stop following her on social media if her posts upset you. If you are now managing your deceased husband\u2019s social media accounts and you don\u2019t want to delete them (which I totally understand), then you can probably just block her so she can\u2019t tag him any more. Whatever is up with this child, it seems the thought of your husband comforts her. That\u2019s not a crime, and the best thing to do is ignore it, stop following, and block, so that you don\u2019t have to look at it if you find it upsetting.", "YTA- there are ways to not see these posts and also not dictate how another person grieves\n\nIf it\u2019s Instagram- block her or unfollow her \n\nFacebook- block or unfriend her. Or if you are worried about insulting her (which if you are willing to confront her -then I doubt you would be) - you can unfollow her. I\u2019ve done it a few times for people/family who annoy the shit of me with their posts but unfriending them would cause drama. Unfollowing allows you to still be \u201cfriends\u201d but their post never show up in your feed, unless you look them up.", "YTA.  For whatever reason this person idolized him.  Perhaps he was the only person to help her without any strings.  Who knows but the solution is easy and obvious.  Block her so you don\u2019t see the posts.  Problem solved.", "YTA\n\nJust block her so you don\u2019t see it.", "YTA\n\nHusband was your relationship to him.  You don't get to dictate what he meant to other people, their grief or their trauma. \n\nMute them, block them, unfriend them or just shut up.", "YTA and don\u2019t sound like a very nice person. Also I\u2019m concerned that a child was so close to your husband? Who is this child? How did your husband know her? Seems weird af.", "YTA\n\nSo your husband helped this young woman and her mom out, she's sad he's no longer in the world, and you want her to shut up about it?\n\nI know you're grieving, but the way you describe someone you think of as a child is incredibly mean. If her comments bother you, don't read them. But you shouldn't try to control how others express their grief.", "YTA. Just block her????", "YTA x1000. You're mad at this kid because she's sad that someone who helped her when she was down died?\n\nIf you're so tired of seeing her post about him then block her. But you have no right to police her like that.", "NTA, but a bad idea. You should go into your husband's social media accounts and block her from all of them, then she will not be able to tag him.", "YWBTA.\n\nI understand that you are grieving, but it sounds like she is too. She is also a child, and from the sounds of it she's a child who has experienced a lot of trauma. Rather than calling her degrading names and being so insensitive to this child (while also claiming she's the insensitive one)...how about you have some empathy for her? You are acting like she somehow poses a threat to you but I don't see how she would?\n\n> He pitied her because she was such a train wreck. I know that he didn't think of her at all when he died. \n\nYour husband somehow left a positive impact on this girl, and yet you almost seem like you are competing with her and wanting to prove to yourself (and us) that your husband thought very little of her or as lowly as you did. IMO, it's pretty disrespectful and dishonourable to his memory to claim that he just saw her as a \"train wreck\" to pity...are you sure you aren't just projecting that onto him to feel better? Hopefully he saw her as a kid who was struggling and that's why he agreed to help her out.\n\n> I want to ask a groupie to stop posting stuff about my late husband and would like to know if I would be the asshole if I do this. She makes his death all about her, and I believe it is incredibly insensitive.\n\nWow. Very insensitive and you seem to have so much contempt for a child who looks up to and appreciates your husband.", "Yta \n\u201cHe pitied her because she was such a train wreck.\u201d\n\nEw. Change your mindset", "I have no idea what you are saying. Maybe just ignore her? Maybe get counseling? You sound emotionally unstable.

Grief seems to have made you bitter and mean. Can you not understand that everyone grieves? Maybe your husband was a good influence in her life? Why can\u2019t you see thst? Is it because you feel insecure? A loving wife would say wasn\u2019t he fabulous and isn\u2019t it nice that she still cares for him? But as you\u2019re taking this the wrong way, if you can be polite you certainly could message her that you wish she would not post pics of him so often because it makes your grief worse. Or just ignore this. That would be best. YTA if you tell her in a mean way.", "YTA. Leave it alone.", "YTA. Grow up and stop trying to tell a child how to grieve.", "You say she's a child, but then that means she was a child two years ago when he died. You want to present her lack of presence at his death and funeral as evidence that she really wasn't that important to him? Wow. \n\nShe may very well be attention seeking with grief, but that's a part of actual grief too. And one could argue that you posting your rant about a girl who misses what was probably one of the only adult figures in her life who showed up for her when shit hit the fan sharing those feelings is doing the same thing: you're here to gain sympathy and solidarity from internet strangers. \n\nyes, YWBTA. do not reach out to her directly. Reach out to her parent figure now, if she has one whoever that is, and have them handle it. From the sound of it you would be rather rude to the poor thing, and the last thing she needs is to be reprimanded. If there is no one to reach out to, block her and forget about it. \n\nI'll tell you what I told my mother (and am STILL trying to tell her as we roll up on our two year anniversary) when my sister died: you do not get to gatekeep grief, and you do not get to dictate how others respond to this event.
