He\u2019s quite hard to deal with. I\u2019ve been told by people that we\u2019re not training him properly and he\u2019s gonna grow into a bad dog.\n\nThe main problem though, is he doesn\u2019t go to the toilet outside. I\u2019ve tried whatever I can think of but he just goes wherever he wants inside the house to pee & poop. We watch him carefully and try to prevent it as much as possible, we have training pads but he just ignores them. There\u2019s a lot more stuff but obviously there\u2019s a character limit\n\nRecently my boyfriend mentioned he\u2019s fed up of having to clean up dog mess all the time and fed up of the smell of it. He was also complaining about taking him on walks and other things. Luckily for him, he works Mon-Fri all day, so while he\u2019s working i look after him\n\nOne day, my bf was at work and I was still in bed sleeping. I always keep Kito in the room with me when sleeping, and I put a pad in the room incase he needs the toilet but like I said, he just ignores it. So he ends up peeing right next to the radiator which was on, and well it smelt really strong and had soaked into the floorboards.\n\nWhen I woke up, I said to myself I\u2019ll clean it later. Evening comes and my bf returns home, when he goes into the bedroom he gags and asks wtf that smell is, so I tell him. He was angry that I didn\u2019t even bother to get up and clean it, and that when I finally did get up I still didn\u2019t. He was really upset. He tried to clean it but it was soaked in so the smell was lingering and he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\n\nI said sorry, but reminded him I have depression and don\u2019t feel motivated to get up usually. I told my friend about it and she said \u201cit\u2019s kind of disgusting tbh\u201d. AITA?\n\nEdit : we don\u2019t have a crate for him because we think they look mean and cruel to put a dog in.\n\nEdit 2 : We already have an animal, a rabbit for 3 years. So we do have experience with animals a bit\n\nEdit 3 : A friend of mine mentioned puppy classes to my boyfriend but he claims he\u2019s been in one before and that they\u2019re a waste of time & money because they apparently just teach your dog basic tricks, like sit and stuff. Idk if he just doesn\u2019t want to pay for one or if he\u2019s being serious. Also, I don\u2019t really want to share too much personal info but I have other mental health issues apart from depression. I have gotten help before, but the mental health system seems to stop caring a lot once you turn 18. I\u2019ve been trying to get back to seeing someone.

It's not as stressful. it's far faster and very successful. You can't expect a puppy to know the rules, and the amount of freedom you've given such a young dog is causing huge damage to him as a pet.\n\nI hate to say this, but at 6 months, you already missed his easier training age range.

Neither of you seem up for it and the dog deserves better.", "YTA\n\nSeparate issues:\n\nYou can housebreak a dog. It takes consistency, patience, and given you\u2019re using tools and practices that aren\u2019t working for you, a lot of research. But there\u2019s no reason this puppy can\u2019t be house trained. Peeing inside is only going to get worse if you don\u2019t rededicate yourself to the project, as he\u2019s going to start marking (independent of just relieving himself) inside.\n\nA puppy is like a baby. They\u2019re on a very strict schedule when it comes to their little bodies and potty training. There is no \u201cleave a pad in the room\u201d with puppy and that\u2019s a solution if they haven\u2019t been housebroken. Maybe they will hit the pad. Hopefully, if you use the pads with technique to teach them to get to the door. But the point is to tie consumption of food/liquids to signaling and then relieving themselves outside. It requires attentiveness.\n\nI see that you\u2019re depressed. But that can\u2019t account for neglecting an animal in your care, or a space that you share with another human being. If you see/smell that the animal has soiled in the house and you can\u2019t clean it, I don\u2019t think you can be trusted with the care of said pet. \n\nYou need to treat your depression, and I hope you do. But in the meantime, if you are this pet\u2019s full time caregiver and you can\u2019t pick up its waste (or take it out on time\u2026), and your partner isn\u2019t able to do the whole thing alone, I think you need to look for a family (or a no-kill rescue, not a shelter; or the breeder you got the dog from) to rehome puppy. It\u2019s not fair for the dog.

YTA. You're so jucb the AH.  You are not mature enough to have a dog or responsible enough. Your friend is right. That's jastu AF. \nAlso, get a fuckiing crate. From a vet tech and dog trainer, crates are NOT mean and cruel, and you're just ignorant AF. And if you're too depressed to get yirh ass out if bed and walk your dog so he doesn't piss in the house, then don't get a dog. You and people lome you are the exact reason the shelters are over flowing with animals. And animals that are difficult to rehome because they have behavioral issues that become very difficult to rehome. \n1. Get a damn dog crate. You dog could be in thus crate when you're sleeping. When you're not home. When you are mot acutely involved and watching the dog. (At least until he is housebroken.) Most dogs actually prefer their crate as they are den animals and will continue to go into and sleep in the crates even when not locked in. When not vrated you need to limit hus access to the rest if the house so he can't sneak off and go potty. \n2. Housebreaking a dog needs patience and consistency. You need to set a timer and take him out every 20-30 minutes while housebreaking. Take Hon into and give gom 10 minutes to potty, and reward him heavily with treats and outside play time where you actually play with him immediately after he potties outside. If he doesn't potty, take him back on and set a timer for 15 minutes. Take him into again and do the same thing. Once he potties, you can set a timer for a bit longer. Keep track of how long he takes in between using the bathroom. Then, you can adjust the timer to anticipate when he will need to go to the bathroom again and won't have to sit the timer so frequently. (Thus method will be a pain in the ass in the beginning, but leads to very quick results--coupes to several weeks)\n3. Never ever punish the dog for an accident. If you feel the need to scold or pjnudh someone for him having am accident roll up some newspaper and beat yourself in the head because it's your fault for failing the dog and not getting him out in time. \n4. Look up bell training for dogs to teach him how to give a clear signal to you when he needs to go out.", "YTA- you've basically trained your dog that it's ok to pee in the house. First off you need to keep him leashed to you whenever you have him out and supervise him constantly. You take him out to pee every 1/2 hour and 10 min after he drinks water, 20 min after he eats. If you can't supervise him he need to be put into a crate. Under no circumstances are you to let this little monster be unsupervised until he is completely potty trained. Also there's a product called MyPetPeed that is a miracle at getting rid of urine stains and smells. Get a black light and go over your whole house and spray all of the glowing areas with the urine remover. When it dries you go back and see if it's still glowing and if so you spray it again.", "YTA for having a dog. \n\nCrates are not cruel and are an awesome training tool. My dog whined at first but grew to see it as her space. She now goes to sleep in it even when she could be on the couch with me.\n\nSecond you are not doing everything you can to train this dog. You should not have gotten a puppy, especially if this is your first dog. Potty training takes a lot. You can't just have a pee pad and expect them to use it.\n\nI don't do puppies because I need an ESA and the potty stuff is a lot, so I adopt adult dogs. But the times we had puppies when I was a kid we had the dog in a large crate with pee pads, or a room like the bathroom for a majority of the time, also with pads. But we would walk it and teach it going outside is good with treats and reinforcements. Then once it began to ask to go out we removed the pads and worked more, until we could trust it would ask to go out and not just go.\n\nPlease re home the dog. You don't know what you are doing, and the animal deserves better.\n\nEdit: you are using depression as an excuse. As someone with OCD and Anxiety I would never not take care of my dog just because it was a bad day. If anything having a dog keeps me doing needed things. But sounds like you aren't in that place.\n\nIf your depression is so bad it isn't under control enough to care for a pet, it isn't the time to have one. Especially not a puppy.", "Yta.

When you watch them you learn what they do before they go potty--sniffing, circling, dipping their little butt.

You need help, seek therapy, get a routine going; workout, take walks, eat decently. \n\nThe best thing would be to rehome the puppy. The puppy should not have to suffer because of your inaction and inability. \nRehome the puppy and then work on your mental health. And then maybe MAYBE in the future when you do your research, are prepared to put in the time and effort, and are in a healthy mental state then you can talk about getting a pet. But for now?

He is a puppy, a little puppy with a little bladder. You can't just sleep in, you need to be waking up early at the same time every day to walk dog, bleary eyed and all.

He\u2019s quite hard to deal with. I\u2019ve been told by people that we\u2019re not training him properly and he\u2019s gonna grow into a bad dog.\n\nThe main problem though, is he doesn\u2019t go to the toilet outside. I\u2019ve tried whatever I can think of but he just goes wherever he wants inside the house to pee & poop. We watch him carefully and try to prevent it as much as possible, we have training pads but he just ignores them. There\u2019s a lot more stuff but obviously there\u2019s a character limit\n\nRecently my boyfriend mentioned he\u2019s fed up of having to clean up dog mess all the time and fed up of the smell of it. He was also complaining about taking him on walks and other things. Luckily for him, he works Mon-Fri all day, so while he\u2019s working i look after him\n\nOne day, my bf was at work and I was still in bed sleeping. I always keep Kito in the room with me when sleeping, and I put a pad in the room incase he needs the toilet but like I said, he just ignores it. So he ends up peeing right next to the radiator which was on, and well it smelt really strong and had soaked into the floorboards.\n\nWhen I woke up, I said to myself I\u2019ll clean it later. Evening comes and my bf returns home, when he goes into the bedroom he gags and asks wtf that smell is, so I tell him. He was angry that I didn\u2019t even bother to get up and clean it, and that when I finally did get up I still didn\u2019t. He was really upset. He tried to clean it but it was soaked in so the smell was lingering and he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\n\nI said sorry, but reminded him I have depression and don\u2019t feel motivated to get up usually. I told my friend about it and she said \u201cit\u2019s kind of disgusting tbh\u201d. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At first you'll need to go out very frequently.  Again use rewards and praise for outdoor potty.   If you are consistent and stick with a regular schedule you and the dog will come to a point when you know exactly when the dog is going to go potty and there won't be any more surprises. This takes time and patience and dedication. It doesn't mean that 1 day you take the dog out at 8 AM for a pee break and then the next day you do it at 10 AM and expect the dog to hold it. I don't know about you but I have to pee when I wake up . Don't you think your dog does too?  They usually have to go right after eating as well. So make sure that you take them out right after breakfast and right after dinner.\n\nAnd then after all this if you can't find the dedication time and effort to put in to caring and training your dog then you need to rehome it because you're not ready to be a dog parent.", "Very gently, because I've been in a similar state of mental health, YTA.

Not shaming but you definitely need to reevaluate your training tactics.

I'm sure Ian does too, he's been at the head of the dog training community for a long time, but I usually watch his training videos and haven't read any of his books yet.\n\nA couple of quick notes:\n\n1- Crate training is not cruel and will be your best friend, especially for the potty training issue. While dogs are of course loved members of our family, people tend to humanize dogs and give them emotions and thoughts that sometimes just aren't possible for a dog. A crate will help you keep a schedule and help control/ prevent accidents. It's also a spot for your dog to go and relax on his own and will be a safe place for him when you're not able to keep your eyes on him. Which you can't be watching your dog 24/7. Especially a teething puppy who might end up chewing on electrical cords or getting into something hazardous. I would hate to see a tragedy happen because they were loose unsupervised. \n\n2- Are you trying to ultimately have them go potty outside? If that's your long-term goal then stop using the potty training pads inside. They're great to put at the bottom of a kennel or puppy playpen to make clean up a breeze, but ultimately for potty training purposes they just make things worse. It just confuses them and if you get to the point where they're successfully using the pad all the time, then you have to retrain from the pad to outside if that's your long-term goal. I know some people like to use it as a transition but I personally don't think it provides benefit. I would rather teach them using the right place (outside) all the time instead of a middle ground and then retraining. \n\n3- Any of the spots that the dog has had an accident inside you need to clean with a special enzyme cleaner because even using bleach will not get rid of the smell for the dog and will make them want to go there again.\n\nI wish you guys the best and am rooting for you and your furry family member!", "YTA", "YTA why would you want to live in filth.

At 6 months old it should be able to hold its bladder 6-8 hours, but your going to have to treat it like it\u2019s 2 months old until it\u2019s trained. Keep it on a leash in the house and attached to you. When it starts looking for a place to use the bathroom, immediately outside. Reward it when it pees outside. Immediately. Pee finishes, treats in the mouth. Immediately. No treats in the house. No treats just because. Use the treats. Make it learn how to get them. Pee outside. Sit like a good boy. Stuff like that. \n\nDogs are den animals by nature. Get an appropriate sized crate for the dog when it\u2019s full grown. They\u2019ll usually come with a divider for when the dog is small. Only give it as much room as it needs. Put a plastic tote or something it can\u2019t destroy in the crate to fill up the extra space until it needs the space. It only needs space to stand up, turn around and lay down. If that\u2019s all the space it has, it won\u2019t pee in there cuz it doesn\u2019t want to lay in its own pee. Also no blankets or beds or soft anything until it\u2019s trained. Anything that will absorb the pee just encourages it to pee. \n\nAgain, den animals by nature\u2026 get a cover for the crate. Give a treat when he goes in the crate. Cover it. Ignore it if it whines or leave the room. It doesn\u2019t need let out, it\u2019s not torture. Just like letting an actual baby cry, it doesn\u2019t hurt the dog, it\u2019s not bad bad for the dog. It\u2019s not cruel.  \n\nConsistency is absolutely a must. \n\nIt\u2019s what a 30ish lb dog full size? Get a laser pointer. My boxer loses his mind for the mouse shape for 30-45 minutes and then he needs a nap. \n\nStop being an asshole. Train your dog or rehome it.", "YTA Those floors are going to be ruined.

And a note on kennels- I was also skeptical about them and was reluctant to get one for my dog (2 year old lab/rottie mutt, we've had for about a year). We were having urination issues with him because he'd get stressed out when left alone and overly excited when we came home. He'd pee, then realize he was peeing inside where he wasn't supposed to, so he'd get scared and pee more. We had been advised to kennel train him, but we were worried it would be too similar to his cage in the shelter and he'd be stressed. Well we tried everything else with no success, so eventually it was last resort time. We brought home a kennel, set it up, and he ran right in there like \"finally! you figured out what i wanted!\" Now he'll hang out there voluntarily, and when we leave the house and ask him to kennel up he'll SPRINT over and settle himself in there. Honestly, my only regret is taking so long to realize what he needed and get him one. \n\nObviously every dog is different, and our experience is not universal.

If you can't get up and won't properly train him and crate train him, you aren't worthy. \nAnd to correct you dogs love their crates. Get them an appropriate sized one and it is never used is punishment. This will become their den and their space if done correctly but it is clear you aren't capable.\n\nAlso what if you want to go on vacation or need someone to watch your dog? Who would want this dog in their home?", "Crates are not inhumane. YTA and nasty.", "Oh, that is gross. Your house must smell awful. Train your dog or find him a home with someone will take proper care of him.

And the dog deserves a better life.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou don't leave urine to soak. Part of being a dog owner is dealing with their messes, even when it's in the middle of the night. Even when you're in a depressive episode. It's not just gross to leave it, but once it soaks in guess what? The dog can smell it there, and will continue to use that spot (that's why urine cleaners have enzymes in them and are different from regular cleaners).   \nI also deal with depression. I am single and have two dogs and a cat. I get how impossibly hard it can be to just get out of bed. But, you have a life depending on you! Even in my darkest moments I still had to get out of bed to feed, take outside, and just generally care for my pets. Yes, pottying in the house isn't going to kill your dog, but it's not fair to you, him, or your boyfriend. If depression is that much of an issue that you can't care for the dog, then the best thing (for all of you) to do is rehome him.   \n\n\nSecond, get over what you \"think\" crates look like and crate train your dog. Potty training is hard, and you have a breed notoriously hard to potty train (pomeranian) mixed with a stubborn, smart breed (husky). You and your boyfriend have not set your puppy up for success. Crate training is helpful because a crate acts as a \"den\" and safe space for your dog, plus dogs don't generally want to potty where they sleep.\n\n  \nPlease look up actual training resources on both crate training and potty training. You've tried \"whatever you can think of,\" which is what exactly? Watching him? Putting down potty pads you haven't trained him to use? You start by taking him outside every 30 mins-hour, and also immediately when he wakes up (when HE wakes up, not you), after he eats or plays, or literally anytime he's sniffing around the floor. Crate (or even a pen) training means he's not just wandering the house when you aren't paying attention; it also means you can have pee pads down in a small area where he can't just avoid them. Crate training also helps create a schedule so you can figure out when he might need to go to the bathroom. At 6 months a puppy should be able to hold it for up to 6 hours, but at least for a few at a time; the problem is that you have not taught your dog how to hold it and go outside.  \n\n\nI don't blame your boyfriend for being upset at having to clean and smell that all the time, but it's also his responsibility. So really, everyone sucks here. Except the dog, who is a baby and literally does not know any better.", "I have a Pomsky and used pads for the first few months because she was unpredictable even though I took her out very often. \n\nHere\u2019s what you should have done: between months 2-4, when she pees, you pick her up and place her on the pad. Before she does if you can but Mid-pee if you have to. Then reward her for peeing on the pad. Every time you go outside, bring a pad and if she pees, reward!! (Treat). \n\nFrom months 4-7ish, remove the indoor pad and continue the cycle with outside (bring her out if she looks like she needs to pee and reward her when she pees outside). Eventually she will stand by the door because she will want to pee outside since she was rewarded for it. \n\nRemember a Pomsky puppy needs to pee often. Especially depending on what T they are (if they are further bread tiers, they are smaller and therefore have smaller bladders). \n\nAlso, a dog cage is their safe space, not a punishment. Don\u2019t put them in there as a punishment but rather when going to bed or leaving them alone at home. \n\nAll things considered, YTA. You shouldn\u2019t ever leave pee or poo anywhere inside long term and depression is not a reason to neglect your dog. \n\nI will say your bf is an AH too for bringing in/agreeing to a dog into a home that obviously can\u2019t handle it.

A 2 month old puppy can only hold their bladder for about 2 hours. This is important information for housetraining. I got my dog at 2 months as well so I would put a 2 hour timer on my phone and when it went off, I\u2019d take him out and walk him around and when he did his business I would praise him excitedly. And sometimes give him a treat. If he had an accident because I lost track of time I wouldn\u2019t scold him because it was on me. I would clean it up immediately and take him for a walk. When he peed again outside, I would praise him. He quickly figured out the rules. I think most dogs would because they want to be good and love to be praised. Housetraining is not that difficult and if your dog is still having accidents at 6 months it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t trained them properly and you haven\u2019t made that boundary clear. \n\n2. Crates are not cruel and I think that when you properly crate train a dog they start to see the crate as their safe little den and will willingly go in there when they want space or want to relax. \n\n3. If your mental health is preventing you from caring for your dog, you shouldn\u2019t have a dog. Not getting out of bed to take your dog out to do their business is cruel and setting them up for failure. How long can you hold your bladder?

That means that a puppy will consider a crate his/her sleeping area and place of safety. Have him in the crate when he sleeps or when you want him to be non-active (surprisingly minimum of 18hrs a day). Dogs are less likely to pee when they are in their \"den\". You can make it more denish by adding a blanket and a doggy bed if you wish. DON'T USE CRATE AS A PUNISHMENT.\n\n2. Depression is not a good reason to not take care of something you are responsible for. If you are so depressed that you can't clean up after the dog then you shouldn't have a dog. I do hope your depression gets better but a puppy is not the answer. They are too much work. \n\n3. As soon as you take puppy out of crate, take it outside. Praise puppy as soon as he pees/poops outside. Use high value treats (chicken is a good one)\n\n4. Start training the puppy on other things. IE sit, lie down, leave it, and come. \n\n5.

Many dogs don\u2019t know the difference between the potty pad (because how do they know what it is) or a blanket on the floor or dirty laundry on the floor. Stop using potty pads. They are just gross. \n\nStep 1 for potty training. The dog is never given the opportunity to potty in the house. This means if your eyes are not directly on the dog that they are in the dog crate. If you are doing things around the house like cleaning, put the dogs leash on and attach it to your waist. Dog stays with you all the time so you can keep an eye on it. Set a timer (literally do it) for every 2 hours to take the dog outside to potty.  Also, first thing in the morning take it out to potty and I don\u2019t mean after you have gotten dressed and stuff, I mean immediately because it has no bladder control yet and will go inside. If the pup is laying down having a nap then wakes up, take it outside. If the dog just had it\u2019s mean, take it outside. Basically you are constantly taking the puppy outside to potty. That is the job you two signed up for when you decided to get a puppy. Right now that is your only job until it learns to potty outside. \n\nOther tips - do not free feed your dog. Give it two scheduled meals a day, morning and evening. Give it treats and lots of praise for going potty outside. Take the dog for walks as that actually stimulates their bladder to go. It\u2019s cold and rainy outside now so potty training will be harder and the longer you wait to start these things the harder it will be. Oh yeah, puppy sleeps in a crate at night. And always clean up when it has an accident. \n\nYou are young and stupid for getting a dog if you aren\u2019t able or willing to give it 100% commitment.

For her sake, and for the sake of the dog, she needs to rehome it. \n\nIt's sad that people here are bashing her for having a mental illness.

Anxiety is its own can of worms and is very difficult to cope with. I only mean to point out that most anxiety disorders don't generally include symptoms such as lethargy, low motivation, and executive dysfunction, all of which directly effect one's ability to do things like care for an animal. \n\nThat's also not to say that people suffering from those things *can't* care for an animal; only that they have to do some genuine introspection about how much those symptoms will realistically effect their ability to be a responsible and reliable pet owner. In my case, having a pet does actually help my depression-related symptoms, because it forces me out of bed every morning. The same is not true of everyone, however, and while generally speaking that is perfectly fine, when it comes to pet ownership it's an even bigger problem. \n\nI had an ex whose depressive episodes were so bad that he was literally unable to get up from the couch/bed to do anything other than use the bathroom. He also had a cat that he would consistently not feed, water, or scoop the litterbox for due to his level of exhaustion and lethargy. If you reminded him about it he'd say, \"I already fed the cat today\", but it would be 9 AM and the cat's bowl would be completely empty, because he *hadn't* actually fed the cat (who ate fast, but not nearly fast enough to empty the entire bowl of dry food before noon).

Any time anything seemed slightly odd about the dog I would literally fall to the floor sobbing because I was convinced she was going to die and it was my fault. I was constantly scared I was leaving her in the crate too long or not long enough or feeding her too much or too little or walking her too far or not often enough and those things are actually paralysing. I felt like I couldn\u2019t make any decision because it might be the wrong decision. I was lucky and my family and trainers were happy for me to call them for help.

Both in terms of your own mental health and your ability to be a good owner for your dog. It sounds like you pushed yourself to complete what for you were legitimately Herculean tasks because you knew that was what you needed to do for your dog's sake. And it seems like now that the initial anxiety of having a new pet has... not gone away, but perhaps become a bit numbed, you have been able to find ways of coping with those difficulties that are mutually beneficial. You didn't just throw up your hands and say, \"Well, I have anxiety, there's nothing I can do\" and allow your dug to suffer the consequences as a result. \n\nThat's the kind of difference I'm trying to get at.

When I saw \"pomsky\" I cringed. \"Being cute\" is not worth the neurosis that comes with mixing breeds like this. Surprisingly enough, both were bred for pulling sleds. Pomeranians were also bred for the same winter working-dog tasks as huskies. The major difference is their size and how it effects their work ethic and personalities.\n\nI lived with someone who owned beagle/bassett hound mixes (bagel hound). Those dogs always seemed unexplainably frustrated.

If I was doing chores around the house, she'd follow me meowing *for hours* to demand I sit and pet her.\n\nI miss having a cat, but I sadly can't just go to the humane society after developing severe breathing problems. Among said breathing problems: an allergy to *some* cats. I landed in the hospital from a short haired male, but I was fine with my long haired female. I have to get a Siberian cat since they're great if you're allergic, but I've never bought from a breeder. I'm trying to figure it out.\n\nSorry for rambling a bit, I just haven't really been able to write anything out about my cat. It helped, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to reminisce.", "I have a Pom as well and what a pain in the ass to train them:( this is my second one so I already knew, but they really are notorious for being hard to housebreak. I have my little girl on a schedule now so she\u2019s ok, but if I lose track of time it\u2019s a big nope. I do crate her at night so that makes life easier for both of us.", "Pretty similar situation here tbh. Clinically depressed, desperately wanted a pet, but wasn't sure I'd actually be able to take care of one when I can't even consistently take care of myself. I spent *months* self-analyzing before coming to the conclusion that I could be a good cat owner. Because even if I couldn't drag myself out of bed to do anything else, I felt damn sure that I could do it to take care of my cat. And if I ended up being wrong despite all that honest introspection, I would find that cat a different home where I could be sure it would be taken care of, no matter how much it broke my heart. Because it doesn't actually matter how much you *want* a thing if that thing is a living, breathing creature that you are not capable of adequately caring for. I also intentionally sought out an older cat with a more mellow temperament, because I knew both my own temperament and current living accommodations weren't compatible with a young, energetic cat that needed constant stimulation. \n\nIn the end, I did end up getting a sweet orange 9-year-old fuzzhead, and you know what? Sometimes I still sleep obscenely late because of my depression, or go to sleep at 7 AM and wake up at 6 PM. But that cat gets fed every morning and night, twice a day, without fail. He never goes longer than 12 hours between meals and always has fresh water. His box gets scooped first thing every day. When he pukes or poops outside his box (because he's 13 years old now and gets constipated) I sigh and I clean it up. When he's not eating or peeing or pooping consistently I take him to the vet, because I pay attention when I scoop his box. He's never been more than a few weeks overdue for his yearly check-ups or vaccines. Because he's my little guy, and he's 110% dependent on *me* to take care of him and make sure he is as healthy as possible. Even when I'm in the middle of a severe depressive episode... or dissociated... or having a total mental breakdown. Even when I can barely keep myself alive, that cat gets his breakfast, dinner, fresh water, and clean litterbox. Every. Single. Day.", "YES, EXACTLY!\n\nI also have depression. When I got my first apartment, I wanted a cat so badly it hurt. But I spent literal *months* introspecting in an attempt to figure out if being responsible for an animal was something I was actually capable of, because I didn't want to get a cat just to realize, \"Hey actually I'm not up for this, sorry cat, sucks to suck\". \n\nIn the end I decided that I being a good cat owner *was* something I could do, and *would* be beneficial to me because it would give me a reason to get out of bed. Sometimes I would get out of bed, feed the cat, scoop the box, refresh the water bowl, and then go right back to bed. There were many days when I couldn't be bothered to feed myself, and I'd go months without cleaning my own stuff, but you can be DAMN well sure that I fed that cat twice a day every day and that that litterbox was scooped at least once daily. Because you know what? That dumb little fur baby has no concept of what depression is. He wouldn't know that I'm not getting out of bed to give him his breakfast because I'm having a mental breakdown. He would just know that he's hungry and his food bowl is empty. \n\nI also got an older cat because I *knew* that both my own mindset and my lifestyle weren't compatible with a kitten or an adolescent cat. I specifically asked the shelter for adoptable cats that were older and more mellow. If they hadn't had any candidates that didn't fit that bill, I wouldn't have gotten a cat that day. Because raising a baby animal is HARD WORK. And if you can't put in that hard work despite your own troubles, you don't deserve to have one.", "She\u2019s a papillon Pomeranian mix!", "\u201c we don\u2019t have a crate cuz we think they look mean\u201d\n\njumping on top comment to say that you\u2019re childishly minded and neither of you are capable of being good dog owners, especially to a Pomsky", "I've been thinking of getting a Shiba, but I also have cats and heard shibas aren't great with other pets.

I *love* huskies, they're so gorgeous - but I've decided not to get one, because I know I wouldn't be able to care for it properly. They are *such* difficult dogs. So if I want a husky real bad, I get a digital version in the Sims or Nintendogs. Problem solved.", "We\u2019re 99% sure my husky\u2019s mom was a German shepherd.

And she can be a menace when she\u2019s not happy.", "Never. It is his ancestral duty to terrorize postmen. :)", "Depends on a lot of things. My Shiba chased cats, but never hurt them. And when I got my Bengal she shut the chasing down hard! I wouldn't trust him around anything too much smaller than he was though. But he was raised around cats, so he was fine with them. \n\nThose dogs were bred to hunt boar and have a high prey drive. I would 'loan' my guy to my parents and he'd spend an afternoon killing every single mole in their backyard. Once he caught and killed a rabbit almost as big as he was! He loved visiting his 'pack' of 3 retrievers at my parent's place. He did keep trying to chase the horse down though. \n\nAll dogs develop their own personalities and quirks. I had to keep up with Taiki's socialization all the time, or he would start acting up around other animals. He loved people though, which was slightly odd for a Shiba. \n\nThe thing to remember most about Shibas is that they are smart and stubborn drama queens mostly. They **need** to be stimulated and given new challenges all the time. Just exercising them isn't enough. Because a bored Shiba is a destructive Shiba. My guy loved clicker training and we were always working on new tricks.\n\nI had taught him to sneeze on command. He loved using his new tricks to get rewards. One weekend my dad says there's something wrong with my dog. He keeps staring at my dad and sneezing. I look over and my dad had a sandwich in his hand. Taiki was showing off his new trick hoping my dad would share!\n\nDo as much research about the breed as you can. A puppy raised with cats will probably be fine with them. Just be ready because they can be a lot of work!\n\n[Dog tax](https://imgur.com/a/BfUxdPJ)", "He's such a cliche", "Oh my gosh, what a cutie! Will definitely have to do my research, I need a lazy dog to match my laziness lol.

I know how it feels when you WANT to do what you know needs to be done and what you theoretically want to be done. You Want to be capable of it. It\u2019s not your fault for being depressed and out of control of yourself. This is all sad tbh. Your dog needs a home where he\u2019s taken care of.

Here in Sweden it\u2019s a very serious offense to lock a door in a crate when it\u2019s not being actively transported or at exhibitions/events. Arguably this country has the most responsible dog owners (there are zero strays here) and none of us crate our dogs.", "Oh absolutely!
