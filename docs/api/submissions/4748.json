He\u2019s quite hard to deal with. I\u2019ve been told by people that we\u2019re not training him properly and he\u2019s gonna grow into a bad dog.\n\nThe main problem though, is he doesn\u2019t go to the toilet outside. I\u2019ve tried whatever I can think of but he just goes wherever he wants inside the house to pee & poop. We watch him carefully and try to prevent it as much as possible, we have training pads but he just ignores them. There\u2019s a lot more stuff but obviously there\u2019s a character limit\n\nRecently my boyfriend mentioned he\u2019s fed up of having to clean up dog mess all the time and fed up of the smell of it. He was also complaining about taking him on walks and other things. Luckily for him, he works Mon-Fri all day, so while he\u2019s working i look after him\n\nOne day, my bf was at work and I was still in bed sleeping. I always keep Kito in the room with me when sleeping, and I put a pad in the room incase he needs the toilet but like I said, he just ignores it. So he ends up peeing right next to the radiator which was on, and well it smelt really strong and had soaked into the floorboards.\n\nWhen I woke up, I said to myself I\u2019ll clean it later. Evening comes and my bf returns home, when he goes into the bedroom he gags and asks wtf that smell is, so I tell him. He was angry that I didn\u2019t even bother to get up and clean it, and that when I finally did get up I still didn\u2019t. He was really upset. He tried to clean it but it was soaked in so the smell was lingering and he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\n\nI said sorry, but reminded him I have depression and don\u2019t feel motivated to get up usually. I told my friend about it and she said \u201cit\u2019s kind of disgusting tbh\u201d. AITA?\n\nEdit : we don\u2019t have a crate for him because we think they look mean and cruel to put a dog in.", "created_utc": 1671061418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm6216/aita_for_not_cleaning_up_our_dogs_pee_quick_enough/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It takes consistency, patience, and given you\u2019re using tools and practices that aren\u2019t working for you, a lot of research. But there\u2019s no reason this puppy can\u2019t be house trained. Peeing inside is only going to get worse if you don\u2019t rededicate yourself to the project, as he\u2019s going to start marking (independent of just relieving himself) inside.\n\nA puppy is like a baby. They\u2019re on a very strict schedule when it comes to their little bodies and potty training. There is no \u201cleave a pad in the room\u201d with puppy and that\u2019s a solution if they haven\u2019t been housebroken. Maybe they will hit the pad. Hopefully, if you use the pads with technique to teach them to get to the door. But the point is to tie consumption of food/liquids to signaling and then relieving themselves outside. It requires attentiveness.\n\nI see that you\u2019re depressed. But that can\u2019t account for neglecting an animal in your care, or a space that you share with another human being. If you see/smell that the animal has soiled in the house and you can\u2019t clean it, I don\u2019t think you can be trusted with the care of said pet. \n\nYou need to treat your depression, and I hope you do. But in the meantime, if you are this pet\u2019s full time caregiver and you can\u2019t pick up its waste (or take it out on time\u2026), and your partner isn\u2019t able to do the whole thing alone, I think you need to look for a family (or a no-kill rescue, not a shelter; or the breeder you got the dog from) to rehome puppy.

YTA. You're so jucb the AH.  You are not mature enough to have a dog or responsible enough. Your friend is right. That's jastu AF. \nAlso, get a fuckiing crate. From a vet tech and dog trainer, crates are NOT mean and cruel, and you're just ignorant AF. And if you're too depressed to get yirh ass out if bed and walk your dog so he doesn't piss in the house, then don't get a dog. You and people lome you are the exact reason the shelters are over flowing with animals. And animals that are difficult to rehome because they have behavioral issues that become very difficult to rehome. \n1. Get a damn dog crate. You dog could be in thus crate when you're sleeping. When you're not home. When you are mot acutely involved and watching the dog. (At least until he is housebroken.) Most dogs actually prefer their crate as they are den animals and will continue to go into and sleep in the crates even when not locked in. When not vrated you need to limit hus access to the rest if the house so he can't sneak off and go potty. \n2. Housebreaking a dog needs patience and consistency. You need to set a timer and take him out every 20-30 minutes while housebreaking. Take Hon into and give gom 10 minutes to potty, and reward him heavily with treats and outside play time where you actually play with him immediately after he potties outside. If he doesn't potty, take him back on and set a timer for 15 minutes. Take him into again and do the same thing. Once he potties, you can set a timer for a bit longer. Keep track of how long he takes in between using the bathroom. Then, you can adjust the timer to anticipate when he will need to go to the bathroom again and won't have to sit the timer so frequently. (Thus method will be a pain in the ass in the beginning, but leads to very quick results--coupes to several weeks)\n3. Never ever punish the dog for an accident. If you feel the need to scold or pjnudh someone for him having am accident roll up some newspaper and beat yourself in the head because it's your fault for failing the dog and not getting him out in time. \n4. Look up bell training for dogs to teach him how to give a clear signal to you when he needs to go out.", "YTA- you've basically trained your dog that it's ok to pee in the house. First off you need to keep him leashed to you whenever you have him out and supervise him constantly. You take him out to pee every 1/2 hour and 10 min after he drinks water, 20 min after he eats. If you can't supervise him he need to be put into a crate. Under no circumstances are you to let this little monster be unsupervised until he is completely potty trained. Also there's a product called MyPetPeed that is a miracle at getting rid of urine stains and smells. Get a black light and go over your whole house and spray all of the glowing areas with the urine remover. When it dries you go back and see if it's still glowing and if so you spray it again.", "YTA for having a dog. \n\nCrates are not cruel and are an awesome training tool. My dog whined at first but grew to see it as her space. She now goes to sleep in it even when she could be on the couch with me.\n\nSecond you are not doing everything you can to train this dog. You should not have gotten a puppy, especially if this is your first dog. Potty training takes a lot. You can't just have a pee pad and expect them to use it.\n\nI don't do puppies because I need an ESA and the potty stuff is a lot, so I adopt adult dogs. But the times we had puppies when I was a kid we had the dog in a large crate with pee pads, or a room like the bathroom for a majority of the time, also with pads. But we would walk it and teach it going outside is good with treats and reinforcements. Then once it began to ask to go out we removed the pads and worked more, until we could trust it would ask to go out and not just go.\n\nPlease re home the dog. You don't know what you are doing, and the animal deserves better.\n\nEdit: you are using depression as an excuse. As someone with OCD and Anxiety I would never not take care of my dog just because it was a bad day. If anything having a dog keeps me doing needed things.

He\u2019s quite hard to deal with. I\u2019ve been told by people that we\u2019re not training him properly and he\u2019s gonna grow into a bad dog.\n\nThe main problem though, is he doesn\u2019t go to the toilet outside. I\u2019ve tried whatever I can think of but he just goes wherever he wants inside the house to pee & poop. We watch him carefully and try to prevent it as much as possible, we have training pads but he just ignores them. There\u2019s a lot more stuff but obviously there\u2019s a character limit\n\nRecently my boyfriend mentioned he\u2019s fed up of having to clean up dog mess all the time and fed up of the smell of it. He was also complaining about taking him on walks and other things. Luckily for him, he works Mon-Fri all day, so while he\u2019s working i look after him\n\nOne day, my bf was at work and I was still in bed sleeping. I always keep Kito in the room with me when sleeping, and I put a pad in the room incase he needs the toilet but like I said, he just ignores it. So he ends up peeing right next to the radiator which was on, and well it smelt really strong and had soaked into the floorboards.\n\nWhen I woke up, I said to myself I\u2019ll clean it later. Evening comes and my bf returns home, when he goes into the bedroom he gags and asks wtf that smell is, so I tell him. He was angry that I didn\u2019t even bother to get up and clean it, and that when I finally did get up I still didn\u2019t. He was really upset. He tried to clean it but it was soaked in so the smell was lingering and he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\n\nI said sorry, but reminded him I have depression and don\u2019t feel motivated to get up usually. I told my friend about it and she said \u201cit\u2019s kind of disgusting tbh\u201d. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Feed the dog breakfast then immediately bring the dog to the pad.  Always have the pad in the same spot.   Sometimes you'll start to see signs they're ready (circling the area maybe).

If you are consistent and stick with a regular schedule you and the dog will come to a point when you know exactly when the dog is going to go potty and there won't be any more surprises.

I don't know about you but I have to pee when I wake up . Don't you think your dog does too?  They usually have to go right after eating as well. So make sure that you take them out right after breakfast and right after dinner.\n\nAnd then after all this if you can't find the dedication time and effort to put in to caring and training your dog then you need to rehome it because you're not ready to be a dog parent.", "Very gently, because I've been in a similar state of mental health, YTA.

And never ever let pup's pee or poop sit on real wood, get some enzyme treatment from the pet store and hope you didn't just let puppy's accident ruin your floor.", "YTA- Leaving dog piss to sit for hours is nasty and as you said, it soaked in the floorboards which means it may not come out which means a lingering smell.\n\nEither crate train the puppy or rehome until you can properly care for/train a puppy  \n\nA crate is not mean or cruel, it's actually a safe space for them, it also protects your house from being destroyed.", "Omg.
