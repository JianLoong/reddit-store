{"id": 29979, "submission_id": "17jx8pr", "title": "AITA for leaving my own \"baby shower\"?", "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (36F) are finally expecting a child together after years of trying, and we're both super excited. Due to how long it's taken to get pregnant, I'm being careful over who I'm telling and how I'm celebrating, especially given the risk of miscarriage. I'm seven months along.\n\n  \nMy husband is close to his two female first cousins N (40F) and A (45F), both of whom have kids. My husband and I both immigrated to our current country from different countries and met here as adults. In my culture, we don't have baby showers prior to birth due to caution about not celebrating too much before giving birth to a live baby, while in my husband's culture, baby showers are common. Both N and A had baby showers, which is fine (I attended and gave them gifts), but now that I'm pregnant, they're asking me when my baby shower is going to be. I've told them repeatedly that I'm not going to have one. They're refused to acknowledge this and have continued to ask. My MIL and my husband's aunt are also asking but have been more polite when I've explained why I don't want one. The cousins are disappointed that we're not having a baby shower, since they're close to my husband.\n\n  \nThis weekend, N invited me for a family dinner at her house, and it turned out to be a surprise baby shower for us: decorations, games, gifts, the whole shebang. My family live a few states away, so it was just my husband's family and friends in attendance. I flipped out. I had told them repeatedly that I don't want a baby shower because I'm being superstitious about finally having a healthy baby; I burst into tears and told them that if they weren't going to listen to me, then they weren't going to meet my baby after the birth. My MIL had driven me there, so I ordered an \u00fcber and went home without telling them. Apparently they called my husband in a panic because I had just left, and my husband got upset at me for leaving when his family was just trying to do a nice thing for me. I said that doing a nice thing would've been to respect my wishes. When I complained to my mother, she was surprised and said that she hadn't heard anything about this until now, so apparently nobody on my side was even consulted.\n\n  \nMy husband and his family are upset at me for not being grateful about the baby shower, and my husband said that I should've just sat through it. I say that I shouldn't have to tolerate something that goes against my cultural practices when it doesn't hurt anyone. My husband and I can afford to buy stuff for our baby, so it's not about the gifts. (And yes, I know how expensive things can get for babies; it's more that I don't want unnecessary/unwanted stuff cluttering our home.). My husband wants to keep the gifts because his family went to the trouble of buying them, whereas I want to donate them.

You made it clear you did not want one and you explained yourself, which you didn't have to do. Just because they are excited and wanted to celebrate doesn't mean that they had to do this. They could have easily waited until your baby was born to celebrate (that is if you wanted to. having a newborn around people is a lot on so many levels). Honestly, your husband needs to understand that you and your baby are now his immediate family and his immediate priority. If he cannot accept that and support you now, I'm sorry, but that means this is only going to get worse. If your husband cannot support you, then you need to do what is best for you and your baby.", "NTA. The fact that they went ahead and had the shower despite you saying \u201cno\u201dmeans that it wasn\u2019t about you at all - it means that having the shower was for them and them alone. And they are angry because you didn\u2019t give them the effusive praise that they felt they deserved for giving you something you never wanted in the first place. \n\nKeep this in mind: your in laws will not respect you or any boundaries you set if it is the way of something they want.", "NTA. You repeatedly told them you didn't want a baby shower and why, and then they tricked you into attending one. To me, this isn't an honest mistake but a bunch of choices these people made to ignore your wishes and now they're pretending to be victims when they should've just listened to you.\n\nIt wasn't a nice thing for you- it was a baby shower for themselves. They didn't even include your family and friends. You have a husband problem, for not having your back. I dunno if there are going to be other cultural differences in the future, but you should figure those out with him.", "NTA. If someone repeatedly says no to something, others should respect that and honor their wishes.\n\nIt's your baby (congrats) and yet they made it about them. I would've left too.", "NTA.  I would've left too.  Your cultural practices around baby showers don't hurt anyone, and it sounds like you're not in it for the gifts (and that you've accepted how expensive babies are).  I'd give your husband's family a very wide berth.", "NTA. They repeatedly ignored your wishes and lied to you to get you to come, because they knew they were in the wrong. They assumed you would sit there and take it due to social pressure. Good for you for leaving but I'm sorry it upset you so much. All your responses are exactly on point too. \n\nYour husband is also a major AH. He knows you didn't want this and knows why. It's a betrayal that he allowed you to be tricked into this and that he cares more about what his meddling, unempathetic family wants rather than his own wife. This would be a reckoning for me because your marriage is in peril. I'm assuming there's couple's counseling where you are? Or take some time to visit your family and get some space from all of them - that's what I would do.", "\"We're upset that you aren't grateful that we did the thing for you that you told us you didn't want us to do.\" \n\nNTA.", "Nta husband most likely was in on the shower. Respect of cultural differences  and boundaries  with your husband  and his family  are the real issue. It's telling they did not include your family & stomped all over your beliefs and boundaries.  Stand your ground.", "NTA.  If the subject of the party doesn't want the party, THE PARTY DOESN'T HAPPEN.  This should not be difficult to understand.\n\nI'm sorry that his family is a pack of boundary-stomping AHs and yeah, they need to be in a time out for a while.", "NTA, and your husband\u2019s family is giving off racist vibes for repeatedly ignoring the fact that your culture does not do baby showers before birth. This shower was only for them and they did not consider you at all. Your husband needs to manage his family better and be more supportive of you. He owes you and apology and his family owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nThat's unbelievably rude of them.", "Nta.\n\n\nI would ask hubby.\n\nWhy are you OK with this? It doesn't matter what it is. If I set a boundary and they stomp all over it, how is that ok? Why are you placing their WANTS over my NEEDS? What else are you willing to back them on when it comes to me? So should I just now roll over on every demand your family makes? How they even exclude my family? So what are they going to be raising my child? Because you are backing what they want, and I am expected to just accept that. Why in the hell do you think I will stay with someone who cares more about what his family wants and shows me I mean nothing to him? Either you back me on boundaries that are important to me, or you show how little you care about me. This is non-negotiable. Cultures are different, but mine are just as important and as the person YOU CHOOSE to marry. As the person you promised in vows  to FORSAKE all others, it's time you start being the husband you promised because I refuse to allow you or your family to make me feel I am nothing. That my needs are not important\n I refuse to allow anyone to take over and run my life or my child's life because they are family.\n\nNot only are you NTA but now is that time to find out what else he is going to turn on you for his family and if it's something you need to go stay with your family because so far he is showing they are more important and you mean nothing. Harsh, but it's time to be mama bear before baby is here or his family will run your kids life and you will have no say. They have proven they are willing to do it already.", "NTA. It's upsetting that your husband isn't respecting your decision. It's ok to not want a shower.\n\nI didn't want a baby shower & I come from a culture where EVERYONE has baby showers. I told my husband & he said, \"Whatever you want or don't want is fine with me.\" A few people tried to slide a shower past me. I shut them down. & when I knew an upcoming dinner was really a shower, I didn't go.\n\nIf anyone had tried an ambush shower on me, I would have left, too. \n\nI'm sorry your husband is being a doormat to his family & prioritizing them over you.", "NTA who do they think they are to make things about them", "NTA. You repeatedly said you didn\u2019t want one and they didn\u2019t listen. Anything that happened as a result of that is on them.", "NTA - you were very clear that you did not want a baby shower.", "NTA. From an American, where baby showers are the norm: even in our culture, if someone tells you 'no, I don't want one' *you don't throw one*.\n\nYou left in literal tears. Anyone whose 'nice gesture' backfires that badly is an AH. *Especially* when boundaries have been explained repeatedly, so a negative reaction is to be expected.\n\nThere were many compromises to be made here. Yes, there's something to honor each parent's culture. But the shower could have just as easily happened after the birth as before. It's much more common across the world to give gifts after the birth than before. (Just don't pass the baby around. People can coo over the bassinet/pack n play.)", "Nta at all! They didn\u2019t respect you. You didn\u2019t need to stay just to be further disrespected. I\u2019d be very pissed at all of them but especially my husband omg. He\u2019s the one person that is supposed to be backing you and the baby no matter what. Him choosing the family would have made me livid.", "NTA - Your group should respect such a simple wish", "NTA, regardless of culture. If you don't want a baby shower, regardless of the reasons, no one can throw you one, end of the matter. It doesn't need to be a cultural reason, it could be just because you don't like it.\n\nI didn't want a bachelor party when I got married, my friend asked a couple times, then stopped, and they didn't throw one. Your relatives should have done the same.", "NTA.  Re the gifts, perhaps you can consider leaving the gifts at their home until after baby is born, as a compromise and to respect your superstition.  If not, perhaps the giftgivers should have opportunity to refund if you are declining the gifts.  Giving them away will have repercussions to the relationships too, to consider.  They do need to respect your boudaries.", "Not only did they not respect your boundaries, but they ignored a cultural prohibition against assuming good outcomes in the future specifically in connection with the pregnancy of a woman who\u2019s had trouble conceiving and is probably already worried enough about what might still go wrong. Your in-Laws\nSUCK and your husband needs to decide if he\u2019s OK with them dismissing and bullying his wife.", "NTA , your husband should have backed you up at the dinner table when everyone was attacking  you .  Your husband is being a jerk for allowing them to that to you.", "You don't have to be where you don't want to be.", "NTA\n\nBut you have a major husband problem.", "NTA. Doing something someone specifically said they didn't want isn't doing a 'nice thing' for them. It's disregarding their feelings.\n\nRe: the gifts, I understand why you don't want to keep them, but since they're from your husband's family it'd make sense to give more consideration to his wishes there.", "NTA, the baby shower wasn't for you it was for them. You are right but you need to have a serious convo with your husband because a child will only make these kinds of things worse. His family has already shown they are incapable of hearing you, what else will they ignore from your culture as your child grows. Not to mention how rude it was to cut your family out.", "NTA. This was really rude and culturally insensitive. If they\u2019re not going to respect your boundaries now, before the baby is born, that\u2019s a pretty clear sign that they won\u2019t respect any boundaries you set after your child is born either.", "NTA and you have a husband problem.  This is going to get worse after the baby is born.  Make a plan and have lots of talks with your husband.  You need to be on the same page.", "NTA at all. They clearly don't care about your feelings or wishes.\n\nIt's like having a friend who is vegetarian for cultural reasons, trying to convince them to order a steak and them repeatedly telling me that they don't want it and explaining why. So I order it for them anyway and then get upset if they leave the restaurant... Whilst I'm sat there protesting that \"STEAK IS NICE AND I LIKE IT SO YOU SHOULD WANT IT!\"\n\nIt's sad that your husband isn't on your side about this, that's definitely something you need to address with him. Wishing you a happy and healthy remainder of your pregnancy!", "NTA\n\n\nIt's not a baby shower without my people there.\n\n\n Don't disrespect my wishes, then cut out my own damned family and friends.", "The shower against your wishes is similar to serving pork to someone of Arabic background o giving  protein and dairy on the same dish to an observant of the Jewish faith. Your in-laws are sort of racists. They threw that shower for themselves. Just like you respected his culture they should respect yours as well.", "NTA, of course.\n\nIf you're lucky, this will be the wakeup call they need to start respecting you and your cultural differences.  If you're unlucky, this will be the start of going LC or NC with them.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. I would\u2019ve left and been upset also. Your feelings are valid and you are right that they should have respected your wishes. I would be upset with your husband too. He should have your back in this even. An ambush like that is never okay.", "NTA - Sheesh, you let them know how many times that you didn't want a baby shower, then you were unknowingly forced to go to one they planned for you? If that wasn't bad enough, your husband is taking their side. You don't need this stress with the baby, you trying to avoid this mess is reason enough to be wary! \n\nI would keep the gifts myself, but I would understand either decision you make. I hope your hubby comes around and backs you up more going forward.", "NTA, but here is what I don't understand, if someone I loved told me they didn't want a baby shower before the baby was born and explained why I would just ask if we could do it after the baby was born.  \n\nWe had my baby shower after my son was born because I would much rather everyone who was traveling for the shower got to meet my son.  I had no cultural reasons. I just would rather everyone got to meet him instead of traveling to see my giant pregnant self.  A lot of relatives could only make one trip.  I told everyone who we were inviting that I wanted them to meet the baby, and everyone was fine and came out when he was 6 weeks old and gave us gifts, and met the baby.  \n\nThere are ways his family could make this work without trampling all over OP and what she wants.", "Question, did your husband know about the shower beforehand? Cause that would make him the biggest Ahole in this!", "NTA\n\nYou can do whatever you want with a gift\n\nIf you wanted to not use your baby shower they should not be angry", "NTA on everything except donating the gifts. No matter how wrong they were to give you the shower (our family gives one afterwards for the same reason you don't do them.) they spent time, money and thought on the gifts that you will need.

Don\u2019t let this take away from the event you have waited for years to happen in your lives.  As an aside, I too had to deal with outrageous behavior from my in-laws.  It got so bad and I was fed up with my husband saying that I was misunderstanding them and that there was no problem and I was too sensitive.
