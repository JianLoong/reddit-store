Or was this out of left field for her?", "NTA\n\nShe told you she didn't want anything and told you to order what you wanted.\n\nYou got her something.\n\nNow you're in trouble?\n\nYou need to figure out what's going on with her.

You gave her all the benefits; order what she wanted, gave her control, and she flat out told you \"I don't want anything.\" It's not my marriage, but I'd be like \"Honey, I love you, but I'm not psychic. If you tell me I can do something and I do it and you get mad at me over it, you're painting me into a corner here.\" \n\nIf she's frustrated about not knowing what she wanted and not having options she liked, that's not your fault. Ordering what you wanted after she flat out told you to and she gets mad? That's not okay, and she needs to know that it's not okay. It's not gaslighting, but it's manipulative, shitty behavior. It puts the onus of reading her mind on you, and making a situation a win-win when you don't have the tools.", "NTA. And her behaviour sucks. \n\nSomething might be up if she is acting that way. To \u201cstorm\u201d off into the bedroom and than he mad when you ordered? That\u2019s not rational behaviour. \n\nIt sounds so dumb, but maybe try to figure out if something is going on that caused that behaviour.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m also very indecisive, and when I can\u2019t make a decision, my husband will order for both of us. \n\nYou get what you get, and you don\u2019t get upset \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Your wife's behavior is the same stupid shit I do when I'm hangry. But if my husband has picked food and I said no, that's my own damn fault.", "NTA. She gets an F in communication. Hope this isn't a pattern with her.", "NTA.  You said you\u2019d order from anywhere and then she got in a snit.  That\u2019s not on you.  I mean, I know it\u2019s annoying when you can\u2019t decide what you want.  It happens.  But that\u2019s not your fault.  It\u2019s also not like you could have saved them for another night.  They were expiring.  So I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s mad.", "NTA. You did everything necessary. Something is on her mind and clearly bothering her. Take some time and then talk about it calmly.", "How dare you do exactly what she told you to do AND order her something just in case she decided she wanted something? /s\n\nNTA. \n\nI doubt she'd have been happier if you had genuinely ordered her nothing, left her alone, and fulfilled that request, since that was the other option.", "NTA. You did everything you could. With that said, and I\u2019m not here to label or diagnose anyone here, but having had friends and family members show similar behaviours (over this very exact thing) I\u2019d wonder if she experiences anxiety and/or some form of afhd or something within that vicinity. I have a family member who gets like this when going to the grocery store or shopping (or finding something on Netflix). The time pressure, the amount of options, and sheer panic creates a hyper-stimulation of sorts and it can be so overwhelming where a person either shuts down or just becomes emotional. \n\nSo again, NTA, you went out of to her way to still order for both of you. But sometimes what may help is narrowing down options between 1 or 2 things you know she likes so she\u2019s not overwhelmed with options. In that case if the result and outburst is the same then it would be a matter of her having to cope with how she\u2019s feeling and being left alone for a bit to process.", "NTA - kind of a trap here/no win situation other than magically guessing what she would have wanted.\n\nEdit - typo", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 she said she didn\u2019t want anything.

She definitely didn\u2019t want burgers, but she didn\u2019t see anything else that she really wanted, but she was hungry. Therefore, you should have ordered anything but the burgers. Sounds like she had a bad day or isn\u2019t feeling great, but she needs to use her words and communicate here.

Come on, what is this even?\n\nNTA, you're not a mind reader and you were nice enough to actually order her something which I would have not done. In my opinion, and this applies to my husband and I, you play stupid games you win stupid prizes", "NTA. She's a grown ass woman and is more than capable to speaking her needs and getting her own food. Honestly her behavior sounds manipulative and low key a little gaslightish. Does she act like this often? You did everything a considerate partner would do. Her attitude is completely uncalled for and you deserve an apology.", "Was she over hungry ? I'm just looking for a reason. I know if I go to long and my sugar ) glucose drops I get mean. It's not great because when I most need food I am least able to help myself.

Even though a blind man could see she wouldn\u2019t be happy about the burgers I think it\u2019s a good idea to hold women to what they literally say every so often.

That\u2019s incredibly annoying behavior from your wife. Is this a one off or more of a pattern? Expecting to you to read her mind I mean.", "NTA - you are dating a manipulative, controlling person. She refused to order food, told you to to order what you wanted, refused the offer of choosing a different place and then equated all of that with you being selfish and not thinking about her. Take your Uber Eats credits and your free burger and run for the hills.", "NTA. I cannot stand this behavior. I\u2019m someone who has a very hard time choosing what to eat due to recovering from an ED. My stomach literally shrunk and I often get nauseous when I think about eating. So I usually ask my BF what he would like to eat (3-4 options) and then I pick from those options as to what sounds the most tolerable, this way both of us are satisfied with the choice. But when I tell him I\u2019m not hungry, I mean I\u2019m not hungry. Storming off is immature and getting mad at your SO for ordering what they\u2019d like to eat after you specifically said you do not want to eat is selfish. \u201cI don\u2019t want food so you can\u2019t have it\u201d is a really toxic mentality. Maybe she is having a bad day and at that point I would try to see if you can help her, but her acting like a child because you want to eat - a necessary part of life - is totally unfair. Besides, you guys are adults. She\u2019s not a child who\u2019s being forced to eat what mom and dad made for dinner. Most restaurants have other restaurants not just close, but in the same lot. She could have asked to choose from a place nearby and come with so you guys can pick up your respective orders and both enjoy what you want to eat.", "Sorry but there's got to be something else going on to piss her off. \n\nDoes she even like burgers?

It's a symptom of something else so you'd definitely benefit from an open conversation about it.

She wanted you to  think about what she might like and order her something with the credits. Sometimes, people can feel overburdened by mental load and just need to make one decision less, are just indecisive or are just having a bad day and need to feel looked after. She could have communicated this better if it applied to her. \n\nSomewhere in the back of your mind, you recognize that she might want to eat later, so you do a nice thing and order enough for her. But your order burgers, the thing she specifically said she did not want. So, it kind of comes off as if you ignored her preferences and you weren\u2019t really trying to make a super nice gesture for her after all. I get why you did it, but this is not a black and white right or wrong. Your wife needed time to decompress and didn\u2019t want a burger. If she\u2019s not normally like this, give her a bit of grace and she may tell you what the issue is when she feels better. \n\nSometimes, unusual food reactions can be a sign of your body telling you something.
