It was Thursday and around 1pm (a time when I usually wouldn't be home) I had a worker fixing some things in my yard, so he was making a reasonable amount of noise. That day I had not parked my car in the garage and was working from home in my living room looking down the street. When I looked up I saw my neighbor peeking into my house, noticing that my car was not there and running in shouting things at my worker (how was it possible that he was making noise, that she was trying to sleep, that he was not polite, that he was shameless, bla bla).\n\nWhen I realized this situation, I ran out to where she was and yelled at her (what do you think you are doing?) to which she turns around and starts yelling at me (all this inside my property). I start to get upset and tell her: I don't care about your point of view, it's 1 o'clock in the afternoon, get off my property or I will call the police. She kept yelling at me and saying that I had to be quite because she was an old lady.\n\nMy boyfriend heard all the commotion and came out to see what was going on. She turned to look at my boyfriend, turned to look at me and said, \"Now I get it, you're a couple of s\\*\\* f\\*\\*s. That's why you think you can argue with me. Now I get it, you are just a couple of fa\\*\\*\\*s.\u201d To which I took out my cell phone, started recording and replied: \"Repeat again what you just said.\u201d And she, with all certainty, repeated it. Adding that we were going to hell and that God was going to punish us.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that I am a lawyer, so I warned her that if she continued like that there would be legal consequences. She finally got off my property and went home. I went back to mine and with the anger I had at the time, I drafted and filed a discrimination and trespassing complaint against my neighbor. I was about to upload the video to social media but my boyfriend (rightfully so) stopped me from doing it.\n\nNow, a week after the incident, I have been notified that my complaint has been accepted. My boyfriend and my friends are telling me that I took things too far by suing her, but I still believe that it is only the consequences of her own actions, her comments were homophobic and very offensive.\n\nAITA for filing a lawsuit against her?", "created_utc": 1691418071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15km40x/aita_for_suing_my_75_year_old_neighbor/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do it for you and for all the people who get abuse and can't do much about it.\n\nClearly this isn't the first time this woman has said stuff like this, but it could be the last!", "Ultimately no NTA but I can see it. I\u2019m only confused on the living situation. It reads that your boyfriend moved into your house over a year ago, and you have lived there for four. If this is correct, ignore my YTA comment. As it\u2019s your property and you can do as you see fit. \nShe\u2019s an old batty lady who is very MUCH an ass who has nothing better to do than be the town neighborhood watch. \n\nI dunno what it means by your complaint being accepted and what not. But I\u2019m sure a piece of paper from some enforcement agency would definitely keep her nose out of your property. If not further steps and more serious things can be brought up I\u2019m sure. But I ain\u2019t a lawyer.\n\nYTA - if this was his neighbor at his house you have lived in and you went behind his back to sue the neighbor. You\u2019re creating a longer situation between him and the neighbor that you may not even be in the picture for in the future.", "NTA - Fuck around and find out. I got 6 workers fired from my cladding works on my block of flats after some darn right unsavoury language. It only took one complaint. I can guarantee they wont be doing that again.", "No. Go forward, if she's old enough to speak such hate, she's old enough to learn the consequences", "[removed]", "NTA. Considering her age, think about all the people she has victimized till now. It's only recently that the law gives you the right to give this kind of people what they deserve. It was about time in her case, in 'her time', you could get people arrested for being gay, and there are chances that she even destroyed lives that way. If she won't feel neither shame nor guilt, you don't need to either.", "NTA, age is no excuse for bigotry.", "NTA\n\nIt's honestly the safest way to deal with crazy old people.", "you got slurred by someone on your own property. NTA. you wouldn\u2019t worry about suing if a 27 year old did this.", "NTA. She may have mental health issues or she may not but that doesn't mean you have to put up with that behavior. Do what you have to do.", "Sue her, absolutely. Maybe next time she\u2019ll think twice. Absolutely awful. NTA", "NTA. She sounds unhinged as well as being nasty and homophobic. She also deliberately checked to see if you were home before harassing the worker which shows that she knows it was wrong. I would do as much as you possibly can legally as she seems like the type of person to continually bother you and escalate.", "NTA\n\nSo much pain is just accepted because it's dealt by the elderly. If it had been a person in their 20's or 30's, it wouldn't be accepted, so why is it any different if the attacker is in their 70's? Hopefully they'll learn to not trespass on other people's property and verbally attack them.", "YTA for ignoring your boyfriends point of view as your lawsuit also affects him and his neighbor. How you treated the lady was fine for the record. \n\nRelationships involve understanding how your actions impact those around you. If you and your s/o are sharing occupancy of a property, how you handle neighbor conflicts is a joint decision.  If my s/o did this and ignored my PoV, I would be upset with her. I am fairly sure she would be upset with me too.", "NTA. You asked her to say it again and she can see you're recording and yet she still thought there was nothing wrong with saying it. Having let herself into your house for the pleasure.", "NTA. Old age is not an excuse to be homophobic. You have to live next door to this old biddy, so you need to make it crystal clear you won\u2019t put up with any of her bullshit.", "NTA - If you let her get away with saying these things to you on your property, what is to stop her from saying them to someone else in public? Just because you're old, doesn't give you a free pass to be an ass.", "Nta, fuck old racist bigots,\n\nPlus she's 75, if you get a payout, (I have no idea what the end result of a lawsuit like this would be) it's not like she's gunna need that money for much longer regardless", "NTA. Age is no excuse for her behavior. I would say that she is probably several decades overdue for experiencing the consequences for her actions.", "NTA - She\u2019s an homophobic bigot who needs to learn that there are consequences to her disgusting, unacceptable behaviour.\n\nIf she felt that it was ok to act like this towards you and your boyfriend, she will be comfortable doing it again if she is not put into her place. \n\nI support your decision and lawsuit.", "NTA. Not a bit.", "This story is really hitting my \u201cfake\u201d button. What country are you from? \n\nYou claim to be a lawyer and you say you want to trespass her, which you could\u2019ve done when she was on your property by calling the police but you didn\u2019t. So now you want to trespass someone that\u2019s not trespassing. Either you\u2019re using English terms that don\u2019t legally translate or you mean to say you want a restraining order. \n\nSecondly, you want to \u201csue her for discrimination.\u201d Once again, either you\u2019re not in America or you\u2019re a lawyer that doesn\u2019t know the law. There\u2019s nothing illegal about being a bigot and in reality, being a slur loving bigot is emphatically legal. \n\nMaybe this is a translation error from a different nation. Maybe this is a story from someone that\u2019s upset at their neighbor and is fantasizing about how much they\u2019d sue if they were a lawyer.\n\nEdit: also same question for everyone in the comments. Wtf country are you from where you can sue someone for calling you a slur?", "I perfectly understand your question. It is my house, I bought it 4 years ago.

Got to nip it in the bud, or she'll keep going at it.", "I should not have laughed as loudly as I did at this", "In UK you can go down the police route, as it is a hate crime. These kind of cases will end up in court.", "In Germany you can sue people for slurs ^^", "I don't want to trespass... at no time did I say I wanted that. I have no idea where you got the idea from. I said I filed a complaint for trespassing. \n\nI could have called the police but there would have been no point, by the time the police arrived she would have left my property and I could only proceed by filing a complaint (which I did).\n\n\r  \nI am not from the US. I am from Mexico where there is a law against discrimination, so yes, I can legally proceed (I already did). Obviously the legal consequence will be neither to put her in jail nor to take her house away, that was never the intention.\n\n\r  \nIt may be a translation error so I may not have been able to convey the situation exactly, my bad.\n\n\r  \nI mean, I have the video if you want proof, there is no fantasizing here.", "Perfect. You\u2019re hunky dory and you do as you see fit IMO. But if you\u2019re feeling it\u2019s too strong. I do think just a paper document will put her right. If not.. gotta do what you gotta do.\n\nSorry about your neighbor. I have an old fella as mine and he is the kindest person.", "Maybe it\u2019s different in the UK, but my googling seems to confirm it\u2019s the same as the US. in order for it to be a hate crime, it has to first be a crime and secondly be hateful. \n\nBeing mean isn\u2019t a crime, so this isn\u2019t a hate crime. \n\nTo cite what I found:\n\n> Any crime can be prosecuted as a hate crime if the offender has either: demonstrated hostility based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity Or been motivated by hostility based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity\n\nSo, it\u2019s not a hate crime unless it\u2019s first a crime.", "Care to cite the law? I\u2019m only seeing laws that makes it illegal to slur people in public and this took place on OP\u2019s private property.", "Oh ok Mexico. That makes sense.", "The fact that it has been accepted means that it has the legal basis to proceed. Now I have to present further proof if I want to continue, which I think I will not do for now. \n\nI will leave it as a legal precedent and a way to keep her out of my business.\n\nBut thanks for you input.
