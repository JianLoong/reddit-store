Health care professionals should never have to navigate vague legal or statutory language to determine whether the law allows them to exercise their professional judgment and provide evidence-based care.  \nAny application of an abortion ban that affects those in need of treatment for ectopic pregnancy is inappropriate and will certainly cost lives.\n\nIn particular it\u2019s unclear that ectopic pregnancies in caesarian scars are not subject to abortion bans because they aren\u2019t always fatal and they may be viable, so do not necessarily qualify as \u201cemergencies\u201d as defined in legislation. \n\n+++ +++ +++\n\nAbortion bans can be surprisingly difficult to interpret. [Ireland\u2019s killed Savita Halappanavar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) even though it appeared to clearly allow termination in her case. \n\n> The law in force at the time stated that the act of abortion, where there was no immediate physiological threat to the woman's life to continue the pregnancy, was a criminal offence punishable by life imprisonment. Following a ruling of the Supreme Court of Ireland in 1992 \u2013 now known in Ireland as the X case \u2013 **terminations are allowed under certain circumstances, where \"a pregnant woman's life is at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide\".** However at the time of Halappanavar's death, there was **legal uncertainty regarding the precise circumstances in which this exception to preserve the life of the mother would apply in practice, as the matter had not yet been enacted in legislation.**\n\nShe was dying of sepsis. Everyone knew she was dying of sepsis. The pregnancy was nonviable. Everyone knew that the treatment was immediate termination. She died of sepsis. \n\nIf they had followed medical standards and intervened to save her life her doctors risked going to prison for life because the law was still \u201cuncertain.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m going with ACOG here. Abortion bans can affect care for ectopic pregnancy.", "And that\u2019s why abortion laws have become difficult to interpret.

One rather anti abortion woman I know was very upset to have to go to a medical practice that mostly performed 2nd trimester abortions to get treatment for her 2nd trimester miscarriage. This is because unless you perform 2nd trimester abortions it is hard to become proficient at safely removing the contents of a uterus in the 2nd trimester. Some obgyns can do it but it\u2019s risky without enough experience since the uterus is very fragile at that point. Some people say well just do a c-section to remove the dead fetus but that can leave the uterus in no condition to have another pregnancy.", "I don\u2019t like that system", "Nothing is ever gonna change about it until someone has the guts to get rid of lobbyists", "Neither do I.
