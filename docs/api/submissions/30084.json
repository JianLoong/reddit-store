Don't know why the younger sister is so insecure, especially since Chris said what he said.\n\nIf it was \"you two should've ended up together\" it would be much worse, and deserving the \"YTA\"", "YTA, and so is Chris. It was really insensitive to tell Julia that you always expected her boyfriend to end up with a specific other person, especially when that person is her sister, and is sitting right there. Chris made the situation worse by saying that Bianca was \"too good for me.\" So congratulations on both making Julia feel like Chris settled for second choice. Why did you think it was a funny \"joke\" to make her feel like that?

I told my boyfriend \"ohhhh fuck you\" in a joking way but it still hurt his feelings (not that it matters because if he is hurt he is hurt but he was verbally abused by his dad and so it dug a lot deeper into him) and when he said to please not do that again I immediately apologized, told he I meant it as a joke and that I wouldn't do it again. He said \"I know you were joking and thank you.\" \n\nIt is okay to explain your actions, sometimes though a person may be really hurt and not care about the intention or you might go overboard explaining yourself where it gets overly defensive.  But in general it is okay and will be well received if it is paired with a genuine apology.", "It's problematic for 2 reasons. First, no she wasn't joking and Julia knows it. Second, it sets OP up for failure by implicitly committing to never to make an actual joke that offends the Julia.\n\nI advise people to never apologize for things they did intentionally - like making a joke - because these apologies are worthless. You did it because you meant to do it, you can't apologize for that. Once OP does realize why it was offensive they can and should apologize for their actual mistake.\n\nIf OP concludes that she implied her sister is a poor match for Chris, and she didn't intend to do so, then that's what she should apologize for.\n\nIf OP concludes that she facilitated flirting between Chris and Bianca, and she didn't intend to do so, then that's what she should apologize for.\n\nIf OP concludes she was being dismissive and disrespectful of Julia and Chris' relationship, and she didn't intend to do so, then that's what she should apologize for.", "Impact trumps intent and if you use that to explain you understand your impact trumped your intent, yes.

That's like, similar to why bringing up your exes is a red flag, what exactly is the point being made here? Chris fucked up for sure but he definitely got set up in the moment.", "OP didn\u2019t say that, nor did they intend that. The sister\u2019s apparently very insecure in her relationship, because I feel like an emotionally healthy response would just be to laugh along.

I don\u2019t see how OPs comment could be so horrendous, it\u2019s really not much to get worked up over.

How does that not leave you wondering \"do you really think that?\" It sounds like the only part you're sorry for is saying it out loud. \n\nIt doesn't matter what it is, I'd like to know the reason.

Not just sorry with no reason to help me understand.", "And the bf responded with \"nah, she's too good for me,\" not \"Haha, no, we'd never fit as a couple, but I'm glad we're still friends,\" which means odds are decent that there is in fact at least a one-sided attraction between Bianca and the bf, which could DEFINITELY bring about some insecurities.

He and Amy are right for eachother, and the rest of the series confirms that he and Jo remained BFFs with no issues.\n\nThe difference is that in the Little Women series the issue is dropped, Laurie has clearly moved on, and all four people including Jo's husband are fully aware that everyone wound up with the right partners and the admittedly deep relationship between Laurie and Jo is not a threat.  In OP's story, it sounds like everyone might not convinced that Chris and Bianca shouldn't have ended up together, and Chris fumbled by not finding a response between \"she's too good for me\" (ouch!) and \"Ew, no way!\".

Makes it sound like he's settling for Julia.\n\nThen Julia gets mad at OP. Julia then becomes the 2nd AH - she should be mad at Chris; he's the one who made the hurtful comment, but she redirects that at her sister (I guess for even \"bringing it up\" in the first place, which gave Chris an opportunity to put his foot in his mouth).\n\nAt that point, OP should've just said, \"my bad, I didn't mean any offense. I won't joke about this again\" but didn't.

Again some friends may understand but this is a straight shot from a sister is best response arguably would have just been to say that he was with julie and leave it alone. But I feel like there is a lot that has happend behind the scenes. My theory is that chris and Bianca were together and julie was jealous for years chris and Bianca broke up.

I\u2019d say fabricating a discussion/lying is more \u201ctactless\u201d than anything anyone in this situation did.", "That totally makes sense! And if all three really had been joking about it, I would have absolutely been confused at the weirdness too.", "YTA because that\u2019s not a \u201cjoke\u201d and Chris is a bigger AH because he decided to pour gasoline on a fire when he added his take on the matter.", "Yta that's completely out of pocket of your girlfriend to say. The fact you agreed and added to it is mind blowing to me. The fact he defacto said older sis is better than little sis!? \n\nY'all are AWFUL. Julia never should have had to hear any of that, every single person at the gathering owes her a heart felt apology.", "A joke has a punchline and in this case you made it your sister.\n\nYTA, it was a very insensitive thing to say. And more so when Chris said she's too good for me. It makes Julia think she was the second pick since he couldn't get with the first sister.", "NTA. The boyfriends response is what upset her. Not only did he imply that her sister is better then her he also implied that if he thought he had a chance with her he would take it. You\u2019re both trash but he\u2019s the AH.", "YTA, you\u2019re also either too dumb or too immature to realize (or admit) how that\u2019s offensive.", "NTA, and her explanation in your edit makes sense.  Chris's comment was cruel.  It sounded like he was \"settling\" for the girl who was not quite as good as the other.  He is going to have some work to do to dig himself out of that hole.", "NTA. Everyone here saying you should never had said that at all is ridiculous. It was a harmless comment that I\u2019m sure other people around them thought as well. She knew about their history when they started talking on Instagram. If it\u2019s something she\u2019s insecure about she shouldn\u2019t have pursued the relationship to begin with. Seems like they might have never discussed that previously though. No need to defend it by saying it was just a joke when it really wasn\u2019t. Chris on the other hand is definitely the asshole here! Like WTF? If she wasn\u2019t insecure before, she definitely would be after that and who could blame her. Glad you apologized given how Chris responded, but please don\u2019t blame yourself because he made the worst possible situation out of your comment.", "YTA lol this was so nasty for no reason", "This is bad pls apologize", "OP gives \u201cit\u2019s just a prank bro\u201d energy. YTA", "yta, but chris is even more of an AH for that comment. definitely made julia insecure", "YTA  \nHow come this is even something to ask if you are an AH or not?  \nIf you say something and suddenly the mood changes that should be telling enough for you to know it was because of your comment.", "YTA. That was just utterly inappropriate to say. How did you think they were going to react? It doesn\u2019t matter that your older sister isn\u2019t dating him. Your other sister *is* and *their* happiness is what matters.", "YTA, but Chris is even more of an ass hole. \n\nWhat you said was insensitive and inappropriate in every way. What he said was\u2026 to me,  unforgivable. \n\nWhen he said, \u201cNah she\u2019s too good for me,\u201d it implied she was good enough for him and he sees her sister as \u201cbetter\u201d than both of them. \n\nThat\u2019s not something I would ever forgive, personally. \n\nYou may an ass hole but Chris might be dumped lol", "Wow what a great big brother. I sincerely suggest you apologize, that was a big fuck up on ur part. And ur girlfriend should be ashamed of her own comment as well. The boyfriend on the other hand should be dumped, that was absolutely disgusting of him to say, he basically inferred he had a thing for the other sister and that his girlfriend was second runner up. You all suck and I feel sorry for your sister.", "Always keep it real. Stay true to you.", "Saying that you thought Chris and Bianca would get together wasn't a joke, it was actually what you guys thought when they were younger. Chris, in a bid to not hurt Bianca's feelings, was the asshole because he implied that Julia wasn't as good at Bianca.  That's where the hurt comes from.  Maybe a lot of people who think before they speak would have avoided the whole subject but geez you were comfortable with friends and family. NTA", "Bruh is tryna switch sisters OP", "What about what the bf said? The other sister is too good for him? Meaning his current gf isn\u2019t??", "Definitely YTA. Or even E S H but Julia.\n\nAnd YTA to the gf for bringing up Little Women. So insensitive to joke like that.\n\nThen Chris' reaction 'she's too good for me.' WTF. He doesn't want to make fun or negative joke but that just sounds like since he can't get with the older sis, the younger sis is like a consolation prize OR younger sis is not so great so he can 'get' with her. YIKES.\n\nGood that you apologize, so she can then turn around and soothe you by saying she knew you didn't mean anything by it. Julia sounds like a nice young woman.", "I find it interesting how people are not acknowledging what Chris said. He basically said he decided to Julia as the next best thing, practically making her second place in a way. OP may have stated a fact, but still that does not excuse. Op also sucks because she downplayed Julia by saying it was a joke rather than apologizing. If OP apologized, I would probably give a VERY soft N T A but Chris is.\n\nExcept for OP's gf and OP's sisters, ESH, OP for stating an unnecessary fact and not apologizing, and Chris for playing along and upsetting the situation.", "YTA you must hate Julia", "As someone from an ethnic/cultural background that often favors the older/oldest and had talents that *weren't* favored in the family and culture but had a sibling that had all the ones valued...  This is devastating.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had situations similar, thinking someone wanted to hang out with me/be my friend because we seemed aligned personality-wise only to learn they were more interested in being friends with my sibling.  It really ruins you and you never feel secure in your standing with others.  It's bad enough being compared by family members, it's awful when people say and do things that make it clear you're some sort of substitute.  And a poor, hollow imitation of what they apparently prefer.", "Exaaaactly. I\u2019ll even say Chris was the most inappropriate. He, out the whole group, has the most emotional impact and responsibility to his partner.", "If Julia didn\u2019t grow up with Chris and Bianca I\u2019d agree, but she knew about this history and their closeness along with everyone else. The comment on its face was harmless. If Julia is that insecure about the close relationship her BF had with HER OWN SISTER she shouldn\u2019t have pursued the relationship. That being said, Chris is the asshole here! If Julia wasn\u2019t insecure about the relationship before, she has every reason to be after such a comment. All he had to say was \u201cnah she\u2019s not my type\u201d, \u201cI found what I was looking for\u201d, or \u201cnah she\u2019s the homie\u201d. Like literally anything other than \u201cshe\u2019s too good for me\u201d implying that Bianca is somehow a tier above Julia.", "It could've been a bad self-deprecating joke, like \"She didn't want a schmuck like me anyway\" that came out completely wrong because he talked her up instead of putting himself down directly.\n\nThe benefit of the doubt to him comes from \"she's too good for me\" being fairly undescriptive. Had he said something like, \"I couldn't get the hot one\" or \"I struck out with my dream girl,\" yeah, it'd be more malicious, but \"too good\" vague enough if he also admits that he was just trying to deflect the comment and didn't realize that it technically implied \"but her sister isn't as good.\"\n\nIt could honestly go either way.", "no i totally agree with you, i can\u2019t believe someone could even say something like this to their sister.", "Ironically the way he responded IS very little women coded...", "You\u2019re family really fucking sucks.", "Sounds like a innocent comment to get past a akward remark??? Holy fuck im glad im not so insecure about my relationship as most people here.", "Very Christ-like indeed", "Imho leave the word \"joke\" out of it - say \"I'm sorry, that sounded different in my head. I shouldn't have said it.\" or something. The word joke still makes it seem like you're implying they're being unreasonable when you're the one who ought to be taking that blame.", "I imagine that Chris was just thrown off by OP's weird comment, and just said the first thing that he could think of that wouldn't offend Bianca but would also out to rest the idea of dating Bianca. \n\nI mean, honestly, what the hell kind of response is he supposed to say to that? That he was never attracted to Julia? That he asked her out but she said no? Even when you have time to craft a perfect response it is difficult to do so, and he was put on the spot and (I'm guessing) wanted to immediately squash the weird concept.\n\nOP said something that was objectively weird and likely made people feel uncomfortable, and the BF tried and failed to defuse it. Honestly OP is more to blame for what the BF said that the BF is, IMO.", "that isn't OP's fault? OP never implied Bianca was too good for him or anything of the sort, just \"you guys were so close I thought you'd end up together\". Chris' ass is the one who blurted that shit out so you can be mad at him for it. OP never implied what chris said, wasn't trying to lead them into that, just made a comment.  \nEdit: per OP's edit, I am correct in my thought here", "comprehension goes a long way babe", "I guess I didn\u2019t read that scenario.", "Yes! Instead, compliment your partner and affirm that you're with the right person. If you want to stay with that partner at least", "this very much so feels more like a \"oh fuck, this is awkward, lets say something to get the topic dropped\" response not a genuine one.", "Avoiding drama, some basic trust and not a insane amount of insecurerty also goes a long way buddy.", "I mean, yah. Just cause a situation goes bad doesnt mean anyone was specifically an asshole.", "I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with them hitting you and telling you it didn\u2019t hurt (wow\u2026.just\u2026.wow). I definitely understand why that can still piss you off sometimes. \n\nIt is nice that you have all been able to forge a pretty close relationship as adults.", "It's not her fault at all. They matched on Internet. And the sister and that guy weren't even a thing. Just cause some dumb fantasies existed, didn't mean lil sis seriously had to think that her bf would fawn for some childhood chrush still. That's sick.", "We were quick to forgive as kids, too. But siblings gotta sibling, I guess", "I agree body language & context makes a big difference. And of course some \"explanations\" veer into making excuses. But I'm so confused when people say they don't want explanations. I don't want to be left wondering, \"but why would you do/say that (in the first place)?\"", "If you think this guy and the older sister weren\u2019t close enough where she knew who he was I think you\u2019re infantilizing the younger sister.", "I have ASD/ADHD. I'm in my 40s & constantly have to ask myself \"If someone said this to me how would I feel\" because empathy does not come naturally to me.\n\nI still make an effort though. OP was just flat out rude.", "I am diagnosed neurodivergent. One of the most important things to learn is not saying everything you think immediately. Even before I realised that I was definitely not blurting out things that could only hurt people like OP did.", "That doesn't mean she should assume that the guy she's with has weird hang up on her sister. Everyone goes all about trust yet you say she shouldn't trust her own bf", "The original comment was already insensitive.", "I\u2019ve never dated my older sisters best friend so idk but it seems like she should\u2019ve known better. And HE CERTAINLY should have.", "It wasn\u2019t to anyone who hasn\u2019t got the emotional security of a 14 year old.", "What's the guy supposed to say though, he got put on the spot in front of both sisters and had to come up with something that wasn't like \"Oh I'm not attracted to her AT ALL\" about the older one.", "Yeah this was a painful thing to even READ, so much awkwardness... But in his defense, maybe he just had no idea what to say and tried to say something complimentary to his old friend, not really thinking through how it was insulting his gf?\n\nETA: I would have a hard time forgetting my bf said this, so I'm not downplaying it - I'm just saying it's possible he (unfortunately) said the wrong thing out of discomfort.", "Sounds about right", "Yeah\u2026 I don\u2019t understand why people think that OP was such an AH. The real AH here is Chris.", "I\u2019d like to point out that we were all (except for Bianca, who doesn\u2019t drink) very drunk, in my defense.", "A funny thing about little women is that, despite all the onscreen chemistry between the actors playing jo and laurie, book jo REALLY never sees laurie that way at all, thinking how great it\u2019d be for him to end up with meg+at one point thinking beth is in love with him. Laurie is obviously heartbroken, but he does realize that he loves jo as a sister and that amy is the one he truly loves, amy refuses to accept laurie until she\u2019s sure he\u2019s not just using her as a replacement for her sister. I seriously encourage redditors to read the book for themselves, because it gives the answer to why amy ends up with laurie, and why jo really didn\u2019t deserve the europe trip.", "I mean, in Bianca\u2019s defense, she\u2019s a pretty conflict averse person in general. Tbh the only person I\u2019ve ever seen her really get into it with someone was Chris back when they were closer. They\u2019d fully go at it, but with most other people, she doesn\u2019t like to get involved. It\u2019d be weirder if she HAD said something", "The difference between an explanation and an excuse is how the apology is said. To have a good apology you need understanding of why why you did was wrong and what you will do in the future to avoid it.\n\nFor this one I would say \u201cI meant what I said as a joke but I now realize that it wasn\u2019t funny and that I hurt you. I\u2019m sorry for that, I won\u2019t joke like that in the future.\u201d", "They did though\n\nOP made reference and then there was  Little Women conversation \n\nIt wasn't just one remark and done - it was a detailed and lengthy discussion about other sister and bf's shared past, compatibility and comparisons to literary characters.", "Tell your sister that she can do better than her \u201cnah she\u2019s too good for me,\u201d boyfriend and find someone who won\u2019t talk about her like he\u2019s settling for second best.", "Yes, exactly! That's how I've always understood a good apology. Plus, if it applies, the element of \"making right\" - for example, if you broke something, replacing it.   \n\n\nThe no explanations thing is similar to how some people misunderstand the saying that \"intent =/= impact\" into thinking intent doesn't matter. Of course it matters! I'm going to view a person who accidentally stomps my foot very differently than someone who did it on purpose. Intent not equaling impact just means recognizing you still owe an apology even if you didn't do it on purpose, not that intent has no bearing on the situation or shouldn't be explained.", "The Little Women thing is described as a one-off comment made by OP\u2019s girlfriend, and then OP made a comment in response. So yeah, one and done on OP\u2019s behalf as they\u2019ve described it. Not sure where you\u2019re seeing otherwise. The discussion that preceded this was not OP\u2019s. You are literally just making things up.", "In my social circles, saying something like this wouldn\u2019t even make people bat an eye. \n\nI think the most common joke in my family is that my aunt and mom should\u2019ve switched partners. \n\nWeird that OP didn\u2019t know her own sister well enough to know her insecurities, but I would still see it as an honest mistake."]}
