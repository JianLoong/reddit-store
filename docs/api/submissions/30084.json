It was really insensitive to tell Julia that you always expected her boyfriend to end up with a specific other person, especially when that person is her sister, and is sitting right there. Chris made the situation worse by saying that Bianca was \"too good for me.\" So congratulations on both making Julia feel like Chris settled for second choice. Why did you think it was a funny \"joke\" to make her feel like that?

She may not be instantly forthcoming but there's something in that statement that either made her feel insecure or in some way hurt her feelings. I have 7 sisters and know something I may have thought was completely innocuous could be something be a  huge fear or insecurity for them. Open a line of communication and let her know you didn't mean to upset her and would avoid this in the future but you were unaware of the way she interpreted it and hopefully no hard feelings.
