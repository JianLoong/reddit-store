My wife was born and raised and has lived her whole live in this country, and things are a bit more old school here. She told me that it's tradition for the groom to give a gift to bride's family, and at first I thought it was no big deal, but then when I found out more about I started to be against it. \n\nTypically the bride will ask her parents what is a suitable amount for the gift, which involves cash and gold I guess. They told her I should give $3000 n cash and then gold jewelry and poop which will be another $1000 basically. I thought this was nuts! For context, the average salary in this country is only around $500 per month so this is a *lot* of money by local standards. Her family is quite well off though (parents are in their late 50s and both retired) so it's not like they need financial help I think. I already have to pay for the wedding 100% myself (it also tradition here for the groom to do that) where we have to invite her very large extended family as well as dozens and dozens of her parents' family friends, meaning our wedding will be around 300 guests. This all going to cost me so much, to the point that I worry I can barely afford it. Not only is this a lot of money, but it doesn't sit well with me that I basically have to pay a dowry for her. It feels like something from the 1800s and quite misogynistic. \n\nI've told my fiance all of this and now she's very upset with me. She says her parents are quite traditional and there's no way they will accept our marriage if I don't give the gifts. Supposedly, if I don't give the gifts, it'll look like I don't care about her and our marriage will have bad luck. Her sister (30F) is married already and I guess her husband (32M) gave the gifts at their wedding. My fiance has stopped answering my texts now, and I'm wondering AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify a couple things.\n\nI can afford it, but I'm a bit of a penny pincher, so it's a lot for me,  spending over $10k to get married makes me uncomfortable. Seems silly when that money could be invested for our future instead.\n\nI've been here quite a few years, but no close friends have gotten married so I never really learned about wedding traditions before\n\nEdit 2: I got some amazing news, my fianc\u00e9 just found out she\u2019s pregnant and now her family doesn\u2019t want us to spend money on a wedding or gift (still the poop tho) so we can save for the baby. Who knew I just had to knock her up to get out of the wedding **and** the gift, this baby really killed two birds with one stone! \n\nWe\u2019re just going to have a very small wedding ceremony now and they\u2019re going to tell me more about that shortly", "created_utc": 1674831396, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mmsu8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_a_traditional/", "score": 1108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you guys can compromise and prioritize the gift to the parents but cut down on the number of guests? Or maybe she can fully cover the honeymoon? Many options here.\n\nYour attitude is a problem tho - calling the gifting or Kalym misogynistic is very disrespectful and kinda ignorant tbh. Kalym practices started at the times females were the main providers so the gifting was meant to help the parents of the brides to sustain the lose of the breadwinner.

He did all this willingly in order to endear himself as much as possible to his new in-laws.  They've been married 11 years and have three little boys (and the children, I'm sure, have gone a long way toward smoothing over the cultural differences, as grandchildren often do).

Not exactly the same though; in mine, the dowry (yes, it\u2019s a dowry) is usually used to cover a portion of the bride\u2019s reception expenses (grooms family will usually have their own, folks rarely opt for a joint reception). And there\u2019s no set value amount to to the gold; usually a ring or a bracelet or a whole set if the groom and his family can afford it. \n\nMy thing is\u2026 this will not be your only cultural clash with her. This may not even be the worst (but maybe the most expensive). If you really can\u2019t afford it, maybe you can talk to her AND her parents and come up with some kind of compromise to lower the dowry (yes, it\u2019s dowry) and the gold value. I would advise that you tread carefully as to not insult her culture, despite your personal feelings about this. Like, I hope you did not use the word silly like you did here. You\u2019re just gonna come off as insensitive. \n\nYou need to keep in mind that a wedding can be a really big deal, and they can be expensive. This is just a fact regardless of the culture. In fact, in my country, 10k in USD is pretty average for those living in bigger cities. So if you can afford it and your future wife knows it, then you also need to be prepared to fork out this money, or to not marry her, if either of you feel like this is a dealbreaker.\n\nEdit: I also want to say that, in my culture, the amount of dowry can also be seen as a sign of your capability to take care of her financially. Old fashioned? Definitely. Also in mine, if the dowry is not used as to cover wedding expenses, the money is usually meant for your future wife. Maybe you can also ask her this (though I reiterate, please be respectful whatever her response is).", "NTA\n\nOP you might to do at least a bit of research on the traditional customs of the country you are living in.

In my experience with my own culture and other similar cultures, like all parents, Asian parents want what's best for their children, but their idea of \"what's best\" prioritizes financial stability over romantic passion/emotions, especially because a lot of them also expect that their children (and subsequently their children's spouses) will care for them in their old age. I agree that it's problematic, but I feel like in most cases the logic isn't \"my daughter is worth X amount of money for you to buy her from me,\" it's more like \"If you can show that you are able to comfortably part with X amount of money and not have it be a financial hardship, it will prove that you are good enough for our daughter because it shows you have sufficient means to provide for her.\"", "NTA.

It might be helpful for you to understand why these traditions are in place. During historical times, it is customary and required for the groom to present to the brides family at the betrothal ceremony gifts. These would include, money, a roasted suckling pig, dried seafood, wine, fruit, wife cakes, and 24k jewelry. Each dialect/region has a slightly modified list of what to prepare. Each item has some sort of significance and everything must come in pairs of even numbers. \n\nBack in the day, women leave their families and go live with the grooms side. Which means the brides side loses a helping hand. If they were say farmers, they would lose a body to help till the lands. This is why a considerable amount of money is given as compensation for taking away a helping hand. \n\nEven now during modern times, a lot of families still practice this tradition as Asia is still deeply rooted in Asian culture. It would be considered not giving your in-laws face if you decided to forgo this. 3k is actually not a lot of money considering that I\u2019m hearing from my moms friends who still live in Asia that the going amount is anywhere from 30k-80k USD. (I know, it\u2019s a lot and even I was flabbergasted how they could afford this. Now I\u2019m not sure if this is directly correlated but it sounds like because of the one child policy, families who had 1 son save all their life to come up with a sizeable betrothal gift so their son can marry the very few eligible females.) There is a huge sex discrepancy between males and females because during the one child policy males were the preferred gender. So females were abandoned or died therefore leaving Chinas population heavily male.) \n\nAnyway, I went off topic. I\u2019m born in North America and even here, my parents required us to fulfill the betrothal ceremony. For context, my husband presented the following: \n\n20k USD, 24 Karat golden phoenix and dragon bangles with earrings and necklace, whole roasted baby suckling pig, wine, dried seafood, wife cakes, some other pastries and bakery cards for the brides family to give out when they send invites to their side of the family. \n\nMy side of the family had to provide \u201creturn gifts\u201d they send back half the money and prepared some wine, new pants/wallet/watch, and half the pastries along with some other stuff I don\u2019t remember. \n\nMy parents have done well for themselves, so they told my husband the remaining money that is kept on the bride side will go back to us with interest when we purchase a home and that\u2019s exactly what they did when we bought our house. So pretty  much my parents didn\u2019t keep a penny of the money given. But at least I\u2019m the eyes of family and close relatives, they could say \u201coh, my son-in-law gave 20k\u201d AKA, they have face. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested: here\u2019s a good article on what the [Guo Dai Lai](https://web.ourbigday.hk/everything-you-need-to-know-about-guo-da-li/) is. \n\nAnd then a more detailed account is here: [Guo Dai Lai](https://myabctraditions.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/weddings-part-i-guo-dai-lai-the-engagement-party/)", "Info: poop??", "Weird such a traditional family would be cool with her being pregnant/premarital sex l", "Y'all are giving such sincere responses to someone whose username is \"master of bait,\" said that his fiances family wants his literal poop, and updated in less than a day with a baby. \n\nI hope someone who will actually use this reads this, it's very thoughtful.", "To be fair, it could also just be a clash of Conservative parents vs not so Conservative friend groups\n\nI'm SEA and traditionally the grooms family pays for the wedding.
