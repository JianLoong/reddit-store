My wife was born and raised and has lived her whole live in this country, and things are a bit more old school here. She told me that it's tradition for the groom to give a gift to bride's family, and at first I thought it was no big deal, but then when I found out more about I started to be against it. \n\nTypically the bride will ask her parents what is a suitable amount for the gift, which involves cash and gold I guess. They told her I should give $3000 n cash and then gold jewelry and poop which will be another $1000 basically. I thought this was nuts! For context, the average salary in this country is only around $500 per month so this is a *lot* of money by local standards. Her family is quite well off though (parents are in their late 50s and both retired) so it's not like they need financial help I think. I already have to pay for the wedding 100% myself (it also tradition here for the groom to do that) where we have to invite her very large extended family as well as dozens and dozens of her parents' family friends, meaning our wedding will be around 300 guests. This all going to cost me so much, to the point that I worry I can barely afford it. Not only is this a lot of money, but it doesn't sit well with me that I basically have to pay a dowry for her. It feels like something from the 1800s and quite misogynistic. \n\nI've told my fiance all of this and now she's very upset with me. She says her parents are quite traditional and there's no way they will accept our marriage if I don't give the gifts. Supposedly, if I don't give the gifts, it'll look like I don't care about her and our marriage will have bad luck. Her sister (30F) is married already and I guess her husband (32M) gave the gifts at their wedding. My fiance has stopped answering my texts now, and I'm wondering AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify a couple things.\n\nI can afford it, but I'm a bit of a penny pincher, so it's a lot for me,  spending over $10k to get married makes me uncomfortable.

But it's also not something you have a lot of say in - it's your fiance's culture, not yours, and it's a tradition her and her family put a lot of stock in. That's not AH behavior either, especially when her parents typically see it as a means of protecting their daughter and her future.\n\nYou can refuse to pay, I likely would too in your shoes, but you can't expect the engagement to continue afterwards. Honestly though, that may be for the best. If something this culturally common blindsided you completely, you're in for a world of culture shocks in this relationship. That isn't necessarily bad, but if communication between you two breaks down this much every time it happens, it will not be a happy partnership.

Yes everyone would be shouting sexism. Please do not compare it to the dowry tradition, where the girl's family has to pay money (you check mate yourself). This tradition might have been justified as way of giving the bride her share of the family inheritance as in old times women could not inherit anything. Nowadays it is illegal e.g. in India as women CAN inherit now. Still it is being practiced and ruins the life of the girl's families. So the tradition had a well meant origin but is now being abused to extort money. Also, the dowry is now cause of a lot of injustice mainly to women and deemed to be sexist. So a law that is bad for the girl has been made illegal (the fact that it's still practiced is a completely different story). So why is now forcing the guy to pay the parents not a sexist thing? How is that not seen as extorting money as well? He has to prove that he's worthy and imo that is sexist as the girl doesn't have to prove anything and everyone seems to expect the guy to be the main provider.", "Or he could just find a less conservative spouse from any country. No matter what Asian country he is in the people there are definitely not monoliths. 100% there are women in that country who think bride prices are stupid and sexist.

A mutual friend doesn't think you need to spend more than $200 on a wedding, which is fine if he finds a woman who's on the same page. \n\nIf you look at the wedding subs, 50k doesn't pay for a giant wedding. It's not the church stuff that costs so much but the reception. Several years ago a friend at the local Cathedral told the deacon her son planned to get married there. He said the son needed to immediately join the parish, couldn't rely on his parents membership. Cost of having a wedding included a cantor, organist and wedding planner to be sure they knew the rules, to sit down and choose from the allowed music, etc. Non-parishioners the fee was $2500 but parishioners paid $,1000. Parishioners also could get married 6 mos later but others had to wait a year.\n\nThis is a Catholic church and a popular place for weddings but their first obligation is to the parish. It also includes use of the parish hall but most weddings were too big at the time so people went elsewhere. For parishioners it's a great deal.\n\nA young couple met there at summer jobs during college and were bumped to the head of the line.

It's quite common for the groom to move into the bride's parents' house.\n\nAlso, traditionally the wife takes charge of the new family's money. The mas kahwin is intended to be the bride's property - in the event of a divorce, she keeps it.\n\nI'm not sure why your interpretation of all this is that the bride can't take care of herself. Malay women were noted for being highly independent by European missionaries.\n\n(Assuming that the OP is referring to Malay culture, of course)", "I don\u2019t really see how any of that is evidence that the concept of buying your bride from her family isn\u2019t sexist. \n\nCertainly Malaysia isn\u2019t exactly on the forefront of gender equality, nor is Indonesia. Neither country even has a marital rape law, meaning that it\u2019s legal for a man to rape his wife because it\u2019s not actually considered rape.", "I'm saying that viewing it as buying a bride is simply inaccurate. No one in those countries regards it as buying a bride in the way that you're suggesting. I would know, my partner handed over jewellery as part of the engagement/marriage process, and it went to me. \n\nAnd since you've segue'd into talking about women's rights in Malaysia and Indonesia, fun fact - both countries have ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, while the US hasn't.\n\nBy the way, both countries do make marital rape a crime. It's phrased/enforced differently, but it is recognised as violence against women."]}
