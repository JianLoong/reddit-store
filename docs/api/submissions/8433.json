She told me that it's tradition for the groom to give a gift to bride's family, and at first I thought it was no big deal, but then when I found out more about I started to be against it. \n\nTypically the bride will ask her parents what is a suitable amount for the gift, which involves cash and gold I guess. They told her I should give $3000 in cash and then gold jewelry which will be another $1000 basically. I thought this was nuts! For context, the average salary in this country is only around $500 per month so this is a *lot* of money by local standards. Her family is quite well off though (parents are in their late 50s and both retired) so it's not like they need financial help I think. I already have to pay for the wedding 100% myself (it also tradition here for the groom to do that) where we have to invite her very large extended family as well as dozens and dozens of her parents' family friends, meaning our wedding will be around 300 guests. This all going to cost me so much, to the point that I worry I can barely afford it. Not only is this a lot of money, but it doesn't sit well with me that I basically have to pay a dowry for her. It feels like something from the 1800s and quite misogynistic. \n\nI've told my fiance all of this and now she's very upset with me. She says her parents are quite traditional and there's no way they will accept our marriage if I don't give the gifts. Supposedly, if I don't give the gifts, it'll look like I don't care about her and our marriage will have bad luck.

This isn't the last culture clash you're going to experience here, though. Each time something happens, your fianc\u00e9e is going to be torn between her culture and her love for you. It's going to take sacrifice on both sides. Love isn't enough here. She can't expect you to always fit into her worldview, and I think this is one of those occasions, but what culture will the kids be raised with?

What if you told them if would be extremely frowned upon in your culture to buy the bride from her parents, and traditionally the parents of the bride pay for the wedding? And that you value her so much that you want to provide a great life for her instead of bankrupting yourself for a wedding? Your married life will be about both your cultures, so the wedding shouldn't be just be about hers. I really don't know if there's grounds for compromise here, but maybe that's an angle that would better illustrate your POV.", "NAH. This is just a matter of different cultural expectations.

Your fianc\u00e9e can tell her family to back off if she is willing to stick up for you but based on the fact that she\u2019s ignoring your texts, it looks like she is okay with you being taken for a ride Be wary my friend.

To me, this sounds a bit like \"trading our daughter for monetary gain\".\n\nYes, I understand other cultures do dowries.  This is only my personal opinion.\n\nNow, as others have said, this should have been discussed at least before the engagement.\n\nI'm going to say YTA for not researching the customs you would be marrying into.", "NTA and if you do marry her, expect to have to support her family until they die. \n\nYou're an American cash cow for them, and honestly man, I'd run right now, and thank your lucky star that you're able to walk away now.", "I believe part of the logic is, if you can\u2019t afford the gifts what makes you think you can afford to be married?\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be a lot of money.
