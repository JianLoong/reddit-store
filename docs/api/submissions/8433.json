My wife was born and raised and has lived her whole live in this country, and things are a bit more old school here. She told me that it's tradition for the groom to give a gift to bride's family, and at first I thought it was no big deal, but then when I found out more about I started to be against it. \n\nTypically the bride will ask her parents what is a suitable amount for the gift, which involves cash and gold I guess. They told her I should give $3000 n cash and then gold jewelry and poop which will be another $1000 basically. I thought this was nuts! For context, the average salary in this country is only around $500 per month so this is a *lot* of money by local standards. Her family is quite well off though (parents are in their late 50s and both retired) so it's not like they need financial help I think. I already have to pay for the wedding 100% myself (it also tradition here for the groom to do that) where we have to invite her very large extended family as well as dozens and dozens of her parents' family friends, meaning our wedding will be around 300 guests. This all going to cost me so much, to the point that I worry I can barely afford it. Not only is this a lot of money, but it doesn't sit well with me that I basically have to pay a dowry for her. It feels like something from the 1800s and quite misogynistic. \n\nI've told my fiance all of this and now she's very upset with me. She says her parents are quite traditional and there's no way they will accept our marriage if I don't give the gifts. Supposedly, if I don't give the gifts, it'll look like I don't care about her and our marriage will have bad luck. Her sister (30F) is married already and I guess her husband (32M) gave the gifts at their wedding. My fiance has stopped answering my texts now, and I'm wondering AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify a couple things.\n\nI can afford it, but I'm a bit of a penny pincher, so it's a lot for me,  spending over $10k to get married makes me uncomfortable.

OP should also take that in consideration. Seems that he doesn't know his fiance and culture enough, and all this should be discussed before marriage. Being in love is nice, but marriage is much more than wedding, it's future that you ll share with person who grow up differently than you and has probably different views how family function and how to raise furniture kids. OP needs more knowledge and talk with fiance before he proceed with marriage.", "Yep, NTA to not want to do it, but OP, it very much **IS** a dowry/bride price and you most likely will **not** be getting married to this woman without it, because she doesn't want to be disowned and banished from her family.", "...so is no one going to mention that the family wanted $3k *and* poop? Poop of the groom? Lol DNA testing? *Clone creation*?!", "This right here.\n\nYou haven't elaborated on which country this is, but in certain asian countries, whilst it is the norm for the man to pay for the wedding, the man also gets to decide how many tables the bride's family receives for their guests. It would be good to do some research of your own, perhaps with local colleagues and friends to understand the norm in that country", "If that is the regular amount, no one would be married in that country.", "My partner is from a different country and we sorted it out ahead of marriage but even so some conflicts can happen. We learned not to assume the other would agree and to understand that our own traditions may not work for the other. OP, NTA. You should sit down and talk about traditions at length. What happens when you have kids and her family and maybe her want to do toxic or regressive stuff to them out of tradition?", "> This \"culture\" does some off as misogynistic. YOU have to pay her parents to marry her? YOU have to pay for the entire wedding to invite all her family's friends?\n\nI don't think this is uncommon. I had a friend who had her husband pay a few thousand to her parents to marry her. I guess that's common in Hmong culture. I think it's like showing that you have the money and are doing well enough to take care of their daughter", "To me, this is more NAH. While I don't agree with the tradition, per se, it *is* the norm in the country where OP is living. There are compromises in every relationship and it is up to you, as a couple, to decide what you are going to do.\n\nExpecting $3,000 when the average salary is $500 seems unreasonable, but I am not familiar enough with their culture to judge on that. I would say NTA if there was more evidence of them taking advantage of you as an American with a (presumably) higher salary.", "He was fine with the gift until he was told it would be $4K-$5K in cash and gifts. I think a relevant question is if the amount is normal locally, not just the tradition of gift giving to parents in a way that is functionally a dowry.", "Because non Western countries don't ever step out of their traditions? And these values can never be challenged?\n\nThey're a couple and it's a wedding for both of them, they should compromise.", "And just like in OP's country, people make up shit to get something for nothing. He needs to specify the country and let people from that country tell him if this is right? My daughter married someone from SE Asia and there was the gift thing but nothing as extravagant as OP's fiancee's family is expecting.", "> This isn\u2019t being treated like a marriage but a transaction\n\nThat's how weedings are in their culture though. This isn't a Western wedding like we're probably used to", "Yes. Which, at best, is completely against any idea of gender equality. And treats the woman as her parent's possession, not someone who can/should make her own choices.", "Toxic norms, customs and cultural practices change only when people refuse to follow them. \n\nOP is right. It is dowry and not everyone is comfortable buying a wife!\n\nNTA OP.", "Well said. I cannot disagree with your logic. There really is a lot of information missing. My concern was actually more about the specific family here and what they alone expect.", "I would say don't move to America and marry an American if you want to do the dowry thing, yes....\n\nI'm of indian descent, I live in Canada. I married a Korean so while I make ethnic food from time to time, we live according to NA values. \n\nDon't move somewhere, marry a person from that culture and say I, and I alone, get to pick and choose which of your customs are valid.  Live in Asia with another American woman if you want to live in, but not be \"of\" the country.", "This is the exact opposite of what a dowry is. Dowry is what the bride brings into the marriage from her family - money, jewellery, livestock, land, expensive cloth, furniture, household items etc.", "I totally get that. There are two cultures that are being represented here though. If they were both from the same culture that would be one thing. OP said his fianc\u00e9 has lived in this country her whole life. I will grant she could be having a culture shock of her own learning about western wedding culture and how different it is from her own.", "Not to be nitpicky but it is not dowry, it is bride price. Dowry is paid by the brides family to the grooms, bride price is the other way around.", "Can you explain to me the reasoning for the husband to pay for the whole wedding and pay 8 times the average monthly income to the wife\u2019s family? I would love to be more informed on this custom", "Oh now I get you. I think we have a misunderstanding here and are actually on the same side of this. What I meant is this: I don\u2019t argue pro dowry or any sort of payment, I meant both of them with the word dowry (is this word reserved for women only in English? Is there another word?) Language questions aside I am absolutely against such payments no matter who needs to pay. And I\u2019m glad to hear that India tries to abolish them.\n\nBut that\u2019s the meta level. On an individual level if I live in a country where such payments are expected from my gender then I can\u2019t expect to change the culture on a wimp. It sounds like in this specific culture the payment needs to be presented at the wedding. Not presenting it would likely have an extreme negative social impact. OP should be aware of this and try to come up with solutions (eg they both pay but he presents?). I would expect this kind of culture empathy from a long term partner living in the culture. This is independent from gender. Is it rooted in sexist tradition that should be abolished? Absolutely. But a gender swap of the story changes nothing.\n\nSo I actually think we are on the same page, right? My first response was a bit short and pissed because I just had it with people always claiming double standards no matter how baseless and can\u2019t argue their case. I wrongly thought you are one of them.", "I feel like bride price might be even stickier for people who grew up outside these traditions. At least a dowry was intended for the bride to bring something into the marriage to bring her some measure of security. Catherine of Aragon\u2019s dowry, for instance, included gold plate that she ended up selling off to to support her household after Henry VIII went full bastard.", "This is not true. This is a dowry. I'm Chinese and my very traditional Chinese friends parents expect a dowry for their daughter, and call it a dowry themselves.", "I've heard of this before and it's to assure the parents of the bride that the groom cares for the bride and her family, and can financially support the new couple and future children (possibly in-laws themselves in retirement) to the lifestyle the parents of the bride want for their child.\n\nIf someone wants to correct me, go for it, this is my understanding based on Reddit comments and the \"bad luck\" aspect the OP mentioned in the post.", "It's not my custom and I have no idea where in Asia op lives so why would I be able to explain this to you?? It's gf's custom and her reasoning is right in the post. \n\nI don't buy into it personally, but I have not chosen to move to gf's country so I don't have to.", "But people do have double standards everywhere. It sadly is that way and I don't know what culture you are from but here gender swap would induce a judgement in favor of a woman, it happens very often. E.g. women get away with wrongfully accusing men, a friend of mine always used the \"he is sexist to me\" to get her way and act innocent. The one she accused could not do the same, nobody would believe him because he is a guy. Also again in this case it seems to be fine for some people that a man has to prove he is worthy (and become possibly broke, while in-laws are not lacking wealth), but a woman does not.", "The full term is bride dowry, so it can still be called dowry. But by definition, it is not dowry in the traditional sense. For example, in India they use traditional dowry. What you have described is similar to Thailand and Indonesia where money is paid by the groom. The word is just the word, but the meaning behind it can be very different.", "I understand it's different everywhere. \n\nFrom my experience with my mix of very traditional Chinese to more modern Chinese friends and family, this is how they refer to it. The poster said Asia - which is vague, but it's good to learn how different cultures refer to it. \n\nMy Chinese family and friends call it a dowry regardless of gender."]}
