It's my second monitor from my job, and we are having a big meeting with our project funders. My partner also needs it. They have a big meeting with another dept. I basically said, tough luck, this is why you should have gotten a second monitor. They said, let's find a way to compromise. \n\nThey're right, of course, we should find better ways to compromise in the meantime. But long term? I think they should get their own second monitor.
