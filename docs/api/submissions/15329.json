My laptop doesn't have a camera, so I have to take meetings from that specific desk. But *they* also need the second monitor for *their* work. \n\nToday, we have overlapping meetings, and both want the desk. I said I need it. It's my second monitor from my job, and we are having a big meeting with our project funders. My partner also needs it. They have a big meeting with another dept. I basically said, tough luck, this is why you should have gotten a second monitor. They said, let's find a way to compromise. \n\nThey're right, of course, we should find better ways to compromise in the meantime. But long term? I think they should get their own second monitor. And today? My meeting takes precedence.

I'd rather get them a second so they can stop being so inefficient lol.", "Worse.\n\nOP's company paid for the equipment. It's not even OP's monitor, it belongs to their company.", "They want to know if they're TA, not a solution.", "why should OP need to do more when OPs partner has many opportunities for FREE office stuff and they don\u2019t use it?", ">INFO: Are they really, really going to know the difference if you're not using a second monitor?\n\nBut at the same time, does OP's partner really, really, need the desk for their meeting?", "This is what I latched onto. I definitely needed a 25 inch HD screen to look at excel", "Lazy AND entitled! The partner has essentially manufactured this scenario by not procuring the items they need to do their job. Then, instead of taking responsibility for that, is making it OPs problem to the point that OP is questioning if they are an AH for using their own equipment. \n\nAlso OP, a compromise?!! What is your partner even talking about? You don\u2019t have to compromise and share something you need when they have the ability to fix this situation that they created entirely themselves by buying a monitor that they don\u2019t even have to pay for. Your partner is not being a partner. They\u2019re being a huge jerk to you.", "Right! Seems OP made a point to leave gender out oc this. Commenters bias is showing", "Then you need to be on camera. Your partner needs to get that equipment.", "You\u2019re right. \n\n1) I was mostly thinking about the monitor situation, because the desk situation seems so solvable. You can sit anywhere, really.\n\n2) I really didn\u2019t soak in the fact that the partner is hybrid and could just go to work anyway.", "And OP's monitors were provided by *their* employer, meaning it may not even be okay for their partner to use one of them. If I let someone who wasn't employed at the same company use my equipment and my boss found out? I would be fired. OP should be very careful.", "My own monitor , My own Desk, My own keyboard, my own mouse and laptop stand. The list goes on but you get the idea.", "I bought my own keyboard and mouse at my last job becuese the ones we were given were so shitty I could only type about 1/3 as fast compared to at home with my mechanical keyboard.\n\nSo I bought a mechanical keyboard that had quiet switches and an extra mouse.", "NTA. And monitors aren\u2019t that expensive. I WFH and purchased a 28 inch curved monitor last fall for like $139 on Amazon (paid for myself). I had a 20 inch but wanted to make my life easier. Best thing I ever did. OP\u2019s partner is just lazy and entitled.", "And the partner is asking for compromise as a short term solution. The short term solution is buying a monitor. They could go to a shop now and buy one or online with next day delivery.", "Even worse, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s equipment. It\u2019s equipment that got provided by OP\u2019s company. To do their job. \n\nThere is no compromise.", "Oh yes, everything is fine. This is a very well managed thing. It doesn't really inconvenience me. It's more of a when we are out and about and my boyfriend doesn't realise how much liquid I need. He drinks very little compared to me, so he just doesn't understand how much more liquid than him I need. It's really a minor thing, because if he drinks my thing, I'll buy another one.", "I would like, after the judgement is decided, to learn the genders. I would bet $5 OP is a woman and Partner is a man. Not because women are great and men suck, but because the two genders are socialized differently. Women and girls are taught from a young age to prioritize the needs of others around them. Boys and men are socialized to expect their needs to be prioritized.", "We've seen how this sub is heavily gendered biased.\n\nA couple of months ago one story popped out where OP said they're F while the partner was M and most of the veredict was 'NTA'.\n\nThen it was discovered that the same story was posted a year ago with genders reversed and most votes were 'YTA' or 'ESH'.\n\nSo... Yeah. To keep this story as neutral as possible,  the no genders choice should be respected.", "And what kind of leverage does saying \"that's okay, my job is not that important. Use my monitor as you need it and even though I don't, I'll just suck it\" brings?", "Yea, the partner is just being lazy, between not going into work, not finding another spot, and not buying another monitor with the work funds. Oh well.", "Yep, and particularly if today not being able to use the equipment affects OP's performance in this important meeting. Work bought the equipment so that OP can do their job properly, they won't appreciate it if their equipment isn't used for that purpose", "I bought my own portable second monitor because they offered me a proper one, but I need to be able to put it away as I don't have a desk!", "My office provided us funds to home a monitor at home which I used but since than I've replaced that monitor for a bigger one and bought a second monitor for at my parents house- since my office let's me WFH in multiple locations.\n\nOP's partner is just lazy.", "My husband and I don't share a computer, a desk or even the same space when we are working. It would drive me bonkers to be interrupted with him while I am working. And he's the kind of person who always just wants attention for a minute.", "Boooo, hiss.  Not a fan of workplaces that don\u2019t give workers the tools they need.\n\nI said I didn\u2019t need a new monitor in our last equipment refresh because honestly I reeeeeally like my monitor.  Very happy with the size and all that jazz.  \n\nOur IT guy knew why I wasn\u2019t wanting to trade but my monitor is actually pretty old.  So he went ahead and got me a new one in the same size just a newer version despite it not being the monitor they were upgrading everyone else up to (they all had a different monitor than me, but theirs were all the same and the could request one or two - it\u2019s a long story).", "Or he could buy his own.", "It is funny because i thought OP was the man and the partner was the woman. I had to reread it to actually catch it was gender neutral.", "This is the stupidest comment ive seen today.", "Some people search for reasons to get mad", "That\u2019s wild! And weird.", "Same", "But why, when the post detailed that they both needed *OP's* monitor, did you suggest that OP should be the one to sacrifice? It's a no-brainer to me that if they both need to monitor but it belongs to OP's work OP gets the monitor. And that would be the case even if the partner hadn't caused the issue by not buying their own monitor.", "Hey I\u2019m not attacking you and I\u2019m sorry if other people are but that\u2019s a lot to put in me. \n\nI still think in this case that OP also has an important meeting so if you would care that your partner would miss their meeting your partner should care more that you would miss yours. Especially since it\u2019s your equipment. The partner is the AH for even thinking they should be and asking to be prioritized.", "People like to get sassy quick I've found lol"]}
