I work fully remotely, and my partner is hybrid. We have two desks, one with a monitor and one without.

They're \"perfectly content using mine\" when they're at home. \n\nBut here's the problem - I need the second monitor regularly. My laptop doesn't have a camera, so I have to take meetings from that specific desk. But *they* also need the second monitor for *their* work. \n\nToday, we have overlapping meetings, and both want the desk. I said I need it. It's my second monitor from my job, and we are having a big meeting with our project funders. My partner also needs it. They have a big meeting with another dept. I basically said, tough luck, this is why you should have gotten a second monitor. They said, let's find a way to compromise. \n\nThey're right, of course, we should find better ways to compromise in the meantime. But long term? I think they should get their own second monitor. And today? My meeting takes precedence. My boss and project partners expect me to be on camera using the office tech that they provided when I went remote. \n\nI know it's going to make my partner's life harder, and I do feel a little harsh.

Your partner has *failed to prioritize their own work for the last half year* and is being pissy because you\u2019re setting a boundary today.", "NTA.  If I understand this right - the equipment you are fighting over was provided by YOUR company.\n\nYou are absolutely right;  and depending on your company's IT policy, you may even be violating it by letting your partner use company equipment.  (if it's considered company equipment)", "NTA. Tell your partner to stop being lazy and get the second monitor that their job funds. Your second monitor is for **YOUR** job.", "NTA \n\nThe monitor is not yours, it belongs to the company which employs you and expects it to be used for you to do your job. \n\nBf is an adult who needs a lesson in personal responsibility. He chose not to obtain the necessary tools to do his job correctly. Not your problem. He fucked around and found out. Natural consequences are the best teachers. \n\nTell him he needs to order a monitor today. End of discussion.", "NTA\n\nThis is like someone saying, \"I'm not hungry, I'll have a bit of yours.\"  No - get your own meal.  I'll pay for it.", "NTA\n\nCompromise? How about your partner goes and gets a free monitor paid through work. It's extremely selfish for them to try to impact your job by not taking advantage of a golden opportunity to make both your lives easier. Your partner is choosing to make your work life harder due to their decision making.", "NTA\n\nYour equipment, you use it. What is the issue for your partner of getting their own stuff?", "NTA , your job provided you with the necessary equipment. He was given a budget to purchase the necessary equipment and whatever he did with those funds we have no clue but he made the decision he didn\u2019t need one , so let him figure out what to do today , maybe he should go to a local store and get one quickly", "NTA - your company has given you that monitor for that specific reason... therefore you get first priority to use it when you need it. They should have sorted their own out.", "NTA- It\u2019s your monitor that you were given for work. Your partner should absolutely get their own tech. The compromise is that your partner gets to use the second monitor when you don\u2019t need it.", "NTA and I wouldn't say that you prioritize your work. You use your appliances you got from your work and your partner should have done the same. Technically your partner is the ah to put you in this position.", "Nta. Your partner needs to buy themselves a service monitor.", "NTA\n\nYour partner has had months to get a monitor...months. If their day is harder because they don't have the monitor, that's on them. \n\nYour work paid for the equipment you are using, and it is their asset, not your partners. The compromise already happened; you've let them use it for months.\n\nTime for partner to take care of their technology that their company is funding. \n\nYou refer to it as a second monitor, it sounds like it would be a second for your partner. They have one at the office and company will get one for home. You are fully remote and have a laptop and one separate monitor.", "NTA but this should have been figured out as soon as they started using yours. You are always at home for work which mean you always need the monitor. Letting them borrow intermittently set this up to be an issue.", "NTA, I think it's good that you're willing to compromise but in this case it is just a bit of tough luck for the partner. Obviously it depends in the specifics of the situation but are you able to help them get on with ordering another one? \nSometimes people put off stuff like that for various reasons (I am one of those people, I really struggle with organising paperwork etc), so your mileage may vary, and i know its not really \"your problem\", but if its appropriate maybe sit down together and get it done to smooth things over and make it easier in the future", "NTA.  Monitors are not that expensive unless the buyer decides to get a really high end device and frankly, there isn\u2019t a need for one of those working from home a few days a week.", "NTA... Well you're slightly TA for bending over backwards in order to accommodate your lazy entitled partner.", "NTA \n\nSo let me get this clear, your partner wont buy their own monitor? And you're an asshole because you needed to use the ones you paid for?", "NTA - he should sort his own work environment out like and adult and accept that you get priority in your own space", "NTA - Your partner is just being a mix of lazy and busy.  But they are never going to get their own monitor if using yours remains an option, because that's more work for themselves.", "NTA the way to compromise is for them to run out & get a second monitor their company will pay for. Or since they are hybrid they can go into work for the day. Your desk is for you & you should not be sharing work space at all.", "NTA. Your partner had the opportunity to set up their work from home IT equipment but chose not to do so. You are now given no choice but to compromise on sharing yours.", "Well well well if it isn't the consequences of THEIR actions. It's you and your work's monitor. Your partner's negligence isn't your responsibility.\n\nedit: NTA", "NTA. No one's really the AH here in all honesty. It's just an inconvenience to your partner that they created themselves by not taking the opportunity to purchase their own equipment.", "So the monitor was provided by your work? Of course you get it! NTA. Especially since their work would provide one as well if they just bought it!", "NTA. \n\nThey made the choice not to get an extra monitor, you thought ahead. In a rush, sure, let\u2019s share it, but long term they should get theirs.", "NTA. This IS the compromise. If your partner doesn\u2019t get off their butt to purchase their own monitor, they have to cede to you when you need it. The monitor belongs to your company, not them. That they can use it at all is a favor (and one that I agree your company might not be too happy about.)", "NTA. The equipment is from your company. Your partner was given permission to buy equipment and get reimbursed. They haven't. That's on them. They've put it off and created this problem for themselves.", "NTA\n\nSure you could have put it more nicely but you are definetly right in essence.  \nThey had quite some time to get a second monitor to solve this before hand.\n\nI do get too that this is a rarer occurance where both need the same device, so maybe you two should see if you really need another monitor or if a low cost thing like a seperate camera, etc would already fix this issue for the future without having to spend much.", "Nta. Your company got you the monitor and the only reason this problem exists is your partners laziness. \n\nNext time he mentions compromise just reiterate the compromise is he can use as long as you don\u2019t need to.", "INFO: Are they really, really going to know the difference if you're not using a second monitor? \n\nIf not, then I'd say let your partner use the second monitor today on the condition that they request funding for their own monitor by tomorrow.", "This is a gentle example of fuck around and find out.\n\nHe's fucked around and put off doing what he needs to do in order to do his job from home: buy a monitor with company funds. All it costs him is a small amount of time to shop for and set up the monitor.\n\nNow he's finding out, because he doesn't have a way to do his job at home for this meeting because he can't take OP's work equipment to cover his own lack of proper preparation.\n\nYes OP, you put your job before his. Because it's yours and it's how you make a living and support yourself, and this is your equipment that you use to do that. He doesn't have a right to put his job above yours just because he's irresponsible. He doesn't get to take resources away from your company to use for the benefit of his company with no compensation to your company for that loss. With no warning! He doesn't get to make you shoulder the consequences of his inaction.\n\nNTA. Stop letting him use your monitor at all, because his only reason for needing it is pure laziness. And that's on him, not you. Once you stop letting him avoid the consequences of his laziness, guess what? He'll buy a monitor with company funds and it won't ever be a problem again!", "NTA but if he is such a cheapskate can he buy a camera you can attach to your laptop via usb? It is much cheaper than a monitor.", "NTA yoyr works equipment then its the priority. \n\nHe needs to actually buy his works equipment so this is not an issue", "ESH.  Monitors cost nearly nothing.   The fact that neither of you will actually solve the problem is telling.   It's about winning and being right.  I don't think either of you knows what the word partner means.  I'd bet that this is one of many petty disagreements that somehow never gets resolved.", "I'll go against the grain and say ESH, but definitely your partner a bit more than you.\n\nIt's been six months, this has probably been causing issues on and off and finally it's reared it's head in a severe manner. The best way to put this is: you need to learn to set boundaries a bit better, and they need to learn to respect your boundaries a bit better. It shouldn't have gone on this long and it takes two to tango.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your partner is being lazy as fuck and making it your problem. They can use the nice pool of funds they have and get a duplicate of your monitor delivered to your doorstep. There. Done.", "INFO: Who paid for the monitor you currently use?\n\nI'm already team NTA, but if your employer bought that monitor and manages it as their asset (as opposed to \"here's a bag of cash go buy yourself what you need\"), your partner shouldn't be using it at all. Those are then company assets that should _only_ be used for work for that company. Allowing your partner to use it for work would almost certainly be against policy. \n\nHonestly, if they have an allowance to buy equipment and they haven't, that's their own damn fault. You shouldn't be reducing your productivity (and let's be clear, you know that not using your monitor does do that) because they're too lazy to spend someone else's money to get equipment they need for their own job.", "NTA\n\nI'm also curious how your partner's employer would react if they find out that your partner cannot do their job as required because they didn't buy the necessary equipment with the money that was provided by the employer.", "~~INFO: who paid for the monitor you have?~~ Sorry I missed it the first time.

When OP DOES need it, OP's work takes precedence because OP's employer -- not partner, not partner's employer -- paid for it so OP could do the work OP's employer wants/needs OP to do.\n\nWhatever the reason for partner's procrastination, it is not a situation of OP's making.", "You\u2019re projecting, there is a solution to solve it and her partner is the reason it\u2019s unsolved", "ok then he should definetly get another monitor"]}
