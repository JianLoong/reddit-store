They're \"perfectly content using mine\" when they're at home. \n\nBut here's the problem - I need the second monitor regularly. My laptop doesn't have a camera, so I have to take meetings from that specific desk. But *they* also need the second monitor for *their* work. \n\nToday, we have overlapping meetings, and both want the desk. I said I need it. It's my second monitor from my job, and we are having a big meeting with our project funders. My partner also needs it. They have a big meeting with another dept. I basically said, tough luck, this is why you should have gotten a second monitor. They said, let's find a way to compromise. \n\nThey're right, of course, we should find better ways to compromise in the meantime. But long term? I think they should get their own second monitor. And today? My meeting takes precedence. My boss and project partners expect me to be on camera using the office tech that they provided when I went remote. \n\nI know it's going to make my partner's life harder, and I do feel a little harsh.

Allowing your partner to use it for work would almost certainly be against policy. \n\nHonestly, if they have an allowance to buy equipment and they haven't, that's their own damn fault.

I think, \"Oh, yeah, I'll do that later when I get home...\" or \"Damn I really should have done that last week, I will DEFINITELY do it this week when I do that other stuff I also have to do...  I will do it all together!  Then I will definitely get it done!\"\n\nOr I go to do it and the website with the best price has a \"Sign up for our e-mail list and get 15% off!\" so I sign up and wait for the coupon code, but it doesn't arrive for 4 days, and then I'm annoyed at them for making me wait and that creates a weird mental block that makes me want to avoid their website.  While simultaneously refusing to buy it from anywhere else because it will cost $6.32 more than if I use the coupon code from the website that is now annoying me...", "you don't know me or anything about me and your assumptions about me are very wrong again.  i said nothing about gender on my judgement, i replied to someone else who brought it up. honestly, you are not worth my time, so bye", "NTA - what's her problem getting the second monitor get it shipped over night", "Nta wth .. she needs to get her own monitor. Id be furious", "NTA!! hey OPs partner.....BUY YOURSELF A  FUCKING SCREEN!! the 2 monitors they have are used for THEIR job when needed. they aren't there to counteract your laziness in purchasing one. damn!! this is not complicated and should have never been an issue in the first place. OPs partner, you have the funding, use it and stop making your partners life more complicated. your work does not supersede his work. get on it!", "NTA. Your selfish partner doesn't get to jeopardize your job by not doing his when he is too lazy and entitled to supply himself with what he needs to work.", "Your partner has been irresponsible about his own work setup and needs to get his act together instead of mooching off yours. NTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s the monitor YOU bought, you BOTH need it and he can buy his own", "Why does your partner \"need\" it as well?  I've worked from home for 17 years.  I never \"need\" a second monitor.  Do I have one?  Yes.  I actually have two & remote into a 2nd laptop that I put on the 3rd monitor.  It's super convenient to spread things out & when I present & share my screen.  But I don't \"need\" any of them.  I can use my laptop screen just fine & I would guess that your partner can as well.", "I definitely read it as 2 men. No idea why.", "Absolutely this! I signed an agreement with my company that only I have access to the equipment they provided.", "you're very patient. if it was me it would be a big deal because you can never get settled at your desk properly, you're constantly disrupted and having to move around, it means you can never focus properly on your work. don't you think its important to have your own \"you\" workspace where you could like... not have clutter exactly... but put down a notebook or a pen and know that it belongs there?have a stack of post its you can stick on your monitor and know that it's just yours? or whatever you do to work? the organisation gives you a monitor to make your work life easier to do better work for them, not so that you are constantly disrupted in your work. idk i think you need to grow your ego a bit and stand up for your own space to be you and do what is important to you. just my 2c", "When small stuff like that bothers me, it\u2019s usually because I\u2019m already kinda done with the relationship lol. I guess you could call it the \u201ccan\u2019t you be less annoying??\u201d phase."]}
