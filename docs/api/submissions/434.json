Cat lover here. If your housemate does not like cats and doesn\u2019t want them around, you don\u2019t get a cat. The cat will constantly be trying to get out into the rest of the house and you probably won\u2019t enjoy having kitty litter in the washroom attached to your bedroom. It won\u2019t be the most pleasant experience for the cat and honestly, if you\u2019re not putting the cat\u2019s needs first, you\u2019re probably not a suitable cat owner.", "YTA \n\nYou can't lock a cat in a bedroom for its whole life. And it doesn't matter if you did because the hair will still be everywhere.", "Soft YTA he has a right to his desire not to have a cat. If he planned to move in and you had one before then he probably would have picked somewhere else. Just because the majority find it ok, you live with three others.\n\nIf you want to make decisions and have no one oppose it live alone.", "YWBTA. Absolutely. No question. First of all, just keeping a cat in your room is not cool for the cat. Cats need to be able to wander around. Second of all, bringing a pet into somebody's home without their consent is a very shitty thing to do. I know that you want the cat. I love animals as well. I have often wanted to rescue many of them. But I have resisted that desire until I was in a position when I felt that I could properly care for the animal and pay for the type of living situation that would allow me to only select situations with roommates that support the animal. You can't just bring a cat into a house where somebody doesn't want the cat. This sounds like a pretty immature question, I think if you were older you would look back on this and realize that it was ridiculous. It's one of those situations of You allowing your desires to cloud your judgment.", "YTA, if you live with other people everyone gets a say in whether or not there is a pet in your living space, one no means no pets. Not only would keeping it in your bedroom be cruel for the cat, hair and dander absolutely would get everywhere in the apartment.", "wait so you\u2019re planning to lock the cat in a small room?", "YTA. The cat shouldn't be confined to your room, and neither should your roommate be confined to their room. The cat and your roommate are fundamentally incompatible, and so your girlfriend needs to make alternate arrangements and find the cat a more suitable home.", "I'm a cat lover; I have 2. YTA to both the roommate and the cat.", "AITA, if you share space with people, you are bound to run into situations like that. Cat is a free animal and it will not stay in one room only. Unless you lock it up purposely but that will take a strain on it's mental health.\nAnd it's perfectly okay not to want a cat even with no allergies. So the thing, everyone agrees but one and he has no reason to decline coz cat will be locked up is bogus.", "Maybe you and GF should be looking for a small place together... \n\nYTA unfortunately... Poor kitty", "Yta \n1 for wanting to go against your room mates wants and 2 for wanting to confine an animal who needs to roam to a single room", "YTA I love cats when they live at other people's houses. I don't want hair on all my things and butthole on all my counters. If I had a roommate who brought a cat in, I would upset because it's my living space too.", "INFO:  Why isn't it allowed in said family friend's house, and why won't your girlfriend's family take the cat back, does it have behavioral issues?", "YTA. Your roommate made it very clear they are not comfortable with a cat in the house. The conversation should have ended there.\n\n>I tried explaining to him that the cat would be in my room and it would be as if there was no cat in the house.\n\nThat's an empty promise that doesn't mean anything. Your roommate would have to rely solely on your word that you will keep the cat in your room. And if it's one thing I know about roommates, there's no guarantee they keep their word.", "YTA. I\u2019m a cat lover. It\u2019s not something you can contain to your personal space.", "YTA. I'm not a animal person so I'll say no too.", "YTA and cats suck", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A couple of years ago, a family friend of hers essentially kidnapped the cat and kept it in their house.

First, for changing the living conditions on your roommates and kind of twisting your roomie\u2019s arm to get them to reluctantly agree to house a pet that they don\u2019t want. (They don\u2019t *need* an allergy to not want a certain pet. You can just \u201cnot like\u201d certain animals. Or like them plenty but not want them in your home. No justification necessary.) Second, because a kitty cat should not be locked into one room for its life. Cats need space to run and play and get the zoomies. They like comfy spots and some variety. Don\u2019t adopt this cat if you are going to lock it in a room. And you shouldn\u2019t adopt it anyway knowing one of your roommates is opposed.", "I love cats, I have 3. Adopting a pet is everyone Yes or 1 No. If one person doesn't want it, it won't happen.  \nOur cats are not allowed in our bedroom, but in the rest of the house. Believe me, they regularly sneak into our bedroom anyway. You can't keep a cat in (or out of) a room.  YTA.", "YTA I\u2019m a cat lover through and through but if your roommate doesn\u2019t agree then it\u2019s a no.", "YTA. So many things wrong here, all on you.", "NAH\n\nYou wanted the cat, and your roommate didn't, so the two of you talked about it, and decided on a plan. That's exactly what should happen.\n\nIf  your roommate decides that the cat shouldn't be there, then you have to honor that wish, unless you have some agreement within the household that it's a democracy, in which case, it sounds like you have the votes on your side.\n\nAs for keeping the cat in your bedroom, as others have said, it's not great, but if your options are that or taking the cat to a shelter, then I think your bedroom would be preferable. Please keep trying to find a better situation for the cat, though, because that's not ideal.", "Info: It sounds like you guys came to an agreement: to give it a try for a week. So you were wondering if you were the asshole for pushing him too hard to do that?", "Oh god yeah.\nMy cat has never been in my car there's still cat hair in my car though", "It\u2019s a very large room", "I am not sure why it is not allowed in the family friend\u2019s house. As for my girlfriend\u2019s house, the mom is a huge germaphobe. The cat does not have behavioural issues", "The situation just feels off", "That's not really humane. Having a pet in an apartment is an all in or no go. Even if confined to one room, your roommates are going to hear it jumping up on and knocking stuff over during 3am zoomies. Locked in one room the cat may your constantly. The smell of the litter box may escape your room. The cat WILL inevitably get out, likely more than once - especially if it learns to open the door on its own.\n\nYTA.", "Ok. I'm going NTA especially because you are thoughtfully considering whether you pushed too hard. Or whether it's off in some way. It's good to reflect on these things. So take in the cat for a week if you want. Keep it in your room like you said you would. If he doesn't object? Keep the cat. But if he does? Re-home the cat immediately or YWBT asshole.\n\nEdit: I am assuming your room is truly large enough to give the cat plenty of stimulation. And of course that you will find a good place for the litter box. \n\nI think it's fine to take the cat and for now keep him in your room. But next year I would make sure to have only roommates who like cats. So the cat can do the cat thing in the whole apartment. Having a pet is that type of commitment. I hope you're ready for it. Good luck!", "Thank you"]}
