By the time they found it, it had metastasized into neighboring organs and eventually into his spine. During the time when it was first discovered, MIL(58) was under extreme mental duress and would show up at our house, sometimes in the middle of the night crying. My wife (30) at the time was very pregnant and so, with her permission, I (29) would console MIL (hug, assure everything was going to be fine, etc).\n\nWe went on a vacation as an entire family, and what we thought was going to be a kind of quiet experience was more of a celebratory one. The treatment was working, the cancer had stopped progressing, and he was in better shape than he should have been.\n\nOn this vacation, however, my wife and I had a little extra time one morning and so we lounged out on the balcony of the suite we all had stayed in. To be perfectly frank, I had morning wood and was wearing tight shorts, so you can get the picture. MIL came out onto the balcony as we were stirring and I caught her staring at my crotch. We made eye contact and she looked away, and I greeted her quickly to make it not awkward. The moment passed and everything seemed okay.\n\nExcept ever since then, she makes a point of lingering in hugs and brushing her breasts against me when she asks to hold our child (which is every time I'm in the room with them). So, I tried to make a point of not being in the room with her when I'm with my child or coming up with an excuse to not pass them off.\n\nSo it all came to a head this past Thanksgiving when we met at their house. There was a moment when I was walking towards the kitchen and she came down the hallway towards me. The hallway is tight at their house and slowly moved past me with her rear poked out into my crotch. That was the last straw. I'd debated up until that point on telling my wife because everything until then felt as though it could be hearsay and MIL would just say it was all in my head. So the following week I sat my wife down and told her everything that'd happened from until Thanksgiving and she was furious. She agreed with me, though, that it could all just be a misunderstanding and wanted to see how MIL interacted with me in the next couple of weeks to see for herself if anything was off.\n\nShe watched and I could see in her eyes how much she was stewing inside when we brought our child over to their house and her mom immediately went to take them out of my arms and pressed herself against me in the process. I made eye contact with my wife and she blew up.\n\nLong story short, the family is pissed at *me* for \"starting\" it all and are calling me the a-hole because the family had finally gotten into a place of being at peace and FIL was doing better etc etc. I didn't think of it really in those terms, just how uncomfortable I felt with the situation and maybe I am. But I thought I'd post here and see what you all thought.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1670593487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgxq9x/aita_for_ruining_my_wife_and_mils_and_familys/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds like SO many sexual harassment stories I\u2019ve heard through the years. Im so sorry this happened. I\u2019m glad your wife backed you up, and that you felt safe enough to go to her with your concerns\u2014that can\u2019t have been easy. Your MIL is the only one who owes apologies. Yes, she may be embarrassed, and maybe she didn\u2019t mean it, but ultimately it\u2019s your feelings that matter here. She needs to give a real apology, and ensure she doesn\u2019t make you uncomfortable again. Until you\u2019re completely sure you\u2019re not going to be put in that situation again, you may need to limit contact, which is your right, and frankly any objections from your harasser is just more harassment.", "Jesus, your MIL has been browsing the popular feed on PH for too long.

You are definitely NTA!", "NTA. Can\u2019t believe I have to write this, but no, you don\u2019t need to get sexual abused by your MIL. Everything is on her.", "NTA. This is sexual harassment. You did nothing wrong. You didn't \"start\" anything, nor did you ruin your wife's relationship with her mom. Your MIL is fully responsible for that. This is not behavior you or anyone should be expected to put up with.", "NTA \n\nCommon theme on here that family decides you are TA for shattering the \u201ceverything\u2019s perfect\u201d illusion by telling the truth.\n\nUgh. \n\nThe only thing you could have done differently is to mention to her privately that she was making you uncomfortable as soon as you noticed.", "NTA. Your MIL is making physical contact with you that doesn't make you comfortable, and that's where it should end. MIL should be able to: \n\n1. Take your child from your arms without pressing her breasts against you.\n2. Hug without rubbing or grinding.\n3. Walk past you in a hallway without pressing her backside against your crotch. \n\nYou were correct to shut it down, because it made you uncomfortable. She's definitely not going to do it anymore now. So problem is solved. Don't apologize, because the next time she takes the baby from your arms, if she does it without brushing her boobs on you, then you can point out that you shouldn't have to apologize if all this time you could take my kid without making inappropriate contact with me.", "NTA! You didn\u2019t ruin anything, MIL did by being inappropriate. I know the titles here are meant to be clickbaity but let\u2019s be absolutely clear. MIL caused this and should be the one shamed by the family.", "NTA, and I think this was very well handled by you and your wife. You waited until you were sure, told your wife, who seemed to mostly believe you just wanted to be sure before reacting. This is the kind of situation where you want to be sure. \n\nYour FIL\u2019s situation is very unfortunate and I hope he recovers fully, but it doesn\u2019t excuse MIL\u2019s behavior whatsoever.", "INFO: When you say you the family had family gotten to a place a peace what do you mean? Like with your FIL\u2019s health? Also, why did it take you so long to tell your wife?", "NTA - MIL is committing sexual assault.  If she doesn't want the repercussions of sexually assaulting someone she could NOT ASSAULT SOMEONE. This is 100% her doing, not yours.", ">\tI might be the a-hole because I didn\u2019t consider FIL\u2019s health in revealing what MIL had been doing towards me.\n\nthis makes absolutely no sense. do you *actually* think this? why is this something you would have needed to consider? do you think someone dying would make it okay for a man to push his dick against a woman? \n\nlike come on. lmfao", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course not!", "NTA\u2026 your mil is the ah.", "Regardless of whatever past frustrations we've had with my wife's folks, they're still family. And we love them.

Additionally, I know that they would blame me for it.", "I probably should have clarified in the original post - my wife's folks (her dad more than anyone else, really) didn't like me at first because I'm black and they're white super conservatives. I didn't want to post it originally because I didn't want that to color anyone's perspective on them (and adding it made the post over 3k characters). So yes, they'd gotten to peace because of FIL's health but also because for the first time in the years that my wife and I have been together, everyone was getting along.  \n\n\nI didn't tell my wife because I wasn't sure if it was in my head or not and also because it was the holidays and we hadn't gone to my folks place yet. Probably selfish but I thought it was a good idea to not have that hanging over our heads when we visited my side of the family.", "Lots of people are hesitant to confront harassment like that. Because of the drama it stirs up.", "Please don't place that burden on yourself.", "That's some toxic thinking.\n\nStop it.  She has to be held accountable for her own behavior.

NTA!", "Oh, this makes it so much worse\u2014sexualizing Black men (and girls) is a form of racism that\u2019s incredibly toxic.

She didn\u2019t expect you to go to your wife or for your wife to back you up.\n\nYou are absolutely not selfish\u2014this was even more critical to bring up because if she\u2019s this racist/sexually inappropriate with a Black man, I\u2019m worried what she\u2019s going to do to your biracial daughter.", "Which you weren\u2019t TA to begin with, I realized I didn\u2019t say that in my info request.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour feelings are valid and you aren't at fault.

I get it, there\u2019s nothing you could do about morning wood but what I don\u2019t get is what made MIL think that reaction was for her. Where in her head did she get that idea? Has she always been eyeing you or did you leave something out?\n\nBased on what you explained, it feels like she was using you as someone to distract herself with sexually/romantically- whatever she was going for- because her husband was in bad shape and wasn\u2019t too sure which way the direction of his progress would be headed.
