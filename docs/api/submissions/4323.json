By the time they found it, it had metastasized into neighboring organs and eventually into his spine. During the time when it was first discovered, MIL(58) was under extreme mental duress and would show up at our house, sometimes in the middle of the night crying. My wife (30) at the time was very pregnant and so, with her permission, I (29) would console MIL (hug, assure everything was going to be fine, etc).\n\nWe went on a vacation as an entire family, and what we thought was going to be a kind of quiet experience was more of a celebratory one. The treatment was working, the cancer had stopped progressing, and he was in better shape than he should have been.\n\nOn this vacation, however, my wife and I had a little extra time one morning and so we lounged out on the balcony of the suite we all had stayed in. To be perfectly frank, I had morning wood and was wearing tight shorts, so you can get the picture. MIL came out onto the balcony as we were stirring and I caught her staring at my crotch. We made eye contact and she looked away, and I greeted her quickly to make it not awkward. The moment passed and everything seemed okay.\n\nExcept ever since then, she makes a point of lingering in hugs and brushing her breasts against me when she asks to hold our child (which is every time I'm in the room with them). So, I tried to make a point of not being in the room with her when I'm with my child or coming up with an excuse to not pass them off.\n\nSo it all came to a head this past Thanksgiving when we met at their house. There was a moment when I was walking towards the kitchen and she came down the hallway towards me. The hallway is tight at their house and slowly moved past me with her rear poked out into my crotch. That was the last straw. I'd debated up until that point on telling my wife because everything until then felt as though it could be hearsay and MIL would just say it was all in my head. So the following week I sat my wife down and told her everything that'd happened from until Thanksgiving and she was furious. She agreed with me, though, that it could all just be a misunderstanding and wanted to see how MIL interacted with me in the next couple of weeks to see for herself if anything was off.\n\nShe watched and I could see in her eyes how much she was stewing inside when we brought our child over to their house and her mom immediately went to take them out of my arms and pressed herself against me in the process. I made eye contact with my wife and she blew up.\n\nLong story short, the family is pissed at *me* for \"starting\" it all and are calling me the a-hole because the family had finally gotten into a place of being at peace and FIL was doing better etc etc. I didn't think of it really in those terms, just how uncomfortable I felt with the situation and maybe I am. But I thought I'd post here and see what you all thought.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1670593487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgxq9x/aita_for_ruining_my_wife_and_mils_and_familys/", "score": 696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're married to their daughter and your wife's nearly 60 year old mother is basically sexually harassing you. It's good that you brought this to your wife so she knows this is not something you like or want to happen. Your MIL must believe your morning wood had something to do with her or something? Idek, but that's just cursed as hell. Maybe just try to avoid her some more while your FIL is recovering? I agree that it's probably best not to stress him out. Someone in my family was basically in the same predicament with cancer as him and passed away barely a month or two after getting diagnosed with the advanced stage cancer, so it's fantastic that his treatment is working so well and it should be priority #1 right now to make sure he fully recovers. Hopefully your wife blowing up at her mother puts her behavior on halt for the foreseeable future. \n\nNot really sure what your MIL expects though? Like assuming she did think your morning wood was because of her why in god's name would she want to antagonize you? If anything she should want to protect her daughter from being cheated on.. but instead she seems to actively hope that you will cheat on your wife with HER, a 60 year old woman. I'm so sorry that you married someone you love and that left you stuck with whatever that mess of a MIL is.", "You being black makes this make a lot more sense. Sounds like after physical touch became normalised between you & MIL due to you consoling her during her husbands cancer, MIL saw your erection and assumed you were the racist stereotype of a hypersexual black male desperate to sleep with any white woman. Often its the people who claim to be highly conservative, morally upright, hate black people etc who are the ones most interested in racist race play. \n\n\nI would stay away from your in-laws for the forseeable future. Before you are falsely accused of SA and it's your word against theres. Also if your FIL has always disliked you due to your race, wouldn't not seeing you or your biracial child be the best thing for his recovery?", "Victims often blame themselves, it's insane how she thought sexual harassment was normal and the family is enabling it???", "That\u2019s very kind, thank you."]}
