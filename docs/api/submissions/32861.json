Mine are J 9f and M 7f, hers are H 9f and K 8m. \n\nWe have had very different styles in parenting. I was never harsh on my kids nor did I mistreat them. I had rules, routines and taught them disrespect from a young age, but that don\u2019t mean that I did not treat them with love. I have raised them to be the kids they are today and they are very well behaved, so great in school and have many friends, are polite and respectful. My sister had a completely different style when it came to parenting, she let them choose everything, it was always like they were in control of everything from the age they were around 2 years old. I never judged her for this, what worked for me and what I wanted to do was different from her choices, and that was fine by me.\n\nHowever, she always judged me, she would often tell me that my kids would grow up to hate me because I was strict. I never really cared because my kids always seemed to be fine by this. \n\nThe argument took place a couple of days ago while we were out for dinner with our parents to celebrate my mothers 70th birthday. While we were at the restaurant, her kids started demanding stuff, K threw a tantrum because the table next to us got their food before he got his. He was rude to the waitress and H told me \u201cno one really cares, you know?\u201d When I gave my mom a heartfelt speech about how much we all appreciated her and loved her. During the dinner, my kids behaved well, they were polite, had patience and well, behaved very good for being seated at a restaurant for that long. When we were leaving I told my kids that I appreciated them staying calm even though the food took a long time to come out (J has adhd and can often get a bit overwhelmed when she has not eaten). My sister heard this and told me that I did not need to brag about my kids in front of her to minimize her as a parent. I told her that I did not mean to do that and that I was sorry if she felt like I meant it in that way. She left and later texted me telling me that she was sorry, but that she gets overwhelmed with her kids and don\u2019t understand why her kids behave the way that they do. I texted her back saying that she could maybe try a different parenting style with more rules and with her being more in control then her kids, that maybe they will behave differently after a while. She responded telling me that I always do this, that I have always seen myself as the better mother between us two and that if I don\u2019t have anything nice to say about her or her kids and think that everything is her fault, then she will just stop talking to me altogether. I responded by telling her that I don\u2019t think of her as a lesser parent.\n\nShe has not talked with me since this and I am starting to feel like an AH because every kid is different and just because something worked for me does not mean that her parenting style is wrong.\n\nIf anyone needs more info I will provide in the comments because of character limit!", "created_utc": 1702347379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gb1u8/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_it_is_her_fault/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only are you actually the better parent, but you never claimed to be and were nothing but polite and respectful to your sister. She\u2019s bitter because she\u2019s seeing the results of both of your parenting styles and hers is clearly crap. Instead of owning up to this and trying a different approach she\u2019s being prideful and stubborn. She\u2019s lashing out at you unfairly. Let her stew. \n\nI really appreciate parents like you and loathe parents like her. Nobody wants to deal with unruly kids in public and we all appreciate well behaved kids like yours. So, thank you for doing your part in raising decent little humans. Keep up the good work and don\u2019t let your sister get you down.", "NTA.  Praising children is never a bad thing when they totally deserve it.  Sounds like your sister is jealous of you and tried to belittle you.", "NTA-She opened the door by saying she\u2019s not understanding why they behave like that. You made a suggestion that\u2019s all.", "NTA. You don't need to pretend to be a bad parent to make your sister happy.", "NTA, \nShe literally asked and you told her. She can be as mad as she wants that she doesn\u2019t like the answer. Honestly kids can be a lot in a restaurant at that age but being rude the wait staff is not a typical kid thing and she has some serious work to do.", "NTA -  Kids are tricky and people take things very personally. We don\u2019t see their day to day, and there could always be extraneous factors leading to a bad child, but how she reacted shows she has some culpability.", "I was a handful as a kid...high energy and unfocused. Then...I became an angel teenager. No back talk, no moods, no lying. Strange how these things pan out.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong but she was probably stressed and embarrassed and hearing what you said just compounded what she was already feeling. I would have waited until I was in the car to commend them, but that's me. I've been on both sides - my kid has acted like a jerk at times and like a saint at other times. C'est la vie.\n\nWe're all doing our best with whatever skillset we have...I don't agree with no discipline and I don't agree with too much discipline either. I took a balanced approach and am reaping the rewards after 5 years with a kid who is kind and polite but who also has a voice. I didn't want to raise an overly obedient kid or an entitled brat, either. We'll see how it goes.", "This post struck a very personal chord for me, and I agree with everything that ElaNinja has said.\n\nI parent like OP. My son is 12 and has autism and adhd. His mother 'parents' like OP's sister (we broke up before he was born, and he's in my care 4 days/week).\n\nShe also has another child, 15f from a previous relationship. She proudly says: \"I don't tell my children what to do, I just give them all the information and let them decide.\"\n\nThis 'philosophy' extends to things like covid vaccinations(!), whether they want to go to school or not, never having to say 'please' or 'thank you', etc. No consequences of any kind for bad behaviour either.\n\nHer daughter is 15 and cannot even tie her own shoelaces(!) because her parents have never taught her to do anything. She also hasn't been to school this year. I feel sorry for her, and her future.\n\nTheir mum just wants to coddle them, and never says 'no' to them, then peroidically loses the plot, and complains because her kids don't listen to her, or do anything she says.\n\nShe firmly believes that if she gives them everything they want all the time, why wouldn't they be happy?\n\nHer house is a crazytown circus most of the time. My son has punched holes in the walls, broken the tv by throwing the remote control at it in a rage when upset over something small and he even pulled a knife on her once - the list goes on.\n\nI have NONE of these issues at my house.\nI'm not a disciplinarian by any stretch of the imagination, but my rules are just consistent and reasonable, and problems get discussed calmly rather than rug-swept or turned into a screaming match.\n\nMy son and I have an excellent relationship.\nWe respect and love eachother, and are very close. He knows I'm always in his corner.\n\nLove without (mutual)\n respect is a fucking dangerous animal.\n\nLove coupled with respect is a beautiful thing.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing OP.\nThe results speak for themselves.\nSorry to say, your sister sounds absolutely clueless.\n\nNTA obviously.", "NTA", "She was embarrassed that her kids acted out of control and your didn\u2019t.  She mad that you praised your son for keeping it together while her didn\u2019t. She angry with herself not you", "NTA! The truth hurts and honestly I\u2019m waiting for my sister to go through the same thing. Her 5 almost 6 year old son runs her and multiple people have called her out on it just outta fear that he may actually hurt her when he gets older but she just cuts them out her life", "\"I'll admit we parent our kids differently, but I didn't say better.  You are the one saying that.  And me praising my kid in the moment for good behavior is not bragging.  It's... parenting\"", "NTA. Show her this post.  She needs to look at her situation for what it is.  She complained to you about her kid\u2019s behavior, what did she expect, a pity party?", "NTA. But when people complain about their kids, what they really want is for you to tell them their behavior is perfectly normal and they\u2019ll grow out of it.", "NTA.

Learn to validate instead of offering constructive feedback.  \u201c I understand that sometimes kids can be challenging, every child is different and these situations can be frustrating and you did your best in a challenging restaurant situation, apologies for exacerbating it, so how about those Vikings. \u201c.
