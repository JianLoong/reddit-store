Mine are J 9f and M 7f, hers are H 9f and K 8m. \n\nWe have had very different styles in parenting. I was never harsh on my kids nor did I mistreat them. I had rules, routines and taught them disrespect from a young age, but that don\u2019t mean that I did not treat them with love. I have raised them to be the kids they are today and they are very well behaved, so great in school and have many friends, are polite and respectful. My sister had a completely different style when it came to parenting, she let them choose everything, it was always like they were in control of everything from the age they were around 2 years old. I never judged her for this, what worked for me and what I wanted to do was different from her choices, and that was fine by me.\n\nHowever, she always judged me, she would often tell me that my kids would grow up to hate me because I was strict. I never really cared because my kids always seemed to be fine by this. \n\nThe argument took place a couple of days ago while we were out for dinner with our parents to celebrate my mothers 70th birthday. While we were at the restaurant, her kids started demanding stuff, K threw a tantrum because the table next to us got their food before he got his. He was rude to the waitress and H told me \u201cno one really cares, you know?\u201d When I gave my mom a heartfelt speech about how much we all appreciated her and loved her. During the dinner, my kids behaved well, they were polite, had patience and well, behaved very good for being seated at a restaurant for that long.

My sister heard this and told me that I did not need to brag about my kids in front of her to minimize her as a parent. I told her that I did not mean to do that and that I was sorry if she felt like I meant it in that way. She left and later texted me telling me that she was sorry, but that she gets overwhelmed with her kids and don\u2019t understand why her kids behave the way that they do. I texted her back saying that she could maybe try a different parenting style with more rules and with her being more in control then her kids, that maybe they will behave differently after a while.

I responded by telling her that I don\u2019t think of her as a lesser parent.\n\nShe has not talked with me since this and I am starting to feel like an AH because every kid is different and just because something worked for me does not mean that her parenting style is wrong.\n\nIf anyone needs more info I will provide in the comments because of character limit!", "created_utc": 1702347379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gb1u8/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_it_is_her_fault/", "score": 489, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needed to hear the truth while there\u2019s still time to turn things around.", "Even though you never claimed to be the better parent... your style of parenting has consistently been proven to work better than her style.  Like it or not, children do need rules and guidance, and allowing them to be in charge rarely turns out well.\n\nNTA for, whether you want to admit it or not, being the better parent.  Then again, your sister doesn't seem to actually want to parent her children, and the results are... well, pretty predictable.", "Your Sister \"Oh dear I have tried absolutely nothing, and I'm all out of ideas\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. My kid has ADHD and I always thank her for behaving well after doing something boring like waiting around at a restaurant full of adults. It\u2019s never a dig at the behaviour of the other kids. It is a genuine acknowledgment of my appreciation for her behaviour. These types of events can be boring and I believe strongly in rewarding good behaviour. \n\nYour sister did no favours for her children by raising them the way she did. She will have to live with the consequences of her own behaviour.", "NTA She lets her kids be rude and doesn\u2019t understand why they are rude? Is your sister unable to identify cause and effect?\n\nLike it or not your sister is failing her kids. She is telling them that hurtful and antisocial behaviour is ok. The real world will not be kind to them.", "Right? Projector sounds intensify.\n\nNTA", "Question: if her daughter hasn't attended school at ALL this year, how is your ex not legally facing consequences? Most states require written excuses and parents face jail time for truancy of their children after so many days.\n\nI'm genuinely curious, not trying to be rude.", "I truly hate the \u201clet them decide\u201d school of parenting. Kids CAN\u2019T decide because they don\u2019t know all the options! You must constantly introduce them to new things! \n\nAnd that helps them figure out how to behave when they don't like something new\u2014as well as when they DO like it.", "Is your kid in therapy? Being destabilized like that has to be really disruptive and upsetting, plus if he's showing rage like that over there, it suggests something is wrong besides a permissive mom.", "Thankyou for your response.\n\nIt's much appreciated.\n\nYou are absolutely correct about the 15y.o. struggling!  That poor kid is so emotionally dysregulated. She's never been taught how to cope with anything in life. Just today her grandma informed me 15f had called an ambulance to go to hospital because she was freaking out at home alone. That's the second ambulance trip in less than two weeks.\n\nShe really resents her mum now, and they fight all the time. She was two and a half when her mum and I got together, and she was fucking her up even then. Every single tantrum was rewarded in an effort to avoid dealing with the tantrum, which of course just ended up making them more frequent and intense.\nHer dad is a useless alcoholic sponger who hasn't parented a day in his life, so she has a double-whammy of crap parents to contend with.\n\nIt's an extremely sad situation.\nYet 15f mum still thinks she's a great parent...", "It's a great question. I'm not entirely sure why she hasn't faced any legal consequences; I've posed this question myself.\n15f may have been going to school at the start of the year (sporadically), but definitely not at all since July.\nShe goes to a school for kids with special needs (she has autism too) and they apparently allow the kids longer to graduate from high school, up until their early twenties, if need be, I think (?). Perhaps that means they're allowed long gaps in their education? I'm really not sure.\n \nHaving said that, she hardly went to primary school either.\n\nShe's a sensory-avoiding kid too, so doesn't deal well with crowds/noise etc, whereas my son is sensory-seeking, so their autism manifests quite differently.\n\nFortunately, my lad loves school!\nBut he still had to change schools at the start of this year due to behavioural issues. We're working on those, and professionals are involved.", "A distant relative used this approach. No meal times, no bedtimes, nothing. It was like having a group of feral cats around. Her philosophy was that all creatures know themselves best so she would be wrong to make any decisions for them. Of her four children two grew up fine, got out and don't see her anymore. Two remained feral. One is in prison and the other will never leave home.", "There\u2019s a proper way to do \u201clet them decide\u201d which is just giving them a little agency. Like \u201cyou need to clean yourself. Do you want to take a bath or a shower\u201d. X is going to happen, but the kid can decide how it happens. It gets the kid used to making decisions while also understanding some things have to happen.", "All children crave attention.  If you only give them attention when they mess up you reinforce the unwanted behavior.\n\nI always tried to remember to praise good behavior in the moment so I would see more of it.\n\nI was also told by my opinionated child \"you're not mean but you are bossy and have too many rules\" I suggested putting it on a t-shirt.\n\nHe's in college now so I think we both survived just fine with my rules.", "Oof, this poor girl. I completely blame the parents on this situation. She\u2019s been taught bad behaviors and they\u2019re going to be difficult for her to unlearn as she gets older. Sadly, lazy parenting hurts the kids more than anyone else.", "Oh man, I really feel for her!! I wish her all the best, but that makes much more sense. I hope she does well in her future!!\n\nAnd best wishes for your son. I'm sending positive vibes your way!\n\n\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "lol I think that\u2019d make a fun t-shirt"]}
