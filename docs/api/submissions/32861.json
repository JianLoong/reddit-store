Mine are J 9f and M 7f, hers are H 9f and K 8m. \n\nWe have had very different styles in parenting. I was never harsh on my kids nor did I mistreat them. I had rules, routines and taught them disrespect from a young age, but that don\u2019t mean that I did not treat them with love. I have raised them to be the kids they are today and they are very well behaved, so great in school and have many friends, are polite and respectful. My sister had a completely different style when it came to parenting, she let them choose everything, it was always like they were in control of everything from the age they were around 2 years old. I never judged her for this, what worked for me and what I wanted to do was different from her choices, and that was fine by me.\n\nHowever, she always judged me, she would often tell me that my kids would grow up to hate me because I was strict. I never really cared because my kids always seemed to be fine by this. \n\nThe argument took place a couple of days ago while we were out for dinner with our parents to celebrate my mothers 70th birthday. While we were at the restaurant, her kids started demanding stuff, K threw a tantrum because the table next to us got their food before he got his. He was rude to the waitress and H told me \u201cno one really cares, you know?\u201d When I gave my mom a heartfelt speech about how much we all appreciated her and loved her. During the dinner, my kids behaved well, they were polite, had patience and well, behaved very good for being seated at a restaurant for that long. When we were leaving I told my kids that I appreciated them staying calm even though the food took a long time to come out (J has adhd and can often get a bit overwhelmed when she has not eaten). My sister heard this and told me that I did not need to brag about my kids in front of her to minimize her as a parent. I told her that I did not mean to do that and that I was sorry if she felt like I meant it in that way. She left and later texted me telling me that she was sorry, but that she gets overwhelmed with her kids and don\u2019t understand why her kids behave the way that they do. I texted her back saying that she could maybe try a different parenting style with more rules and with her being more in control then her kids, that maybe they will behave differently after a while. She responded telling me that I always do this, that I have always seen myself as the better mother between us two and that if I don\u2019t have anything nice to say about her or her kids and think that everything is her fault, then she will just stop talking to me altogether. I responded by telling her that I don\u2019t think of her as a lesser parent.\n\nShe has not talked with me since this and I am starting to feel like an AH because every kid is different and just because something worked for me does not mean that her parenting style is wrong.\n\nIf anyone needs more info I will provide in the comments because of character limit!", "created_utc": 1702347379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gb1u8/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_it_is_her_fault/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My son has punched holes in the walls, broken the tv by throwing the remote control at it in a rage when upset over something small and he even pulled a knife on her once - the list goes on.\n\nI have NONE of these issues at my house.\nI'm not a disciplinarian by any stretch of the imagination, but my rules are just consistent and reasonable, and problems get discussed calmly rather than rug-swept or turned into a screaming match.\n\nMy son and I have an excellent relationship.\nWe respect and love eachother, and are very close.

That poor girl is going to struggle in life and most of it could have been avoided by proper parenting.\n\nIt\u2019s a well known and documented fact that children need and thrive in a structured environment.

You\u2019re advocating lying to an adult and encouraging piss poor parenting. Adults like you are why adults like OP\u2019s sister never even try to change.

It was a great teaching moment. The fact that sister took it poorly shows she isn\u2019t handling these situations well and needed a reality check.\n\nExcusing poor manners as \u201chonesty\u201d is BS and only perpetuates the problem. Throwing tantrums because of impatience and boredom isn\u2019t \u201chonesty\u201d. I was a child with ADHD and was taught this was poor manners and unacceptable behavior, especially out in public. Guess what, I learned how to behave! Wow, the system works! Sister\u2019s system doesn\u2019t.", "Yeah, it sounds like sister was fishing for support and encouragement, but got smacked with the truth instead. The smack was gentle and yet she still recoiled which shows she is too proud to take any constructive criticism at this time. Changing the subject from now on would probably be easier.", "Uh, no. I was just curious as to whether there was another adult in the household and if they were on the same page, that's all. Sometimes parents have opposing opinions on childrearing issues, but one person is more \"dominant\" than the other, one parent spends more time hands on with the kids, etc. \n\nIt was simply a question I had, in order to get a little more info on the situation. Please refrain from making inaccurate random assumptions about my \"intentions\" in asking. The questions were not directed at you.", "Exactly. Do not validate the kid when they insult someone. You\u2019re rewarding bad behavior and ensuring it will continue."]}
