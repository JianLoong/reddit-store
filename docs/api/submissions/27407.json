I wasn\u2019t homeschooled but I have friends who were and friends who homeschooled their kids they all turned out great. All of them are people for whom public school wasn\u2019t challenging enough. \n\nThere are tons of programs for homeschooled kids to learn about things with other homeschooled kids, tons of sport and activity programs, etc. Many homeschool families pool resources now and a parent that works in a STEM field will teach the subject they\u2019re skilled in. The one with a job as a writer teaches English or literature, etc. One friend that has a pottery business and paints teaches art. \n\nYes, there are families that homeschool that shouldn\u2019t, and there are people that we homeschooled whose education is sorely lacking, but that doesn\u2019t make all homeschooling bad. There are also many, many forms of child abuse that count as the worst thing you could do to a child. \n\nI would say child abuse is a worse thing.", "I homeschooled my kid for a couple of years and she's just fine.  She did all sorts of extracurricular stuff: theatre, horseback riding lessons, dance, voice, strings orchestra...she's back in the building this year and is right on par socially with her peers.  Also, she never did a single religious lesson.

Their oldest is a senior in college. He attends a large public school, plays club sports, and is very socially active and engaged. His second oldest is in the military and also super social. His middle is the least social but still does sports and is involved in their church. His youngest two are in their early teens and always are hanging out with friends. My kids went to public school. My son is extremely social and active in a shit ton of sports and activities but my daughter was always socially awkward. She's in college now and doing well but she is quirky as hell and is glad to be at a school with a bunch of nerdy kids because they are all pretty socially awkward. None of them were homeschooled. \n\nI think a lot of homeschooling parents screw up but it is super unfair to call it the worst thing you can do to a child. My homeschooled nephews are all doing great and are not at all removed from their community. There are some parents who outright abuse their kids, so let's pump the breaks a bit.", "I think in the last 30 years since I was in school in the 80s/90s the homeschooling situation must have really exploded because it sounds like there are LOTS of kids being homeschooled these days. \n\nWhen I was a kid it was only the Jesus freak families or really sick kids - honestly nobody knew homeschooled kids, it was really rare.", "A lot of homeschool meetup groups are horrible. Maybe most.\n\nOften you've a choice between nutty fundamentalist parents or asshole crunchy hippie parents, pick one. The activities are not great. \n\nThe kids are a mixed bunch, of course, but there's lots of poorly supported neurodivergence even in the better cases of parents not ignoring whole subjects or basic life skills and have the Dunning-Kruger effect under some control.\n\nSocial outlets and activities should be largely with kids who go to various schools, not just other self-selecting compatible homeschool families.", "In a similar vein I'm sure one could say terrible things about boarding schools yet some children/families have found them wonderful and fantastic while I'm sure terrible stories of neglect exist too. \n\nLife is a rich tapestry...", "Exactly. As with anything else, you get out what you put in.  If the parents just aren't great teachers and also equate homeschooling to just having the kid hang around the house, then yes big fail.\n\nThose who actually follow through like in this case, it's just another avenue to success. \n\nUnfortunately too many just use it as an easy way out."]}
