If you take your sister, SHE doesn't have to make plans.", "NTA - Your mother is doing your sister a serious disservice. She is convincing your sister that she is entitled to be included in everything you do, so of course your sister feels hurt and excluded when she isn't. \n\nIt is your mother's job as a parent to help your sister understand that it is normal and ok for you to do things with just your husband and child and that it is not because you don't care about her or like spending time with her.", "NTA.

This is not healthy for a teen, and it probably doesn't help that she's home schooled.  (Nothing wrong with home schooling, but if it negatively impacts peer socialization, this needs to be fixed asap). \n\nTell mom to get busy.", "NTA\n\nIt's very reasonable to say No sorry we are busy, but you can come over later.", "NTA. You need to spend some time with just your family.  That is totally normal.", "NTA -\n\n> I don\u2019t think I should be expected to invite her to everything that I do.\n\nYou already answered your own question. It's definitely an unreasonable expectation from your mother.

Because that is what you are doing for YOUR Child.", "I'm not shocked that the mom who is homeschooling her daughter with no friends is overbearing.  If you homeschool it is on you to find enough social outlets for your kid - and forcing your older daughter to be a replacement for that outlet is not appropriate.  This poor kid needs more chances to meet kids her own age.", "Plus if she doesn\u2019t have friends and is homeschooled then your mother needs to find something for your sister to get involved in to meet people her age.  If she goes away to college then she might have problems with peer interaction.", "I'm wondering if her mother isn't having trouble understanding herself that \"her baby\" is now building her own nest, and still feels like she should be in full service to her birth nest...to abuse a metaphor.\n\nBut yes, OP should absolutely have regular low stakes time and activities with just her husband and daughter, and even just with her daughter alone, I'm wondering if her aunt is getting a disproportionate amount of time that could be going to the little girl.", "I agree with this so much.  My cousin homeschools her kids and has them involved in gymnastics, science club for her oldest, soccer, and all sorts of things.  There are also homeschooled groups that have meetings for the kids to socialize, go hiking, and all sort of other things.  Mom needs to check these out.\n\nAnd NTA.

You are stunting their personal growth and removing them from the community.

The previous commenter is right, you need to make sure you find enough social outlets and activities if homeschooling. There's usually a lot of meet up groups and such for families in an area who are homeschooling.", "Most of the homeschoolers I know are constantly doing extra curriculars and social activities. I suspect you just don't realize that you're surrounded by successful homeschoolers because they blend in. Only the awkward ones jump out at you. Guess what? You can end up socially awkward by going to a public school, as well.", "That's not true; homeschooling kids aren't typically isolated like this.", "Spoken by someone who has no idea. I planned several activities for my homeschooled kids.. No not just church... It's up to the parents to do this. And I assure you that I'm not shitty and all my kids, now adults, don't think I am either. They are now homeschooling my 5 grandkids... And they aren't religious!", "This is completely untrue.", "True  but she would be an adult and wouldn't need their permission"]}
