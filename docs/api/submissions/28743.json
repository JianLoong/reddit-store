One of my professors makes his office hours more interactive by having one student write on the board as we collectively work on a homework problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn one particular day, I was at office hours, sitting toward the front of the room(near the board). One of my classmates, \"Anne\"(who I'm not close with), was sitting in the back of the room, and she was called to be the person to write on the board. I had the pdf of the homework sheet pulled up on my laptop and was looking at it while writing some notes. Since Anne left her laptop at the back of the room, she just takes my laptop from me without asking and starts using it. I'll admit, I felt mildly annoyed and disrespected. First of all, she just took my laptop without saying a word to me. I'm happy to help people and wouldn't have minded her using it, but it's common decency to ask people before using their stuff. I mean I would ask someone before touching their laptop, especially if I don't know them well. Second of all, I was clearly using the laptop and writing notes on a different question, and she just turns it away from me and scrolls to a different question, which I felt was a little disrespectful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, despite being a little annoyed, I was going to let it slide. After all, it's not the biggest of problems. My good friend \"Laura\", who was sitting next to me, kind of picked up on my annoyance though. As Anne was talking to the professor(still holding my laptop), Laura kind of laughs and whispers to me \"she just took your laptop bro\". I whispered back \"I know, and she didn't even ask!\" Laura nodded and said \"I know!\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe didn't think Anne would hear us talking about her as she was speaking to the professor. However, turns out she did overhear our conversation, and got really offended. I found out through \"Jane\", who is a mutual friend of Anne and I. She was complaining about how apparently I was rude to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I don't think I did anything wrong. We didn't say anything rude/insulting toward Anne, just that she took my laptop without my permission. And in all fairness, it was kind of impolite of Anne to take my laptop without asking me. Now, I understand that no one is perfect, including myself. There have been times where I slipped up and forgot my manners. If I was in Anne's shoes, and someone called me out, I would also feel uncomfortable, but then I would apologize to them, or at the very least make sure I don't do the same thing again. Anne is making me out to be this rude person, when she's the one who snatched my laptop while I was using it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLaura is on my side and Jane is on Anne's side. So I wanted other's opinions.

You underreacted.", "NTA.  So she walks by you and steals your laptop and no one did anything about it. I would\u2019ve gone after her and demanded it back since she didn\u2019t ask. What was the professor doing while your property was being stolen in their class?", "NTA\n\nWhat on earth is Anne's problem? You don't touch someone else's stuff without their consent. You especially don't pick up someone else's computer and just start using it.", "NTA.\n\nYou were excessively polite about it. In your position I would have been very loud about her rudeness and blatant theft.\n\nJust a clear, \"Hey! Don't touch my laptop. What the hell is wrong with you?\"\n\nBecause what the hell is wrong with her? She shouldn't touch your laptop.", "You are NTA. Not only you didn't do anything wrong, you displayed an enormous tolerance for Anne's very obvious rudeness. It is very common for rude people to take offense and accuse others of being rude when their lack of manners is noted. You will run into it again and again in life. Don't let it confuse you. Anne was stunningly rude. You and Laura were not, by commenting on her rudeness. I mean, Miss Manners would probably go on a rant about how it is rude to call out rude people, but this is not a Miss Manners column, this is real life, and rude people need to know that people notice.", "NTA\n\nWho does that?! I wouldn't have let it go either. That is an expensive piece of equipment. What if she had dropped it. You should've called her out right then and said excuse me but I did not give you permission to use that. Hand it back. She owes you an apology and she should never do something like that again.", "NTA. She could have gone and gotten her own laptop to use. That was just lazy of her. And I wouldn't want anyone else carrying my open laptop around. You just know that's the time they're going to lose their grip.", "NTA. Anne SNATCHED YOUR PERSONAL LAPTOP without permission or even asking, while you were taking notes, when she had HER laptop at her desk, and took it without permission in front of the entire class. And when you comment on it, not even insulting her, just stating facts of what she just did, she has THE NERVE to get offended at YOU, instead of offering an apology? This girl is incredibly entitled.", "Wow. I would have taken MY laptop back and said inappropriate things to her about touching expensive property that was NOT hers! Anne is TA. \n\nYOU, NTA", "NTA\n\nAnne is a presumptuous piece of work", "Nta.    Yeah no, no one touches my computer, laptop, tablet or phone. Without having my explicit permission.  Anne's actions were unacceptable.", "\"Whoa there, sparky. I'm still using that.\"  \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Jane isn\u2019t a good friend if she can support someone who is clearly in the wrong.", "NTA - Entitled people like Anne always think that everyone else are the problem.", "NTA\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t she bring her laptop with her and bring it to the front of the class like someone normally would??? How bizarre for her to not only snatch your laptop but even the professor didn\u2019t say anything?", "NTA but why didn't you say anything? she took your laptop without asking, that's so ridiculous. I would've been furious!!", "ESH. Stop talking through people. Ask the girl who took your lap top, why she thought that would be ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
