One of my professors makes his office hours more interactive by having one student write on the board as we collectively work on a homework problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn one particular day, I was at office hours, sitting toward the front of the room(near the board). One of my classmates, \"Anne\"(who I'm not close with), was sitting in the back of the room, and she was called to be the person to write on the board. I had the pdf of the homework sheet pulled up on my laptop and was looking at it while writing some notes. Since Anne left her laptop at the back of the room, she just takes my laptop from me without asking and starts using it. I'll admit, I felt mildly annoyed and disrespected. First of all, she just took my laptop without saying a word to me. I'm happy to help people and wouldn't have minded her using it, but it's common decency to ask people before using their stuff. I mean I would ask someone before touching their laptop, especially if I don't know them well. Second of all, I was clearly using the laptop and writing notes on a different question, and she just turns it away from me and scrolls to a different question, which I felt was a little disrespectful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, despite being a little annoyed, I was going to let it slide. After all, it's not the biggest of problems. My good friend \"Laura\", who was sitting next to me, kind of picked up on my annoyance though. As Anne was talking to the professor(still holding my laptop), Laura kind of laughs and whispers to me \"she just took your laptop bro\". I whispered back \"I know, and she didn't even ask!\" Laura nodded and said \"I know!\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe didn't think Anne would hear us talking about her as she was speaking to the professor. However, turns out she did overhear our conversation, and got really offended. I found out through \"Jane\", who is a mutual friend of Anne and I. She was complaining about how apparently I was rude to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I don't think I did anything wrong. We didn't say anything rude/insulting toward Anne, just that she took my laptop without my permission. And in all fairness, it was kind of impolite of Anne to take my laptop without asking me. Now, I understand that no one is perfect, including myself. There have been times where I slipped up and forgot my manners. If I was in Anne's shoes, and someone called me out, I would also feel uncomfortable, but then I would apologize to them, or at the very least make sure I don't do the same thing again. Anne is making me out to be this rude person, when she's the one who snatched my laptop while I was using it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLaura is on my side and Jane is on Anne's side. So I wanted other's opinions.

What was the professor doing while your property was being stolen in their class?", "NTA\n\nWhat on earth is Anne's problem? You don't touch someone else's stuff without their consent. You especially don't pick up someone else's computer and just start using it.", "NTA.\n\nYou were excessively polite about it. In your position I would have been very loud about her rudeness and blatant theft.\n\nJust a clear, \"Hey! Don't touch my laptop. What the hell is wrong with you?\"\n\nBecause what the hell is wrong with her? She shouldn't touch your laptop.", "You are NTA. Not only you didn't do anything wrong, you displayed an enormous tolerance for Anne's very obvious rudeness. It is very common for rude people to take offense and accuse others of being rude when their lack of manners is noted. You will run into it again and again in life. Don't let it confuse you. Anne was stunningly rude. You and Laura were not, by commenting on her rudeness. I mean, Miss Manners would probably go on a rant about how it is rude to call out rude people, but this is not a Miss Manners column, this is real life, and rude people need to know that people notice.", "NTA\n\nWho does that?! I wouldn't have let it go either. That is an expensive piece of equipment. What if she had dropped it. You should've called her out right then and said excuse me but I did not give you permission to use that. Hand it back. She owes you an apology and she should never do something like that again.", "NTA. She could have gone and gotten her own laptop to use. That was just lazy of her. And I wouldn't want anyone else carrying my open laptop around. You just know that's the time they're going to lose their grip.", "NTA. Anne SNATCHED YOUR PERSONAL LAPTOP without permission or even asking, while you were taking notes, when she had HER laptop at her desk, and took it without permission in front of the entire class. And when you comment on it, not even insulting her, just stating facts of what she just did, she has THE NERVE to get offended at YOU, instead of offering an apology? This girl is incredibly entitled.", "Wow. I would have taken MY laptop back and said inappropriate things to her about touching expensive property that was NOT hers! Anne is TA. \n\nYOU, NTA", "NTA\n\nAnne is a presumptuous piece of work", "Nta.    Yeah no, no one touches my computer, laptop, tablet or phone. Without having my explicit permission.

How bizarre for her to not only snatch your laptop but even the professor didn\u2019t say anything?", "NTA but why didn't you say anything? she took your laptop without asking, that's so ridiculous.

Give that back. Go use your own laptop.\"\n\nSeriously, who grabs someone else's laptop without asking?\n\nThis is the kind of etiquette you learn in kindergarten - don't take other people's stuff without permission.", "haha well she wasn't stealing it, the professor asked her to solve a homework problem and she saw that I had the hw pdf pulled out. So she snatched it to look at it while I was using it. But yeah I think she should have at least asked.", "This is what I was thinking! But people say I overreact. I'm glad to see people thinking the same thing as me. Laptops are fucking expensive, why would you touch someone else's without asking them lol", "I wish I could have done this, but there was a classroom of students and we have mutual friends who would be on my ass about being rude to her", "You did not overreact, I would have flipped out if someone just snatched my laptop or my phone without permission. I don't even let my mom to do that with me, but a classmate? I would have snatched the laptop back. I mean, it's not just expensive, it's personal! It has important and private information, I don't want anyone else to take it unless I am asked first.\n\nI'm all for sharing and offering help my friends and classmates as long as they ask permission first, but she didn't, heck, you were using it and she just snatched it away, and had the nerve to get offended at you when she was the offender!", "And you could point out that you were still far less rude than she was, since she *took your laptop without permission*.\n\nThe other option would be calling the police to report a theft.", "If I\u2019d been you I would have gone to the back of the class, snatched her laptop and shoved it at her while securing my own back from her. How rude!", "NTA, you were literally using your lap top and she didn\u2019t ask to borrow it.", "The only rude person is the one who snatched someone else\u2019s laptop without asking.

They always have the audacity to be offended when you call them on their bullshit.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but this sounds like a weird Joey dream scenario. The little problems are always fun.\n\nWhy don't you all kiss and sort this out quickly. Always wanting to drag it on. Ah, women.\n\nSeriously though just talk to Anne directly and let her know.", "YTA - you're 21, and old enough to just ask for it back, say no, or \"I'm using that\". What you did was pretty immature. However, who cares if Anne is upset? She should have more manners.", "NTA. That\u2019s highly inappropriate to grab your laptop like that. She could have asked you if you\u2019d share it for a moment while she was presenting on the board. Even then, I would have expected her to turn it to face her, not pick it up and carry it off. I think you were too nice about it \u2014 I would have called her out \u201cexcuse me, where are you going with my laptop!\u201d as soon as she picked it up.

I was 50 years old before I learned how to stand up for myself against rude or entitled people, don\u2019t wait that long.", "NTA. Will she replace your laptop if she drops it? I doubt it. It probably wouldn't have been wise to allow to use it even if she asked, a laptop is too heavy to wave around when you're also writing on the board. But she didn't even ask. Major ah. \n\nBut the main ah here is the teacher. What do they expect, that students remember all problems by heart? You invite someone to the board, you hand them a printout.", "NTA.  Taking your laptop away from you, scrolling to another place, and using your laptop for her own ends... then retaining possession of it while she spoke to the professor was a touch... entitled... as is the idea that you are somehow being \"rude\" by commenting with your friend that she just took your laptop.  Her discomfort with having her poor behavior commented on is not your problem... or your transgression.", "It\u2019s not rude to politely communicate your preferences for your own belongings. In fact, doing anything less is acting like a doormat. \u201cExcuse me, can you please return my laptop? If you\u2019d like to look at it, please ask first and leave it on my desk\u201d. That\u2019s like the *minimum* for showing self respect.", "Taking without asking is stealing", ">So she snatched it to look\n\nThat's literally stealing.", "You underreacted. I\u2019ve been in this situation multiple times before while in school. The etiquette is to ask to look on the screen or if the computer owner can read them the problem aloud so they can copy it on the board. Also she shouldn\u2019t pick up your laptop .. you turn it and leave it on the owner\u2019s desk. Unless she\u2019s ready to buy you a new computer if she drops it, she shouldn\u2019t be picking it up", "That\u2019s not really rude. But you could also word it more politely if you wanted \u201cExcuse me, that\u2019s my laptop. Please ask if you\u2019d like to look at it and leave it on my desk so it doesn\u2019t get dropped\u201d. Then you are not rude in any way. Anyone who claims you\u2019re rude to politely advocate for your own belongings is full of shit."]}
