Thanks to everyone who gave genuine advice, I appreciate it. To everyone who called me entitled - you're probably right, I need to work on that. And to the precious few who upvoted my horse joke... I love you. You're the best.\n\n**Original Post:** I (31F) have been living out of home since I was 18. I left uni with a mid-size amount of debt, but I've managed to pay it off and also save \u00a38k over the last 10 years. I have scrimped and saved to get to this point.\n\nMy parents are good people and I love them, but they have made some terrible financial decisions over the years. When my grandmother died, her house was sold and my parents received about \u00a390k. They treated my brother and I to an amazing Christmas and a lovely holiday. They also renovated parts of our family home. After all this, they still had about \u00a350k left and (by their own admission) frittered away the remaining money, rather than saving it. By the time I started uni two years later, I was told that I would need to take out student loans to pay for my fees.\n\n8 years ago, they told us that they were going to sell the family home and downsize to a flat. They managed to sell the house quickly and received about \u00a3250k for it. But there was nothing on the property market that they liked, so they decided to rent for a while until they found something they did.\n\nWithin three years, all of the money was gone. Again, frittered away with nothing to show for it. Now they are in their 60s and renting for the foreseeable future with only a small pension each. My dad will be forced to retire next year and they can't afford their current rent without his salary.\n\nThey have asked me for loans multiple times, just to tide them over until pay day. They do always repay the loans to me, but I've started feeling resentful of giving them money at all. My partner and I are trying to buy a flat, and all of my friends who currently own property have received help from their parents with the deposit. Not only are my parents unable to help me with this, they actively borrow money from my savings on a regular basis.\n\nEarlier this week, we were having a family meal for my dad's birthday. My parents were asking my partner and I about our property situation, and asked if we would consider buying a two-bedroom flat so that they could move in with us and not worry about rent. I laughed at first, thinking that they were joking, but then realised that they were serious. I told them that we wouldn't be doing that, as (A.) we couldn't afford a two-bedroom flat, and (B.) even if we could, it's not my responsibility to house them.\n\nMy dad argued that he and my mum have provided for me over the years, and now it's my turn to repay them. I told him that I have been virtually on my own since turning 18 and just because they made poor financial decisions over the years, I shoudn't have to foot the bill. I said that I resent the fact that they could have helped me with uni and maybe even a flat deposit, but instead they spent their way into a life of living hand-to-mouth.\n\nThis did not go down well. Both of them erupted at me and called me ungrateful. My brother told me that I was being entitled. Even my partner said that I was overly harsh.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1687003837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bpk4g/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_i_resent_their/", "score": 1785, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My father came into a lot of money and, within a year had nothing to show for it. While I never expected any of it I was angry at the time because a fraction of that money in my hands would have gone a long way for me then, and I'd be a lot better off now. \n\nI still hold some resentment because now he's dead and my mother saw none of that money either and is on a pension. \n\nFamily is family.

You won't have room for your parents to move in, and therefore, they're going to have to figure out how to keep afloat without you offering them rent-free accommodation.\n\nI note they're not asking your brother if they can live rent-free in his home.

And tell your brother that he is welcome to provide support for your shared parents if that's important to him.", "NTA.  Maybe you were a bit harsh, but the truth hurts.

I can't blame you for letting all that pent-up resentment erupt when they asked you to house them in return for everything they've done for you, whatever that was. It's the last straw. You've obviously bitten your tongue for long enough. (I know. My parents made oodles of idiotic decisions that adversely affected my life, and they went to their respective graves blithely unaware of the harm they had caused me.)\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd since they CREATED you, they were on the hook for your expenses.  They get no brownie points for doing the bare minimum.", "NTA, while you might have been harsh, they were expecting you to bail them out, tough love I guess. Why doesn't your brother take them in if he thinks you are so wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou need to go no-contact with your financial situation with your parents and brother. Your parents and sibling do not need to know how much you make, how much money you've saved, or even where you live- if it's super nice and they could think you could give them money based on the housing sitch. \n\nBuy your place. Afterwards, tell everyone how you've spent all your money and have no savings. LAMENT that shit. Loudly. Often. Make your parents and siblings feel uncomfortable, like  you are about to ask THEM for money. Slowly decrease the lamentations and hope by then everyone will have trained themselves into looking out for themselves financially. \n\nSadly, you are going to have to hold a part of your life away  from your family. They are moochers. They will always mooch off the person with the most. Always. Dead relatives, living children, everyone. You must put a firm no-discussion financial/economic boundary up.", "NTA at all.  I totally understand the resentment.  Thank goodness I can't relate to it.  My father was always there to get me out of financial jams and I do the same for my children.  Money should go downwards in a family.  I feel pretty bad for your folks though.  That would be humiliating to borrow money from your children.", "NTA I can\u2019t imagine passing away that kind of money and having nothing to show for it\u2014but my parents are the same as yours.

Ok I get loaning a small amount to someone (friend or family) once in awhile to help with something unexpected.  However, doing this, especially to an adult child, to tide them over to the next paycheck... no!  Poor money mgmt on their part.  It wasn't a horrible thing that you funded your own education, look at it this way, you did it on your own...same with the flat your going to purchase.    Your not the one acting entitled, your parents are.  There is nothing wrong with making people own their crap, or calling someone out on their garbage, which you did.  Sometimes the truth isn't pretty, it just is and your right, your parents have squandered a good deal of money for instant gratification, it's not your problem.", "Did they blow the money on fancy restaurants and vacations. Or gambling,  alcohol and drugs. Or are they, like a lot of people,  just thoughtless about money?", "ESH, you seem bitter that they didn\u2019t help with your university costs or with a down payment, neither of which you are entitled to. They suck, because they did blow threw a bunch of money and now they want to mooch off you. You all sound exhausting and entitled.", "Obviously NTA, but your parent don't owe you money for uni or money for a down-payment. \n\nAnd Obviously you don't owe them living support. You might end up with homeless parents tho, and you'll have to figure that out.", "NTA.\n\n\nIt takes only a certain amount to raise a child and they\u2019ve used you as a personal atm long enough to have made their investment back.\n\nCall it a wash. Go No or Low Contact.", "ESH. They suck for asking their kid for money and trying to guilt you into it with the \"You owe us because we fed and housed you when you were a child\" argument.\n\nYou suck for not being more tactful and just saying \"We can't afford that.\" There was no reason to lecture them on poor financial decisions, especially since they spent a good chunk of it on a nicer home and holidays for you. \n\n> Even my partner said that I was overly harsh.\n\nYou were probably too harsh then.  Don't kick people when they are down.  Just politely decline their financial requests.", "ESH. You ARE being entitles to expect help with school and/or housing deposits and their finances weren't your business until they asked you to house them. That makes them also the AH and ridiculous for insinuating that bringing a child into this world and giving them basic care equates to being able to live rent free in their retirement ages. \n\nYou should have said no, absolutely. However adding on that they should have helped you as an adult went too far. The a-holeness is not spread evenly and they recieve more of the blame, of course, but your entitlement to their money as an adult is misplaced.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are under no obligation to loan your parents money or take care of them in old age--and if they are bad with money I would stop doing it. However, your own finances are probably not in order and nor are your partners if you can't afford the down payment. Seems a bit misplaced to focus on your parent's mismanagement rather than your own. Review your finances and come up with a long term plan to acquire what you want--and that may involve cutting off your parents.

Neither you nor your parents can be upset you didn't take care of the other if neither of you is willing to fulfill your obligations to the other.

Likewise, it's nice when adult children can assist their parents financially after retirement, but it's not an obligation. There seems to be a sense of entitlement for each other's money on both sides. You felt entitled to financial assistance because you were poor during university years, and they feel entitled because they're financially strapped as retirement looms. \n\nI think the resentment toward your parents is understandable because you witnessed so many others get help from parents (being envious is just being human), but ultimately I think the resentment is unwarranted. Maybe it's a cultural difference - I'm in the U.S., so it was completely normal for me to apply for and repay my own college loans without financial assistance from my parents. I, too, was cash-strapped during college and I worked three jobs (amounting to 30 hours a week) to cover expenses. It was challenging, especially the semester when I was enrolled in 24 course hours, but I scraped through and don't feel any animosity toward my parents for it. They were always mentally and emotionally supportive and loving, which has a higher value than financial assistance.\n\nIt's generous of you to give your parents loans and attempt to help them, but maybe a little tough love by cutting off the cash flow will force them to be wiser with money.

Perhaps encourage them to go on income support/welfare if you have that there because even if they did keep leeching off you eventually your money could run out too, like what if a sudden & large debt came into your life or you had an accident, would your parents expect your SO to support them, what would their solution be then? Let them know you love them and want to help them but that there\u2019s only so much you can do before you end up sacrificing not only your own livelihood but their future grandchildren\u2019s livelihood, ask them if they would be okay with that and ask them if they think you\u2019d be a good mom if you allowed that to happen.

Financial obligations flow from parents to children, not the other way around.\n\nParents providing for their children is a societal expectation, not a gift or a loan to be repaid.\n\nBut you may need to distance yourself from your parents for a while seeing as they see you as plan B after their terrible financial choices.", "It depends what the spent the money on\u2026.\nMedical bills= understandable \nGambling= no sympathy", "Tip: if someone constantly has to borrow money from you, tell them you need to see where all their money is going.", "For any americans reading this, \u00a330k is considered a pretty good salary in the UK.", "But providing for your own child from zero to 18 is a parental obligation.  \n\n\nNo child should feel under obligation to their parents for their parents doing that. That support is what parents owe their child, and their child is entitled to that support. \n\n  \nI agree with you that support after 18 is not a parental obligation. It's a good thing for parents to do for their children, and I quite see why OP is frustrated by this foolish, spendthrift behaviour, but - after 18, it's not an obligation, except that - within reason - parents should expect that they'll provide an equivalent level of support to *all* their children,  though with regard to the fact that some children may justly need more support than others.   \n\n\nMy parents literally sat down and discussed the terms of their will with me, and with my sister, to confirm we regarded it as fair that we two and my brother were all getting the same share in their will. (My brother has all his life exhibited the same kind of dizzying spendthriftness as OP's parents, and our parents were minded to disinherit him, but the lawyer they consulted was against the idea and me and my sister, without any consultation with each other, spontaneously told our parents we thought causing a family ruckus post-mortem was a *terrible* idea.) Adult children and parents should be able to talk about these things sensibly.  \n\n\nBut all OP should give her parents is a list of financial planners for them to consult, and a bag of groceries if they're running short of money for food.", "The fact they want you and your partner to get bigger flat so they can live rent free is crazy entitled of your parents!  Don't do it.  \n\nYou're complaining brother needs to move in with your parents and take over their rent.  Yes, I'm being sarcastic because he's an adult but not a financially functioning one!\n\nNTA", "Yep. Almost everyone I know takes or took out student loans even if their parents are incredibly wealthy. You just might as well", "In the UK actually paying your uni fees rather than taking out loans is just pointless and honestly a bad decision", "Echoing some others, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re off base. Like yes, you could\u2019ve been more tactful but your accounting of the situation is \u2018spot on\u2019 (as I guess they say in the UK). \n\nWhile you\u2019re not entitled to help from parents after 18, it\u2019s very very common for middle class families to continue to help their children. (I assume middle class since you went to college and they owned a home at one time). And not even just with school tuition, but like you\u2019ve said, with help on a down payment on a first home, or whatever things you may need to help you stabilize yourself as a adult adult. \n\nAnd another thing: it\u2019s very normal to inherit some wealth from one\u2019s parents. Maybe not a large amount but in one\u2019s 40s or 50s or whenever their parents pass, there is another boost that many expect to get. This inter generational passing of wealth is quite significant in the sense that it helps you have more to pass on. While acting entitled to it is bad, it\u2019s 100% reasonable to be disappointed if you don\u2019t get this because you parents chose to make terrible financial decisions. Add on to that they\u2019re making odd demands of you like loans or rent free living (especially before you\u2019ve established yourself), and yes, I personally would be quite upset at them. \n\nWhat the hell did they even spend the money on? That seems like a huge sum to blow through in 3 years.", "Obviously, hindsight is 20/20 - I know this now.", "Hey, no worries! I appreciate you saying it. It's a tough situation to be in, but I know that most people my age are in the same boat. My partner and I are our own people, so we'll just have to prioritise our own finances from now on.", "In the UK paying for uni rather than taking out loans is mostly pointless. Even amongst very wealthy people they take the loans.", "This just seems so weird to me, I\u2019m not trying to judge, just curious, did you go through student finance if you were paying them off at 18 or did you go to a bank for an education loan? Did your 6th form/college not cover this? Did you not have the lectures in freshers week about all of it? I basically couldn\u2019t avoid the ins and outs of it if I tried.", "Oof, that's rough. I'm sorry you had to watch that! It's so frustrating to watch someone spend with abandon when you yourself have such limited means.\n\nLike, if I had that much money and I knew that my parents were struggling, literally the first thing I would do is help them. Why does it never seem to cross their minds?", "It's definitely a pride thing with my parents, but I think they're just going to have to get used to it. They don't really have any other choice.\n\nThat's a good suggestion on the outstanding credit, thank you! I'll definitely chat to them about CAB and see what we're able to do. They definitely won't let me look at their bank statements though, haha. But hopefully everything else will be helpful for them.", "Oh, I wasn't paying them at 18 - they started when I graduated. I was working immediately after uni, so the repayments kicked in pretty quickly.\n\nI did sit through lectures and information sessions on it, but my parents really pushed me to pay them off. The only person in our family who's ever had any kind of debt (aside from mortgages) was one of my dad's brothers, who got himself into trouble with credit cards. My parents were worried about the interest I might incur, but they'd never dealt with the system before.\n\nI did also receive a smaller private loan from someone in my family (not my parents), to help with living costs. Due to my parents' joint income and them contributing nothing to my living expenses, my maintainence wasn't enough for me to live off. So I was paying that back as soon as I was working as well, albeit with no interest (thankfully).", "The funny or sad thing depending on how you look at it is my grandpa paid for my mom's schooling so it's not like a \" I did it. So can you.\" situation.  To make things even worse, the grandkids were supposed to get the money since all my grandpa's kids were established and he felt he already helped his kids enough.  My uncle had power of attorney or was the executor of the will and had it changed so him and his siblings got it. I'm mostly over it now, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't still bother me everytime an unexpected bill comes up.", "My Community College has courses on personal finances, how to budget. Maybe pay a financial Advisor on giving them a financial plan for retirement with the money they'll have. Small efficiency apts for older people-get them on a waiting list. Look to their community for help.", "I think this is just a cultural thing. In my family and immediate community, parents contributing something towards their kids' first house deposit is seen as common. Especially in today's climate, where most of us can't afford the whole deposit by ourselves. Most of us have parents who bought their houses for cheap in the '80s and have long since paid off their mortgages, so they would have some kind of money to contribute.\n\nI understand that this is not the done thing everywhere, though (and I expect to get downvoted on this comment for saying it). I also know that it probably feels ludicrously privileged, but it's honestly the only way that a lot of people my age are able to buy property.\n\nETA: Added a bit extra on the end.", "I don't know if I would say I'm being \"mean\", but enabling, sure. I need to cut them off.", "I'm really sorry to hear this! That's such a frustrating situation to be in, especially when you know that you only have their best interests at heart. Why can't they see that?\n\nI hope you're doing okay and protecting yourself.", "He's not able to financially support them. He inherited the \"spend it all, spend it now\" gene from them.", "I would like to take the same approach, should I ever have kids (provided I can afford them). I don't ever want them to feel like they have to be cold or hungry, I want them to know that they can come to me and I will help."]}
