I left uni with a mid-size amount of debt, but I've managed to pay it off and also save \u00a38k over the last 10 years. I have scrimped and saved to get to this point.\n\nMy parents are good people and I love them, but they have made some terrible financial decisions over the years. When my grandmother died, her house was sold and my parents received about \u00a390k. They treated my brother and I to an amazing Christmas and a lovely holiday. They also renovated parts of our family home. After all this, they still had about \u00a350k left and (by their own admission) frittered away the remaining money, rather than saving it. By the time I started uni two years later, I was told that I would need to take out student loans to pay for my fees.\n\n8 years ago, they told us that they were going to sell the family home and downsize to a flat. They managed to sell the house quickly and received about \u00a3250k for it. But there was nothing on the property market that they liked, so they decided to rent for a while until they found something they did.\n\nWithin three years, all of the money was gone. Again, frittered away with nothing to show for it. Now they are in their 60s and renting for the foreseeable future with only a small pension each. My dad will be forced to retire next year and they can't afford their current rent without his salary.\n\nThey have asked me for loans multiple times, just to tide them over until pay day. They do always repay the loans to me, but I've started feeling resentful of giving them money at all. My partner and I are trying to buy a flat, and all of my friends who currently own property have received help from their parents with the deposit. Not only are my parents unable to help me with this, they actively borrow money from my savings on a regular basis.\n\nEarlier this week, we were having a family meal for my dad's birthday. My parents were asking my partner and I about our property situation, and asked if we would consider buying a two-bedroom flat so that they could move in with us and not worry about rent. I laughed at first, thinking that they were joking, but then realised that they were serious. I told them that we wouldn't be doing that, as (A.) we couldn't afford a two-bedroom flat, and (B.) even if we could, it's not my responsibility to house them.\n\nMy dad argued that he and my mum have provided for me over the years, and now it's my turn to repay them. I told him that I have been virtually on my own since turning 18 and just because they made poor financial decisions over the years, I shoudn't have to foot the bill. I said that I resent the fact that they could have helped me with uni and maybe even a flat deposit, but instead they spent their way into a life of living hand-to-mouth.\n\nThis did not go down well. Both of them erupted at me and called me ungrateful. My brother told me that I was being entitled. Even my partner said that I was overly harsh.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1687003837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bpk4g/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_i_resent_their/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Afterwards, tell everyone how you've spent all your money and have no savings. LAMENT that shit. Loudly. Often.

You must put a firm no-discussion financial/economic boundary up.", "NTA at all.  I totally understand the resentment.  Thank goodness I can't relate to it.  My father was always there to get me out of financial jams and I do the same for my children.  Money should go downwards in a family.  I feel pretty bad for your folks though.

Ok I get loaning a small amount to someone (friend or family) once in awhile to help with something unexpected.  However, doing this, especially to an adult child, to tide them over to the next paycheck... no!  Poor money mgmt on their part.  It wasn't a horrible thing that you funded your own education, look at it this way, you did it on your own...same with the flat your going to purchase.    Your not the one acting entitled, your parents are.  There is nothing wrong with making people own their crap, or calling someone out on their garbage, which you did.

You all sound exhausting and entitled.", "Obviously NTA, but your parent don't owe you money for uni or money for a down-payment. \n\nAnd Obviously you don't owe them living support. You might end up with homeless parents tho, and you'll have to figure that out.", "NTA.\n\n\nIt takes only a certain amount to raise a child and they\u2019ve used you as a personal atm long enough to have made their investment back.\n\nCall it a wash. Go No or Low Contact.", "ESH. They suck for asking their kid for money and trying to guilt you into it with the \"You owe us because we fed and housed you when you were a child\" argument.\n\nYou suck for not being more tactful and just saying \"We can't afford that.\" There was no reason to lecture them on poor financial decisions, especially since they spent a good chunk of it on a nicer home and holidays for you. \n\n> Even my partner said that I was overly harsh.\n\nYou were probably too harsh then.  Don't kick people when they are down.  Just politely decline their financial requests.", "ESH. You ARE being entitles to expect help with school and/or housing deposits and their finances weren't your business until they asked you to house them. That makes them also the AH and ridiculous for insinuating that bringing a child into this world and giving them basic care equates to being able to live rent free in their retirement ages. \n\nYou should have said no, absolutely. However adding on that they should have helped you as an adult went too far. The a-holeness is not spread evenly and they recieve more of the blame, of course, but your entitlement to their money as an adult is misplaced.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can tell you the reason for that is because they're going to treat your house like it's theirs, that they're in charge, and that you have to follow their rules. Think hard about that, then think harder about how your partner will feel about it.", "They should have thought about their 60's years ago like everyone else does. Your parents wasted many opportunities and too much money and that's not on you, their child, to fix. I'm saying this as someone who would do anything for my mum, and as a mother myself. \n\nNTA, it's your parents who are selfish and entitled, not you. They can go live with your brother if he thinks you're so entitled.", "They like having their own space. How is your place their own space? It seems they know they can manipulate you and more than likely not be able to do the same with their siblings. People don't learn their lessons when they have someone enabling them. They are emotionally blackmailing you, please research emotional blackmail. Stop loaning them money. Let them figure it out...they're adults.", "Put this in perspective though. It sounds like you have loving parents who care for you and provided for you and were just bad with money.  That happens.\n\nYou should see some of the posts from other people who have sh*tbag parents who take out loans in their kids names, drain their kids bank accounts, etc.\n\nDid they pay for their other kids' university educations but not yours? No? That would be a reason to hold a grudge.\n\nWhat's next, are you going to whinge and moan at their funerals that they didn't save enough for your inheritance and your life is so unfair because of that?\n\nYou shouldn't be driving a wedge between yourself and your parents over this by calling them irresponsible rehashing your dubious expectations that they should have paid for your university education. \nYou should just politely decline their financials requests and stop discussing money with them.", "Your expecting reciprocity. You're feelings are valid, and most people would be upset if they didn't receive help from someone, and that someone kept asking for help, knowing that they didn't and now couldn't do the same. They were irresponsible and their reasons for not helping you initially was valid. Unfortunately, they didn't use the money for the intended purpose and they're suffering from the consequences. \n\nLove isn't acquiescing to every request. Love is respect, honesty, and recognizing when you are the problem. Since you've consistently been the lifeline, they've never figured out an alternative, such as getting a second or different job. They both can continue working. There are presidents and prime ministers in their 70's. My grandfather is still farming in his 80's. Tell them no, just like they told you no. You can't afford it. The end. Nothing more needs to be said. Take responsibility for your part in this. Yes, hindsight is 20/20 but now you know. Nip it in the bud now", "That is true. I think I will try to talk to them about this soon.", "I think they would find it less embarrassing to have to move into my flat, as it's seen as relatively \"normal\" for parents to live with their children as they get older.", "I think you are right about this. I definitely don't want to feel like I am under their thumb. I want my partner and I to have our own space.", "Thank you! My brother is not in a position to support them unfortunately.\n\nI feel very much the same way. Even if it's entitled for me to want help with uni or a flat deposit (and I'm very much open to that being the case), I still feel angry that they didn't even set enough aside for their own retirement. It just feels so short-sighted, especially considering the sum of money that they had at their disposal.", "You are right, I think. I need to let them survive on their own.", "You know if they moved in it would become *their* flat and the story would be that they are hosting you, right? Thank your brother for offering to support them and tell partner to wind his neck in and back off."]}
