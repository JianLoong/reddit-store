He was on his phone for goodness sakes! He was acting like he didn't want to be a part of the conversation! All he needed to do to get you guys to switch back to English was to unglue himself from his phone and say something in English!", "INFO: Was the topic of the conversation one that your brother could have been included in?", "Why doesn't he learn the language? Presumably there are lots of people in the family who'd be happy to teach him.\n\nNTA", "NTA especially if your brother truly isn't part of the conversation you're having with your Nani and you're not talking about him anyway.", "NTA, but you should help your bro learn the language.  \n\n\nThat's prob why he is upset.  \n\n\nNot because you are speaking another language or anything about him, but he prob feels left out. \n\n\nHelp a brotha out!", "NTA for speaking another language. Also, your brother calling you a \"rude wanker\" is especially uncalled for - NTRW", "Unless your at a poker table in a casino, NTA.", "You say he was sitting with you, but not part of the convo. But, if you had spoken English, or translated for him, he could have been a part of it. He felt excluded, because he was. Your exclusion wasn\u2019t purposeful, but it was inconsiderate. Sorry dude, YTA", "NTA, but still a bit rude.\n\nAt my job everybody speaks Chinese (Mandarin) except for me. They also speak English (very well), but most conversations are in Chinese. I feel very very left out.   \n\n\nI am aware that switching to the mother tongue is something you may do without even realizing it, but it can be quite rude to the people that don't speak this language. On the long term your brother will start ignoring you and walk away every time you speak the other language.", "NTA \u2014 I don\u2019t blame your brother either for not having learned the language. Just all the words to name extended family is so complicated. Dadu, dadi, nanu, nani, phua, phupha, chacha, chachi.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Usually they would say something before the first time they switch. In family settings, it is normal that everybody knows what languages the others speak and are more comfortable with, and switching to another language is expected.\n\nWhen I visit my daughter's family, me and her switch between English and our native language. It depends on the situation. If my son-in-law takes part or somehow indicates he is interested in the conversation, we speak English, if he is not interested, we switch. Some times we can tell him briefly what we were discussing. Your brother knew that you were talking about medical issues, so there is no reason for him to be offended. If he wanted to be a part of the conversation, he should say something to your nani in English, like asking her a question to show that he cares about her problems. But he only cared about himself.", "Ehh technically? She was talking about how slow and tired she feels and some recent med appointments\n\nBut he was on TikTok before we even switched languages so it\u2019s not like he was talking to us at that point", "I\u2019ve tried to do what I can but he\u2019s only able to understand if it\u2019s spoken slowly and he has issues with putting together sentences of his own so he defaults to replying in English", "Yeah that\u2019s fair\n\nI guess I just figured at the time that a kid who is watching TikTok doesn\u2019t need a translation of an old woman\u2019s medical woes \n\nWould have kinda taken away from me trying to console her to translate every sentence for him but I do take your point", "Haha that\u2019s actually the bit he does get!\n\nI find the familial terms really helpful actually, saying aunt or uncle or cousin or BIL or SIL just feels really distant? I like how our terms tell you exactly how someone is related to you \ud83e\udd17", "Doesn't sound like anything he really needed to be included in. NTA, but tell him that what you were talking about didn't really concern him. If there are situations where it'd be worth including him in the conversation, do so. But I don't think this is one of them.", "You need to work on it with him then. It's awkward to refer to this as \"that language\" so I'll call it Asian for quickness - I mean no disrespect by that.\n\nDo say you want to help him master Asian and will work with him on it. Get other family & friends to help.\nMake a point of using Asian object names and actions as a part of English speech. When you know he has them start putting these words in Asian sentences - but do it explicitly. \n\nI know it'll take a long time - I am doing the same thing with Ukrainian and it's bloody painful. But he'll get there: the main thing is that he knows you are  including him.", "I just don't think it's OP's job to do all that. If bro wants to learn, he needs to take his own initiative to learn on his own, or ask his parents. This is not OP's problem.", "TBH the main thing here is how OP's brother feels. Being excluded does hurt and it's reasonable not to like it. If OP is offering to help it puts the responsibility for learning on his brother. If his brother won't work with him then that's on him, but they will both know that is the brother's choice.", "I don't really agree that OP's brother's feelings are the most important here. I would prioritize nana - she switched to her mother tongue because she found it more comfortable. Supporting brother whining about it is basically saying that brother's discomfort at not understanding is more important than Nana's ability to express herself. I can't get behind that level of coddling someone because they feel excluded for like 2 seconds. \n\nBrother can reasonably feel hurt at being excluded. The correct response to this is to take it upon himself to learn the language. No leaning on OP to teach him or manage his feelings. If he needs to lean on someone, he can lean on his parents. But this idea that elder siblings are required to put in this much effort to help younger siblings do things they should be able to do themselves is just too depressing to be a viable way to live.", "YTA. You know your excluding him and its rude to do so.", "NTA, I\u2019m the same background as you but can\u2019t speak our ancestral language because no one ever taught me, at family gatherings and parties sometimes the older people slip into the language and it doesn\u2019t really bother me at all. If I really want to know what they said I\u2019d just ask them!", "Gonna go a different way here but \nY(kind of)TA. \n\n\nI cant speak for specifics here, but I work with a few coworkers who speak Hindi (?) to each other when it's just them and I. It always makes me a little uncomfortable. It does sound like your brother overreacted tho.", "I guess I'm projecting my experience & feelings here. Having people who speak a language you can't understand at all when they do have command of yours can feel exclusionary. \n\nMy response has been to try to learn their language. I don't insist they speak in English nor do I demand they give me lessons. \n\nI think OP sees his brother in a similar situation to me. Hence me saying what I'd find helpful in his brother's position. \n\nI'm also old enough that most of my family have died, so I think I have a more generous view on taking trouble for relatives than a young person.", "I'm also speaking from experience, as an eldest sibling. It is extremely disheartening how everyone, including my own parents, disregard my time and autonomy all in the name of being \"generous\" to younger siblings.\n\nIf I am spending time teaching something to a younger sibling, that is time that I could be spending on my own interests or education. Time I will never get back. When people just reflexively volunteer my time like this, it sends the message that my time and my desires are second place to sibling's crocodile tears. Like the entire purpose of my existence is to make sure younger siblings never have to suffer. Even though no one cared when I suffered, because I don't have older siblings to just fix things on command. \n\nIt's even worse that if I want to say no, I am seen as selfish. However, no one ever sees younger sibling as selfish or badly behaved for not doing what I want them to. It is a patently unfair dynamic that the entire world seems to agree with, and it's exceedingly frustrating and devaluing.", "INFO: Do you/your family often speak in your native tongue around your brother, or is the only instance that it's happened?"]}
