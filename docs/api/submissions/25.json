At the meetup, she arrived with her son, who was in a wheelchair. He was a very sweet boy, and he played well with the other kids. The mother sat on her phone for most of the meetup and didn't participate much in our discussion topic. During one of our attempts to include her in the conversation, she did mention that she is not disabled in any way.\n\nI mentioned that this group is for disabled parents, and she responded that her son is disabled. That's not really relevant. We moved on, but at the end of the meetup we told her she couldn't be a member of the group, because it is a support group for parents with disabilities, and she isn't disabled. She was very offended and kept talking about her son.\n\nOne of the other members explained that this group isn't for the kids, it's for the parents. There are play groups for disabled kids, but we are not that. Yes, our meetups are child friendly, but that is for logistic reasons, because childcare is expensive.

She didn't participate in the meeting and when told the purpose of the group, she called you all the c-word. Maybe she's stressed and thought she found a group for her kid, but that doesn't excuse her behaviour.", "NTA. She literally doesn't fit the groups purpose. Y'all shouldn't feel bad for that. There are groups I'm sure that she and her son would actually fit into", "You can't be TA because someone else doesn't understand words.", "NTA.  \n\n\n She sounded incapable of understanding what you were trying to tell her.  Based on your post, she doesn't seem to have understood that it wasn't disabled kids, but disabled parents.  I don't think she was listening very well.  \n\n\nThere are people like that, and it's baffling.  You can say something and they just somehow don't hear you or understand something you're saying.", "Nta-even after explaining what the purpose of the group is for you guys, she insisted it was a play group by not even listening. Had she been there to discuss your (and other parents) difficulties, maybe she could\u2019ve made a point for inclusion, but that doesn\u2019t sound the case at all here", "NTA and I'm not even sure why she wants to be there tbh. Look, I know people always phrase playgroups as for the kids, and yes, it is good for kids to get that little head start on social skills before school. But the truth is that they are truly for parents to find other parents to talk to. Being a new parent is a lonely experience and so many new mothers get depressed due to just how isolating it is. So, the main purpose of a playgroup is for the parents to have some people who understand what their going through and are just as willing to hang out with small children around. So even if this was a playgroup of some kind (which it's not really, as you said, it's a parents group) I don't get why she'd want to keep coming to a group she's not engaging with at all, doesn't sound like she's looking for friends here or anything. She just sounds like someone who misinterpreted this group and got defensive about it.", "[removed]", "NTA - there are plenty of groups out there for parents of disabled children or for families with disabilities, your group is a parent focused support group and she doesn't fit the qualifications for it!", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she may have misunderstood the group description and then when it was pointed out to her she doubled down.

Her reaction when you tried to correct her tells me that 1) it never occurred to her that differently abled people can have children, 2) she is equating having a disabled child with *being* disabled, which leads to 3) she completely lacks empathy and understanding.\n\nPeople who haven't lost a life partner shouldn't go to widow/widower support meetings.

Incidentally while it is in no way your responsibility to do this, I would maybe have some actual disable child play/support groups on hand you can recommend for if this mix up happens again.

She was a therapist who wanted to do \"market research\", in not so many words.", "NTA\n\nShe very plainly doesn't meet the criteria of your group and was trying to wedge herself into a situation where she doesn't belong.

NIGHTMARE. Often complaining about too much information and about jokes we make, because it's our safe place and joking about difficult situations is an important coping tool. It literally is the only thing keeping some of us going. \n\nParents joining a disability support group, make things difficult for people who do need to open up, because people join these groups so they can talk to people who know first hand what they are going through. It's sometimes incredibly hard when you then get a parent questioning you indepth, sometimes being quite insulting. Getting the wrong end of the stick and worse case scenario going all anti medication, because they are scared by horror stories about bad experiences. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA.

Yeah i remember my mum wishing she could take my pain for me but she knew she couldnt, it hurt her to see me like that but she knew it hurt me far more, cause not only was there the disabilty but watching an knowing you dont get to do what other kids do, thats soul crushing yes for parents too but no where close to what the actual fking person feels jfc", "That would be possible if it was strictly about autism, but the OP seems to indicate its not specifically autism in which case its pretty hard to confuse the words disabled parents with parents of disabled kids.", "Yeah you can't drag those people out of their fantasies kicking and screaming, causes more harm than good.
