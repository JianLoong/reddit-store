{"id": 29355, "submission_id": "17cy8wx", "title": "WIBTA if I prioritize my oldest son's wishes above those of my wife and my younger children?", "selftext": "I have a son who is now 14 from my first marriage. My first wife died when he was 5 and I remarried when he was 7. My wife and I met several months after I lost my wife. We did not enter into a romantic relationship until 16 months after my first wife's passing. However, I know that from starting the romantic relationship to remarrying, we moved fast. I know it was too fast for my son who was young at the time and struggled with the change. I did have him in therapy and our relationship did not suffer because of it, he never stopped confiding in me and talking to me. But his relationship with my wife did suffer as a result. He is not close to her and he is not close to his (half) siblings. We have done family therapy and my son had therapy to help him with the loss of his mom as well as more recently to help him as he deals with my diagnosis.\n\nThis all comes into play because I am terminally ill and my son wants to go to live with my late wife's father, brother and his family once I'm gone. He has expressed this to me since the topic of what happens next became a reality we need to prepare for. My wife does not want my son to leave her and the kids after I die. I know my two daughters will miss my son a lot since they are old enough at 5 and 6 to remember him. My son told me he would not be happy staying with my wife and other children. He told me he would rather be with his real family.\n\nMy wife is aware of the conversation my son and I are having over this topic. She spoke on behalf of herself and our kids. She believes I should tell my son he should stay with them since this is his home and she believes it would spell the end of any sibling relationship if he can get away with never seeing our kids. She believes he could grow more fond of them in time.\n\nI spoke to my late wife's family and they would gladly have my son. They see him regularly as it is and have always been part of his life. I trust that they would take amazing care of my son. But I also believe my wife would.\n\nI believe my son would be happier with his maternal family. I told my wife this and she told me she thought I would want my kids to be close after I'm gone. She thought I respected her as an equal parent in our household. And that I would take more than just what my oldest son wants into consideration. She asked me to really think if it would be best for him. I told him I have been thinking about that. She became angry and we fought about it. I hate fighting with her when I don't have long left. She told me I'm showing a lack of concern or care for her and the kids and accused me of being cold about this.\n\nWIBTA if I prioritize what my son wants and arrange for him to stay with his maternal family after I die?", "created_utc": 1697878559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cy8wx/wibta_if_i_prioritize_my_oldest_sons_wishes_above/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is what he wants. My wife does not want this and my younger kids would be upset by the decision too. I truly feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place and that by trying to respect my son's feelings and in part make up for rushing things with my wife when he was younger, I might be making a choice that causes a lot of harm to my other children and wife and that by disregarding my wife, I am making these last few weeks/months harder on my family. Perhaps I should be trying more to figure out a compromise but my heart already tells me to let my son choose and respect his choice. I know making that choice will cut out everything my wife says though and as her spouse that could make me TA to her as well as to our kids.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a sucky situation all around, and I think you should encourage him to maintain some kind of relationship with his siblings, even if he doesn't live with them, but this kid is going to be fully orphaned as a teenager; he is by far the one who is going to feel your loss the most, and he should be allowed to be with the people who will help him heal.", "NTA.

He deserves every chance to succeed in life and there's no compromise to be made in that.  \n\nYour wife's reaction actually proves your decision is correct.   She isn't putting your 14 year old as any priority.

I don\u2019t know your son or his disposition, but if you force him to stay it seems to me much more likely conditions to breed resentment.

Stepmom is caring about what's best for her and her kids, not what is in the son's best interest. NTA", "That's the conclusion I came to as well. Even though it's not the perfect solution for everyone. My son is going to be an orphan once I'm gone and that is going to be a hugely traumatic thing for him. I want him to be as happy and comfortable as he can be afterward.", "It's something I have mentioned. My wife doesn't believe he would actually stay in touch with his siblings (my wife and I have a son as well). I don't know if I believe he would stick to it either. He might say yes now but when the time comes he might never actually keep in touch. It's something I have considered. And while the thought is painful for me, and I know would be painful for my wife and younger kids, I still can't see my son staying with my wife as the best option given his feelings on this topic. Given he would essentially be living with a guardian he already doesn't turn to for anything. At least I'm here and he does talk to and confide in me. But when I'm no longer here, I worry he could be going through something and would bottle it up. I worry he would run away. I also worry about the resentments that would fester over time.", "I really hope you warmed up and stretched before taking that leap. A body could get hurt just leaping all crazy like", "Where did you get that from?", "I truly do not believe this is about my wife wanting help. I believe it's about her keeping everyone together because she loves all four kids and she feels my son is wrong about what's best for him.", "And set up milestone presents too for his maternal family to store until the appropriate events come up. Anything you want to leave him would be best with them rather than your wife because she\u2019d leverage them trying to continue forcing the relationships that aren\u2019t going to happen, and the paperwork airtight that she can\u2019t contest.", "I know that she will always leave the door open for him, even if she's hurt about this. She loves him and I know she would gladly have him in her life at any point. Though I don't fully believe he will have a change of heart on them when I'm gone. I would love if he did, even just to remain in touch with them. But deep down I don't really believe it will happen.", "Exactly,  he has already lost his mom.  Now he will loose his dad and his mom again to a certain extent.  You are his only real contact with his mom and her memory.  He doesn\u2019t like or trust his stepmother.  Forcing him to stay with her could cause a downward spiral in him.  I think it is not about what is best for your son or the 5 or 6 year old but what is best for her.  Maybe she wants to use him to help parent the kids.  \n\nShe had almost a decade to build a relationship with her stepson and it never happened.  Please do what is best for your son.  Maybe talk with your wife\u2019s family and see if they can face time or something.  You just cannot ignore your son\u2019s feelings.", "Right, I\u2019m going to be slightly cynical here. To me, it sounds like your wife is hoping to force your son to provide childcare for her children after you\u2019re gone, as you won\u2019t be able to advocate for your son after you pass away. \n\nIf you approach your wife with this, clearly she won\u2019t admit it even if I have \u2018hit the nail on the head\u2019 here. \n\nYour son has a right to having his life lived in his best interests, not your wife\u2019s. \n\nI can only go off the information you provided but I get the feeling your wife is hoping that she can control your son and his life going forwards in a way that benefits her interests. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the situation you\u2019re in and I hope you\u2019re able get everything sorted and peacefully live out the time remaining to you.", "It's also a very real possibility that neither you or your wife could force him to live with her when you are gone even if you try. Depending on the specific laws where you live of course.\n\nHas she adopted him? If not custody is, in most places, not automatic. And what you put in your will is an expression of what you want, not legally binding. The paternal family absolutely could push the state for custody and given how old he is and the fact that's what he wants, they would probably win. Again location dependent of course.", "Absolutely it would fester. There is no way forcing him to do it is going to work. You might be able to suggest that he try it for a little bit and if it doesn't work, he can go stay with his grandfather, uncle, and family, but you'd probably have to make them the guardians of him in advance and trust them to follow your wishes. I doubt your wife would pass guardianship to them if it wasn't already set in stone.\n\nI grew up hating living with my own mom. I begged to go live with my dad until I was 13 and she finally relented. Best day of my life. And then I became closer to my mom than I thought was possible. Being heard at that age is a huge deal. Stand by him until you can't anymore.\n\nAnd I didn't say this before, but it's horrible you have to go through this. Your wife should be doing everything in her power to make things easier for you, not digging her heels in and fighting. I hope you find a way to make peace with her quickly and move on to just being there with your family and not having to worry about this stuff.", "And all very legitimate.", "Unfortunately your wife is just that\u2026.YOUR wife\u2026not his mother. And when you pass (I\u2019m so sorry for the situation you are in) he would automatically be given to next of kin\u2026which isn\u2019t your wife\u2026it would be extended family. Your wife would have to adopt your son or be granted custody of your son bc she\u2019s not his mother.", "Is your wife in therapy? If not, I highly recommend it. \n\nI\u2019m personally in therapy right now because my father is terminally ill too and I\u2019ve had to deal a lot of \u201cpreemptive grief\u201d. I also keep getting *really angry* with my dad for dying even though it\u2019s obviously not his fault. So then I feel guilty about the anger. And then I tell myself I shouldn\u2019t be feeling guilty and I get annoyed with myself! And so on and so on.\n\nAnyway, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your wife was having similar emotions (and beating herself up for them, like I was). If she is, then therapy will really help.  I have no judgment to make on your initial question but I\u2019m really sorry about the whole situation. \n\nBtw I hope you\u2019re in therapy too. My dad won\u2019t go and he\u2019s\u2026 well he says he\u2019s \u201cfine\u201d but he\u2019s also not acting like my dad anymore. He\u2019s repressed so many emotions that he\u2019s just not himself and I honestly have no interest in spending time with the man he\u2019s become. \n\nGood luck OP", "You sure about that?  She\u2019s looking down the barrel of being a single parent to multiple small children.  Of having a decade or more of being a truly single parent.  Having your son available to babysit, drive, etc for at least a few more years has GOT to be playing into her position.  Why else would she prioritize everyone else except your oldest?  Why is she so quick to completely dismiss his wishes?  Stick up for your son because once you\u2019re gone, no one else will be willing to do so if you capitulate to your wife.", "Someone I knew of had a deal with a few friends who would deliver a birthday card each year to their daughter that they wrote before they died, along with a picture of the two of them having fun. That little girl looked forward to that more than anything in the world.", "If she truly loves him then she has know that she needs to put his feelings, needs and wishes ahead of her own.  Remember that old saying about if you love something set it free \u2026\n\nIf she forces him to stay with her then he\u2019ll resent both her and his half siblings forever and will be out the door the moment he turns 18, desperate to get away from what he\u2019ll no doubt feel is a jail sentence, and none of them will ever see him again.  But if she respects and supports his wishes then perhaps, just perhaps there\u2019s a chance that when he\u2019s older, more mature and the first few years of raw grief have ebbed, he might find a way to build a relationship with his siblings.\n\nI think you need to get everything legally set up for him to go to his maternal family in a watertight way now and I think you need to make it very clear to your wife that her behaviour is ruining the short time you have left that should be spent making special memories.  She is actively making things harder for you for purely selfish reasons, even though I understand she is grieving for what she is losing.  \n\nI\u2019m so very sorry you\u2019ve been dealt this lousy hand, and that your son has too.  I\u2019m sad for your daughters but they\u2019ll still have their mum, but your son doesn\u2019t have that.  Please don\u2019t deprive him of the family that does make him feel safe, loved and secure.\n\nI wish you as peaceful a journey as you can possibly have moving forward.", "I hope that you have set your son up financially. Do not leave your wife in charge of anything for your son! Let him live with his blood family because clearly he does not like your wife", "I would like to highlight to OP this fact. After trying for almost a decade, there is still nothing resembling even a simple trusting relationship. Much less a very deep relationship that would have him consider his step-mom his \"second mom\".\n\nOp's wife actually sounds like a very good person. She is just no smart enough to know she can't win. If she loves this kid that much. She should let him go where he will be the happiest and not worry about what she wants or expects.\n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s clear he does not have a close relationship with the 1/2s he might when they all become older but he will not ever if he is forced to stay.", "I don't think there is anything in the post to indicate that. I think the wife is just grieving, and desperate to hold the remains of her family together, without thinking about what's best for the family members as individuals.", "I think she wants to ensure all the inheritance from him and his late wife for herself. She doesn't care about the child.", "Actually, that wouldn't be strictly true in our state. The state would intervene if I did not make the arrangements legal myself. Then it would become a battle between both sides for him. But my wife would have a chance because she lived with him for 7 years and could claim she is a parental figure. It would just be more chaos than anyone needs after a loss. It would also make things harder for my son long term.", "Or even what's best for the family. Forcing him to stay would just make everything harder for everyone.", "Interesting how each state works. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through any of this."]}
