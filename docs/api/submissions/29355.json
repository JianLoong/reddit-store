{"id": 29355, "submission_id": "17cy8wx", "title": "WIBTA if I prioritize my oldest son's wishes above those of my wife and my younger children?", "selftext": "I have a son who is now 14 from my first marriage. My first wife died when he was 5 and I remarried when he was 7. My wife and I met several months after I lost my wife. We did not enter into a romantic relationship until 16 months after my first wife's passing. However, I know that from starting the romantic relationship to remarrying, we moved fast. I know it was too fast for my son who was young at the time and struggled with the change. I did have him in therapy and our relationship did not suffer because of it, he never stopped confiding in me and talking to me. But his relationship with my wife did suffer as a result. He is not close to her and he is not close to his (half) siblings. We have done family therapy and my son had therapy to help him with the loss of his mom as well as more recently to help him as he deals with my diagnosis.\n\nThis all comes into play because I am terminally ill and my son wants to go to live with my late wife's father, brother and his family once I'm gone. He has expressed this to me since the topic of what happens next became a reality we need to prepare for. My wife does not want my son to leave her and the kids after I die. I know my two daughters will miss my son a lot since they are old enough at 5 and 6 to remember him. My son told me he would not be happy staying with my wife and other children. He told me he would rather be with his real family.\n\nMy wife is aware of the conversation my son and I are having over this topic. She spoke on behalf of herself and our kids. She believes I should tell my son he should stay with them since this is his home and she believes it would spell the end of any sibling relationship if he can get away with never seeing our kids. She believes he could grow more fond of them in time.\n\nI spoke to my late wife's family and they would gladly have my son. They see him regularly as it is and have always been part of his life. I trust that they would take amazing care of my son. But I also believe my wife would.\n\nI believe my son would be happier with his maternal family. I told my wife this and she told me she thought I would want my kids to be close after I'm gone. She thought I respected her as an equal parent in our household. And that I would take more than just what my oldest son wants into consideration. She asked me to really think if it would be best for him. I told him I have been thinking about that. She became angry and we fought about it. I hate fighting with her when I don't have long left. She told me I'm showing a lack of concern or care for her and the kids and accused me of being cold about this.\n\nWIBTA if I prioritize what my son wants and arrange for him to stay with his maternal family after I die?", "created_utc": 1697878559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cy8wx/wibta_if_i_prioritize_my_oldest_sons_wishes_above/", "score": 4686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is what he wants. My wife does not want this and my younger kids would be upset by the decision too. I truly feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place and that by trying to respect my son's feelings and in part make up for rushing things with my wife when he was younger, I might be making a choice that causes a lot of harm to my other children and wife and that by disregarding my wife, I am making these last few weeks/months harder on my family. Perhaps I should be trying more to figure out a compromise but my heart already tells me to let my son choose and respect his choice. I know making that choice will cut out everything my wife says though and as her spouse that could make me TA to her as well as to our kids.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a sucky situation all around, and I think you should encourage him to maintain some kind of relationship with his siblings, even if he doesn't live with them, but this kid is going to be fully orphaned as a teenager; he is by far the one who is going to feel your loss the most, and he should be allowed to be with the people who will help him heal.", "NTA.

He deserves every chance to succeed in life and there's no compromise to be made in that.  \n\nYour wife's reaction actually proves your decision is correct.   She isn't putting your 14 year old as any priority.

I don\u2019t know your son or his disposition, but if you force him to stay it seems to me much more likely conditions to breed resentment.

Given he would essentially be living with a guardian he already doesn't turn to for anything. At least I'm here and he does talk to and confide in me.

It is even MORE IMPROBABLE that he will feel close to your wife after he suffers the death of his only remaining parent (as he sees it) and the one person he trusts and feels safe with.\n* That is all the more true because your son sees that your wife does the following:\n\n1.

Does not see your son as the individual he is - whose wants, needs, limits, etc. do not conform (or need to conform) to her expectations of who and what he should be.\n3. Has every intention of using her role as 'his parent' to force him into playing the role she thinks he should play and zero intention of trying to understand and accept him as he is.\n4.

I was widowed when my son was 14.  So, I had to contemplate what would the plan be for my son if something happened to me before he was ready and able to be on his own.  All of those thought processes of what to do was about his best interests to give him the best support and best living situation that he needs to grow up with out being messed up.\n\nSo, I am sure that it what your thought process is now.  You know that the best situation for your son where he feels safe and loved and encouraged is with your late wife\u2019s family.  It\u2019s his way of going to home to mommy.  I know you know that.\n\nYou need to make sure he can go, and forcing him to have a relationship with his half siblings is only going to cause resentment.  He has to process his feelings and find a place for them in his life.  You can\u2019t force that and your current wife can\u2019t force that.  Just from the age perspective, a 14 yr old boy has absolutely nothing in common with 5 and 6 yr old girls.  So there isn\u2019t a basis for any common interests or age appropriate activities.  That is the reality.  So forcing visits at this age, it\u2019s going to work.  If the kids were closer in age and shared some of the activities, then there would be a base on which to build a relationship now.  But there isn\u2019t.  HOWEVER, there is a base when everyone is older, and the raw emotions from this tragedy are memories rather than current.  There is an opportunity once your son is off on his own and your younger kids are college age where they will now have some common experiences and interests as young adults.  I have a younger siblings, 2 yrs and 10 years younger.  The youngest sibling and I did not have a deep relationship when we were kids, simply because of the age difference.  What teenager wants to hang out with a preschooler??  Nope, not happening.  What teen wants to babysit a kindergartener when they could be out hanging with friends??  Nope.  HOWEVER, now that my sister and I are adults, we have a great relationship because we are both adults and have a common connection.  We laugh about how different our parents were between me and her, and how much the same they were too.  I am thankful that my parents didn\u2019t force a relationship when I was a teen and college kid.  We naturally came back together when I would talk about the early days and our grandparents that she doesn\u2019t really remember.\n\nYour wife\u2026. She is being selfish.  She is putting her desires and her needs before your son\u2019s needs.  She is showing that she will never be a parent to him and he doesn\u2019t see her as one because she doesn\u2019t put his needs before her own.  She is selfishly trying to fill her needs and the needs of her children over your son\u2019s needs.  He knows that if he lives with her and it comes down to something he needs vs his siblings, your wife will choose her own bio kids over him.  She will never shoes him over her own bio kids.  She may love him, but she isn\u2019t putting what is best for him above her desires for her bio kids.  He knows he will have NO ONE in his corner if he is forced to live with her.  And I think you know that too.\n\nSo, you are doing the right thing by allowing him to go live with his mom\u2019s family.  I would suggest that you think about when that time is, because you may be hospitalized or not able to communicate, so your son will want to see you, but living with your wife may be challenging for him, particularly if she tries to convince him to change his mind.  I would also suggest that you explain to your wife that needs to accept that the best situation for your son right now and for the next 8 years as he grows into adulthood is to be with people who can put him first every time where he feels most comfortable and safe.  It is what she would want for her children if she passed.  And she needs to let go of her desire for a relationship between the siblings now, but leave the door open for them to have a relationship when all the kids are older.  The children only have a short time as children (20 years), but they have a lifetime as adults (60 years). \n\nHope this helps.", "NTAH sir. You need to prioritize your son in this situation. He\u2019s already lost his mother and needs to be with the people who will help him through the loss of his other parent which quite frankly just isn\u2019t your wife. He would be the older \u201cresponsible\u201d child after you\u2019re gone, which means she would rely on him to help her but not prioritize his needs to grieve. This is already going to be traumatic for him and his mental health and to ignore his wishes now will ensure that he never has a relationship with his half siblings in the future. Ask him to remember that his siblings are losing their dad and that they will want to know him in the future because he will be their only link to their father just like his mother\u2019s family is his link to his mother. He deserves his own place to feel safe and loved.", "NTA, so sorry for what you and all your family are going through,  your son is old enough to know what he wants and forcing him to stay won't build a positive relationship. \nTry and get all your finances in order,  making your wishes clear and watertight is a real gift.

I'm not going to accuse her of being an evil step-mother, because it's likely she's just scared of all the change and grief- but at the end of the day you need to make sure you do what is best for your son. \n\nNo one ever developed a good relationship with step-siblings by being forced to.

Maybe that is that he goes over for one family meal a week, or one meal at a restaurant together a month, or attending kids school concerts, or visiting quarterly for the weekend when he\u2019s in college\u2026etc. \n\nYou need to do what\u2019s best for your son. Your wife should want what\u2019s best for him too. \n\nTherapy for everyone though. Most especially your wife.

Half her household and family will leave her all at once.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry to hear about your diagnosis and going through this. \n\nRealistically, if your son feels this strongly, I would honor his wishes. He\u2019s going to to go through some trauma of losing both parents and keeping him where he doesn\u2019t will be will just grow the resentment he has with your wife. Even if you forced him to stay, it\u2019ll only be for a few years as he would likely leave as soon as he turns 18. With the time you have left, you can help him transition as much as you can and maybe he\u2019ll want a relationship with his siblings when he\u2019s had time to grieve and matured.", "This is a very sad situation.

They can build a routine of visitation, whether it be for holidays or just randomly.

Like in a custody agreement - he can visit a 3 times a year or they can come over for Thanksgiving and during the week of winter break or something.

When my brother\u2019s dad died when he was 7 his oldest sister\u2019s(my stepsisters) did not keep in touch at all. He hasn\u2019t seen them in decades and honestly as much as it sucked at the time it was absolutely what was best. They would\u2019ve allowed their resentment towards my mom fester and create a toxic situation for everyone. That wasn\u2019t what was best for anyone at all. My brother is 30 and knows he\u2019s got 3 older sisters he doesn\u2019t know but I can honestly say it doesn\u2019t bother him at all. He remembers them from his early childhood but doesn\u2019t feel any certain way about them. In his eyes he only has 2 sisters. Me and our older sisters and that\u2019s enough for him. In an ideal world your son would keep in touch and have a relationship with everyone but in an ideal world you also wouldn\u2019t be dying so since this isn\u2019t ideal then your wife needs to allow him to do what\u2019s best for him and help her children navigate the fallout of losing their father.

Just because his sisters and your wife want him to stay in touch, doesn\u2019t mean he has to. He\u2019s old enough to have his own agency. Forcing your son to stay with your wife and her kids will be the absolute worst situation for everyone involved:\n\nYour sons memories of you will be forever tarnished because you made him live somewhere against his wishes. He\u2019ll resent you, your wife and your wife\u2019s kids and likely act out a lot, which will very much affect his schooling and his life up until he leaves when he hits 18 anyway. His mom died when he was 5 and you thrust him into a new family at 7 which he obviously doesn\u2019t feel is his own (no shade towards you, you\u2019re allowed to find new love), now with you passing, it would be an extremely shit thing to do to leave him in a family he obviously feels alienated in and that he doesn\u2019t consider his own. \n\nYour daughters will get old enough to feel the resentment and this will have a detrimental effect on them. If you force him to stay until he\u2019s 18, he very well might leave and never contact any of them again, which would have a huge negative impact on them too. At least if you let him live with his mothers family, with your request to him after your passing being that you\u2019d like him to stay in touch with his siblings, he may actually make an effort to do that for you because of the fact that you listened to him and considered his feelings. If you ignore his feelings, he will likely cut them all off out of spite towards you ignoring his wishes and making him live with your wife. \n\nYour wife will be left with a child in her household who will very likely cause problems if he has no one he can confide in, living in a house with no one he considers proper family. He will act out, run away, cause arguments, etc. not to mention that he will very quickly start a legal battle along with his moms family to get custody of him, given your previous comments surrounding the legal environment of your state/country. This, along with raising 3 young children, will have a massive detriment to the household in general, everyone will suffer in this case.\n\nOverall, forcing him to stay will be a net negative for everyone involved. I don\u2019t think the slim likelihood of everyone getting along is worth the risk of the much higher likelihood of the above. Your wife is likely traumatized by the scenario and her life falling apart with effectively 2 members of the regular family unit gone. That being said, forcing your child to stay with someone they are not related to and have no bond with when they have very much expressed that they do not want this is a horrible thing to do imo, YWBTA if you did this.\n\nI can understand your wife\u2019s position (albeit I\u2019m giving her benefit of the doubt, the pessimist in me makes me very afraid for your sons welfare if she gets custody of him and control of finances), but I think you need to do right by your son and put your foot down that this will be the case for the benefit of everyone involved. Doing this now will at least nip it in the bud and allow you to have some peace before you go, you don\u2019t want to be constantly arguing and have this hanging over you when you don\u2019t have much time left, nor do you want your memory to be tarnished by the shitshow that would immediately follow, where family members will be arguing over custody instead of spending time remembering you. \n\nWith all that said, I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I hope that you\u2019ve been able to live a life that\u2019s made you happy and somewhat fulfilled.

While your wife seems to care, she can\u2019t care about him as much as his grandparents cousins etc. My thought is let him go where he has family and roots.

Are your in-laws ready to take financial responsibility for your son or will his leaving impact your wife and three very young children's financial well-being if you have to divert a portion of your estate to your son?\n\nOne idea is to calculate what child support would look like for each child until they are 18 in aggregate and if money is tight, have a very honest discussion with wife, son, and in-laws about the financial impact of this decision. You owe it to your young kids to provide for them as much as you can after your death and not screw them over in favor of the eldest.\n\nAdding here calculations for what that would look like. If we round to the year and disregard months to birthdays, a 14 year old, 6 year old, 5 year old, and 3 year old to be supported until they are 18 creates obligations of 4 years + 12 years + 13 years + 15 years. 4+12+13+15=44 years of support needed to provide to these children.\n\nWife obviously inherits all joint assets and a portion of the remaining assets is standard, usually it shouldn't go below 1/3 of the estate assets.\n\nThe rest of the children should be provided for in your estate in accordance with the years out of the 44 total they need support until they hit 18.\n\nFirst Child: 4/44 (x 2/3 of the estate) = 6.06% of total estate\n\nSecond Child: 12/44 (x 2/3 of the estate) = 18.18% of total estate\n\nThird Child: 13/44 (x 2/3 of the estate) = 19.7% of total estate\n\nFourth Child: 15/44 (x 2/3 of the estate) = 22.73% of total estate\n\nWife: 33.33% of total estate\n\nWife will get her three children's portion of the estate since she would be in charge of using those monies to support them until 18, so she should get 93.04% of the non-joint estate assets. Even if you decided to run this calculation entirely excluding your wife, it would break down with your first son getting only 9.09% of your estate. Three young kids and getting them to 18 in today's economy is not cheap and these calculations reflect that reality.\n\nYour first son undoubtedly should be allowed to decide where he lives after your death, but should your in laws expect a portion of your estate to come to them to support him, they should be aware that given the fewer years he has until he reaches 18, only around 6-9% would be a fair amount to provide for him. Perhaps that is a nonissue in your family and this situation. But if it is, addressing it openly with your wife and embracing a rubric which fairly provides for your young children with respect to how many more years they have to go before they could even begin to be independent will help to assuage her concerns.\n\nOnce she gets that this is your son's decision, but that it will not unfairly harm her ability to provide for your young kids, she will be able to accept it and will start attempting to shift to the new reality where she will have to build a relationship with him that is different and respects his autonomy.\n\nIt will crush your daughters to lose their Dad and effectively their big brother in the same week.

He deserves to do what\u2019s best for him during this time and also for his dad to look out for what\u2019s best for him.", "I believe that\u2019s how OP\u2019s son describes them, not the OP.", "It would be true in divorce as well for the most part and more importantly he hasn\u2019t bonded to the halflings", "It really does feel like a screw you to us users. Not being able to meaningfully push something to the top of a post that we all agree needs to be first seen. \n\nI liked that solidarity, and I miss how much advice and good stories you'd see because of it.", "Force the adoption on him? What a terrible idea. I'm glad that the father and his wife never did that.", "So the son should suffer.  You make no sense.", "90% they are \n\nIf she wasn't she would have push for adoption a long  time ago", "Everybody might not be an evil stepmother but people get really crazy about money when people die... And that was my first thought that came to mind. Especially if there was money left over from the death of his mother.", "Doubtful given her entire lack of care towards what's best for him.", "She doesn\u2019t sound like a good person to me . She is literally pressuring this dying man to force his son who doesn\u2019t like her even after 10 years to stay with her and her kids after his passing . She is outright demanding that the boy\u2019s wants about his own life not be taken into consideration", "Right, stepmom is maybe envisioning the teen keeping the lawn mowed and snow shoveled, household chores and being there for the little ones. The reality would be more like having an angry teen who keeps his distance, takes an after-school job and moves out as soon as he can.", "Do you realize your entire post is about her.  Her comfort, her feelings.  Doesn\u2019t the son deserve the same consideration?", "But this isn\u2019t divorce; it\u2019s the end of his father\u2019s life. Huge difference between them.\n\nThese are the only siblings he\u2019s known. For seven years, that bonding and the trauma of losing his mother has to be managed by the adults in his life. Fourteen is also an early age to know whether he will never again need the proximity of siblings and his stepmother.", "If the parents divorced instead of one dying, they wouldn\u2019t be living together anymore.", "Emancipation would be the ideal scenario. Sadly though that's a big process and he may end up running away instead. OP surely doesn't want his son in a dangerous situation but who knows. OP so selfishly rushed his poor son into this while still grieving his mom. And now he's selfishly entertaining good selfish wife's desire to keep this poor son captive.", "Then for God\u2019s sake do the necessary paperwork NOW while you still can.", "I don't see any possible outcome where not honoring your son's wishes does not result in him disliking your wife and children more. Even in the best case scenario she does everything perfectly, doesn't ask him to do anything for his siblings and starts putting his feelings and needs in grief above everyone else's he will still resent her and you for not honoring his wishes. Reality is he will leave the minute he turns 18 if she makes him stay and never look back. It will actually be easier for your younger kids to have reduced contact now than in 3-4 years. \n\nI would also recommend putting anything you want him to inherit in a trust for him controlled by his maternal grandparents. The less there is to fight about the better chance your son will continue to have a lifelong relationship with his siblings.", "Nope. You can\u2019t read. I said the son should go now, he going to leave anyway, right. OP is concerned about his son-I get that. But his daughters aren\u2019t puppies either. Everyone says, \u201cThey have their mom\u201d yeah, but they\u2019re losing TWO people and nobody cares? The son? HE KNOWS what they\u2019ll be going through. Dad has seen that. But doesn\u2019t worry or ask if the son could help the girls? His SISTERS? That\u2019s my point. This is a shifty situation all around. But let\u2019s just make it all worse by ignoring two other children.

He would be miserable staying and it probably would lead to depression, acting out, possibly self harm, maybe getting into real trouble where the law is involved. But I wasn\u2019t addressing that. Because the OP has his priorities right. He\u2019s putting his kid first.\n\nBut yeah, it also should be obvious that all the reasons I provided, beyond the built in babysitter, are incredibly self-serving on the wife\u2019s part and in no way take the kid into consideration. I wasn\u2019t trying to justify what she\u2019s feeling. She\u2019s acting on wholly selfish emotions. I\u2019m just saying that her reasons may not be as simple as \u201cif he leaves, who is gonna watch the kids?\u201d There may be more complex fears that she\u2019s not expressing and it\u2019s manifesting in \u201che needs to stay.\u201d", "Calling someone cold because they\u2019re taking in account what\u2019s best for their son over where HE lives while they\u2019re dying is dramatic and manipulative.", "Most states, any size inheritance is locked up until 18 or 21 anyway. She wouldn't have access as his guardian.\n\nMy cousin died and her daughter's inheritance is untouchable by the child's father. He was legally not allowed to be the conservator and all funds are to be held until the kid is 21 and she can only use the money for 'bona fide needs'. My other cousin has to sign off on money usage. It can't be used for housing or educational needs because those are to be provided by the parent, not the child.\n\nThink the only major exceptions are for like necessary home repairs if the home is being held for the minor to inherit later. (Here minors can't inherit a home, so it'd be like the Trust of Jane Doe owns it until Jane Doe Jr is old enough. The Trust of Jane Doe can use it's own funds to furnish insurance, pay taxes, repair the roof, etc. It can't pay for a private school.)\n\nIt's harder to steal an inheritance these days.", "But they aren\u2019t his siblings in full. I think having blood take care vs step mom would be more appropriate. The step mom hasn\u2019t bonded to the child. Why would you want the child to be unhappy?", "He should have to leave and give up on spending as much time as possible with his dying dad because his toddler half sisters might be sad about it?  That\u2019s crazy.", "This shouldn't be entirely an either/or situation.  \n\nThe son should live with someone who will put his needs first. But care needs to be taken that he doesn't lose his half-siblings and any positive relationship he has with them. \n\nThe stepmother's conflict of interest is clear.  She'll always be tempted to prioritize her kids over one unrelated to her. \n\nBut the same applies to the late wife's brother, who would be caring for the son alongside his own kids.  Also to his maternal grandfather, if he's been living with the son's uncle for a long time, and has helped raise the uncle's kids.\n\nThe son's preferences need to be taken into consideration.  But it is hard to know if he's wanting to live with his maternal family for their sake, or because he sees it as getting away from his stepmom.\n\nThe best bet may be for the son to live with the maternal family, but for stepmom to have some involvement, especially in regards to maintaining contact with his half-siblings.", "So, following your point-just because their mom is there it\u2019s okay if after they lose their dad, then they\u2019re brother-because mom is there it\u2019s all okay? I just must care more about his other children he does or any of you. Oh well. Have a good day.", "I sadly had a similar thought. Also, even if she didn\u2019t have babysitting in mind, it will be more work for her to make sure the kids have a relationship if they\u2019re living in separate homes.", "Yes it was in the wording \"she says I haven't  thought of her and the kids\" I mean the son IS one of the kids and she called him cold. Like, what? He's dying and wants to make sure everyone is taken care of in the best way possible. All he's doing is caring about other people right now. It sounds like she's counting on oldest son to be a support person for her and that's not fair to the oldest son.", "Yeah, we have no idea what's running through Mrs. OP's head, the OP doesn't say and probably doesn't know.  \n\nBut she's got to be very afraid for the future, wondering how she's going to cope on her own with very young children. So...", "So just fuck his final moments with his dying dad, right? No one ever said he'd never see them again. If all goes right and they don't push him, maybe he'll visit! But right now? OP is right to stand by his son. He does not have to stay anywhere he doesn't want to after the traumatic death of BOTH his parents at only 14, and he doesn't have to give up his final moments with his dad for the sake of two siblings whom he doesn't really care for. \n\nAre you the stepmom on an alt account?", "Nothing about this situation is okay but it doesn\u2019t need to be compounded by disregarding the son\u2019s desire and need to be with his mom\u2019s family afterward.", "And, even more importantly, a trustee who can be counted on to use the money appropriately.\n\nIt is very, very tempting for any non-professional trustee to \"borrow\" money from the trust, because there is no oversight.  Even if the son can get the courts to intervene, once the money is gone, he's unlikely to get it back.  And a teenager should not be in the position of having to challenge a trustee who is misusing the trust, and can't be expected to know the laws about trusts. \n\nIt's also easy for a trustee who is also the caregiver to come to believe that almost anything is for the child's benefit.  \"I'm going to use the trust to remodel the kitchen!  It's for his benefit, because he uses the kitchen too, and eats the food prepare there.'\n\nA professional trustee avoids these problems, but brings other issues to the table.\n\nThe trustee is paid from the trust, which can quickly eat up a small trust.\n\nTrustees have the dual responsibilities of preserving the trust and of using it to benefit the beneficiary of the trust.  \n\nProfessional trustees tend to focus on preserving the trust financially.  There are a few reasons for this.  \n\nFirst, most professional trustees control a pool of trusts, with multiple beneficiaries.  This means they don't know the individual needs of each beneficiary. \n\nSecond, it is easier for someone to claim they are misusing the trust if they buy things for the beneficiary, versus keeping the money intact for the future.  \n\nPeople may question \"you used money for the trust to buy a wheelchair for the beneficiary. But Medicaid would have bought a wheelchair! You misused the funds!\"  This can lead to lengthy and expensive challenges in court, when the trustee has to demonstrate the benefits of the wheelchair they bought over the one Medicaid would have paid for. \n\nNo one will question \"You invested the money wisely, and the trust has more money when you hand it over to OP's son when he's 25.\"\n\nThe key is to find a trustee who has the impartiality and professionalism of a professional trustee, but the individualized interest in the beneficiaries needs, and desire to use the trust's money to meet those needs, as a caregiver-trustee of the best sort will do.", "Right??  I\u2019m trying to figure out where all of these people are getting this \u201cit\u2019s absurd to even SUGGEST that she\u2019s only thinking of herself and her kids!\u201d take when literally EVERYTHING even down to the TITLE suggests that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.", "OMG you people are pathetic. Sorry your lives are so awful that \\*this\\* is what you think of first.\n\nI think that OP's wife is trying to deal with the impending loss of her husband who she loves (because OP hasn't told us any differently, and, you know, logic) and is raising children with. Including OP's oldest son. She wants to continue to be a mother to all her children. I would guess that losing the son at the same time as she loses her husband will feel like another death to her. IMO, she's being a bit insistent - perhaps overly so - as a way of processing the grief that comes with loss. THAT'S what I think of first, but hey, you do you.", "It for real sounds like it\u2019s the stepmom on and alt account cause it\u2019s ABSURD to think that you should have to force someone to stay in a place they don\u2019t want to because \u201cwhat if it hurts someone else\u201d", "This.  And the fact that she\u2019s calling OP an asshole or cold or whatever because he\u2019s worried about his son who has already lost his mother is a RED FLAG.  That\u2019s crazy to me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dying so how dare you try to work out specifics for your child rather than just do what I tell you to, you\u2019re the worst\u201d just seems so manipulative to me.", "Unfortunately, it's a possibility that must be considered. Step-monsters abound.", "It only supports the narrative that she's going through a shitton and not handling it well. She's not counting his money and cackling.", "Because she cares about him? And delusionally doesn't want to lose even more of OP?\n\nShe's not doing things right, but she's actively mourning the still happening death of her husband right before her eyes.\n\n>Plus I can\u2019t see her being a great step mother if after 10 years the son doesn\u2019t care for her. It doesn\u2019t sound like the son likes or respects her.\n\nBy OPs own admission, he moved on a bit too fast and son resisted the bond. It literally comes up in several AITA posts, even when the stepparent isn't overbearing."]}
