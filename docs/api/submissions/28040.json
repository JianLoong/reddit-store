THE TIME.\n\nShe snoozes her alarm at least three times every morning, then lays there going through her social media.\n\nEventually she gets up and takes a long ass shower, dresses (Which takes her forever, and she usually sits wrapped in a towel on her phone), then lingers over her coffee.  9 times out of 10 she's running late for work, and ends up speeding to make it on time.\n\nNaturally, she's gotten a number of speeding tickets.  I've tried to help her - eg putting her phone where she can't reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it, but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed.\n\nYou try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes even longer.  Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it.  A week goes by and sure enough, massive speeding fine in the mail.\n\nShe now has to hand in her drivers license because she's got so many demerit points, she'll be without one for 6 months.\n\nInstead of just dealing with it, she TELLS me \"I'll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don't lose my license\" and of course, I refused, telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding, and wake up earlier.\n\nThis argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded, then proceeds to tell me \"well, you'll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back\", and I tell her I won't be doing that - her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home, and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day.  She says it shouldn't matter as my work has flexible hours, but I stood my ground and refused, and said she can take public transport - there's literally a bus stop 2 mins walk from our house and the bus stops maybe 5 mins walk from her work, and it's quite regular,\n\nShe says she hates public transport and refuses to ride it, so I said then it's Uber for her, or organise a car pool, but bottom line, it's not my responsibility.\n\nShe called me an AH and is giving me the silent treatment, said a decent boyfriend would go to those lengths for her and that it's only 6 months.\n\nSo, am I AH for not \"saving her license\" and refusing to drive her to and from work for 6 months?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL,DR:  Gf is always running late, speeds to work, gets caught, loses license, expects me to cop the blame so she can keep her license, I Refuse, she then expects me to drive her to and from work but it's literally out of my way, says I'm the AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  We live in Brisbane, Australia for those wondering", "created_utc": 1696216402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xln17/aita_for_not_saving_my_gfs_drivers_license_and/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

IMO this is breakup worthy", "NTA honestly though, it sounds like she needs therapy to get to the root of her procrastination", "Sounds like you did the world a favour by taking your girlfriend off the road. She's going to get someone killed one day driving like that. \n\nNTA, your girlfriend is acting extremely entitled and lazy.", "She literally would pin her legal offenses on you. Wake up!  NTA", "OMG, is this idiot related to me? Sounds very familiar, hmmmm.\n\nRUN, RUN VERY FAST!", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend is a spoiled, entitled princess.

Unless she can clean the chrome off a trailer hitch, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re with her. \n\n.", "NTA Good for you for standing your ground.  She made the wrong choices and refused to change her problematic behavior despite many warnings because she just didn\u2019t want to make the effort or do things differently. Her choice to speed repeatedly as a solution is 100% on her. Losing your license is supposed to be a punishment for her, not you. Hold firm and continue to push back against the guilt and manipulation. She sounds a bit entitled and I have a feeling you are in for a fair amount of drama and whining while she adjusts.", "My wife is diagnosed with adhd, and does very simelar things as your gf. Everything is pushed to the absolute last second and almost always ends up with us leaving late. She cant find her keys most days and ends up rushing to work. She has received 2 speeding tickets in the last year.\n\nThis is the big difference.\n\nI hate being late, as someone who plans to show up atleast 10 minutes early for everything as i find being late for no good reason disrespectfull. Because she knows this and understands her \"time blindness\" isnt an excuse regardless of her adhd, so she asks me what time i want to leave instead of what time we should arrive. She trust me to figure out the timeline based on our experience.\n\nAlso very simelar to your issue her last ticket cause her a major issue with her drivers licence. (We are canadian) because her licence was transfered from a different provence, and drivers licences are given by the provence she had too many points and was forced to retake a drivers test, both the written and pratical test, it took her 3 times because it was mid winter with a crazy month of snow.\n\n At no point through this entirely frustrating point in life did she even mention any expectation from me. I had no issue taking her to the tests, and helped her understand how to read the bus schedual to get to work. Because she did everything she could herself i never thought twice about helping when possible, if i wasnt working id drive her to work, if i couldnt it wasnt even a second thought.\n\nShe owned up to her mistakes, accepted them and i wanted to help whenever possible because of that.\n\nIn your case your gf seems like she isnt willing to help herself, and expects you to fix it. Driving records can effect you for a long time. Explain to her that you are not trying to make her suffer, but you dont feel that she thinking of this situation beyond trying to push any reprocusions to you. Bring up the fact that you might have been willing to drive her to work, but her expectation/demand isnt how relationships work.\n\nTalk to her when youvare both calm. If she cant understand why you wont take the fall, and why expecting/demanding this from you because of her issues she seems to use as more of an excuse than something to work on. \n\nIf she cant understand that it doesnt really sound like someone you can build a life with", "NTA - she needs to learn consequences!

She'd have to be on time for them to work. A carpool or Uber isn't going to wait 20 minutes for you be be ready, and with a bus, you're working on their schedule.", "NTA time for her to grow up", "NTA - next will be she lost her job cause she can't be on time for the bus as they do follow a schedule.", "NTA, have to say if i was dumped back in to the dating pool at this stage, if a woman cant be on time, and respect mine or other peoples time i have none for hers.", "NTA. You are doing what any significant other who cares deeply would do, and taking a pretty hard road to do it. You are trying to address the root cause of the issue. Sounds like you are taking steps to avoid enabling her which would probably make things worse and hoping that this wake-up call will have an effect. She is worried about the current consequences and probably getting increasingly frustrated with the extra obstacles being added. You are worried about future potential consequences for her that could be far far worse, and maybe relieved it's only this. Same situation, with two very different perspectives.\n\nI can empathise with a lot of what you describe as her behaviour. Take a look at Consolations in Philosophy by Alain de Botton. The chapter on Seneca/frustration/expectations helped a lot and the book as a whole was an all-around good read. Maybe it will help here too. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nIt's time for her to suffer the consequences of her actions. If she was single and lived alone, what would she do?", "NTA. I used to be a habitually late person but I was never irresponsible enough to get speeding tickets about it! She fucked around, now she\u2019s finding out.", "Nta.   She knew exactly what she was doing. Now deal with those consequences.", "She isn't your child, she needs to grow up, buy since you know what type of person she is you cannot expect her to change so either except her as is or leave", "NTA\n\nBut ask yourself why you're with her.\n\nActions have consequences, she needs to learn this, not just fob them off onto someone else.", "Your girlfriend is TA.

She needs to handle the consequences of her own actions.\n\nHowever, what kind of AH would stay with a person like this? Contemptuous of anybody else's time, blames her faults on other people, is childish enough to use the silent treatment, etc. etc. Could I diffidently suggest therapy (for you)?", "NTA - hopefully her using public transport will teach her actions have consequences. Just be careful that she doesn\u2019t lose her job for missing the bus and being late. If you have given in then nothing would change. Things might go back to normal after 6 months but only time will tell.", "NTA. Don't drive her!!", "NTA. But you're in a relationship with a bratty teenager.", "NTA, she won't change and will make you late to work. Even though you have flexible hours they are probably used to you coming in by a certain time. Coming in 2 hours later might make you look bad. Not sure about your job but you may have meetings and might miss some cause you are driving her. She doesn't like public transportation well than don't lose your license and you would not be on this spot. You only have yourself to blame.", "NTA. She sounds pretty selfish and like she has no capacity to realise that there are consequences for her actions.", "NTA-a normal, logical person would not demand something like that. Is this a pattern of her personality? (not the lateness, but the entitlement and guilt-tripping). If so, she sucks. Let her learn her lesson. Maybe she will learn to be on time when she has to ride the bus.", "NTA.  Remind us - why are you in a relationship with this person?\n\nThere's gotta be a reason because it is not apparent at all in your post.", "My guy, did you read what you just posted? Why are you in this relationship? You have to know this won't get better at this point, she's showing no motivation to do better at all. You'll *have* to take this ticket.  You'll *have* to take me to work. Wow. \n\nAnd I hate to think how late she'd make you every day if you gave in--you have flexible hours they don't mind if you're 3 hours late, right?\n\nI try not to sing the Reddit dtmfa song at the slightest offense like many do... but I can only imagine how this sort of attitude bleeds over into how she handles everything. I'm exhausted *for* you.\n\nNTA", "NTA- esta loca \u2014 crazy peesony", "This doesn\u2019t ring true.
