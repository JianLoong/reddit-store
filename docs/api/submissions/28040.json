Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it.  A week goes by and sure enough, massive speeding fine in the mail.\n\nShe now has to hand in her drivers license because she's got so many demerit points, she'll be without one for 6 months.\n\nInstead of just dealing with it, she TELLS me \"I'll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don't lose my license\" and of course, I refused, telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding, and wake up earlier.\n\nThis argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded, then proceeds to tell me \"well, you'll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back\", and I tell her I won't be doing that - her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home, and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day.

She trust me to figure out the timeline based on our experience.\n\nAlso very simelar to your issue her last ticket cause her a major issue with her drivers licence. (We are canadian) because her licence was transfered from a different provence, and drivers licences are given by the provence she had too many points and was forced to retake a drivers test, both the written and pratical test, it took her 3 times because it was mid winter with a crazy month of snow.\n\n At no point through this entirely frustrating point in life did she even mention any expectation from me. I had no issue taking her to the tests, and helped her understand how to read the bus schedual to get to work.

Because her behavior now is draining - imagine if you had kids and not only was she late but she made them late for everything  getting them in trouble and imagine how that would mean you had to be responsible for 100% of getting them places as opposed to half the time and imagine her license revoked fully and you be the sole driver for the kids but also for her as you still need to everything done for the home.\n\nWithout kids - I'd not be able to cope with someone behaving like a teenager.

If caught, you could be charged with perverting the course of justice for saying you were driving when you weren't. Plus it would mean points/demerits or whatever the system is there on your license. \n\nAlso you didn't speed, she did, she needs to learn the consequences of her actions and put steps in place to improve the issue. If the issue is that she snoozes her alarm and then sits on her phone for ages, then the solution is to either have her phone somewhere she can't reach it from bed or even have her phone charge in another room and get a cheap alarm clock (again far enough away that she can't snooze it from bed.) This is kind of what you did, but this should be something you discussed with her and be willing to also do it yourself - moving her phone for her was never gonna work out. \n\nReddit's answer is always dump her, and that's not the first step but she is entitled and immature (the silent treatment is incredibly immature and can even be considered emotional abuse depending on the length and frequency she uses it.) and wants to take no responsibility for her actions. This is definitely a conversation you need to have with her, and if she doesn't change, then she shouldn't be surprised when her poor time keeping lets down friendships or gets her fired in the future.", "She has an addiction to her phone for one. She\u2019s also using it to deflect the negative feelings she has going on in her head and deflecting again on to you. \n\nI\u2019m glad you stood firm.

No one intentionally risks their employment, loses their drivers licence and throws money down the drain on missed flights. This probably also explains why she hates public transport - if you can't make yourself be there on time, public transport becomes impossible. \n\nYour gf needs to go to a doctor to figure out what's going on here, and if it turns out to be psychological she needs a therapist.\n\nIf she refuses to address the problem then you need to decide if you want your life to be like this long term. Your expectation that she can and should just stop being late overnight isn't realistic, she's going to need to put effort into changing and it will take time and support.", "NTA.
