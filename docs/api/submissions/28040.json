Always.  No matter if it's 5 mins up the road or catching a plane.\n\nBefore we get into it, no she isn't on the autism spectrum, she doesn't have ADHD or time blindness.\n\nShe just DAWDLES. ALL. THE TIME.\n\nShe snoozes her alarm at least three times every morning, then lays there going through her social media.\n\nEventually she gets up and takes a long ass shower, dresses (Which takes her forever, and she usually sits wrapped in a towel on her phone), then lingers over her coffee.  9 times out of 10 she's running late for work, and ends up speeding to make it on time.\n\nNaturally, she's gotten a number of speeding tickets.  I've tried to help her - eg putting her phone where she can't reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it, but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed.\n\nYou try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes even longer.  Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it.  A week goes by and sure enough, massive speeding fine in the mail.\n\nShe now has to hand in her drivers license because she's got so many demerit points, she'll be without one for 6 months.\n\nInstead of just dealing with it, she TELLS me \"I'll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don't lose my license\" and of course, I refused, telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding, and wake up earlier.\n\nThis argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded, then proceeds to tell me \"well, you'll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back\", and I tell her I won't be doing that - her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home, and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day.  She says it shouldn't matter as my work has flexible hours, but I stood my ground and refused, and said she can take public transport - there's literally a bus stop 2 mins walk from our house and the bus stops maybe 5 mins walk from her work, and it's quite regular,\n\nShe says she hates public transport and refuses to ride it, so I said then it's Uber for her, or organise a car pool, but bottom line, it's not my responsibility.\n\nShe called me an AH and is giving me the silent treatment, said a decent boyfriend would go to those lengths for her and that it's only 6 months.\n\nSo, am I AH for not \"saving her license\" and refusing to drive her to and from work for 6 months?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL,DR:  Gf is always running late, speeds to work, gets caught, loses license, expects me to cop the blame so she can keep her license, I Refuse, she then expects me to drive her to and from work but it's literally out of my way, says I'm the AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  We live in Brisbane, Australia for those wondering\n\n&#x200B;\n\nADD: Update in comments.", "created_utc": 1696216402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xln17/aita_for_not_saving_my_gfs_drivers_license_and/", "score": 1519, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because she knows this and understands her \"time blindness\" isnt an excuse regardless of her adhd, so she asks me what time i want to leave instead of what time we should arrive. She trust me to figure out the timeline based on our experience.\n\nAlso very simelar to your issue her last ticket cause her a major issue with her drivers licence. (We are canadian) because her licence was transfered from a different provence, and drivers licences are given by the provence she had too many points and was forced to retake a drivers test, both the written and pratical test, it took her 3 times because it was mid winter with a crazy month of snow.\n\n At no point through this entirely frustrating point in life did she even mention any expectation from me. I had no issue taking her to the tests, and helped her understand how to read the bus schedual to get to work. Because she did everything she could herself i never thought twice about helping when possible, if i wasnt working id drive her to work, if i couldnt it wasnt even a second thought.\n\nShe owned up to her mistakes, accepted them and i wanted to help whenever possible because of that.\n\nIn your case your gf seems like she isnt willing to help herself, and expects you to fix it.

She is worried about the current consequences and probably getting increasingly frustrated with the extra obstacles being added. You are worried about future potential consequences for her that could be far far worse, and maybe relieved it's only this.

People that behave like this do not respect anyone else around them, you included. She was a major AH for suggesting you take the speeding ticket. This is illegal. Her \u201cbetter late than dead on time\u201d doesn\u2019t include the people she could easily kill while speeding, does their life matter less than her extra minutes messing about on social media.

If she behaves like this over time management then she will be doing in other aspects of life", "If this was on the way to her work, all it would take for the cops to figure out the lie is a call to your workplace.

At first I was like \u201cwell sometimes those things can manifest differently, or maybe she is dealing with a strong need for escapism that keeps her in her phone all day and that need to escape is rooted in something else, or maybe\u2014\u201c but no. \n\nThis is just what it looks like when someone acts shitty and clearly feels entitled: entitled to other people\u2019s time, entitled to convenience, entitled to experiencing no consequences from her actions, just fucking entitled.

But unless she has lots of Uber money and a lenient boss or can magically really speed her morning routine tf up, she\u2019s gonna lose that job. Bus drivers and coworkers aren\u2019t gonna wait for her entitled ass and they sure as shit aren\u2019t going to wait and then speed to get there on time. \n\nOP you are definitely NTA.

Mate, that's a part time job for some! And for 26 weeks - that's 260 hours of your life you wouldn't get back.\n\nThere's a convenient public transport offering, but that's beneath her?\n\nYou told her to look into rideshare options, but that won't work as she's never on time and No One is going to wait for her late a$$ and be late to work as well. One week max is the most anyone would put up with such nonsense.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. Girl did this to herself.\n\nThere's a difference between a good partner/friend and an enabler. To me, it seems like you're trying to be the former and she thinks friendships or relationships mean you must be the latter.\n\nIt will do her good to stop looking down on public transit. Maybe in the interim she'll learn to be up and leave on time. If nothing else, maybe she'll stop speeding when she gets her license back.", "NTA, being on time is a choice and it is annoying as hell to always be waiting on someone and arriving late through no fault of your own. My wife is a chronic late person and it drives me nuts. I started leaving at a preset designated time and if she isn't ready she can take her own car. You reap what you sew...if you become her ride she will most likely continue to be late and you will also be late to work as a result.", "NTA, but if you really love her and intend to stay with her, id recommend having an intervention about the social media.    Those apps are custom made to appeal to the people with the most addictive personalities, and it sounds like she's using the dopamine feedback loop to detach from her own material wellbeing.", "She's also very selfish, demanding and entitled. She wants him to get in legal trouble because she can't wake up earlier. At best she inconviences others with her speeding, at worst she puts them in serious danger.

A bin chicken surely has better morals and more respect for you than she does. Put her in the bin where she belongs.", "This is a great point. OP\u2019s GF isn\u2019t going to magically start being on time if OP starts driving her to work.

Then she demands and tries to again guilt you into taking 2 hours a day to drive her to work when she can easily take public transit.  Yeah no.  Your GF is irresponsible, self centered and reckless.  It's probably a good thing she lost her license for now so she doesn't end of causing a huge accident in her mad rush to get to work.
