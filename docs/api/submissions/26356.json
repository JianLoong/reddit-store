They also occasionally come over separately or just a few of us will hang out, everyone generally gets fed in those situations too. \n\nThis is where the problem starts, my friend has now started talking about  \"the process\" of food being cooked.

This is better because I do save time on cooking I guess. However, when my friends have come over in the last week I still fed them because they were there without her.

Ok. NTA. your friend is just annoying.", "Why doesn't she act according to these beliefs?
