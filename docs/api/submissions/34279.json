Characters: me- 26 year old female. Chad- my fiance- 25 years old. Paul - Chads father- 55 years old. \n\nPaul texted Chad soon after we got engaged and told him that he would like a plus one to our wedding. Paul told Chad his plus one is 30 years old and that she really wants a signed baseball from Chad (Chad is a minor league pitcher lmao). Paul made Chad text this plus one to invite her based only on the above info \u201cfor brownie points\u201d ? Lol. Chad and I were kinda side eyeing this bc why is a 30 year old fan girling over her \u201cboyfriend\u2019s\u201d son and requesting a signed ball and a text from him ?\n\nThen I got on Facebook and looked up his plus one. Chad and I found out that Paul lied. the plus one is actually MARRIED and has 2 kids under the age of 4. She is ALSO 25 years old (3 months older than Chad and 1 year YOUNGER than me). \n\nWe didn\u2019t want to pry Paul for info or make him explain his relationship. So we told Paul that we didn\u2019t appreciate being manipulated and that we were no longer comfortable with this plus one coming bc we don\u2019t know her and our wedding wasn\u2019t the place to bring her into our intimate moment. I.e. photos, front row in the ceremony etc etc. \n\nPaul has now drug this topic on for 6 months of our engagement- he is not respecting our boundaries. He informed us his plus one is happily married and that the three of them are in the relationship (?). He\u2019s sold Chads things and forged Chad signature on an MLB check. And now Paul is not coming to our wedding bc his plus one isn\u2019t invited. So my fiance will not have a father at his wedding. AITA? Or are we the assholes \u2014?!\n\nAdding : Chad and I are very much on the same page here. Chad has done all of the communication with Paul. I have been super careful not to overstep Chad. I even told Chad - this situation is out of hand let\u2019s just let him bring her and Chad said absolutely not. Chad is embarrassed by his dad\u2019s actions. We are from the south, polygamy is not normal in the Bible Belt. Chad knows everyone will be weirded out if she comes. Again she\u2019s 3 months older than Chad.

It's one thing about the GF, but it's clear Paul's whole shtick is that his son is a minor league pitcher, and more importantly he was the one who got him there. Rather than supporting and cheering Chad on he's living vicariously through him. Yikes.\n\nYour wedding day, your rules, but please make sure to check in with Chad about all this. That can't be easy having a father like that.", ">Chad and I are very much on the same page here.\n\nThen it's all good. You are the ones getting married.\n\n>He\u2019s sold Chads things and forged Chad signature on an MLB check.\n\nChad needs to stop talking to Paul completely or things like this will continue for the rest of his life.", "Ok, so your soon to be FIL is gonna boycott your wedding-and not bring his little polyamorous GF either.

Not acceptable.", "NTA but police need to be involved", "Every time I think I've seen the most extreme AITA of the OP burying the lede, the next OP outdoes the last.\n\nWhat are you TALKING about, should we allow a plus one? How do you just drop at the end that his dad is stealing from him and forging his signature???\n\nUsually plus ones are plus ones, and a 55-year-old bringing a 25yo girlfriend is gross but not unheard of. The term \"midlife crisis\" is well known for a reason. As to her other friendly, I doubt it would ever come up, and for all you know there are other wedding guests bringing their mistresses as well. You shouldn't gatekeep plus ones.\n\nBut there is clearly sooooo much more to this story that is not part of this post. Ultimately, it's up to you as the wedding party to decide who is invited to the wedding. Since Chad says his dad is not welcome, this is an easy NTA but Paul's gf is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg", "INFO: I notice \\*you\\* Googled but you use \"we\" for the decision-making.

How does Chad feel about you excluding his father's GF AND his father therefore not attending?\n\nN-T-A if Chad's happy with this arrangement.\n\nY-T-A if Chad's not and you're letting your issues with Paul or his GF harm your fiance's big day. Chad should be the primary decision-maker on who attends on his side of the aisle.

Was it a souvenir check or an actual MLB paycheck?\n\nCuz if he is forging his son's signature on stuff and selling it as authentic Chad signed gear, that's fraud. Besides illegal, it can actually hurt Chad's baseball career if he does not take action. MLB (and any other major sports league) has a whole security unit whose sole job is to track down people selling fraudulent MLB memorabilia, such as stuff with forged signatures. And they hold players responsible if the player knows it's going on. Chad might be contractually obligated to notify his team and MLB about this situation with his dad selling fraudulent gear.", "Tea. I think you\u2019re right. A lot has gone on in between this as well.

It's very possible Chad would actually be happier without such a toxic person in his life.", "You know, I arranged to visit my wife's parents until she told me \"I always feel bad when I visit.\"  I always want things to be \"fair\" and we see my family a lot.  It might be time to listen to Chad and figure out exactly what he is comfortable with here, then support that.  Poor Chad, he certainly didn't win the dad lottery.", "Don\u2019t advocate for something that is irreparably broken.  Is Chad pressing charges on his dad for forging his signature?

Chad's father sounds like a dick for a lot of other reasons, but his romantic life isn't for you to judge and your attitude toward polyamory is childish and insulting. ESH", "NTA. I mean, I\u2019m more concerned that you future FIL apparently regularly commits felonies like forgery and fraud. Seems more worrisome than his embarrassing dating habits.", "NTA. \n\nBut this -- He\u2019s sold Chads things and forged Chad signature on an MLB check -- wasn't enough to get him uninvited?"]}
