My sister (Jane) is pregnant and this trip is their babymoon.\n\nJane's husband (Charles); My husband 31M (Victor)\n\nBackground - I don't like how Charles speaks to or treats Jane in general. Charles often argues and raises his voice at Jane throughout the day about trivial things.  I've talked to Jane about his behavior before and she's told me, \"I realize how he sounds when he talks to people; we fight about it all the time\" and \"I think he needs anger management.\" It always ends with her apologizing or making excuses.\n\nWeekend 1: The entire time we spent with Charles was quite exhausting and miserable for me. He argued with my sister multiple times. When Victor speaks, I can see Charles rolling his eyes, nudging Jane's elbow, and \"whispering\" snide remarks to her; he seems to think these all go unnoticed by us. He usually talks down to me, cuts me off, and enjoys flaunting his knowledge. My brother, mom, and some cousins also find him a difficult person to be around.\n\nCharles and Jane leave my house and the next day I am overwhelmed by the stress and how uncomfortable Charles always makes me feel. Victor finds me crying and thinks they should not come back to sleep in our home because it is so stressful for me, but agrees we should still hang out with them out of our house. I cried about it because I don't want to put my sister in a difficult situation, especially with her being pregnant and trying to enjoy a vacation. \n\nI end up telling Jane how I feel: \"Charles is rude/disrespectful to you, me, and Victor. I still want to spend time with you while you're in town, but I need separate time to decompress after being with Charles. I love you but this is the boundary I need to set for this dynamic to work.\"\n\nShe cries and says if she doesn't sleep here, she will \"need a break\" from me.\n\nI apologized to her and emphasized this is about needing a break from Charles, not Jane. (both during a phone call and text)\n\nCharles calls me and it goes terribly. He talks over me. He tells me he is \"disappointed\" because I am \"not supporting\" my sister's pregnancy by not allowing him to sleep at my place. \"Jane is bringing life into this world. Our feelings aren't what matter, Jane is what matters right now. If we don't sleep there, we won't be seeing you.\"\n\nWeekend 2 starts today. I haven't heard from Jane.

He usually talks down to me, cuts me off\n\nSeriously, why isn't anyone calling him out on this behavior? \n\n\"Charles, we can see and hear you, you are being rude.\"\n\n\"I was talking, please don't interrupt me\"\n\n\"Do not talk to me in that way, it is rude\".\n\nHe does this because everyone lets him.", "NTA\n\nCharles is abusive. \n\nKeep the door open for your sister.", "NTA, but I think some commenters are missing an important point. It sounds as if Jane is being abused by her husband, and possibly isolated. If you want to be strategic in a way that enables you to be there for your sister and your incoming nibling, you might try being neutral with Charles and ensuring your sister knows she can always come to you. This might involve a bit of BSing your way through the Charles minefields, but it might wind up really helping your sister down the line.\n\nSo, instead of telling your sister her husband can't stay at your house, just don't be available to host either of them, but for a neutral reason, like \"we're just hosted out at the moment.\" When you make it about Charles you put your sister in the position of either defending him or rejecting him, but she might not be ready to reject him now, so she digs in deeper to her position and becomes more isolated with her possible abuser.\n\nHonestly, I think it's going to be difficult for almost anyone in a marriage to accept \"you can stay at my place but your spouse can't.\" It's just too far out of the norm for someone who seems to be trying, for better or worse, to make their marriage work.\n\nNow that the cat is out of the bag already, you might need to backtrack a bit if you want to try this strategy - you could contact your sister and say that you are sorry, you spoke out of turn and didn't mean to sound like you were rejecting her husband. Just say you can't have them visit now for some other reason, but that you really want to spend time with her (them).\n\nAlso, please note, I am NOT saying that you should abandon your boundary around having her husband at your house. He sound awful and that's a perfectly reasonable boundary. I am saying, if you want to be there for your sister, finesse it a bit so you can maintain your relationship with her and be there when she needs you, but also respect your own need for privacy and freedom from her obnoxious husband.\n\nETA - my father was like Charles, and we wound up being isolated from my mom's side of the family as a result. Until the end of her life one of my aunts would talk about a miserable visit they had with my parents. The visits stopped and my sibs and I missed out on knowing our cousins, and maybe having had enough of a support system to have gotten away from my abusive father. If you can find a way, please keep the channels open with your sister.", "NTA\n\nBut this outcome is not surprising.  Very few married people would be willing to sleep apart from their spouse on vacation, especially in entirely different places.  Even less when one party is nearing the end of a pregnancy.  Spouses like to share accommodations, and any time you're trying to split a married couple up in terms of sleeping arrangements, there's always a very good chance they will both decide to make alternate arrangements elsewhere so they can stay together.  \n\nYou're not an AH for setting boundaries with your sister's shitty husband, but married couples often see themselves as a unit and they may not allow you to set boundaries with only one of them while keeping the other in your life.  That's your sister's choice: she's siding with her husband.  She's not going to stay where he's not welcome.  She's not going to hang out with people who are on bad terms with him.  And it's her right to draw her own boundary with people who do not welcome her husband, as misguided as we might think that is.  Hopefully in the future she will relent, but if she holds firm, you may need to decide how much Charles you are willing to tolerate to have your sister in your life.", "NTA. You are much to kind to say your sister and her husband were \u201cvisiting\u201d you only to use your home to save hotel expense so I\u2019ll say it for you.", "NTA.  Since when has he been the authority on putting Jane\u2019s feelings first?  He\u2019s just bitter he has to pay for accommodation", "NTA. You handled everything with grace and more patience than most would have.  I have a feeling the \"fights\" your sister claims to have with Charles over his behavior aren't happening the way she tells you and she probably wouldn't dare to make the suggestion of anger management to him. \n\nIf he had given you the opportunity to actually speak instead of talking over you, I would have said something along the lines of, \" I agree, Jane and her feels are what matter. And yet, you speak to her like trash and treat her family with no respect.  You are the one who doesn't support, Jane.\"", "NTA\u2026but I do think you could have done things differently:\n\n1) From the way you worded it here, it does sound like you may have uninvited her. I might have said explicitly \u201cYou are welcome to stay here but Charles is not\u201d\n\n2) There\u2019s certainly no requirement, but given that this return stay was already planned, you might have considered allowing them to stay this time with some stipulations on Charles\u2019 behavior.\n\nThis is a shitty situation since you obviously don\u2019t want to harm your relationship with your sister but shouldn\u2019t have to deal with her AH husband either", "NTA, but keep a channel open to Jane, no matter what.", "NTA\n\n This is you unwilling to endure more abuse from your brother in law. Abuse at you, your sister, your husband. This man sounds toxic.\n\nYou could reaffirm to Jane that she is welcome but Charles is not.", "NTA Next time Chuck calls, hang up. You don't have to listen to his crap. Jane chooses to; you don't. Tell her when she is willing to look for better company, you're around.", "Ooh, you should have told him, \"If Jane's feelings are what matters, you wouldn't be such a dick to her and everyone else.\"\n\nDon't let him gaslight you into thinking you're in the wrong when he's the one causing the issues.", "NTA\nBut I would reach out to your sister, a lot of narcissists do this to their spouses families to essentially get them cut off. So maybe be more specific that you still want a relationship with her on her own but that you just find her husbands behaviour too much to handle.", "He's verbally abusive to your sister (and also to you,) and now he's isolating her. Reach out to her to let her know you are always there for her, because it could get worse for her after this baby is born.\n\nYou are NTA for disallowing a terrible petson to stay in your home.", "NTA you set a boundary and if they dont want to respect it then that is their choice. I'm sure it must be so hard for you as that is your sister but it sounds like she's in a toxic relationship and needs to realize that on her own. That is your home though and you should feel safe, comfortable and respected in your OWN home.", "NTA at all.  Charles is abusive and a narcissist.  I only hope that Jane realizes that he's never going to get better and leaves him before he emotionally scars their child.", "NTA!!  \nCharles says \"Our feelings aren't what matter, Jane is what matters right now.\"   \nIn that case, perhaps he could modify his obnoxious behavior to make his presence more palatable. He sounds insufferable.", "NTA - Tell him that Jane is welcome, but he is not.  If Jane and her pregnancy are what \"really matters\" then he should have no problem.  But he will have a problem because it's really all about him.", "NTA. Your sister has a problem with your boundaries and that\u2019s her problem along with the ah she married -not yours. You made it clear that you were upset by the unacceptable behavior and the disrespect continued.", "NTA\n\nHe's rude, inconsiderate, and a jerk. The last place you should be stressed is in your home. If he calls and talks over you/interrupts you/insults you just hang up on him. Send him a text saying that when he is ready to be an adult and have a respectful, adult conversation he can call. Until then, Jane is welcome in your home, but he and his attitude problem are not.", "Why would you let a rude person like that in your house let alone sleep there?  NTAH.", "NTA", "NTA. You're entitled to boundaries to maintain your mental health in your own household.      \nI'm divided on if Jane is the AH because on one hand it feels like she laid down an ultimatum but ultimately she is entitled to her boundaries too.", "\u201cYes Charles, Jane is who matters here. So why don\u2019t you put alon a smile and play nice for your wife. The reason she isn\u2019t staying here is because she doesn\u2019t want to stay alone. Your behavior has stepped over the line, you know how you have been acting and that is the reason you can not stay at my home. I hope that you can put Jane first and try and act decent\u201d", "Definitely NTA but I have no advice on how to proceed going forward. I'm so sorry things have gotten to this point.", "Nta", "Charles will not change until your sister gives him hard consequences. He has to want to see what you all are seeing and make changes for himself first. NTA.. good luck with your sister", "Absolutely NTA\n\nSince your feelings don't matter, they shouldn't be bothered to stay somewhere else", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She cries and says if she doesn't sleep here, she will \"need a break\" from me.\" .. this is the best solution all around.", "INFO\n\n> this trip is their babymoon.\n\n... what the shit is a \"babymoon?\"", "Nta. You were honest. Your home is your temple. And he disturbs that. Just because she\u2019s pregnant doesn\u2019t mean he gets to disrupt your peace because he can\u2019t behave like a decent human being", "Tf is a babymoon?", "If Jane is what matters, Charles needs to stop being such an asshole to his wife and her family. NTA", "NTA", "Nta so instead of Charles be better for his pregnant wife he immediately blamed you? \n\nKeep the boundary", "NTA - Your poor sister.  Nobody should be rude to their hosts.  Charles should apologize to you and your husband and find a place to stay because I don't think he's going to change his stripes. This is off topic but I never understood how people could enjoy \"relaxing\" when they go somewhere on vacation. It's always stressful. But Charles makes everything stressful with his rudness . . .", "NTA. I wouldn't want to host someone like that either. Just make sure Jane knows she can come to you when she is finally able to make the decision to leave Charles.", "NTA\n\nCharles is an ass. His behavior is unacceptable.\n\nYou need to tell him to: shut up and listen, that he is behaving like an ass, and you will not accept his behavior in your home. If he doesnt like this, to bad. \n\nYou have to make it clear in no uncertain terms that you do not accept how he treats your sister. Do not let him speak, as it sounds like he is just trying to put it on you. Point out that you see and hear his snide remarks. He needs to learn to be respectful to others.\n\nIm sorry your sister is having a kid with somebody like this.", "NTA Good on you for maintaining a boundary but don\u2019t lose touch with Jane.", "How else are they supposed to learn if people keep enabling this? Enjoy the break. One day Jane will wise up and you\u2019ll be there for her.
