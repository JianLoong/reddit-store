They come to visit us each year for one week to spend time with us and our 2 kids. Obviously, i do my best to make them feel at home and the more comfortable possible.\n\nLast year, there has been an incident between my wife and my parents about something completely meaningless, but it was the first time so i let it go.\n\nThis year, there was a second one, and i decided to get mad. We have a few problems in our house, we've had mold that we are treating, we have issues of flooding on our terrace and we have a broken window that we're not allowed to open or it won't close and some other minor stuff.\n\nWe've given a few instructions to my parents about our home as they were staying alone when we had to go to work. one of them was to open the windows for a while during the day (to treat our mold issue) and to let that particular window closed because it's broken.\n\nOne day, while we were both to work, my mother ventilated the house by opening the windows and she opened by mistake that particular broken window.\n\nMy wife got home before me and sent me a text : \"Your mother opened the window, it's broken\". Well, i thought and said... Shit happens. She obviously didn't do it on purpose. It's a problem sure, because it's cold outside, but it's ok, we'll call someone to fix it.\n\nSo when I came home i asked my mother what happened with the window. She said she opened it by mistake. I tried to minimize the problem as i saw my mother feeling guilty. I told her it's ok, we have a lot of problem in this house, it's an honest mistake. At that moment my wife took my remark as a critic to her, thinking i meant she doesn't do anything to take care of her home (which was absolutely not my attention). My mother said she didn't hear that particular instruction from my wife when she explained all the different instructions to her. That's where my wife lost it and said : \"Of course, you never listen anything that i say, you're just like your son, now i'll have to do all the calls to repair it, it's gonna cost us money etc\" in a very agressive tone. I was upset because she \"insulted\" my mother, raised her voice toward her, which i thought was a mark of disrespect, as i would never ever do that to a guest in my house.\n\nI went outside to calm down. My wife came to me and started to yell at me : \"how can you criticize our home in front of your parents ? How does it make me look ? How can you not be on my side ?\" i told her it was never my intention to criticize her, listing problems in the house has nothing to do with her and i told her i was upset, i told her she has been disrepectful, rude, shameful.\n\nShe stands on the fact that if she yelled at my parents it was my fault. I feel like it's just an excuse to clear herself. Now she's mad at me for not taking her side.", "created_utc": 1674211073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gtpy2/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_was_rude_and/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Omg, it isn't even close. If you both work full time, you need a huge damn wake up call.

You may say you do your fair share of the work, but I doubt it.\nMaybe it's even true about the housework and the kids. But is it true about the responsibility? And especially the sense of responsibility? You say that your mother is very judgmental about the cleanliness of the house and that your wife puts a lot of pressure on herself because of that, even though you tell her that the house doesn't have to be spotless. But the problem is that it does have to be spotless, because otherwise your wife feels judged by your mother. And let's be honest: your mother is more likely to judge your wife than you if the house is dirty.\n\nYou also say that she takes care of the house repairs more than you do. Mainly because she \"prefers to do the job herself\". I can tell you why that is: because she doesn't trust you to do it as well and reliably. And because it is probably easier for her to do everything quickly herself than to \"hand over\" the work to you.\n\nI have exactly the same problem with my boyfriend. We live in a flat together that needs a lot of renovation and we are building a house. I have to take care of everything. We had a craftsman there while I was on a business trip and I had to send my boyfriend a list with everything he has to discuss with the craftsman. Because without this list he would have forgotten half of it. And yes, in that situation he did more than me measured in hours - but all the responsibility and invisible work I had to do. And who called the craftsman because he didn't send the estimate in time???\n\nWe ordered a kitchen together. There are delivery problems. We both have the same access to the contract and contact info. Yesterday he asked me when the kitchen would finally arrive, if there was any new information. Do you think he would have thought of contacting the dealer himself? No, he asked me because he assumed that I would take care of it.\n\nThat's exhausting. And yes, sometimes I get stroppy \"for no reason\". Because I just can't take it any more. And if I were you, I would think about whether the situation is similar for you and your wife.\n\nIn this situation, it would have been better to say: \"This can happen, I've already called the someone, he'll fix it the day after tomorrow.\n\nBy saying that a lot of the house is broken, you only reminded your wife of all the work she still has to do.", "YTA.\n\nAfter reading, it seems you seem to care more about your mothers emotions rather than your wife\u2019s.\n\nYou mentioned you could tell your mother felty guilty and validated that emotion of hers. You never mention that you could see your wife\u2019s frustration. You were more upset she was mad at your mother for something very valid than understanding that this is an added stress to your wife.\n\nLike other commenters have mentioned, you really need to have a sit down convo with your wife. You aren\u2019t on the same page about things and she may feel her emotions are put on the back burner for your mothers.\n\nHope things gets better and you start paying more attention to how some things affect your wife rather than how you think they should affect her.", "ESH. Oh, so *now* you can call someone to fix the defective window after your mother forgot/disregarded instructions to not open it and completely broke it, no big deal? OP, I don\u2019t know about the financial difficulties and pressures you and your wife are under \u2014 it sounds like they are many \u2014 but she sounds extraordinarily stressed out and frustrated. Yes, she should have tamped down her anger at the window being broken.  Your wife apparently internalizes and feels not only ashamed and blamed for the house being in disrepair and who knows, maybe she is too stingy to budget for repairs.  btw, your comment to her last year that \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019, you got the dish soap \u2018on sale\u2019 was a dismissive crack about her frugal penny pinching shopping whether you admit it to yourself or not.", "ESH.\n\nI don't believe your mother didn't hear your wife said not to open the window.

It could be equal participation, but it could also be those things were done by someone in the household and I'm part of the household so \"we\" did them.
