They come to visit us each year for one week to spend time with us and our 2 kids. Obviously, i do my best to make them feel at home and the more comfortable possible.\n\nLast year, there has been an incident between my wife and my parents about something completely meaningless, but it was the first time so i let it go.\n\nThis year, there was a second one, and i decided to get mad. We have a few problems in our house, we've had mold that we are treating, we have issues of flooding on our terrace and we have a broken window that we're not allowed to open or it won't close and some other minor stuff.\n\nWe've given a few instructions to my parents about our home as they were staying alone when we had to go to work. one of them was to open the windows for a while during the day (to treat our mold issue) and to let that particular window closed because it's broken.\n\nOne day, while we were both to work, my mother ventilated the house by opening the windows and she opened by mistake that particular broken window.\n\nMy wife got home before me and sent me a text : \"Your mother opened the window, it's broken\". Well, i thought and said... Shit happens. She obviously didn't do it on purpose. It's a problem sure, because it's cold outside, but it's ok, we'll call someone to fix it.\n\nSo when I came home i asked my mother what happened with the window. She said she opened it by mistake. I tried to minimize the problem as i saw my mother feeling guilty. I told her it's ok, we have a lot of problem in this house, it's an honest mistake. At that moment my wife took my remark as a critic to her, thinking i meant she doesn't do anything to take care of her home (which was absolutely not my attention). My mother said she didn't hear that particular instruction from my wife when she explained all the different instructions to her. That's where my wife lost it and said : \"Of course, you never listen anything that i say, you're just like your son, now i'll have to do all the calls to repair it, it's gonna cost us money etc\" in a very agressive tone. I was upset because she \"insulted\" my mother, raised her voice toward her, which i thought was a mark of disrespect, as i would never ever do that to a guest in my house.\n\nI went outside to calm down. My wife came to me and started to yell at me : \"how can you criticize our home in front of your parents ? How does it make me look ? How can you not be on my side ?\" i told her it was never my intention to criticize her, listing problems in the house has nothing to do with her and i told her i was upset, i told her she has been disrepectful, rude, shameful.\n\nShe stands on the fact that if she yelled at my parents it was my fault. I feel like it's just an excuse to clear herself. Now she's mad at me for not taking her side.", "created_utc": 1674211073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gtpy2/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_was_rude_and/", "score": 711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Omg, it isn't even close. If you both work full time, you need a huge damn wake up call.

You may say you do your fair share of the work, but I doubt it.\nMaybe it's even true about the housework and the kids. But is it true about the responsibility? And especially the sense of responsibility? You say that your mother is very judgmental about the cleanliness of the house and that your wife puts a lot of pressure on herself because of that, even though you tell her that the house doesn't have to be spotless. But the problem is that it does have to be spotless, because otherwise your wife feels judged by your mother. And let's be honest: your mother is more likely to judge your wife than you if the house is dirty.\n\nYou also say that she takes care of the house repairs more than you do. Mainly because she \"prefers to do the job herself\". I can tell you why that is: because she doesn't trust you to do it as well and reliably. And because it is probably easier for her to do everything quickly herself than to \"hand over\" the work to you.\n\nI have exactly the same problem with my boyfriend. We live in a flat together that needs a lot of renovation and we are building a house. I have to take care of everything. We had a craftsman there while I was on a business trip and I had to send my boyfriend a list with everything he has to discuss with the craftsman. Because without this list he would have forgotten half of it. And yes, in that situation he did more than me measured in hours - but all the responsibility and invisible work I had to do. And who called the craftsman because he didn't send the estimate in time???\n\nWe ordered a kitchen together. There are delivery problems. We both have the same access to the contract and contact info. Yesterday he asked me when the kitchen would finally arrive, if there was any new information. Do you think he would have thought of contacting the dealer himself? No, he asked me because he assumed that I would take care of it.\n\nThat's exhausting. And yes, sometimes I get stroppy \"for no reason\". Because I just can't take it any more. And if I were you, I would think about whether the situation is similar for you and your wife.\n\nIn this situation, it would have been better to say: \"This can happen, I've already called the someone, he'll fix it the day after tomorrow.\n\nBy saying that a lot of the house is broken, you only reminded your wife of all the work she still has to do.", "YTA.\n\nAfter reading, it seems you seem to care more about your mothers emotions rather than your wife\u2019s.\n\nYou mentioned you could tell your mother felty guilty and validated that emotion of hers. You never mention that you could see your wife\u2019s frustration. You were more upset she was mad at your mother for something very valid than understanding that this is an added stress to your wife.\n\nLike other commenters have mentioned, you really need to have a sit down convo with your wife. You aren\u2019t on the same page about things and she may feel her emotions are put on the back burner for your mothers.\n\nHope things gets better and you start paying more attention to how some things affect your wife rather than how you think they should affect her.", "ESH. Oh, so *now* you can call someone to fix the defective window after your mother forgot/disregarded instructions to not open it and completely broke it, no big deal? OP, I don\u2019t know about the financial difficulties and pressures you and your wife are under \u2014 it sounds like they are many \u2014 but she sounds extraordinarily stressed out and frustrated. Yes, she should have tamped down her anger at the window being broken.  Your wife apparently internalizes and feels not only ashamed and blamed for the house being in disrepair and who knows, maybe she is too stingy to budget for repairs.  btw, your comment to her last year that \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019, you got the dish soap \u2018on sale\u2019 was a dismissive crack about her frugal penny pinching shopping whether you admit it to yourself or not.", "ESH.\n\nI don't believe your mother didn't hear your wife said not to open the window.

We'll just fix it.\"  If it's no big deal then why has the window gone for so long without being fixed???   \nI have a feeling your wife has been asking for help and you keep putting off repairing/helping.  And now that your family is here, she is embarassed by the state of the house.", "YTA", "NTA -  maybe it would have been advisable to either have repaired the window beforehand or to have something wedged in to make it way too difficult to just open.\nWIFE TA - probably just under the pressure of trying to keep on good grades with the in-laws and snapped.. send her for some relaxation and you take care of getting the repair done.", "NAH - your wife took this personally which it sounds like is understandable given that she feels you don't step up to help around the house. That resentment will naturally build until she sees the state of the home as an extension of herself and the ignorance of your mother as an extension of yours. You two needed to address that issue long before it got to this stage, but all you have is now so definitely address it going forward. \n\nYour mom may have expressed guilt implicitly in her tone or body language, but I don't remember reading you say she apologized to your wife. I think an apology can go a really long way.\n\nYou need to step tf up at home for sure, but I do commend your attempt to manage your own frustration by walking away and taking deep breaths. That's a good start. Now go to your wife and apologize for making her feel alone in her frustrations over and work to maintain your home that you also live in. And ask her how you can be better at making her feel heard going forward, and also start listening to your wife.", "Well... INFO: Is she right? Will your wife be the one who has to fix the broken window?\n\nIt's a pretty AH thing to console your mother that her mistake isn't that bad, but then put the work of fixing it on your wife. It's disingenuous to accept an apology if you're not the one who was hurt.\n\nYour wife's reaction also seems like there is more to this than you let on. What happened a year ago? Are you actually doing anything to make your parents comfortable or is that also your wife's job? Since she was the one giving instructions, I'm pretty sure you don't do much around the house.\n\nAnd the comment about you never listening is telling.

NTA\n\non another note you said you only see them once a year and your wife doesn\u2019t seem to be able to put her differences aside for one week for such a small incident.

It would likely take the tension and stress out of the visit for everyone involved.", "ESH.\n\nYou suck for trying to minimize your wife's frustrations. By your comments, it seems like this isn't the first time that you've tried to defend your parents after they do something that costs you guys money.\n\nYour wife, however, is the bigger AH by far. She sucks because it seems like she's trying to find an insult in everything you say.  It's also an asshole move to yell at your MIL over something like this.

They seem pretty equal to me, but neither is something to get too mad about.  It could be that your parents actually don't listen to what your wife says. Why didn't you yourself tell your parents about all the windows? \n\nI'm dying of curiosity, though. If you and your wife both work, who opens the windows when your parents aren't there to be given the chore? Also, why wasn't the broken window fixed? Did you yourself call to get the window fixed, or did you leave it to your wife, as she expected?\n\nI want to throw something out, though.  Given that it is both your house and your wife's house, in the future, it would be best if your parents stayed elsewhere. Also, it would make sense that you give your parents any future instructions, which would avoid future conflicts or make them conflicts with you.", "I suspect that if your parents/mother truly viewed you and you wife as a unified front, then a simple request to skip opening a broken window would have been heeded with no problem. I think you should take the reins on getting the window fixed asap and make a show of it to your parents so they understand that if they are flippant towards your wife, then you will notice and react. \n\nYta, because if you and your wife open your home to anyone, and that includes parents, your guests should know and respect what\u2019s off limits to them.

You're kind of expecting her to be a gracious host to your guests and to be generous on your behalf. You really should be generous towards her and grateful that she is making space for your family.\n\nIn your story, when your wife texted you, you should have apologized to her on your mom's behalf and thanked her for her patience with the situation. It's not \"shit happens,\" it's \"I messed up and let my guests make a mistake and my wife is now suffering for it. I owe her an apology.\" Your family's visit has made her life more difficult. You should have also committed to a timeline within which *you* would get the window fixed. When you minimized the problem to make your mom feel better, your wife heard minimizing her inconvenience for your benefit.\n\nAlso, why did your wife give your mom the instructions in the first place? She's your guest and you should have taken responsibility for making sure she kept the window closed in the first place. Of course, you should have put in a screw to make it impossible to open and left a label on it as a reminder. If you were approaching the visit from a perspective of \"these are my guests and I need to make this visit as easy as possible for my wife, who is already being more than generous by accepting my family in her home and should not be expected to endure any unnecessary inconveniences,\" you might have thought of that. Also, btw, you should be doing any extra cleaning for your parents, including changing sheets and washing their used sheets and towels after they leave.

I just sigh and add dish soap to my grocery list, but I\u2019m screaming in my head.", "It\u2019s in the comments, something about his mom using too much dish soap and OP replacing it with dish soap that was too expensive.", "I mean it\u2019s probably somewhere in between lol", "You don\u2019t get mad easily. Based on your wife\u2019s reactions to both you and your parents- thinking she\u2019s being criticized- what you think are normal comments are actually what most people will view as criticism. Then you dismiss her when she tells you how she feels. You guys need to stop hosting your parents for a while and get into marriage counseling. Either you are criticizing her and you think she needs to let it roll off her or you suck at communicating with your wife. Until it\u2019s fixed and your marriage is stronger, hosting your parents will cause more friction in your marriage.", "It 100% is my friend. You should never feel ashamed for taking your mums side if she was in the right. As long a if the roles were reversed you would have sided with your wife", "I edited my comment to further explain OPs comments.", "Or maybe she can just check in  with the mirror for a little bit and realize it ain't always about you.", "The lack of communication is weird, for sure.\n\n>Seems like you have determined the wife is horrible off only the information that the op provided that is biased as he only saw/heard the final result.\n\nCorrect, that's all we have, I make judgements based on the information I have, not on made-up fanfic. Even reading between the lines doesn't indicate the parents are dicks. Again, I'm not saying the wife is definitely the issue, just that based on the information provided, that's what it looks like.\n\n>It is correct that dish soap is relatively inexpensive so why is she so upset? If she is normally a calm and reasonable individual that would lead one to believe that something else is going on\n\n\"she is normally a calm and reasonable individual\" where is that stated?\nHave you never met a person who was unreasonable? Like it's not out of the realm of possibilities that the wife is unreasonable and believes every comment, look, movement, is an attack. There are many people like this.", "congrats!", "Sounds like she already had a child.", "I didn't see this one. He's definitely TA now. The MIL respects a kept house over everything else. Him bringing up issues with the house in front of his mother only makes the wife look like a bad partner.", ">Your wife either has to: make the time to obsessively clean so your mom is comfortable, or deal with silent judgment from your mother about her housekeeping skills.\n\nOr his wife can also just do her thing. As far as I can tell, nobody is saying anything bad to her, she's just got issues and is taking them out on the in-laws.\n\n>But he doesn't get to feel the \"bad wife\" vibes from them.\n\nAre the vibes from them or from inside your head?\n\n>You know your mom is going home thinking \"I don't know how she can stand keeping her house so dirty\", and your wife knows it too.\n\nOr she could be thinking \"I wonder if that chicken place will be open when we get home\". I'm obsessively clean and tidy. Unless you are inviting me to sit on a fresh stain, I don't care about your housekeeping skills. I don't carry white gloves in my pocket and I don't sneakily check if you dusted the picture frames this morning. Just because you feel judged doesn't mean you are.\n\n>Your mom using a ton of dish soap highlighted how dirty she thinks everything is. \n\nOr she just uses a lot of dish soap. I mean, this is absurd, dish soap is used for dirty dishes. How clean do you expect dirty dishes to be that someone using more dish soap than you would make you feel bad?!", "Thank you!  I have a similar MIL but my husband registers her passive aggressive remarks and actions and removes them from the house when he also sees I'm about to start screaming.

People here just cannot fathom that a young woman should be blamed... she must be the victim of some kind of slight...\n\n... until she older, and especially if she has raised a son... then suddenly she becomes the evil MIL whose humanity goes by the wayside as she is now just something interfering with wife's needs/domination of husband and household.\n\nDownvote...
