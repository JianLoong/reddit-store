Our youngest, 9 years old, has ADHD, autism, and PTSD. Obviously there's a fair bit of psychiatric, therapy, and doctor appointments involved, as well as school IEP meetings, etc, etc, etc. My boys are blessed to have a generally good stepmom with 2 major caveats- she does not know when to shut up and let the custodial parents speak and she thinks that her Google search knowledge is sufficient to constantly try to discount/call into question the autism diagnosis, med choices, my parenting choices, school accommodations, and so on. \n\n  I have talked to my ex about this repeatedly. I've tried to be nice, but I done ran out of patience the other night when she showed up with my ex to a psychiatry med check and insisted on arguing that my special needs son's recent behavior problems are my fault and the schools fault, that the psychiatrist was wrong for wanting to increase his meds since he has grown, and that the medication to help him sleep through the night needed to be taken away for his safety. I finally completely lost it and said \"You have no power here\" in my best possessed Theoden voice. \n\n  I went on to tell her that she is nothing more than a stepmother with no legal custodial rights. Her name is not even on the custody arrangement. Whether she likes it or not, she will never be the parent in the same way that I or their father are. She will never have the same authority, because my boys already have two parents and we didn't cease to be their actual parents simply  because we got divorced.\n\n  I'm generally laid back, so the room got quiet. I think everyone was stunned. I didn't yell, though I did get louder than usual. There was no cussing. I've just had enough. Afterwards the psychiatrist spoke to me privately about how step parents are parents, blah, blah, blah. She agreed that the stepmother was out of line, but she thought I was equally out of line. But here's the thing, I don't even have to let this woman in the room. She literally has no legal rights. She has told my son he's not really autistic because she doesn't believe he is. BTW, she's not in healthcare professionally. She literally works at a campground. I'm certified in dementia care and have worked as a caregiver for I/DD individuals in group homes extensively. I'm not psychiatrist level knowledgeable, but I do know what I'm talking about. \n\n  Am I the ass for saying it so bluntly? And am I the ass for drawing a distinction between a step parent and an involved, loving bio parent?", "created_utc": 1684383760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13koa2l/aita_for_quoting_lotr_you_have_no_power_here_to/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
