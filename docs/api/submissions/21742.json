{"id": 21742, "submission_id": "14uu8rf", "title": "AITA for shoving my stepdad to the ground and putting him in a chokehold?", "selftext": "Admittedly, the title is clickbaity.\n\nBackground: My (32M) mom married my stepdad (Jeff, 57M)) when I was 10-11 years old. My dad lived 350 miles away, so having Jeff around was kind of cool. As I grew older I also grew to despise Jeff. While my teenage hormones likely played a roll, Jeff is incredibly lazy and I'd always have to pick up his slack. My mom had to commute 2+ hours each way, so it was up to us to take care of most everything around the house. Jeff would lay on the couch, unmoving, with his eyes closed for HOURS but never asleep while I was doing laundry or mowing the lawn. Or even how he stood drinking a beer while me and my friends were moving us out of the home when we were evicted.\n\nBy the time I was 17 I was so over his crap and made no effort to hide it. One night my mom and I were arguing about something (story for a different sub). I see Jeff's shadow appear meaning he's standing right behind me. When I turned around he was about 1 foot away from me with the creepiest smile on his face. I *not so politely* asked, \"What the f### do you want?!\" He just stood there with that same weird smile. I asked if he wanted to hit me and his smile got bigger, so I told him to hit me and put my arms behind my back. Jeff pretended to walk away before turning back and shoving me causing me to fall onto their bed and almost landing on my mom's legs (important detail for later). By the time I stood back up, Jeff had already walked away.\n\nThe AITA moment (4th of July, 2023): A high school friend was back in town after being away for a while and wanted to have a BBQ. Mom and Jeff were invited. I'm barely on speaking terms with mom and Jeff, but was going to put my stuff aside and have a great time with my friends. As I'm in the backyard with my friends, I notice Jeff staring at me which I ignored until he eventually approached me. He started friendly until he said how I was a s###head as a kid, so I said, \"At least I never put hands on you.\" That is when things took a turn. He pushed me while maintaining that same smile. I kept my feet below me and told him to go away. He pushed me again and I immediately pushed him back and he started laughing. Jeff pushed me again and I asked a friend to take my beer when Jeff lunged at me.\n\nBefore I realized what I was doing I was grabbing his shirt and forcing him to the ground and then wrapping my arm around his throat. I was screaming, \"ARE YOU FINISHED?!\" He whimpers out a yes and I let him go. After he got up he tried to shake my hand and I walked away. My friends thought it was hilarious, but the moms there thought it was a terrible thing to do given his age. Most of them know my feelings about him but still believed I went too far. I've been attempting to defend myself, but their comments have been eating at me.\n\nWas I the AH here?
