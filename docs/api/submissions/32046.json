We had our ups and downs early on but we have recently been very solid and I certainly see myself long-term with her. We both live in a city together but I\u2019ve been renting a place in a lease with two of my closest childhood friends for about a year and a half now. The lease is yearly and expires in July. My two other roommates are totally on board and would like to renew the lease for a 3rd time once it\u2019s up. However, my girlfriend isn\u2019t afforded the same luxury as me. Her living situation is fine. She has a roommate that she isn\u2019t close with, but most important, they respect each other\u2019s space and privacy. But my gf doesn\u2019t want to renew a lease with her, and would much rather live with me than move into a new place alone or try to find a new place with a different person. She recently brought up that she would like to live with me once my lease is up in July, and to her defense, I was pretty quick to shut it down. We then got into an argument about how it\u2019s a stupid reason to want to renew my lease when my girlfriend is asking to live together, and that she feels it\u2019s a slap in the face and that I should reevaluate whether I want to seriously be with her or not. I personally don\u2019t feel a rush because I am very comfortable in our relationship and I also really enjoy my current living situation. I would be more than happy to move-in together after the 3rd lease ends, but she doesn\u2019t seem to want to wait as long. She says I am being selfish for not considering her situation and I partially understand that. I also think it\u2019s completely fair to want to do another year with my closest friends if they are both down to do so. I don\u2019t think that means I don\u2019t value our relationship, but we are butting heads on this matter.

She wants to live with you and you are telling her that even after 2 years together, you'd rather live with your friends. You're not an AH for not being ready to move in, but it could cost the relationship in the long run.", "NTA you\u2019re 24 - you don\u2019t have to be in any rush to move in to still cherish and take your relationship seriously. You\u2019re young and just not ready and that\u2019s totally normal. I know plenty of mid-20s couples that have been together for years but still prefer living separately at this stage of their lives. Moving in together when you\u2019re not feeling equally as motivated as she is will undoubtedly lead to conflict down the line that sharing a space would only exacerbate that. If she\u2019s so quick to call you selfish and suggest you don\u2019t take your relationship seriously, simply because you are establishing a normal boundary - I\u2019d be seriously considering if she is actually someone you\u2019d want to go that next step with down the line.", "NAH. You guys just seem to be on different pages and need to have a discussion. I would question whether this will last long term if you don\u2019t feel ready to move in together", "NTA If you don\u2019t want to live together yet, don\u2019t. That she\u2019s not happy in her current living situation isn\u2019t a compelling reason for you to move in with her. She wants another roommate. It doesn\u2019t have to be you. Don\u2019t let her force you to do something you\u2019re not really ready to do.", "I don\u2019t know\u2026 do you really see yourself with her in the long run? 2 years is quite a long time, and it\u2019s understandable that your girlfriend wants to take your relationship to the next level by moving in with you. If your only reason is because your current living situation is \u201ccomfortable\u201d I think you\u2019re not really that in love with her. She\u2019s asking you to take a chance with her but you\u2019re not willing to sacrifice your \u201ccomfort\u201d to be with her. That\u2019s the way I see it. You\u2019d rather be with your homies than her because that\u2019s what you\u2019re used to (plus they must be awesome roommates). \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019re not a jerk at all. You and your girlfriend are just not on the same page in your relationship. I feel sad for your girl. If money is not an issue she could wait for you to be ready. But unfortunately her situation is sticky and waiting is a luxury she couldn\u2019t afford. So if you don\u2019t help her out, this might be a deal breaker for you both. She might break up with you. If you\u2019re alright with that, then you\u2019re just not that into her. But if you don\u2019t want to let her go, then help her out! Then after moving in with her you can help your buddies find a new roommate and hang out with them from time to time.", "Your both come to that cross roads she wants more your still not there.   Your going to have to talk see if your future actually line up and a timeline", "YTA. Stop wasting her time. It\u2019s been two years. You either want to be with her or you don\u2019t and clearly you value your solo time more than living with her. Which is fine but be honest about it. Don\u2019t waste her time waiting around for you to commit. She wants a committed relationship and to live together, not with room mates. After two years together that is reasonable. You want to enjoy your alone time and live with room mates and not commit. Fine and dandy but don\u2019t waste her time. Break up and enjoy single life and one day find someone you care about enough to move in with. She isn\u2019t it and she knows it but feels like she invested two years and doesn\u2019t want to just walk away. Just end this shit, life is short.", "What are you asking reddit for? Do you value your friends or GF more? At some point you're gonna have to choose", "NTA  \n\nLiving together should be a two yes, one no decision. \n\nIf there is nothing wrong with her living accommodation other that she doesn't want to live there anymore then you shouldn't be guilt tripped into changing your accommodation plans.\n\nI suspect she sees two years in as being a suitable amount of time to take the next step, and assumed you were on the same page, and is pushing you to fit her timeline.  You need to have a discussion with her about future plans,  because it may be that she sees marriage and children sooner in your shared future than you do.", "YTA. Time for her to break up with you. She needs someone serious about her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Money is not an issue here. She could very easily afford a single bedroom in the city and pay the same as she\u2019s paying in her rent now or even less. She could also pay a little more and it would still not affect her financially.

It\u2019s not that you\u2019re rejecting her, you\u2019re just not ready. If the situation is reversed, you wouldn\u2019t pressure her to move in with you if she\u2019s clearly not ready.

You should choose your girlfriend over your friends because you like her more"]}
