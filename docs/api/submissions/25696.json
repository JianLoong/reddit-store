No way!! Laughter ensuing always. I believe it\u2019s a bonding thing between siblings or cousins.\nI remember my older brother had an awesome hoodie I always wanted to wear, but I was too small, I was so proud when he gave it to me, I wore that thing every day!!!

Of course you're NTA. \n\nA few years ago (2016ish?), I lived in South Florida and there was a hurricane that knocked out everyone's power for a while. The state decided to give everyone money to replace their groceries but it was first come, first served. One of my coworkers asked if I got any of the money and I said no, that I wanted the money to go to those who need it more. (I worked for $10.50/hour and lived with my parents at the time, so I wasn't rolling in dough but there were those who needed it worse than me.) You know what she told me?

However your in laws have a valid point when it comes to older kids in certain situations. If you have your oldest kid constantly get new clothes from a store with the \u201cin\u201d fashion while the youngest only gets hand me downs. It does sometimes create that \u201cI am less than\u201d feeling. I am taking about all kids being 7-8+ here in a family. This is usually in cases of favoritism with a golden child. \n\nHowever in your case you are handing down to people in need and with babies.", "Your inlaws have very unorthodox views. Baby clothes are so ubiquitously regifted down the family chain to those with new kids, I'm shocked anyone would object.

Why spend hundreds of dollars on clothes kids never seem to wear longer than a season?\nI grew up wearing hand-me-downs!! Only thing I didn't wear of my older brothers was underwear!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23  I honestly did not mind. I still dress like I did then....jeans & t-shirts. Same as my brothers. Hand-me-downs & used clothes in good shape are worth their weight in gold!!", "Seriously? Beggars can't be choosers. If you had taken 10 bin bags of smelly dirty worn out stuff and given it to them - yes - that would have been disrespectful - but heck! Nearly new stuff and someone gets bent out of shape....", "NTA\n\nMy kids just about only wear hand me downs. It's not only cheaper. It's good to get good use from clothes and is better for the environment. Hell, some of the stuff my friends pass around is doing the rounds for the 4th time!

Terrible for the environment. My sister had kids, gave all their stuff to my brother, he used it then gave it to me.

I nanny for a baby that comes from a big family on his mother\u2019s side. Both of his parents have received second hand clothing and toys even though they can afford it. It\u2019s just smart.", "NTA. In-laws are wacky. I've had children's clothes given by friends, family, random ppl and accepted. The ones I don't like I give away again. Money is too tight to care about clothes the kids grow out of in 6 months", "NTA. Tell your on-laws to eat a whole bag of ***** and mind their own business.", "NTA and the in laws can kick rocks! Lots of hand me downs with babies have hand little or no wear. Often due to being gifted in the wrong season/massive growth spurts etc etc. I know lots of well off people who gift and have been gifted second hand clothing or even buy second hand clothing! They go through it so quickly that it\u2019s perfectly fine to not want to spend excessive amounts on it!", "NTA. I grew up in a large family with 22 cousins, and our mothers passed around baby and children's clothes and other stuff like cribs, etc, so the mum with the next baby could use them.

For more dress up events they would go to consignment stores.  The spent pennies on the dollar.", "NTA. Your BIL and his wife seem happy with it, you asked them first and they said yes. Everybody else should mind their own business. \n\nI think it's a good idea to recycle the clothes. I had a mix of old and new with my babies clothes. I suppose for some it is a matter of pride or they think that if you give them stuff you think they are poor and you are \"looking down on them\". But that is not the case here. You did nothing wrong here but it's a topic where opinions differ.\n\nI'd make a mental note never to offer anything to the people who are squawking about this.", "Nta. Kids grow so fast. We buy a lot of stuff from Once Upon A Child because of how fast our kiddo has grown.", "NTA! My daughter\u2019s clothes went through 3 of my friends. It\u2019s nice to share and it\u2019s environmentally responsible on top.", "NTA. Your in-laws are on another planet.", "NTA. It isn't like they will live in these clothes forever. You saved them a lot of money. My family did this thing growing up, even with friends. A know at of people who have done this with their babies clothes, giving them to people and no one had issues.", "The whole 'second hand is humiliating' mentally is destroying our planet. We over consume and must purchase everything brand new while throwing away so much perfectly good stuff.\nLet's get rid of the 'second hand is only for poor people ' mentally that the capitalistic conglomerates want us to have.", "Definitely NTA. I got some of my coworkers grandsons hand me downs and it was the best as we had our little one in December 2020. It was a life saver. Even now I buy 90% of my daughters clothes 2nd hand through Facebook groups as they are not particularly worn and generally a lot cheaper. The last 10% is the nice stuff she wears for special occasions or socks (personal issue I have with shared socks being gross) and now underwear since she is getting to the potty training stage.", "I had lots of  gorgeous clothes for my boy. He was spoiled.  England has wonderful baby shops and I have lots of rellies there.   I saw those clothes on my nephew and friends kids for years.  They loved them. Such good value for the clothes.", "Nta, and your in-laws are idiots.", "Your in-laws are entitled snobs, there's nothing wrong with giving used clothing.

I\u2019m\nEven still doing hand me downs 6 years later!", "I'm not sure on what planet giving people with small children hand-me-down clothing that's in perfect or near perfect condition and that they're delighted to receive is rude or makes them feel inferior, but it definitely isn't Planet Earth.\n\nYou did something nice.  People I know with small kids are happy to get hand-me-downs, and this includes people who are perfectly financially comfortable.  Also, in case your in-law's weren't aware, the recycling of clothing is now pretty damned popular, and good for the planet.  \n\nNTA,, but your in=law's are, big time, for trying to make you feel bad for doing a good deed both for your BIL and for the planet.", "NTA. We do this in our family and the younger cousins get a kick out of wearing their older cousins clothes. As their fashion choice changes it doesn\u2019t always suit the younger kid but it is completely optional. \n\nWe were lucky to receive some beautiful second hand clothes and have paid the gift forward to family. \n\nIt seems stuck up to take such a positive act of giving and be so mean about it .", "\"OMG, I had no idea!

They were all attorneys btw, so it wasn't about money.", "Seriously and it's like...what exactly do these in laws think OP should've done with them? Sold/donated them to the secondhand or charity shop the BIL and his wife would likely be looking at for clothes soon anyway? Burned them in the yard? It's like...OP saw a need and made an offer to fulfill it, which the BIL accepted.", "I know several people that bought almost all of their kids clothes at Goodwill.  There are some really nice things there, you just have to hunt for them.", "It was the parents of the recipients", "Bil and wife were grateful. The in laws are the ones upset", "My mother has 4 sisters, as soon as a new baby was announced there would be the person who had the last baby arriving with boxes of baby clothes from newborn to whatever age their kid just outgrew. After a few babies it was split into boxes \u201cgirl\u201d, \u201cboy\u201d, \u201cif it fits it can be worn\u201d due to a few babies arriving close together (such as a sibling and cousin being born in the same month). If there were new clothes bought for a kid anything sentimental (to that family) was put aside and the rest added to the boxes as old clothes that got too worn to be worn. \n\nAs the original babies started having babies the boxes were offered to them as well (I have cousins younger than my kids). When I was pregnant my ex (and his mother) were at me about (me) having to buy clothing for twins and that I \u201chad nothing\u201d when I was around 5 months pregnant and we had moved into a house together. I just laughed. Then went to my parents to pull out the boxes labelled \u201cnewborn-6months\u201d\n\nMy kids were put into clothing that had been made for my mother due to those boxes."]}
