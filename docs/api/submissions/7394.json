I had met the other father and 2 moms before but I didn't know the other 2.\n\nWhen I went back this Tuesday, though, one of the teachers asked me to stop coming.

If my husband was facing any amount of this, the wrath of shame I\u2019d bring down on those insinuating and condoning would be felt loud and clear.

The cape really caught my attention as a kid. For last Valentines Day hubby bought me the limited edition pink Vader POP holding candy and roses. I proudly display it by our entry way, lol.

NTA", "Ooooh, I am steaming mad on your behalf!! NTA!\n\nAsk those women if they have ever heard of the program Watch DOGS (Dads of Great Students). It brings a much-needed male presence and male role models into the school. As the volunteer coordinator for my kids' elementary, we valued male volunteers. BTW, we had every combination of male/female principal and asst. principal - including males in both positions. The kids LOVED them! (And one was supertall - almost as tall at my 6'7\" husband who is also a very welcome volunteer with the kids).\n\nTalk to the principal about not allowing gender discrimination of volunteers. I'm assuming your school district has all volunteers get a background check; if not, they should. Under no circumstances should two random parents control who is and isn't allowed to volunteer.\n\nYou may point out that their attitude is creating a hostile environment that makes the children unnecessarily and inappropriately afraid of men and suggest that those two women may need to be removed from volunteering if they can't seem to work well with all duly approved volunteers, including those of the male persuasion.", "Wtf is wrong with those mom and how dare the teacher no put them In check.\nNTA and thank you for participating and being so involved with your kids!", "NTA.\n\nThey're literally saying you're not allowed to help your child at school because you're a man. How the hell is that ok?", "I fear men as much as the next guy and even I think NTA. I hope those ladies that think that don\u2019t have sons", "NTA. I was terrified of men as a kid because I had an abusive father. I was able to work on my fear because I had a few male teachers that were super kind. I wished my father would care enough to even show up to concerts and plays or pick me up from practice without screaming at me. You are going the extra mile and are actively participating in your childrens' lives. Talk to a school administrator and let them know you are being harassed into not showing up to support your kids. Show them the messages in the group chat and let them know you are doing nothing wrong by being there.", "I hate this nonsense. These women need to pull their heads in and be grateful their children are seeing a man show what a great dad looks like. \n\nNTA but they are.

Dads being involved in their kids life is great. You are there for your kids and these moms are probably just jealous of how involved you are compared to their men", "nta and this is ridiculous.

I shouldn\u2019t be shamed out of helping for my childrens school and it\u2019s completely insulting you\u2019re trying to get me to stop doing things I enjoy doing for my kids, have the day you deserve.\u201d  \ud83d\ude03 that way you can come off just as catty and shitty as they are.", "NTA, children are going to have to deal with being round a \"tall man\" at some point.", "I work in theatre and I can't f'in even...

When my kids were in school, there were plenty of dads involved, my husband being one of them.

Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Raise a fuss about this. You are a parent and should not feel unwelcome when participating. Fathers should just as welcome as mothers.", "i think it's appalling that they asked you to leave. you absolutely stay right where you are! you are doing what is best for your kid and yourself AND being a good role model for all the other kids. you're all that is right in the world and they're stomping on it. NO.\n\nyou are NTA.", "Is it misandry? Their behaviour was mental and unacceptable, and the conditioning that women are more suitable for childcare doesn\u2019t help us, and alienates the men who are capable and willing, and is an excuse for the men who enjoy being useless. But we\u2019re also all kinds of messed up because like, men have become so unfamiliar as carers that we assume they\u2019re predators?

We need more guys like you to model this behavior for everyone else, especially kids.", ">She told me that two of the moms ( the one I had not met before) didn't feel safe having me and the other father so close to their children.\n\nNope, this is because they think you're a sexual predator because you're a man who's near children.", "Given that the previous incident involved them telling someone that they didn't feel safe having you and the other father around their children, it's pretty obvious that they are of the awful, sexist types that think men working with children= predators. They just don't have the courage to say it straight to their face. I wouldn't be able to avoid the temptation to throw it right back at them: \"well, I don't feel safe having you around my children.\"\n\nI will say this: go to the administration. Tell them what's going on. Take the other father involved as well if at all possible. Get ahead of this before they go and make shit up to get you in trouble. Because they absolutely will. Maybe even talk to the other mothers that you already knew- they'll probably stand up for you... You're likely a rock star to them.", "Nah they're sexist and petty as fuck. However, now you know which moms are bigots for you to avoid / have to be ultra careful around or else they'll blow something minor up to get you removed \"for safety\".", "Then this sounds like a great opportunity for the kids to learn you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Maybe they\u2019ll be initially nervous, but will see that you\u2019re a genuinely friendly, helpful dad and not scary at all.", "By the sound of it we probably look somewhat similar.

Middle & high school had more male teachers.", "Yup... I'll bet most of the other mothers there would be super pissed at the 2 that are making a big deal over fathers volunteering for the school.", "And it's even more important for those kids who don't have a dad in their life or who don't have a good dad. \n\nMy friend was a primary school teacher (elementary school).
