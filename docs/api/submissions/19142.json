We live in London so naturally had never shared more than a silent nod in one another\u2019s direction when we pass in the street. That is, until he knocked on my door a few years ago. He said he could smell the food I was cooking and asked if he could have some. From the brief interaction with him I could tell he didn\u2019t have all his mental faculties so I thought f it why not and dished he and his wife up a portion. Boy did I open Pandora\u2019s box. \n\nSince then he\u2019s knocked on my door at least once a week for a meal, requests to fix things, use something or contact someone on his behalf. For context, I find socialising mentally draining. I\u2019m able to soldier through it for a day, but when I get home I just want to shut the world out and enjoy my own company. So while I\u2019ve entertained him over the years, I haven\u2019t enjoyed it. At all.\n\nI\u2019ve resorted to not really using my front or back garden incase he invites himself over (a few weeks after his aunt passed he gatecrashed a bbq I was hosting for my mum\u2019s bday where he introduced himself to each guest with \u201chi I\u2019m \u2026 I lost my aunt\u201d). Once I saw him wanking in his garden but ngl that tidbit isn\u2019t integral to the story. I dread hearing the doorbell because I know regardless of how many times I try to politely shut down convo, I\u2019ll be engaged for at least 20 mins. I can\u2019t even sit in my front room with the curtains open incase he sees me because he rings incessantly until I answer.\n\nRecently the council moved his wife into a care home and I know it\u2019s been hard on him because his visits have increased to 3/4 times a week. He came over yesterday with a list of things he needs done. I know he means no harm but at this point I\u2019m just drained. I suggested a local food bank and told him to get in contact with his social worker (for the millionth time), but he never does and I don\u2019t see why I have to do all the things my taxes are already paying for him to get free access to. \n\nAnyway, I made him dinner but politely told him this would be the last time I could help him out. I had a friend on the phone at the time who said I was an ah because I\u2019m all he\u2019s got and he\u2019s not mentally well enough to understand social boundaries so it\u2019s a dick move to cut him off. Honestly I wish I was the type of person who loves socialising and was able to help him out without it feeling like I\u2019m carrying dead weight, but after 3 years I just don\u2019t have anything left to give.

Your friend is TA. They are not dealing with this incessant intrusive behavior. You are. How about they swap homes with you and see how they like it. I cannot stand when someone who has no clue starts telling someone else what they should do or how they should behave. Simply stop engaging. Don't fix any more plates of food, don't open your door. You aren't social services, nor are you responsible for your neighbor, who is essentially a stranger to you. And tell your friend to quit being a dick.", "NTA. You've already done more than enough and gone above and beyond. It's a sad situation but it's not yours to fix. You could still help him out very rarely once in a while, but you're not even obligated to do that", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re a star for having put up with this nonsense for 3 years", "NTA! Is there someplace you can call to get him the help he desperately needs? Maybe the council who got his wife moved to a care facility?", "Nta, your friend would probably do the same, heck maybe your nb would've been denied from the very first interaction.", "You've been very kind so far. As a fellow human being, thank you for that.\n\nNAH to say no.   You can only give so much of yourself.  Since he has mental faculty issues, can you call his case worker and tell them what's going on.  they might not knowhow much he depends on you. Perhaps that will get the ball rolling to get him the help he actually needs?\n\nNot that you owe this extra chore, just putting it out there.", "Definitely NTA this is very taxing, even though it's not your responsibility I would suggest contacting social services yourself and explaining to them he isn't coping on his own and you can't be his care taker. Unless someone steps in I'm afraid his visits will continue and maybe even get progressively worse.", "NTA\n\nI had something similar when a neighbour we agreed to help a few times took it too far. We would get shopping got them but then a day or so later would phone at 8/9pm at night saying he hadn't eaten that day and asked if we could go buy things. A day where I wasn't well but was dropping my daughter off to my parents (at 7:30pm), came to the door asking for me to get his electricity topped up. I said no and he's not again since, nor have I spoke to him. This neighbour can physically get out and use taxi's etc.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's fine to help someone from time to time but they shouldn't be using you as reliance. Its good to establish boundaries, especially with neighbours", "NTA of course, and you are a saint for having done so much already.", "NTA. If you have been personal secretary to him for 3 years despite your natural inclinations (introverted character) I dare say you have done your part at being kind. But do cut him off gradually as a final act of kindness since he\u2019s been relying on you for 3 years. Would be cruel to cut him off suddenly since he doesn\u2019t have  his mental faculties with him and he will most likely be bewildered and lost if you were to go cold turkey.", "NTA, you are *not* all he's got. I feel for him, he's obviously lonely and ill - but you are not responsible for him. \n\n*You* could call a social worker and explain the situation? They could get in contact with him, and become his new friend for him to lean on?", "NTA- he saw you as an easy way out so he didn't have to do those things.  If he keeps showing up you need to be blunt with him and say NO firmly.", "Nta. You have a right to enjoy your home without worrying about uninvited guests who lean so much on you. \n\nHe needs to speak to his social worker if he needs more support. You aren't his carer", "Can you contact one of his relatives or a social worker on his behalf? From what you've written, I doubt he understands that you're unable to help this much. NAH.", "NTA - the guy clearly needs assistance that is beyond anything a neighbor can address, even if they wanted to. Agree that it's not your responsibility, but it would be one final kindness to contact his social worker on his behalf.", "NTA - it\u2019s great to help out and be there for others but when It starts to take a toll on your own well-being it\u2019s time to take a step back.", "Why are you \u201call he has\u201d? Your his neighbor. There is no obligatory special connection that neighbors have. It\u2019s not familial. It\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s not in-laws. It\u2019s not even friendly. I have neighbors on either side of me - none of them are obligated to help me in my times of need, and it wouldn\u2019t make them bad people for declining to do so. They\u2019re just people I happen to live next to. You did some acts of kindness and quickly got overloaded with a *to-do list* and being his personal chef. \n\nCut the guy off.
