We live in London so naturally had never shared more than a silent nod in one another\u2019s direction when we pass in the street. That is, until he knocked on my door a few years ago. He said he could smell the food I was cooking and asked if he could have some. From the brief interaction with him I could tell he didn\u2019t have all his mental faculties so I thought f it why not and dished he and his wife up a portion. Boy did I open Pandora\u2019s box. \n\nSince then he\u2019s knocked on my door at least once a week for a meal, requests to fix things, use something or contact someone on his behalf. For context, I find socialising mentally draining. I\u2019m able to soldier through it for a day, but when I get home I just want to shut the world out and enjoy my own company. So while I\u2019ve entertained him over the years, I haven\u2019t enjoyed it. At all.\n\nI\u2019ve resorted to not really using my front or back garden incase he invites himself over (a few weeks after his aunt passed he gatecrashed a bbq I was hosting for my mum\u2019s bday where he introduced himself to each guest with \u201chi I\u2019m \u2026 I lost my aunt\u201d). Once I saw him wanking in his garden but ngl that tidbit isn\u2019t integral to the story. I dread hearing the doorbell because I know regardless of how many times I try to politely shut down convo, I\u2019ll be engaged for at least 20 mins. I can\u2019t even sit in my front room with the curtains open incase he sees me because he rings incessantly until I answer.\n\nRecently the council moved his wife into a care home and I know it\u2019s been hard on him because his visits have increased to 3/4 times a week. He came over yesterday with a list of things he needs done. I know he means no harm but at this point I\u2019m just drained. I suggested a local food bank and told him to get in contact with his social worker (for the millionth time), but he never does and I don\u2019t see why I have to do all the things my taxes are already paying for him to get free access to. \n\nAnyway, I made him dinner but politely told him this would be the last time I could help him out. I had a friend on the phone at the time who said I was an ah because I\u2019m all he\u2019s got and he\u2019s not mentally well enough to understand social boundaries so it\u2019s a dick move to cut him off. Honestly I wish I was the type of person who loves socialising and was able to help him out without it feeling like I\u2019m carrying dead weight, but after 3 years I just don\u2019t have anything left to give.

As a fellow human being, thank you for that.\n\nNAH to say no.   You can only give so much of yourself.

Unless someone steps in I'm afraid his visits will continue and maybe even get progressively worse.", "NTA\n\nI had something similar when a neighbour we agreed to help a few times took it too far. We would get shopping got them but then a day or so later would phone at 8/9pm at night saying he hadn't eaten that day and asked if we could go buy things. A day where I wasn't well but was dropping my daughter off to my parents (at 7:30pm), came to the door asking for me to get his electricity topped up. I said no and he's not again since, nor have I spoke to him. This neighbour can physically get out and use taxi's etc.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's fine to help someone from time to time but they shouldn't be using you as reliance. Its good to establish boundaries, especially with neighbours", "NTA of course, and you are a saint for having done so much already.", "NTA. If you have been personal secretary to him for 3 years despite your natural inclinations (introverted character) I dare say you have done your part at being kind. But do cut him off gradually as a final act of kindness since he\u2019s been relying on you for 3 years. Would be cruel to cut him off suddenly since he doesn\u2019t have  his mental faculties with him and he will most likely be bewildered and lost if you were to go cold turkey.", "NTA, you are *not* all he's got. I feel for him, he's obviously lonely and ill - but you are not responsible for him. \n\n*You* could call a social worker and explain the situation? They could get in contact with him, and become his new friend for him to lean on?", "NTA- he saw you as an easy way out so he didn't have to do those things.  If he keeps showing up you need to be blunt with him and say NO firmly.", "Nta. You have a right to enjoy your home without worrying about uninvited guests who lean so much on you. \n\nHe needs to speak to his social worker if he needs more support. You aren't his carer", "Can you contact one of his relatives or a social worker on his behalf? From what you've written, I doubt he understands that you're unable to help this much. NAH.", "NTA - the guy clearly needs assistance that is beyond anything a neighbor can address, even if they wanted to. Agree that it's not your responsibility, but it would be one final kindness to contact his social worker on his behalf.", "NTA - it\u2019s great to help out and be there for others but when It starts to take a toll on your own well-being it\u2019s time to take a step back.", "Why are you \u201call he has\u201d? You\u2019re his neighbor. There is no obligatory special connection that neighbors have. It\u2019s not familial. It\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s not in-laws. It\u2019s not even friendly. I have neighbors on either side of me - none of them are obligated to help me in my times of need, and it wouldn\u2019t make them bad people for declining to do so. They\u2019re just people I happen to live next to. You did some acts of kindness and quickly got overloaded with a *to-do list* and being his personal chef. \n\nCut the guy off.

When he comes into your yard, say, \"I'm sorry, I'm busy right now\" and escort him out of your yard back to his own door, open it, and gently nudge him back through it and close it.

Im not from the UK, so I don't know how all your welfare stuff works. Could you call the council and have them send someone to check on him?\n\nOh and your friend was way out of line. You've done way more than most people would.", "Nta\n\nThere may be a solution to your problem. Consider touching base with your local council about him. Describe your interactions and ask if more support can be provided to him.  Mention his wife is  recently in care, and that he seems much less well since. \n\nYou could end off with something like your work hours have increased, so you will not be able to assist him going forward as you have the last several years. \n\nDisability services were cut back several years ago, it\u2019s possible he qualifies for care now that he didn\u2019t previously. But if he isn\u2019t on your council\u2019s list (maybe since cut backs) he may not be getting the help he is entitled to now. And if he does have an intellectual disability, he may not know what he is entitled to or how to access those services. He may not have a social worker, for example. \n\nThe other option is to go the nuisance route. Again, talk to your local authorities. But the context is that this gentleman is harassing you, because they are not providing him with adequate services. You hit up the council first, and the police after a certain point. Essentially creating a paper trail that eventually forces the council\u2019s hand in the matter.  If there is a local hotline for seniors or disabled people this would also be a good place to make additional phone calls.", "NTA.\n\nCall social services and have them move him into a facility too. Seems like he is not capable of living on his own.", "This is what I came here to say... add to that you'll hand him HER phone number since she's volunteering. Now SHE'S all he has. NTA"]}
