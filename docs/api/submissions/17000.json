I did things when I was drinking that I\u2019d never do now that I\u2019m sober. \n\nIt won\u2019t hurt you to live in an alcohol-free home. It WILL be a problem for her having alcohol in the home. You can go anywhere to drink. The one place she has as a safe refuge is home. \n\nIf you value her and your relationship, try being supportive. Supportive family and friends are essential in addiction recovery.  \n\nI\u2019ve been sober 31 years next month, believe me\u2026I know what it takes. \n\nAlso, you won\u2019t have to \u201csuffer\u201d forever.

Are you trying to sabotage her sobriety? Why are you more invested in having alcohol at home than in your wife being a sober parent to you kids?\n\nAre you also struggling with alcoholism?", "Honestly if it\u2019s that much of an issue for you then you might need to have a look at your own relationship with alcohol.\n\nSure, her recovery is her responsibility but it\u2019s not unreasonable for someone that\u2019s sober to want an booze free home.

I do disagree with her comments about it being irresponsible to drink around children, drinking a normal amount and not getting wasted isn\u2019t an issue.

He'd do it in his office and I could smell it on his breath-- it was crazy how much I was tempted by just the smell. Think about what you drinking in the house means. She will smell it on your breath, which just makes things harder. She will see the empty containers, and she really sounds like she wants to maintain her hard-won sobriety. Keeping temptation around and just expecting her to use her willpower is selfish on your part. She's an addict, dude, there is a precedent that willpower is not enough for her. Help her out. Part of being a couple is changing and growing together as life throws challenges at you.

You say she drank in front of them and you never criticized her for it which is concerning on your part and hers.

I like to drink but I never even think of it when I'm with my sister who is a recovering alcoholic.\n\nAlso nice job telling her she was irresponsible after she's already made a serious effort to stop as if it somehow excuses you continuing the same behaviour that she stopped. I'm sure that is really helping the situation.", "YTA\n\nYour \u201creasoning\u201d involves using the past habits of a recovering alcoholic, do you not see an issue with that?", "YTA\n\nSo you support your wife, but only when it's not an inconvenience.

Your response isn\u2019t unreasonable if it is a permanent ban that your wife seeks. If she wants a permanent ban then she is demanding that you should yield to her illness for life rather than her taking steps to get well enough not to see every vessel containing liquor as an irresistible temptation.

I could understand if it was your family member that was asking this of you, but this is your wife. Addiction is a sickness and in your vows, it was sickness and in health. Your wife is sick. You can always go to a bar or somewhere else to drink. Her asking you to be sober is one thing, but only asking you not to drink in the house is not that big of a deal. The comment about the children was a little over the top as like you stated, a little hypocritical.

She's asking to have a home that doesn't tempt her to relapse. This is not only ideal for your wife, but your kids as well. She's asking you for this one thing. You can go to a friend's house or a bar if you want to drink alcohol. The fact that you are making such a stink about this makes me wonder if you need to think about your own relationship with alcohol. Alcohol shouldn't be more important than your wife.", "YTA yikes", "Yta, I was trying to encourage my hubby to drink less spirits (he like many alcoholics will drink every last drop and then we will have hours of arguing over stupid stuff)but had vodka pre mixers for when I wanted something alcoholic.

She's asking for the alcohol to be removed from the house so that it's harder for her to relapse.\n\nIf the idea of getting rid of the alcohol in the house is this big a deal for you, then you need to think hard about why you're so against getting rid of it and why you're trying to argue that you should be allowed to drink in front of your young children.", "YTA\n\nShe made it very clear that no alcohol around will help her recover and you want to blatantly ignore that? Alcoholism isn't a simple impulsive thought where if she gives in you can go \"Oh well, it's just a drink.\" It's a mental battle that requires a lot of effort and support. If you want to drink, go out maybe with some friends and have a pint. If you purposely drink in front of her despite her wishes then no, you cannot say you are not to blame if she relapses.", "YTA.  She needs to kick your alcoholic ass out.  She has no hope of recovery living with a narcissistic bottom feeder.\n\nYour wife has a life-threatening condition, and all you can say is, \"But what about ME!\"  So sorry that your wife's struggle for survival interrupts your drinking.

It can be totally fine to do that is as long as it's done in moderation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, based on your post, it seems like you simply don't understand how damaging the mere presence of alcohol can be for someone who is a recovering alcoholic. Dealing with the temptation of drinking is psychologically debilitating for someone in recovery. It's unreasonable to expect your wife to be able to deal with the constant presence of alcohol. Many alcoholics never get to a place where they are comfortable being around it.\n\nYou have two choices:\n\n1.\tKeep alcohol in your house\n2.\tKeep your wife\n\nYou can't have it both ways.

Eventually he drank himself to death.\n\nI say all that to say NTA. You are under no obligation to modify your behavior to help your spouse stay sober.

You can drink when you go out, there\u2019s no reason to keep alcohol in the house when your wife is recovering from alcoholism. She is getting sober for herself, but also for you and the kids.

Having alcohol in the house shouldn\u2019t really be a huge deal, and if it\u2019s something you\u2019re so dependent on that you need to have it in the house rather than ensure the safety and well being of your family, maybe you should seek recovery as well.", "YTA, and you should educate yourself on how alcohol addiction works.

No, Alcoholics Anonymous always says that people need to quit for themselves, no one else. Or it won\u2019t work. So why would she expect you to quit for her when you don\u2019t have an issue?

It's not too much to ask someone stop putting poison in their body for a couple years while the person they swore to love through sickness and health needs their help and support.

And to the many suggestions that you should go to a bar or a friends house to imbibe, first it's costlier at the bar, and second as long as you are able to limit yourself to the same sober quantity of alcohol each night there's nothing wrong and you need not re-examine your relationship with alcohol.", "NAH\n\nShe\u2019s reasonable to ask you not to have alcohol in the house given her situation (although I disagree that having alcohol in front of the kids is bad, actually teaching them how to safely and moderately enjoy alcoholic drinks is important).\n\nYou are reasonable to want to be able to have a drink in your house.\n\nRealistically one of you is going to have to give in to the other on this though\u2026 and if she gives in and let\u2019s you have alcohol in the house the result may be her relapsing.

She brought it up with me and I told her that as much as I want the best for her, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me not be able to drink just because she can\u2019t. \n\nShe then told me that it\u2019s irresponsible of me to drink in front of our two young children, which is quite hypocritical considering she had no problem doing it when she wanted to, and I never criticised her for it. I understand that seeing other people drink could possibly tempt her to, but it\u2019s up to her whether she does that or not and I\u2019m not the one to blame if it happens. I just think that it\u2019s not right for me to have to pretty much be sober just because she is. Am I in the wrong here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
