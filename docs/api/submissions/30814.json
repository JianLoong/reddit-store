So, here's the deal:  \nI have this adorable cat that I absolutely love. Recently I started doing this silly thing where I pretend to \"suck out his life force.\" I do it in a playful way but I use a weird voice - think emperor palpatine/ meat canyon character, and I say things like, \"Oh, your energy is oh so sweet. It gives me the power to remain immortal!\" or \"sing your sweet sweet song to me\" and for added effect, I roll my head back, and my eyes go up into my sockets. The cat likes it and purrs. I mean in a real way the cat actually is giving me its life force but I think it's funny to talk like this. Sometimes I make weird alien sounds while doing it.  \nMy girlfriend thinks it's creepy. Like, really creepy. She doesn't find it amusing at all and gets upset when I do it. She says it's weird that I talk to the cat in such a strange way and that the whole \"sucking out life force\" thing is \"fucking creepy weirdo serial killer bullshit.\"  \nI genuinely find it funny, and it's just a playful way for me to enjoy my time with my cat.

If you like the girl, find her humor style and come up with a new creative way to love on your cat. If not, enjoy your cat while you find someone who is compatible with your humor style. In general, though, if you don't take steps to adjust to your partner's needs when they are upset by something and when you can easily adjust, YTA.

I have always done this with all my pets. These are the things you do with pets. To me, it would be really weird if you didnt do fun silly things with them. We are their whole world. Why wouldnt we give it to them. I dont think your GF is really a pet person and just tolerates them. Tell her to lighten up and have a little fun.", "NTA. What a weird thing for your girlfriend to be upset about.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like this is triggering some emotional memory with her.
