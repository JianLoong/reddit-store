Everything was going great in our relationship, so recently I felt like it was time for the next step - for us to start living together. I wanted to ask her to move to my place, since she was living with her parents and there is enough place in my apartment for both of us.  \n\nThe other day we were chilling in my apartment and when it got late she started preparing to go home because she had to attend her college classes the next morning. I told her \"'Hey babe, you don't have to leave anymore if you don't want to\". She asked me what do I mean and that's when I shared my idea for us to start living together. She smiled and said she's been thinking the same thing recently, but didn't want to bring the topic herself. We hugged and I was really glad we are on the same page.\n\nNow here is when things get problematic. My girlfriend has a 7yr old cat that she loves very much. At the same time I have an extreme cat allergy - whenever I get near her cat I start sneezing, my eyes get red and sometimes I even get a rash. That's why I don't even go to her place anymore. So, I told my girlfriend that because of my allergy, she won't be able to bring her cat, and it would be best for her to leave the cat to her parents, they live together anyway, they love her and know how to take care of her.\n\nMy girlfriend was taken aback, she said there were some pills I can take (antihistamine pills) in order to keep my symptoms at bay . I told her I don't want to take these drugs for the rest of my life, as they obviously have some unwanted side effects. We had an argument (believe it or not this was our first serious argument ever), we couldn't reach an agreement so we decided to call it a day.\n\nThis happened 2 days ago and we haven't talked since. I feel bad for asking her to abandon her cat, but at the same time I am not willing to jeopardize my health and well being. It sucks if this causes our relationship to end, but I don't think there is much I can do.

That is a pretty big deal when you are thinking about a future together. I am a dog person myself and I would rehome a boyfriend before I would rehome my dogs. That's a no-brainer for me.", "She\u2019s gonna choose the cat, homie. If you love this girl, you need to find a compromise. I take allergy meds every day for chronic allergies to basically everything. NAH NOW, but if you refuse to try your relationship is over.", "NAH - It sounds like living together is not going to work. I've always had cats and my husband is allergic and takes meds. I understand why you wouldn't want to do that. But asking her to get rid of her older cat is cruel", "I\u2019m not sure a judgment is really relevant here. If you have an allergy you\u2019re not willing or able to medicate for whatever reason and she\u2014understandably\u2014doesn\u2019t want to lose her cat, your relationship has probably run its course. You\u2019re still young, plenty of fish in the sea.", "23m here, I have a 1 year old cat. 2 weeks into dating a girl she tells me she has cat allergies, like her throat starts closing up kind of allergies. That was it- I didn\u2019t pursue it anymore, it wasn\u2019t going to work as my cat is gonna live with me wherever I go and I won\u2019t budge on that. There\u2019s a million other people on the planet that aren\u2019t allergic to one of the greatest joys in my life.\n\nThe whole point of spending time dating someone is to figure out and iron out these kinds of issues and differences. How you\u2019ve dated for 2 years and this has never come up baffles me. If HER plan was for her cat to come with her wherever she resides, SHE should\u2019ve let you know a lot sooner.\n\nI can understand not wanting to take allergy medication for an indeterminate amount of time, and it\u2019s not like the cat is being \u201cabandoned\u201d, as a matter of fact the cat would be staying in the house it knows with her parents that already look after it. I can also understand that if you\u2019re not a pet owner it might be discombobulating when they pick the cat over you, if that is the case.\n\nI\u2019m calling NAH, but you\u2019re both fools for not talking about it earlier", "Question. Is she already on or will you expect her to be on BC for pregnancy control? You know, a pill with serious side affects for the sake of the relationship?", "If you're that severely allergic to cats, you shouldn't be dating someone with a cat. It sucks, but it is what it is. I have mental health issues, and cats help me so much. So I know I couldn't date someone unwilling or unable to live with a cat. When I first met my husband, I made that clear before we got serious because it was so important to me. You knew she had a cat when you started dating her. You knew you were allergic. You pursued the relationship anyway without making it clear that you wouldn't live with a cat. It was implied through her already having a cat that that's where you'd be headed. YTA. \n\nYou have three choices here. You can either live with the cat, live separately indefinitely (the cat could easily live another 10 years, so this would most likely put severe strain on your relationship), or break up. \n\nShe made a commitment to that cat. She loves that cat. She has known that cat much longer than she's known you. She's not going to abandon him, and if she does for this reason, she's not a particularly good person anyway.", "Welcome to adulthood.  Sometimes there are problems with no easy answers.   You can't just tell her to blow off a beloved pet because, and she can't just expect you to deal. \n\nPull up your big boy pants.  Tell her what you are and aren't willing to do.  You also need to respect that she may not make the decision you were hoping for, and that doesn't make her ta.", "I feel like this is something you should have brought up long ago.", "NAH. It's her choice to move in and get rid of the cat, or wait. Naturally the idea of getting rid of the cat is upsetting so her response is fine. But your request is totally reasonable too.\n\nCats are great, but if you're allergic you shouldn't feel forced to endure one.\n\nDon't listen to all the wankers telling you you're unreasonable.", "Antihistamines do nothing for my severe cat allergies. Even if I never see the cat, the allergens from its saliva are on the dander deposited on everything with which it comes into contact.\n\nHence, I don't date people with cats.", "Question: How is it possible that you don\u2019t react to the dander on your girlfriend\u2019s clothing when she visits? Do you ever go to parties where people have cats? Has an allergist done a skin prick test? And recommended treatments IE sublingual immunotherapy or antihistamines (the new type like Allegra don\u2019t make you drowsy.)\nDust in the home, fragrance, plants\u2026they\u2019re all culprits until an actual prick test.", "YTA. You dated someone who had a cat knowing that you'd never be able to live with them while they had the pet. People love their animals and asking someone to choose between you and them is a super shitty thing to do to someone. If someone put me in the same  position as you did your gf I'd be dumping your ass in no time.", "YTA. You'd be out of my life so fast it isn't even funny. You should break it off now. It's cruel to ask her to give up a family member. Hiw did this not come up sooner? 2 years is a long enough time for you to have told her that she will never be able to be with you and have a cat.", "When my friend started dating the guy who became her husband, they ran into the same problem. The first thing he did when he realized he was serious about her (about 5 weeks in LOL) was research high-end vaccuums that suck up cat dander. He kept price comparing them and made a chart comparing their relative merits. It was one of nerdiest romantic things I've ever seen someone do.\n\nPoint being: he thought about her needs and figured out ways to try HARD to accommodate his allergies, her love for her cats, and being able to visit her.\n\nIn the end, she re-housed her kitties before they lived together. Nothing else worked. But he didn't start with a casual suggestion that she ditch her cats. He knew her better than that and cared about her too much to have that be his first impulse.\n\nNor did he -- ahem -- jump on a blame-assigning subreddit and try to figure out who the bad guy was. If that's how you think about relationships, I hope your girlfriend thinks hard before committing to you.\n\nYTA.", "I would deffo dump u and keep my cats", "I don't understand why people with pets start dating people with allergies to said pet. I have 2 cats if you tell me you're allergic or for any reason don't like or want to live with cats I'm not going to continue a relationship with you (this is something I bring up very early in any dating scenario). Me and my cats are a package deal with no negotiations. I wouldn't expect them to get rid of pets for me either. Everyone sucks you for continuing a relationship with someone who has cats when you're allergic and your GF for dating someone who has allergies to her pets.", "YTA. The fact that you didn't initially take this into consideration before discussing the next steps is kinda wild. You'd be better off waiting until the cat passed. I wouldn't be giving up my cat for a guy.", "You know the cat is important to her and she loves it very much. You know she's had the cat longer than she's known you. And yet rather than discuss what to do about the cat situation, you unilaterally decide that it has to stay with her parents. YTA.\n\nPeople with pets or kids should not have to sacrifice their relationships with them to be in a relationship with you.\n\nAlso, does your GF take birth control pills? Because that's an everyday pill she takes for your relationship that has serious side effects for her. If you're serious about her, take the antihistamines. And it won't be for the rest of your life. Stop being dramatic.", "YTA. I would end a relationship before I would abandon my pet. You should have brought this up way sooner. My husband of 15 years is allergic to our two cats that I got before we met. He takes an allergy pill and everything is fine. My best friends husband was allergic to her dog. He took a pill and everything was fine. Both partners loved our pets as much as we do.", "YTA. My parents are a few fights away from a divorce. My father is allergic to cats, displays the same symptoms as you. Has never once told my mother to get rid of the cat that is already settled with her. He takes antihistamines, fed her food to help regulate shedding, lint rollers, etc. My girlfriend has the same symptoms too. But I can't get her to stop cuddling with my cat, she won't take antihistamines either. \n\nShe's moving in with you. If you love her, you'll make a sacrifice, and work something out so that the cat can live with someone he's used to. Vacuuming more, having her brush him often, etc.", "NAH \n\nThough I will share my experience\u2026\n\nMy husband is allergic to cats. We have two. He takes a Claritin every day with little or no side effects. He has become less allergic to *our* cats over time but still has issues when they want to be in his face.\n\nObviously everyone is different, so I won\u2019t just tell you to get over it. Your allergy may be more severe or you may have a different reaction to medication. But also your girlfriend is reasonable to not want to give up her cat (or even the hope of having future cats in her life).\n\nI hope you can find a compromise", "You should have considered the pet factor before asking her to live with you tbh. It's her cat, not her family's cat, so it should have been expected that where she goes her cat will go too. Between the fact that she has the cat 7 years versus your 2 year relationship, y'all being in different life stages (25, employed, has his own place vs 21, college student, living with her parents) I think it's best you put a pause on this entire moving in situation for the moment and revisit this later on when emotions are set aside and you're on a more level playing field. A cat can easily live 20 years so this is not going to be a short term issue by any means. For now, NAH.", "YTA. She's had the cat a lot longer than she's had you. If you aren't willing to live with her cat, then you both need to find someone more compatible. You guys could break up over something else, and she would have rehomed a beloved pet for NOTHING. You had two years to see this coming, and you're shocked that you just might not get your way??\n\nPets are a lifetime commitment. Not \"until I date this guy\" commitment. Cheers to your GF for standing by her furbaby.\n\nI tell everyone I've ever dated that I have cats, and that they can't make me choose between my cats and my relationship. The cats were here before them, and they'll be here still while the guy is walking out the door. A real partner *for me* will love my pets, and understand they are non-negotiable. My husband LOVES our cats, and yes, he is allergic. He takes meds and gets along just fine. Because he loves me AND my cats, and would NEVER ask me to abandon a seven-year relationship with an animal who is entirely dependent on me.\n\nYTA!", "NAH you\u2019re both finding out about what you are or are not willing to compromise. Be aware she likely will not give up her 7 year old cat for this relationship, and that does NOT make her an asshole. Just as you asking once for her to consider giving her cat to her parents doesn\u2019t make you one. If you continue to ask after she sets a no boundary, then you will be an ass. Allergies suck, and you shouldn\u2019t have to continually have allergic reactions or take allergy meds forever, but she also shouldn\u2019t have to get rid of her cat. It\u2019s an impasse. Best of luck", "I think you went about this the wrong way. Instead of going straight to \u201cMove in with me! \u2764\ufe0f Oh, btw, dump your cat.\u201d You should have started with \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about us moving in together, but I\u2019m worried about my cat allergy\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re dating a cat person. Spend 5 seconds searching old AITA posts and you\u2019ll find a ton about people not wanting to give up a pet or even wanting to get a new pet despite a partner\u2019s allergies. Even if she leaves this cat with her parents, this won\u2019t be the last time the issue comes up. I\u2019m allergic to cats and hate scooping the litter box, but I still think about getting a cat. (My last one died 5 years ago.) They are kind of irresistible for some of us. \n\nThere are some things you can try for your allergy. Cat isn\u2019t my only allergy so I\u2019m on meds just to live in the world. There\u2019s a lot out there with varying levels of side effects. I wouldn\u2019t really say you\u2019re endangering your health by taking allergy meds. You can also try immunotherapy, but that\u2019s not free. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that having a cat isn\u2019t worth the trade off to you, but is the gf worth the trade off? If she is, see an allergist to discuss your options. \nTry some meds and visit your gf to see how well they work. If it works for you, great move the cat in. If it doesn\u2019t work, she might be more open to leaving the cat with her parents if she knows you really tried to make it work. Or, you break up. \n\nAnyway, NAH.  You both knew about the cat and the allergy at some point. You just have to decide if you\u2019re each worth the trade off. \n\nI do want to add, people are very cavalier about asking someone to take a pill or just live with an allergy. While I do think it\u2019s worth exploring your options, allergy meds aren\u2019t always a simple fix. They do have side effects, they cost money, and they don\u2019t always work. Even mild allergy symptoms can have a significant impact on your life and you don\u2019t know that you won\u2019t get worse after living with the cat long term (or you\u2019ll get better. Immune systems are weird).", "YTA\n\nYou know she has a cat. She has a cat longer than she knows you. And still you suggested that she should abandon her pet? You seriously think that she will do it because of a selfish guy like you? You should have thought about your allergy a lot sooner, not after 2 years.", "I got downvoted last time I made a comment like this but I\u2019ll do it again. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why people start dating knowing their partner has an animal they can\u2019t be around.   The cat must have come up early on. \n\nI have a dog that can\u2019t be around cats.  If I matched with someone that had a cat I would have just moved on to the next person.  I won\u2019t give up my dog and I would not want them to give up the cat.", "Nope. You would be gone. She's had that cat way longer than dating you. You knew she had a cat.", "I used to tell my boyfriends that when the meet the cat and he doesn\u2019t like them, i will have to reconsider the relationship. He didn\u2019t like men but the few I brought home had calm personalities so he was ok with them.  Years later with my now husband, after the cat died, I told my husband. I loved that cat more than anything else in the world. You know I really would have dumped you if the cat didn\u2019t like you.  He said \u201cI know\u201d and i felt understood.  \n\nYou take the family with the girl. In this case you take the cat with the girl.  I am severely allergic to cats. Try Zyrtec and pseudafed.  And dymista or singular.  And keep the cat out of the bedroom.", "I have shitty cat allergies too, just like you describe, but I need to say \u2014 the symptoms you\u2019re describing aren\u2019t \u201cextreme\u201d, they\u2019re textbook. Sure, I hate my cat allergies too \u2014 they\u2019re inconvenient, uncomfortable and they suck, but they are not an \u201cextreme allergy.\u201d An extreme allergy is anaphylaxis, where your throat closes up, you stop breathing, you go into cardiac arrest and you DIE. \n\n(As a parent of an anaphylactic kid, I just want to remind people to keep it real about allergies  \u2014 there\u2019s already enough disbelief, and people making hyperbole doesn\u2019t help those with fatal allergies because they are then disbelieved about the severity.) \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NAH because I think it\u2019s reasonable to not want to be snotty, itchy and allergic constantly AND I think it\u2019s reasonable to not want to give up your pet. \n\nUltimately, if this means you guys can\u2019t live together right now, that\u2019s what it means \u2014 but plz don\u2019t pressure her to give up her cat. A pet is a family member for life.", "INFO what steps have you taken to see if your allergy can be managed? Have you talked to an allergist, or are you just expecting her to sacrifice her cat so you can have her installed in your home?", "YTA. You knew about the cat- why on Earth would you bring up moving in together without figuring this out first?? I get that you don\u2019t want to live with the cat and deal with taking medication, and I\u2019m not judging you for that at all. But she\u2019s had this cat for *seven years*, which is three times longer than she\u2019s been with you. YTA for not thinking this through and coming up with possible solutions just assuming she\u2019d immediately dump her beloved pet at her parents\u2019 in order to jump at the opportunity to live with you.\n\nedit: typo", "YTA.  You knew she had a cat. The cat is 7 so not young or easy to rehome and even if it was what an awful thing for that poor animal. I wouldn\u2019t abandon an animal I loved and I personally would take allergy pills in this situation without hesitation", "I've NEVER seen the comment second pop off this quickly \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nYTA she had the cat before you AND FOR LONGER. She'll have the cat when you're out of the picture. Seriously, take an allergy pill or get allergy shots from a doctor. That is not her problem to deal with", "I would not abandon my pet. I would be unhappy with someone who suggest that I do.", "YTA you knew she had a cat, you knew you were allergic. People and pets are package deals, you don\u2019t get to separate them. Your allergies are your concern, you made the choice to commit to her knowing her cat is an extension of her. Acting like you\u2019re not asking her to abandon her cat because it can stay with her parents is ridiculous. Change the cat to a kid and the logic immediately falls apart. You clearly don\u2019t value pets and realize their importance.", "Cat's at times are very affectionate.  Did the cat hair on her clothing not bother you?\n\nAlso did she have the cat when the two of you started to date?", "NAH, but you do seem to maybe need to rethink some things. There might be room for compromise.\n\nYou can get shots that are perfectly safe, as are antihistamines unless you have specific health conditions already.\n\nYou don't have to do it 'for the rest of your life.' Just as long as you live with this cat. Cats do not live as long as humans, you know.\n\nThe cat has been in her life, every day, a lot longer than you have. I would not be surprised if she chooses not to move in yet but doesn't want to break up.\n\nMy sister is extremely allergic to cats, but she loves them. I had a cat for 20 years. I kept the house clean and always vacuumed floors and furniture the cat was allowed on, and I had a big air purifier in the living area. We learned that if I kept the house clean and my sister washed her hands after touching the cat, she had no problems. If she didn't wash her hands and touched her face, her eyes would swell shut and she would sneeze a ton, etc. \n\nSome options might be to tell her that since it's her cat, she would need to agree to more intense cleaning responsibilities than usual. You could also discuss cat-free zones, like not allowing the cat in the bedroom. If she's not willing to compromise, then I would wait on moving in.", "NAH. \n\nThe two of you are simply not compatible longterm unless or until she decides not to have house cats or you choose intensive allergy treatments.", "YTA. I also have a major cat allergy, which is why I never date people with cats. What was your endgame here?", "Cat wins every time. You're being abandoned dude.\n\nYTA", "Just curious if op has been dating her for 2 years. Is this the first time this topic has come up? Just strange they have never discussed this in the 2 years together.", "Nah \n\nShe said she\u2019d been thinking of talking about moving in together too, so she HAS thought about it, and in her mind, your allergy wasn\u2019t a concern. For her, it\u2019s reasonable for you to take medicine all day to keep your allergies \u2018at bay\u2019.\n\nFor you, it\u2019s reasonable for her to leave her car at her parents since you have a serious allergy (you don\u2019t even go to her place anymore).\n\nI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s really awful here. I think that you both just need to realize that if she won\u2019t leave her cat at her parents, and you won\u2019t have a cat live in your residence, that you probably shouldn\u2019t be living together.", "Pets are a hug part of people's lives. You were aware of the cat and the allergy long before this and the issues should have been discussed so that y'all could talk about solutions. It sounds like y'all need to see other people. NTA but lacking wisdom.", "WHY DID YOU DATE HER if this was going to be a deal breaker??", " YTA.", "YTA for the way you simply expected this to happen without discussing it. There are options: sometimes changing the cat\u2019s diet can mitigate the allergy. You can get sprays and a sort of conditioner to rub into the cat\u2019s fur, both of which help. You can talk to a doctor - pills alone might not cut it, but there are other treatments for allergies as well. Last option would be not moving in together while the cat lives. It might be too late, of course - if someone dismissed my feelings on my pet so easily, I would question if it is the right relationship for me.", "YTA. She has a responsibility to an animal she adopted. You have options for dealing with your allergies that you are unwilling to try. She should abandon you and keep her cat.", "YTA. You knew she had a beloved pet from the start. No pet owner is going to just give up their family member, especially not for someone who is unwilling to compromise or even try to make accommodations.\n\nHer cat is part of the package deal of having her in your life. The same goes for anyone else you know that is a cat owner. You better either not date cat owners or get over your aversion to daily medications usage.\n\nAnd speaking of daily medications, there are many antihistamines out there. Many are non-drowsy. Many have very few side-effects. You can try different ones to find one that works for you. \n\nAs someone who has to take multiple antihistamines daily thanks to an obnoxious autoimmune thing, you sound real pathetic right now, not wanting to even try to accommodate your girlfriend by adding one antihistamine to your daily routine.\n\nThey're low cost and low impact. There's nothing wrong or weird with taking one daily. Millions of people with allergies already do exactly that. You are a person with an allergy who should probably already being doing exactly that. Especially so if you have a supposedly important person in your life that interacts with an allergen that affects you.\n\nBut, from the sound of it, she's not really that important, is she? 'Cause if she actually were important, you would be willing to do this as a compromise for her. The fact that you aren't says way more about you than you realize. And it's not good.", "YTA - at this point, her relationship with the cat is 5 years longer than yours.", "Nah she\u2019s not wrong for not wanting to leave her cats but you\u2019re also not wrong for not wanting to live with one. It sucks but the end of the day you guys might not be compatible.", "YTA,  the cat was there before you. Cats don't live as long as people.  taking meds won't be for the rest of your life. stop being dramatic.", "I hope you use condoms and don't expect her to take hormonal birth control. Those side effects are freaking awful.\n\nIf you do then suck it up", "NAH - just a big waste of time due to not discussing this early on before the relationship became serious. But people tend to ignore incompatibility way too often just because they like someone (I'm guilty of that as well).", "YTA for assuming she would be chill with abandoning an animal she loves for you without so much as a conversation. \n\nThis should have been a conversation that you both approach with love and care, attempting to find a solution. She probably would have reacted differently if you hadn\u2019t just told her the cat couldn\u2019t come with. Obviously she\u2019s going to be upset with you for that. \n\nYou can\u2019t ask someone to abandon their animal for you, while you refuse to do what thousands of people do when they have cat allergies. Perhaps this just won\u2019t work!", "Yeah, YTA. Also anyone who thinks abandoning a pet in the middle of their life is a reasonable thing to do is not a good person as far as I\u2019m concerned. Also, extra negative points for the \u201chey babe.\u201d Ew. No sir.", "There's special cat food you can get that can also help reduce the allergens cats produce. \n\nYou can't ask someone to give up her cat, but if you are serious about it you can find a way to compromise - like you pursuing allergy treatments and your girlfriend changing her cat's diet to the food linked below. \n\nhttps://www.chewy.com/purina-pro-plan-liveclear-adult/dp/302473?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12762206639&utm_content=Purina%20Pro%20Plan&utm_term=&gclid=CjwKCAiAmJGgBhAZEiwA1JZoliNy1s-sOLwAoaywThy7-NYrCbqouv3TQT7ZvBuytGylS7yq8E7tqxoCb_sQAvD_BwE", "You should have considered this issue before bringing up the matter.

Everything was going great in our relationship, so recently I felt like it was time for the next step - for us to start living together. I wanted to ask her to move to my place, since she was living with her parents and there is enough place in my apartment for both of us.  \n\nThe other day we were chilling in my apartment and when it got late she started preparing to go home because she had to attend her college classes the next morning. I told her \"'Hey babe, you don't have to leave anymore if you don't want to\". She asked me what do I mean and that's when I shared my idea for us to start living together. She smiled and said she's been thinking the same thing recently, but didn't want to bring the topic herself. We hugged and I was really glad we are on the same page.\n\nNow here is when things get problematic. My girlfriend has a 7yr old cat that she loves very much. At the same time I have an extreme cat allergy - whenever I get near her cat I start sneezing, my eyes get red and sometimes I even get a rash. That's why I don't even go to her place anymore. So, I told my girlfriend that because of my allergy, she won't be able to bring her cat, and it would be best for her to leave the cat to her parents, they live together anyway, they love her and know how to take care of her.\n\nMy girlfriend was taken aback, she said there were some pills I can take (antihistamine pills) in order to keep my symptoms at bay . I told her I don't want to take these drugs for the rest of my life, as they obviously have some unwanted side effects. We had an argument (believe it or not this was our first serious argument ever), we couldn't reach an agreement so we decided to call it a day.\n\nThis happened 2 days ago and we haven't talked since. I feel bad for asking her to abandon her cat, but at the same time I am not willing to jeopardize my health and well being. It sucks if this causes our relationship to end, but I don't think there is much I can do. So, AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH it sucks for both of you. It\u2019s not like you just don\u2019t like cats and don\u2019t want one in your house, you have an allergy. Personally I think you should try it out with the allergy pills because I have a few friends that were allergic and had to take pills when at their gfs house cuz they had lots of cats and eventually they stopped needing the pills because they weren\u2019t allergic as much/anymore. (My friend had 9 cats at one point and her bf suffered for so long LOL) but it\u2019s really a matter of who\u2019s willing to compromise. Whether you\u2019re willing to tough it out or she\u2019s okay with not living with her cat. Hopefully you guys can come to an agreement but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for asking!", "I'm not here to say if your the ass because I kinda feel like I have similar situations. I'm very allergic to my kitty but she us my baby. If you can't live with the cat I'm sorry but you might have to get a new gf.

I'm not sure what kind of relationship your girlfriend has with the cat but for me I'd rather die then give mine up.", "I'm torn. On one hand, NTA, because it's a genuine health concern, and a valid one imo.\n\nBut on the other hand, YTA, because there are treatments that don't have vast negative side effects, and there's even one that I believe is injections for...two years? And then you don't have to take anything and don't have the allergies again. My aunt did this when she was younger because of the same issue (cat allergy) and has never had issues with cats since.", "EHS because both assume that you are right without actually talking with each other. I have some allergies and understand that even if medicine can't make you functional isn't always a solution on the long run, besides the secondary effects there is an economic factor. Also your girlfriend shouldn't assume that taking pills is the best for you. On the other hand you are disregarding your girlfriend's feelings for her cat, she knows the cat for longer than you you can't assume she gladly leave her cat for you, also whatever arrangements for the cat should be her choice not yours. \n\n\nBy the way the conversation about the cat should happen before the actual invitation for leaving together. Just to explore the options you both have. I think there is plenty of opportunities to compromise, there is also the possibility that this is the end.", "YTA", "O-kay... There are allergy drugs that are not antihistamines and don't cause side effects. You are not even willing to consult an allergist for advice? This isn't going to work.

My bf was allergic to cats too but he never asked me to abandon my cat when we moved in together. He started taking medication and in 6 months his allergy was completely gone, he could stop taking antihistamines. I heard this is how it usually goes, cat allergy is something that doesn't stick with you for life.", "Ugh. Look into allergy shots. I would NEVER give up my cat for someone who strung me along for two years with this idea in their head that I would. YTA for your approach. \u201cWell you should move in but leave your beloved pet with your parents\u201d is way different from \u201cI want you to move in. We both know I have this allergy.

How do you manage if she comes over and her clothes have the cat dander? \nAlso have you had a conversation about life post kitty?

Could she imagine a world without her having a car when this one passes? \nIf you have done nothing to try to make this ok or discuss in the past and medically there is not an issue with you taking allergy meds and just want her to give up her cat to move in then you are coming across as the AH\u2026", "YTA for not discussing your allergies with GF. And YTA for expecting GF to rehome a 7 year old cat to move in with you. This should have been discussed!", "NAH.  Each of you has an alternative option to what you\u2019re asking of the other one, but neither of you is willing to make the sacrifice in order to live together.  Neither of you is wrong for making that choice, but also it\u2019s a pretty clear sign that both of you have higher priorities than your relationship. Better to know that before moving in together.", "YTA for dating a cat person when you're allergic to cats. YTA for asking someone to leave their pet they've had for 7 years that will likely live another 7-10 years, if not more.\n\nI have indoor/outdoor allergies. I take a daily antihistamine ( 24hr Claritin ) with my daily multivitamin and have no issues. If you're not willing to do that, or your allergies are truly so severe that a pill or shot won't work, then break up with her.\n\nAnd when you sign back up for dating sites, make sure to say no cat ladies. We don't like having our time wasted.", "NAH. One possible compromise: you could start the process of allergy shots. The cat could live with her parents until the process is done. My husband used to have severe allergies and took antihistamines when he couldn\u2019t avoid cats or other allergens (he was allergic to dogs as well \u2014 along with many other things). But even ignoring side effects, the antihistamines didn\u2019t work well enough to be a permanent solution. He\u2019d take them before a event at my pet-owning relatives\u2018 house, and they would allow him to be there for a while but the exposure would build up and eventually the reaction would break through, even though he kept up with the dosage schedule. There is no way he could have lived with a cat. Even if you were willing to take the drugs, having a cat in your own home would simply be too much exposure. Your GF probably doesn\u2019t understand these limitations; a lot of people don\u2019t. But the shots were different. They were like a miracle. We actually have a dog now and being in a home with cats doesn\u2019t bother him. He hasn\u2019t needed Claritin or anything like that in years. It takes a long time (18 months maybe?) and requires commitment, but you would be free from this allergy forever, which would be a nice thing, whatever happens with your relationship. And once you are doing the process, they test for and treat all your allergies, so if you also have hay fever or something like that, you won\u2019t get it anymore either.", "NAH but have you looked into other solutions like allergy shots?  They sometimes can eradicate an allergy entirely. Worth doing some research potentially for other solutions. That being said, the title is misleading since she wouldn\u2019t be abandoning the cat, it would be with her parents where she can visit whenever she wants.", "YTA, but only for assuming she would get rid of her cat for you. You should have thought about/discussed this before asking her to move in! She\u2019s had the cat the whole time you\u2019ve been together, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise for you. It was inconsiderate, and you should probably apologise for suggesting/assuming she would ditch her beloved pet for your sake. Pets are family.\n\nI do understand that medication and shots aren\u2019t always the answer though. I\u2019m personally on three different medications for my allergies and have also done three years of immunotherapy shots, and guess what? I still have terrible reactions to all the things I\u2019m allergic to. If I forget my meds it\u2019s WORSE, but even with them I\u2019m still in discomfort (or even agony) most days. Some people just don\u2019t have any luck with medical interventions. I would definitely suggest you TRY some other stuff before giving up, but certainly don\u2019t move in together unless it\u2019s fully resolved. Failing that, just wait. Cats don\u2019t live forever.", "NAH. She rightfully wants to keep her cat and you rightfully don't want to deal with your cat allergies. The other question is whether she is always going to want a cat when this one passes. You both have a tough decision and this may be a dealbreaker. For those who are saying deal with the antihistamines, some allergies get worse as you get older. My brother grew up in a household with cats (no more than 2 at a time) first it was red eyes and rashes and even with treatment, over time, he wound up not being able to breathe around cats. Which was such a shame because he loved them so much. So there is no blame here.", "YTA. You knew she had a cat prior to broaching the topic of moving in. You made a \"plan\" for that cat's future without actually ASKING your GF (\"the cat can stay with your parents honey, I've already thought about this\"), you made a \"plan\" for that cat's future without actually asking your GFs parents (\"I know it's GF's cat but it's yours now!), you, presumably, have not pursued allergy management with a doctor beyond general OTC allergy meds before any of this - even though you KNEW YOUR GF HAD A CAT. If you choose not to discuss options with your doctor - that's fine but then you and GF shouldn't live together until Mr. Meow Meow passes away...", "Small YTA for the way you brought it into the conversation. There was no discussion, no compromise in your way of telling it so you left her with only two choices : 1) not live with you 2) abandon her cat. \n\nYou need to learn how to brought an important conversation before you move in together or your going to have many problems ahead.", "INFO: Does being around your gf set off your allergy? Like, her clothes, hair, car, etc.? \n\nPerhaps you're not as allergic as you think?", "YTA that cat has seniority to you in her life.\n\nBUT to address your lil remark on not wanting to take pills for unwanted side effects just for your comfort. Is she taking BC? If so, youre being not only an AH, but a massively hypocritical one at that bub", "NAH. No one should force you to take medicine and no one should force your GF to give away her cat. Maybe moving in together permanently is not the way to go. I get the cat has a home but the bonds between them are not easily replaceable.", "NAH\n\nMy wife and I had the same situation. Her mom took the cat. I literally couldn\u2019t live with a cat my allergies were so bad.", " No judgement here for anyone, I think it sucks for everyone. You don\u2019t want to be miserable and she doesn\u2019t want to give up a loved family pet.", "YTA: you knew about the pet before you asked her and expected her to magically know you wouldn\u2019t want it here. If you don\u2019t have pets, y it can be forgiven for not understanding the bond. But she has had this cat for over twice the length she has had you in her life. A little Claritin will be fine, and if you live with the cat, you are likely to adjust to it. Like a kid, an animal is a life long commitment. You don\u2019t get rid of it because it\u2019s suddenly inconvenient, what you are asking is cruel to both her and the cat. You have a choice:take the allergy meds, or kiss relationship goodbye.", "NAH. You don't want to take antihistamines and she doesn't want to abandon her cat. Seems you two aren't compatible.", "YTA. You *knew* she had a cat, and you asked her to live with you knowing full well she had said cat.", "YTA. Of course, you\u2019re wrong for assuming she\u2019ll get rid of her cat. However, you\u2019re also TA because you have been dating her for TWO YEARS and you\u2019ve seemingly never talked about any of this. How have you dated her for so long and you\u2019ve never mentioned what she\u2019d do with the cat if you moved in together? Also, it seems your first time bringing up moving in together is just telling her not to leave one night, which is bad communication. You and your GF are incompatible and you need to learn to communicate better for your next relationship so you don\u2019t waste another 2+ years on a relationship before realizing it\u2019s not going to work out.", "This is NAH but leaning toward YTA. You guys had 2 years to discuss this. Both of you should have discussed it but it is your allergy so you should have been the one to find a solution. You can't just expect someone to give up their animal point blank. If you expect her to chose between her cat or you, you might not like who she picks.", "I'm gonna say no assholes here. I can see both sides. I also had pets and leaving them when I moved in with my boyfriend broke my heart to the point of not wanting to ever have pets again (the circumstances were different than yours tho, my boyfriend's allergies are managable). At the same time, I sympathize with you not wanting to take medicine because od side effects. I sincerely hope you can figure things out.", "YTA. you knew she wanted her cat with her. You also said you \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take these drugs for the rest of your life\u201d but let\u2019s be real. It\u2019s a cat. It will unfortunately die long before you. Why are you so against the anti-histamines?", "NAH, with slight YTA.\n\nI am severely allergic to cats and no pills, shots, etc will take that away. Cats make me miserable and I cannot be around them, after so long I actually have breathing issues. She can\u2019t assume pills will fix the issue for you.\n\nThat said, she also can\u2019t be expected to give her pet up and that\u2019s why I said maybe slight YTA for you assuming it would be easy for her to do so.\n\nThis may be a dealbreaker, as unfortunate as it is.", "NAH.\n\nYou have an allergy and while I don\u2019t think at least trying the meds to see if they help is a big deal, that\u2019s your choice. But I also would never leave my pet with my parents to move in with a guy. Never ever. That\u2019s just not a compromise I could handle.", "The reason this can only be YTA for me is because you automatically assumed she'd be getting rid of her cat and started a fight over it. If your question was \"AITA for not wanting to live with a cat when I'm allergic?\" then I could see n a h votes, but in terms of the actual question you're asking and how you acted, then yes, definitely YTA. Big difference between pre-deciding that she'll be getting rid of the cat without her input and having a conversation about how living arrangements could work.\n\nEDIT: Also, your post title says \"asking\" but the post itself was you telling her she'd be doing that.", "YTA for not considering this before you asked her to move in or try to come up with alternatives instead of an ultimatum for your GF.", "I'm in between NAH and YTA. \n\nNAH: After owning a cat for over 2 years I suddenly developed a pretty bad allergy to him. Had to try different allergy medicines until something worked for me (Zyrtec) until the condition went away on its own ~6 months later. The thing is I had to take the pill every single morning or I'd be tearing non-stop throughout the day. So, from your perspective, I understand not wanting to committ to taking medicine for who knows how long. From her perspective, I wouldn't want to let my cat go at all either. Btw, cat is still with me 10 years later and the crazy allergies come back every few years and then go away after some months.\n\nYTA: If you really cared about her, you'd have already known how much she loves the cat. So why even bother offering to move in with you if you would put that condition?", "NAH, but it's best you don't move in together. She loves her pet, you love breathing.", "YTA. Why would you tell her to move in if you're allergic to cats? Why would you assume she's going to get rid of her companion she's had for seven years??? Yall don't sound compatible. For the record, my sister had a cat for years before meeting her husband who is allergic. He never expected her to get rid of her cat when they moved in together, he just made the adjustment by taking pills and my sister brushed the cat regularly and used an anti-enzyme powder on his fur. It can be done if you actually want to live with your girlfriend but you need to understand that she has a commitment to her kitty companion before she does you. I hope she doesn't get rid of her cat for you.", "YTA. You knew she had a cat and you knew you were allergic. That cat was here before you and will be here after you.", "NAH, but I strongly recommend you not die on this hill: you WBTA if you did, and especially if you stand on that \"there's not much I can do\" line (which is truly false).  \n\nBecause you WILL lose this battle.  Asking people to give up loved animals is like asking them to give up children, and you don't want to be in that competition. \n\nAntihistamines and other allergy meds (and especially shots, which are cheap and effective) are not onerous.  But hold off on the moving-in thing until you can come to an agreement.", "NAH - You've reached an impasse, it's one thing to be emotionally ready to live with someone and be compatible roommates.\n\nThe situation around the cat is just of of many topics that need to be discussed before either of you should commit to moving in together. \n\nYou're asking her to get rid her cat and her asking you to take antiallergy medicine are both practical solutions to the problem and suggesting them in the course of discussion is appropriate.", "YTA.\n\nI understand where you are coming from as I have similar symptoms when I'm exposed to most cats.

Even if it means leaving it at their parents house, where it will be cared for. \n\nYour options are\u2026.\n1) don\u2019t move in until the cat passes away 2) break up 3) Take drugs 4) leave the cat at the parents. \n\nYou know this, they know this, pick an option.", "YTA, that cat is family and came before you.\n\nIt would be a massive red flag to me if my partner abandoned an animal for any reason - so I\u2019m shocked you think it\u2019s ok to tell her she needs to. \n\nTo those saying allergy pills are impossible to live with daily - tell that to the millions who take them daily just to be able to leave their house without imploding. \n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to take allergy pills and you think she should give up the living, breathing, animal she loves for your convenience you should leave her to find someone who wouldn\u2019t put her in that position.", "No one is the asshole here. Is that an option? Anyways, she is right to not want to give up a member of the family; her child. That is how many pet owners feel about their pet. \n\nSo it seems you have two options; don't live together, or take those pills. It's okay for married couples to not live together. It's not weird at all and the only reason people think otherwise is society.", "YTA. \n\nMy husband has a serious cat allergy. When we met, I had a cat who had been with me for years and years. He took antihistamines when he stayed with me and when we began talking about living together, he started looking into allergists who could help him manage his allergy through the rest of my cats life. \n\nSadly, my cat was in the twilight years and died before we ever combined households. \n\nWhat never came up was that I should leave my cat. A pet is a lifetime commitment barring extreme circumstance. A pet is also family. You\u2019ve asked her to ditch her companion of seven years for you. That cat has you beat by 5 years.

Never. Their animal is a living being who's part of their life, it's incredibly rude from you to ask this. And when you're the owner, you should make sure the other have understood that your animal is part of the deal + talk about the animals you may have in the future.\n\nNow, for your situation, there are other solutions than pills : exposure therapy, for example.

Now from her end it isn\u2019t a good look either but she likely assumed that because you committed it was never going to be a question of her giving up her pet and that you\u2019d find a compromise other than that outcome.

Over the last few years they\u2019ve taken allergy tablets and found ways of coping with cats in the household and now barely react to them at all and don\u2019t need those meds everyday.

Here are some of the compromises and solutions my partner and I discussed that will hopefully help you:\n\n- we rent an apartment that has an extra room that will remain cat-free, so he always has a sanctuary of sorts that is free of allergens. \n\n- we clean regularly, and it is my responsibility to dust as well as brush out my cats on a regular basis. \n\n- cats are not allowed in the bedroom so he can sleep soundly. \n\n- no more cats after my current cats pass on. \n\nIt's the best we could do. He will need to take antihistamines probably on a regular basis, but antihistamines are generally speaking safe. In the end, we both want to live together badly, and my cats aren't going anywhere, so it was either this or wait a decade until I am cat-less to move in. \n\nI hope this helps you navigate it.", "You are not asking your GF to abandon her cat. The cat lives with her parents and I assume would not be kicked out if she moves out.

Then this scenario would likely be avoided . YTA for how you dealt with the situation.", "NAH but I do want to add that over the counter allergy meds are a compromise worth considering. I know because I take store-brand Allegra every day (24 hour dose) and have for nearly 10 years. I have zero side effects and it lets me keep my cat, whom I didn't know I was allergic to until I adopted her.\n\nYour symptoms are pretty typical. When I'm not medicated, my symptoms are the same as you describe. (That's how I know I've forgotten a dose lol.) I don't think you should be pressured to follow this path if you don't want to, but it's worth considering. You could try a few doses while visiting the cat. \n\nI also think cat staying with parents is a decent compromise. It would be hard & sad for her, but she's not losing it and the cat would keep its current home. It sounds like she wouldn't be that far away from it.  But I understand if she doesn't want to do that.\n\nI think both of you have understandable hesitations. NAH, you just each need to choose which sacrifice you're willing to live with.", "I understand you both...She doesn't want to abandon her cat and you have really bad allergies. Keep in mind you offered for you guys to stay together. I just think this conversation should have happened awhile ago regarding her cat what the plan should be if you choose to live together.

I think you gave a good compromise, but your girlfriend is also right to feel hurt about it since that cat\u2019s been in her life for 7 years. You guys are simply incompatible. I think it\u2019s a bit strange that you never discussed your allergies with her knowing that you\u2019re allergic to the exact being she has. Obviously you can\u2019t know that you were going to move in together so early in the relationship, but you couldn\u2019t have possibly thought that she would abandon her cat for you since it\u2019s clear from your post that she\u2019s super attached to it. I think the best course of action is to break up since you don\u2019t want to take allergy meds and the cat is simply her family.", "I don't think you guys are adorable for each other.", "Obviously I don\u2019t know how bad your allergy is even with your description as I don\u2019t experience it. So take this information with grains of salt. I own a dog breed that is known for shedding a shit ton. My fianc\u00e9 was allergic as well and moved in knowing that removing my pet was not an option. Now his allergies were things like watering eyes, stuffy nose, and itching. \n\nThere are options such as hypoallergen shampoo/sprays and pills of course as you mentioned. I also wanted to mention that it is possible that over time your body will adjust to that specific pet\u2019s dander. Of course this period of time is miserable, I won\u2019t lie on that! For my fianc\u00e9 it took him about two months or so, but his body adjusted. He used to not be able to even pet my dog without his hand getting itchy and his nose getting stuffy, but now he would be able to bathe in her shedded fur.\n\nLong story short, if the cat leaving is not an option at all for your girlfriend.

Asking her to give up her cat is a bit unreasonable. 2) and this is the reason why I\u2019m bordering on ESH, neither of you thought to actually discuss what moving in together would entail. You want her to move in, she\u2019s been wanting to ask but didn\u2019t, neither of you really thought about the outcome and all possibilities in the scenario. \n\nNow I do agree that it would suck balls to be on allergy medications for as long as you guys are together, the side effects aren\u2019t great and it would cause some serious liver damage. But there are other options to deal with your allergies. I recommend sitting down and speaking with your gf about it, reaching out to either an allergy specialist or your primary physician to see if there are other routes you can take, like allergy shots, which are taken over time to reduce or even stop allergies. There are other options besides being stuck taking Claritin for the rest of your relationship and if you want your gf to live with you, you need to step up and explore the other routes before telling her to leave her cat behind. I\u2019m sure you both love and care for each other, and I hope this doesn\u2019t cause the end of your relationship, but you need to reach out to her, apologize and let her know you still want her to live with you, but that you\u2019d be willing to explore other options besides medications so she doesn\u2019t need to part with her pet.

Why didn\u2019t you have this conversation before you offered to have her move in?? The vast majority of people will choose their long-time pet over a much shorter relationship.

Birth control pills (which are also sometimes prescribed for other reasons, such as to smooth out bad periods or even to help with acne) are a really good solution for some women; for others, much less so.  For some people taking daily allergy meds is a really good solution; for others, much less so.  \n\nI would never give up my cats, either -- but then, I would never get romantically serious about anyone who didn't want to live with cats.

My partners very similar with his allergy to cats as op, when we moved the cats in with us he was able to stop taking the antihistamines after a while, he only has issues now if he's away from the house for a while, or if he's accidently scratched.  If they're serious together surely it'd be worth a try? And if not address it then as least a compromise was attempted?", "I agree with your position mostly but an average lifespan for an indoor cat is 12-18 years and this cat is only 7 years old. It is not uncommon for cats to live into their 20\u2019s. The cat is not elderly for a few years yet. Waiting for the cat to die is not a great plan either.", "Already elderly?  They can live for 20+ years.  This cat could have 13+ years left.", "And you\u2019ve always been incompatible\u2026 in two years y\u2019all never had this conversation?

I understand it really sucks having an allergic reaction, I have a friend who is heavily allergic and we keep some prescription meds at my flat for when he comes over, but I've seen the reaction. I do understand its tough, and it would be fair enough if you didn't want to live with a cat. But literally don't date someone with cats in the first place. I would never ever get rid of my cat for anything. I would sure appreciate someone giving it a trial run with all the meds etc first, and if it didn't work, you'd just have to accept living apart. I also had a houseshare a few years ago where someone moved in with allergies (it was very cheap rent and he was willing to sacrifice the allergies for the low cost) and we kept their room completely cat free and after about 8 months, he had got used to the cat mostly and started letting him into his room.\n\nETA: basically its the expectation that she gets rid of the cat that makes OP TA. A discussion first, and trying to find a solution should be step 1. Don't ever *expect* someone to get rid of a beloved pet. So YTA.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but at the same time she had the cat for 7 years. He knew she had the cat.

Cat allergies are no joke, when I lived with a cat I had a 3 humidifiers, an air purifier, and I had to take allergy pills. I couldn\u2019t be around the cat or my throat would close and I\u2019d have to get my inhaler. It\u2019s not a simple \u201cachew\u201d\u2014it\u2019s itchy eyes, problems breathing, all of that.  Visiting someone is a different thing, you can bear it\u2014but to be living is a whole different thing and OP is in the right to address his allergies", "As with many medications, side effects vary from person to person. I have severe animal allergies and often take Zyrtec or Claritin. Both give me unpleasant side effects such as nosebleeds and (extremely) dry mouth. I also have taken allergy shots (for years). With both the shots and the pills, I can stay in a house with a cat for about three hours maximum before I am miserable. It\u2019s great that these things work for your husband, but you can\u2019t assume they work for everyone.", "Not true of all people.  I find they make me very lethargic and foggy.  In older adults, use of antihistamines is correlated with increased risk of dementia.

He'd be having a reaction to his GF if that were the case.", "Some people do experience unpleasant side effects from allergy pills. Zyrtec can cause depression, others can cause tiredness/lethargy, etc. And some just aren't as effective as others on the individual level.\n\nHowever, it is extremely unlikely that OP has side effects to all of the allergy medication out there. He should try a few varieties to see if what works for him.", "Different people have different reactions to the same medicine. I don\u2019t get side effects from zyrtec but I know lots of people who get drowsy and dry mouth with it.", "It doesn't sound like he tried antihistamines at all. He just doesn't go to her place and that's his 'solution'. Just like her getting rid of the cat is the only solution he even considered. \n\nIt's a problematic situation, no easy answers here.

No, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to live like that everyday. \n\nSome pairings just aren\u2019t practical, and it isn\u2019t for a lack of love.

Or, possibly, a different allergen.\n\nRegardless, step one is to talk to an allergy specialist before yeeting the whole cat. It\u2019s possible that he can\u2019t live with one.
