She recognized me and said she thought she saw a ghost for a minute. So she just did a bit of small talk (what we've been up to, asked how moms bf was doing since moms bf and her dad were friends,  things like that), then said nobody has heard anything from me since high school (left in 2009). I told her that once I handed my last exam, pass or fail I wasn't going back (I was 20). \n\nThen she said that she didn't see me at the prom or graduation, to which I said I didn't go. She asked why and I told her I had had enough of the system/bullying that I was just done with it. She then started to call me a few racial terms (acadian) and a few insults since I didn't go to the reunions or anything, and I told her I was completely done with anything to do with the school.\n\nShe then said it was a d!ck move not to even have anybody from school on my fb, or joined any group to at least let everybody know was still alive, especially with the rapid weight loss and feeling sick more than half the time, and that everybody was worried. I told her that nobody messaged me anywhere to even asked, and if they wanted nothing to do with me back then why do they want anything to do with me now. She then told me, in tears that \"she would've gone\", and I told her that it had bad idea written all over it (she was impressionable around the other bullies). She then just slammed the latch (lock) on the door as she left and peeled her tires out of the parking lot, so after that made me think if I was wrong at all.

If she was so worried, she should have reached out.", "I don\u2019t think she was stalking you, of course. She came there by happenstance, but crap, Dear, why make you feel uncomfortable? You are obviously being fair minded.", "I understand. I meant it more as a general thing. However,  she still doesn't understand that you are no longer going to put yourself in a situation to be mocked or bullied. Before it was school, you had to go. You didn't/don't have to go to all those other events. She also doesn't seem to be remorseful in her previous behavior. She alone is worth staying away from.", "Thanks!  BTW, this classmate sounds unhinged. I can't imagine anyone from my HS giving AF if someone lost contact. I am a different generation, though. Maybe that makes a difference?", "Idk if she feels remorseful or not since we did have cordial meetings that summer, but she was probably more upset and felt like I hadn't truly moved on afterwards. It's not so much that I haven't forgiven everyone, or really haven't moved on, but so much as I'm just not stupid enough to pit myself back in those situations.", "Maybe, she was 2-3 years younger than me and an athlete, while I was mostly a gamer since mom never allowed me to go to functions anyway.

Don\u2019t give them the time if day.

The more bilingual end anyway", "I live in moncton, but went to school in bouctouche/ste marie de kent", "I had a feeling.  I dated a NB Acadian and people are rude up in the bilingual areas, mostly the anglophones.  Dude don't even waste a thought on her or anyone else. Clearly your decision was best. Gtfo is all NB is good for.", "I wouldn\u2019t pay attention to her. Sounds like she has failed to move on from school. For god\u2019s sake you\u2019ve been out of high school over twice as long as you were in it at this point. She either needs a hobby or some therapy.", "I have a love/hate relationship with it. I'd never really able to forge a life anywhere else, but I hate a lot of the stuff around (harder to make money, health care sucks, you need to run 3 p/t jobs and such). The only upside is the cheaper housing and it's easier to strike up conversations. It's almost like Stockholm syndrome, especially with the Irving's.", "I probably need both as well, but I just really mellowed out", "Oh man I can relate. Nova Scotian here.

My husband and I are struggling, so it's good you have your place paid off, that's great!", "Our living wage is about 19, while minimum wage is 13.75$ iirc.

Who really talks to people from HS unless they were super close? I talk to no one from HS.

I keep in touch with my college friends very much since we're much closer", "NTA. Tell her to move around and you don't owe her an explanation for shit.", "NTA.  Her response was exactly why you haven\u2019t kept in touch with anyone.  Good riddance.", "NTA....  I did the same thing.  I walked out and never looked back. I friends with one person", "NTA, this is a two-way street, and you are right; why should it all be on you to reach out to everyone? If she was so concerned, why didn't she reach out to you? She feels bad about her actions but doesn't want to accept that she's at fault as well, so she's trying to throw it on you.", ">NTA. She insulted you and then wondered why you didn't want to stay in touch.\n\nThis is what I was thinking!  Her immediate go-to was racist insults but she can't think of any reason why he wouldn't have stayed in touch...\n\nIf only you lived in South Africa, you could report her to the police.  Abusing someone with racist terms in a situation where they can't just walk away (eg, when you are at your job minding the till) is a crime.", "Same, I have like maybe 3 friends that I don't even talk to but still have on just for the sake of it. We were all friends out of hs (one I met through my hair dresser, another was a family friend and another we met after hs but we graduated 1 year apart), and I think it's the only reason I have them there", "I wasn't that attractive or likeable then and I'm even less attractive and likeable now. \n\nJk, maybe she was, but to be fair she never hid anything from anyone. Although she was nice and decent, if she liked or didn't like anyone she wasn't shy on saying it", "One of my biggest pet peeves is people who can't own up to their mistakes/faults so I have an amazing amount of respect for you for posting this response.  Regardless of anything, you have been out of school for a while and have every right to choose what kind of contact, if any, you want to have with anybody, as you are an adult.", "I was a testosterone filled mess, picking fights with anything that moved, with a very short fuse. I got beat up more often than not, but once I was gone I just started getting more and more calm to the point I can't even watch people fight out of controlled areas anymore.", "Nta, you do you, don't make any time for those people.", "NTA - \u201cHonestly, this interaction is reminding me why I did all that, and it\u2019s still the right choice.\u201d", "Info: Is it possible this is someone who had a crush on you/romantic interests?

I stay in touch with only 1 person from my class.", "Awfully dramatic for someone who hasn\u2019t tried to get in touch for 14 years.

You're doing fine living the way you want.\n\nNo one's heard from me in years either but no one would make such a big deal and call me names if they found me either.\n\nLooks like she hasn't moved on.", "Was it a small school?"]}
