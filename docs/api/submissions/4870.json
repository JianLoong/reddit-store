I can understand my gran, she doesn't drive and my grandad was diagnosed with dementia recently but as a family we made the decision to take his car away a couple of years ago as we were pretty sure then that he had dementia and his driving was becoming more erratic and dangerous. So I'm more than happy to drive and visit my gran, I'm just expected to visit everyone while I'm through because my mum won't drive for an hour to come and see me. I've lived in my flat for 5 years and my mums been here twice ( neither time she drove)", "I can understand my mum not wanting it brought up, but my gran knows what my stepdads like and what he's been like ever since my mum met him so she wasn't surprised when the truth came out.

When I was 21 I found out my fiance had stolen all the money from our joint savings account that was supposed to pay for our wedding, shortly after I lost my job so my dad told me I was welcome to come stay with him and clear my head for a bit. My stepdad took the huff and told me if I left I wasn't welcome to come home but I thought he was bluffing so I stayed with my dad for a couple of weeks and then came home to find all my belongings in black bags on my mums doorstep :/", "Not a particularly nasty person but still kicked you out your home at 21!

I hope things get better", "Oh FUCK that dude", "Right, that's what I'm saying.  It's possible to say the truth and still be wrong for it.  I was commenting on how they said you're NEVER the AH for telling the truth.  If it's unnecessary to say and it's not kind to say it, you're still an AH if you say it even if it's true.\n\nLike when I was 7 or 8 and a really pudgy kid, I walked into a room and my grandmother says to me \"that's the way fat men wear their pants\".  She wasn't lying, but she was an AH for saying it.  She got so pissed about my reply of \"that's the way grandmas lose their teeth\".  Fun times.", "Honestly, when it comes to family there is such a rabbit Warren of events that when i sit and think about it all I just want to cut off contact with both sets of parents. However I don't believe they are bad people and I can't imagine not having my mum and dad in my life no matter how they treat me", "The weird thing is, I don't have a bad relationship with my stepdad. We are perfectly civil to each other and I'm always made to feel welcome at their home. It's just whenever my dad is involved in anything that tempers flare up.", "My ex or my stepdad? :L", "Now see, I\u2019m the type that would\u2019ve laughed that off with an admission that I\u2019d just been charred to a crisp.", ">It's possible to say the truth and still be wrong for it.\n\nThis is probably a semantic thing. Because my point is you wouldn't be wrong \"because you told the truth,\" you'd be wrong *because you said something unnecessary* or *because you said something unkind*.\n\nThose two possible reasons aren't \"because you told the truth.\"\n\nYou're sliding the actual cause of *why* you're wrong onto another facet of the situation that occurred simultaneously. This is a common thing in language, you're not alone in doing it, but I believe in specificity.\n\n**Edit to add:** What you're doing is kind of like reverse gaslighting. If some jerk had said \"all I'm doing is telling the truth\" when they were being cruel and unnecessary, your *actual* issue is that they were being cruel and unnecessary, and they're trying to gaslight one thing over to another and pretend that you have no reason to be mad at them because what they said is true. They lie when they say that's \"all\" they're doing.\n\n**Edit again to add:** You may be treating the statement \"because you told the truth\" as an *indirect* cause; because they told the truth, it allowed them the opportunity to be unkind, and thus the direct cause: because they were unkind, they were in the wrong. And your argument could be \"if they had never told the truth then the opportunity to be unkind would not have existed.\"\n\nBut it is this separation between *direct* and *indirect* causes that I want to be super specific about because indirect causes happen all the time and we shouldn't ever actually lay the blame on those because that can get messy *real* quick. Identifying the true and actual cause is a much more precise way to resolve and heal things.", "I get that. I am still in contact with my family as well. Even though things happened that would be a very good reason to cut certain members completely out. \n\nDoesn't mean you don't deserve better.", "Yes", "Both! I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been through that.", "I would do the same now, but there was no way I was laughing that off as a young kid suffering through my own shame about my body.", "Thank you.

Maybe ask your family to make the effort more often to come over?", "NTA. \n\nThey're not upset that you were kicked out, they're upset that you told the truth on what happened and now everyone knows they lied. \n\nAlso, if everyone missed you and wanted to see you, they would invite you. \n\nSounds like your mom might have been saying a lot more than just you left on your own, if no one invited you to anything other than a holiday.", "NTA - that being said you\u2019re only an hour away, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in England or something (just based on how my English cousins act) but an hour drive is a day trip where I\u2019m from.

Trying to blame the truth itself for why the action was mean, instead of the cruelty with which that truth was delivered, is basically gaslighting.\n\nTo me, the issue is with the action of telling.  I wouldn\u2019t say the truth is to blame, but telling it may be depending on the situation.  In my mind, the action of telling encompasses some of the other aspects that you keep separate - outing, etc.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t include cruelty in that, by the way.  The decision to tell or not tell is separate from the manner in which you tell, so I would make that distinction.  That feels coherent and sensible to me, but may not to you.\n\nI think our difference of interpretation is most clear here:\n\n> In all of those situations, the problems arise from [snip] providing information that is unnecessary to do so. That is the reason those actions are rude. Not because truth is inherently rude to communicate to another person.\n\nI don\u2019t see a difference from providing information and telling.  That the information is true is a separate issue from its necessity or crucially the harm telling it causes.\n\nIn any case, with the clarification you gave I feel like I understand what you mean.  I don\u2019t think your interpretation is inherently correct in a way mine isn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t want to argue with you that it\u2019s inherently wrong.\n\n> Either way, I left my statement incomplete because it wasn't relevant to this issue, and simply clarified myself in the replies, like I'm doing now.

Truth is real, truth is reality, truth is by definition what is correct and right. Even in cases of outing this absolutism would still be a part of my answer, just not the entirety of it as it was in this case.\n\nIt's like if I say \"red is red\" in a discussion about things that are red, and you say \"other conversations have both red and yellow in them, and yellow isn't red\", and you're right, but it doesn't make \"red is red\" not an absolute.

It\u2019s ridiculous for them to say that your village is too far away from them. I bet that your family have never left their village. Be the person who goes out and experiences life\u2026 further than 1 village over\u2026", "NTA you're mum is the asshole for her spineless entitlement.", "NTA gran asked you, and you answered if she's so ashamed about it. Maybe she should have stood up for you instead of letting you get kicked out", "No, of course not. NTA", "NTA\n\nSucks when the lies they\u2019ve been telling get exposed and people get pissed at them for being AHs but that isn\u2019t your problem OP.", "NTA. I am sorry you are in this situation. The whole thing stinks. Your mom is TA for getting cross with you for telling a truth you had no idea you needed to hide\u2026 she never even asked you not to say anything! (Not that it would have been ok anyway)\n\nYour mom should be grateful you\u2019ve set her free from a lie she\u2019s been keeping for 10 years. Lying is too much work. \n\nIn the words of my Granddaddy: Baby, the truth will set you free, but it will ruin your day first. \n\nSo your mum\u2019s day was ruined \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nShe\u2019ll get over it, or she won\u2019t, either way it isn\u2019t your problem. \n\nBest of luck with your hiking group! Good on you for seeking therapy, I hope it allows you to set clear and healthy boundaries with family when you move back. \n\nAs someone who used to make herself small for the comfort of others, and no longer does because of therapy (I\u2019ve even become a therapist now \ud83d\ude09) I APPLAUD YOU! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nif it can be destroyed by the truth it deserves to be destroyed.\n\nit being the lie your mother told your gran", "It depends. Alot of people do but then others move out as soon as they can or move into student accommodation when they are at university. I have another friend who lived with her mum until she was 29", "Nta. It's not your fault they lied", "NTA\n\nShe got caught in her lies. Then acts angry for a choice she made.", "Totally NTA!! Sounds like you should have talked to Grandma before moving an hour away!", "NTA", "Nta\n\nShame on your mum for backing your AH sted dad. Good that they got shamed for this.", "I am blown away that an hours drive is 'too far to visit'. An hour drive here is nothing, it takes 8 hours to leave the state.\n\nCrazy Europeans!", "The dead still tell stories! Don't you watch NCIS?", "# BOT, DOWNVOTE AND REPORT", "He kicked you out for staying with your dad? Were you supposed to disown your father because you got a new stepdaddy? Ick.", "This has got to be Europe. I drive almost an hour for WORK.\n\nBut on topic, your mom is now dealing with the repercussions of lying to protect your stepdad. She has no one to blame but herself, and it seems she knew that it was wrong to begin with. NTA", "NTA.  You had no reason to play along with the lie.  If the truth makes someone look bad, maybe that someone should think about why that is.", "NTA. You told the truth.", "Hell no... NTA here. Actually you did have a choice, you should have spoken up 10 years ago. Time you lost out on. But at 21, did you know you had a choice?", "NTA. But I think the family you assume to be very close with is.\n\n>I'm too far away that **my family never come and visit me**, and I'm too far away that I don't get included in last minute plans. My aunt, gran and younger cousin (f23) are forever going out for lunch or coffee but I never get invited to these outings. Of course any significant family event I'm there for.\n\nFor 10 years now you live one hour away instead of 10 minutes and they never bothered to visit you. That's horrible. They exclude you and never invite you, because you live \"too far\" away, taking away your choice to be there and making the one hour trip to enjoy time with them.\n\nI don't think that a family that purposely excludes you because of your \"choice\" to live in a town that's almost an hour drive away is a very nice one. To me it seems like they have been (passive-agressively) punishing you for making a choice they wouldn't make. And it's extra nasty because you didn't make that choice freely.\n\nedit: my family (almost) never visits because I live in a town 15 km (9.3 miles) away, and it's a 25 minute drive (or longer depending on the traffic) from their place to mine. I'm LC  with my family and at peace with it now.", "NTA"]}
