Quite the opposite.", "She knows my family aren't overly keen on my stepdad. He's not a particularly nasty person but he just doesn't include himself in the family unless he absolutely has to. My gran would have went berserk if she knew my mum had let him kick me out and done nothing about it", "Thank you, I do have a very good friend through here but we both work and are both at university full time so we don't get to see each other that often. I've joined a hiking group on Facebook so hopefully once the weather gets better I'll be able to start socialising through that :)", "I wouldn't say never, sometimes you just need to hold your tongue.  Like you shouldn't tell someone they have giant ears/nose even if they do, or tell them that their newborn is ugly AF even if the precious little one is.", "If I don't drive to go see them then I wouldn't see them. I can understand my gran, she doesn't drive and my grandad was diagnosed with dementia recently but as a family we made the decision to take his car away a couple of years ago as we were pretty sure then that he had dementia and his driving was becoming more erratic and dangerous. So I'm more than happy to drive and visit my gran, I'm just expected to visit everyone while I'm through because my mum won't drive for an hour to come and see me. I've lived in my flat for 5 years and my mums been here twice ( neither time she drove)", "I can understand my mum not wanting it brought up, but my gran knows what my stepdads like and what he's been like ever since my mum met him so she wasn't surprised when the truth came out. She's just more upset that my mum basically chose him over me", "She just went along with it. I think that's why my gran is so mad cos she never even stood up for me at the time", "I didn't. Basically both sets of parents hate each other and have done ever since my mum and dad split (I was about 4 or 5 at the time) even though they have both moved on and have remarried me and my brother have been constantly used as pawns in this war between them. When I was 21 I found out my fiance had stolen all the money from our joint savings account that was supposed to pay for our wedding, shortly after I lost my job so my dad told me I was welcome to come stay with him and clear my head for a bit. My stepdad took the huff and told me if I left I wasn't welcome to come home but I thought he was bluffing so I stayed with my dad for a couple of weeks and then came home to find all my belongings in black bags on my mums doorstep :/", "Not a particularly nasty person but still kicked you out your home at 21! Gran had his number and was obviously annoyed that your mum had kept this from her.", "Another applicable platitude: The threefold \"should I say it\" test.\n\n1. Is it true?\n2. Is it necessary?\n3. Is it kind?", "That is not an issue with what you're saying (the truth), it's an issue with how you're saying it (your delivery).\n\n\"If you can't figure out how to be kind, figure out how to be silent.\"", "So, your mom is an AH. I am sorry for you. You always hope that parents act like, well parents. \n\nI totally get your grandparents. The rest of your family though. I am really sorry you don't have better family. I would not be surprised that their behavior comes from your mother lies. However, family should never expect one sided effort. They may not like the situation, they can all help overcome it.\n\nI hope it will come better for you, now the truth is out.", "This stinks because I feel like you have to choose sides. I hope things get better", "Oh FUCK that dude", "Right, that's what I'm saying.  It's possible to say the truth and still be wrong for it.  I was commenting on how they said you're NEVER the AH for telling the truth.  If it's unnecessary to say and it's not kind to say it, you're still an AH if you say it even if it's true.\n\nLike when I was 7 or 8 and a really pudgy kid, I walked into a room and my grandmother says to me \"that's the way fat men wear their pants\".  She wasn't lying, but she was an AH for saying it.  She got so pissed about my reply of \"that's the way grandmas lose their teeth\".  Fun times.", "Honestly, when it comes to family there is such a rabbit Warren of events that when i sit and think about it all I just want to cut off contact with both sets of parents. However I don't believe they are bad people and I can't imagine not having my mum and dad in my life no matter how they treat me", "The weird thing is, I don't have a bad relationship with my stepdad. We are perfectly civil to each other and I'm always made to feel welcome at their home. It's just whenever my dad is involved in anything that tempers flare up.", "My ex or my stepdad? :L", "Now see, I\u2019m the type that would\u2019ve laughed that off with an admission that I\u2019d just been charred to a crisp.", ">It's possible to say the truth and still be wrong for it.\n\nThis is probably a semantic thing. Because my point is you wouldn't be wrong \"because you told the truth,\" you'd be wrong *because you said something unnecessary* or *because you said something unkind*.\n\nThose two possible reasons aren't \"because you told the truth.\"\n\nYou're sliding the actual cause of *why* you're wrong onto another facet of the situation that occurred simultaneously. This is a common thing in language, you're not alone in doing it, but I believe in specificity.\n\n**Edit to add:** What you're doing is kind of like reverse gaslighting. If some jerk had said \"all I'm doing is telling the truth\" when they were being cruel and unnecessary, your *actual* issue is that they were being cruel and unnecessary, and they're trying to gaslight one thing over to another and pretend that you have no reason to be mad at them because what they said is true. They lie when they say that's \"all\" they're doing.\n\n**Edit again to add:** You may be treating the statement \"because you told the truth\" as an *indirect* cause; because they told the truth, it allowed them the opportunity to be unkind, and thus the direct cause: because they were unkind, they were in the wrong. And your argument could be \"if they had never told the truth then the opportunity to be unkind would not have existed.\"\n\nBut it is this separation between *direct* and *indirect* causes that I want to be super specific about because indirect causes happen all the time and we shouldn't ever actually lay the blame on those because that can get messy *real* quick. Identifying the true and actual cause is a much more precise way to resolve and heal things.", "I get that. I am still in contact with my family as well. Even though things happened that would be a very good reason to cut certain members completely out. \n\nDoesn't mean you don't deserve better.", "Yes", "Both! I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been through that.", "I would do the same now, but there was no way I was laughing that off as a young kid suffering through my own shame about my body.", "Thank you. That isn't even a scraping of what I've been through but it's the first time my mum has proven to me that she will pick my stepdad over her own kids"]}
