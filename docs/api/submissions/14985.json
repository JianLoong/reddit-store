We have three children (20F, 17F, 11M). We've both worked hard to get where we are in our careers, and thankfully that means we're able to provide a good life for our kids. We aren't rich, and we don't live beyond our means, but combined we make about 300K per year.\n\nNow here's the thing, if we went the traditional route and saved heavily and worked another 25 years, we could probably retire at a decent age and still leave a sizable inheritance for our kids. The thing is that we don't want that for us or them. We worked hard to get where we are, and we intend to enjoy the rewards of that before we're elderly. We also don't want our kids to be counting down the days until we die so they can get our money and never work again.\n\nSo our plan is to retire about the time our son graduates high school. We'll have enough saved up to live comfortably and travel more, and we intend to use all our money. We have a rainy day fund of course, but we fully plan to use as much of our money as possible. They'll get a portion of what we have left once both of us die, but they shouldn't expect anything.\n\nWe've never really brought this up with any of the kids. For one it's our money and our business, and for another they never asked. We did however explain that we aren't giving them handouts as adults. We pay half of whatever their school ends up costing, and that'll be the last major money we ever give them.\n\nI recently had a minor health scare (Precancerous mole, I'm fine) and the topic came up with our oldest about what our plans were. I explained the money situation. This really upset her, she accused us of caring more about partying than her and her siblings wellbeing. I explained that we'd rather them make their own way in life like we did, not wait for a handout.\n\nShe told her sister, and now they're both upset with my wife and I, not just for the inheritance, but for not telling them sooner. I don't think there was any good reason to do that, it isn't their business what happens to other people's money. Still I'm open to being wrong about that.", "created_utc": 1681685593, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12os992/aita_for_never_telling_our_children_that_they/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's absolutely your money. Do whatever you wish with it. Your kids are definitely not entitled to an inheritance. What makes this ESH for me is you only paying half of their education when you can absolutely pay for the whole thing. I never had any help and my opportunities for education were limited because of that. Why would you want them to start off life so heavily on debt when you don't have to? I'm a firm believer in paying for your children's post secondary if you're able and if you're thinking of retiring when you're last graduates high school then you're absolutely able to pay.", "You don't owe your kids anything.

By telling your kids that you're planning on spending all the money you have so nothing will be left for them, you're taking away one of the hopes they have that they'll be able to retire someday themselves.  I don't know how you broke the news to them, but it might have come across coldly, that in a few years you're washing your hands of them and running off to live happily ever after.\n\nYou should look into getting something like a life insurance policy with them as the beneficiaries so you can provide a financial cushion for your kids when you die without having to work a few more decades to provide a big inheritance.  Your kids will feel like you're looking out for them without major hardship on your part.", "NTA assuming you are pre-paying for all of your memorial and funeral expenses and have a plan for your life when you become in need of assistance or care. Now if you plan for your kids to pay for memorials and such and plan for them to care for you in your elderly years then that is a problem. If they are not your financial problem then you are not their financial problem and they don't owe you care or expenses. \n\nAlso at 300k a year you should be paying for college expenses. They don't qualify for aid based on your income until they are over 24. Scholarships heavily favor financial need as well. Half in this economy and with inflation pretty much ensures they will not get a college education and potentially not even a trade school education.

Or did you graduate with zero debt during a time when minimum wage could support a middle class life? If so, then you\u2019re definitely leaving your kids in a really shitty position because they\u2019ll graduate with debt and end up paying almost twice what they originally borrowed because of interest. \n\nIt just depends on what kind of life you\u2019re looking to leave your kids. You\u2019re not an asshole for enjoying your retirement and wanting to spend all the money on yourself, but I think you\u2019re just a shitty dad for not caring about their future.

It doesn\u2019t seem like you think very highly of your children\u2019s character.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off, lol at not thinking you're rich when you earn 300k a year. If you're not rich, how could your kids possibly expect to inherit and never have to work again? Second of all, you do realize there's a happy medium between cutting your kids off and spoiling them rotten, right? You can be supportive parents and also teach them the value of work. Third, life isn't the same now as it was when you started out. Housing and education in particular have gotten way more expensive in the last 20 years. If you can at least help them get their degrees without  them being saddled with a bunch of debt, you absolutely should. No one's saying you have to buy them each a house or pay for extravagant weddings, but you sound like incredibly harsh parents who are all too happy to pull the ladder up behind yourselves in life.", "You definitely should have talked to them about it. That was my parents view they made it clear I would probably not get much inheritance except the house but that I would also never need to take care of them financially. I was just fine with that.\n\nOf course then my dad gambled away all that savings AND the house and I ended up taking care of my mom financially until she decided homophobically bite the gay hand that was feeding her\u2026 so it didn't quite work out. But the fact that I was never expecting money even in the best case scenario helped ease the pain.", "NTA. No one should assume they\u2019re going to inherit anything. Stuff happens. Nursing home memory care starts at something like $6000/month. Your kids are too young to be anticipating your deaths and what they will be getting out of it.", "ESH, but mostly you. Nobody is entitled to inheritance,  but there's a difference between giving handouts to adults and doing your job as a parent. I couldn't imagine making 300k and not paying for my kids' education, leaving them saddled with loans for years. You chose to have children, they did not choose to be born. If you wanted a childfree life, with early retirement and no responsibilities towards others you should have had that. \n\nYour children bringing up inheritance (especially at such a young age - seriously, that's not what normal teens and 21 year olds think about) shows how you've raised them.

And people shouldn't make a life plan about an inheritance.

I mean, it's your child, to be the duty as parents is to make a nice living, build a nice life for the kids and give them as much help as possible so they can hav a nice life too, and so on. I don't say that to insult you or your wife, but i found both of you quite selfish even if i understand and agree with your logic. It's your kids, and if you act selfih like that, and dropped them once they all done with highschool because you want to party with your wife, be prepared to end alone and don't count on them too much when you will be older and in need.", "Nah but why did you have kids if you don\u2019t intend to leave them in a better situation than you grew up in?

To leave a future generation in a better place than you lived?\n\nLike, yeah, it\u2019s your money, and you don\u2019t OWE your kids anything, but why have kids if you just intend to leave them to relive your lives of struggle and hardship? Especially if you\u2019re only paying half of their education expenses?

Though in our case their will be assets, at least the house, which is paid.", "NTA - an inheritance should NEVER be someone\u2019s life plan. This is YOUR money to spend as you please. When you pass, an inheritance can be a blessing, sure - but it\u2019s a bonus, not a given. \n\nYour kids are way too young to be salivating over the thought of scoring moolah after your demises- try and speak with them again to work out where this entitlement is coming from.\n\nETA- story time.

His kids were in their 60s - and they barely saw their dad or had an interest in his life but as soon as he remarried, they lost their minds. \n\nThey took their dad to court, demanding their inheritance while he was still alive, accused my Nan of being a gold digger (when she had a similar financial situation and didn\u2019t need his money).

The lawyers. My nana and her husband were put through huge amounts of stress and legal battles because his kids felt that they were owed a pay day more than an old man and his wife were owed their ability to travel and enjoy themselves in their later years. \n\nSo yes - I\u2019m biased when it comes to this topic.

We aren't rich, and we don't live beyond our means, but combined we make about 300K per year.\n\nNow here's the thing, if we went the traditional route and saved heavily and worked another 25 years, we could probably retire at a decent age and still leave a sizable inheritance for our kids. The thing is that we don't want that for us or them. We worked hard to get where we are, and we intend to enjoy the rewards of that before we're elderly. We also don't want our kids to be counting down the days until we die so they can get our money and never work again.\n\nSo our plan is to retire about the time our son graduates high school. We'll have enough saved up to live comfortably and travel more, and we intend to use all our money. We have a rainy day fund of course, but we fully plan to use as much of our money as possible. They'll get a portion of what we have left once both of us die, but they shouldn't expect anything.\n\nWe've never really brought this up with any of the kids. For one it's our money and our business, and for another they never asked. We did however explain that we aren't giving them handouts as adults. We pay half of whatever their school ends up costing, and that'll be the last major money we ever give them.\n\nI recently had a minor health scare (Precancerous mole, I'm fine) and the topic came up with our oldest about what our plans were. I explained the money situation. This really upset her, she accused us of caring more about partying than her and her siblings wellbeing.

Maybe that\u2019s why I feel so strongly about this - it makes me sad to see how poorly he seems to think of his children and that they would somehow wish for their parents\u2019 death just for the sake of money. I know a number of people who have received substantial inheritances and just about every one of them would give it back in a heartbeat to have more time with their parents. \n\nAnyway thanks and likewise to you :)", "FYI man you super come off as a condescending asshole", "Non op literally said he wants them to struggle. Whatever op can leave nothing but if I\u2019m those kids I\u2019m not going to have a relationship with them.", "How old are you planning for your children to be when you die? OPs children will likely be in their 60s."]}
