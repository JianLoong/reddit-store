I just wanted to let you all know that I did ask her therapist about medications and the therapist doesn't believe in giving medications. She told me that she thinks that my daughter can heal without them. That's why I don't understand why she wants to pursue a diagnosis.\n\nEdit 2: I know it was a long time ago but when my mother sent me to a therapist she told me it should only have taken four months, so guess what I did? Got myself situated after four months. Now I'm a happy adult. Sometimes it's your job as a parent to guide your child.\n\nHello there. I am the mother of a 15 year old daughter. I noticed that my daughter cries a lot but won't tell me why. She promised me that nothing bad has happened to her, she just feels overwhelmed. I think it's because she doesn't spend enough time with her friends.\n\nMy husband told me to put her in therapy. We also put my son, 10 years old, in therapy too. My son's therapist told me that he's doing well and has learned all the skills he needs, so we've ended his appointments. My daughter's therapist told me that she wants to diagnose her with an anxiety disorder.\n\nI don't think that my daughter has an anxiety disorder. She's been a happy child for most of her life, and she herself says that nothing bad's happening to her, she just feels overwhelmed. I think she's gotten more anxious since she's started seeing this therapist. She's also gotten more withdrawn and spends more time on the computer.\n\nI decided that we weren't seeing improvement so last week I told my daughter we would be ending her appointments with that therapist and switching to a new one. My daughter started crying and told me that she really liked and trusted that therapist. However, neither my husband nor I have seen improvement in the five months she's been in therapy. I said I would consider sending her to a different doctor, but my daughter says she doesn't want to start all over. She said I'm cruel and the reason why she has an anxiety disorder. Like I said before, I don't think she has an anxiety disorder, but I don't want to be cruel to her.

Why do you think that how you and you husband feel trumps what your daughter is saying about *her* mental health and *her* comfort with someone else.\n\nAs someone with several anxiety disorders, you absolutely have no idea what you're talking about. Anxiety doesn't look the same to everyone, and a lot of times, it isn't noticeable to others, so stop saying you \"don't think she has an anxiety disorder\". Shut up. I've had many, many panic attacks right in front of people, but I don't say anything, so people don't know that I'm in the middle of one. Her crying a lot, being overwhelmed, and looking for distractions like computer time *IS* a symptom of anxiety disorders.\n\nStop fucking telling your daughter how *she* feels. You aren't her. Also, you don't just get over anxiety disorders. I've had them my whole life. Therapists just help teach better coping mechanisms as well as ways to navigate around anxiety/anxiety attacks.\n\nHow about actually listen to your damn daughter instead of telling her how you think she feels and what you do and don't think she has. You aren't a goddamn doctor. Stop fucking talking over your kid, and **STOP** putting a timeline on her improvement.\n\nHoly shit, I'm so tired of parents walking all over their children and telling them what mental health issues they do and don't have. I've had depression almost my whole damn life, and when I told my mother I thought I had it around the age of 11, she told me \"no, I don't think you do. Everyone gets sad\". So, I was left to deal with it alone for years, become suicidal at 16, and not get diagnosed or any help until I was 19. Stop it.", "You are cruel, uneducated and unreasonable. -- YTA\n\nYou ignore a licensed medical professional's assessment re: an anxiety disorders. You did not consider your daughter's symptoms did not increase (ie hospitalization) while in therapy. Stopping therapy and not supporting your daughter has consequences. Untreated anxiety leads to degeneration of the hippocampus and PFC---her brain is at risk.  She is asking you to stay with the current counselor. The greatest value in mental health progress is the relationship between the client and provider...why are you risking this?  She will be 18 in less than 3 years. You have a very short window to support her to her highest possible health level. C'mon, don't blow it.", "YTA. Are you a licensed therapist? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.  The therapist believes she has anxiety and your daughter has expressed that she doesn\u2019t want to change therapists. Do you even understand how fortunate it is your daughter has someone she\u2019s comfortable with right off the bat? Many of us have to try multiple times before finding the right fit. Stop being oblivious", "YTA. This is a blatant show of disrespect to your child. She told you she feels comfortable with this therapist. Perhaps it\u2019s doing something for her that you cannot see. Your daughter attending therapy isn\u2019t supposed to show results for YOU. It\u2019s for HER. If you end these appointments, it will be very damaging for both your daughter and her relationship with you.", "YTA, just because you can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d her anxiety doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s there. Anxiety most often is a hidden illness. Is it at all possible that you are the source of your daughters anxiety and can\u2019t fathom that idea? Many people can develop general anxiety disorder without having anything clearly \u201cbad\u201d happen to them. My parents used to think the same of me growing up and it severely damaged my relationship with them as they couldn\u2019t believe I had anxiety and that they didn\u2019t notice", ">I don't think that my daughter has an anxiety disorder.

I can tell you as someone who has anxiety issues, you're gonna mess her up, and badly. Anxiety tends to get worse before it gets better. If she's not on meds, she's learning new ways to cope. That will take trial and error. You can have anxiety and still be happy, so your reasoning makes no sense. Google is free. Give your daughter back the help she needs.", "YTA.

Are you a qualified professional to diagnose whether or not someone has an anxiety disorder? I'm gonna assume no. Anxiety disorders have nothing to do with being \"happy\" or having \"something bad happen,\" and being \"overwhelmed\" is a symptom of anxiety. You're beyond cruel, and you'll be lucky if she speaks to you as an adult if you pull her out of therapy after she says it's helping. YTA.", "YTA. She\u2019s right - you are the reason for the anxiety and depression. \n\nI struggle with anxiety and depression and have for as long as I can remember. Getting sound help for it now (in my 40\u2019s) and wonder what my life would have been like had I got the proper therapy and medical attention as a child. You have that opportunity for your child and you\u2019re flushing it away. \n\nMental health is as important as physical health. You take her to appointments, right? Wellness, gyno, dental? This is an important appointment to keep and the more we can dial into that need, the better it is for our collective future.\n\nMy kiddo was in therapy for a while. They are a completely different child. They needed an outlet and a safe space to communicate that, evidently, I couldn\u2019t provide at the time. The support we gave them helped shape who they are today - someone who is resilient and capable of coping with the weight of the today\u2019s world. I hope they continue on this path. \n\nI hope you listen to your kid with an open heart and mind.", "YTA - dear lord, I am worried for your daughter. You are not a licensed therapist and are not equipped to diagnose your daughter or anyone else. Your daughter doesn't need to have gone through trauma (ex: \"nothing happened\") in order to feel anxious or overwhelmed. It's also difficult for kids (and adults) to know how to articulate their feelings and this is often learned in therapy. What do you think \"overwhelmed\" means? You think she's happy and relaxed but \"overwhelmed\"? Overwhelmed can lead to  depression and suicial thoughts or worse. Therapy can take years of processing and hard work and often is needed for chronic conditions like anxiety. You do not know what is best for your daughter in this situation and appear to be comparing her progress to her brother. Yes, you would be cruel to sever the relationship with a therapist that your daughter trusts.

Nothing to discuss further. YTA.", "YTA If your daughter has good rapport with the therapist and feels a benefit, it\u2019s cruel to take that away. Why don\u2019t you set up an appointment with the therapist to discuss your concerns? There are rules about what she can reveal about your daughter, but maybe she can address your worries. Talking with you might also give her a more complete picture of your daughter. You can also look into meeting with a psychiatrist for formal testing. If your daughter does have anxiety and needs medication, the therapist won\u2019t be able to prescribe. Lots of kids have a therapist and psychiatrist. Also, being overwhelmed is a sign of anxiety.", "L O L. Yes, YTA. \n\nI distinctly recall sitting in the emergency room when my mom first found out I had been self harming religiously at 13, for over a year. She sobbed to me, \"You were always so happy and outgoing!\". Uh, yeah. Because I was conditioned that that was the only way I was allowed to present myself.

Good, that's what a good parent does. Now you've been told your daughter has anxiety, but have decided that the *professional* whom your daughter trusts and says helps her is wrong? Why do you think you know better, just because you're her mom? You couldn't figure it out before, so why do you suddenly think you know everything now?\n\nYTA. Pulling her out of therapy now will most likely damage your relationship with her, **permanently**. Therapy isn't some instant \"fix\" that will somehow revert them to how you remember them a few years ago, it's a long process that requires patience, understanding, and trust.", "YTA. If you yank her out and force her to start over with a new therapist, you\u2019ll not only set her progress back (and yes, she has made progress even if you don\u2019t see it as such) you will also destroy her trust in you at least somewhat. Therapy can take years. Just because she isn\u2019t magically better in a couple months you think it isn\u2019t working? Therapy can seem to make things worse, yes, but that is very often part of the process! Every patient is different. If she\u2019s established a rapport with her therapist that\u2019s a good thing! It means her treatment will go smoother\u2014 if you allow her to continue and good God\u2014 have patience with her! \n\nYou are actively making things worse by pressuring her to show improvement on *your* schedule, for *your* convenience, instead of thinking about what is best for *her!*", "As a mother whose daughter was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder around your child\u2019s age, I can confidently say YTA. Happy people can suffer from anxiety disorders.  Furthermore, one doesn\u2019t have to specifically have something bad to happen to them to have an anxiety disorder. Your attitude and dismissal of how she feels is what is contributing to it. If you allow a formal diagnosis, your therapist can come up with a treatment plan appropriate for your daughter.\n\nMy daughter appeared happy yet she was slowly dying inside. She almost 24 now and still sees her therapist and her psychiatrist is excelling in all areas of her life (including grad school). Putting her in therapy her diagnosed was the best thing we ever did.

This ended up being one of their biggest regrets because the problems only grew because I had no one to tell me how to manage my thoughts and day to day life. \nI ended up secretly going to therapy and because of this (and other reasons) I am LC with my parents. \n\nPlease let your daughter decide what is good for her. She\u2019s old enough to know what helps her and what doesn\u2019t. Talk to her and tell her that even though you might not understand, you will try to do so and be there for her every step of the way.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that it\u2019s pretty rare to find a therapist that you can trust and have a genuine connection with. There are a lot of qualified therapists out there, but you need to be compatible on an emotional level as well. Your daughter seems to have found one: please let her keep it.", "YTA. I had parents with a similar mindset to yours. They're not allowed to be part of my life very often now that I'm an adult. Your daughter knows herself. Believe her. If you continue you claim you know her better than she knows herself, you very well might lose the privilege of knowing her. Letting her stay with a therapist she feels safe with is something that does you absolutely no harm. But removing her from that therapist can cause her unneeded distress. \n\nIf you disregard her wishes around treating her mental health, you're telling her that you don't see her as trustworthy, and that you don't see her as a person. \n\nObviously a 15 year old needs guidance. I'm not saying turn her out to make terrible decisions completely on her own. But this? Is not a bad decision.

Oftentimes things get worse before they get better. If you want your child to get better, LISTEN to her.

You clearly don't have an understanding of mental health issues, which is why you need the therapist for your daughter. A few things to address...\n\nMental health issues often first appear during the teenage years. Many people who suffer from mental health issues had happy, normal childhoods. So you can't disregard the possibility of current issues just because you don't believe she had issues in the past.\n\nEvery person is unique, and responds to therapy in different ways. It is an AH move to compare her to her brother. Comparing one person's mental health to another's is only going to INCREASE their anxiety.\n\nYou don't see progress - yet you also missed the anxiety entirely. How do you know there isn't progress in something you aren't even capable of seeing? If she and her therapist are seeing progress, then that's what matters.\n\nTreatment isn't linear. It's not like you're this bad on day 1, day 2 you're a little better, day 3 a little better. There are ups and downs, there are setbacks, there may be a decline before improvement starts. People often require therapy for years, even a lifetime. That doesn't mean therapy isn't working - they may very well be better with the therapy than they would have been without it.\n\nIf you decide you want to stop treatment, you need to have a discussion with both your daughter and her therapist BEFORE terminating the sessions. They need to both have a say in what the ultimate decision is. You are ending a relationship between two people that doesn't involve you at all. A sudden end to a relationship of trust is going to IMMENSELY increase you're daughter's anxiety, and create a lot of resentment towards you.", "YTA. My mother was like you.

That pathology is why your daughter is taking longer than your son to see imporvements. \n\nThe point of a diagnosis is to 1. Legitimise the client's symptoms in their own eyes and the eyes of others 2. Make the course for treatment clearer and 3. Have it on paper for if/when accommodations need to be made.

Everything is significantly more challenging and takes a lot more time. A lot of the time you spend in therapy, you take one step forward and are pulled two steps back by something else.

There is a significant difference, and rarely do psychiatrists see clients in therapeutic contexts, e.g., weekly, and if they do, I trust that OP is smart enough to utilize the correct terminology.

I am the mother of a 15 year old daughter. I noticed that my daughter cries a lot but won't tell me why. She promised me that nothing bad has happened to her, she just feels overwhelmed. I think it's because she doesn't spend enough time with her friends. \n\nMy husband told me to put her in therapy. We also put my son, 10 years old, in therapy too. My son's therapist told me that he's doing well and has learned all the skills he needs, so we've ended his appointments. My daughter's therapist told me that she wants to diagnose her with an anxiety disorder. \n\nI don't think that my daughter has an anxiety disorder. She's been a happy child for most of her life, and she herself says that nothing bad's happening to her, she just feels overwhelmed. I think she's gotten more anxious since she's started seeing this therapist. She's also gotten more withdrawn and spends more time on the computer. \n\nI decided that we weren't seeing improvement so last week I told my daughter we would be ending her appointments with that therapist and switching to a new one. My daughter started crying and told me that she really liked and trusted that therapist. However, neither my husband nor I have seen improvement in the five months she's been in therapy. I said I would consider sending her to a different doctor, but my daughter says she doesn't want to start all over. She said I'm cruel and the reason why she has an anxiety disorder. Like I said before, I don't think she has an anxiety disorder, but I don't want to be cruel to her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, it may be required by law or by insurance (if it's not private pay) for the therapist to put down some kind of diagnosis and they were being ethical in keeping you informed about their impressions. Secondly, even if you did want to pursue medications, that would mostly likely require your daughter to officially be diagnosed.\n\nLastly, the therapeutic process takes time and is unique to every individual. You saying she's made no progress could be extremely hurtful to your daughter who probably feels like she's actually made progress. Much therapeutic progress is internal first and takes time to show itself through external changes. This is especially so with adults and teens vs children. You should not be comparing each of your children's therapy journeys. The therapeutic relationship is the largest factor for change in therapy.

Anxiety can develop for all sorts of reasons . IVE got generalized Anxiety and you can't out logic it. You can be happy one minutethen the Anxiety monster appears.  However if you daughter felt unsafe expressing her emotions to a mom who minimalizes her feelings guarantee she was \"Masking\" for you so you didn't notice.\n\nYour daughter trusts the therapist and wants to work with them? Great. Let her.  Don't end the sessions because she's not \"improving\"enough to fit your idea of who your daughter is..", "This. YTA OP\n\nYou may want the best for your children but telling them how they feel is going to do more harm than good. Let her keep this therapist and give her time.\n\nWhat a dick move, honestly.", "This is spot on. My Mom didn\u2019t believe something was wrong with me either. I was suicidal through high school. I slept through classes because my anxiety and insomnia were so bad. I finally just dropped out of school and moved out as soon as I could. As an adult I was eventually diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder and was able to put my life back together, get my ged, and start college.  OP you remind me of my mom and 100% YTA. Listen to your daughter and stop pretending you have the ability to decide how she feels.", "I would argue that \u201cfeeling overwhelmed all the time but nothing bad is going on\u201d is actually a really good description of an anxiety disorder, especially from a teenager who doesn\u2019t have more sophisticated terms or descriptions available to her.", "Also diagnosed with anxiety disorder around this age. After a few months of therapy, I was getting better and my parents thought I was \u201cfixed.\u201d Stopped my therapy sessions. \n\nBut then I just white knuckled it through life until I had a full blown breakdown in college.\n\nBring your daughter back to her therapist, she needs it.\n\nYTA", "\u2018Your daughter has a broken leg\u2019\n\n\u2018No she doesn\u2019t, her leg has worked all her life! It\u2019s just that recently she damaged it and can\u2019t use it anymore!\u2019 \n\nThat\u2019s what Op sounds like lol", "Probably why the daughter doesn't talk to OP about whats going on too", "This right here, confronting my anxiety has meant that I needed to put myself in situations that made me anxious to try the tools recommended in therapy, and when they didn\u2019t work immediately, it sucked, but that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to keep practicing and it\u2019ll get better over time, the therapist seeking a diagnosis for OP\u2019s daughter could also ensure she gets better help for her condition, and that certain accomodation be made at school or wherever she ends up working to help her manage her anxiety better", "OP is definitely YTA. I have moderate to severe anxiety (along with other issues) and I\u2019ve been in therapy for almost two years and haven\u2019t been anywhere near \u201ccured,\u201d but I sure as shit know when I haven\u2019t seen my therapist in too long (usually if it\u2019s been over a week I\u2019m starting to have mental health issues). Therapy takes major time and if OP\u2019s daughter trusts that therapist, OP is absolutely going to make things worse by pulling her out of therapy.", "This so needs to be higher.\n\nYTA - because mental health can take a long time to unravel and your embarrassment or fear about stigma can halt your daughter's progress.\n\nArrange to meet with the therapist and ask them some questions:  \n\n\n1. What is the basis for the diagnosis of anxiety?\n2. What can you do as a parent to best help your daughter?\n3. Are there tests or measure that can be done to confirm the diagnosis (or refute)?\n\nI'm sure there are many others.   But you are drawing a conclusion based on a lack of evidence, and a lack of knowledge - as well as disrupting your daughters healing.  You are supposed to be part of the healing process for her.  This isn't like going to a surgeon where they remove your infected appendix and you are good to go after recovery.  Mental health shifts and changes in rhythm to our inner world, and moves to the tempo of our inner mind.  \n\nWhat you can do, and I hope you will:  ask the therapist, and your daughter, what you can do to better help support her healing.  Be open to what you hear.  Do what you reasonably can, check back often.", "Agree! Systemic therapy would be really helpful here!", "Remember to put the YTA so the vote counts.\n\nAnd I couldn't agree more.", "Not to mention that now the daughter will wonder if its even worth it, since if OP doesnt hear something she agrees with, she will just end the appointments. I am a therapist myself and I saw this happen so many times. The biggest challenge in working with children and teens are always the helicopter parents. OP, YTA.", "If she\u2019s created a rapport with this therapist and you take that away from her, what reason would she have for trying to build a rapport with the next one knowing that you\u2019ll just yank that one away if you don\u2019t see \u201cprogress\u201d? YTA if you do this to her.", "We\u2019re going to see OP\u2019s daughter in r/raisedbynarcissists someday.", "And completely skips over daughter saying you are cruel, that's why I'm anxious YTA", "Then go read Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. Read up on Emotionally Negligent Mothers.\n\nIt will really have you kicking yourself. You will recognize what you didn't receive. And what you are now withholding from your own child.\n\nBecome aware.", "And these things if left untreated could lead to her withdrawing more till essentially she\u2019s a stranger to her own family. If she acts out OP will be to blame", "Ooo this. If OP wants to have any kind of relationship with her daughter after the next 3 years, she's gonna have some WORK to do. \n\nSorry you dealt with that, I hope you're doing well now :)", "OP is afraid that the professionals point out that they are the main reason the daughter has her issues...", "Yes she's not even listening to her daughter! A licensed therapist said that she has a disorder but her mom doesn't believe it! That's just ridiculous! So switch to a different doctor so she can get the same diagnosis maybe then she would believe it.", "I'm grown and my mom still tells me to do that. Sigh", "I agree OP is TA, but for the record I recently had an infection and when I didn\u2019t see improvements after a day and a half on the antibiotic, my doctor told me to go back to the hospital. So not a valid comparison, because you should be seeing some improvements after 2 days on antibiotics", "Yeah I've been in therapy since April and we still have so much to work through. It's helped tremendously but it's only an hour once a week, the therapist isn't going to magically cure her overnight, possibly not at all - some mental health issues just never go away and all we can do is learn to manage it the best we can. I feel so bad for OP's daughter, she deserves better.", "You forgot the part where you call her the asshole. Cause she\u2019s DEFINITELY the asshole here.", "I was looking for this comment. It\u2019s usually estimated that going to therapy once a week~, leads to a tough time the first six months, to a year. Why? Because you start to unpack a lot of the stuff that you didn\u2019t necessarily actually deal with before, because you didn\u2019t have the proper tools or space.\nA lot of people end up intellectualizing their feelings, instead of working on those feelings (I do this myself a lot), so while you may understand yourself better, that doesn\u2019t mean that you actually dealt with those feelings.", "Well OP keeps getting told BY daughter that daughter feels overwhelmed to the point of crying all the time... But OP doesn't believe that's anxiety...  Sooooo yeah OP doesn't have a missing reason, OP doesn't listen.", "Exactly what I thought! As soon as I finished reading this, I thought that maybe OP not listening to her daughter is nothing new and that\u2019s exactly why something like an anxiety disorder has developed. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case of course her daughter wouldn\u2019t open up about how she\u2019s truly feeling to her mother and that poor daughter will probably never have trust in her mother. She finally had a therapist to reach out to and her mothers trying to rip that away\ud83e\udd22", "THIS 1000%!!!!!\n\nMedicine helps, sure, but it's not a solve-all magic pill. Even with medication you can still have panic attacks or similar. Therapy helps SO MUCH to get tools that help you handle it.\n\nI'm glad someone mentioned this", "Exactly! It's not just a switch! Mental illness is always there, no matter what we present on the surface", "This. All of this.\n\nYTA, OP", "Agreed, also I'd like to add that at the beginning of therapy, they might seem \"not improving\" or even \"worse\", but the reason is not necessarily that the therapy is not working. Rather, the girl and the therapist are unraveling stuff (trauma) that might have been safely hidden away and suppressed, and touching that can shake you up - but it's absolutely necessary to go there for the therapy to be successful.", "this is a great response, i 100% agree.", "What do you mean 'Both of your children are under 15 and have been in therapy?' That doesn't mean I've traumatised them. It means I support them enough to pay for them to get help. Isn't it good to send your children to therapy?", "This is your answer OP. You will be TA if you push in any other direction.", "Nope, OP should keep her *in* therapy and listen to her. She clearly does have an anxiety disorder and OP just refuses to accept it.", "That's the part that gets me. OP seems to be delusional, trying to maintain a reality she prefers, even if that means not giving a damn about the feelings of her own child. I could imagine that it's not great when the therapy opens the floodgate and conflicts break out that were there all the time, but not visible. But how cold to just outright deny that your daughter may have feelings that OP doesn't want her to have?", "While I 100% agree with what you\u2019ve said here OP\u2019s comments make me doubt OP\u2019s reporting/motives. \n\nFor instance one of her reasons for changing therapists is that OP had back surgery and she recovered more quickly from the back surgery than her daughter has from her anxiety. Not a valid comparison at all. \n\nIt is very very important for professionals to draw clear boundaries in terms of what is within their scope. Overstepping those boundaries is dangerous and unethical. \n\nI still think you are correct *and* that OP is the AH.", "Yeah the edit changes a lot, but OP is still an asshole for delegitimizing her daughters experiences and wishes.", "Completely agree.  I still think OP is YTA for wanting to break off the relationship, but they should consult a psychiatrist who is qualified to decide whether medication is appropriate in addition to the therapist. And as to to poster who said taking meds would get in the way of the work that she needs to do, that\u2019s not necessarily so. Meds may be able to reduce her anxiety to a level where she is able to work on the root causes of her anxiety and strategies for coping with it far more effectively.", "The non-medicated approach can work, but it simply takes longer. Which makes sense that the OP hasn't seen much change or improvement yet. I stress the word yet. I'm also taking a non-medicated approach and I've been in therapy for 2 years. I do have a lot of past trauma that I am trying to unpack, but this IS working for me and I appreciate not having to be medicated to have progress. The OP'S daughter could be on the  cusp of change and all of the current progress will be lost.", "But the daughter wouldn\u2019t be getting medication from the therapist anyways.  She can continue to see this therapist and also see a psychiatrist to review medication options.", "This won't be the popular answer, but I think it's right.  Parents have to do the hard things in life and this sounds like it's one of the hardest.  Lots of hugs to OP's daughter, the last several years have been really hard on everyone, esp the kids.", "Yeah, the lack of love for her daughter in this post is upsetting. A loving parent would want to listen to what her daughter thinks helps her and learn about what she might have, not shut the door the moment she sees a diagnosis she doesn't like.", "Yes! Possibly she doesn\u2019t know the proper way to express her anxious thoughts, especially to her (seemingly controlling) mother. I used to also feel like I couldn\u2019t have anxiety because nothing bad had happened to me and it just made everything worse", "Exactly - if someone is overwhelmed to the point of tears as a regular occurrence they're probably coping with anxiety.", "I LOVE Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents-OP I highly recommend you read this as well.  \n\nActually read that one first and THEN read Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child.", "Not to mention that she will not trust the new therapist  either due to simple resentment from losing the first one. You can't just transfer that trust, which is very hard to gain. And what when it gets worse? New therapist? Poor girl...", "Yes it is good. It\u2019s also good to allow them to fully go through the process. There is no magic button to speed things along. Your kid told you they want to keep going. Stop interfering and giving your baseless opinions.", "It is good to send them to therapy but it\u2019s terrible parenting to pull your struggling child out of therapy with a therapist that she trusts just because she\u2019s not behaving in a way you expect her too. Mental health is a rollercoaster and finding a therapist you gel with and helps you is hard. Your daughter has stated she wants to continue and you threatening to remove her is going to traumatise her. I\u2019d love to hear your daughters side of this story, pretty sure there\u2019s ALOT she\u2019d have to say", "Not when you're denying them a diagnosis, taking them away from a professional them trust and it sounds like you're also the cause of their anxiety.", "Uh, you're literally forcing your daughter to leave therapy just because you haven't seen immediate progress. Therapy takes years for many people. But you're mad that she isn't automatically better so you're forcing her to give up the one person who's helping her. Shame on you. You're a terrible parent. You're so selfish and you clearly don't care at all about your daughter.", "[deleted]", "It kinda does. Reread what your wrote. Children who are loved unconditionally and truly supported don\u2019t necessarily need therapy unless they have been traumatized in some way. \n\nYou are further traumatizing her because she has not made the progress YOU want. Face it, you are not good parent. If you were, you would never threaten to stop her therapy.", "But then you kind of have to listen to what they tell you", "That is very true, you make a good point. With my anxiety issues myself, therapy alone did not work. I\u2019m 54 and have been in and out of therapy since I was 8.  My children have anxiety as well. Medication was not the first thing we tried but when it works it\u2019s extremely helpful. I simply don\u2019t trust a therapist who doesn\u2019t believe in medication. I don\u2019t trust a psychiatrist who doesn\u2019t believe in therapy. Most mental health issues are pretty complicated and need constant adjustment to how we approach them. \n\nI agree with the posters who suggest family therapy. I also note that the OP has some concept that her children will be \u201chealed\u201d which is not how it works. \n\nAll of the therapists my kids have \u201cliked\u201d and has great rapport with have had difficulty getting them to do the work necessary to make changes. I know it\u2019s imperative to trust your therapist but it\u2019s also important to do the work. OP isn\u2019t seeing her daughter do the work, I get that it\u2019s frustrating.", "That\u2019s a possibility, as long as this therapists \u201cbeliefs\u201d about medication don\u2019t interfere.", "They really have been hard on the kids", "An anxiety disorder clearly."]}
