I took my complaints to my fianc\u00e9 but he dismissed me saying that i should \"understand his mother's ways\". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.\n\nAs i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: \"I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills\". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.\n\nTime passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.\n\nThe weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fianc\u00e9.\n\nShe sat down on the bed and said: \"I had a discussion with Luiz (my fianc\u00e9's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request\"\n\n(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)\n\nAbout \"my disease\": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.\n\n I got enraged, and looked at my fianc\u00e9 who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.\n\n\"you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.\"\n\nWhen she said that last line, i exploded, saying \"Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke\".\n\nThe argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fianc\u00e9 there.\n\nWhen he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678820303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rf0it/aita_for_telling_my_mil_not_to_meddle_with_my_and/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
