I took my complaints to my fianc\u00e9 but he dismissed me saying that i should \"understand his mother's ways\". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.\n\nAs i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: \"I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills\". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.\n\nTime passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.\n\nThe weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fianc\u00e9.\n\nShe sat down on the bed and said: \"I had a discussion with Luiz (my fianc\u00e9's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request\"\n\n(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)\n\nAbout \"my disease\": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.\n\n I got enraged, and looked at my fianc\u00e9 who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.\n\n\"you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.\"\n\nWhen she said that last line, i exploded, saying \"Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke\".\n\nThe argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fianc\u00e9 there.\n\nWhen he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678820303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rf0it/aita_for_telling_my_mil_not_to_meddle_with_my_and/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request\"\n\nHUGE RED FLAG. After such a conversation I wouldn't trust any of them. Your fiance has already proved how easily he will jump to his mom's side. I wouldn't be shocked if they tried to mess with your birth control or something. \n\nI can understand the risks related to your health but no one but you has the authority to decide a timeline to have kids. \n\nPlease, find someone who treats you better.", "Sounds like they\u2019re heading into emotional and financial abuse territory if they\u2019re not there already. From the info you\u2019ve given this is not a healthy relationship. The power dynamic with his age is important since you were only 15 when you started dating. This sounds like an incredibly dangerous situation for you and I would seek outside support while you separate incase the abuse escalates.", "Holy moly! Get out NOW!\nHuge NTA - if it was me in your place I\u2019d react so much worse than you did to MIL.\nThe fianc\u00e9 would get a piece of that too. Both of them are garbage and you are just a womb to breed to them.", "NTA - is this the type of future you want? Marrying a boy (yes, boy) who still needs his mommy? Because if you do, you\u2019re signing up for a future of mothering him while simultaneously never being good enough to his actual mothers standards. Also, you\u2019re literally still a teenager. Your brain hasn\u2019t fully formed yet, making lifelong decisions(kids, marriage) at this age is unlikely to earn you future joy. You likely don\u2019t even know who you are yet, you haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. I know that sounds condescending but please trust this internet stranger! Life gets a lot bigger, better, and clearer past 19.", "Don't marry that man. He's still a boy, he's being bossed around by his mom as it seems. His mom will be intolerable. If he didn't put his mom in her place I would break up.", "NTA tell him to go live with mommy,  that is not acceptable your 19 ffs if your in the US you wouldn't be able to drink yet and they are trying to tra you into being a teen mom.  No no  no, it's one thing to choose it anther to think they have any control over that choice.", "Do not marry him!!!! Get out while you can.", "Run, Run, Run, Run, Run. For your own sake..\n\n\nRUN", "NTA please break off the engagement, hes already emotionally married to his mother and you'd be their surrogate for their kid.", "Please for the love of all that is holy take this as the sign you need. You're NINETEEN and you make more sense than all of your partner's family combined. You're still in time op. Run, finish college, build the life you want for yourself. \nNTA please take care of yourself", "NTA. Seriously? Your MIL pushes you to be a teen mum? That's completely fucked up. Even if you have a genetic risk for uterus cancer, it's high;y unlikely you'll get that before 30-40 so you have plenty of time to have a family. Even worse, your BF does not correct his mothers inappropiate meddling. Your lucky you're not married with children yet, run baby run.", "NTA RUN!", "NTA and I\u2019m worried that they\u2019d somehow tamper with your BC. And her basically threatening financial abuse from your fianc\u00e9? Wtf is wrong with her. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds like a momma\u2019s boy and I\u2019d run if I were you. He doesn\u2019t even stand up for you either. Red flags all around.", "RUN!\n\nWho the hell tells a 19 year old it's time to have kids??? Using the church to force a pregnancy? *Your fiance has no back bone in this* \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nYou are NTA but be careful! Lots of people force this onto younger people. People are WAY to obsessed about baby making. \n\n*You are totally fine and it is reasonable to wait when you are not ready.*\n\nThese people are trying to coerce you into a life YOU ARE NOT READY FOR.\n\nThey quite literally are trying to control you using every weapon possible, like a disease you don't even have.", "This. Don\u2019t let him put a ring on it - you\u2019re seeing what it means for him.", "This is the way, OP. Chances are you're too young to be getting married anyway. Most of the siblings in my parents' generation, on both sides of my family, got married young, then got divorced. The only ones who didn't are an aunt whose husband died, and an uncle who died himself.\n\nYou're **definitely** too young to be having children.", "Selling a house now is a lot easier than getting a divorce and splitting assets after many years of marriage and children.", "Even if you lose every penny of the house it's money well spent. Your freedom is worth so so much more. Get your education, ensure that no matter what move you make next you will never have to rely on him or anyone for anything. Please don't let him trap you. It's so much harder to leave them with a baby to consider, trust me on that one.", "Its not an easy decision. But, you should ask yourself \u201cAm I really ready to get married to someone who doesn\u2019t have my back and puts his Mother\u2019s wants and desires above mine?\u201d Also I completely agree with a few other comments that your fianc\u00e9 and MIL will definitely try to take your choice away with kids. So if you do stay, make sure your birth control is protected. When you do talk to your Fianc\u00e9 I would pose the question to him \u201cHow many women do you honestly think would be okay with your Mother demanding they have a baby at 19 years old? You\u2019re only 21 years old, is this even what you want? Or has Mommy dearest warped your mind so much you don\u2019t even know what you want?\u201d If he gives you any bs that \u201cmany women would.\u201d Lol show him your post and the comments. It may be a rude awakening but I think it is the wake up call this Momma\u2019s boy needs.. he sounds really pathetic. Don\u2019t even get me started on the Pastor..who\u2019s her Pastor that he can see the future.. Nostradamus reincarnated? Wtf", "Houses can be sold and rebought. Your life cannot.\n\nYou are still so young to be considering all of these things.\n\nMy gods* have told me that you should run away. \n\n*They're my cats. Excellent judge of character.", "Make it very clear in the talk that it's you or mommy and that if he's choosing you to go no contact with mommy. If he so much as hesitates gtf out of there. I honestly think it's too late. His behavior has been controlling and abusive and I agree that you should talk to your Gyn about a non pill form of birth control. I'm sorry you're in this position but this behavior is inexcusable, and if he's this disrespectful of your boundaries it's only going to get worse.", "He gives your personal medical information to his mother.\n\nHe discussed personal matters with his mother.\n\nHe sides with her against you.\n\nHe wants you to apologise to her.\n\nSeriously cut your losses and get rid of him, it will be worth it in the long run.\n\nETA Its easier to sell a house then deal with 18+ years of control/divorce/child support/etc and be forever linked to this crazy family by a shared child.", "Don't let a house deter you from making a decision. Leaving only gets harder when you add other assets, animals, or kids, but it's never impossible. \n\nYou are smart for recognizing that he and his mother are trying to violate your bodily autonomy. Will you be comfortable with having to fight your MIL with other big decisions in your life? Will your husband respect your medical wishes if something ever happens to you, or will he listen to his mom? Will you trust that you two can make joint decisions on how you will raise your kids without interference? What are some other parts of his personality that currently bother you? Can you live with those things never changing, or getting worse? \n\nThere's nothing wrong with deciding he's the partner you want, but just be absolutely sure you understand what his views are and where he stands. Never a bad choice to do a marriage counseling class too that assess what you both have and have not discussed and where your views do and don't align. \n\nGood luck! (NTA)", "Imagine how hard it will be after he switched your pill or otherwise forced you to get pregnant! You should leave while it is ONLY a house that keeps you together. A child is legally binding too.", "They are right, truth hurts. Which is why no one wants to hear it and it\u2019s not rude. She hasn\u2019t even fully developed for her to make this musta in her life", "I think there is one more problem besides her age. Women are very often taught (I don't know about men, if a man reads this feel free to explain) that love can change a person. We were raised to believe that 'if he loves me he will change for me'. Add her age to this and you have a disaster.\nOP, he won't change. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. If he ever changes it will be for the worse. Marrying him WON'T change him, having kids with him WON'T change him, being good wife WON'T change him. Please, consider going to college or learning new skills, getting a better job, travelling the world, meeting new people, etc...The world is HUGE and there are sooo many opportunities and so many new people to meet. Please don't do this to yourself.\nAlso, NTA.", "Well that's in accordance to what I said. Many people marrying young will regret it. All I requested was not acting as if a certain age group is a monolith without the ability to think", "I know that. What I mean is that they have different degrees of maturity (often depending on their circumstances), different degrees of intelligence and different experiences. And they are of age for a reason. They're not 25 but they're neither stupid nor on the level of a 14 year old and they're not a monolith", "How did the public school system fail me? Btw I'm German where you can have a finished professional education at 19 and without any coast, quite the opposite you get paid for said education. As for me I choose a different and longer path and have a specialised nursing degree that is the same as a bachelor's degree or a master of trade in international score points. I don't feel like I'm uneducated, thank you very much."]}
