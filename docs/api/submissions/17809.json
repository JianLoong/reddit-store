While at lunch, everyone was seemingly in great spirits and just enjoying each other's company while we waited on my 20 y/o brother, \"Jay,\" to arrive. \n\nJay arrives to lunch about 30ish minutes late, and he is visibly upset. Everyone notices and we all turn our attention to Jay, he then let's us know that he just found out this morning that he has type 2 diabetes and is extremely upset about it as anyone would be. At this point, everyone is shocked and is just trying to understand because our family doesn't have a history of diabetes, and we know that this form of diabetes is normally caused through one's diet. As everyone is comforting him and our dad is asking questions, Jay says \"yeah idk I just thought if anyone in our family were to get diabetes it would be Alina(our sister).\" \n\nThat immediately rubbed me the wrong way and then he went on to try to \"explain\" himself my saying that our sister has always been \"the heavier one in the family, so he just didn't understand\". I immediately came to my sisters defense asking Jay wth was wrong with him.  Despite what Jay may think of our sister, she's the most athletic one in our family. Although all of us may work out, my sister was a tennis and wrestling athele since she was 8 years old and still to this day she eats cleaner than anyone, plays tennis almost every morning, and her and her husband are in the gym more than any of us. So I told Jay that what he said was out of line and wrong, and instead of worrying about Alina, he should focus on his own health now. \n\nWhen I said this, my parents came to his defensive like he was some poor wounded animal and telling me that he just found out some devastating news and that I didn't need to hit below the belt.

Not saying his doctors didn't do testing, but I'm someone who was misdiagnosed as Type 2 when I'm actually LADA, a subset of Type 1 where it is a much slower onset than juvenile onset T1. \n\nThat misdiagnosis nearly killed me. And the only testing the doctors for the T2 diagnosis did was check my A1c and my current blood sugar levels. They decided my age, my weight, a family history of T2, and lifestyle were enough factors. And yes, I get that it seems like enough for a T2 diagnosis, but doing bloodwork to test for T1 isn't hard. If you've got any of a few antibodies present, you're a T1. But these tests aren't run unless a doctor requests them because they didn't knee-jerk to a T2 diagnosis.\n\nHopefully your brother gets the help he needs, in diabetic education and in learning how to accept and control his diabetes. No, it's not easy, but it can happen. There's no cure for diabetes but there is control, and T2 can see remission of the disease, the best way to do that is to keep on with the control of symptoms.
