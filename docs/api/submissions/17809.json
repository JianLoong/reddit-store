While at lunch, everyone was seemingly in great spirits and just enjoying each other's company while we waited on my 20 y/o brother, \"Jay,\" to arrive. \n\nJay arrives to lunch about 30ish minutes late, and he is visibly upset. Everyone notices and we all turn our attention to Jay, he then let's us know that he just found out this morning that he has type 2 diabetes and is extremely upset about it as anyone would be. At this point, everyone is shocked and is just trying to understand because our family doesn't have a history of diabetes, and we know that this form of diabetes is normally caused through one's diet. As everyone is comforting him and our dad is asking questions, Jay says \"yeah idk I just thought if anyone in our family were to get diabetes it would be Alina(our sister).\" \n\nThat immediately rubbed me the wrong way and then he went on to try to \"explain\" himself my saying that our sister has always been \"the heavier one in the family, so he just didn't understand\". I immediately came to my sisters defense asking Jay wth was wrong with him.  Despite what Jay may think of our sister, she's the most athletic one in our family. Although all of us may work out, my sister was a tennis and wrestling athele since she was 8 years old and still to this day she eats cleaner than anyone, plays tennis almost every morning, and her and her husband are in the gym more than any of us. So I told Jay that what he said was out of line and wrong, and instead of worrying about Alina, he should focus on his own health now. \n\nWhen I said this, my parents came to his defensive like he was some poor wounded animal and telling me that he just found out some devastating news and that I didn't need to hit below the belt.

While I get that the news was a kind of slap in the face to him, that doesn't give him permission to belittle your sister like that.\n\nI would definitely ask him what testing was done to determine Type 2 diagnosis. Not saying his doctors didn't do testing, but I'm someone who was misdiagnosed as Type 2 when I'm actually LADA, a subset of Type 1 where it is a much slower onset than juvenile onset T1. \n\nThat misdiagnosis nearly killed me. And the only testing the doctors for the T2 diagnosis did was check my A1c and my current blood sugar levels. They decided my age, my weight, a family history of T2, and lifestyle were enough factors. And yes, I get that it seems like enough for a T2 diagnosis, but doing bloodwork to test for T1 isn't hard. If you've got any of a few antibodies present, you're a T1. But these tests aren't run unless a doctor requests them because they didn't knee-jerk to a T2 diagnosis.\n\nHopefully your brother gets the help he needs, in diabetic education and in learning how to accept and control his diabetes. No, it's not easy, but it can happen. There's no cure for diabetes but there is control, and T2 can see remission of the disease, the best way to do that is to keep on with the control of symptoms.

What a lot of people don't realise is, companies compensate for the loss of flavour by adding more sugar... a lot more sugar. Same with the 'healthy' fruit smoothies the man drank every day. Full of sugar. And it's the sugar that raises the risk above and beyond anything else. Then, add in factor number three which is other medical issues and hormonal issues that raise the risk as well. Mine was hyperthyroidism. I had undiagnosed Graves disease as well which triggered the diabetes. A transplant can definitely cure type one diabetes, but I believe it doesn't always work if there are other factors involved in the body... I wish your BIL the best of luck!", "Did you deliberately missed my point (sensible parenting vs GC) and decided to go ad personam?", ">sensible parenting vs GC\n\nWas not your main point.   Sensible parenting was your last 2 words and  just an after thought to your   youngest child is the GC line.   So I reacted as per that. If you want sensible parenting to be your main point, then you need to more talk about it.   \n\n\nAlso the way you said, \"youngest child with golden child crap is so common\" that either you see that in your immediate relations  or have been  going in the society and done a survey.  Doing a survay is very unlikely."]}
