Earlier today, we all went out to lunch with our parents. We all usually try to get together at least once a week, but lately, it's just been so busy for a good majority of us that we haven't been able to do so. While at lunch, everyone was seemingly in great spirits and just enjoying each other's company while we waited on my 20 y/o brother, \"Jay,\" to arrive. \n\nJay arrives to lunch about 30ish minutes late, and he is visibly upset. Everyone notices and we all turn our attention to Jay, he then let's us know that he just found out this morning that he has type 2 diabetes and is extremely upset about it as anyone would be. At this point, everyone is shocked and is just trying to understand because our family doesn't have a history of diabetes, and we know that this form of diabetes is normally caused through one's diet. As everyone is comforting him and our dad is asking questions, Jay says \"yeah idk I just thought if anyone in our family were to get diabetes it would be Alina(our sister).\" \n\nThat immediately rubbed me the wrong way and then he went on to try to \"explain\" himself my saying that our sister has always been \"the heavier one in the family, so he just didn't understand\". I immediately came to my sisters defense asking Jay wth was wrong with him.  Despite what Jay may think of our sister, she's the most athletic one in our family. Although all of us may work out, my sister was a tennis and wrestling athele since she was 8 years old and still to this day she eats cleaner than anyone, plays tennis almost every morning, and her and her husband are in the gym more than any of us. So I told Jay that what he said was out of line and wrong, and instead of worrying about Alina, he should focus on his own health now. \n\nWhen I said this, my parents came to his defensive like he was some poor wounded animal and telling me that he just found out some devastating news and that I didn't need to hit below the belt. I don't feel as though I threw any jabs at him, yet my parents are insisting I the BOTH of us were wrong.

He's a grown man, not a toddler, but if your parents always coddle him the way they did in this instance, I can see why he's behaving so childishly.\n\nAs an aside, type 2 diabetes is one of the easiest to manage. My dad was diagnosed, did some research into low-carb diets and their impact on diabetes type 2, and has been in remission from it for over a decade. If your brother is prepared to do it, this can easily be managed and not have a big impact on his life. To do that, he needs to get over his immaturity.

No\n\nNo matter the diagnosis, if you\u2019re going to start spouting shit at an individual - unless you are quite literally cognitively impaired, there is no excuse. You deserve to be told to mind your own business the minute you decide to insult another person for things they cannot control", "NTA \n\nHe fat shamed your sister which is not appropriate in any capacity. \n\nWhile I understand he was upset and processing it, that\u2019s no reason to drag someone else down .. you\u2019re right in protecting your sister.

My mom has been doing it to her since she was a child, and don't get me wrong, my sister has stood up for herself in the past, but at some point Ik she stopped trying because those people didn't care, so I'm always going to stand up for her against whomever it is, at least as long as I'm in the vicinity.", "I disagree. He bought his sister into it by shaming her about her weight. He had no right to do that just because he\u2019s \u201cyounger\u201d or diagnosed with diabetes. You\u2019re still supposed to treat people with respect.. the sister didn\u2019t do anything to him to make him make that remark. Except be fat. Which must be the ultimate sin to him. It\u2019s not right for him to go after her despite his diagnosis. In a time like that you need support from everyone around you, and you don\u2019t go around alienating people who have done nothing to you except exist. It was very cruel", "so he gets to act like an immature child throwing insults to make himself feel better? i get that he got some hard news but he is a grown adult and shouldn\u2019t have to bring his sister down so he can get a quick ego boost.", "Type 2 sometimes goes into remission, and in theory can do so indefinitely.", "If caught early type 2 is reversible with the help of a good diet and exercise.", "what the hell is wrong with him is he just got diagnosed with a life changing disease\n\nstop virtue signaling\n\nfocus on HIM - your sister doesn\u2019t want this to be about her either", "> but at some point Ik she stopped trying\n\nI know how she feels.\n\nThis is really one of those points that's going to be a personal conversation with her, and I may be off base about it, so no judgement from me. My thought however is that she may not have wanted you to even try, and in doing so you may have done more harm with your relationship with her, than helped.\n\nAnyways, no judgement. What a horrible situation all around.\n\nI'll leave you with this, it's something that's helped me, and may help you and your sister.\n\n>\u201cIf you are willing to look at another person's behavior toward you as a reflection of the state of their relationship with themselves rather than a statement about your value as a person, then you will, over a period of time cease to react at all.\u201d \u2015 Yogi Bhajan.", "Also I\u2019m confused about what exactly she said that would be considered \u2018below the belt\u2019.

No need to \"defend\" anyone. Just call the guy out and move on.", "it should be about defending the sister. he\u2019s throwing insults for NO reason and he shouldn\u2019t be coddled for it cause that just gives him permission to do it again next time he\u2019s upset about something.", "why is there no need to defend the sister? he said something out of line and untrue. he deserves to have it explained to him exactly why he\u2019s wrong.", "WTF is wrong with YOU?\n\nDiabetes is not NO REASON\n\nHe\u2019s lashing out.  he\u2019s not a stranger - it\u2019s their brother\n\ntheir YOUNGEST sibling\n\nwere you an only child or something??", "> why is there no need to defend the sister?\n\nWhat would it accomplish?\n\nIn the eyes of the individual, any comment in response will have no chance of changing their mind in that moment, or perhaps in the future, and more than anything acts as confirmation to that individual that they were right.

I get that he's upset, but that's no excuse to insult your sister.", "NTA. Your brother is such a dick.
