Today while all the dogs are playing my dog as usual was chasing another dog who had a ball in her mouth. As the they run my dog tries to grab the ball from the other dogs mouth. As kinda growls while she does it rotties are vocal sometimes. I was next to the owner of the other dog and I told him that she\u2019s friendly and not to worry she\u2019s just playing. He responded with \u201cit better not bite my dog\u201d. \n\nI assured him that wouldn\u2019t happen. Fast forward 2 mins same interaction dogs running my dog growls as she tries to get the ball while they are both mid run. The guy comes up to he\u2019s like 60 years old I\u2019m like 25. He grabs me by the back of my jacket and starts yelling that my dog bit his dog. I instantly tell him to get his hands of me and ask him what the fuck he\u2019s doing touching me and back the fuck up.\n\nHe just stands in front of me and repeats yelling that his dog was bit. The dogs weren\u2019t fighting ever my dog is doing her own thing at this point not paying attention to the other dog anymore even. I ask him to show me where the dog was bit. We go over and there\u2019s no marks or scratches or anything no dogs ever yelped or anything either. Since I do not know this guy and he is also with his 2 daughters I keep trying to avoid physical confrontion with this guy as there\u2019s a lot of crazy ppl out there as well and I\u2019m not taking a chance on a weapon or at best case jail for me. \n\nI keep trying to be level headed and even trying to explain the rotties are vocal the growls don\u2019t means she\u2019s fighting. But he keeps getting in my face closer and closer his face is still beet red. I tell him he\u2019s obviously not a reasonable person and that there\u2019s no reason for us to be talking anymore. I get my dog and leave. I kinda feel like I should\u2019ve said more or done something but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nNote: my dog is super friendly was playing with little kids in the park super gently they\u2019re petting her in front of the guy so there\u2019s no reason for him to assume she\u2019s aggressive to begin with.\n\nEdit: there wasn\u2019t any issues to begin with. He didn\u2019t ask me to control my dog I proactively started a conversation with him the first time she growled to ease his mind because I know not everybody has vocal dogs and the second time she growled is when he came up to me. growling is just a noise there was no interaction at all.

But for dogs that aren't ok with it, it's on the owner to train their dogs to leave dogs alone that may not like their behavior. The other dog was minding its own business, so it's on you and your dog to leave them alone if the growling etc. bothers them.\n\nDifferent dogs are going to respond differently to different things -- but ALL dogs at the park should know how to leave another dog or their toys alone when told to do so.\n\nIf your dog hasn't learned how to consistently \"leave it\" when told to do so, then leash them until they're trained or while that other dog is there.

Those people are there to enjoy the dog park too, not be nervous and anxious in regards to a strangers animal that they don't know from Adam.\n\nAs an owner, you should have asked if it's OK for your animal to play with them in the first place.

And she might not become aggressive from it, but she could freak the wrong dog out doing such and cause them to lash out and instigate aggression because of her unchecked boisterous behaviours. Her chasing dogs who are trying to play with their toys isn\u2019t good, and will eventually cause a problem. Her being so boisterous is going to cause problems and piss off other dogs and other owners. \n\nObviously this guy grabbing you and getting in your face is nuts and not going about it the right way- but you needed to be more proactive than \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d and letting your dog make other dogs and people uneasy.  \n\nThere\u2019s a dog that gets walked on same dog field I walked mine on.

He\u2019d sit next to me and tuck his head towards me and if the dog ran past him he\u2019d scrunch his face in a growl motion. He was clearly so fucking pissed off by this other dog.

The whole point is to let dogs go out off leash and run, play, and socialize with other dogs. I think a lot of people just read Rottweiler and just, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019d be more worried about getting bit by the tiny purse dogs.

Idk if these E S H voters have actually been to a dog park.\n\nMy guess is that this guy doesn't like rotties since they are notorious for being aggressive.

Mine only survived because the owner of the German shepherd was a vet (she wasn\u2019t the one walking the dog that day) \nFor everyone\u2019s well being you need to make sure not to let the dog off leash if she\u2019s behaving the way you\u2019re describing. \n\nPs: my encounter started with growling as well it went from growling to rivers of blood in seconds. \nMore than 20 years later I\u2019m still terrified of similar encounters because of dismissive owners who think their dogs will never escalate. \n\nNo official judgement but it should still be kinda implied.", "ESH. You need to train your dog, but the guy should definitely not have grabbed you. Your dog should not be chasing after other dogs who are playing fetch with their owners. Train your dog.", "ESH. train your damn dog. Even if you\u2019re not at a dog park, say your dog got off leash and went to my dog and all you have to say is \u201cthey\u2019re friendly\u201d, I don\u2019t care mine isn\u2019t. But yes his reaction is bad too. Dog parks overall are not good places. Find a gated baseball field and have your dog run or daycare where they actually correct their dog\u2019s behavior", "The problem with dog parks are how volatile and unpredictable they can be. Dog fights can break out at random and be BAD. People are cray cray.\n\nI would avoid dog parks during the \"peak hours\" typically mornings and evenings during the week day. People use their dog parks to exercise their dogs instead of just socialization. So you will get very energetic animals who've been cooped up all day and excitement very easily turns to aggression.\n\nI personally avoid them full stop. Its not work the potential and inevitable drama. \n\nBut if you do go take your dog for a longish walk prior. Get out some of the energy and excitement. And avoid the park if you see this guy or other aggressive dogs/owners. Sorry this weirdo assaulted you tho. If your dog was really biting his you would think he would've grabbed your dog, not you. Like I said, weirdo. Your NTA", "That is a great idea! Dogs love nature trails. All of the smells to investigate. Your dog park sucks. But I do think it is not a good idea to bring toys. Otherwise the dogs will go Lord of the Flies on everyone.", "NTA. I see dogs do this all the time. It\u2019s a play growl. I think the only advice I\u2019d offer is to train your dog to come when you call it away from chasing. Sounds like the guy is the problem and the dogs are all fine with each other.", "Dog parks are dangerous. Period. There's always someone with a bad dog or a crazy owner. \n\nPpl are going to act aggressively with a rottie running around. They'll always blame it and you for everything.  If another dog ever attacks it, you'll be the one blamed because it's a rottie. \n\nI simply stay away from dog parks. A recipe for disaster.", "The thing is, you are expecting people to trust you, just b/c you trust your dog, or believe what you are saying is true. But their first concern is their dog's safety. If you have a dog who is making other people feel unsafe, or that their dogs are unsafe, it IS your responsibility to handle/remediate/train that away. No dog park until you've got that under control. It's not for everyone else to make you feel okay and take what you say at face value. Your dog has some aggressive-seeming traits. I wouldn't trust you or your dog either, based on what you say, with evidence that seems to contradict it. YTA.", "as a fellow Rottie owner (I love the rottie purr that they do. Best sound) I was told by my trainer to never take River to a dog park. No matter what happens she would be blamed because of her breed. It doesn't matter how friendly, well trained she could be. It will always be her fault and he was right. The amount of looks and lectures on how dangerous she is while she is sleeping on my feet and their dog is being the obnoxious one. I feel your pain...", "Yep to all of this. \n\nThe other guy shouldn\u2019t have attacked OP or gotten into his space.\n\nBUT \n\nIf your dog is running after other dogs and trying to grab toys right out of their mouths, while growling, that dog shouldn\u2019t be running with strange dogs at dog parks. Maybe growling is just a breed characteristic of the rottie, but neither the other dog nor the other dog\u2019s owner KNOW THAT. Nor do they know your dog to trust you at your word that spite the chasing, biting towards the head of the other dog (because that\u2019s what your dog trying to grab the ball looks like) or growling is friendly, and not only will the owner interpret it as attacking, the other dog might as well, and FIGHT BACK if it feels threatened. It\u2019s not your dogs fault it\u2019s a \u2018scary breed\u2019, but it is. Too many dog attacks happen at dog parks, that if a dog starts growling and snapping for a toy and the owner doesn\u2019t immediately call it back, it is rational to consider it a threat to the dog it\u2019s snapping and growling at. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve literally had to lift a mini poodle I was walking (on lead) to escape a bull terrier that went for it who\u2019s owner didn\u2019t care until I was bleeding. I don\u2019t mess around with dog parks anymore. \n\nAlso, your dog wasn\u2019t safe in this situation. Goldens actually have a risk of being reactive if their not well bred, and no good golden breeder is letting their stock produce doodles. Therefore, a golden doodle has a higher chance of having the reactive golden gene. Don\u2019t assume a goldendoodle won\u2019t snap, because they\u2019re actually quite likely to.", "Do people not know not to bring toys to dog parks? They are seen as high value items by many dogs and likely to spark fights as some dogs can be possessive and cause conflict.\n\nThe only time I've seen toys be ok is when people bring 4 or 5 tennis balls. No dog can hoard all of them and that seems to lessen the possibility of fights. The person who brought the tennis balls can do fetch drills with their dog while all the other dogs are distracted by the other balls.", "It\u2019s a dig park with im sure lots of other dogs running around. Your suggestion isn\u2019t realistic", "Oof when I heard \"she's friendly she's just playing\" i froze up,  I've had so many big dogs jump up on me without leashes out and about and been freaking out and that phrase is all the owners can offer me while I struggle and panic", "The amount of dogs who chase mine while he's playing fetch is insane. He's reached the point he starts showing the teeth and if pushed nipping (he's a border collie) the younger ones. No hurting them, he's too sweet for that. But he makes sure they know he's not bloody happy! All the owners just shrug until our dog gets pissed off. Then they start to hurry their dog away, all while glaring at us.", "Same.  I don\u2019t know why people bring their dogs to off-leash parks.  Most don\u2019t watch and pay attention to their dogs, don\u2019t clean up after their dogs, and you can never rely on anyone\u2019s dog to be properly trained or even updated on vaccines.  Disaster waiting to happen.  No thank you.", "So do I. My dog was attacked at a dog park and my vet said they tell owners to never use a dog park.

And there are no toys!", "Yes I am not even surprised this happened at a dog park.", "My dogs loved playing \"chase\" (dog version of tag) when they were younger so i would take them to the dog park often. Thankfully didnt really have negative experiences though. As they got older they prefered walking and running through the forest and now theyre both seniors and cant walk far at all. Since then i have heard countless horror stories about dog parks and i if i were to get another dog i dont think i would take it to a dog park.", "We took my friends Rottie after my friend had a relapse of cancer. This dog is from hell. She never should have adopted her. She could never handle her. The dog is incredibly smart and has a knack for trouble. She's good with us because we do rescue and have a lot of experience with rehabbing naughty dogs. Plus we live on a farm and have other big dogs she can wrestle with. But she is still A LOT of dog. I wouldn't recommend a Rottweiler to anyone who did not have significant experience with big, aggressive dogs. \n\nWe also recently took in a Bull Mastiff from an elderly couple who couldn't handle her. This dog is so strong it takes two adults to walk her safely. I wish shelters would be more discriminating about what dogs they adopt to whom. But I also realize they are trying to get those dogs out of their to save there lives.", "Wasn\u2019t a small dog it was a golden doodle", "He didn\u2019t ask me to do anything I preempted him the first time she growled and he responded she better not bite. Second time he heard a growl while they were running is when he came up to me. I have no issue separating my dog from yours if you bring up a concern.", "You\u2019re one of those dog owners that think any time a dog growls that means it\u2019s vicious.

I saytake accountability and control what you can first, no wait I think my dogs in danger, let me yell at a stranger and assault him", "Read my edit", "I had to scroll way too far for this comment. It's apparent many of the ESH people are not dog owners and don't go to dog parks often. I find it's rarer for dogs NOT to growl when playing.

NTA", "Those E-SH/Y-TAs are probably from people who aren't familiar with the breed or dog body language.\n\nMy dog is a vocal shepherd, and it's super frustrating when I get the same response. I literally pull my dog away to let the other owner see their dog is the one relentlessly coming back at my dog to ask for more play. They don't believe it's consensual play until I literally pry them apart for the other owner to see.\n\nYou gotta keep in mind that the people who are physically inside the dog park are most likely not dog trainers. Most do not care to learn more about the topic either.", "Btw I have a 20pd terrier who growls when playing and also nips. He is the sweetest and most submissive little guy. And in part because he is little his yappiness is looked at as being harmless, which it is. \n\nBut I can understand someone being a bit more concerned if a larger dog is growling. My large bluetick coonhound liked to jump on us as a puppy. We had to train him not to as he's so big he will knock you over. Whereas the terrier can jump on laps. Gotta be on top of the training with big dogs especially.", "They're called \"dog parks\" because \"disease ridden fight club for dogs\" is too long for the signs.", "I bring a chuck it ball to my dog park.

He was able to play with others by the time we stopped going back and hasn\u2019t had a reaction since before then. But some owners bring their reactive dogs in with no care. And sick dogs too. The last time I went a German shepherd ran up to mine straight out of the gate and attacked him. I left and never went back. My dog and I are happier taking walks alone in the woods anyway lol.", "Because people bitch and complain if you let your dog run around off leash in an area that isn't a dog park. How are these dogs suppose to run and burn energy?", "Well then maybe your parks just suck. My dog has been attacked 4 times. All 4 times were loose dogs in the neighborhood while we were walking on a leash. Not once in the 12 years we have been going to dog parks, has he been attacked at a park. I've never stepped in dog poop there. Pooch and I are actually headed to the dog park now.\n\nThe worst thing I ever witnessed was about 8 dogs trying to jump and climb all over a couple. But that was their own fault. You don't bring cheeseburgers into a dog park and expect to have a private picnic.", "I agree 100%! A lot of people do not realize the skill it takes to continuously reinforce training. Certain breeds require more skill than others. These dogs like children, will one day grow up and be part of society. In society you have rules on how you must act. If you cannot give your dogs the skills to set them up to succeed you are dooming them to an uncertain future. \n\nSome dog people assume just because they love dogs that it is enough to be able to take on any breed! Unfortunately it usually ends terribly for one or both of them! If you aren\u2019t willing to put in the constant hard work then don\u2019t adopt or buy them! In the long run it is abusive to them, whether your physically hurting, starving, or neglecting their social learning needs!!", "Still smaller than a rotty, right?
