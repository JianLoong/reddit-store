He's nice enough but has never been the type I envisioned for my daughter. And last year my daughter came to me in peices, it turns out he had been having an affair. They went to counseling and she says that they have made great improvements to their marriage but I don't buy it. \n\nThey have been anticipating moving to our rental house, so this weekend I talked to my daughter and told her how I felt. I told her I was thinking of taking back my offer, just because I find the idea of living close to her husband to be stressful.
