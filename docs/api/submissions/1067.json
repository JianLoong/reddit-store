If you invested 40k in this, you need to get out with a lot more than 16k.", "NTA, but you need legal advice not moral advice.", "Agree that this is a lawyer situation, which is frustrating because that'll probably leave you further in debt either way. \n\nFigure out what you actually want, and what you're willing to accept, first.", "I think you will get better advice if you post on the legal advice sub", "NTA. This needs a professional lawyer to handle it.", "NTA *at all* for the main question of your post. But you do need to get a lawyer involved. If this man is trying to convince you to just give a whole-ass business away, I\u2019m concerned he\u2019ll try and take advantage of you given any other opportunity.", "NTA", "He can go. You keep the business. And go talk to lawyer please before you're left with a massive debt by this guy.

As others are saying, it's time to talk to an attorney.", "NTA you need the whole 40K back minus any profits made. Why just 16K? Its crazy not to get it all/alot more back if he wants to take it all over. The business would not exisit without it, the potential which he will take forward until its running a profit would not have happened without the 40K. Why do you lose that? If he cant pay it to you - then you keep a share of the business.\n\nFind out everything you paid into the business directly and then also get your bank statements out about the time you subsidised him for 7 months.", "NTA\n\nHowever, as most other comments are saying, you need to seek proper legal advice.", "Honestly, I'd be asking for more than the $16k due to the additional paperwork of transferring everything over. You supported him AND the business for far longer. But don't take less than that for the debt you've incurred.\n\nNTA. And he isn't buying you out, he's buying the business entirely. Just keep in mind that depending on the type of business, he can also just start his own with a new name.", "It is morally unreasonable for him to expect you to walk away from things you are still in debt for. \n\nSeek legal council. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "You need a lawyer not Reddit", "\"I legally own the business in its entirety.\"\n\nWhich makes the fiance your employee.

If you  were sole owner and decided to walk away,  what would you get?  If you sold, what is the valuation of the company?\n\nIf you  really were co owners,  the expectation would be equitable distribution of assets and debt.\n\nAll that said, if you legally own the business,  he should  buy you out, at whatever  valuation  could be agreed upon.  I question  a few things, because  doing all the paperwork for a partnership or llc usually  entails defining ownership percentages in your  formal documents. \n\nIf the intent was co ownership,  you either become  a silent partner  or one partner buys the other out.\n\nHalf of incurred debtight be reasonable,  but if there is a higher or lower valuation,  it may not be the case.\n\nYour offer of 16k is reasonable IMO.", "NTA. It\u2019s your business. You can choose to sell it to him or not. Sucks to be him since he made a decision to allow you to take all the risk and him only benefit.

Talk to a lawyer, please.", "INFO what happens to the business if your ex stops working it? Will both of you have nothing?\n\nIt sounds like you two should have been 50-50 if the business were profitable. However 50% of nothing is nothing. \n\nI would have your lawyer draft an agreement to set out how your ex pays you back over time with the profits. Make sure that you have audit and access rights so that he can\u2019t do anything dodgy with the books."]}
