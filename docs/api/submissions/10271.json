Some people absolutely will not stop themselves and cannot have a good time without drinking or think there needs to be drinks to have fun. This cost you a lot and she ruined it with her foolishness.

Don't hangout with her again. Not worthy.", "NTA but you really spent how much and didn't stay for the music!?! Single lady right here, I go all of the time to stuff by myself. You sound responsible and could have stopped drinking to enjoy. So weird. Anyway, yeah someone screws you over so bad because they want to get plastered. You cut that person off. What kind of friend is she to put you in such a situation.", "NTA. Tbh i am still a bit bitter about the time I went to Voodoo fest like 12 years ago and my partners best friend took a bunch of acid that she knew she couldn't handle and he had to care for her rather than us being able to enjoy the festival to its fullest. Especially since it was my 1 and only music festival I've ever been to cause I got pregnant the next yea.\n\nYour feelings on this are completely valid and I'm sorry your experience got ruined.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nShe ruined the event for you by being irresponsible. It seems clear also that she wasn't really into the music. Why did she go in the first place?\n\nWho knows how she'll sabotage the next event?", "NTA\nShe did things to make herself sick. It was avoidable. Seems like even if she hadn't left you were pretty much on your own at the festval anyway. Doesn't seem like she was apologetic.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting to hang out with her again.", "So true, I remember during a night out I just didn\u2019t feel like drinking and everyone around me made it their mission to make me drink that night. Super annoying. I  do drink but it isn\u2019t a requirement for me to have a good time.

These folks are entitled and no fun, skip meeting up with her OP.", "NTA\n\nTell her why. You spent a fortune and she fully ruined it. \n\nIt could happen to anyone but you make it right.", "Nta,I would not want spend time with her, you warned her in the beginning to pace herself and drink water. Your friend is selfish", "op=NTA\n\nShe acted dreadfully, and that's a lot of money lose out on just for drinking.  \n\nIf you choose not to be friends anymore, that is your choice, but be honest at least.  Don't ghost her. Let her learn from this.", "Recently had dinner with 7 people - mostly Italians. In a 3 hour dinner, we had 1 bottle & maybe a half of wine. No liquor or beer.\n\nIt was the conversation and the company that made it such a pleasurable night."]}
