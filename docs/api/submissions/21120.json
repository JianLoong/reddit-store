Now let me stop right here and clarify for those of you who are unaware that this is **not** maple syrup.  Maple syrup is made from the sap of maple trees.  This shit is just HFCS with artificial flavoring and coloring agents.  It is **not** the same thing.  It's too thick and has no actual taste except \"obnoxiously sweet.\"  I used to live in New England and would literally rather not eat pancakes than eat them with \"syrup.\"\n\nI asked her if that was the only syrup they had, and she said yes.  I said, \"I really don't want to be a pain, but I asked if you had maple syrup, and you said yes, but this isn't maple syrup.  Could you take the pancakes back and remove them from the check?\"  She said she'd get the manager.  It took him a minute or two to come over, during which my girlfriend and I ate a few bites of the rest of our food (but I didn't touch the pancakes).\n\nHe came over and asked me what the problem was.  I explained it and again asked for him to take the pancakes back and just charge me for the eggs/bacon/sausage/hash browns since I specifically asked the waitress if they had maple syrup before ordering.  He said no because \"it's the same thing.\"  I said no it isn't and told him that if he wanted to play that game then I'd just stop eating now and walk out without paying for anything.  He said that he can't refund food after it's served, and I again said that I was not going to be paying for food that was not served the way I was told it would be.  He finally relented and took them off the bill.\n\nAITA here?  I asked my girlfriend, and she just said, \"I don't know babe.

Maybe both.", "That is not even remotely close to what happened. \n\nThe proper comparison would be that you got pissed when they brought out store bought salsa when you wanted freshly made salsa after you walked in and asked \"Do you have salsa?\"", "That's not what happened. They came out with a salsa that you think isn't \"real salsa\" because it didn't have tomatoes in it, just tomato paste. It's on YOU to verify that the salsa uses real tomatoes if you care.", "it is your first time eating out ? It's like asksing for orange juice you expect them to give you fresh pressed orange juice or the concentrat ? \n\nNext time ask what kind of syrip they have instead of making a scene . It is obvious if the restaurant is cheap that you don't get premium quality . you can't blame the waitress since she serves what is there . I bet she was confused why you were asking about it . And what do you do if you get salsa you don't like ? Do you refuse to pay even thought it is salsa but salsa which doesn't suit your taste ?", "I probably couldn't tell the difference, but I personally don't use syrup for anything.", "Oh sweet lord\u2026 what you are talking about are brands. Maple is not a brand, it it a plant that is used to make syrup. With artificial syrup, there is no maple inside, so in your example, he would have asked for mustard and would have gotten mayonnaise. \nIt\u2019s two different products and they have very different tastes.", "This comparison isn't the same though bc those are both still called mustard. Maple syrup means 100% maple syrup - it could be a cheap grade, but it's still real maple syrup. Imitations are usually called table syrup or maple flavoured syrup. This comparison is like if OP just asked for syrup and assumed it would be maple.\n\n\\*Btw - I think Op and the manager both overreacted, and the server just made an honest mistake.", "If Hinze has no actual mustard in it, yeah.", "He asked for maple syrup. He wasn't given it. He was told, incorrectly, that the restaurant had something that they did not. Therefore, it is on the restaurant to fix the issue.", "bruh everybody knows what real maple syrup is.   \n\nI agree it\u2019s superior but I also wasn\u2019t born under a rock and realize that the cheaper alternative is EXTREMELY common. Enough so that the name \u201cmaple syrup\u201d is interchangeable. I mean who the fuck just calls it\u2019s high fructose corn syrup. \n\nIf you wanted a specific item, you should have asked specifically for REAL maple syrup. \n\nIn the nicest way possible, as a server, making a scene over that is embarrassing.

Get your head out of your ass and stop giving us a bad name.", "And in my experience, as a lifelong New Englander, it's bananas to me that you are using your time in Rhode Island as a reason for your snobbery in regards to the syrup. Quahogs, oysters, little necks, chowder-sure! Not so much maple syrup. You got the pancakes removed from the bill. Thank goodness for semantics. And the culture is wonderfully different from state to state. That's why it's so cool to live here. I would have thought it obnoxious of you to refuse to pay for food because the server was unaware that Mrs. Butterworth's wasn't the same as maple syrup.

These laws would give OP the right to a refund/taken off the bill in this instance if it happened here.", "Does this mean hot dogs are actually made from dogs that are heated?", "And you seem to not have arguments about the topic, which is syrup, that\u2019s why we are all here talking about syrup,  and start insulting people.", "Thanks to reddit, actually.

It is described as being much sweeter and stickier than the real thing.", "You think that it's worth this level of conflict to get a refund on a couple of pancakes?

It would be good if people knew the difference between maple syrup and much more unhealthy cheap artificial/corn syrup. Asking which kind a restaurant serves is important if you have allergies, health problems etc. If you sell syrup as maple syrup, it\u2019s a scam and potentially dangerous. By complaining about it OP made the staff more sensitive for the subject, which is the right way to go, even if he did it because he just likes it.", "sorry but this is not accurate - I do agree that Op overreacted (as well as the manager), but the server made an honest mistake about this. \"Maple syrup\" *is* 100% maple syrup - it could be a cheap grade, but it's real or it's false advertising. The imitation stuff is usually called table syrup or maple flavoured syrup.

It's the same as asking for butter and getting margarine, or cheddar and getting craft singles - (as least culturally in Canada  I think this example fits).\n\nTo be clear though, I think Op way overreacted and could have saved the server from making an honest mistake by simply confirming whether it was real.", "[removed]", "When you ask and specify maple and they say yes it's not exactly the same thing.
