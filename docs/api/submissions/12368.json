{"id": 12368, "submission_id": "11s3lnd", "title": "AITA for forcing my younger sister to sell our family home after our mom died", "selftext": "So. My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.\n\nThere's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2. And my mother did not get the will witnessed or notarized which in Florida is needed to uphold a will.\n\nSister1 has been living in this house for about 10 years now. But every lawyer we've talked to has said that it doesn't matter the house will be split three ways by a judge. \n\nSister1 wants to keep the house, even though she can't afford the mortgage. And technically she can't even keep it since it belongs to all 3 of us. She's saying I'm an asshole because I'm not giving up my third of the house to her like our mom wanted. AND for not helping her pay the mortgage she can't afford. She's refusing to start any of the process needed to put the house under the three siblings names and sell it. So we can try to sell it.\n\nIf we don't sell it, and she misses any of the mortgage payments the house could be lost and then no one gets anything. I offered to help with the mortgage for 6 months to hopefully sell the house in that time. But she's still saying I'm not doing enough to help her keep the house and should be helping for longer while she continues to drag her feet and prolonged having to split the house three ways.\n\nNext week I'm going to go above her and start the process myself since technically any of the three of us can do it. She hasn't even told Sister2 that she has a claim to the house. She's been trying to find loopholes to cut her off since she was estranged from us. But sorry. Legally she has a right to a third of the house. She also wants us to buy her out, but I don't have that kind of money and I have no problem with the house being split.\n\nI dont understand why I should be expected to give up my legal right to a third, and help her pay the mortgage.\n\nEDIT: Seems like a 30/70 in favor of being the asshole. I'll say this, both Sister1 and I have helped our mom financially and medically. When I came back and it looked like it was turning bad. I had already assumed my mom had left the house to Sister1. And while I get the emotional part of this, every lawyer Sister1 and I have talked to say that Sister2 is getting a third. I refuse to have Sister2 take a third, while Sister1 takes her third and mine while I get nothing. But thanks for the comments and takes\n\nEDIT2: Ppl keep asking about the 90% and 10%. Sister1 is 30, but she lived at home for 10 years with no real bills. She did this straight out of college not because our mom needed any type of care. She only paid $150 in rent for those 10 years, and wasn't even working full time. I do understand why my mom would have wanted her to have the largest share since from her POV Sister1 has no income or honestly anything else. And sister2 getting nothing also make sense as her fallout with our mom was very big. But both Sister1 and I helped with mom's bills and medical care when needed. I even paid for my mom's life insurance for about 2 years. \n\nIt's really Sister1's denial that unless I help with the mortgage she's losing the house that's getting me. Sister2 is getting her third whether we like it or not. Sister1 is not going to be able to keep the house. Her dragging her feet is going to cost me money, not from the house, but because I'm going to have to pay for this mortgage to make sure we dont lose the house before its sold. And even if I do that, Im expected to give up my third?", "created_utc": 1678902375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s3lnd/aita_for_forcing_my_younger_sister_to_sell_our/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How often did you help out with some of the heavier caregiving duties? I can tell you that if it was something like Alzheimer's, a stroke, or cancer, it's mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting. Plus, most family caregivers are unpaid, so that 10 years of lost income, retirement savings, and a social life is detrimental.

My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.\n\nThere's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2. And my mother did not get the will witnessed or notarized which in Florida is needed to uphold a will.\n\nSister1 has been living in this house for about 10 years now.

Based on the comments that you have made so far and have been uncovered elsewhere, I can't avoid the impression that some creative storytelling is going on to make you look like you're NTA. Legally, you and the other sister might be entitled to a third each but morally, neither of you are. This is the kind of thing that routinely gets blamed on lawyers but the truth is that your greed and unethical behaviour is driving the decision.", "NAH here. Because grief is very powerful, and your mother has been gone for a week. And while you may be looking ahead to clear the estate, your sister hasn't had time to process everything. Nor, really, have you.\n\nNo decisions need to be made right now. Just focus on getting the documents together for probate, sending out all the copies of the death certificates, and take time for all of you to mourn.\n\nIf you and Sister 3 agree to it, the house doesn't have to be split. For one example, even if there's nothing else in the estate that can equal 2/3 of the value of the home, you can voluntarily renounce your claims. Not saying your family should do this, just that it's an option and there are others. It all comes down to what the three of you can agree on. But if you all fight each other, the house will be sold, the mortgage cleared, and the remaining proceeds split three ways.\n\nProbate for my mom's very simple estate took five months in 2022. You have time to think things through, get free consultations from multiple estate lawyers, and talk to each other.\n\nBut the mortgage does still need to be paid. If there's any cash left in the estate, you can likely pay it out of that as the mortgage is still in your mom's name and the debt currently belongs to the estate. But if Sister 1 does inherit the house, she has to come to grips with the fact that she also inherits the mortgage and the sole responsibility to pay it. But today is not the best day for that intervention.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. My best advice is to just try to give everyone some grace. You, your mom, and your sisters.", "You greedy arsehole.

The estate would then be split 50/50 between sister #1 and the estranged sister.\n\nThe only solution to stick to mom's wishes is to have both OP & estranged sister legally decline the inheritance but somehow have a legal document that states that OP gets 10% if the house is subsequently sold. That takes agreement between all the sisters and at least 1 lawyer.\n\n\nAgain, I don't know where OP lives or any other circumstances here, but it isn't as simple as everyone is making it out.

Sister2 can force us to sell and get her third.\nIt's really Sister1's denial that unless I help with the mortgage she's losing the house that's getting me. Sister2 is getting her third whether we like it or not. Sister1 is not going to be able to keep the house. Her dragging her feet is going to cost me money, not from the house, but because I'm going to have to pay for this mortgage to make sure we dont lose the house before its sold.

They must also find all creditors who have to be paid before figuring out the net value of the estate. \n\n If sister 1, **no matter how deserving**, cannot afford the house without OP paying the mortgage, she can't afford the house. The mortgage will need to be refinanced out of mom's name. How will sister 1 qualify for that? It can't be done while there will be a court issued lien for the 2/3 owed to the other siblings. There could also be a lien for lawyer fees, credit cards, taxes, health care bills, utilities, etc.  OP keeping 10% (mom's wish) and gifting the difference of the 1/3 to sister 1 fixes nothing. Giving up their entire 1/3 fixes nothing. Who pays sister 2 her share? OP again? Plus, you can't just gift someone (in the US) more than $17K without triggering gift taxes of up to 18-40% of the gift.  That is paid by the giver, so more money for OP to pay.

Sorry, but that is pretty specific advice that is bad advice from both a legal and tax perspective.\n\nIf you had just said \"You should be doing everything you can legally to fulfill your mother's intent,\" I wouldn't have responded.\n\nThe reality is, based on OP's statements, it doesn't even sound like the sister will be able to keep the house, even if OP and estranged sister give their portuons to her. All 3 sister's need a reality check on what the options are.", "She is morally obligated but because of sister 2 there is no other way that they could practically split it because sister 2 will eventually find out and will very likely want her 1/3. And if they don\u2019t tell sister2 and try to keep their mothers wishes then a lawsuit could be at hand by sister 2", "MIGHT. You\u2019re making a whole lot of assumptions and excuses. It sounds like Op was paying for the bill of everything regarding their mother. And again, it doesn\u2019t make what I said any less valid. The sister shouldn\u2019t be expecting Op to continue to pay, when she quite literally gets nothing. She wants Op to pay the mortgage on the house indefinitely, but she also wants Op to give up her share. How does that sound even remotely okay to any of you. Sister should stick to Op\u2019s plan, and take the six months to save her money, and figure out her shit. It\u2019s not Op\u2019s responsibility to keep sister1 a float all her damn life", "She\u2019s a better woman than me, cause the moment I saw that I got nothing, I\u2019d stop paying. Also, if the mother wanted her wishes to be fulfilled, she should\u2019ve gotten everything legally notarized and filed. She didn\u2019t, and now here we are. \n\nOp probably paid, because given the sisters attitude, it\u2019s probably normal for Op to pay for everything and put in the work, but get nothing. The mom should\u2019ve at least given op something more than 10%. What a huge slap in the face"]}
