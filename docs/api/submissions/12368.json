{"id": 12368, "submission_id": "11s3lnd", "title": "AITA for forcing my younger sister to sell our family home after our mom died", "selftext": "So. My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.\n\nThere's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2. And my mother did not get the will witnessed or notarized which in Florida is needed to uphold a will.\n\nSister1 has been living in this house for about 10 years now. But every lawyer we've talked to has said that it doesn't matter the house will be split three ways by a judge. \n\nSister1 wants to keep the house, even though she can't afford the mortgage. And technically she can't even keep it since it belongs to all 3 of us. She's saying I'm an asshole because I'm not giving up my third of the house to her like our mom wanted. AND for not helping her pay the mortgage she can't afford. She's refusing to start any of the process needed to put the house under the three siblings names and sell it. So we can try to sell it.\n\nIf we don't sell it, and she misses any of the mortgage payments the house could be lost and then no one gets anything. I offered to help with the mortgage for 6 months to hopefully sell the house in that time. But she's still saying I'm not doing enough to help her keep the house and should be helping for longer while she continues to drag her feet and prolonged having to split the house three ways.\n\nNext week I'm going to go above her and start the process myself since technically any of the three of us can do it. She hasn't even told Sister2 that she has a claim to the house. She's been trying to find loopholes to cut her off since she was estranged from us. But sorry. Legally she has a right to a third of the house. She also wants us to buy her out, but I don't have that kind of money and I have no problem with the house being split.\n\nI dont understand why I should be expected to give up my legal right to a third, and help her pay the mortgage.\n\nEDIT: Seems like a 30/70 in favor of being the asshole. I'll say this, both Sister1 and I have helped our mom financially and medically. When I came back and it looked like it was turning bad. I had already assumed my mom had left the house to Sister1. And while I get the emotional part of this, every lawyer Sister1 and I have talked to say that Sister2 is getting a third. I refuse to have Sister2 take a third, while Sister1 takes her third and mine while I get nothing.

You have time to sort things out. Frankly, your mom died 1 week ago, so you're being really presumptuous about ALL of this. Worry about what happens with the house once whatever happens with your mother's estate, and the validity of the will, has been settled.\n\n>But she's still saying I'm not doing enough to help her keep the house and should be helping for longer while she continues to drag her feet and prolonged having to split the house three ways.\n\nIt's been ONE WEEK.

Assisted living for my mom was around $6,500 per month to start (Alzheimer's) and went upwards of $13,000 in the last half-year.) How often did you help out with some of the heavier caregiving duties? I can tell you that if it was something like Alzheimer's, a stroke, or cancer, it's mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting. Plus, most family caregivers are unpaid, so that 10 years of lost income, retirement savings, and a social life is detrimental.

The intent was for your mother to give her the house; not give her a place to live while you pay for it. \n\nThat being said, your mother's wishes were clearly for your sister to have the full home. The only reason you currently own 1/3 off the property is that your mother didn't have someone attest the will.

More concerned about your inheritance than grieving, I can kind of guess why you weren't supposed to get much.\n\nYTA infinitely here. Sister 1 is slightly an AH but only for asking you to help with the mortgage and estranged sister isn't an AH at all since she isn't involved in anyway yet.\n\nEdit to add that selling the house is the only practical option unless the sister can find a way to afford the mortgage but regardless you're still the AH for wanting more of the equity than intended.

Based on the comments that you have made so far and have been uncovered elsewhere, I can't avoid the impression that some creative storytelling is going on to make you look like you're NTA. Legally, you and the other sister might be entitled to a third each but morally, neither of you are. This is the kind of thing that routinely gets blamed on lawyers but the truth is that your greed and unethical behaviour is driving the decision.", "NAH here. Because grief is very powerful, and your mother has been gone for a week. And while you may be looking ahead to clear the estate, your sister hasn't had time to process everything. Nor, really, have you.\n\nNo decisions need to be made right now. Just focus on getting the documents together for probate, sending out all the copies of the death certificates, and take time for all of you to mourn.\n\nIf you and Sister 3 agree to it, the house doesn't have to be split. For one example, even if there's nothing else in the estate that can equal 2/3 of the value of the home, you can voluntarily renounce your claims. Not saying your family should do this, just that it's an option and there are others. It all comes down to what the three of you can agree on. But if you all fight each other, the house will be sold, the mortgage cleared, and the remaining proceeds split three ways.\n\nProbate for my mom's very simple estate took five months in 2022. You have time to think things through, get free consultations from multiple estate lawyers, and talk to each other.\n\nBut the mortgage does still need to be paid. If there's any cash left in the estate, you can likely pay it out of that as the mortgage is still in your mom's name and the debt currently belongs to the estate. But if Sister 1 does inherit the house, she has to come to grips with the fact that she also inherits the mortgage and the sole responsibility to pay it. But today is not the best day for that intervention.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. My best advice is to just try to give everyone some grace. You, your mom, and your sisters.", "You greedy arsehole.

She allowed your sister to make that her home and left [90%] to your sister. I obviously don\u2019t know your family. Maybe that was wildly unfair. Maybe there is more to the story. But the facts you presented make you clearly the asshole for deliberately going against your moms wishes for your own benefit.", ">My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me.\n\nShe put it in writing. 10%", "What was said is that if the house is sold 90% go to sister one and 10% got to her. \n\nESH. As far as I can tell because to uphold her moms wishes would be to sell the house and have the 90% go to sister 1 and 10% to her. The thing is if sister 1 could afford the house then she can stay in it as long as she wants but she clearly can\u2019t so the only unassholish thing to do in my mind are sell the house according to how the mom would\u2019ve wanted it", "They all sound terrible. Sister 1 wants to keep all of the house but thinks OP should pay the mortgage. OP started sniffing around for their share the minute mom went into hospice.", "It continually amazes me how often a death and inheritance turns families on each other. The number of stories from this sub alone about people getting fucking wildly greedy about money they never had before is absolutely nuts.", "My mother's sister's did that to me. I have been low contact with them since.", ">But every lawyer we've talked to \n\nIt's been seven days since the woman died. In those seven days, she has contacted multiple lawyers, found a loop-hole in the will that she can exploit, and is pressuring her sister to move and put the house up for sale. In the seven days after the mother is dead. The woman isn't even cold in the ground yet. \n\nNot a word of what this woman says about the sister expecting her to pay do i believe. not a single word.", "No one is saying that", "She can absolutely say she isn't paying the mortgage for a house she doesn't own.", "Yeah, people say a lot of things on reddit. What OP is saying is probably accurate, but it will still have to be legally dealt with. And that means there is time before the house can be sold. OP is attempting to force a resolution when it is way too soon to do so. She's gonna have to wait on the property coming out of probate and actually getting split ownership.\n\nIn the mean time, OP doesn't need to pay the mortgage because foreclosure is months away.", "You have to wonder when this new will was written for mom not to get around to 2nd sign", "Fun fact. No they don\u2019t. You can sit in a house for a very long time without paying the mortgage. A lien will eventually be placed which can be settled upon the sale of the house, whenever that may be. Or a new mortgage can be taken to satisfy the lein if there is enough equity in the house", "Didn\u2019t OP mention they\u2019d help out with mortgage for a few months if sister 1 needed?", "No, presently the house is part of the mother's estate which is in probate. They cannot establish ownership until the validity of the will is established (if they are contesting it), and other debt is resolved. Literally, there are MANY steps before the house can potentially be sold.", "I agree\u2014sounds VERY strange\n\nMan deaths and wills and inheritances always bring out the worst in humans, I swear", "It\u2019s been a week. Any reasonable people would sit down, probate the will, and decide how to move forward. There is no need to take action unilaterally after a week. \n\nWe don\u2019t know the equity in the house, or the ages. We don\u2019t know other assets involved. There are so many questions to answer and none of them lead to OP acting unilaterally.\n\nOP also specifically said why should they forfeit their legal right to a third when mom willed them 10%. They know full well what their mothers wishes were, and want to circumvent that. Asshole move\n\nYou\u2019re talking about logic but don\u2019t have any facts of the case. Sister has this house as their primary residence. There\u2019s virtually no way to force her to sell and there\u2019s no one to evict her. There is nothing \u201clogical\u201d about you jumping to conclusions about the case.\n\nThis is very simple. OP is an asshole because they know what their mothers wishes were and are not honoring them. They are working to make try and get their sister out of her home to squeeze out extra money for themselves. That\u2019s an asshole move, no further logic required.\n\nI\u2019m using strong language because I truly hope OP sees it and reconsiders their horrible actions. No shit it\u2019s not bringing my parents back", "Ah, okay, yeah. I misunderstood what OP said, and thought sister 1 wanted OPs 10%.", "I\u2019d take what OP very lossely referred to as sister not doing enough to help her keep the house with a massive grain of salt. OP didn\u2019t even say sister was asking OP to pay the mortgage in the original post", "sister 1 was most likely he one taking care of the mother. that's why the mother wants the sister to have most of the house", "Agreed, and if you look at her post history, she was posting about it the day her mom was dying, but not yet dead.", "Whereupon everyone loses the house, sister 1 gets nothing *and* has no place to live.\n\nEveryone's painting OP with a pretty broad brush and isn't taking reality into account.", "I live in Florida and had to deal with my mother's estate under these rules.  OP is correct--the will is not valid.", "Is this a second will?", "Okay I stand corrected. However, Ops option of paying the mortgage for six months and then selling it, and splitting the proceeds is probably the best way to go about it. Even *if* op gives up her third, the estranged sister STILL has a right to her inheritance. I mean that\u2019s quite literally what every lawyer has told them. Idk what the sister wants Op to do. Also, it\u2019s not Op\u2019s responsibility to pay her sister\u2019s mortgage so she continue to live in a house that they\u2019re more than likely gonna sell, and that she can\u2019t afford", "She also in her comment history was posting on the day the mom died, en route to hospice and trying to figure out how to cash out on this house. The OP is a gross human.", "That's fine. That doesn't mean the house is partly OP's to sell.", "My whole takeaway is that OP is moving much too fast to try to resolve things. The mother may have debts that mean there isn't a house to will to anyone or split between the siblings. This is very much a \"one thing at a time\" situation. \n\nAnd paying the mortgage right now is not the highest priority because it will take months for foreclosure proceedings. The right move right now would be to contact the mortgage lender about the situation and figure out the will ASAP. And since OP is consulting lawyers, consult a lawyer about how to handle the mortgage when the inheritance of the house is in question.", "Definitely seems to be the case, yep", "It will be.", "Again, only if the house makes it out of probate and isn't required to pay other debt."]}
