{"id": 12368, "submission_id": "11s3lnd", "title": "AITA for forcing my younger sister to sell our family home after our mom died", "selftext": "So. My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.\n\nThere's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2. And my mother did not get the will witnessed or notarized which in Florida is needed to uphold a will.\n\nSister1 has been living in this house for about 10 years now. But every lawyer we've talked to has said that it doesn't matter the house will be split three ways by a judge. \n\nSister1 wants to keep the house, even though she can't afford the mortgage. And technically she can't even keep it since it belongs to all 3 of us. She's saying I'm an asshole because I'm not giving up my third of the house to her like our mom wanted. AND for not helping her pay the mortgage she can't afford. She's refusing to start any of the process needed to put the house under the three siblings names and sell it. So we can try to sell it.\n\nIf we don't sell it, and she misses any of the mortgage payments the house could be lost and then no one gets anything. I offered to help with the mortgage for 6 months to hopefully sell the house in that time. But she's still saying I'm not doing enough to help her keep the house and should be helping for longer while she continues to drag her feet and prolonged having to split the house three ways.\n\nNext week I'm going to go above her and start the process myself since technically any of the three of us can do it. She hasn't even told Sister2 that she has a claim to the house. She's been trying to find loopholes to cut her off since she was estranged from us. But sorry. Legally she has a right to a third of the house. She also wants us to buy her out, but I don't have that kind of money and I have no problem with the house being split.\n\nI dont understand why I should be expected to give up my legal right to a third, and help her pay the mortgage.\n\nEDIT: Seems like a 30/70 in favor of being the asshole. I'll say this, both Sister1 and I have helped our mom financially and medically. When I came back and it looked like it was turning bad. I had already assumed my mom had left the house to Sister1. And while I get the emotional part of this, every lawyer Sister1 and I have talked to say that Sister2 is getting a third. I refuse to have Sister2 take a third, while Sister1 takes her third and mine while I get nothing. But thanks for the comments and takes\n\nEDIT2: Ppl keep asking about the 90% and 10%. Sister1 is 30, but she lived at home for 10 years with no real bills. She did this straight out of college not because our mom needed any type of care. She only paid $150 in rent for those 10 years, and wasn't even working full time. I do understand why my mom would have wanted her to have the largest share since from her POV Sister1 has no income or honestly anything else. And sister2 getting nothing also make sense as her fallout with our mom was very big. But both Sister1 and I helped with mom's bills and medical care when needed. I even paid for my mom's life insurance for about 2 years. \n\nIt's really Sister1's denial that unless I help with the mortgage she's losing the house that's getting me. Sister2 is getting her third whether we like it or not. Sister1 is not going to be able to keep the house. Her dragging her feet is going to cost me money, not from the house, but because I'm going to have to pay for this mortgage to make sure we dont lose the house before its sold. And even if I do that, Im expected to give up my third?", "created_utc": 1678902375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s3lnd/aita_for_forcing_my_younger_sister_to_sell_our/", "score": 728, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How often did you help out with some of the heavier caregiving duties? I can tell you that if it was something like Alzheimer's, a stroke, or cancer, it's mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting. Plus, most family caregivers are unpaid, so that 10 years of lost income, retirement savings, and a social life is detrimental.

My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.\n\nThere's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2.

Based on the comments that you have made so far and have been uncovered elsewhere, I can't avoid the impression that some creative storytelling is going on to make you look like you're NTA. Legally, you and the other sister might be entitled to a third each but morally, neither of you are. This is the kind of thing that routinely gets blamed on lawyers but the truth is that your greed and unethical behaviour is driving the decision.", "NAH here. Because grief is very powerful, and your mother has been gone for a week. And while you may be looking ahead to clear the estate, your sister hasn't had time to process everything. Nor, really, have you.\n\nNo decisions need to be made right now. Just focus on getting the documents together for probate, sending out all the copies of the death certificates, and take time for all of you to mourn.\n\nIf you and Sister 3 agree to it, the house doesn't have to be split. For one example, even if there's nothing else in the estate that can equal 2/3 of the value of the home, you can voluntarily renounce your claims. Not saying your family should do this, just that it's an option and there are others. It all comes down to what the three of you can agree on. But if you all fight each other, the house will be sold, the mortgage cleared, and the remaining proceeds split three ways.\n\nProbate for my mom's very simple estate took five months in 2022. You have time to think things through, get free consultations from multiple estate lawyers, and talk to each other.\n\nBut the mortgage does still need to be paid. If there's any cash left in the estate, you can likely pay it out of that as the mortgage is still in your mom's name and the debt currently belongs to the estate. But if Sister 1 does inherit the house, she has to come to grips with the fact that she also inherits the mortgage and the sole responsibility to pay it. But today is not the best day for that intervention.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. My best advice is to just try to give everyone some grace. You, your mom, and your sisters.", "You greedy arsehole.

The estate would then be split 50/50 between sister #1 and the estranged sister.\n\nThe only solution to stick to mom's wishes is to have both OP & estranged sister legally decline the inheritance but somehow have a legal document that states that OP gets 10% if the house is subsequently sold. That takes agreement between all the sisters and at least 1 lawyer.\n\n\nAgain, I don't know where OP lives or any other circumstances here, but it isn't as simple as everyone is making it out.

Sister2 can force us to sell and get her third.\nIt's really Sister1's denial that unless I help with the mortgage she's losing the house that's getting me. Sister2 is getting her third whether we like it or not. Sister1 is not going to be able to keep the house. Her dragging her feet is going to cost me money, not from the house, but because I'm going to have to pay for this mortgage to make sure we dont lose the house before its sold.

There could also be a lien for lawyer fees, credit cards, taxes, health care bills, utilities, etc.  OP keeping 10% (mom's wish) and gifting the difference of the 1/3 to sister 1 fixes nothing. Giving up their entire 1/3 fixes nothing. Who pays sister 2 her share? OP again?

I am with OP", "most life insurance policies for older people seem to just cover the funeral costs", "Maybe it was a smaller policy to cover funeral expenses which can easily be $10-$15k . If I were paying it, I would make sure I was the beneficiary", "Plus it sounds like the mother had been sick. She saw the red flags", "There are 2 ways this can go: everyone sees reality, accepts the inevitability of the sale and 3 way split and gets on board with figuring out next steps or sister 1 doesn't cooperate and everyone wastes a lot of money on lawyers while the house moves towards getting foreclosed on. \n\nIt's not an emergency to actually sell it. It's an emergency to get the process going and make a plan. Once the split of the house and plan to sell it is clear, it's very easy to contact the bank and avoid a foreclosure or to decide to collectively pay the mortgage until probate authorizes the sale (should be an immediate ok at that point even if the resulting profits are not released until later) and it's actually sold. If the will is being contested and there are no other assets in her estate to use to keep up with payments, then there's nothing to do but watch the train wreck happen and hope for a quick resolution in court before it's all completely lost.", "How so? Most people aren't sick for years and years if they're dying at a relatively young age.", "Yeah I acknowledged that is the case from my Google search. \n\nThe estate is what it is, given there is a house the estate will go to probate, OP pays the mortgage they can file a claim against the estate for those funds, when the house is sold OP is entitled to what was paid towards the mortgage as well as whatever they are entitled to from a intestate estate. Estate won't be divided until all debts are paid and OP filing a claim for the mortgage is a valid debt of the estate. \n\nHowever, it seems really cold hearted to kick the sister out and believe all this is settled before death certificates are even issued and a week after death. I had a relative I didn't even like I handled probate for and waited longer than a week.", "NAH - OP, sorry for your loss. Serious illness and death are really difficult. It sounds like there wasn\u2019t much communication about what would happen if mom died. As devastating as terminal illness/ death is, legal proceedings can happen quickly and it\u2019s not wrong for OP to try to figure out what\u2019s going on and what the outcomes could be. It sounds like state laws will supersede mom\u2019s wishes and put the estate into probate. \n\nSummary from OP post and comments: \n\nSister 1 - made the post with OP. Is the sole recipient of mom\u2019s life insurance. Moved in with mom 10 yrs ago was only paying $150/mo in rent and working part time. Sounds like this went on for years before mom got sick. Paid for some of mom\u2019s medication. Cannot afford the mortgage without OP\u2019s help.\n\nSister 2 - had a falling out with family due to drug use. Last heard of was in a women\u2019s shelter. \n\nOP - IMO seems to be the only one that is looking at the bigger picture of laws, medical debts, and the estate. Made a post in r/legaladvice when mom went into hospice. Helped to to pay for mom\u2019s medication. \n\nEveryone, please consider completing a will, end of life care plan (advance directives), and power of attorney and medical power of attorney to avoid situations like this.  Yes - even if you\u2019re only in your 20\u2019s. Accidents, illness, and disability happen unexpectedly. Talk to your parents/family and encourage them to do the same.", "NTA - Not that I understand everything but all seems very unfair. Your S 1 wants the house and for you to pay the mortgage erm anyone else think that's odd. So you get no inheritance what so ever and your sister gets a whole house and more handouts from you", "Lol, freaking asshole. YTA\n\n\nHow's them $$ eyes. Too bright? Keeps making you forget what your parent wanted?", "NTA your sister had time to work and save and chose not to all while staying at your mothers home for 150.00 a month. If I were you I would make sure IF you pay the mortgage that you will be paid back for it prior to the house profits being divvied out. You should not lose your share due to your sister\u2019s inability to save.", "NTA\nFirst of all if the will is not signed by the notary how the hell one would know that this was actually the mother's wish and not the smaller sister pushing her to write or even writing herself? Honestly I am sure that if mother wanted to give the house to the smaller sister she would have done it normally and legally on paper and if it's not done then the house should be split between all 3 children equally. I guess one third will still be a decent amount considering the mortgage is so high that the smaller sister can not afford paying. And why would OP just pay a mortgage from a house which does not and never will belong to her? I think sister's request is ridiculous and all sisters should mourn their mother and after that just sell and split the house equally and keep good relationships.", "NTA, If she can't afford the mortgage then the house needs selling\n\nAccording to your mum's will you are entitled to a percentage of that anyway\n\nCould you not take the 10% you were originally meant to get, give 1/3 to estranged sister and let sis 1 have the rest?\n\nAlthough if it's true that sis 1 has basically been getting handouts from mum without giving any other form of support I understand why this annoys you", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated situation. I\u2019d suggest talk to mediator/consult to layout the facts for sister 1.\n\n- if she wants her 90% claim, she has to fight for it in court and likely will lose the court claim and any extra share of inheritance. Also incurring cost for the legal fees.\n\n- if she wants your help - she has to split 3 ways and go from there. Her share may help her out a down payment on an affordable space etc.\n\nI commend you for including sister2, because now your mom is gone - what you do next speaks to who you three are as sisters. We had a rough end with my parent before they passed, we siblings decided that died with them and stuck together. Shared the inheritance together etc.\n\nInstead of looking at this from the individual perspectives. Look at the facts, you all are better off burying the hatchet and splitting this and helping each other REALISTICALLy.\n\nI do feel sad reading this is where your minds are when your mom is not even cold (so to speak). Sorry for your loss, and all the best with this. Hope you have time to grieve, all of you.", "I dunno. I\u2019m certainly NOT paying anyone else\u2019s mortgage, so the only way to move forward is obviously to sell. The trouble I have is with the split\u2026and every bit of OP\u2019s behavior. \n\nOthers pointed out OP had reached out to Reddit legal advice about this the very day mom went into hospice. (Post now deleted. Figures.) Coulda likely done the right thing and rectified the problem from the outset had they not been a money grubbing shite.\n\nAt this point, the only non-AH move is to simply do what mom wanted as best possible now. (OP already fucked Sis1 out of the 30% that HAS to go to Sis2 b/c they didn\u2019t flag the issue). That is, sell the house, divide the mortgage payments fronted to do so, and take the TEN percent, knowing 30% goes to Sis2 and the rest to Sis1. \u2026And hope Sis1 either never learns they\u2019re such a greedy fuckstick.", "her now deleted post history.  she's been doing work on this since the literal day mom went to hospice.", "But that's normal?  You can't wait until someone passes to arrange their affairs.  Unless mother's condition was so bad that she was incompetent in hospice, I am surprised they didn't get the will notarized in that time as required.", "Fair points but I'd say the fact that it's been a week and OP is already harping on about her sister dragging her feet on the sale is everything. Maybe OP's sisters need more than a week to hop onto the estate. \n\nSister 2 may or may not know - OP is assuming she doesn't know about the will issue. Sister 2 lost a mother she was estranged from for years...she probably has other feelings to deal with this week. \n\nOP is the AH because she has already gotten legal advice and wants to take steps to sell the house ALL IN A WEEK...that's why she is the AH. \n\nAnd she hasn't said if anyone official has actually declared the will invalid...she just decided it is.", "YTA you have it in writing what your mother wanted regardless of if it was done corrctly.", "With the explanation, NTA.   \nyou are in your right to not get fucked over by your sister or you mom. you sister is being greedy en selfish. your mother sadly messed up the will. (its basic knowledge to me you need it notarized, just writing on paper isn't a thing)   \n\n\nmy suggestion. sell the house to your sister (if she can even afford it) cheap ish. clean out the morgage and split whats left between the three. She can use that money for a new mortgage if she so wants, and the other 2 don't get shafted like the monter wanted to.   \n\n\nthis would be the most fair option in my eyes.   \n\n\nAlso, where i'm from, its impossible to completely leave out your kid in a will. they will always get 50%. so in this case, sister 1 would get 50%+16.66% and the other 2  get 16.66% of the house. if she got it notarized. (assuming they are her birth children)", "Hey OP\n\nInfo, who was paying the mortgage before?\n\n7 days isn\u2019t long enough to fall behind on mortgage payments, like your painting your sister to have done in your post.\n\nIs your sister is only demanding you contribute to mortgage BECAUSE you refuses to surrender your illegitimate 3rd, which is fair actually.\n\nWhy should Sister1 pay 100% of the mortgage on a house she only has 1/3 claim to?\n\nDid she Really, actually, black and white say \u2018I Keep all of house AND you pay\u2019?", "Simple solution seeing as you are not happy with others benefitting. Let her default on the mortgage and then no one gets anything. You were not owed anything as per your mothers wishes (that you are completely disregarding)  only in the event that she sold.", "NTA - this happens frequently when one sibling has gotten their feet under the table.  Other siblings go away, build a life but this person hangs on, pressuring the parent  to put the house into their name 'otherwise they will be homeless'. \n\nTell Sister 1 that if she doesn't play ball with the rest of you \n\n(1) she is liable for all the excess legal costs and they will come out of her share.  If you have to get a court order, rather than her signature, then she will pay those legal costs.  \n\n(2) any loss in value because of the delays caused by her will also come out of her share.  \n\nShe thinks she can wait you all out and you will surrender, like your mother but if she realizes that she will get LESS than the 2 of you, she'll act in her own best interest.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m not agreeing with OP or disagreeing with you. But I think we also need to look at the fact that sister 1 expects OP to pay the mortgage. Why should OP pay the mortgage if sister 1 is benefitting 100% from this. And it seems like OP also paid for the life insurance.", "But she \u2018OnLy WoRkEd PaRt TiMe\u2019 \u2026 like there\u2019d even be any house now had the sister not stayed and been a carer, it would have been sold years ago and all money spent on the mothers care had the sister left.\n\nOPs ta for sure", "According to the post the sister was neither the caretaker nor did she pay the mortgage... so how is this the top comment?!?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

This whole life insurance thing is annoying me, OP wasn't in the picture for a while for whatever reason hence where she says \"when i came back'. She also stated she only paid the Life insurance for 2 years, it's not a long time or large amount. Seems like she was out the picture for a while then came back and paid the Life insurance for 2 years, lol that seems like an investment not doing something benevolent.", "It also smack of OP being dishonest about how in need or desperate the sister actually is about the mortgage.\n\nIf mums been dead leads than a month, why are mortgage payments so pressing? Has sister been paying the mortgage this whole time?", "7 days also isn\u2019t long enough to fall behind on mortgage.\n\nOP seems dishonest as hell, what\u2019s the bet the sister is only demanding OP contribute to mortgage if she refuses to surrender their 3rd, which is fair actually.\n\nWhy should Sister1 pay 100% of the mortgage on a house she only has 1/3 claim to?\n\nI doubt it was \u2018I Keep all of house AND you pay\u2019\n\nHow was the mortgage getting paid before?", "That\u2019s typically the opposite."]}
