You don't know this man. Why in the world would he think you would be comfortable with a total stranger having a key to the house you were staying in?

You asked the homeowner if you could give the spare key to your brother for backup and they agreed, so the neighbor was boorish to confront you about it. Frankly, his insensitivity has just proven why your decision was preferable.", "NTA! His response is concerning and even more reason to feel the way you do. A reasonable person wouldn\u2019t take it as a moral failing on his part because you hardly know him. His reaction is over the top.", "NTA,\n\nAnd the reaction of the neighbor kind of proves your point. You just gave the key to family member, this is more reliable and easier for you, which is understandable.", "NTA: Just the fact that this guy felt this strongly about having the key makes me think he absolutely should not have it.\n\nAt best he's a very odd guy.", "NTA\n\nyour safety concerns first.", "NTA.  I've never really thought about who all had keys if I'm staying away from home, but now I sure will.", "NTA. Let him be offended. Don't lose any sleep over this.", "NTA. Even if the neighbor\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t immediately validate your safety concerns about a stranger having access to the home you are watching (which are sufficient and perfectly legitimate), it is simply more practical for the spare key to be with someone you can reach easily and comfortably. The neighbor has no right to the spare key, and unless you\u2019ve ever had an interaction with him before, his response to the pretty typical concerns of a woman staying by herself in a strange place was way way over the top. Even if you had interacted before, my guess is his behavior justified asking for the key back.\n\nHe can whine like a wind up radio from the days of yore but sadly it\u2019s not outrageous for a woman to have to be concerned about her physical safety. There wouldn\u2019t be so much material for true crime shows and podcasts otherwise.", "NTA and his response is kind of concerning", "NTA his complaining at you about the situation kinda proves your point", "I've got a key to my neighbor's house. I've had it for about a decade. I feed their cats when they go away for the weekend, and one time the neighbor accidentally locked herself out, and used my key to get back in. \n\nIn my experience, that's a pretty normal relationship. \n\nBut that's apparently not what was going on here. The owner asked OP to house sit for a month, and then and only then chose to give a copy of the key to his neighbor. That's a bit weird.\n\nI do feel obliged to point out, however, that if you have ever stayed in a hotel, or rented a flat or apartment, or a student dorm, or anything of that nature, then any number of people you don't know have theoretically had free access to the space that you are in.

I've been doing this since I was in my teens. It started with family members or family friends then they started referring me to friends and so on. This specific gig is for the coworker of a family member. I am paid and I'm not exactly sure what you mean by how they work; I meet with the home owner a few times before they leave, we go over everything they expect to be done while away, if they have any pets I get all their care instructions and emergency info, I look after plants, I collect mail, and I just stay in the house until they come back.
