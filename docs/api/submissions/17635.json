You need to book place on an ice breaker months in advance.", "NTA \n\nAs an immigrant from one continent to another and having traveled to see family while broke:\n\nBe very, very careful. Especially when people have no or little money, they tend to not get travel insurance, or insufficient travel insurance. It's not just the actual trip you need to finance, but especially when in financial dire straits, you need to consider what happens if you get into an accident or trouble of whatever kind when you are there. Could you easily travel back home, or would you be stuck on a different continent without money, deal with whatever problem you are having, potentially need uninsurable care or legal help or translators, miss out on the income you would earn if you'd stay home and go to work, and dealing with airline companies who might or might not be able to help with getting you home when and how you need to? All these things are a massive headache for people with 'enough' money, but can land you in serious problems if you have none to start with. \n\nI find that a lot of people coming from wealthier countries with good laws to protect human rights just don't think of this till it's too late. It's what you say; when people never experienced real hardship, it is easy for them (and typically by extention their friends and family with similar experiences) to Pollyanna the living daylight out of the problems people face when they have no money. \n\nAnd then shame people less fortunate for not trying hard enough. It's not a matter of 'trying' for you. You clearly really want to! It's a question of financial survival. Depending on how comfortable you are with asking for help from your sister or parents, you could see if they can gift you money for paying the entire trip for you (but beware that people sometimes use this  to shame or manipulate even the people they really love if they get angry or stressed themselves for years after the fact...not saying your family would ofcourse, but its something to think of before asking for $help). \n\nThe way your post reads, is that you have already decided not to go but need a little bit of 'permission' from impartial internet strangers to feel morally justified to not destroy your finances after just getting back on track. Choosing to make sure you and your husband are safe is absolutely okay, but explain to your sister very clearly why, and as soon as possible. If you have a hard time explaining it to her in person, call her at a moment you feel confident. If you know that won't go to well either, you could draft a very kindly worded letter/email that explains exactly what your situation is. I would explain as clearly as possible what your financial situation is like to the extend that you are comfortable with, because a lot of people do use 'I am broke' as an excuse to get out of things while they really do have the money, but it is the only way they feel they can get out of commitments or obligations. Not sure if you have this type of money culture around you, or it's the opposite and using money worries as a reason to do/do not do things is seen as shameful, but don't let cultural expectations about how to deal with money create misunderstandings between you and your sister if a frank conversation could damage your friendship. And tell her sooner rather then later if you don't go. \n\nGood luck!", "I agree with you that no one should expect financial sacrifices to attend a wedding with so little notice. My sister is one of the luckiest people I know. Life has just worked out for her, no matter how difficult the odds. I don\u2019t think she has ever experienced anything like this. She will at some point, but until she lives it herself, I don\u2019t think she can really understand how hard this is for me and my spouse.

It\u2019s just hard when it\u2019s not only your sister, but your best friend. When I put that aside and ask if I would ask her the same, I know I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t ask anybody to go into the red on my behalf for something in my life.", "I\u2019ve cycled from angry to sad to dumbfounded to angry again. For a little context, I got married last year to my now husband after being with him for 4.5yrs. We were engaged for 2.5yrs. No one was surprised when we got engaged. We wanted a destination wedding, and planned one that was frankly pretty dang inexpensive for our family and friends. We asked our closest family and friends immediately after getting engaged if it was something they could do with 2yrs notice. Most said yes, and that they would consider it as a great vacation. The grand total per couple for 5 days including flights, hotel, and food (it was all-inclusive) was $1200. When looking at the few who said they couldn\u2019t, we changed the plan to keep it local so they could attend. We paid for our wedding ourselves. It frankly would have been so much more affordable for us to do a destination, but family is the most important thing to us. \n\nWe quite literally changed our whole plan to have those closest to us able to attend. That\u2019s just who my spouse and I are. We prioritize family above all else. The other surprise financial difficulties since then, we have taken in stride. \n\nNow, to add salt to the wound of the short notice of my sister getting married in a foreign country, her wedding date is LITERALLY 1 day before my first wedding anniversary. I know she did this because she thought it would be fun to take couples anniversary trips together (she told me this and she\u2019s an absolute Pollyanna. As a big sister, I think it\u2019s sweet). I know for sure my spouse and I can\u2019t both afford to attend, and if that\u2019s the case, we will be apart on our first wedding anniversary. That might sound cheesy, but I would really like to celebrate my first wedding anniversary with my hubs in person and not over a phone call.", "I agree with everything you said. I just never imagined I would watch my sister get married in a FaceTime call, and I also literally changed my wedding plans to make it more accessible to our friends and family. I just can\u2019t fathom asking someone to pay a ton, let alone in this short amount of time. \n\nMany have responded that IWBA, and I\u2019m thankful for that objective perspective (sincerely thankful), but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the situation stinks and it still genuinely hurts.", "I completely agree with you!
