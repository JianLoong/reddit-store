You need to book place on an ice breaker months in advance.", "NTA \n\nAs an immigrant from one continent to another and having traveled to see family while broke:\n\nBe very, very careful. Especially when people have no or little money, they tend to not get travel insurance, or insufficient travel insurance. It's not just the actual trip you need to finance, but especially when in financial dire straits, you need to consider what happens if you get into an accident or trouble of whatever kind when you are there. Could you easily travel back home, or would you be stuck on a different continent without money, deal with whatever problem you are having, potentially need uninsurable care or legal help or translators, miss out on the income you would earn if you'd stay home and go to work, and dealing with airline companies who might or might not be able to help with getting you home when and how you need to? All these things are a massive headache for people with 'enough' money, but can land you in serious problems if you have none to start with. \n\nI find that a lot of people coming from wealthier countries with good laws to protect human rights just don't think of this till it's too late. It's what you say; when people never experienced real hardship, it is easy for them (and typically by extention their friends and family with similar experiences) to Pollyanna the living daylight out of the problems people face when they have no money. \n\nAnd then shame people less fortunate for not trying hard enough. It's not a matter of 'trying' for you. You clearly really want to! It's a question of financial survival. Depending on how comfortable you are with asking for help from your sister or parents, you could see if they can gift you money for paying the entire trip for you (but beware that people sometimes use this  to shame or manipulate even the people they really love if they get angry or stressed themselves for years after the fact...not saying your family would ofcourse, but its something to think of before asking for $help). \n\nThe way your post reads, is that you have already decided not to go but need a little bit of 'permission' from impartial internet strangers to feel morally justified to not destroy your finances after just getting back on track. Choosing to make sure you and your husband are safe is absolutely okay, but explain to your sister very clearly why, and as soon as possible. If you have a hard time explaining it to her in person, call her at a moment you feel confident. If you know that won't go to well either, you could draft a very kindly worded letter/email that explains exactly what your situation is. I would explain as clearly as possible what your financial situation is like to the extend that you are comfortable with, because a lot of people do use 'I am broke' as an excuse to get out of things while they really do have the money, but it is the only way they feel they can get out of commitments or obligations. Not sure if you have this type of money culture around you, or it's the opposite and using money worries as a reason to do/do not do things is seen as shameful, but don't let cultural expectations about how to deal with money create misunderstandings between you and your sister if a frank conversation could damage your friendship. And tell her sooner rather then later if you don't go. \n\nGood luck!", "I agree with you that no one should expect financial sacrifices to attend a wedding with so little notice. My sister is one of the luckiest people I know. Life has just worked out for her, no matter how difficult the odds. I don\u2019t think she has ever experienced anything like this.

I wouldn\u2019t ask anybody to go into the red on my behalf for something in my life.", "I\u2019ve cycled from angry to sad to dumbfounded to angry again. For a little context, I got married last year to my now husband after being with him for 4.5yrs. We were engaged for 2.5yrs. No one was surprised when we got engaged. We wanted a destination wedding, and planned one that was frankly pretty dang inexpensive for our family and friends. We asked our closest family and friends immediately after getting engaged if it was something they could do with 2yrs notice. Most said yes, and that they would consider it as a great vacation. The grand total per couple for 5 days including flights, hotel, and food (it was all-inclusive) was $1200. When looking at the few who said they couldn\u2019t, we changed the plan to keep it local so they could attend. We paid for our wedding ourselves. It frankly would have been so much more affordable for us to do a destination, but family is the most important thing to us. \n\nWe quite literally changed our whole plan to have those closest to us able to attend. That\u2019s just who my spouse and I are. We prioritize family above all else. The other surprise financial difficulties since then, we have taken in stride. \n\nNow, to add salt to the wound of the short notice of my sister getting married in a foreign country, her wedding date is LITERALLY 1 day before my first wedding anniversary. I know she did this because she thought it would be fun to take couples anniversary trips together (she told me this and she\u2019s an absolute Pollyanna. As a big sister, I think it\u2019s sweet). I know for sure my spouse and I can\u2019t both afford to attend, and if that\u2019s the case, we will be apart on our first wedding anniversary. That might sound cheesy, but I would really like to celebrate my first wedding anniversary with my hubs in person and not over a phone call.", "I agree with everything you said. I just never imagined I would watch my sister get married in a FaceTime call, and I also literally changed my wedding plans to make it more accessible to our friends and family.

Send them a nice gift along with your regrets.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nDon't go. Instead, write a letter to your sister telli9ng her what you just told us about how happy you are for her. \n\nAnd tell her that you unfortunately can't make it. Don't bring up the cost again; she already knows. And her airy reply displayed absolutely no concern for the hardship it would bring you.\n\nHonestly, people can be so controlling and ugly about attendance at their weddings. It reminds us that, in college, only the boring teachers took attendance. They were so terrible they had to MAKE you come.\n\nThe world did not revolve around their classes, and the world does not revolve around this wedding.", "NTA \n\nYou need to step down as MOH. No one, not even bride and groom, should go into debt over a wedding!", "NTA.  Do not financially ruin yourself for a wedding. Dont take out a loan or borrow money. Dont feel guilty. She is making a rushed decision and she will have to deal with the consequences of people not being able to make it there. Focus on yourself and your husband and wish your sister well.", "NTA. You do have to live your life.", "I completely agree. I\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time and energy prioritizing my needs and my family\u2019s needs (me and the hubs) as opposed to my sister and parents. It was hard initially, but has absolutely been the right thing to do. This is the first time a huge life event has come up that I would previously have gone way past above and beyond to make work. Granted, I\u2019m still trying my best to be there, but I\u2019m not willing to financially cripple myself to do it. It\u2019s the right thing to do, but I\u2019m still sad. It\u2019s a hard thing to do all the way around.", "Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. You absolutely hit the nail on the head. \n\nHaving travelled a good amount myself, I always think of the possibilities of something found awry and not being able to get home. \n\nI love my sister so much. She has dedicated her life to serving others around the world. She has blind faith that it will work out. So far, and against all conventional odds, it has worked out for her. \n\nMy immediate relatives aren\u2019t wealthy, so asking for help there isn\u2019t an option. And realistically, even if the help were available, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that action of \u201ckindness\u201d came up again and again in the future. \n\nI\u2019m 99% certain we aren\u2019t going. That remaining 1% feels so terrible to not go to the wedding. Myself and people closest in my life are so in it that we can\u2019t zoom out far enough to be impartial. The points of view from you and the others who have commented, who are objectively not apart of the situation, have helped me know that my responsible choice to not attend is the right one. Sincerely, thank you again for your kind words and understanding.", "I agree with you 100% \ud83c\udfc6", "Talking to her fianc\u00e9 is something my husband and I have been talking about. As much as I would like them to change the timeline so we have a chance of being there, more than that, I want her to be happy and have the wedding she wants.", "I agreed prior to her choosing an international destination. She made that choice after asking me. The international destination came as quite a surprise to myself as well as the other bridesmaids.", "NTA. OP, I am going to state something that you may find offensive, so I apologize in advance.\n\nYou may view your sister as your best friend but her actions show that you are not hers.\n\nThe very idea that she expects you to all but ruin your financial future to attend her last minute wedding is insane. She obviously knows that you really can\u2019t afford it. But still putting pressure onto you to attend? That is an AH move, it\u2019s self absorbed, and inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, you mentioned a few other things about your sister that you believe are about her wanting to be close to you (her wedding date, for instance) and that\u2019s not what I am getting.\n\nTo me, it seems like your sister is locked into some sort of competition with you that you don\u2019t even know about. You get married, so she finds some random dude to marry and \u2018he\u2019s so wonderful\u2019? When you don\u2019t really know him, for real? People send the representative at the start of any relationship, that\u2019s not who he really is. \n\nThen the wedding is scheduled the day before your first anniversary? She says because she\u2019s wanting to take couples trips at your mutual anniversaries. No, I just can\u2019t buy that. A person who\u2019s so inconsiderate to your financial situation doesn\u2019t seem like the type of person that would want to share the spotlight for their wedding. Knowing that if you finagle a way to be at her wedding, you can\u2019t afford for your husband to attend? Your first wedding anniversary would be spent apart and that doesn\u2019t seem to bother your so-called loving sister? \n\nListen, you don\u2019t have to believe a word I\u2019ve said but your posts seem almost anxious in tone about not wanting to disappoint or hurt her when she doesn\u2019t seem to have the same level of concern. When you married your husband, you committed to making the family you have with him your first priority. Destroying your joint future to appease your sister is not committing to him. You need boundaries with baby sister and you really need to think about whether she really has your back or whether she\u2019s been actively stabbing you in the back. I can almost guess that you moved your destination wedding in order to appease her as the primary reason. You need to think about what your relationship with your sister has really been like.", "to be perfectly frank, your sister doesn't sound like a sweet Pollyanna.\n\nshe sounds like a sheltered, self centered, empty headed person who is so used to the warm support of a family that will do everything for her. it's insane that she thinks this is feasible for anybody, so the only other answer is that she *isn't* thinking of anyone but herself - and certainly not you.", "Hugs for you op and I hope things turn around for you soon", "I really feel for you and your sister....I read some of your replies and realized she is moving to an other country to be with her husband as well. I moved, then married someone from my new country, then got citizenship here and don't plan to ever move back. The sheer amount of aggression from people was insane. I have a better life here then I would have in my native country, but life there was good too. Either way, each time I made a decision that further solidified my life away from my country of birth, some family or friends would take it personally and dissapear from my life. My grandmother actually said she'd die the moment after my move out of spite. She actually did 2 months later too...as did my grandfather 2 weeks after my grandmother. \n\nThere might be additional stress on your sister because at the moment where she feels that you coming to her wedding in the country she will be living, means that you will still be her best friend, and love her and support her decisions and maintain the closeness you two always had despite being on a different continent. You not coming to the wedding might be something that is irrationally freaking her out because other people are pulling away from her? You mentioning in another reply that she said she won't be back anytime soon due to the cost of airtravel, really made me think about my own experiences and how marrying AND then moving to another country are an insanely stressful mix. Can make awesome people get so stressed they can become a little bit unreasonable for a while with what they hope for or expect from the people they love, same goes for the people left behind. Anyway, your sister sounds like a truely wonderful person who in the grand scheme of things, and with some time and you continuing to reach out, will likely understand that intercontinental travel is often prohibitively expensive. \n\nAnd women moving to another country to be with their husband at an seriously increased risk of (domestic) abuse and just general discrimination because they don't have a support network...your sister might not be worried about abuse or discrimination per se, but the reality of being really vulnerable as an immigrant woman is maybe on her mind as well? So while you can't be there for her in person, you can't really go wrong with reassuring her that you will always be a phonecall or email away. I call my sibling for hours at a time through Signal. Free videochatting as much as we want, sometimes in the middle of the night due to timedifferences but hey; we talk a lot this way. And telling her that you are saving up money to see her when you can, can put her mind somewhat to ease as well, and alleviate your own stress and disappointment. Having some sort of realistic plan to see her that you are willing and able to carry through with, even if it takes a while to get the money saved up for, might soften the blow that you are not coming... I realize my reply here is a bit beyond your AITA question. And maybe none of the stuff I wrote based on my own experiences applies to you and your sister. But please don't be to hard on yourself; this is an unfortunate situation with a bunch of complicating factors.", "Then NTA if you don't attend. However, you would be TA if you guilt trip her about her wedding decisions. You don't have to go. But she is allowed to have the wedding she wants. \nAre your parents contributing financially? Can they pay for you to go?", "I completely understand why she comes across that way in this post. I can\u2019t break down a few decades of life with her in a post. She\u2019s the most strong-willed, determined, and loving person I know. She\u2019s lived around the world helping those who are struggling and impoverished. She\u2019s learned new languages to reach more people. She has the bravery and boldness to do this because she was raised by people who loved her and told her she could do anything. I sacrificed so much of my own life to protect that magic in her. That didn\u2019t detract from my life. I feel like it was a purpose of my life that also made me a better person along the way.\n\nShe isn\u2019t empty-headed or sheltered. She is sometimes self-centered, but not in a malicious way, just a naive one. Knowing her, this decision isn\u2019t a lack of thinking of others, it\u2019s a byproduct of her life working out miraculously well up to this point. She can\u2019t understand what she hasn\u2019t lived. Maybe she just has the best karma ever. \n\nI agree, she should be thinking from the perspective of her friends and family that cannot financially make this happen. \n\nShe\u2019s a good person, even if in this moment, she\u2019s being a bit shortsighted.", "We never know the future. If only I had a crystal ball and could see what\u2019s ahead! \n\nThank you for your well wishes. They\u2019re sincerely appreciated. \ud83e\udd0d", "I agree I would be TA if I guilted her, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m remaining as objective and factual as possible. She absolutely can have the wedding she wants. I want her to be happy. The parents don\u2019t have the financial ability to contribute to her wedding, and my spouse and I paid for our own wedding less than a year ago. It\u2019s just a financial timeline crunch on all fronts.", "INFO: have you asked her to help you get there?", "the context doesn't much matter, honestly. this situation is more than capable of standing on its own. the real test of your sister's true self is going to be when you actually tell her all the logistical impossibilities of actually attending her wedding. if she's as good as you believe, then she'll be mortified for how much hardship this is going to put people through, which is going to be everybody and not just you. nobody short of Bezos can finagle an international destination wedding in three months.\n\nbut you need to stop making this about... it's not brave or bold to do this. it's *selfish* regardless of her intent. and you have, for better or worse, have fed into this by moving heaven and earth to try and make her life work out as perfectly as she now expects it to be.", "Are her fianc\u00e9s parents paying for the wedding?", "I hope you\u2019re right. The combination of a quick wedding and the social isolation of moving far away raises some pretty big red flags for me. It\u2019s easy to seem like a great guy for a short time. Not that you\u2019d be in any position to do much about it anyway.", "There are so many reasons I believe they\u2019re right. Way longer then I could ever list in a Reddit response. I completely understand how you\u2019re feeling, and my natural inclination is to feel the same. They really are wonderful together. If I didn\u2019t believe it, I wouldn\u2019t be stressed about getting to the wedding, I\u2019d be stressed trying to prevent it lol"]}
