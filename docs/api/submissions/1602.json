The bio parent is insecure because they aren\u2019t with their kids other parent. The family is broken up, for whatever reason. So in order to have that core nuclear family, they push their kids to love and accept their stepparent in a way they do their bio parents. For the stepparent, I think the insecurities come from a lack of biological connection to their step kids, and hurt feelings over not being the first spouse/person to make their partner a parent. \n\nI blame the parent they\u2019re married to more than anyone.

But I never have, do not, and never will consider you my Second Mom.\n\nYou married my parent, which means some of the time and money you spend with him gets spent on me. That does not mean you became my parent. You simply married one.\n\nIt would be the same if you and Dad broke up and your own children had a StepMom one day. Hopefully she would be a nice person, but she wouldn't be Mom.\n\nAt this point your behavior is bordering on harassment. You need to stop.\n\nI will only be a minor for less than 2 years. I hope that we can build a relationship based on reality in that time, namely that you are not my Mom.\n\nOnce I am an adult I will be under no obligation to ever speak to you again. Whether or not we have a relationship then depends on your behavior now. I am hoping we can build one of mutual respect which includes not ignoring the reality that you are not my Mom.\n\nI can understand it is difficult for you to process this, given you have been living in denial for so many years. But your emotions are not my responsibility to regulate. I hope you can find a therapist that can help you do that if you need to. \n\nPlease stop harassing me.

Most courts will listen to kids over 14, at least somewhat. Could you just arrange to stay at friends' houses the weekends you'd be at your dad's? \n\nIf you aren't safe to do this next thought, absolutely do not. You need him to provide for you and hopefully he'll help get you set up in college/work/training/whatever you pick after high school. Maybe this conversation has to wait until you don't need him financially, IDK. But, one conversation where you say, \"If you love me as much as you say you do then you need to know you are pushing me away and pushing me to go to very little contact with you as soon as I can\" might help.  I've had some luck explaining to someone that because they love me they must not understand how badly they were affecting me. But, again, it's much more important that you still have his support while you need it.", ">Obviously there was never any confusion about who is mom\n\nThat's the difference. OP's stepmom deliberately tried to introduce confusion about who is mom. She complained when her Christmas and birthday gifts weren't addressed \"to mom\".

Judges like this get kids killed!", "> She had not given any reason other than her stem mom aggressively wanting a relationship. \n\nThis is a really normal reason not to want a relationship. Someone aggressively stomping your boundaries is not something that typically inspires intimacy. There are AITA posts from people who don't like their step-parents for this reason all the time.

The judges reasoning was that a child needs their father. Sadly this was/is a very messed up city, so nothing was done. While I believe (or atleast hope) most of the time courts do take into consideration what the child wants, it's not always the case and like you said can get them killed.", "Nta Its ironic if the woman never pushed for that pose,  you'd prove be closer to her now. It's the same way some step parents never try to bond or be close when they are compared to the big parent.\n\nIf people are just allowed to be themselves  its easier. I understand why grandma was invited.  I'm sure she had a great time and felt loved for you asking her. It was sweet of you to do.", "NTA. I absolutely loathe step-parents who try to force themselves into a position of parenthood, ESPECIALLY when the original parent is STILL ON THE SCENE. Step-parents, respect the wishes of your step-children! Please!!! You can't, and WON'T earn the love of a child by forcing them into situations that they aren't comfortable with. \n\nRespect the fact that they are most likely still going to love their original parents. There is nothing you can do to force closeness, and EVERYTHING you can do to push them away", "NTA. She has been trying to push herself on you since you were 5. She is so very wrong. \n\nI am a stepdad myself. I never make demands or push my step-daughters. When I first met them, I told them that I am not their dad and I am not his replacement. I am just here to help. They have graciously included me in every part of their lives which I am very thankful for. \n\nYou have not done anything wrong. Your stepmother needs to step back and let you come to her, if you ever want to. As long as she keeps pushing, she is pushing you away. I am surprised after a decade of failure, that she hasn't learned the lesson yet. And your dad is foolish in not stepping up to save you both some aggravation. He risks losing you as an adult since he is not protecting you from the stepmother's ministrations.", "NTA and coming from someone who has a step parent that is similar, don\u2019t fake it.

She's always been great and has tried to advocate for me with my dad.", "I'm sorry you have a stepparent like that. I understand where you're coming from, but when someone constantly competes with your mom and has jealous reactions to everything related to your mom, it's hard to be thankful for them.", "I have told her I do not consider her my mom.

Often times like cooking my own food and stuff is rejected because \"family meal time\" stuff but I would not be upset at all if she stopped doing stuff for me.", "I do actually think it comes from a good place.\n\nBecause there's the obvious trope of the wicked step mom who hates the kids, she goes totally in the other direction and smother them with love. \n\nAnd then because the step-mom is trying so hard to be loving to the kid, she's upset when it's not reciprocated.", "They never successfully forced me.
