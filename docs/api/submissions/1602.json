The bio parent is insecure because they aren\u2019t with their kids other parent. The family is broken up, for whatever reason. So in order to have that core nuclear family, they push their kids to love and accept their stepparent in a way they do their bio parents. For the stepparent, I think the insecurities come from a lack of biological connection to their step kids, and hurt feelings over not being the first spouse/person to make their partner a parent. \n\nI blame the parent they\u2019re married to more than anyone.

You sound petty.", "Yeah, I've always wondered on the same thing.

Without ANY sabotage it\u2019s completely unrealistic that a 5 years old would not build *some* kind of positive relationship with a stepparent who is not abusive or mean (and she does not mention anything like that at all); heck 5 years olds build caring and attached relationships with their *kindergarden* teachers.\n\nThere is no way that I buy that bio mom had not SOME hand in the mess that they are currently in; regardless at this point it is probably too late for a fix and it will end up with OP going LC or NC with both when she is 18 - and basically losing out on what *could* have been enriching relationships under different circumstances.", "Given that he doesn't like receiving cards (he thinks they're a waste of money), my bio sister and I don't give him a card.

Sure the step mom didn\u2019t have to take care of OP or anything like that, that\u2019s bio parents\u2019 responsibility, but step mom is an adult, and made that decision. Just because she decided she would do it doesn\u2019t mean she needs to be treated exactly the same as bio mom. Relationships with children aren\u2019t supposed to be transactional. You can\u2019t force your step kids to do stuff for you that they don\u2019t want to just because you took care of them. For some families, being a step parent works out great, others not so much. A step parent isn\u2019t supposed to overstep or force something, it\u2019ll make the kids resist even harder, & if the parent married to the step parent tries to force it, there\u2019s a chance they might likely lose their kids altogether. OP isn\u2019t required to do anything for step mom on Mother\u2019s Day if she doesn\u2019t want to. Bio mom may not have even meddled with anything, and it\u2019s a huge leap to just assume she brainwashed OP into disliking step mom. Children are humans too, they have their own feelings and thought processes. If step mom hadn\u2019t tried forcing a relationship for the past 11 years, and had actually taken the time to allow OP to process everything and take that first step, there\u2019s a chance they could have had some form of relationship by now.

As the daughter of divorce I do have a couple questions however. Why, when she so clearly loves you, do you avoid your stepmom? Is it because you feel that she took your father away from you or your mother? I do understand these thoughts. As you become an adult you have an opportunity to have a relationship with this woman who is important to your father as an equal not as a mother daughter if you choose to. I was not blessed with a biological mother who was warm and loving. She is the type of person who will tell you that she is warm and loving, but she is really very narcissistic. My stepmother and I have had our ups and downs. When I was a teenager we did not get along. When I was young before my dad and my stepmom married I was my dad's only girl. So when my dad remarried I kind of felt like my stepmom took him away from me. I was mad. And then they had three more girls, which made me really mad. When I was a teenager I was resentful. I hated being told what to do by this woman who was not my mom. But as I've gotten older and I've realized how many manipulative my biological mom is, and I've seen how much my stepmom honestly loves me and I've seen how much she's done for me over my life and how well she treated my dad I realize how much she means to me. My stepmom is honestly one of my best friends and my three half sisters are my best friends.

She sounds reasonable and patient. If you offer some bonding time, she will be happy. If you feel that you can\u2019t, that\u2019s ok too. I\u2019m a stepmom. I have to be patient. My kiddo barely speaks to me. I let it go (it\u2019s hard and I struggle). I tell myself that we will bond when he is in his 20s. He is 17 now.
