He blamed everything on her. She was 1 at the time. He would get mad over her being a kid. Smh still pisses me off. She isn't your blood. The fact is she is jealous of you and your mom.

She's a nice lady. \n\nBut when someone forces you to call them mom, when the most important thing about the relationship is the title, they are already working in a framework that doesn't equal parent. Parents put their kids first. Parents keep their hurt feelings to themselves until it's necessary to teach some life lesson. \n\nMy kids' dad and stepmother blame me for alienating them, but I never did. Quite the opposite.

I spent Christmas with my siblings, never like it was when my Mom was alive.\n\nMother's Day though, my siblings and I ended up seeing her and Dad I honestly thought we made more of an effort to treat her like a mom then her own kids.

He and siblings (and her) where mad, hurt, and didn't understand why I did that. \n\nJoy wasn't my Mom. She never wanted to be. Did I like her? Sure, and yes I had some nice times with her.

The bio parent is insecure because they aren\u2019t with their kids other parent. The family is broken up, for whatever reason. So in order to have that core nuclear family, they push their kids to love and accept their stepparent in a way they do their bio parents. For the stepparent, I think the insecurities come from a lack of biological connection to their step kids, and hurt feelings over not being the first spouse/person to make their partner a parent. \n\nI blame the parent they\u2019re married to more than anyone.

Obviously there was never any confusion about who is mom, but I also emphasized from the beginning to him that she is taking care of him well while he is with dad and that because she is doing similar things that a mom is doing when he is there, she is also something like a second mom or at least a maternal figure. On Mothers Day I made it a point to send a little flower and some sweets back to her, when I brought him to his dad (we usually exchange Sun anyways) as a thank you from both - me and my kiddo - for the work she has been doing for him.\n\nI wonder how much OPs bio mom had to do over the years with OPs staunch dislike of stepmom, because other than \u201cshe wants to be involved\u201d OP has not really brought a good reason to why she does not like her; and I bet if it was reversed and she wanted nothing to do with OP, then that would be used against her too.", "She brought an excellent reason: because the stepmom was forcing it.
