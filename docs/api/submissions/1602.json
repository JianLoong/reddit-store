It is absolutely ridiculous to claim the right of being a mom to someone just because of who you married. She has tried to force a relationship with you instead of actually building one with you. She is overstepping, and from what you describe it sounds like you have had a lot of restraint (especially considering your age) by framing it as being about being with your grandmother as opposed to excluding her. \n\nHowever, if you did want to extend an olive branch, you could explain all of how you feel clearly & give her a path to wiping the slate clean & forming a friendship as opposed to some sad forced mom role that you tolerate.", "NTA what is the deal with step parents trying to force relationships? Shame on your dad for saying that. You have 1 mom. You can invite whoever you want to a school function. Stepmom has set herself up for failure trying to force a relationship on you. Edit. All they are doing is pushing you away with this behavior.", "Nta. She not your mom if you dont want her to be and you dont have to invite her to anything you dont want to.

I would have a sit-down conversation with your stepmom and let her know hi I know you're in my life and I respect you as a person but please stop with the competing with my mom. You don't have to tell her you dislike her. Just tell her that you're not comfortable with it.

Your mom should speak to your dad about this.", "Nta and you should tell her she will never be your mother. I don\u2019t like her.", "NTA. I wonder if she's doing this because she genuinely cares for you or just wants to throw her weight around. Either way, she's wrong for forcing you to do these things.", "NTA", "Nta-", "Nta and really you are old enough now to decide if you want to be around her and your own schedule.   People don't realize the more you push and try to force the less you are really wanted.   Respect and space would probably go farther."]}
