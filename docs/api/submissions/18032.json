They\u2019re just mad because they\u2019ve been mooching off you for so long. You are not responsible for paying for other people to use Netflix and I\u2019m honestly surprised they would even expect that.", "NTA - it doesn\u2019t matter if you can afford it or not because it\u2019s not within your budget to pay for their entertainment. Change your password and kick out all devices.", "Nta.  It's 8 dollars.  They can buy their own.", "Definitely NTA. The fact that you can pay for it doesn't mean that you must pay for it. Change your password. If they want to continue streaming, then they should pay for their own service.", "NTA. Yes, they are being the cheap jerks", "Send an email that  given Netflix's policy change you going to eliminate all the accounts next billing cycle because it will increase your bill.", "NTA. If they think it's so easy to pay $8/month, they can pay for Netflix themselves.", "The entitlement! NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are already cutting back things in your life. It is silly to be paying $8 for each of them to watch Netflix. Let them each get their own Netflix account. Change the password and if they want their own account they can sign up.", "NTA.\n\nThey need to grow up. Very immature take. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. You don\u2019t owe them Netflix access.", "NTA, your account, your money, your decision. Just tell them you will cancel your subscription, change your password and opt for the cheaper version.", "NTA\nNever mind their complaints. If they live independently from you, and they are not financially dependent on you to support them, cut them off. If they think $8 is no big deal, then they can send you the money in advance every month or every quarter or even for the entire year. If they don't send the money, then their access is closed as soon as the billing cycle is no longer covered by their funds. If they claim they can't afford it, then they should not expect you to pay for their wants over your needs and wants. If they are financially strapped to the point of not having $8-10/month to cover Netflix, then they either have serious financial problems or their priorities are devoted to other avenues for whatever leisure funds that have in the budget. Streaming services are a want, not a need. I am assuming that their livelihoods and educations do not depend on having Netflix access. If it did, then it would be paid by their employer or available through their educational institution. \n\nAs people often say on this subreddit, don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. So don't sacrifice your own financial stability for other people's comfort.", "NTA. They can have their own accounts. \nYou should just change password and tell them that you\u2019re using all your screens so they\u2019ll have to fend for themselves.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe extended family streaming privileges. \n\nFeel free to give them the option of continuing payments for Netflix or a Christmas present for their household. $8x12 months equals a  good holiday gift by most standards.", "NTA - It was a good 10-yr FREE benefit. They need to create shared services amongst themselves. It does not matter if you can 'afford' it or not. Free sharing is no longer offered.", "NTA - they can choose to pay, or choose to not have Netflix.", "\"When it didn't cost extra, I had no trouble sharing with you in order to save you money. By my account, I've saved you $X over Y months, asking nothing in return.\n\nBut now the rules have changed and I can't take on this expense any longer. It's time for you to get your own account. I'll be changing the password on (this date). Please plan accordingly.\"\n\nThat's the end of the conversation. Anyone who complains is the AH. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\nThey are the ones being cheap. Netflix is not a necessity. Tell them that if they cannot afford a streaming service, they should get a library card and entertain themselves by reading instead.", "NTA, though I do wonder if there'd be scope for (assuming you can trust them to set up something that pays automatically that you won't end up having to chase) getting them to chip in $5/month each? It'd cost them less than a full account, and if it's even just two other people paying, that more than covers the extra cost for you.", "INFO: Who are we talking about? Is this kids, parents, or your 3rd cousin, twice removed?", "INFO: Are these family members your children?\n\nNTA; even if they are your adult children, you don't *owe* them free Netflix. That said, if they ARE your children, it might be worthwhile to evaluate whether you're willing to pay for a few things for them, just to help take care of them a bit - this economy is not kind to Millennials and younger.\n\nIf they are NOT your children, cut them loose. They can decide for themselves whether Netflix is worth eight bucks a month to them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My sister and I split services. I pay Netflix and Disney+, she pays Hulu and HBO max. But if they aren't splitting it with you then they should pay the new fee.

For the multi-screen option plus one extra household, I could get (all ad supported) Hulu w/ disney+ add on, peacock, and Max(discovery+ and HBO max combined, starting June 1) for maybe $1-2 more per month. Bye bye, Netflix! NTA.", "Thank you.", "Will do!", "It wouldn't because each user outside OP's household needs to pay $8.00. Also I believe that user can only have two additional users on her account.\n\nAlso OP is potentially paying for a higher level of Netflix service than she needs to.\n\nShe can pay $9.99 for one stream at a time. That is fine so long as she and her husband don't want to watch different shows at the same time.
