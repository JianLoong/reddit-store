I live with my boyfriend, so my dog is usually off-duty while I am at home. I also have a niece (15f) that gets seizures as well. My dog was trained by a professional dog trainer and it cost me $15,000 to get her trained. I saved up for years and my boyfriend helped me as well. Two days ago my sister (40f) asked if my niece could borrow my service dog for her birthday. She wants to go to the mall with a few of her friends. She is not usually allowed to go places without my sister because of her seizures. I told her that I couldn\u2019t do that. My dog is trained to respond to me and I don\u2019t know how she\u2019d do with my niece. I also don\u2019t like the idea of having my dog in public without me and I also need my dog for my own seizures. My sister got mad and said it would only be for a few hours and that I should be willing to help out family since everyone helped me while I was growing up. She called my mom and while my mom agrees with me she also doesn\u2019t want to upset my sister so she wants me to let her use my dog for a few hours tomorrow. My boyfriend says I\u2019m in the right but I keep getting calls from family members saying I\u2019m being selfish.

She may not even be effective at helping your niece, and the last thing you want is for your niece to find this out while having a seisure. Sounds like the prudent option is to not allow her to use your service dog.", "NTA\n\nNot even a teeny tiny fragment of an AH.", "NTA.   \n\n\nService Animals are not meant to change the person they are supporting. They have been trained to provide very narrow support for one specific person. This skill is not transferable.    \n\n\nIf you want, offer to help them understand the process and navigate it, as a compromise.", "NTA\u2026I\u2026 just wut? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong because I\u2019m woefully uneducated on this but isn\u2019t that service dog trained to recognize your cues?

Tell her to take a hike, NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nFrom my understanding service dogs are extensively trained to work with a specific person. Especially seizure alert dogs. \n\nYes they are a medical device but they are a personalized medical device. \n\nYour service dog is trained to respond to your medical condition and more importantly you are trained to respond to the cues your service dog gives you. \n\nLetting your niece \"borrow\" a medical device that is not customized for her, that she is not trained to respond to is a complete recipe for disaster.", "NTA\n\nYou're right. Your SD is trained specifically to you. It's not something that you can just loan out.\n\nThat'd be like if your sister asked to borrow your prosthetic leg for her daughter, who so happens to also need a prosthetic leg. \n\nEven if you allowed her to borrow the prosthetic because you weren't using it at home, it would literally do the daughter no good. She needs her own.", "You don't share prescriptions. \n\nNTA.  Your sister should be investing in a service dog so her daughter can have some freedom. What is she going to do when her daughter goes to college? Insist on yours. Like hell.", "Oh hell no, NTA. This is not like letting your niece borrow a pair of shoes or a purse. Your service animal is trained to you just like my service dog is trained to assist me. I understand your niece wanting to go out with her friends and her mom being concerned because of niece\u2019s seizures. I have epilepsy in addition to a host of other things and my seizing was at its peak when I was a teenager. This is not s problem that\u2019s going to be solved in a one size fits all manner by lending her your dog.", "NTA. Your dog is expensive medical equipment", "NTA - but it sounds like more your sister and niece dont understand how service dogs work.", "NTA\n\nLike you said, your dog was trained to respond to YOUR seizures. This means your niece would not be protected or supported in the way they think she would. It would be no different than if she went alone. Not only are you nta, but the people saying YATA aren\u2019t willing to listen and understand the reason behind you saying no to the point of literally putting you niece at risk.", "NTA\n\nWTF? Your dog is trained for you. No one has any idea how he will react if your niece has a seizure, or if he will be able to foretell one in her like (I assume) he does for you. And anyway, he doesn't *prevent* seizures. I think it will be worse if he's with her, by instilling a false sense of confidence. \n\nYour sister should go to the mall with your niece, but let her walk around with her friends by themselves. If your niece does have a seizure, then her friends can call her mom and she'll be right there.", "Although I totally understand your sister, NTA. A service dog is nothing that you just borrow. God forbids, something happens to either of them. You are in the right and reacted sensibly and responsibly.\n\nTo smooth the waters with family, you could offer to train and introduce your niece to the dog, provided that your niece is a reasonable young lady and the insurances approve. But I fear that this could lead to even more pressure to \"lend\" the dog.\n\nBest thing might be, to ask the family to fund your niece her own dog. See how many contribute to that.", "NTA. The animal is trained for you. No one can say if it can help your niece if she has a seizure. So it would be completly false to relay on the dog. Why doesn't your sister or niece told her closed friends what should be done, if she has a seizure? If someone should look out for sights, to call her mother or the ambulance or something like that. Would be more helpfull (and more often usable) than the service dog of her aunt.", "NTA and don't even consider it.\n\nOffer to educate SIL and niece about the process of getting a service dog, and help them start the process. Instead of gifts, your niece could ask for donations toward saving up for a service dog.", "Good heavens NTA.  That really wouldn't be fair to the *dog*, or to you, and all the reasons you gave were valid.", "NTA IMMEDIATELY. That\u2019s a goddamn SERVICE DOG?? You are in the right. There should be no reason for someone to use YOUR service dog if they don\u2019t need it. Like, That\u2019s messed up.", "NTA:  \nThat dog is yours. Trained for you and your situation. There is no guarantee that your dog would be able to help.   \nI know a lot of service dog users. I do not know any who would lend out a dog like that.", "NTA. In addition to your completely legitimate reasons, would your sister do you s $15,000 favor involving  a bunch of  teenage kids with no idea other than lets have fun ? Huge NTA here", "NTA and they're just going to have to get over it. Service dogs aren't to be lent out to whoever needs it at the moment. They're not rental cars.", "I feel for your niece, it has to be hard to try and be a teenager with epilepsy. However, a service dog is not something you 'borrow' under any circumstances. The subtlety of training a service animal to a specific person is complex and will not necessarily translate. Not to mention that they also become emotional support animals simply by the dog-owned feeling safer, better protected, when their animal is near. \n\nAs to your family. I would hope that everyone helped you growing up. That is what family is for, not to be used as a battering ram later on. Give your sister the information on service dogs. There are some organizations that can help defray the cost. NTA", "NTA - It\u2019s your service dog ! Also, what if something was to happen and your service dog was severely injured or even worse ?!", "NTA, do they not even realize how long it takes a service dog to get accustomed to one person's behavior? Assuming that your dog would be able to queue off your niece the way she queues off you is highly irresponsible and could endanger your niece.", "NTA\n\nThat took a lot of time and money to train your dog and there is no guarantee it would even work on your niece.\n\n\"I keep getting calls from family members saying I\u2019m being selfish\"\n\nProblem solved.  They can all chip in and pay to get one trained for your niece!  These problems are usually a lot harder!  :-)", "NTA\n\nThis is not a community service dog. This is your service dog that responds to your needs and while your service dog may respond if your niece has a seizure with her friends, would they even know what to do with that? Or what if something happens and the dog is mistreated and attacks out of retaliation because your niece doesn\u2019t know how to redirect your dog?\n\nThis is a well intended a request, but ill advised. The service dog is supposed to be with you 24 hours a day for a reason and like you said, what happens if you have a seizure and the dog is not with you This is not a good idea. The service dog is your responsibility And you\u2019re his responsibility you\u2019re supposed to be a team.\n\nI would say no and your mom should not think you should play nice to keep your sister happy. If your sister is so hell-bent on making sure that her daughter is safe while she goes to the mall, she herself should get a service dog for her daughter, and not try to borrow yours. She also has the option to go to the mall with her, but your service dog is not an option.", "NTA\n\nBy your sister's logic surely her daughter can manage without a dog for only a few hours.\n\nThe money you spent to train your dog is immaterial.  It's *your* service dog and no one else's.\n\nYour sister needs to find a way to manage her daughter's seizures so she can live a full life, not just try and find a quick fix on her birthday.", "NTA. It is Your service dog. The dog that you paid $15,000 for. Your sis & other family members are being entitled AHs who obviously don't care about you. These family members need to chip in & help sis/niece get their own damned service dog. \n\nI don't know much about service dogs, but aren't they trained exclusively for a specific person? And wouldn't loaning out your service dog negate her bond with you, requiring retraining? Because if both my questions are correct, that would be the statement I would be giving out. You shelled out a lot of money for your service dog. Why should you have to shell out more when the dog has to go through training again?", "NTA - if your sister is that upset about it she should try and get her daughter her own service dog. Your service dog is there to service you, as you also stated you're unaware how your service dog would do with your niece.", "NTA - a service dog is not an item of clothing you can share because you\u2019re both the same size. They are highly skilled aides. If they can recognise your service dog\u2019s ability and training, then they should definitely be able to understand that your service dog has been specifically trained for you. They\u2019re wilfully ignoring the latter fact. If they want your niece to have a service dog then they need to look at getting her own.", "NTA Your sister is. Your dog is trained for you. You have no idea what might happen when he's out of your care. Let your sister get a dog for your niece.", "NTA. This is a living, thinking being whose job is to look after you. You can't just loan her out. It will just confuse her and she won't be effective for anyone else.", "NTA. You can just share a service animal!", "Wow. I guess I can see where your sister is coming from, and it crazy stinks that niece can't go anywhere, but, you're not wrong. You DON'T know how your dog will do with someone other than you.

This way her daughter has privacy with her friends and she can still be close to help if something goes wrong.", "NTA - Think of whatever medically needed device or medication and ask them if they would be OK sharing it with someone else?  Hey, can I borrow your fake leg?  Can I borrow your pacemaker?  Your niece IS your sister's problem, NOT YOURS.", "Service dogs being attacked by fake service dog pets in non pet friendly places is becoming increasingly common as more people are feeling more entitled to bring their dogs everywhere. Is she mature enough to understand preventing and responding to dog attacks? Would they be willing to pay for a new dog to be trained if this one is washed out due to developing anxiety or a fear response as a result? Yes, it\u2019s unlikely that would occur on her one outing with them. But is it worth the risk? Absolutely not. \n\nOn top of that, does she know what all of the dog\u2019s tasks and alerts are? Does she know how to and how not to respond to their alerts? Would she ignore them until it\u2019s too late because she\u2019s having fun with her friends and not paying attention or doesn\u2019t want to stop?

To take one of them away from me and be in a place where something could happen to her\u2026no, that\u2019s not a good idea to maintain a healthy relationship with friends or family.

Give your service pup some pats for me!", "NTA. If you were both diabetic, would you share insulin and needles? Doubtful, so, same with service dog. It's medicine. Not to be shared.", "NTA, I have a teenager and I wouldn't let my teenager take our dog with her to an unsupervised get together at a mall and she loves the dog. People are unpredictable and most teenagers are still learning how to assert themselves and enforce boundaries, while other teenagers are dead set on seeing how many buttons they can push and what they can get away with. Your niece has not had to save up for years for this dog, she has not had to deal with applications or waiting lists, and as a child she still has the protection and assistance of her parents for the next few years. You've put in the work and as an independent adult you'll suffer more than embarrassing outings if something happens to the dog or interferes with their training. If nothing bad happens this time they will almost surely ask again..The answer is no. The dog is prescribed to you and undergone expensive training to recognize and assist with your cues. Don't offer alternatives, don't feel like you need to help, this is your sister's issue to solve and if she feels her daughter would be well served by a service dog she should invest in one. It's low for her to bring up the assistance you needed when you were younger when it likely did not come from her pocket, especially as your service dog has probably granted you some independence and what she's suggesting may compromise that.", "What?!  NTA!  I'm sorry your niece has seizures, but that doesn't make her entitled to take YOUR service dog.  Their request is absolutely inappropriate.  Not to mention, the dog was very expensive.  What if something happened her?  Who is going to find and pay for training for a replacement dog?", "Sooo NTA. Your sister assumed that\na) you'd be cool giving up your potential life saving animal\nb) that you'd be ok with being housebound that day\nc) that your boyfriend is fine with sitting inside your house all day\nd) that the dog would actually be able to help, and \ne) the untrained dog might actually make the situation worse.\n\nAnd then sprung it on you at the last minute so you couldn't say no without looking like an AH because she didn't bother to figure out an alternative way to deal with this issue if you said no.\n\nIt's important to remember that as far as service dogs go, you're the family expert, so trust your judgement on that.\n\nAlso, if you do let your niece use your dog, and the dog doesn't respond to her seizure and she is seriously hurt or worse, your sister is absolutely going to spin it round to be your fault for not informing her that your dog wouldn't be able to help. \n\nLet your sister be mad at you for making sure that your niece will be safe.

Has there been any prior experience of your niece with your dog? Sounds like not. \n\nImportantly it can be dangerous for your niece too. I'd imagine there's way too many signals for seizures that would be specific to the person having the seizure. Your dog is trained to look out for YOURS. That may not be the same kind of triggers or signs for your niece so the dog may not alert properly. The niece might not know what a proper alert is from the dog or how she is supposed to respond. \n\nIt's like you took an employee who does stocking work at a grocery store and plop them into another grocery store unexpectedly. Different stores, different policies. There may be similar stock but they would go in completely different places and even stock that is completely unfamiliar. You can't expect them to work appropriately without retraining for the purposes of THIS environment.\n\nAnd that also completely disregards your own needs because even if it somehow worked, then it meant that you and your boyfriend are stuck at home with no freedom to leave the house.
