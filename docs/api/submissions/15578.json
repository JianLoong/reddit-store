I live with my boyfriend, so my dog is usually off-duty while I am at home. I also have a niece (15f) that gets seizures as well. My dog was trained by a professional dog trainer and it cost me $15,000 to get her trained. I saved up for years and my boyfriend helped me as well. Two days ago my sister (40f) asked if my niece could borrow my service dog for her birthday. She wants to go to the mall with a few of her friends. She is not usually allowed to go places without my sister because of her seizures. I told her that I couldn\u2019t do that. My dog is trained to respond to me and I don\u2019t know how she\u2019d do with my niece. I also don\u2019t like the idea of having my dog in public without me and I also need my dog for my own seizures. My sister got mad and said it would only be for a few hours and that I should be willing to help out family since everyone helped me while I was growing up. She called my mom and while my mom agrees with me she also doesn\u2019t want to upset my sister so she wants me to let her use my dog for a few hours tomorrow. My boyfriend says I\u2019m in the right but I keep getting calls from family members saying I\u2019m being selfish. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone. My family got into my head and made me second guess myself, but I feel more confident in my answer now. I\u2019m going to have a conversation with my sister and see if I can help her come up with another idea for my niece.", "created_utc": 1682354740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xoqhc/aita_for_not_letting_for_niece_borrow_my_service/", "score": 3513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dog is trained for you. No one has any idea how he will react if your niece has a seizure, or if he will be able to foretell one in her like (I assume) he does for you. And anyway, he doesn't *prevent* seizures. I think it will be worse if he's with her, by instilling a false sense of confidence. \n\nYour sister should go to the mall with your niece, but let her walk around with her friends by themselves. If your niece does have a seizure, then her friends can call her mom and she'll be right there.", "Although I totally understand your sister, NTA. A service dog is nothing that you just borrow. God forbids, something happens to either of them. You are in the right and reacted sensibly and responsibly.\n\nTo smooth the waters with family, you could offer to train and introduce your niece to the dog, provided that your niece is a reasonable young lady and the insurances approve. But I fear that this could lead to even more pressure to \"lend\" the dog.\n\nBest thing might be, to ask the family to fund your niece her own dog. See how many contribute to that.", "NTA. The animal is trained for you. No one can say if it can help your niece if she has a seizure. So it would be completly false to relay on the dog. Why doesn't your sister or niece told her closed friends what should be done, if she has a seizure? If someone should look out for sights, to call her mother or the ambulance or something like that. Would be more helpfull (and more often usable) than the service dog of her aunt.", "NTA and don't even consider it.\n\nOffer to educate SIL and niece about the process of getting a service dog, and help them start the process. Instead of gifts, your niece could ask for donations toward saving up for a service dog.", "Good heavens NTA.  That really wouldn't be fair to the *dog*, or to you, and all the reasons you gave were valid.", "NTA IMMEDIATELY. That\u2019s a goddamn SERVICE DOG?? You are in the right.

They're not rental cars.", "I feel for your niece, it has to be hard to try and be a teenager with epilepsy. However, a service dog is not something you 'borrow' under any circumstances. The subtlety of training a service animal to a specific person is complex and will not necessarily translate. Not to mention that they also become emotional support animals simply by the dog-owned feeling safer, better protected, when their animal is near. \n\nAs to your family. I would hope that everyone helped you growing up. That is what family is for, not to be used as a battering ram later on. Give your sister the information on service dogs.

Also, what if something was to happen and your service dog was severely injured or even worse ?!", "NTA, do they not even realize how long it takes a service dog to get accustomed to one person's behavior?

Or what if something happens and the dog is mistreated and attacks out of retaliation because your niece doesn\u2019t know how to redirect your dog?\n\nThis is a well intended a request, but ill advised. The service dog is supposed to be with you 24 hours a day for a reason and like you said, what happens if you have a seizure and the dog is not with you This is not a good idea. The service dog is your responsibility And you\u2019re his responsibility you\u2019re supposed to be a team.\n\nI would say no and your mom should not think you should play nice to keep your sister happy. If your sister is so hell-bent on making sure that her daughter is safe while she goes to the mall, she herself should get a service dog for her daughter, and not try to borrow yours. She also has the option to go to the mall with her, but your service dog is not an option.", "NTA\n\nBy your sister's logic surely her daughter can manage without a dog for only a few hours.\n\nThe money you spent to train your dog is immaterial.

People are unpredictable and most teenagers are still learning how to assert themselves and enforce boundaries, while other teenagers are dead set on seeing how many buttons they can push and what they can get away with. Your niece has not had to save up for years for this dog, she has not had to deal with applications or waiting lists, and as a child she still has the protection and assistance of her parents for the next few years. You've put in the work and as an independent adult you'll suffer more than embarrassing outings if something happens to the dog or interferes with their training. If nothing bad happens this time they will almost surely ask again..The answer is no. The dog is prescribed to you and undergone expensive training to recognize and assist with your cues. Don't offer alternatives, don't feel like you need to help, this is your sister's issue to solve and if she feels her daughter would be well served by a service dog she should invest in one.

It's not about being selfish, it just won't work. It will also confuse the dog and you might have to pay a shit ton to get him retrained.", "NTA... Just... No, don't do that. Many organizations that professionally train service dogs even have in contract that you can't borrow your dog to someone else.\n\nThe dog responds to you and not to her. The dog will be likely confused and stressed. Your niece and/or her surroundings (such as people treating your dog like a pet instead of service dog and her not correcting it immediately), could threaten and damage the work you and your dog put into this. And as/like you said, you need your dog.\n\nIt's going to be way easier and safer if your sister simply goes to the mall too. Remind her that she herself says that \"it's only for a few hours\", she can surely do that. ;) And if she needs help more frequently, well, she should get her daughter her own service dog.\n\nAlso, a service dog is a medical equipment/device basically. So it's not exactly \"helping someone\" as in borrowing a pen, I would rather compare it to wanting to borrow a retainer. With some things, you simply need to get your own!\n\nDon't give in and make sure they don't try to steal your dog. Your sister sounds horribly entitled and uneducated about this topic (service dogs), so that's one more reason to not to be okay letting her or her daughter have him for a few hours.", "NTA. That request is insane. It makes about as much sense as her asking you to lend her daughter your glasses for a few hours because she's nearsighted too or something...", "NTA.\n\nthis is like asking somebody without the use of their legs if you can borrow their wheelchair, or asking a diabetic if you can borrow their insulin pump, or asking a deaf person if you can borrow their hearing aids. just because you are similarly disabled doesn't mean you can take the medical devices of another disabled person. you need your dog in order to keep yourself safe.\n\nyour niece is not entitled to YOUR service animal (including the years of work + thousands of dollars) but it seems like she needs one of her own. maybe you could offer to help get your niece her own service dog, or at the very least point her and her mom to similar resources to what you had in order to start them off on the right path.\n\nedit to add; I don't understand why everybody's being so mean to the niece here. was it a stupid question to ask? absolutely. but she's 15, and it seems like her mother has been in her ear about it... the niece is really not the problem here. her mom is.", "Umm what? They want to borrow an essential medical animal like it\u2019s a piece of clothing?gtfoh girl you did the right thing.. I personally wouldn\u2019t trust them not to not give the dog back or to continue asking to borrow your dog..The same way you skimped and saved for this animal they need to do the same thing.. block the entitled people calling with this bs till it blows over or until forever.. up to you NTA", "Service dog trainer here: NTA and the answer is NO. That is not a pet that is a medical device. If she wants her daughter to have one it is time to start saving or training.", "God NTA your extremely well trained dog is not some toy to be passed around. If she wants a dog her mother can get her one. You need the dog, you got the dog, if you relent even once it's going to constantly happen.", "NTA, that animal is trained for you, there is no telling that the dog will be of any use to your niece, as he/she may just be yearning to get back to you and even have an anxiety attack. You would be doing your niece a disservice by doing so. Best bet would be to have someone who is trained to handle seizures, also at the mall, just a different area, with a walkie talkie for nieces friends to use for emergency, even just knowing your number for in case.", "\"AITA for not letting my niece \"borrow\" my insulin pump?\"\n\n\"[...] My sister asked if my niece could borrow my insulin pump for her birthday. She wants to go to the mall with a few of her friends. She is not usually allowed to go places without my sister there to administer her shots. I told her that I couldn\u2019t do that. I rely on my insulin pump to keep me alive.\"\n\n\"[...] My sister got mad and said it would only be for a few hours and that I should be willing to help out family since everyone helped me while I was growing up. She called my mom and while my mom agrees with me she also doesn\u2019t want to upset my sister so she wants me to let her use my insulin pump for a few hours tomorrow. My boyfriend says I\u2019m in the right but I keep getting calls from family members saying I\u2019m being selfish for not pulling out my pump and putting me life at risk for a few hours so my niece can go to the mall for her birthday. So AITA?\"\n\nRIDICULOUS.\n\n***If your niece needs a service animal, your sister should be getting her one. Huuuuuuge NTA.***", "NTA. The dog is trained for *you*. What if your niece has a seizure that the dog didn't detect and then your sister blamed you for the failure? There's too many variables here.", "NTA your sister is just blatantly misinformed on how service animals work", "NTA.\n\nMaybe the family and relatives harassing you can put their money where their mouth is and pool together enough cash to buy a service dog for the Niece?", "NTA. Definitely! Your service dog is not a shareable commodity and way too precious to put in the hands of a 15 yr old who hasn\u2019t been trained to handle your specific dog. There\u2019s also no guarantee your dog would even alert for your niece, so it could give your aunt a false sense of security. All your reasons are valid. Your aunt is off base.", "\"hey i know you need your insulin or you'll die but could my kid borrow it for a while? you'll be fine without it dw it's just for a little bit\"\n\nyour service dog isn't a cute shirt or a bluetooth speaker, it's a medical need and something that could save your life. People shouldn't ask to borrow things that serve to keep you safe from a condition you can't control. You're NTA.", "Can you give the folks who trained your dog a call, explain your being pressured to loan out your service dog and ask if they'd be willing to speak with your mom and sister to explain to them why it's a bad idea? Unfortunately some adults won't listen to common sense if it comes from someone younger than them.\n\nI actually also wonder if it might not be considered interfering with a service dog and therefore illegal?....\n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40", "NTA at all. The family seems clueless as to how service animals work. I imagine sister made a commitment she now can't keep and is blaming you for it. Planning another birthday option is a great idea.", "NTA  \n\n\nI didn't need to read any more than the title.  You might possibly let a relative \"borrow\" a pet.  But a service dog is NOT A PET.  IT IS PART OF YOUR ABILITY TO LIVE.    \n\n\nNO ONE has the right to \"ask to borrow your service dog.\"  Not even for a few *minutes,* let alone hours.", "NTA. That\u2019s so clearly not how service dogs work. You can\u2019t just swap them out. Also, I wouldn\u2019t let anyone \u201cborrow\u201d my non-service dogs. Because that\u2019s not how pets work either.", "NTA. This could be seriously dangerous for niece as well. She will not pay attention anymore since she will trust the dog. But the dog knows your tells, not hers. Also even if the dog manages to warn niece of an incoming seizure, without an adult nearby who knows how to handle it, niece would still be in danger", "NTA and your mom is not agreeing with you if she is telling to go ahead and give in to your sister.", "NTA at all.. I have seizures too, and they are different for everyone. Your dog is trained to respond to YOUR queues, NOT your nieces.. It wouldn\u2019t even work for her! Does your family understand that?", "The niece needs her own service dog.  I too would be concerned about how the dog would respond to her should a life or death crisis occur while they're out.  People have to be trained as well with a new service animal.  And let's not forget about the poster who actually paid for everything.  What if she has an episode while away from her dog?", "NTA. A service dog is not the same as a wheelchair or pair of crutches. You can't just lend them out to whomever. Your sister was completely out of line, and enlisting other people in your family also is wrong. You don't get to pick when and where you have seizures. Your family should understand that.", "After hearing that horror story of the bride wanting to use an OP\u2019s dogs as ring bearers and broke into their house to steal them, ripping open fresh stitches from a recent surgery,  this is the way", "The chances this dog would even pay attention to your niece are NIL.", "Service dogs are not transferable \n\nThis. Period. Full stop. And for the others who say about the sister: if your child has seizures too, why aren't you trying for a service animal too?! The sister needs to be educated on what a service animal means and their work. She's trivializing it.", "If your niece is with friends, surely that is good enough if she is prone to seizures? She's 15 which isn't far from 18 and should start becoming more independent.", "I'm kind of confused. What role that your sister usually performs could your dog even do if your niece has a seizure? Or, more to the point, wouldn't your niece still need someone trained to respond?
