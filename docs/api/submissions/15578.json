I live with my boyfriend, so my dog is usually off-duty while I am at home. I also have a niece (15f) that gets seizures as well. My dog was trained by a professional dog trainer and it cost me $15,000 to get her trained. I saved up for years and my boyfriend helped me as well. Two days ago my sister (40f) asked if my niece could borrow my service dog for her birthday. She wants to go to the mall with a few of her friends. She is not usually allowed to go places without my sister because of her seizures. I told her that I couldn\u2019t do that. My dog is trained to respond to me and I don\u2019t know how she\u2019d do with my niece. I also don\u2019t like the idea of having my dog in public without me and I also need my dog for my own seizures. My sister got mad and said it would only be for a few hours and that I should be willing to help out family since everyone helped me while I was growing up. She called my mom and while my mom agrees with me she also doesn\u2019t want to upset my sister so she wants me to let her use my dog for a few hours tomorrow. My boyfriend says I\u2019m in the right but I keep getting calls from family members saying I\u2019m being selfish. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone. My family got into my head and made me second guess myself, but I feel more confident in my answer now. I\u2019m going to have a conversation with my sister and see if I can help her come up with another idea for my niece.", "created_utc": 1682354740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xoqhc/aita_for_not_letting_for_niece_borrow_my_service/", "score": 737, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your SD is trained specifically to you.

Your service animal is trained to you just like my service dog is trained to assist me. I understand your niece wanting to go out with her friends and her mom being concerned because of niece\u2019s seizures. I have epilepsy in addition to a host of other things and my seizing was at its peak when I was a teenager.

Your dog is trained for you. No one has any idea how he will react if your niece has a seizure, or if he will be able to foretell one in her like (I assume) he does for you. And anyway, he doesn't *prevent* seizures. I think it will be worse if he's with her, by instilling a false sense of confidence. \n\nYour sister should go to the mall with your niece, but let her walk around with her friends by themselves. If your niece does have a seizure, then her friends can call her mom and she'll be right there.", "Although I totally understand your sister, NTA. A service dog is nothing that you just borrow. God forbids, something happens to either of them. You are in the right and reacted sensibly and responsibly.\n\nTo smooth the waters with family, you could offer to train and introduce your niece to the dog, provided that your niece is a reasonable young lady and the insurances approve. But I fear that this could lead to even more pressure to \"lend\" the dog.\n\nBest thing might be, to ask the family to fund your niece her own dog. See how many contribute to that.", "NTA. The animal is trained for you. No one can say if it can help your niece if she has a seizure. So it would be completly false to relay on the dog. Why doesn't your sister or niece told her closed friends what should be done, if she has a seizure? If someone should look out for sights, to call her mother or the ambulance or something like that. Would be more helpfull (and more often usable) than the service dog of her aunt.", "NTA and don't even consider it.\n\nOffer to educate SIL and niece about the process of getting a service dog, and help them start the process. Instead of gifts, your niece could ask for donations toward saving up for a service dog.", "Good heavens NTA.  That really wouldn't be fair to the *dog*, or to you, and all the reasons you gave were valid.", "NTA IMMEDIATELY. That\u2019s a goddamn SERVICE DOG?? You are in the right.

They're not rental cars.", "I feel for your niece, it has to be hard to try and be a teenager with epilepsy. However, a service dog is not something you 'borrow' under any circumstances. The subtlety of training a service animal to a specific person is complex and will not necessarily translate. Not to mention that they also become emotional support animals simply by the dog-owned feeling safer, better protected, when their animal is near. \n\nAs to your family. I would hope that everyone helped you growing up. That is what family is for, not to be used as a battering ram later on. Give your sister the information on service dogs. There are some organizations that can help defray the cost. NTA", "NTA - It\u2019s your service dog ! Also, what if something was to happen and your service dog was severely injured or even worse ?!", "NTA, do they not even realize how long it takes a service dog to get accustomed to one person's behavior?

They can all chip in and pay to get one trained for your niece!  These problems are usually a lot harder!  :-)", "NTA\n\nThis is not a community service dog.

Or what if something happens and the dog is mistreated and attacks out of retaliation because your niece doesn\u2019t know how to redirect your dog?\n\nThis is a well intended a request, but ill advised. The service dog is supposed to be with you 24 hours a day for a reason and like you said, what happens if you have a seizure and the dog is not with you This is not a good idea. The service dog is your responsibility And you\u2019re his responsibility you\u2019re supposed to be a team.\n\nI would say no and your mom should not think you should play nice to keep your sister happy. If your sister is so hell-bent on making sure that her daughter is safe while she goes to the mall, she herself should get a service dog for her daughter, and not try to borrow yours. She also has the option to go to the mall with her, but your service dog is not an option.", "NTA\n\nBy your sister's logic surely her daughter can manage without a dog for only a few hours.\n\nThe money you spent to train your dog is immaterial.

It is Your service dog. The dog that you paid $15,000 for. Your sis & other family members are being entitled AHs who obviously don't care about you.

People are unpredictable and most teenagers are still learning how to assert themselves and enforce boundaries, while other teenagers are dead set on seeing how many buttons they can push and what they can get away with. Your niece has not had to save up for years for this dog, she has not had to deal with applications or waiting lists, and as a child she still has the protection and assistance of her parents for the next few years. You've put in the work and as an independent adult you'll suffer more than embarrassing outings if something happens to the dog or interferes with their training. If nothing bad happens this time they will almost surely ask again..The answer is no. The dog is prescribed to you and undergone expensive training to recognize and assist with your cues. Don't offer alternatives, don't feel like you need to help, this is your sister's issue to solve and if she feels her daughter would be well served by a service dog she should invest in one. It's low for her to bring up the assistance you needed when you were younger when it likely did not come from her pocket, especially as your service dog has probably granted you some independence and what she's suggesting may compromise that.", "What?!
