If you are willing to listen to us despite we are being mean you are good gal.", "You're embarrassed because your friends look down on you for dating someone in college so you try to make dress what you think is appropriate for a college student? All I'm seeing is you trying to control a part of his life that he uses to express himself. if you don't like his clothes there's a good chance you think his interests are immature too.

You are the one afraid about what people think and feel insecure that people might see him as childish. \n\nYou are the one who has growing up to do here, not Jack, because your fear of being looked down on isn't going to go away even if Jack changed his whole wardrobe. You'd just always end up targeting something else like his eyebrows or his hair or how often he shaves or whatever else you think your friends might complain about.\n\nJack is confident in who he is and what he likes, you are not, and are unfairly taking that out on him.

Are YOU bothered by him being in school? It sounds like it. If you take a hard look and you aren\u2019t bothered by it maybe take inventory of your friends and why you allow them to say these things about your boyfriend you say you love.
