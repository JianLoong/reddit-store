It\u2019s so generous of you to offer to be her full-time caretaker. I\u2019ve already gotten the paperwork ready to sign everything over to you and get her moved in, so you\u2019ll just need to let me know what date is good.\u201d", "NTA at all, and what's most worrisome is your aunt may be upsetting your parent when she visits, giving her caretakers grief etc. That will do nothing to make your parent's life easier or better. And her comments criticizing you for not caring for your parent at home were disgraceful and uncalled for. You have nothing to apologize to anyone for, your aunt least of all.\n\nI do believe it's relevant that your aunt never had to do this for her parents, but even lack of similar experience in no way makes her callous lack of understanding and empathy excusable.\n\nBy all means, ban her. Harsh as it is to say this, your parent probably won't realize the difference.", "I have a friend whose mom had Alzheimers and he was constantly worried that she would again turn on the stove and walk away, forgetting it, or go for a walk and wander away, all kinds of things she did.  He paid for a nurse while he was working, but that meant he had to go food shopping and leave her alone, and he never could socialize.  She came down with pneumonia and now she's in a nursing home, plays cards with others, socializes, and she's much happier.\n\nYou can't keep your mom at your home, you have to work and have teenagers to drive to their activities.  If your aunt feels so strongly about it, why isn't she volunteering to have your mom there, she's probably retired.  I'm sure this was an extremely difficult decision (like it was for my friend), please don't feel you did the wrong thing, and you are NTA for telling your aunt to stop with the comments.", "NTA\n\nCaring for someone with Alzheimer's is a 24/7 job.  In a facility, people care for her in shifts, so they can, you know, sleep, eat, shower, etc.  Insisting that one person handle the job of three is incredibly thoughtless and short-sighted.  She can armchair quarterback all she wants, but unless she's willing to step up and volunteer as your mother's full-time caretaker, she can hit the road and keep her yap shut.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve seen Alzheimer\u2019s to the end of life in my family. I\u2019m so sorry you have to experience this. \n\nDo what you need for YOURSELF right now. As the POA, you have all the burden and need to be in the best place mentally and emotionally you can be. You do not have to room to deal with unsolicited negative opinions. \n\nDepending on what stage, your parent may or may not recognize your aunt, so your aunts presence could be of little to no value to you parents current quality of life. \n\nIt clearly sounds that your aunt is detrimental to your quality of life, and you don\u2019t need that right now.", "NTA - I'm so sorry you're dealing with all of this. I know your situation, and it is NOT easy by any means. Stick to your guns, this is a good decision for your parent and if the place where they are starts to become a problem, you can always move them. I think choosing a place that was recommended by a social worker was a good idea.\n\nTell your aunt that if she's so concerned about the place, she should move to where you live and take care of your parent full-time.", "NTA- not everyone is able to care for those with alzheimer's its better those trained and knowing of the condition to do it.", "NTA I tried caring for someone with Alzheimers at home and it turned out to be a well meaning but bad choice for all involved. Your Aunt has no clue and may be getting Alzheimers herself which is clouding her judgement. Try not to dwell on it because it will eat you alive.", "NTA\n\nPeople not dealing with a loved one with Alzheimer\u2019s have no idea the toll it takes, the cost, the stress, the time, the anxiety, etc. She can f*ck all the way off.", "You WBTAH of you ban your aunt from seeing your Mom.  Your aunt has no clue what levels of care Alzheimers entails.  Maybe your aunt can't accept how sick your mother really is.  Since she does care about your Mom, it wouldn't be right to deny visits.\n\nYou would NOT be the AH for cutting off phone calls to you.  You have done your best to get your Mom the right care.  No one can manage Alzheimers at home without a team of help, especially in the later stages.  Your priority and attention has to go to the kids you are raising.  You haven't neglected your Mom at all.  Your Mom is getting round the clock care from trained staff.  You can't neglect your kids because you are the only option for them and if you break down, so does their world.", "NTA. Please get connected with a caregiver support group. [The Alzheimer\u2019s Association](http://www.alz.org) is an incredible org and they have online and in person options.", "NTA EVER. I lost my father to that vicious disease. Caring for him in the end took 4 family members almost full time. A home a good home is the best place for you parent. Her head is up her A. Real far.", "NTA. First, I'm so sorry about your parent. Alzheimer's Disease is terrible--my father had it--and caring for people with it is a full-time job. Even if you didn't have a full-time job and teenagers, these people need care from people equipped to care for them. \n\nYour aunt doesn't understand how cruel her words are. It's easy to say what others should do, especially when it doesn't affect you. Just a few days ago, I read they found the body of a man with dementia who had wandered off years ago. His family never knew what happened to him. You are doing the right thing.", "NTA and I commiserate with you. My step-father (more like my Dad to me) has Alzheimer's and my Grandfather (my mother's father) did, too. I am several states away from my parents, but had been the main voice in encouraging my mom to get help and coaching her along the day (lots of trauma from caring for her father after my grandmother abandoned him). Anyway, you are the one dealing with your mother 24/7 and you have the power of attorney and assuming medical proxy, you know best what her day to day needs are and what you are capable of. If you aunt wants to take over her care, by all means she can, though I don't know that that's the right thing to do for your mother, who is probably somewhat settled (as much as one can be when suffering this disease) in her home and moving her might be too big of a disruption to her, and also is your aunt actually capable of handling her. I would doubt it. \n\nYou had every right to say what you said, but you could also sit down with her and detail all of her issues and all of her needs and so on, and the next steps in the disease if she is not aware of all of them. I bet it's a lot to process for her. She's stunned seeing her sister in this state, you are feeling the strain of being the primary caretaker / in charge of her care. It's an emotionally charged situation, and I hope you two can get on the same page soon.", "NTA. Of course she wants the best for her sister and you have made the best decision possible for your mother given all the factors involved, about which your aunt is clueless. Unless they have been there, NO-ONE gets how difficult it is to be in your situation. You needed to get her in check and used the only leverage you have. I hope she'll toe the line so you won't have yet another awful decision to make. You have my sympathy, OP.", "NTA, you need to keep your sanity to be able to provide this care facility for your parents. Getting a guilt trip from the aunt does not help the situation. Invite her to vent her feelings on the matter to a therapist, but you are not required or paid to listen.", "NTA  \nYou want her to get the best, safest care possible. That's not your home - and you've already researched to find the best possible place.  \nWhat they needs from you, is your best possible love - and you are much better placed to give it when the specialists are taking care of the care stuff, and you have the space to focus on being the loving daughter.  \nWhat they doesn't need is a sibling stressing them out, worrying them, upsetting them.  The sibling is probably frightened herself, and distressed, but she has to keep that to herself.  Displaying that, or pushing that fear into your parent's environment is not the best care they can have.  If you need to ban them, for the good of everyone, then, harsh as it may feel, you need to ban them.  You were the one given POA for a reason (or several).  \nKia kaha.", "NTA. Tell you\u2019re aunt if it\u2019s so important to her, she can take care of your mom in her house full time without any assistance.", "NTA. No one who has ever dealt with Alzheimer's or just parent/elder care would ever judge you. Her comments are unnecessary not helpful. She can take that as a warning and change her behavior", "YTA, for the threat of banning her. Guilt trip or not, your parent should not be a bargaining chip. \n\nYour aunt didn\u2019t unload on you until you pressed her and you feel guilty because part of you agrees with her. \n\nNot everyone can care for a loved one that needs memory care, I get it. I have a parent with a similar future. \n\nYour aunt is going through many emotions and some she may not process well. Like her eventually getting the same disease or wanting better for her sibling and not being able to personally provide it. You get the brunt of the anger because you are the bad guy that made the necessary decision. Own it and understand being power of attorney is thankless job. \n\nYou could offer to let her take care of your sibling. \n\nAt the end of the day - you were in the wrong for using your parent as a bargaining chip to get your aunt to shut up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Professionals are more skilled in deflection and finding ways to get the resident (as they currently are, not who they used to be) taken care of in the best way available to them.
