And her comments criticizing you for not caring for your parent at home were disgraceful and uncalled for. You have nothing to apologize to anyone for, your aunt least of all.\n\nI do believe it's relevant that your aunt never had to do this for her parents, but even lack of similar experience in no way makes her callous lack of understanding and empathy excusable.\n\nBy all means, ban her. Harsh as it is to say this, your parent probably won't realize the difference.", "I have a friend whose mom had Alzheimers and he was constantly worried that she would again turn on the stove and walk away, forgetting it, or go for a walk and wander away, all kinds of things she did.

She came down with pneumonia and now she's in a nursing home, plays cards with others, socializes, and she's much happier.\n\nYou can't keep your mom at your home, you have to work and have teenagers to drive to their activities.  If your aunt feels so strongly about it, why isn't she volunteering to have your mom there, she's probably retired.  I'm sure this was an extremely difficult decision (like it was for my friend), please don't feel you did the wrong thing, and you are NTA for telling your aunt to stop with the comments.", "NTA\n\nCaring for someone with Alzheimer's is a 24/7 job.

Stick to your guns, this is a good decision for your parent and if the place where they are starts to become a problem, you can always move them.

Alzheimer's Disease is terrible--my father had it--and caring for people with it is a full-time job. Even if you didn't have a full-time job and teenagers, these people need care from people equipped to care for them. \n\nYour aunt doesn't understand how cruel her words are.

My step-father (more like my Dad to me) has Alzheimer's and my Grandfather (my mother's father) did, too. I am several states away from my parents, but had been the main voice in encouraging my mom to get help and coaching her along the day (lots of trauma from caring for her father after my grandmother abandoned him). Anyway, you are the one dealing with your mother 24/7 and you have the power of attorney and assuming medical proxy, you know best what her day to day needs are and what you are capable of. If you aunt wants to take over her care, by all means she can, though I don't know that that's the right thing to do for your mother, who is probably somewhat settled (as much as one can be when suffering this disease) in her home and moving her might be too big of a disruption to her, and also is your aunt actually capable of handling her. I would doubt it. \n\nYou had every right to say what you said, but you could also sit down with her and detail all of her issues and all of her needs and so on, and the next steps in the disease if she is not aware of all of them. I bet it's a lot to process for her. She's stunned seeing her sister in this state, you are feeling the strain of being the primary caretaker / in charge of her care. It's an emotionally charged situation, and I hope you two can get on the same page soon.", "NTA. Of course she wants the best for her sister and you have made the best decision possible for your mother given all the factors involved, about which your aunt is clueless. Unless they have been there, NO-ONE gets how difficult it is to be in your situation. You needed to get her in check and used the only leverage you have. I hope she'll toe the line so you won't have yet another awful decision to make.

That's not your home - and you've already researched to find the best possible place.  \nWhat they needs from you, is your best possible love - and you are much better placed to give it when the specialists are taking care of the care stuff, and you have the space to focus on being the loving daughter.  \nWhat they doesn't need is a sibling stressing them out, worrying them, upsetting them.  The sibling is probably frightened herself, and distressed, but she has to keep that to herself.  Displaying that, or pushing that fear into your parent's environment is not the best care they can have.  If you need to ban them, for the good of everyone, then, harsh as it may feel, you need to ban them.  You were the one given POA for a reason (or several).  \nKia kaha.", "NTA.

She can take that as a warning and change her behavior", "YTA, for the threat of banning her. Guilt trip or not, your parent should not be a bargaining chip. \n\nYour aunt didn\u2019t unload on you until you pressed her and you feel guilty because part of you agrees with her. \n\nNot everyone can care for a loved one that needs memory care, I get it. I have a parent with a similar future. \n\nYour aunt is going through many emotions and some she may not process well. Like her eventually getting the same disease or wanting better for her sibling and not being able to personally provide it. You get the brunt of the anger because you are the bad guy that made the necessary decision. Own it and understand being power of attorney is thankless job. \n\nYou could offer to let her take care of your sibling. \n\nAt the end of the day - you were in the wrong for using your parent as a bargaining chip to get your aunt to shut up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are treating her well by putting her there.\n\nI put mine in assisted living.  She wasn\u2019t physically combative, just verbally ugly and mean, but I HAD to work full time, and she needed care I couldn\u2019t provide.  She was a very difficult woman who had a hard time keeping friends, and she would not have been happy in our home.", "Side question: why are so many people referring ot OPs parent as their mom? Where was a gender given? Genuine question.", "NTA.  Your aunt is refusing to respect your boundaries and see your lens.  If she cares so much, she can take care of your parent.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through though \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA people always think they know better when they don't have to do the hard work. Alzheimers isn't an easy thing to work with, even if it is non-combative. My FIL fell at night bc he started roaming, thank God he was in a facilitie where they could give him immediate medical attention! you can't be awake and alert for 24/7, sadly a home is almost always the only solution in the end.", "NTA but under no circumstances should you even consider banning your aunt, you have a duty of care to your mother which in this case means allowing your unreasonable aunt to have contact with her sister. Your mother would want to see her and that\u2019s all you need to think about.", "I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. The reality of Alzheimer's is that patients need intensive, specialized care that can't usually be provided at home by family members. If your aunt was actually around more, she'd realize how badly your parent needs the round-the-clock professional care. NTA at all.", "NTA.  I had a similar Aunt, my Mother took care of my grandfather/her father while he had Parkinson's and the decline was quite swift.  Aunt never saw the bad days, never saw when he pulled out a knife, when he got furious because he didn't know where he was.  She just told us how bad a job we were doing.  \n\nWe went away for 2 weeks and she had to be the pseudo caregiver (visiting for a few hours everyday) for those 2 full weeks.  She understood after that and no longer complained.  People who don't see this stuff up close and first hand frankly don't get an opinion on it.  Its heartbreaking and very difficult.", "ESH. Your aunt, obviously, for her attitude  though clearly she is grieving and not really understanding how inpractical and dangerous to your parent it wiuld be to have her at home without 24/7 care from professionals. And you for threatening her with not seeing her sibling ever again just for having an, albeit annoying, opinion. That's so harsh.", "NTA\n\nYour last comment is spot on - she has no idea what it is like. Alzheimers is an awful thing for both the person and their loved ones. It requires skilled nursing that most people just can't provide at home. \n\nAsk your Aunt if she is willing to pay for at home, 24/7 nursing for your Mother and if not, then shut up.", "NTA - Please know that you are doing the best you can and you are doing right by your parent.", "I think this is really all about guilt for your aunt.  You said yourself that she lives across the country and doesn't get to visit much, and I suspect that's left her with a good amount of guilt about her lack of support for her sibling.\n\n You know how overwhelming and exhausting and stressful caring for a patient with Alzheimer's can be, and some people just aren't equipped to process those feelings in a healthy way.  It's a lot easier for her to blame you for not making sure your parent is okay than it is to face the fact that she isn't strong enough to be there more or make the tough decisions or watch someone that she loves change irrevocably and probably forget her.  \n\nThat doesn't make her behavior okay, or mean that you should tolerate it.  You are already on the front lines and making the hard choices, and you are not responsible for her feelings or her grief, but I wanted to offer a little perspective in case it's easier to dismiss her vitriol if it's actually just fear and guilt and sadness being masked.  \n\nGrief is hard.  NTA, of course, but I hope things go better between you for all your sakes.", "Wouldn't it make more sense to ask the care home staff to have a chat with your aunt the next time she visits. They can explain to her exactly what's it like to look after someone with alzeimers and what problems it causes. I certainly wouldn't do as someone suggested and offer to let your aunt take her. If aunt said yes and did start making arrangements to move your mum what on earth would you do. It could cause your mum more distress, totally unnecessarily.", "Do not doubt yourself OP you are absolutely NTA. It's fine for people to judge sitting on the sidelines, but unless they are in your situation they have no idea of what caring for someone with any form of dementia entails. My father had Parkinson's and in his last year there was absolutely no way we would have been able to care for him at home as his dementia developed and he became combative. My poor mother was wracked with guilt but even she knew that he was in the best place for him and for her.", "NTA\n\nShe is grieving the loss of the sister she knew, she is facing her own old age and mortality, and she feels guilty she can't/won't help more.\n\nNone of that makes it fair that she is taking it out on you.", "In another thread I learned what your aunt is. A seagull relative. Swoops in, squawks loudly, suits all over, flies away.  \n\nIgnore her squawks.", "You have my deepest sympathies.\n\nNTA in the past few years my wife has lost 3 of her Grandparents to dementia and Alzheimer's, and her mother to dementia, cancer and a stroke. My wife was caregiver to her Grandmother and Mother before they passed, and as much as she loved them it was terribly hard on her. They both became very aggressive in their language to her calling her horrible things and they did the same with care givers we would have come in to work with them. It was pretty rough having to move them to skilled nursing when the time came. When my wife visited them there she always cried when she came out after the visits even if the visits were good. Because she blamed herself for not being able to care for them all the way to the end. Sometimes it's nearly impossible to do it without setting up special equipment in your home like hoyer lifts and having a large enough area to get these items into bathrooms and bedrooms. Both her mother & grandmother lost the ability to walk. Had no control of their body functions and were in the 200lb range so moving them was difficult even for me. \n\nAunt doesn't want to realize what it takes because she's afraid it will be her in a couple of years & she doesn't see the amount of strain it would put up on your home & family. You are doing your best for everyone involved and she can either get with the program, or begone.", "NTA. Not even close.", "Maybe if OP didn\u2019t care, that would be something to teach auntie a lesson. But OPs mom deserves the best and safest care possible, another elderly woman with that much ego and ignorance can\u2019t provide it. Mom is the one who would suffer for a stunt like that.", "As someone who has had to hear horror stories from my parents about my great grandma who had dementia ( which is similar to alseimers in many ways)   op is NTA , it is impossible for one person to be the caretaker of someone who is going through this because not only does it wear you down mentally but the person themselves becomes a danger to you and themselves as they may get upset and attack you or unintentionally harm themselves. If I where op I'd ban the aunt now as she's 100% doing more harm than good in this situation for her sister.", "Watched a 90-year-old go through this with his spouse recently.  She did not recognize him and was afraid of him.  The last time I saw her, she needed help finding her way out of the restroom. :(\n\nI will never judge anybody for deciding to escalate care for their spouse with Alzheimer's", "The social life is a great point. In a nursing home, she's seeing other, at least to some extent. Which is better for her than being stuck at home with only OP.\n\n*And she's safe*. There's nothing she can really hurt herself or others with, her needs are met by trained professionals, and she's being monitored at all hours. It's the best environment for sure", "> *your aunt may be upsetting your parent when she visits*\n\nMy mother was in a facility with Alzheimer's.  These patients have different degrees of lucidity on different days.  The last thing that mom needs is to hear negative trash talk from her sister on a day when she might understand it. \n\nBan her, and don't look back.  u/Libba_Loo nailed it when she called her remarks \"disgraceful and uncalled for.\"\n\nI'm so sorry that you have to deal with Aunt Nasty when there is already to much on your plate, OP.\n\nNTA", "My family tried to keep my father out of a nursing home after my mother died, but it ended up being too much. He had been a very active man and a normal house couldn't safely contain him when he wanted to wander. \n\nThe effort of supervising him as well as children nearly broke up my sibling's marriage, especially since he no longer recognised his grandchildren so he got upset about strange kids in the house.\n\nIt's too much for most families. NTA.", "This right here.  Perfectly put.", "I am sorry about your father.  Thanks for your kind words, and thanks for giving grace to your mom. It is very hard.", "Disagree. Aunt is clueless and likely to upset Mom. SHe has no tact and this is not about her. It's about keeping mom comfortable.", "Having seen this 100 times with families,  the best thing is for op to require the aunt to take counciling to understand what she is saying.  Have a meeting with her care team coordinator.  But I don't have the patience she'd be banned that day.", "She should not be lashing out at the caregiver who is already worn out.", "Hugs to you. I am sorry.", "I am sorry you\u2019ve experienced this too. This is one instance where misery does not love company. I wish no one had to deal with this. Thanks for the kind words. I am going to start calling her Aunt Pigeon!", "I appreciate your POV but just to clarify, she was keeping her WORDS to herself, not her feelings. Her upset was clear. Lots of passive aggressive sighs, etc.", "People who have never been a care taker to someone suffering from sever dementia likely don\u2019t understand how hard/impossible it is to take care of them in their home. OP\u2019s mom likely doesn\u2019t even know who OP or the aunt is most of the time if at all. A facility is the best place hands down for OP\u2019s mom.

Hugs back.", "I am sorry for your situation. The guilt is brutal. Thanks for the kind words.", "Unlikely. If OP'S parent remembers their sibling(s) at all, it's probably as they were 30/40/50 years ago, and who the hell is this old woman claiming to be their sister? \n\nMy own mother was absolutely certain that when her parents came back from Hawaii, they were going to take her home to the ranch and really give us an ass-whoopin' for being so mean to her. She'd forgotten that her parents had died decades ago. She'd even forgotten that her husband of 72 years had died. When she fretted about where he was, we answered \"Didn't you say he went to the hardware store? You know what men are like at a hardware store.\" And she cheerfully agreed.", "I have a friend whose mom had Alzheimers and he was constantly worried that.", "Saying this is to prove a point not to actually give her to the Aunt. Reality is these types of people LOVE to criticize and say what the other person *should* do but 99% will NEVER actually be willing to step up and do things themselves or just don't realize the full extent of the situation due to ignorance or delusion.", ">But OPs mom deserves the best and safest care possible, another elderly woman with that much ego and ignorance can\u2019t provide it.

Sharing stories of the past, pictures, even music would bring him back some. Seeing my mom brought him back a lot. They divorced so many years ago but she still cared for him. Despite her aging, he knew her face and who she was. A lot of times he thought I was my sister, I just agreed with him. I think the familiar face may fire some synapses even if they don't completely understand", "I bought my grandmother fire saftey stove burners.

It was mostly me she was upsetting.", "You do understand that the Aunt's presence was negatively impacting OP who just had to put her parent in a home. It's a horrible experience and for someone to say that is completely out of line. I don't think OP should ban from visiting but as someone else said, just don't be present when the Aunt is there. It's a truly horrible experience and most people just do the best they can.", "Ok, so no reason to ban her visits. Just dont visit mom yourself when auntie is there", "I said to continue allowing the visits and just not be there.\n\nI have worked a lot with dementia patients actually,cso I probably know a good deal more about the situation than the average reddit user", "Cool, if that's the case your comment makes it worse. \nI'm glad you know so much about it but can't seem to understand the emotions that people go through making these types of decisions and why they act they way they do.  I thought your language was too harsh and didn't take into consideration that maybe it's not ego but guilt and sadness for feeling the way she is and the reaction she had. These are really tough times and people both OP and Aunt have high emotions running."]}
