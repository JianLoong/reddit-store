Your brother seems to take umbrage with taking care of your parents, you seem to take umbrage with him being the favorite beforehand.\n\nWhether he's justified in putting your parents in a care home or whether he's being an asshole depends a lot on how the parents treated him, how he treated them in the care home, what level of resources they need, how financially capable he is/how much they supported him in adulthood, and a ton of other factors. He would have to be exceptionally shitty on a number of counts to justify telling him he's an awful person and hopefully his son doesn't grow up like him, especially because he *probably* doesn't buy into the idea his retirement plan should be his kids.", "INFO\n\nAre your parents unable to care for themselves?

You insulted him kinda out of nowhere. \n\nThere could be a million reasons why an old age home would have been better for them.

My grandma was great during the day but at night it got iffy, then she almost burned down the house when she tried to make lunch. The whole kitchen caught on fire. WFT wasn\u2019t a thing, no one could stop working and they couldn\u2019t afford to pay a care taker to be with her during the day. The old age home was the safest option for her. She also met a lot of people her own age and was a lot more social. Before the home she would never leave the house. \n\nYou may think an old age home is cruel but there are many situations where it isn\u2019t. The fact they couldn\u2019t just leave the home to go straight to you makes me assume they probably weren\u2019t at the level of function to be self sufficient and they needed the extra care. \n\nOutside looking in, you just dislike your brother and took a shot.", "Probably YTA. \n\nYou have given us no idea about what your parents were like when you were growing up, what their mental and physical state is now, how they've treated David and his wife, what David and his wife's living situation is... \n\nJust because you expect that David's going to \"take care\" of your parents doesn't mean he is obligated to do so.

This is a very different age. What the hell is he supposed to do with two elderly people when starting a family.\n\nLet me paint a picture.\n\nOlder they get, the more care is required, nappies, sheets, extra laundry. Forgetfulness, confusion, dementia and alzheimers can set in at any point. Which can lead to serious harm of other occupants when in confusion they can short circuit the mains. Set the house on fire. Harm themselves. Fall down and so on. \n\nThis is NOT for everyone.

Also your comment towards his child was totally unwarranted.", "YTA. You stated that your parents are capable and just want to live w your brother. Most people don't want their parents living with them just because. Especially when a new baby is coming into the picture. He's not obligated to be their room mate, and he's not obligated to help them out. He didn't decide to be born, ya know. AND, even if they weren't capable, depending on the disability, a home may be the better option to begin with. Not everyone is able to take on a caretaker role for their parent.\n\nETA if your parents are capable, how did your brother dump them into a home??", "YTA. \n\nThere was no need for you to insult your brother. Nor try to humiliate him for being your parents favourite and deciding to place your parents in a care facility for senior citizens unable to adequately meet their own healthcare needs unaided.\n\nYou could have just told your brother that you did not want to hear from him ever again and won't tolerate any contact attempts from either him or any members of his household under any circumstances.", "That escalated quickly from one event. I don't understand why you took this so personally. They wanted to live with him. He didn't want that. He found a way to have them cared for instead. \n\nDo they want to live with you? If no, then you need to apologize to your brother. If yes, then I'd be curious why he did t reach out to you first. \n\nYTA", "I swear this is a repost", "Personally, I agree with David. He doesn\u2019t own your parents anything.\n\nNone of us ask to be born. Our parents choose to have/keep us and then: Puft! Here we are.\n\nBUT, it also depends on how the care home he put them are. If he put them in a good one, you wanting to get them so you can finally try and gain their favor doesn\u2019t make him and ass.\n\nIf he put them in a shitty one, it all depends on how you both were treated as you grew up.\n\nEither way, YTA for acting like that when he was announcing his wife is pregnant.\n\nHis relationship to your parents isn\u2019t up to you to decide.

Everything was on a single level; she could walk everywhere in that building and outside.  The doorways were to code, and there were people around she could hang out with.

I would never dream of talking out of line to any of my siblings. Maybe OP is overwhelmed. It can be at times especially when you feel like the parent of your parents. While OP said he hadn't talked to his brother since the parents were placed in a home I can't fully place the title of tah on op. I think both brothers are on the edge of that title. If the oldest brother has no qualm about putting his parents in a home and go no contact long enough to call out of nowhere with the news of a new child then he's the AH. However. Op also had the option of calling his brother to ask for help when needed. So...he's kinda the AH too. \nY'all can work out a schedule. When my dad had to see a doctor out of town my sister would drive him. If it was in town I would. If I have something I need to do for myself my brother will keep them company till I'm back. Finding quality care for aging parents is difficult. OP if you are overwhelmed call your local chamber of commerce and see if they can give you some connections to agencies that offer at home help.

He doesn't owe them anything just because they chose to have a child.  There may be cultural expectations being Asian but he's well and truly been Americanised. \n\nDid your parents emigrate to the US before you were born and where are their parents?  Did they look after them?  Or was that left to a sibling back in the old country?\n\nDid your parents actually live in David's house with him?  Or did they just live near him?\n\nThe thing that you don't know is what the relationship was actually like.  Your parents may not have treated him very well and he may well not have wanted to be treated as the golden child because he was thinking of you and what you were missing out on.\n\nDo you have kids?  Do you expect them to look after you?\n\nIs there a particular reason you haven't taken your parents in if you feel that incensed about this.  Sure you may live in a different state but you could also move them to you from their care home?  And just exactly what are their care needs?  David is still really young and perhaps both him and his wife need to work so they can afford their house and now children but your parents have a very high care need which would be better served in a dedicated facility with the right equipment rather than someone having to quit work to do that.  It's also hard to be a 24/7 care giver.  Would you take that on yourself?  Because if you won't then you can't expect someone else to do it.  You could also have offered some respite to see just how hard it is.\n\nPerhaps David did try and say something and you wouldn't listen seeing as you have this idea that him being the oldest, it's his obligation.\n\nAnd if they are at a care facility, then it's probably needed as you can't just go into one.  And if you can afford a really good one, then I'm not seeing an issue.  Perhaps David would rather visit his parents often and not be the one to wipe their arses and attend to the rest of their personal care needs.\n\nI suspect that David is already planning for his advancing care needs (financially) as he doesn't expect his kids to care for him.  He'd probably rather have a good relationship and good enough so that they want to spend time with him (even if he is in a home) rather perhaps treat him like your parents might've through guilt and manipulation.", "NTA but your brother sure is.", "NTA Since you are Asian.

I saw people in the comments saying that it's not the kids' obligation to take care of parents and OP's brother should not be shamed of it.\n\nI mean, if we're talking about obligation, parents did those things for their kids not because they're obligated, it became their responsibility the moment their kids were born and it's because they care for them. I personally think that the mindset of people saying they don't owe shit to their parents is bullcrap.", "YTA\n\nHe is correct. He technically does not needs to take care of your parents. Of course, adult children end up taking care of their parents out of love and respect but it isn't a requirement.\n\nYou mentioned that your brother was the favorite.
