The only problem I have with the friend group is that most of the people there are from the same school, whereas I am from a whole different school. Not that big of a deal, we can still chat and make the friendgroup work. But a LOT of the times they only talk about the school they're at, what happens there, what they do together and trash talking some of the teachers. It's pretty funny, not gonna lie, but it's also really hard for me to keep up with the group chat and it's even harder to infiltrate myself in the chats they have because most of the time I have no idea what they're talking about and I also don't personally know their teachers. I might be the asshole for this which I can totally see why. I've tried to overcome the jealousy I get from being in a different school and not being able to spend my time with them multiple times but it's hard. I'm not sure what to do, I'll gladly accept if I'm the asshole in this case but I really really need to know.

It's very normal to talk with your school friends about funny stuff that happens there and talking trash about the teachers you don't like, but I do feel kind of sad that they don't try to include me too. So I thought it would be a good idea to ask reddit if me leaving the friend group would be an asshole move or not.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you've never expressed to them how you feel and that you feel left out, then I think you should. But, if you have and then they continue definitely not the asshole. But at the same time, you're allowed to leave a friend group if you feel left out. \n\nBut if you haven't explained to them that you feel left out and plus you like them and think it's funny, then I wouldn't leave. \n\nI'm in a group chat with friends from high school (I'm 18 and just graduated last May) and most of them work at the same place where as my ex and I work in the same place. (He helped me get the job while we were together. No, he hasn't done anything to endanger my job, the opposite actually.) And when they talk about work I just ask for more details to better understand. \n\nAnother thing is sending memes helps a lot to, which is easy cause ours is on IG. Even if yours is on a different platform, you still could do that, you just have to use links like YT clips.", "NAH.
