It\u2019s been a year since the first post, and in honor of my son turning one today I thought I\u2019d give you all a little update!\n\nFirst, my baby shower went off without a hitch. My ex stepmother ended up backing out at the last second due to her own personal problems at the time, and she convinced me to invite my parents. For the most part they behaved, don\u2019t know if they were completely sober at the time but my aunt and brother kept an eye on them. \n\nSecond, my son was born May 16th at 9lbs 15oz and 21in long. He\u2019s such a healthy beautiful baby I couldn\u2019t be prouder. For those who had a concern about my mental health: while I still struggle I\u2019ve been taking my medication, continuing therapy and leaning on family. \n\nMy mom still hasn\u2019t met her grandson. I have a strict rule stating no drugs, and you have to be completely sober around my son. They thought I was joking till I blocked them; my dad is currently 6 months sober. Mom is leaving for a sober house today. I\u2019m proud of the first step. \n\nLastly, I want to thank everyone in the last thread. Your energy and thoughts carried with me throughout the party and it ended up being amazing. Thank you all!", "created_utc": 1684348904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kaadg/update_aita_for_not_inviting_my_mom_to_my_baby/", "score": 45, "replies": [">9lbs 15oz and 21in long\n\nGOOD GRIEF GIRL!

Good grief! Congratulations on that baby of yours!   \n\n\nI haven't read your original post, but glad you had good progress with the situation.", "Lol I had a 20 hour labor - 7 hours in I asked for an epidural, 15 hours later I had to have a C-section cause his big head got stuck. Whoever said the first baby is the best, lied and I just wanna have a talk.", "It definitely took some arguing, cold shouldering, and lots of discussions, but I\u2019m happy they\u2019re on a better path. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m on a better path; I had no no desire for a \u201cbetter life\u201d because I was comfortable. With my son, I\u2019m now going to school and am ready to quit my job so I can spend time with him (my husband has a very high paying job so we can fortunately afford it).", "I don\u2019t think they did. My ex stepmom is a very strong willed woman, it\u2019s what drew me to her when we first met. My parents had known her for years before I was born and I think my mom felt betrayed. That and my siblings and I treated her friend more like a mother figure.\n\nShe had very personal reasons for not attending and I accepted it because as much as I wanted her there, her own grand babies needed her more.", "Nearly 10 pounds and that was your first baby?? Wow, that's honestly amazing. Your oven cooks well! So glad you made it through ok, but I'm sure that was not the funnest day of your life. :)", "It was not! I was chilling for a bit after they broke my water, then he wanted to try to exit before I even dilated fully. His dad is 6\u20193 ish and nearly 200lbs so I expected a big baby; he\u2019s not having anymore though. \ud83d\ude43", "Can't say I blame you - that's a huge baby!! Glad you're ok", "And he\u2019s even bigger now! I gained nearly 70lbs during pregnancy and I swear he took it all with him. He\u2019s currently 33lbs and longer than my torso. \ud83d\ude2d"]}
