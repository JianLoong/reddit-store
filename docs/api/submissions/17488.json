It\u2019s been a year since the first post, and in honor of my son turning one today I thought I\u2019d give you all a little update!\n\nFirst, my baby shower went off without a hitch. My ex stepmother ended up backing out at the last second due to her own personal problems at the time, and she convinced me to invite my parents. For the most part they behaved, don\u2019t know if they were completely sober at the time but my aunt and brother kept an eye on them. \n\nSecond, my son was born May 16th at 9lbs 15oz and 21in long. He\u2019s such a healthy beautiful baby I couldn\u2019t be prouder. For those who had a concern about my mental health: while I still struggle I\u2019ve been taking my medication, continuing therapy and leaning on family. \n\nMy mom still hasn\u2019t met her grandson. I have a strict rule stating no drugs, and you have to be completely sober around my son. They thought I was joking till I blocked them; my dad is currently 6 months sober. Mom is leaving for a sober house today. I\u2019m proud of the first step. \n\nLastly, I want to thank everyone in the last thread. Your energy and thoughts carried with me throughout the party and it ended up being amazing. Thank you all!", "created_utc": 1684348904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kaadg/update_aita_for_not_inviting_my_mom_to_my_baby/", "score": 288, "replies": [">9lbs 15oz and 21in long\n\nGOOD GRIEF GIRL!

Good grief! Congratulations on that baby of yours!   \n\n\nI haven't read your original post, but glad you had good progress with the situation.", "Lol I had a 20 hour labor - 7 hours in I asked for an epidural, 15 hours later I had to have a C-section cause his big head got stuck. Whoever said the first baby is the best, lied and I just wanna have a talk.", "It definitely took some arguing, cold shouldering, and lots of discussions, but I\u2019m happy they\u2019re on a better path. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m on a better path; I had no no desire for a \u201cbetter life\u201d because I was comfortable. With my son, I\u2019m now going to school and am ready to quit my job so I can spend time with him (my husband has a very high paying job so we can fortunately afford it).", "I don\u2019t think they did. My ex stepmom is a very strong willed woman, it\u2019s what drew me to her when we first met. My parents had known her for years before I was born and I think my mom felt betrayed. That and my siblings and I treated her friend more like a mother figure.\n\nShe had very personal reasons for not attending and I accepted it because as much as I wanted her there, her own grand babies needed her more.", "Nearly 10 pounds and that was your first baby?? Wow, that's honestly amazing. Your oven cooks well! So glad you made it through ok, but I'm sure that was not the funnest day of your life. :)", "It was not! I was chilling for a bit after they broke my water, then he wanted to try to exit before I even dilated fully. His dad is 6\u20193 ish and nearly 200lbs so I expected a big baby; he\u2019s not having anymore though. \ud83d\ude43", "Can't say I blame you - that's a huge baby!! Glad you're ok", "And he\u2019s even bigger now! I gained nearly 70lbs during pregnancy and I swear he took it all with him. He\u2019s currently 33lbs and longer than my torso. \ud83d\ude2d", "Congratulations! I just celebrated my first child's first birthday recently and I also have mental health issues so I totally get that feeling of pride and abundance of love, gratitude. I'm truly so happy for you. Shout out to your aunt and brother for protecting you <3 \n\nAnd you should be so proud of yourself for setting up difficult boundaries and sticking to them! I'm sure it was not easy and likely will continue to be challenging at times. And you're taking care of your health, putting your oxygen mask on first, which is wonderful and powerful. \n\nYou're doing great, mama - be proud and confident! Happy belated mother's day to you & happy belated birthday to your little one!", "Happy belated Mother Day to you as well! They grow fast and I need it to stop, it\u2019s getting to the point I can barely hold him \ud83d\ude2d", "Lol me too!\n\nI can't remember the exact birth weights of my kids, but my first was around 9.5 lbs and my second was only 2 or 3 ounces smaller than yours!\n\nI felt like a complete train wreck after my first. The second wasn't easy either, but I went from 7cm to 10cm in an instant (I literally felt a \"rip\" and was like \"I GOTTA PUSH **NOW**\"...nurse said \"I just checked you...\" but checked again and was like \"OH! BABY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW\" lol). Since the last part happened so fast, there was less trauma and I actually felt fine the next day. Nurses didn't believe me when I said I wasn't in pain, just a little discomfort. Go figure!", "Oh, it's likely the next ones will be worse- your body knows what to do now", "Thank you! sometimes I try to imagine I'm using my heart to hug my son when my arms are too tired lol", "I wish I had that warning! My son kept pushing when I was only 8cm, so when the nurse checked how dilated I was she said \u201cI can feel his head. I\u2019ll talk to the doctor since you\u2019re not ready.\u201d An hour later (mind you I was outta it with the epidural) dr came in and said \u201cready for your C-section?\u201d \u2026 WHAT C-SECTION MAAM???", "Yikes!\n\nYeah, the whole \"rip\" experience was...so weird. It didn't really hurt (or maybe it did, but not as much as contractions...I don't know lol) but the feeling was VERY disconcerting. And with the next contraction, it was literally like a switch had flipped. Before, I wasn't ready to push...after, it was like every fiber of my being knew and demanded that I push NOW. Really indescribable experience.", "Good job! Glad to hear it was a happy update. And welcome to the big baby club! My first was 9 lb. 12 oz in my second was 10 lb. 2 oz. My mother-in-law asked me when I was going to have a third and I told her when my husband grew uterus.", "I came out at 10 lbs and 3 ounces. My mother broke the bed during labor.", "My mom had me 20 years ago, when she was forty, and I was 9lbs 1oz when they weighed me. (My mom told me this.)", "My little brother was also 9lbs 15oz, not sure how long he was. The doctor had to dislocate my mom's hip because my brother's shoulders were so wide he got stuck on the way out. My mom didn't even realize it until they went to prepare her to put the hip back. \n\nYour little guy and I have the same birthday, which is cool \ud83d\ude0a. I hope he had an awesome birthday yesterday!", "I'm glad things are looking up! Did your ex stepmom meet your son already?", "What next ones? I told my husband I ain\u2019t having anymore \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "She\u2019s actually watched him a few times. She\u2019s busy with her own grandkids so it\u2019s been a few months, but we talk regularly.", "Lol! I feel you. I had a 10 pound 2 baby 1st time round that ended with a c-section for similar reasons to you. Got pregnant again and decided on a planned section, and insisted on them tying my tubes at the same time. No way am I doing that again!", "My Mom had a difficult birth with my older brother.  My Dad promised her that she never had to go through it again, my Mom agreed.

Fair play to you", "Jesus lol, must be quite a workout carrying him around! Congrats on the healthy baby.", "It is not fun. His pediatrician says it\u2019s normal since his dad is big, and he\u2019s a healthy baby. But still \ud83d\ude2d", "You must be super fit!", "I had one of those. Currently bigger than your hubby. Save money for food costs :)", "\u2026 I walk everywhere, does that count? \ud83e\udd23", "I asked my dad when they stop asking for food all the time, he said \"when they leave home\"....."]}
