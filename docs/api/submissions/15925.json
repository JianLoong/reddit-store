We were best friends and did everything together. I got a boyfriend (20M) my senior year and my friend got super jealous and started trashing him every chance she had. I asked her several times to stop and she never let up. My friend made me late to work because she wouldn\u2019t let me leave her house. After that I decided I didn\u2019t want to be friends with her anymore. \n\nThis was January 2022, I distanced myself because I was hoping to keep being friends but she decided on the anniversary of my grandma dying to blow up my phone saying that I was a piece of shit and telling me our friendship was over. Which I totally understood. I responded and said I understand her feelings and I was sorry our friendship was ending and I had asked her if she could please give me my class ring back. She had put it on her necklace when we went swimming and had forgotten to give it back. \n\nShe never responded which I understood for a few months but I thought enough was enough so I texted her mom, no response. I texted her 3 more times, nothing. I texted her mom 4 more times, crickets. So on my one day off I texted them both that I was in town and would like my ring now. Her mom texted back saying that my friend doesn\u2019t want to give it back and she wants to be buried with my ring so I can feel the pain she felt. I got pissed and called the police. I had the receipt, and my name was also ingraved on it. I got it back but everyone in my family was giving me a hard time because it was her birthday. I admit if I had remembered it was her birthday I would\u2019ve waited but the comment about her getting buried with my ring freaked me out.

You'd given her more than ample time to give the ring back she decided she wanted to steal it so he consequences are one her.", "Definitely NTA. Super immature to try and make you feel bad (when it's not even your fault imo) by making the death comment. Her MOM said that?? Well, I guess we know the apple doesn't fall far. You were right to cut your losses from someone so blatantly deceptive.", "NTA. Your former friend, enabled by her mother, FAFO. So what if it was her birthday?  Your family who are oh so sympathetic to that thief are AHs.", "NTA\n\nShe harassed your bf, held you against your will putting a job at risk, harassed you on a death anniversary,  and intentionally kept jewelry from you. That wanting to be buried with something so personal to you out of spite is downright creepy. You had every right to call the cops.\n\nDoes she have a history of stalking? Be careful if she continues the behavior file a restraining order. She for some reason is acted like a jealous jilted lover.", "NTA\n\nBirthday or not, had she just returned your ring nothing would have escalated.", "NTA By both of your admissions you aren't friends anymore, and she has been behaving awfully for years by now. As far as you're concerned she's a stranger and should give back what you asked for. Don't listen to her or her enabler mom's nonsense. You tried to be patient and reasonable far beyond what you should have.\n\nYeah it's not ideal it was her birthday, but it's ALSO NOT IDEAL SHE'S KEPT YOUR POSSESSION so long!", "NTA and honestly well played.", "NTA. It being her birthday was something you forgot, even if you remembered she had all the time in the World to give the damn ring back. She brought that to herself, from the start by not letting you have your own life. The timing is bad for you because you care for people. Also standing up for yourself is not being an AH, unless you do it as an AH. You didn\u2019t.", "NTA. You tried to play fair and even her mother was having none of it. And they gambled that you wouldn\u2019t escalate, which they lost. So it was her birthday. She harassed you on the anniversary of your grandmother\u2019s death.", "NTA and she got what was coming to her.", "NTA - your \"friend\" sounds a little unstable, as does her mother.  So, she got called out on her birthday and got embarrassed.  It was long overdue for the self-entitled, emotionally damaged little brat.\n\n She should've given it back to you, not proclaiming her pain through emotional blackmail (being buried with it). And she should have given it back to you when you requested and if her mother was a parent, should have ripped it from her grasp.\n\nGlad you got the ring back and let go of her.  Say \"good riddance to bad rubbish.\"", "NTA\n\nAnd it sounds like it might be a case of unrequited love. \n\nKeeping a class ring, that you never gave her, is a wild thing to do for a friend. And yes they are expensive.", "NTA? She wanted to be buried with it? WTF?", "NTA", "NTA what the actual fuck?", "NTA  go NC with your family.. they should be supportive of u.. in this situation", "NTA.", "NTA", "ESH. I don't know what in the name of Dale Earnhardt this hillbilly shit is, but you called the cops over a freakin' *class ring*. You don't think they have better things to do than get involved in your drama? You've spent years pretending to be friends while doing everything you can to make each others' lives miserable. It's embarrassing. You're both acting like children, at least she has the excuse of actually being one.", "YTA.

What\u2019s OP supposed to do? Go over to their house and physically take it? It doesn\u2019t sound like the teen got arrested so what\u2019s the big deal. A class ring is sentimental.
