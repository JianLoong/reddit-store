In general, the more safety nets I have, the less I perform. \n\nAlso, it's not \"free\", your dad is paying for it. \n\nOne thing I will say, is that the ADHD/depression combo often comes with perfectionism, so very often \"looking for\" something and initiating *anything* is hard, but going along with a plan that has been made is generally doable. My advice? Find a nearby therapist that works with ADHD adults and has decent reviews. Tell him you're making an appointment for him and that he's going. If he doesn't, you probably need to move on with your life.\n\nEven though I have it myself, a partner who refused to get treatment/medication for ADHD would be a hard dealbreaker for me.", "NTA.  This is a service that your dad pays for YOU to use.  Tell your bf that since your dad is paying for the service, talk to him about who can use it and is it considered a \"joint gift\".  Watch your bf back down on that real quick.\n\nYour bf is irresponsible.  You were generous enough to help him out once.  That should have been his wakeup call to get the service for himself since he is so forgetful.  If you keep solving his problems for him, he will have no incentive to help himself.", "NTA\n\nIt's not his service. \n\nYou seem to have a pretty good handle on how he is being manipulative. \n\nDude is 30 years old; he's got to get proactive about managing his condition. \n\nAnd having a backup plan for keys is actually a pretty easy one to solve. \n\nDon't buy into his self-created drama.", "NTA\nAs a neurodivergent person myself, your bf needs to find better ways to manage his needs. Eg he could attach his car keys to a stretchy type lanyard thingy and  attach the other end to his jeans so he can't get out the car without them (I don't drive so that might not work, but you get my jist). Or just buy his own AAA coverage to use. \n\nAs his partner, you can support him.  That's not the same as 'rescuing' him all the time.", "It\u2019s PRE-PAID, it is not free!

He should make duplicate keys for the door lock, give one to you, and keep one in his pocket, for future incidents. \n\nBut no, he is not entitled to your paid service just because he's careless.", "NTA... \"We\" do not have a free service.  You have a free service.  You do not want to waste your service for someone who is abusing it.  Your father bought it for you only.  If you bail him out, he will not learn.", "NTA he's not being rational right now. I have issues with ADHD and depression and it sucks because the depression can make thinking harder. It's a weird feeling that's unlike anything I've felt for other reasons. My husband will ask me if I want coffee and I just say \"I don't know\" and have to wait like 5 minutes before I can think about it. That doesn't make it your responsibility to take care of his issues. Yes, it sucks for him to have to pay when he technically has access to a service that's already paid for, but this is a consequence. People with mental health issues are also susceptible to consequences.", "NTA. It's your gift to use, not his. He's just frustrated, ADHD is difficult to live with. He really does need to learn some coping mechanisms and get help with depression.\n\nI've dealt with mental health issues, it can be scary just taking the first step in asking for help. I knew I needed therapy, but for some reason I was unable to make the appointment. I'm still not sure why, or what I was afraid of, but I just couldn't do it.\n\nMy partner recognized I was making excuses for never making the appointment and flat out asked me, in a supportive way, if I needed my hand held for this. I admitted I was weak, and he picked up the phone and scheduled my first therapy appointment. He even offered to take me to it and wait for me. I am grateful for his support and help. The first step is hard.", "NTA -   \n\n\nFirst, even though he may be a little neurodivergant, he's definitely being manipulative.  \n\n\nSecond, it's not free for \"us\", its a gift from your father to you, not him.  \n\n\nThird, dump him and find someone who will address their own issues and support you.", "NTA. I have ADHD too. But I don't use that as an excuse to mooch off someone else. That service isn't for both of you; it's for you. And he was manipulating you; he was guilting you. ADHD can be managed; he doesn't want to do the work though.", "NTA\n\n\nI believe with triple A the cardholder has to be on site. As in they will unlock his car when you are the passenger and can make the call. You can\u2019t just call and send them to your partner. I\u2019ve always had to hand them my card and my driver\u2019s license.  I\u2019ve been told I can even call for strangers (like a stranded motorist) as long as I\u2019m standing there to give them my info. \n\nI\u2019ve had AAA over twenty years.", "NTA.

I\u2019ve had AAA for years and each time I\u2019ve used it I\u2019ve had to show the card at the time the driver/service arrives. Meaning, you couldn\u2019t even help him if you wanted to. There is also a difference between supporting and enabling. He can get an extra key, get AAA, make that therapist appointment. It\u2019s just easier to call you and have you fix it for him or take it out on you if you refuse.", "ESH.\n\nDo you usually use 3 or more calls in a year? Or do they usually expire?\n\nIf you typically have 2 or more of your 4 free calls expire, it's better that these are put to good use instead. You could definitely negotiate with him that if a 5th call event happens to your car during the year, he's fully on the hook to pay for it. \n\nYou could also tell him you're more comfortable with him getting his own coverage (starting tomorrow) and in exchange for covering him today, he owes you a free call off of his account to make you whole again.\n\nHe shouldn't be going off on a wounded rant, but there were solutions here that you both could have used that treated him more like a partner.\n\nAlso, it's worth getting a spare set of car keys and putting them somewhere accessible (home, office) so a locksmith isn't required unless the situation is unusual.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its a sad situation. \n\nAAA is your insurance for emergencies.  Don't share it because you need it at the oddest times. Thats when emergencies happen.

But that means she has the inconvenience and time-sink of having to go physically to where he's at to bail him out.", "He needs his own AAA. AAA only covers the person who is on the membership (her). She can\u2019t just call the locksmith service from AAA and it\u2019s all handled. She has to be present every time a car needs to be unlocked by AAA or they won\u2019t cover the unlocking fee.

I have tried everything and all therapies but nothing has improved my memory. \n\nI don\u2019t have any solutions but please know you are not the poop-hole here.", "I generally fall into the \"don't 'mother' your partner\" camp, but I think there's a big difference between mothering him and doing what someone else suggested and helping him over one hurdle \u2013 in this case, finding a therapist or (perhaps better) psychiatrist. If I were you, and if I were not yet ready to walk away, I would find someone for him (someone who is in network, taking new patients, etc.), make an appointment, and then tell him about it. If he then refused to go and get help for his worsening and untreated ADHD and depression, I think that would tip me over the line and lead me to walk away.

You are not his mother and shouldn\u2019t have to nag him to find a therapist. This is your future if he doesn\u2019t get better. He will depend on you to remember stuff and fix his problems. \n\nJust something to think about.", "If this is truly a rough patch mentally, it might work out that once you get him into treatment he's actually able to go back to not needing your help.\n\nI will say, though, that the part where he accuses you of manipulating him is concerning. If he is actively resisting getting treatment (as opposed to being unmotivated/forgetful) then you definitely can't do much.", "He can get his own AAA service. He is a 30 year old grown man! Let him deal with it. As a woman who has \u201cmothered\u201d boyfriends and 2 husbands, i say please listen to your therapist.", "ADHD is a *disability*. Is pushing someone in a wheelchair \"mothering\"? Is holding the hand of a blind person mothering? \n\nIt's very easy to comprehend that people with physical disabilities need help with things that come naturally to others, but when it comes to ADHD, because the disability isn't visible, people don't see it the same way.", "I have ADHD and that might actually help me? Sometimes I forget to look stuff like that up, but if someone sends me a link I\u2019ll just do it", "It\u2019s very sad that he has uncontrolled ADHD but if he was able to use coping mechanisms to ensure he had his keys before and suddenly stopped that is a huge red flag. He will continue to do this if you enable him.", "Ah I see. Makes sense to ignore everything I said past NTA then. Hopefully things get better for you soon.", "I also have ADHD and I disagree that she should do the task of finding a therapist for him. Having help from a partner is helpful, sure, but there's a level of personal responsibility as well", "I agree with your point, but not your application. The real problem here isn\u2019t that he locks himself out of his car on a semi-regular basis (which, oof, I relate to hard having been dropped by my lockout service for using it too much because I also have adhd), it\u2019s that he responded to her not wanting to give him her \u201cfree\u201d lockouts by essentially pitching a manipulative, self hating tantrum. They aren\u2019t married. He has no reason to expect shared access or coverage. He can\u2019t put off getting treatment indefinitely while simultaneously demanding she utilize every last drop of her personal resources to compensate for his disability. The same way it is a wheelchair user\u2019s responsibility to plan for their own needs and request assistance and accommodations, he must also be accountable for his own executive functioning. This isn\u2019t a new problem. He has had lots of time to come up with work arounds, accommodations, and solutions that don\u2019t involve treating his girlfriend like a resource that is being withholding for merely wanting the chance to consent to giving assistance.", "You *just said* above that you perform less well with safety nets. So which is it?", "Not ignoring you. It's honestly not a bad idea to broach the subject with him again and see if he is more receptive to me helping him find treatment now.", "The safety net was in reference to the lockout service. \n\nI'm also (while I didn't put it this way) basically telling OP to say \"You get into therapy or I'm done with you\". Drastic consequences are the opposite of a safety net.\n\nI'm telling OP to make the appointment, I'm not telling OP to nag him and make him go the day of (a reminder is fine, but if he drags his feet that's on him). If, with an appointment set, he doesn't go, he's done. That's how I'd do it.", "Well good luck either way.", "Don't you see how putting this on OP is asking too much of a partner? This person holds down a job. Has an apartment. Has a car! Is ostensibly capable of doing things he *wants* to do. You're telling me that he literally **cannot** do this thing (which would more align with your blindness analogy), and so she has to do it for him?\n\nThe reality is, making this appointment does not align with his dopamine centers, and so his brain chooses not to do it. This is not OP's problem to fix. If her boyfriend cannot lift a finger to manage his own disability, then he shouldnt be in a relationship in the first place.", "I also think there's a big difference between a one-time help (*e.g.,* finding a therapist for him, since that seems to be a roadblock for him right now, and he's apparently been struggling badly since he started a downward spiral after an injury last year), and doing everything for him all the time.", "Exactly!"]}
