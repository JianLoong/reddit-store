I have a very important exam in a month and it basically decides my uni. A few hours ago, she took my phone again, and while I was mad, I didn't say anything.\n\nI went and laid in my room after a while because I was getting overwhelmed by the bright lights and sounds and was feeling nauseous. My mom asks me to have dinner and I told her I wasn't hungry. She thought it was a way of me rebelling against her for taking the phone and tauntingly gave me my phone back and asked me to come for dinner now. I explained to her that I was genuinely not hungry and I'm not rebelling against her or anything.\n\nShe got mad and started ranting about me in front of my dad (who has a very short temper) and my dad demanded that I shouldn't eat dinner from now on and my phone should be 'broken into pieces'. This ended up being a huge argument between my parents and escalated very quickly as my dad started blaming my mom for raising me horribly to be a brat and stuff. My mom asked me if I was happy for making them have a fight and I quietly went into my room without a word.\n\nShe comes to me, a few minutes later and asks me to choose between her and the phone. If I choose her, it would mean that I wouldn't receive my phone permanently and she would do a factory reset. I was quiet for a while before asking her if I could take a backup of my phone before giving it to her and she said no, and that I wouldn't get any electronic devices from now. I got mad and chose the phone instead and now she practically disowned me. She told me thatI was dead to her and that she wouldn't cook any food or have anything to do with me from now.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681063124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gqii3/aita_for_choosing_my_phone_over_my_mom/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
