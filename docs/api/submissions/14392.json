{"id": 14392, "submission_id": "12gqii3", "title": "AITA for choosing my phone over my mom?", "selftext": "My (17F) mom kept confiscating my phone whenever she saw me on it, despite me studying from it. I have a very important exam in a month and it basically decides my uni. A few hours ago, she took my phone again, and while I was mad, I didn't say anything.\n\nI went and laid in my room after a while because I was getting overwhelmed by the bright lights and sounds and was feeling nauseous. My mom asks me to have dinner and I told her I wasn't hungry. She thought it was a way of me rebelling against her for taking the phone and tauntingly gave me my phone back and asked me to come for dinner now. I explained to her that I was genuinely not hungry and I'm not rebelling against her or anything.\n\nShe got mad and started ranting about me in front of my dad (who has a very short temper) and my dad demanded that I shouldn't eat dinner from now on and my phone should be 'broken into pieces'. This ended up being a huge argument between my parents and escalated very quickly as my dad started blaming my mom for raising me horribly to be a brat and stuff. My mom asked me if I was happy for making them have a fight and I quietly went into my room without a word.\n\nShe comes to me, a few minutes later and asks me to choose between her and the phone. If I choose her, it would mean that I wouldn't receive my phone permanently and she would do a factory reset. I was quiet for a while before asking her if I could take a backup of my phone before giving it to her and she said no, and that I wouldn't get any electronic devices from now. I got mad and chose the phone instead and now she practically disowned me. She told me thatI was dead to her and that she wouldn't cook any food or have anything to do with me from now.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Thank you all for your responses. I'm going to try and reply to everyone's questions but I'll just put up a few points many have been asking about.\n\n\u2022I do not have any adult to talk to and I cannot stay anywhere else.\n\u2022We don't have a CPS here for these kind of situations.\n\u2022My parents *know* that I'm not doing anything illegal or weird on my phone. We've had a discussion about this and they told me that they trust me and know I don't do these things, but they don't like it when I study from my phone. Furthermore, my phone is monitored so they can see every single thing I'm doing on it.\n\u2022This isn't the first time we're having an argument about this. A while ago, my brother was scolded for using the phone too much for games and my dad suddenly demanded my phone be destroyed/confiscated. And to top it off, it wasn't even my phone he was using.\n\u2022I cannot stay in an on-campus university as my parents have barred me from it. They want me to go to a college where I can commute back and forth from home. I don't have money to pay for anything and my parents won't allow me to get a job.\n\u2022I do use my phone for YouTube at times but mostly it's for searching up recipes and food vlogs since I enjoy cooking. Again, my parents know that.\n\nEdit 2: Here are a few more points that are frequently being asked:\n\n\u2022I do not live in a country like the US or UK or any \"free\" countries. I live in a place where it is the norm for parents to be strict and traditional.\n\u2022I don't have means to escape even when I become an adult, so please understand that.\n\u2022 I've already graduated highschool and I have no counsellors or anything in my school. I'm currently on a break where I'm mostly studying for the various college entrances.", "created_utc": 1681063124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gqii3/aita_for_choosing_my_phone_over_my_mom/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
