She\u2019s obviously complacent or compliant with it since she decided to partially stick up for him, but if I were you I\u2019d be telling her that she isn\u2019t off the hook either and that it\u2019s partially her fault for letting it happen. You\u2019re inserted into the issue now, so might as well make sure everyone involved knows how they failed your niblings - and that includes your sister.", "In that case the sister needs to be a part of the time-out for for allowing this horrible behavior to go on, even after humiliating the family in public. We tend to give our family a pass when they don\u2019t necessarily deserve it and I think the sister is getting one here.", "So people get a pass for acting like a toddler because he might love the kids?", ">Pretty audacious of Stan to tell the kids' dad that he is committing parental alienation against him when Stan himself is trying to turn the kids against their own dad \n\nAh, that lovely power of Projection", "Exactly. She regrets not ending the relationship on better terms, yet she allows Stan to attack that same person? Yeah, she needs to answer for her continued allowance of Stan\u2019s bullshit. Her kids are suffering & she\u2019s letting it happen.", "Yes she does!\n\nI am certain if Stan gets to put a baby in her, he will then start treating the boys like crap, because \"they're not mine and they never accepted me\"! He seems to be just the type", "I'd not let him in my house anymore, is what", "OP needs to have a talk with his sister in private and OP needs to ask if she's scared of how Stan will react if she (sister) calls him out.\n\nIf he's like this in public I can only imagine how bad he is in private", "Im\nSorry whats a \u201cnibling\u201d", "NTA: That wasn't even harsh.", "NTAH.", "> my sister said I could have been less harsh.\n\nIf the sister in question here is the kid's mom, she's the asshole, to her kids, for letting this shit go as long as it has. She is allowing this dude's drama to cause problems for the family by not having been harsher sooner. What you said wasn't even that bad, and it sounds like it's been a long time coming. I mean, \"parental alienation\" gimme a fucking break. That's not what the term means at all, even if this dude was a parent to alienate, which he isn't.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "This is key. While it might have been possible to be nicer, what good would it have done? Stan obviously hasn't figured out how horrible he's behaving on his own, maybe a cold dose of reality will help. (I doubt it, but he doesn't deserve any coddling either way.)", "Why it\u2019s a gender neutral term?", "To be fair I do wonder if the sister is safe with Stan - can she tell him to knock it off or leave him or would doing so risk her physical safety and that of the kid's?", "It\u2019s a good consideration and the OP should ask sister that very thing before doing anything else.", "OP didn\u2019t mention anything about him not treating the sister well, but it\u2019s a good idea anyway for safety\u2019s sake.", "NTA. But I am wondering how your sister is handling all of Stan\u2019s rantings about how \u201chorrible\u201d her ex is and why she allows it to continue.", "If he's willing to treat everyone else like shit publicly who knows what he's willing to do behind closed doors.\n\nIt's worth establishing whether he's like this in private."]}
