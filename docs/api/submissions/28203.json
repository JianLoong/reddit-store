Since a couple of weeks before she was born my parents have been making plans to come to visit and meet her. They live about 14hr drive away. Every time something comes up or they can\u2019t get time off or it\u2019s too far to drive at the moment etc. \n\nFlights from their town to mine are very expensive, however, my sister (C) lives only 5hrs from me and flights from their town to hers are very cheap. Without asking me or my husband, my parents booked flights to visit C and texted me saying they would be at Cs house for 5 days (wed-sun) if we wanted to drive up there so they could meet baby. This was about 2weeks notice. \n\nI was upset that they are still not really making an effort to see N. And that they just expect us to drop everything and drive 5hrs there and 5hrs back with a baby. They don\u2019t want to do the drive because my Dad drives for work and doesn\u2019t want to do more driving on the couple of days he has off. \n\nI didn\u2019t reply for a few hours as I was upset and needed to talk to my husband and figure out if we would do it or not. My husband said it was ridiculous and if they actually wanted to visit they would, and we shouldn\u2019t have to drive 10hrs with a baby so they can meet him. Also note that husband is allergic to dogs and C has inside dogs and whenever we have visited in the past it\u2019s very uncomfortable for him, he has to wear long pants/sleeves the whole time even though its hot and he is constantly itchy and sniffling and his asthma is much worse.\n\nWe run our own business so have a bit of freedom with time but sat/sun/mon are all very busy days for us and we have to be home working. Thursdays I have something on in the mornings, so if we did drive there it would be 5hr drive thursday afternoon, friday there and 5hr drive back early sat.\n\nI called them back and tried to explain this and they basically told me that I need to put more effort in and they feel like I don\u2019t even want anything to do with them anymore. They brought up a bunch of things they\u2019ve done for me in the past and how they love me more than anything and would do anything for me and they were really excited about this because it was an opportunity for them to finally meet N and now they\u2019re sad and disappointed that it won\u2019t happen. \n\nThey didn\u2019t think a quick drive up for a few days would be a big deal and said \u201cI guess we should have asked first\u201d in a way that implied they can\u2019t believe they would have to ask if we were happy/this suited us before booking flights.\n\nThey made me feel like I was a massive AH but when I got off the phone my husband told me he thought they are the AH. So now I don\u2019t know but I still feel guilty and I know my parents are still upset and want me to drive up. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t drive to see them?", "created_utc": 1696414529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zjc9c/wibta_for_not_driving_10hrs_with_a_baby_so_my/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ridiculous to expect parents to drive with a newborn for 5 hours can\u2019t believe they\u2019re trying to trivialise that!

If they'd talked it over in advance, and given a couple of months notice, it might have been a viable compromise. But neither of these things happened.
