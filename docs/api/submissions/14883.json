He will get back in touch with you when he wants something else and his other enablers have gotten tired of him. NTA", "NTA.  He did some stupid stuff, and consequences ensued. I'm glad his father was able to help him, but it sounds like what he wanted from you was more than you were willing to do. And that's okay.  Bottom line, you didn't trust him to be responsible, and under the circumstances he didn't sound very trustworthy.  You don't have to risk more than you can lose to make another adult happy and save them from their own mistakes.", "NTA. You can't give what you can't afford to lose. He's demonstrated he's not responsible with cars & you couldn't afford to pay all the tickets if he did the same thing to your car. Also - of COURSE he should have paid the insurance if he was using the car. That's not him \"helping out\" It's common sense.", "NTA - and good job for not enabling stepson's poor choices. Hopefully this will be the wake up call for him to start growing up.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't trust someone like this to not get in trouble while using my vehicle. He needs to mature and prove himself responsible enough.", "He has a car.  He should use his car, and not take advantage of you.  Do you think that he is really going to change his habits with your vehicle?  Or has he already run into other issues with his car that he needs to beg you for a vehicle?\n\nYou know its a bad thing to do, and he is trying to take advantage of FaAaAaMiLy.\n\nIf he has already blocked you on social media, that is another red flag that says this is not something that you want to do.  How can you trust him when he has blocked you?", "NTA. Perfectly reasonable to not lend a car to someone who's shows no responsibility towards them, and it's important for the stepson to learn that actions have consequences", "NTA", "Nta hopefully he'll come around one day, send him cards and whatever for holidays so he knows he's welcome home as long as he foots his own bill", " NTA. You are right that he was financially irresponsible", "NTA - he thinks he\u2019s entitled to use of your stuff?  Why didn\u2019t he just rent a car? You don\u2019t even need a reason to say no.  You don\u2019t even owe him an explanation.  His blocking you etc is just more immature behavior.  It\u2019s emotional blackmail and I would go NC and tell him to F off since he is being so disrespectful and downright mean to his mom for no reason other than his own entitlement and selfishness", "NTA.\n\nThe vehicle owner is responsible for any parking fines or property damage related to your vehicle. Since your stepson already demonstrated that he's completely irresponsible with his own vehicles, there is no way he can be trusted to be responsible with someone else's vehicle. \n\nHe learned a hard lesson, but a valuable one.", "NTA.  At 25 he\u2019s old enough to learn hard lessons and this was one.  As far as getting him to contact you again, that\u2019ll be hard if his father is enabling his irresponsible behavior.  He\u2019s going to gravitate towards his dad and think you are the asshole until that stops.", "YTA. Sorry but your step seems to have been trying to do the right thing. It sounds like he made a mistake and now you're holding it over his head. \n\nHe lost his job and his scooter was stolen and then he found it his step dad and his mom weren't willing to temporarily lend him one of three cars they have (in their one income house? Why do you need three cars?). What a shitty time to be your step son. At least his real dad stepped up. \n\nIt is your car, do with it what you will.

He has demonstrated his  irresponsibility when it comes to cars allowing tickets to build up and not paying for them. You couldn't trust that he wouldn't do that to you.", "NTA. I think you made a very wise choice and should not feel guilty. Even if you where rich you would not be the asshole here. You are not responsible for his poor choices", "Agreed. NTA", "My wife and I have two kids together (10 and 8). I'm their sole source of support financially speaking. Meanwhile, my stepson has a father. It seems more appropriate for him to take the risk.", "He lost use of his own vehicle for not paying tickets when he still had a job, why would they lend him a car?", "You forgot that the stepson also had multiple accidents and loads of parking fines. It's not like he is this responsible guy that you would happily lend a car to.", "Risk honestly seems minimal. Unless he has a history of getting his car taken off the road, paying it off, and then getting it taken off the road again? \n\nIf not then you're just an asshole who I suspect was looking for a way to kick your step son while he was down. If he does then I will happily change my vote and admit I was wrong though.", "He fucked up. If it was a one time thing you can help him out. Or you cannot help out your kid when he's in a bind. The kind of person who doesn't help out their kid due to what seems like a one time fuck up is an asshole in my book.", "OP has multiple extra cars. In the unlikely event the step son did get into an accident A) insurance would cover it and B) OP would have 2 other cars to fall back on. Hell if they're in the U.S the step son's insurance would cover it so there wouldn't be financial burden on OP.\n\nThe kid had accidents in the past, OP didn't say who was at fault or the circumstances around it. When I was 21 I wrecked a car. Haven't had a real accident since then. Should that accident follow me for the rest of my life and be used to kick me while I'm down?", "In fairness he's never had his car taken off the road he chose to take it off the road but my \"history\" is the parking tickets themselves.", "How long do you think it takes to rack up enough tickets that you're concerned about your car being repossessed? I would maybe help my child pay down the tickets so they could use their own car, but lending them my car would not be an option.", "So either Stepson is the most unlucky dude in the world or stepson is irresponsible. Based on what OP wrote, I think it's the latter", "He got in a car accident when he was 18. The parking tickets are more recent.", "Cool, so you kid fucked up once and you left him in the lurch. No apology needed from me which is nice. I hope you're happy throwing at least a 15 year relationship with your step son down the drain over what could have been a simple favor from you. \n\nSound step son seems a lot like my mom. For what ever reason she can't park legally to save her life. But I would lend her my car if she needed it because I love her, respect her, and know she wouldn't purposely screw me over. But again you decided to not help out YOUR kid. And now he knows to never count on you. Once again, and you even said this yourself, good thing his real dad is around for him.", "So? He clearly was going to pay them, it isn't like he was driving around illegally. He responsibly got himself a scooter and was going to work. He got hit by some bad luck and the people he clearly thought were there to support him told him to kick rocks. \n\nThe kid fucked up, but acting like this was going to ruin OPs life is insane. Again where I am a good parent helps their kid out when they're able to. I feel sorry for you if that isn't the case where ever you're from.", "Sounds like unlucky. The accident was seven years ago per op. The parking tickets are a recent thing. The lay off and the stolen scooter are also recent.", "So seven years ago he got into an accident and you're holding it against him? Insurance companies aren't even that judgey.", "Why on earth are you guilt trapping OP? 99% of the people here think OP is clearly not the asshole. You can disagree with that, but why on earth are you being so manipulative towards OP?", "Multiple tickets = multiple fuck ups. Multiple unpaid tickets =/= one mistake.\n\nIt's a pattern that OP should not have to pay for.", "Was he? He got a scooter instead of paying his tickets. Bio dad didn't lend his car either, he just helped pay off the tickets.", "99% of the people here are clapping OP on the back for teaching the step son a lesson. \n\nCurrent #1 top rated comment: \"NTA You aren't responsible for bailing someone out of their poor life choices.\" \n\n\\#3 \"Don\u2019t worry. He will get back in touch with you when he wants something else and his other enablers have gotten tired of him. NTA\"\n\nWhen I read this story I saw a young adult asking his family for help after he lost his job and had his only means of travel stolen. You ask why am I guilt tripping op? Because I think he is guilty of being an asshole and I think the 99% of people saying he isn't don't live in the real world. They see OP as righteously teaching this kid a lesson. \n\nIf a lesson has ben taught it isn't the one they're hoping for.", "It is getting the car impounded that was the fuck up. Obviously the son shouldn't keep getting tickets. He fucked up and was owning it. He didn't expect to have his scooter stolen and to get laid off. Nothing in OPs story shows this poor dude to be a villain. Just someone who fucked up and needed help from family. Help he didn't get from dear old Step Dad.", "Dude a cheap e scooter is like $100-$200 and he needed to get to work. It isn't like he bought himself a playstation. He got himself a cheap way to commute while he car was in the storage area.", "You can also be reflective. In this case, it's pretty clear to most readers that the stepson isn't unlucky, but irresponsible. Maybe you have a personal reason to feel OP is an asshole and that is okay. But guilt trapping someone who pretty much everyone feels is doing the right thing, is a bit unfair.", "1) The car was not impounded. The car was put in storage by OP's stepson. \n\n2) It was multiple unpaid tickets that caused this action. Mul-ti-ple. Many. More than one. (This is pre-K math, here.) It is an established pattern of many instances of identical behavior that caused the problem.\n\n3) Given the multiple posts (many, many posts) defending the poor adulting of the stepson, I'm going to guess that you're either the stepson, or you are trying to absolve some massively entitled behavior of your own.\n\n4) If you are the stepson or stepson behavior adjacent, maybe notice that the NTA's are at over 99%. This would make the stepson the AH.", "Which is why helping him pay off the original tickets is the smarter move than lending another vehicle to run up tickets on, or crash.", "Honestly, I don't go by what most reddit users think. One of the reasons I have never posted my own AITA. I think people here often have a too black and white reasoning and ignore real world implications of any given OP's actions. \n\nOP is allowed to do whatever he hell he wants with his own car. I don't agree with it. Obviously his step son doesn't either. I certainly don't think the step on is the asshole for asking to use an extra car do you?\n\nDo you think the step son is an asshole for being upset at his step dad for not helping him out? I don't.\n\nI think people are hung up on OP's justification which I think is bullshit. If the stepson got a ticket there is every indication the stepson would strive to pay it off. \n\nSo for me it comes down to 'OP could help out his step son. He didn't. His reasoning not to help seems flimsy and paper thin to me\". That is what makes him an asshole.\n\nI also think it is telling (in a positive way) that OP is only responding to me and my posts rather than the 99% of people who are glad that the stepson is being taught this valuable and likely painful lesson.", "1. Sorry I didn't use precise enough language for you. I get how that was confusing for you and will try and do better.\n2. Yes, he fucked up. But the major fuck up was it getting taken off the road. I'm not saying the guy should keep getting tickets. I suspect he learned this lesson and is trying to do better. Or not time will tell.\n3. Yes clearly I am the step son. And given your multiple posts (multiple meaning more than one) defending OP I must now conclude you are him.  \n4. My car has never been taken off the road and other than street sweeping days when I was sick from work I can't remember the last time I got a parking ticket. I did get into a bad accident in my early 20's that totaled my car. Lucky for me my parents weren't assholes and helped me get back on my feet. I learned my lesson and it never happened again AND I was able to commute to and from work (or job interviews in the step sons case since he was just laid off).", "Ok but OP didn't do that either. He told OP to kick rocks. Also OP has three different vehicles. It doesn't seem like it would be a burden to OP to let his step kid use one. \n\nWe don't know the deal with the bio dad, it could have been easy for the step son to get the money from him or it could have been a huge burden on the dad or the son. What I do know is OP had three cars. There are two people of driving age in his household. For a limited amount of time he could have helped out his step kid and chose not to. In my book if a parent can help out a kid and doesn't, they're a dick. \n\nAgain the kid fucked up, but he's also had the time from hell. A little love coming from his step dad likely would have been really helpful."]}
