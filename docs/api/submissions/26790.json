I am home if I am not at work. Long story short, I couldn\u2019t handle having this girl around.

It\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t have a home, she just likes our home cuz it\u2019s convenient to party and bring guys over (we are all in our 30s).

You didn't insist that the person doesn't come to the apartment -at all-, this is their (your flatmate and Guest) interpretation, so if they are frustrated or angry about it, that's actually not on you.", "NTA - She was a guest, living in your house rent free, you kicked her out which you had every right to do because she was treating your home that she was part time living in for free like she owned it. Honestly the moment she started bringing random guys round to the house... I would have kicked her out for that, who does that as a quest in someone's home?", "Where was she sleeping? or was she \"only\" hanging out at your place?  If hanging out, it sounds like Guest was there almost every day.  No, she doesn't need to be there all the time, you should be able to enjoy your home with your two roommates and some occasional guests but not having another person there all the time.

Not an hourly hotel or a free shelter.  Id be like \u201cgo home lady and act like an adult with self respect.\u201d\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t even be put in that position in the first place so the one who is mad at you should really just get over herself or himself.  That  arrangement was weird to begin with.", "NTA, this is your home, the one place you should feel safe and comfortable.
