She asked me to get my daughter (13F) to go outside and help her. My daughter was still asleep, so I gently knocked on her door and asked her to help my wife plant the daffodils. She complained and said she was too tired to get up. \n\nMy daughter loves acai bowls so I offered to order one for her if she helped her mom in the garden. She immediately agreed and was very happy. I called my wife and asked if she wanted one too, and she started yelling, explaining how upset she was that I was going to order acai bowls, saying how tired she was and she needed food of sustenance. I offered to order something else for her, anything she wanted. She yelled that I need to stop ordering (the last time I ordered food was about a week ago) and saying I'm too ungrateful for her cooking. I apologized and she called me a shitty husband for ordering acai bowls. I don't understand what she has against the stuff! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI apologized yet again and told her I just wouldn't order it after all. My daughter was upset, but she understood, as my wife often gets angry over little things. So my daughter went outside to help plant the bulbs anyway. Roughly 45 minutes later she came back inside, fighting tears. I asked what was wrong and she explained that the whole time she was out there her mom had been yelling at her for asking for acai bowls and ranting about how upset she is at me. While my daughter continues to explain the hurtful things my wife said, I get a call from her. She's upset that I didn't order lunch. Wtf?  \n\nI apologize and ask her what she wants. She starts crying and rants for 10 minutes about how nobody cares for her and nobody helps her. My daughter and I exchange a look, we both know that's not true.

I think you did a nice thing by offering her an acai bowl. \n\nThe fact that your wife yelled at you, told you she needed more substantial food, and called you a shitty husband for planning to order food is way over the line. \n\nYou also said your wife often gets angry over little things \u2014 and went on to spend the gardening task complaining to your young teenage daughter to the point where she was nearly crying. That is totally unacceptable. I had this experience growing up and it created a strained relationship between me and my parent, and one where I didn't want to ever come to them because they would flip out or start getting angry. Plus they were always talking poorly about my other parent and it made me feel awful.  \n\nYou cannot let your wife do this. Not only to your daughter,  but to you. She's undermining you and your decisions as a parent. AND, she's making herself seem unstable and not approachable for your daughter if she were in crisis and needing help ( likely she would turn to you instead). \n\nYour wife then goes on to cry and complain some more about how nobody loves/cares for her. She sounds like she is very overwhelmed and tired and needs some sleep. Maybe she thinks she isn't getting the help she needs? (But, your wife is an adult with a child \u2014 she needs to properly communicate with you and your daughter what help she needs, and what her expectations are.) She can't behave like this, and set such a poor example for your daughter.  This is NOT how to treat your family and your partner. \n\nYou and your kid shouldn't have to be exchanging looks like it's an episode of The Office \u2014 your wife needs to sort her stuff out and correct herself. \n\nTo top it off, you do exactly what she asks and order Chipotle , then she's calling you an AH for listening to her? \n\nYup. Your wife needs to get some professional help, or start taking an honest look at her behavior.  Your 13 year old sounds more mature from the details of this post. Not great.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to get your daughter into therapy right now and have a talk with your wife about appropriate ways to talk to your daughter.\n\nComplaining to her kid about her husband is a form of emotional incest, treating that child as an equal adult and expecting her to do emotional labor for her own mother is abusive.\n\nBoth my parents did this to me and it can do a ton of damage.\n\nPlease protect your daughter.", "What I saw from your comments to your wife is you are a huge enabler. Stop saying sorry all the time for her misbehavior and treatment to you and your daughter. Your wife got the help yet she complained about the help and then proceeded to bash you for getting help. Your daughter will suffer mentally from her mothers treatment. Basically your allowing your daughter and you to be emotionally and mentally abused and not even realizing the damage that\u2019s happening.", "NTA. Your wife seems\u2026 abusive tbh. If this is the whole story of course. \n\nI get chores that contribute to the household. But why does your daughter need to help in a garden? Doesn\u2019t she want the garden or does your wife? It just seems weird to wake a kid up and demand they help with something so trivial that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with contributing to everyone/the household. Gardening is a hobby. \n\nAlso a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls are actually super nutritious  and filling lol\u2026.maybe if she actually tried one instead of being bitter and mean\u2026. She\u2019d like it.", "NTA. Your wife sends very mixed signals. \n\nGardening isn\u2019t necessarily a common house chore so it\u2019s reasonable to offer up an incentive to do it, and it\u2019s thoughtful of you to also ask your wife. She could have just said \u201cno thank you\u201d or asked if you could order/make something different for her. Instead she\u2019s acting like you\u2019re horrible and then making your daughter feel like she is at fault. So much drama over some a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls. (I\u2019ve never had one but I don\u2019t imagine they\u2019re so expensive that it would be this terrible thing to have every once in a while)\n\nI don\u2019t know what your finances are like, but I believe some Family Therapy could be helpful.", "NTA.

Honest advice? Stop being gentle and be blunt with your wife. Tell her that taking her anger out on your daughter only does more damage. Don\u2019t apologize if she gets angry, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If it continues to escalate like this, you need to remove yourself and your daughter from the situation. Think you can do that?", "https://youtu.be/ZQ49UoiLe5A i think youll find this video the only proper response\n\nNTA wow your wife is awful", "NTA. I\u2019m gonna tell you right now, stop apologizing and start standing up for yourself. Your wife gets so upset at the smallest things? She complains of not getting help or care when you and your daughter both know that\u2019s not true? She sounds either manipulative and abusive, or mentally ill. Seek help, if not for anything but your daughter\u2019s sake.", "NTA. Your wife needs to recognize when she\u2019s hangry. That\u2019s not something you can discuss in the moment but maybe after.  She needed to have snickers and relax (unless medically inadvisable).", "Your wife needs at least one of the following: 1) therapy\n2) a support system to vent to that isn't her child\n3) an attitude check (SHE CALLED YOU AN ASSHOLE LIKE 3 TIMES AND YOU APOLOGIZED 4) to be served divorce papers.\n\nNTA buddy", "NTA, is this behavior normal for her? If not, she should consider getting her hormones checked. Sounds like signs of early menopause.
