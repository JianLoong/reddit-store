I think you did a nice thing by offering her an acai bowl. \n\nThe fact that your wife yelled at you, told you she needed more substantial food, and called you a shitty husband for planning to order food is way over the line. \n\nYou also said your wife often gets angry over little things \u2014 and went on to spend the gardening task complaining to your young teenage daughter to the point where she was nearly crying. That is totally unacceptable. I had this experience growing up and it created a strained relationship between me and my parent, and one where I didn't want to ever come to them because they would flip out or start getting angry. Plus they were always talking poorly about my other parent and it made me feel awful.  \n\nYou cannot let your wife do this. Not only to your daughter,  but to you. She's undermining you and your decisions as a parent. AND, she's making herself seem unstable and not approachable for your daughter if she were in crisis and needing help ( likely she would turn to you instead). \n\nYour wife then goes on to cry and complain some more about how nobody loves/cares for her. She sounds like she is very overwhelmed and tired and needs some sleep. Maybe she thinks she isn't getting the help she needs? (But, your wife is an adult with a child \u2014 she needs to properly communicate with you and your daughter what help she needs, and what her expectations are.) She can't behave like this, and set such a poor example for your daughter.  This is NOT how to treat your family and your partner. \n\nYou and your kid shouldn't have to be exchanging looks like it's an episode of The Office \u2014 your wife needs to sort her stuff out and correct herself. \n\nTo top it off, you do exactly what she asks and order Chipotle , then she's calling you an AH for listening to her? \n\nYup. Your wife needs to get some professional help, or start taking an honest look at her behavior.  Your 13 year old sounds more mature from the details of this post.

Stop saying sorry all the time for her misbehavior and treatment to you and your daughter. Your wife got the help yet she complained about the help and then proceeded to bash you for getting help.

If this is the whole story of course. \n\nI get chores that contribute to the household. But why does your daughter need to help in a garden? Doesn\u2019t she want the garden or does your wife? It just seems weird to wake a kid up and demand they help with something so trivial that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with contributing to everyone/the household.
