Who do you think you are?? /s", "NTA. Those dogs and their reactions are not your responsibility, it\u2019s their owners.

Don't let them walk over you. Call their bluff and let them call the police. Bet they'd be the ones reprimanded for wasting police time.

There is nothing stopping them from walking their dogs elsewhere", "NTA they should sit somewhere else.

I\u2019ve owned dogs for the past 18 years (beagles, at that, and they can have loud bays!), and the only thing I could ever imagine getting upset with someone about at a park is if there dog was off lead if they weren\u2019t supposed to be or if someone approached my dog with their dog or child without checking first since you never know how friendly someone\u2019s dog is.\n\nOP, you were using the park as intended, and it isn\u2019t your responsibility to change your actions to make space for someone else.

You are using a public facility in an appropriate manner and this group are trying to run you off. I'd report to park management as harassment - don't need to phrase as that.
