You were more accommodating than I would have been.  I would definitely go make a report about it just to have it down though.  It sounds like they are going to give you shit.", "NTA wtf. Reading that made me so mad i flashed back to being sixteen and i actually said \u201cfuck you old man\u201d to my phone. Although if it makes you feel better if the cops did show up, you could just tell them this guy touched you and yelled at you and that shit\u2019ll flip on him real quick", "Dog owner here, with a reactive dog.\n\nAbsolutely 100% NTA.\nYou were in a public space.\nDog owners do not get to force you out of a public space because you were exciting the dogs. It\u2019s their responsibility to either ensure their dogs can handle being outside and being near people.\n\nIf you were actively teasing or interacting with the dogs then yeah you\u2019d be TA. \nThe guy saying he\u2019d call the cops? He\u2019s TA.", "LOL\n\nLet him call the cops, hell, encourage it.

It is up to people to train their dogs while in public. Or they should sit elsewhere where people going around their reasonable business aren't harassed. NTA.", "NTA. You are using the facilities for their intended use. \n\nIf that upsets him and his animals, then he needs to train his animals better or to toddle of to somewhere else to drink his coffee. There are benches and cafes all over the city, there are very few good free exercise options that aren\u2019t just running or walking up and down stairs.", "NTA, it\u2019s a public park and you have every right to use the equipment as it\u2019s intended.\n\nIt sounds like you tried to compromise with the dog owner, which they were completely unwilling to do. Any further interaction on their part may constitute harassment, depending on where you live. As others have suggested, you may want to film any further interactions since some people will lie to the cops to get their way.", "NTA. If I were you I\u2019d use the park even harder lol. Screw them.", "NTA. these dog walkers don\u2019t own the park and their threat to call the cops on you is hilarious. \n\nthey need to train their damn dogs.", "NTA. I\u2019d love to see what the police will say. \n\nAlso\u2026\u201dour park\u201d?", "NTA", "Just tell them I don't want you in my park either and I'll call the police on you for harassing me. Jesus some people think they own the world.", "NTA. It\u2019s a public park and they\u2019re the assholes for trying to assert some kind of private ownership by telling you not to use the *public* exercise equipment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s there for: for members of the public to use. \n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s *their* job as dog walkers to keep the dogs in their care under control. What are they going to do when a squirrel runs by and inevitably excites the dogs? Demand that the trees be chopped down?\n\nMassive entitlement issues by these people. You are not even close to the asshole here.", "The dog owners (and I say this as a dog owner) are 100% wrong.  NTA, and your should contact the police yourself(to protect against false accusations and to report the harassment)", "NTA. Sounds like they need to train their dogs, honestly.", "NTA. The park is free for everyone to use. If they have an issue, they should try actually training their dogs.", "NTA let them call whoever they want, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong", " \n\nThey should probably be located somewhere away from the exercise area.", "I think OP should pre-emptively make a report at the local police station over harassment. Getting this on the record might make a difference when this guy calls the cops on OP for existing in the same space.", "Also the dog walkers sound super entitled by saying \u201cour park\u201d. First of all it\u2019s a public park so they don\u2019t have a day who uses it, they can call the police all they want but that don\u2019t change the fact that the park is not their personal property and open to everyone. OP is NTA but the dog walkers are", "I\u2019m going to guess OP is a person of color\u2026", "Also, maaaaybe the dog owners should train their damn dogs?\n\nMost well trained dogs won\u2019t give a shit about someone exercising / moving fast", "[removed]", "The threat to call the police made me wonder if part if this is race motivated? It seems weird to me that they think that they have any reasonable reason to call the police, but it's a genuine threat when made against a POC, so I'm wondering if OP is a POC?", "Honestly, OP should be the one to call the police. He's doing absolutely nothing wrong, and this man is harassing him in a public space.\n\nIf I were him, I would call the cops right in front of the geezer to report it. \n\n\"We'll call the police!\" \n\n\"I'll save you the trouble!\"", "This is a great idea. Post to Craig\u2019s list or FB, mentioning you\u2019re looking to start a local exercise group that\u2019s free to join, and that beginners/all levels are welcome to join. Mention the time and location, and I bet you\u2019ll have a small group that might blossom to a larger one!", "This kinda explains things. \nThe equipment in the kouens are not for any vigorous exercise, I was once told, but more for casual activity and tends to be used by the older generation or kids. \nI was once told off harshly by an older man when I had my earphones in as well, because apparently everyone could hear my music and therefore was committing a grave disturbance. It was humliating. \nAll this happened in a Tokyo suburb.\n\nOf course you're NTA. But when you're a POC in Japan, speaking out for your rights is not going to amount to anything, realistically speaking. If I were you I'd probably just steer clear of this group and try to find a different time to visit the park.", "Ah. This is likely racism at play, then. \n\nThey are objectively in the wrong, if it is a public park. But there may be a culturally appropriate way to deal with it I am unaware of. Check with your Japanese friends. Offer dog treats and unearned honorifics?\n\nThe thing that bothers me the most of all the rudeness is him touching you without permission.", "As you are not brown, if this were America I'd say to just let them call the police so they can get chewed out for misuse of public resources. But I have no idea how the police would work in Japan and they might get on your case for \"being a nuisance to public tranquility\" or some shit. Though I guarantee what they're actually angry about is some foreigner hating baka gaijin crap.", "I had the same thought process", "The dogs also may just be getting excited and wanting their owners to walk them or play with them instead of making them sit around leashed while they have social hour. They see this person moving/playing and want to have some fun, too", "And maybe the dogs are getting worked up because they haven\u2019t been exercised properly, because the dog owners are sitting around talking and not *walking*. The dogs probably see OP working out and think \u201cI want to play too!\u201d\nDog owners need to train/look after their animals.\nVery much NTA.", "[removed]", "Seems pointlessly mean to the dogs but I doubt that was your first thought.\n\nEdit to add: NTA.", "Honestly I had the exact same thought esp when offered a great compromise the reply was:\n\n> \"We don't want you in our park\"\n\nYeesh...", "[removed]", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Acrobgd) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u91vb/aita_for_inadvertently_winding_peoples_dogs_up/j7ap35c/)", "[removed]", "That and the \u201cwe don\u2019t want you in our park\u201d line.
