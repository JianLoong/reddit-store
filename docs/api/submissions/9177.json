I\u2019m listening to music also. \n\nSometimes this dog walker group come to the park and they sit and drink coffee and chat on some benches near the exercise area (roughly 20m away.) \n\nToday as I was exercising I felt someone tap/hit my arm and noticed that an older gentleman was trying to get my attention. I pulled out my headphones immediately and asked what was wrong and he started shouting at me for ignoring him. I apologized and said I couldn\u2019t hear him due to the music. \n\nI noticed that 4 of the 6 dogs in this group were going a bit bonkers, barking and trying to pull away from their owners, and the older gentleman started telling me how it was my fault and I was winding the dogs up and the same thing had happened last week. \n\nI said that it wasn\u2019t my intention and that I was just trying to exercise. He told me to exercise elsewhere. I said that this was the closest place to do it to my home and I\u2019m free to exercise when I want. \n\nI then asked what time and day the walkers come and I can try and get to the park before they come, but the older fella said \u201cno, we don\u2019t need to tell you that. We don\u2019t want you in our park and if you keep causing trouble the police will be called.\u201d \n\nI feel bad for causing the group hassle, but at the same time, there are other benches in the park where they can sit also.\n\n*EDIT 1*\n\nTo give some more context.
