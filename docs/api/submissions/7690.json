{"id": 7690, "submission_id": "10fkh8p", "title": "AITA for contacting my daughter's therapist?", "selftext": "My (57F) daughter (24F) has always been a difficult child. I did have high expectations for her growing up and I may have been a little harsher than most parents but it was always with her best interests in mind. \n\nAs a child she started lying to me about things like homework and her grades to avoid punishment. I told her lying would never be tolerated and made myself clear, but she could not stop. I sent her to therapy for her lying problem and came with her to sessions. After a few sessions, things were not improving so we stopped. \n\nAs a teenager, she developed an eating disorder and lied to cover it up, but obviously I found out because she was losing weight rapidly and sent her to therapy once again. I sat in the first session to make sure she was honest with the therapist. She seemed to improve a bit and gain some weight back. \n\nIn college she moved far away from me and began drinking and partying and the eating disorder came back. Because of this, I stopped paying her tuition and made my reasons clear. She was very upset because she was still getting straight A's, but I did not relent on my decision. Drinking under 21 is illegal and I would not be paying for her to have an inappropriate college experience. She studied extra hard to graduate early, which is impressive but I did not approve of because I knew she was not mature enough to enter the working world at 22. \n\nSure enough she started a job right after college and when COVID hit she developed a marijuana problem. Eventually the company she worked for had mass layoffs and she was one of those let go. (I maintain that if she worked harder and stopped using drugs she might still have that job.) \n\nShe moved closer to home and was able to find a new job and start therapy again for her many issues. However, in the six months that she has been in therapy I have seen no emotional progress. She is still bitter and miserable towards me and has lost some weight again. Based on what she has told me, I was able to find her therapist online and sent her an email about my daughter's problems just in case my daughter had not been completely honest. I just wanted to make sure everything was being properly addressed. My daughter found out and was furious, called me terrible and is refusing to speak to me. She does not understand that I was acting because of her history of dishonesty, and I want her to recover fully but she can't do that if she lies or omits things, and from her reaction I assumed she was. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Many of you have suggested going to therapy myself. I did see a therapist a few years ago and discussed my daughter's acting out. I was told nothing of my \"being a narcissist\" or \"abusive\" as many have claimed, and I am inclined to trust professional judgment. I stopped attending sessions because I did not find them particularly helpful. \n\nSeveral people also had questions about the validity of my daughter's marijuana problem. She attended college and started working in an extremely liberal city with a culture of using marijuana. She admitted in her own words that working from home was taking a toll on her, and she worried she was self medicating too much. I have always made my disgusting clear when it comes to smoking and this was no exception. So yes, it was a real problem but it is also true that I also do not approve of any drug use. \n\nThe final thing people have brought up is that I \"punished her for having an eating disorder.\" This is not true, I cut off her tuition mainly due to the drinking and partying. I also knew that she was perfectly capable of paying for the rest of her schooling because she had generous scholarships and she could increase her work/study hours. Additionally, she had enough money saved from her jobs in high school to cover the remaining semesters.", "created_utc": 1674081090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fkh8p/aita_for_contacting_my_daughters_therapist/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re responsible for the problems she developed as a child. They\u2019re directly caused by your actions.\n\nThe lying? She did it to avoid your punishments for low grades. Why would you punish a kid when their worst crime is *needing extra help and support*? You made yourself into an unsafe and volatile person. She lied in an attempt to *protect* herself from you.\n\nAll of this stress and constant punishment and high expectations contributed to her developing an eating disorder. And *you prevented her from getting the help she needed by sitting in on her therapy sessions.* Newsflash, it didn\u2019t work because she couldn\u2019t be honest with YOU present. She would\u2019ve been better off just talking to the therapist, because the therapist actually has her best interest in mind.\n\nShe moved away to get away from you, I can\u2019t blame her for that. And most college students who were kept on tight leashes by parents like you go wild in college because they\u2019re finally tasting freedom and discovering who they are. If you gave her a fairer and more balanced upbringing, she would\u2019ve been better prepared to handle those things in college.\n\nPulling her tuition is also just\u2026did she even have a problem with drinking and partying, or was she doing a normal amount and it was too much *for you*? Were you concerned with her or just punishing her for becoming more independent?\n\nDo you think every other person in the lay-off had drug problems? Sometimes you can be the hardest worker and still get laid off, times are tough. Are you really going to hold something out of her control over her head?\n\nAnd finally, contacting your *adult* daughter\u2019s therapist was highly inappropriate and invasive. You also didn\u2019t spell out her real problems because they ALL COME BACK TO YOU. You need to realize that.

The idea that you're worried she's not being honest to her therapy is astounding. What you're actually worried about is that she's not relating what \\_you\\_ to believe is true. In fact, she's probably telling her therapist the absolute truth -- you punished her so harshly she was scared of you, you sent her to therapy to \"fix\" her and insisted on being present for therapy to ensure it went the way \\*you\\* felt it should (ie address what you considered to be the problem and nothing else), you punished her again because even though she was getting straight A's, she wasn't spending every moment of every day behaving the way you thought she should, you blame her for getting laid off when tons of people were getting laid off and she was a relatively new employee (there's literally zero reason to think behaving differently would have saved her job), and now that she's in therapy again you contact her therapist so you can continue to micro-manage her.

The way you talk about her mental health problems is judgmental and full of distaste, and I suspect that's why she's been dishonest with you about them (especially given you *punished* her partly for *having an eating disorder* by *withdrawing her educational funding.*) Also, a good therapist is not going to listen to anything you say in this way, but you have informed her that your daughter has an overbearing parent that can't respect her boundaries.

(That's part of their training and experience)\n\nYTA - in addition to the long litany of your not letting your daughter be herself, contacting her therapist is crossing a significant line.

I entered the working world at 15 FFS.  \n\nShe is an adult. You have zero responsibility or right to talk to her therapist. You have no say over anything she discusses with anyone or where she works. She has a history of being dishonest **with you** for good reason.

She may find she needs to find a different therapist, now, one who is not influenced by you. \n\nAnd if she's felt the need to lie to you, in the past, it was because she couldn't trust you with the truth.

I did have high expectations for her growing up and I may have been a little harsher than most parents but it was always with her best interests in mind. \n\nAs a child she started lying to me about things like homework and her grades to avoid punishment. I told her lying would never be tolerated and made myself clear, but she could not stop. I sent her to therapy for her lying problem and came with her to sessions. After a few sessions, things were not improving so we stopped. \n\nAs a teenager, she developed an eating disorder and lied to cover it up, but obviously I found out because she was losing weight rapidly and sent her to therapy once again. I sat in the first session to make sure she was honest with the therapist. She seemed to improve a bit and gain some weight back. \n\nIn college she moved far away from me and began drinking and partying and the eating disorder came back. Because of this, I stopped paying her tuition and made my reasons clear. She was very upset because she was still getting straight A's, but I did not relent on my decision. Drinking under 21 is illegal and I would not be paying for her to have an inappropriate college experience. She studied extra hard to graduate early, which is impressive but I did not approve of because I knew she was not mature enough to enter the working world at 22. \n\nSure enough she started a job right after college and when COVID hit she developed a marijuana problem. Eventually the company she worked for had mass layoffs and she was one of those let go. (I maintain that if she worked harder and stopped using drugs she might still have that job.) \n\nShe moved closer to home and was able to find a new job and start therapy again for her many issues. However, in the six months that she has been in therapy I have seen no emotional progress. She is still bitter and miserable towards me and has lost some weight again. Based on what she has told me, I was able to find her therapist online and sent her an email about my daughter's problems just in case my daughter had not been completely honest. I just wanted to make sure everything was being properly addressed. My daughter found out and was furious, called me terrible and is refusing to speak to me. She does not understand that I was acting because of her history of dishonesty, and I want her to recover fully but she can't do that if she lies or omits things, and from her reaction I assumed she was.

The reason I didn't develop one is because I needed the fuel to evade the stereos (and other things) that she would launch at me with an evil smirk on her face whenever my dad wasn't home.\n\nI sincerely hope and pray to any and all deities that have ever been worshipped, past, present, future, fiction and reality, that you never threw anything at your daughter and that you never, EVER put your hands on her", "This has got to be made up, right? \n\nNo one could possibly write a post stating so many blatant examples of how EXTREMELY controlling they are and still question AITA\u2026. Right?\n\nYES! YTA.", "In the very very tiny silver lining, the therapist now has a different source to analyse the abuse and invasiveness the daughter has experienced. I bet that email shone a light on a lot of things the daughter has expressed and hopefully the therapist can use that (not the content, the act) to assist the daughter gaining more confidence to go NC with OP.", "Truly one of the worst AITAs I\u2019ve seen here. \n\nThis poor girl hasn\u2019t been able to win in her mother\u2019s eyes in her entire life. Of course she\u2019s developed unhealthy coping mechanisms! My heart breaks for her. \n\nThe fact that her mother comes here with her sanctimonious tone and litany of judgments wondering if she\u2019s an asshole\u2026 \n\nShe\u2019s obviously driven enough to maintain straight A\u2019s and graduate early even while gasp! having a normal college experience and all OP can do is criticize and blame.", "Emailing the therapist might have actually been a good thing....now the therapist will know the direct cause of many of her issues...the overbearing mom", "THIS. I hope she feels every word of this.", "As someone who constantly lied to my mom for the same reason and developed an eating disorder, I agree with you, except for this point:\n\n> And you prevented her from getting the help she needed by sitting in on her therapy sessions. Newsflash, it didn\u2019t work because she couldn\u2019t be honest with YOU present. She would\u2019ve been better off just talking to the therapist, because the therapist actually has her best interest in mind.\n\nOP just sat in on _one_ session, which would be helpful because OP can raise issues that she thinks are pertinent, THE THERAPIST CAN DECIDE IF THOSE ARE RELEVANT, and would\u2019ve allowed the therapist to see what their relationship is like, which would definitely provide insight on this girls issues.", "I didn\u2019t know what to say. But what you said puts it best. She has royally screwed up her daughter.", "100% this. YTA OP.\n\nI am a parent to two kids and they are gonna fuck up and lie and experiment and have wild fun. I want to protect them from everything, but you can't. Tightening the reigns to the degree you have so often leads to bigger problems. Sometimes kids need an ally, not judge and jury.", "All I could think about by the time I nearly reached the end of that post was how the best thing that OP could ever do for her daughter's mental health is to completely remove herself from her life.\n\nIt's so clear that OP is an abusive, controlling, cruel, manipulative, impossible-to-please asshole. And *this* is her attempt to make us think she's *not* the asshole in this situation? Legitimately terrifying to think about how much worse the reality of the situation actually is.\n\nYTA, obviously. ...But asshole doesn't even *begin* to cover it.", ">I may have been a little harsher than most parents but it was always with her best interests in mind.\n\nWhen ever someone says \"their best interests in mind.\" i know what the really mean is \"My best interests in mind.\"", "Absolutely 100% this.\n\nJesusTapDancingChristOnACracker\n\nYTA.", "this exactly. the fact that you thought talking to the therapist was okay and expecting it to help shows just how little you yourself know about life.", "Good lord yes. This mom is just wow.", "I want to find the daughter and hug her, OP sounds like a nightmare.", "I hope the daughter goes no contact and what ever she does in life she can find joy, and peace.", "I am truly disturbed by the level of contempt this woman seems to have for her daughter over very very very normal life things.", "Have you ever had a parent reach out to you like this? What would you do in that scenario?", "My mom is just like OP. It was such a mind fuck having a mom like that, being a kid and not understanding why I cant do anything right. It took so much therapy to truly believe I wasn't the problem.", "Well, it works as direct evidence for her therapist to say, \"Yeah, you're right - your mom is overbearing, controlling, demanding, and demeaning towards you.\"", "Oh I bet 99% of those sessions are about the awful, controlling mother who constantly criticised her. \n\nOP YTA- I feel sorry for your daughter reading your own account of events. You are worried about her having an \"inappropriate college experience\", you blame her for losing her job during layoffs because she could have kept her job if she worked harder, you complain she isn't making enough progress  in therapy  for her \"many issues\". The poor girl can do nothing right can she?", "I accept that I was over critical at times, but in my opinion using her therapy to examine every tiny mistake I might have made to try and find someone to blame is not helpful. Her problems now are exactly that: HER problems. She refuses to take the responsibility she should, and it has caused difficulty in our relationship. Again, I was only thinking of her best interests and she cannot solve her issues if she is not honest.", "I couldn't agree more.  I hope the daughter sees this and sees all of the support she's getting.  My heart goes out to her.", "This deserves an award - also, OP, YTA", "Same! Signed, another \"difficult child\"", "> \u201cshe can't do that [recover] if she lies or omits things\". Yes she can. Therapists know when their clients are avoiding or fabricating. And they still succeed. (That's part of their training and experience)\n\nAt the first session? When they haven\u2019t even gotten to know you? I doubt that. They\u2019re not mind readers.", "I'm amazed the therapist allowed the mom to sit in on  the therapy when she was a child and first went to therapy. My mom is just like OP and tried to do that shit when she sent me to therapy. the therapist put a end to that right away. She said you can sit in for this meeting but never again unless I say it's OK and retroblazed420 says it's OK.", "How is contacting her therapist inappropriate if she\u2019s not asking information about her daughter, but rather sharing what she sees as pertinent?", "ALL of this. Particularly the stuff about lying about grades. Poor girl knew that underperformance wasn\u2019t tolerated and probably lied just to not be made to feel even more awful.", "my daughters gone no contact and won\u2019t invite me to the wedding. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong as a parent and I don\u2019t know why./s that\u2019ll be her next Reddit post", "It\u2019s actually good that she considers herself into the therapy, because now her therapist knows exactly what the daughters been dealing with", ">You didn't say anything positive about her in this post\n\nGod I didn't see it til you pointed it out, that's disgusting. She just rattles off a litany of complaints like she's a faulty appliance. Not even a shallow attempt at some perfunctory praise or compassion to soften the tone, literally just slagging her off for the whole post.", "When my mother did this my therapist *did* break HIPAA. I obviously reported him and got a new therapist, but man did the whole thing cement that NC with my mother was the right call. So manipulative.", "Right? I read this sub kind of a lot and this one is SHOCKING. That poor daughter. I hope she learns her worth and starts having some joy.", "You\u2019re also majorly overreacting to her marijuana use (which is probably about easing her anxiety that YOU caused), but that\u2019s a secondary issue.", "The only point is disagree with is \u201cnot everything is about you\u201d. Based on OPs admitted behaviour, I guarantee you those therapy sessions are largely about OP, most specifically helping her daughter cope with such an overbearing mother. OP should get used to her daughter not talking to her. If she hasn\u2019t already, she\u2019s working up to going NC.", "Her answer is just going to be any of the following:\n\nThe therapist is clearly flawed\nMy daughter is lying again\nThe therapist has brainwashed my daughter into hating me when I did what any good parent would do.  \n\nWith people like OP, it\u2019s never their fault, it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s.", "Exactly. And if that therapist is any good, they now know. So really, maybe the email helped the therapist understand a little more why her daughter has issues. I hope for the daughter\u2019s sake, she remains no contact.", "I have literally NO surprises that a child of this person developed an ED. I second that OP should seek out their own therapy. \n\nI can only hope their daughter finds the courage to go NC and find her way forward.", "\ud83c\udfc6", "The OP should not contact her daughter's therapist. She should contact  a DIFFERENT therapist.   The OP will attempt to worm her way into her daughter's therapy. Also, it would take away her daughter's safe place. Something her daughter's therapist will be aware of.\n\nOP can search, online, for her own damn therapist.", "Nope, no therapy with abusers. OP just needs to back off forever.", "Darn this is almost as long as your stinking garbage post. I'm impressed with myself.", "I did not graduate early. I went to college on a scholarship. I used to work in database management but I stopped working when my daughter was in middle school.", "I just hope the daughter can still trust the therapist. When it was done to me that trust was permanently broken.\n\nFrankly, I admire that the daughter here has been able to keep trying even after OP's meddling and making clear she sees therapists' duty as brainwashing their patients to meet parents' demands.", "And every good therapist would appreciate the context. Is the client understating or overstating the truth in their experience? I'm sure OP's daughter has talked at length about her mother. Now the therapist knows what's up. And thankfully, the therapist can't communicate with the mother because of HIPPA (at least in the US), so mommy dearest has no way to manipulate the therapist. \n\nOP, YTA. You seem to put a needless amount of pressure on your daughter but it never seems to be good enough. She did well in school but she lied to you. She probably did this out of self-preservation. She lied about her eating disorder because it was the only thing she felt she could control. Despite having an eating disorder, she still got enough scholarship money to not truly need your help (thank goodness). She had an active social life (which you seem to have a problem with) and may have partied a little too much. But with tight reins at home, a kid's gonna let loose a bit when they get away from that controlling influence. Despite partying and an eating disorder, she still graduated early, which is impressive because eating disorders make thinking very difficult. But she wasn't mature enough to enter the workforce according to you. She got laid off (along with hundreds of thousands of other people), and you blamed it on her not living her life in accordance with YOUR standards. And then you have the GALL to insert yourself into her therapeutic relationship (which she sought out herself this time). And you wonder why she sometimes engages in maladaptive coping strategies?! It's you. Butt out of her life and let her grow up in the way she needs to.", "Aside from EVERYTHING else, the fact that the daughter is getting straight A's while also having a normal college social life, and then being punished for it just blows my mind.", "I don't know if therapist can do this but I hope therapist said something like \"your mom sent me an email, let's discuss going no contact with your abuser.\"", "Eating disorders often manifest in complex family dynamics where the food becomes the only thing the person perceives they can control. Every sentence in this suggests you are controlling, punitive and completely lacking in self-awareness and empathy. 100% YTA and you have no ones best interests at heart but your own. Get your own therapist and stop trying to control your daughter, you\u2019ve done enough damage.", "OP's the Mother from Hell. Everything the girl did was wrong, according to her. Not even straight A's got her off the poor daughter's back. I feel so sorry for that girl. YTA", "Yeah. She was able to tell us whatever she wanted.  Spin the story any way she pleases. It boggles the mind that this is the acceptable version of events in her mind.", "Op actions lead to her daughter developing a eating disorder and the mom doesn't even begin to see its her fault for pressing her daughter to be beyond perfect.", "Honestly no, not attempting to contact me anyway. But the rest of how she described her approach to parenting and her relationship with her daughter, yes, definitely. Also there\u2019s totally a correlation between this style of parenting and the development of eating disorders\n\nIf I were in OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s therapist\u2019s position I would contact my client and my supervisor to let them know. Then I\u2019d either not reply at all, or reply explaining why it was inappropriate and why I can\u2019t answer, based on what my client first and foremost, but also the practice I work for is comfortable with me doing.", "So much this. YTA op. Did you also make sure your daughter knew that she was to use NO WIRE HANGERS EVER!!?", "This would make my psychiatrist probably agree to up my meds \ud83d\ude02", ">Oh I bet 99% of those sessions are about the awful, controlling mother who constantly criticised her.\n\nI have a hunch that OP might be at least somewhat aware of this. Her sitting in the visits intimidates the daughter away from talking about it.\n\nYou know what? Now I want to know what the message to the current therapist said. This whole post was complaints about the daughter's \"mistakes\" and OP contacted the therapist because she didn't see progress she personally approved of. I bet the message was full of OP trying to insert her Daughter Is A Failure narrative over the daughter telling the truth.", "Her problem is you. 100% you. Enjoy talking to her while it lasts. Lying and self preservation are two different things.", "This, exactly!", "And then the next. I didn\u2019t know she was pregnant and had MY GRANDCHILD. Why wouldn\u2019t she want me to know? /s", "With the body being \"all i did was tell her the cake was ugly, her dress looked like shit, her hair was going to be garbage, that she gained too much weight, that the band selection was dumb, that I didn't really like the fiancee, and that even though I am not paying for it, I would call and cancel all these things if she didn't take my 'advice'. Why she no love me tho? It's obviously not me. Nope. I'm the epitome of perfection. A god among women. She must have a drinking problem.\" OP is just the most incredible almost assuredly ACTUAL narcissist (big N), and huge YTA, but I doubt they'll hear any of this.", "True  I don't think OP's meddling is going to further her narrative or help her cause.", "Too bad HIPAA doesn't have a right of private action. Nothing like being sued into oblivion to get your priorities in order.", "It\u2019s crazy!", "Fair. More specifically, someone else\u2019s therapy is about what THEY want and need.

Or even without family therapy if that\u2019s what she\u2019d rather.", "Sad thing too is if the daughter is purging and not getting proper treatment it will do life long damage to her body.

I believe that people like op are not trying to make themselves look good. It's just that they're so out of touch with reality that they truly do not think they're the problem.", "There is certainly a chance of that, hopefully the therapist would make it clear this is a time to listen and learn in order to repair their relationship. But if not, or if it doesn\u2019t get through, at least the daughter can be assured she tried and is only more justified in going NC."]}
