She used to fly in and stay with my husband\u2019s twin, but since we bought a house with a guest bedroom she splits her time between both houses.\n\nThe problem is I don\u2019t want her staying here anymore. She tends to overstay her welcome (she\u2019ll make \u201cloose\u201d plans to stay two nights then stay 5) and will randomly change the days she\u2019s coming, making my life very difficult. She will change her dates to times we have meetings or plans and expect us to accommodate her. I\u2019ve started being extremely clear about when we are free, which has mostly worked.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t fix the main issue for me, which is that she\u2019s very nitpicky. She\u2019s kind of a micromanager and will criticize my home in the name of \u201chelping.\u201d If there\u2019s a mug on the table, she\u2019ll ask if we\u2019re done and if that should be our away. God forbid she finds something expired in the fridge. Or if our dogs make a mess ripping up her toy on the floor, she wants me to immediately vacuum it up (and kind of gives me the stink eye if I don\u2019t) when I might do it a few hours later. She corrects me when I\u2019m washing dishes (\u201cuse the other side of the sponge for that pan,\u201d) mentions areas where the furniture doesn\u2019t match, and does a double take at any small pile of clutter, like yesterdays mail out on the counter. The comments basically imply that I should be cleaning that so then I just do it and never get a break. It\u2019s like I always have to be \u201con\u201d in my home.\n\nShe\u2019s honestly not the worst otherwise and does try to help us. But I just can\u2019t deal - even having her over for a few nights makes me sick beforehand. I feel like my house isn\u2019t mine while she\u2019s here and I can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s mine again. I honestly want to not have her stay at all anymore, which I know isn\u2019t really done and would cause a lot of issues in the family. And sometimes I DO feel like I\u2019m overreacting - I don\u2019t know why I have so much trouble with house guests when other people seem fine with it. But I truly dread anytime she (or anyone else, but she comes the most) stays over. So WIBTA if I (and my husband) tell my MIL she can no longer stay? \n\nMy husband is more easygoing and gets less upset by these comments but sees how much it upsets me so he wouldn\u2019t mind setting more strict boundaries. But I told my good friend and she thought that I should definitely not do this unless I want to lose the family and relationship completely. She said this is just what families do. She even got upset about the idea making me very nervous", "created_utc": 1682734564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132gnnt/wibta_if_i_tell_my_mil_she_cant_stay_at_our_house/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you go from not saying anything about how you feel to saying she can't come over ever, I'd give you a minor AH rating, mostly because your MIL can't change her behaviors if she doesn't know they're bothering you, so if her behaviors are the reason you don't want her in your home, you should set clear boundaries first. If she keeps behaving the same way after talking to her though, then you could kick her out and still be NTA.", "NTA.  Be \"unavailable\" when she comes around, let your husband deal with her.

He\u2019s the one who needs to set the boundaries.

It seems that your issue is not with MIL but with any guests and your husband understands it. Getting him to talk to his mother would be much better idea than telling her yourself.  However, both of you should be prepared that most likely it will affect yours (and your husband's) reletenshi with MIL. It is your right to do it but do not be blind to consequences", "There really is no need to BTA.  I would still let her stay, but for God's sake put some rules and boundaries you can live with.  No assholes.\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. At all. However. I would be lying if I told you that not allowing her to stay at your house anymore wouldn't affect the family dynamics. Have you and your husband ever sat down and spoken to MIL about her behavior and how it makes you feel? I feel like you should at least try that if you haven't already, especially since she might not even realize how ridiculous she is being. But if you have been ignored in the past or the behavior is unchanged after a conversation, then I would definitely be limiting her time in my home.", "NTA\n\nIt's your home, you and hubby decide who stays and who doesn't. \n\nYour friend is wrong. That is not how family, parents, in-laws act. That isn't how any guest should act, and that's exactly what she is, a guest.\n\nPersonally, I'd let her have a coronary over my \"messes\" and enjoy her discomfort while I ignored her actions, judgments, and expectations that my house should meet her standards. If she doesn't like the way you keep house she can go home. And I absolutely would not let her clean or rearrange anything in my home. But I'm bitchy like that.", "It\u2019s a MIL.

When she asks about picking up dishes it sounds like she's only being helpful. If you aren't cleaning up your dog's messes on the floor right away that's pretty gross. You haven't described anything too outrageous that she's doing aside from not sticking to the timeframes for staying, which I agree is very annoying. Even though your husband is laid back, he should be doing more to make your MIL's visits less stressful for you. He needs to address these issues with her so that she sticks to the plans she gives you and tones down her behavior when she visits.", "Gentle YTA.  Having company - especially overnight company - can be stressful.  I get it.  However, it\u2019s really not fair to MIL or, more importantly, YOUR HUSBAND, to insist that his mother never stay in your home again.  \n\n\nSometimes when we have a load of family staying (big family gatherings multiple times a year) I used to have to just go to my room and read for half an hour here and there.

It's understandable that you feel uncomfortable with your MIL's behavior and it's important to set boundaries for your own well-being.

When I need to distract a certain somebody I get out the secret bag of 'favorite snack', start channel surfing, make sure I linger on something they like for a second, keep surfing, then I say something about checking on the laundry or return an email, whatever in another room. Works like a charm. I can usually buy at least an hour.\n\nI also set a meal plan and schedule, leaving gaps for them to fill in with their favorites.
