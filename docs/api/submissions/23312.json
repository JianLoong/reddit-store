Glad I am an only child after reading that. As for your sister, it wasn't that you flaunted anything. You just show to your mom how your husband is treating you. And her husband gives her excuse. I didn't grow up in the richest household. I grow up in a household that had more than its share of money troubles. Although it could have always been worse.

Not only that, but you defended her when your stepdad asked about her getting a ring, by bringing up a completely valid point. Plus, she also can\u2019t get mad at your stepdad. Rings are usually commonplace in marriage (not saying you need one, just that most people get one), so when you don\u2019t buy a ring, people would probably be curious about it. Plus, you came and defended her, it\u2019s not like you said \u2018oh, stepfather, you know this peasant can\u2019t afford a ring\u2019. No. You brought up a completely valid point to your dad\u2019s question. And then her calling you a gold digger, and \u2018oh I\u2019m sooo poor\u2019.

I'd like to see society get to a point where it's an actual choice for everyone and not a budgetary constraint, but then - I'm in my fifties and I'd still like a pet unicorn, and that's probably about as likely to happen.
