Until then, it's best for you two to steer clear of each other.

She is 100% in the wrong \n\nAlso on a side note obviously economically speaking a lot of people are struggling right now (inflation, stagnant wages and so on) There could be people in your life struggling right now that you are not aware of (most ppl keep that to themselves) I personally don\u2019t think you were flaunting your anniversary gift at all but just some advice its good to be mindful of others especially those who may be having a hard time financially.", "NTA. Glad I am an only child after reading that. As for your sister, it wasn't that you flaunted anything. You just show to your mom how your husband is treating you. And her husband gives her excuse. I didn't grow up in the richest household. I grow up in a household that had more than its share of money troubles. Although it could have always been worse.

First off, being a SAHM is one of the hardest jobs in the world, and you never get time off, so I got no idea why she said you\u2019ve never worked a day in your life, when realistically you work the same, if not more than her. Not only that, but you defended her when your stepdad asked about her getting a ring, by bringing up a completely valid point. Plus, she also can\u2019t get mad at your stepdad. Rings are usually commonplace in marriage (not saying you need one, just that most people get one), so when you don\u2019t buy a ring, people would probably be curious about it. Plus, you came and defended her, it\u2019s not like you said \u2018oh, stepfather, you know this peasant can\u2019t afford a ring\u2019. No. You brought up a completely valid point to your dad\u2019s question. And then her calling you a gold digger, and \u2018oh I\u2019m sooo poor\u2019.

She\u2019s clearly struggling and having her father make comments like that while you admittedly are showing off your wealth/gifts to your mother. Money was indeed a factor in your marriage, you got with a man 11 years your senior in your early 20 and live the luxury life without working for it, you are in an extremely privileged position. I don\u2019t think it excuses her behaviour but I really would give her some understanding here, does she see you as the golden child? If you are favoured a lot more throughout her life it can cause a huge amount of built up resentment. She didn\u2019t walk into the conversation, your step father threw her into the conversation by insulting her. Shes likely has been compared to you by him multiple times whilst having her daughter blame her for not being rich enough/marrying a wealthy man.
