I got married and had my kids (6F, 4M and 2F) soon after graduating from college, so I\u2019ve never had a real job. I was planning on working for a couple years and had a few job offers but my daughter happened sooner than we\u2019d planned so I decided to just stay home. \n\nWhile it is quite nice that I can afford to stay home, money was definitely not the main reason why I married my husband. I love him because of his personality. \n\nMy stepsister (30F) has three children (7F, 6M, and 1M). I babysit them fairly often. A few days ago my parents had a barbecue at their house. My fifth anniversary was a few weeks ago and my husband got me a diamond eternity band and tennis bracelet. I was showing those to my mom when my stepfather and stepsister walked over. My stepdad asked my stepsister when she\u2019s getting a ring. She gave me a dirty look and said \u201cnot everybody can afford to waste thousands of dollars on a shiny rock.\u201d I tried to be the bigger person and told my stepdad that she doesn\u2019t need a ring and it\u2019s obvious that her boyfriend loves her a lot whether she has one or not.\n\nShe told me to f*ck off with my fake sympathy. I asked her if she woke up on the wrong side of the bed today and she said \u201cSome people actually have things to worry about. A useless little gold digger who\u2019s never worked a day in her life wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d I was quite offended but I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just smiled and told her to tell me if she needs help with anything. She said that she doesn\u2019t need my charity and accused me of trying to make her and her family feel bad by flaunting my expensive jewelry. I reminded her that she chose to walk over and join our conversation. \n\nShe said that it\u2019s hard to feel happy when she and boyfriend still rent a house and can\u2019t afford special stuff for themselves and their kids while working long hours. I was done with her bs so I basically told her that that\u2019s their problem and theirs nothing I can do about that. She said that her kids feel awful when they see all the nice things my kids have and her daughter really wanted to be a ballerina and do gymnastics but she can\u2019t afford it so she has to watch her cousin do everything she dreamed of doing. \n\nI told her to stop being a jealous b*tch and said that if she doesn\u2019t want her kids to be jealous then I won\u2019t babysit them anymore. She called me insensitive and said that I\u2019ve always been given everything I want and I\u2019m spoiled. I didn\u2019t want to engage with her anymore so I left to talk to my sister in law. My stepsister left the barbecue immediately after that and is still mad at me. My mother thinks I should apologize.

Especially when you defended her, and you regularly babysit her children. You're perfectly within your rights to defend yourself, and it is you who is owed the apology.\n\nTell your mother that you didn't start this fight, and you're not going to apologise for finishing it, but you will accept her apology when she's ready to give it. Until then, it's best for you two to steer clear of each other. And don't babysit for her until she apologises", "NTA obviously \n\nClearly your step sister is going through some financial issues and is lashing out at you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and she should be the one to apologize since she clearly started this confrontation and escalated it. She is 100% in the wrong \n\nAlso on a side note obviously economically speaking a lot of people are struggling right now (inflation, stagnant wages and so on) There could be people in your life struggling right now that you are not aware of (most ppl keep that to themselves) I personally don\u2019t think you were flaunting your anniversary gift at all but just some advice its good to be mindful of others especially those who may be having a hard time financially.", "NTA. Glad I am an only child after reading that. As for your sister, it wasn't that you flaunted anything. You just show to your mom how your husband is treating you. And her husband gives her excuse. I didn't grow up in the richest household. I grow up in a household that had more than its share of money troubles. Although it could have always been worse. Yet I can't remember when my dad or mom didn't grab random gifts for eachother. Or even saved up for christmas or birthdays to get eachother a really nice gift. But it sounds like her husband doesn't even do that for her. That is her problem not yours.", "NTA. First off, being a SAHM is one of the hardest jobs in the world, and you never get time off, so I got no idea why she said you\u2019ve never worked a day in your life, when realistically you work the same, if not more than her. Not only that, but you defended her when your stepdad asked about her getting a ring, by bringing up a completely valid point. Plus, she also can\u2019t get mad at your stepdad. Rings are usually commonplace in marriage (not saying you need one, just that most people get one), so when you don\u2019t buy a ring, people would probably be curious about it. Plus, you came and defended her, it\u2019s not like you said \u2018oh, stepfather, you know this peasant can\u2019t afford a ring\u2019. No. You brought up a completely valid point to your dad\u2019s question. And then her calling you a gold digger, and \u2018oh I\u2019m sooo poor\u2019. She sounds jealous af.", "Um, apologize for what? What exactly would your mom like you to say in this apology? Your step sis was rude, very rude. And yes, she's clearly jealous. You don't have to be accommodating to people who attack you. NTA.", "From your description, NTA. \nInfo: why does your mom think you should apologize?", "NTA. Don't babysit. She doesn't appreciate it", " NTA but I think your step dad has a bigger part in this than you think. How often does he make comments like this? She\u2019s clearly struggling and having her father make comments like that while you admittedly are showing off your wealth/gifts to your mother. Money was indeed a factor in your marriage, you got with a man 11 years your senior in your early 20 and live the luxury life without working for it, you are in an extremely privileged position. I don\u2019t think it excuses her behaviour but I really would give her some understanding here, does she see you as the golden child? If you are favoured a lot more throughout her life it can cause a huge amount of built up resentment. She didn\u2019t walk into the conversation, your step father threw her into the conversation by insulting her. Shes likely has been compared to you by him multiple times whilst having her daughter blame her for not being rich enough/marrying a wealthy man. You\u2019re NTA but know she did hit some truths there.", "> money was definitely not the main reason why I married my husband\n\nThis is a strange comment to make after posting about being a \"gold digger\". Money not the \"main\" reason you married, but it was a factor?", "YTA you aren't bad for having money but that wasn't necessary to say those things her. obviously she was reacting to the insensitive question from her dad. I am sure she is jealous to an extent but it makes sense if you think about it.. maybe her kids really are missing out? It is family so I would apologize for my part.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It sounds like you're doing what you can to be nice about it. I hope she doesn't make her children as resentful as she is. hopefully, you can keep on watching them. \nThe problem with sibling rivalry is that it can spill on to the children of the siblings if left unchecked.", "NTA she is so wrong.

Your stepsister basically said you and your husband aren't the kind of influence she wants around herself or her children. It would only be right to stop babysitting for her.\n\nShe's obviously got problems to deal with in her own life. It's not fair to take them out on you. She started it, you tried to be the bigger person and she wouldn't give up. She can take what she dished out, and she can eat what she made.

Some people don\u2019t want to be the main financial provider and they want a partner that can meet them half way.\n\nEdit: or they find out they have horrible credit, which could hinder their future plans, horrible spending habits that could lead them into debt, etc.", "Realistically, money *should* be a factor in who you see and whether you get married. Not to say every partner needs to be rich, but one of the leading causes of divorce is financial issues & financial incompatibility. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for OP or anyone else to want to be with a financially stable person. \n\nThis goes for both men and women. Financial stability is important for having a solid future and good financial foundation.", "Yes, I agree with what you're saying in relation to financial issues playing a big part in divorce, but, it is something that realistically should be discussed prior to marriage (I know it isn't and hence the divorce rate due to it) - perhaps I just got lucky with mine.\n\n But still, I find the comment that money was not the \"main reason\" for getting married as strange."]}
