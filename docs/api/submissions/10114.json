I've worked incredibly hard for a long time to achieve this goal and it's something I'm incredibly proud of. I am the first member of my family to even attend college, let alone attain an advanced degree. My parents are very proud of me as well and their support means a lot to me. My parents suggested throwing a party to celebrate my achievement. Nothing extravagant, just a gathering of friends and family.\n\nWe started planning the party about 2 months ago and scheduled it for this past Saturday. When we were talking to people about schedule conflicts, my older brother (30M) and his wife (31F) mentioned that anything in the middle of the day from 1-4 would be difficult for them because that's when their 2 young children (3 & 1) take their naps. He asked that we do something in the morning like a brunch.\n\nWe tried to accommodate them, but with everyone else's schedules and the fact that their schedule was literally in the middle of the day, it was difficult. We ended up deciding on an early dinner and rented a private room at a restaurant from 3-5. My brother and his wife also live 2 hours away so they rarely come to see any family to begin with since they've had kids. We didn't even see them for Thanksgiving or Xmas this year.\n\nI contacted my brother directly and told him how much it would mean to me for him and his wife to come celebrate this with me. I apologized for the timing of the event, but explained that was the time that worked best for people with the fewest conflicts. He said they would try to make it work, but he couldn't promise they would be there.\n\nLast week, he told me that he didn't think they would be able to make it and wanted to tell me in advance. When I asked why, he told me that it just wasn't going to work for their schedules. When I asked for specifics, he said the same thing, that it just wasn't going to work.\n\nBefore people start suggesting ideas, them spending the night somewhere here was also brought up to them, but they shot it down. I still live with my parents in a 2-bedroom apartment, so according to them there isn't enough space for them here. We suggested a hotel for them, but they said both their kids are going through sleep regressions and they aren't comfortable trying to have them sleep in a new space when they are struggling to sleep at home as it is. I told my brother he could come by himself, but he doesn't want to leave his wife with both the kids because their youngest has special needs and it's a lot harder with one parent.\n\nI told my brother that he has an excuse for everything and that if he really wanted to make it to the party to show support, he would. I told him that ever since he had kids, he makes zero effort to be a part of the rest of the family and that if he can't be there for me to celebrate the biggest achievement of his life, then he's an asshole. He told me that I don't have kids so I don't get it. They did not attend the party.", "created_utc": 1676563024, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113tuvd/aita_for_calling_my_brother_and_sil_selfish_and/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother and his wife asked us to plan around their schedule, but we couldn't.  They ended up not coming because we didn't accommodate them.

They have bigger priorities than you passing the bar exam, get over yourself.", "Congrats on passing the bar.\n\nYour brother can\u2019t make it and pushing for why isn\u2019t good. They can\u2019t make it work, they can\u2019t make it work. When you ask someone why, you\u2019re putting them in position of explaining why it doesn\u2019t work for them and then need to listen to someone give reasons why it can work and then they need to justify why it doesn\u2019t work for them. Accept the no.\n\nSince you kept asking\u2026.I\u2019ll answer\u2026.\n\nParty is 2 hours away. That\u2019s a long trip round trip with children, who I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re invited or not.\n\nSleep with kids for some can be tricky, some kids sleep in cars, mine didn\u2019t. So it never worked if I decided to go someplace during nap time.\n\nGetting babysitter, they might not have one, I don\u2019t know where you live, but it\u2019s $20 to $25 an hour where I live. That can be a significant expense to consider.\n\nHotel room- expense could be an issue and or the kids don\u2019t do well away from home.\n\nBrother come by himself\u2026.they may be at the point that leaving one with the children for 6-7 hours on a weekend day is too much with other weeekend chores.\n\nYou can come up with all the ways it could work for them, it doesn\u2019t\u2026.at this time. In a year or 2, 3 , things could be different and they may be more flexible.\n\nYou\u2019ve been focused the last few years on your schooling and the bar, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s your goal. But maybe have some understanding for what your brother has been dealing with for the last 3-4 years and the changes in his life.\n\nI was going with NAH until you called him an asshole. Looking for the specific reasons makes you decide whether it is a good enough reason or not. Accept the we can\u2019t make it.\n\nEditing to add YTA for how you reacted.\n\nInfo- did you have a graduation celebration and did your brother acknowledge the graduation\u2026coming, card,gift, etc?", "YTA  I hope that as a lawyer, you understand the difference between an invitation and a summons.  Your brother explained several times what his schedule constraints were and why.  May I suggest that if you want to see your brother and his family at holidays, that you travel to them? I have it on good authority that the distance between your 2 places is the same no matter which way you're going.", "YTA and the world doesn't revolve around you. Surprise! Yes, great you achieved something you wanted. However they specifically said the times they weren't available and you made them...those exact same times when they live TWO hours away. So 4 hours of travel if good conditions when they have a 3 and 1 year old. I wouldn't come either. You sound incredibly selfish and self absorbed.", "YTA. It sucks that he can't come but that's just life. No need to lash out like that.", "Hey, congrats on passing the bar \u2014 that is a huge achievement! That said, you are being the AH here. \n\nPlease do not climb up on that high horse. \n\nIt will lead you down the road of thinking your situation is always more important than other people\u2019s situations and you will start isolating yourself from your loved ones. \n\nAlso, I implore you to do your time as a public defender to make sure you stay human and don\u2019t become the butt of all the lawyer jokes.", "YTA\n\nFour hours on the road for a two-hour luncheon? With young kids who rely on schedules?\n\nCongratulations on your achievement, but you're not the main character. Apologize and never mention it again.", "YTA. You invited him, he can\u2019t make it, leave it alone. No need to press him on specifics. Plus he\u2019s got young children with special needs and lives 2 hours away. Wtf don\u2019t you understand?", "YTA.  You asked for conflicts, he gave you his, you scheduled for the conflicting time anyway, and then you called him names because he can't accommodate you.  It is really, legitimately hard to travel with toddlers, even more so with a special needs child, and you are throwing a tantrum because he won't attend a party.  Who actually looks selfish here?", "Dude.  YTA.  They have BABIES one of which is special needs, live 2 hours away, had no where to stay in your town, weren't able to make it to major holidays, and you wanted them to come hang out with you for TWO HOURS???\n\nI'm not sure what type of law you will be practicing but I hope it's nothing that involves ANY type of empathy or reasoning.  You are definitely lacking in those areas.", "YTA\n\nWhile that is a great achievement, you are pushing on someone else's boundaries numerous times. Yes, you are family, but he has made a family as well. They let you know well in advance that they wouldn't be able to make it and made it clear that they couldn't promise anything. And yeah, you don't understand because you don't have children especially when one has special needs. They are young and it's a 2 hour drive. Why couldn't you have done both seeing them for brunch, a fair middle ground they suggested, and then dinner later with the others?", "YTA. You are coming off incredibly self-centered here.\n\n>I told him that ever since he had kids, he makes zero effort to be a part of the rest of the family\n\nWhen you marry someone and have kids together, THAT is your new immediate family. They live 2 hours away and have 2 kids under 3. This is a lot to ask for a party.", "Info: why can\u2019t you just do brunch with them when it\u2019s convenient to celebrate? \n\nHe isn\u2019t trying to NOT celebrate you. He has children and they are the priority.\nYTA", "YTA \n\nIt was an invite not a summons, they couldn\u2019t make it and instead of accepting that you badgered them and kept asking them to justify it.\n\nNo means no, it\u2019s not complicated", "YTA. If you wanted your brother there so much, you should have planned the party for a time that he could come.  He's been upfront and honest.  His \"excuses\" are valid reasons, and you're being really unsupportive of his situation.", "YTA. Congrats on passing the bar, but he told you in advance they couldn\u2019t make that time and you scheduled it then anyway. You can\u2019t be surprised or mad that he was telling the truth about that. Frankly, be less self-centered. Thousands of people pass the bar every year. (I\u2019m one of them, so I know exactly what it\u2019s like.)", "YTA.\n\nAll of the reasons he gave are very valid. \n\nCongratulations on passing the bar but everyone else's lives don't stop because you achieved something, and calling him selfish because he can't make your celebration is ridiculous. \n\nYou are not the main character in his story.", "YTA. Good grief you are so entitled and demanding.  Congratulations on passing the bar. Learn to deal with minor disappointments in life.", "YTA \n\n\nHe specifically told you when he couldn't make it. Your excuse was \"this time works better for other people\". I know that a 3 hour nap window + a 2 hour drive on side is pretty hard to accommodate but he would have come to a brunch. You can be disappointed but you aren't entitled to their presence. \n\n\nI was never the type of parent to have a perfect nap schedule and just brought my kids wherever/whenever, but some parents are more disciplined than I am. I'm jealous of the magic to get a 3 year old to nap, though. \n\n\nAnd how often do you visit them....?", "This is almost a no assholes here for me, but your persistence in this is what tips me to YTA. \n\nYou did something important. That\u2019s great. You want to celebrate it. Also great. Your brother and his family can\u2019t make it. That\u2019s a shame. Your brother\u2019s an adult who\u2019s made choices in his life. The level of resentment you are demonstrating here about these choices is not a good look.", "Congrats on passing the bar exam but YTA, your party is not the center of the universe.", ">that if he can't be there for me to celebrate the biggest achievement of his life, then he's an asshole\n\nYTA - Firstly you're the AH for being so entitled to think that the universe revolves around you. You scheduled the party for a time they could not make and you completely ignore the fact that one of his kids is special needs. Jeez and wow you.", "YTA.\n\nThey have two young children and are two hours away. This is a minimum 6 hour commitment with young children and not an easy thing to manage.\n\nHe told you it won't work for his schedule. The event being important to you does not entitle you to his time.\n\nCongratulations, though!", "Congratulations on passing the bar! That\u2019s a big achievement, and (from personal experience) something you should be proud of. \n\nThat said, YTA. They told you ahead of time they have a scheduling conflict, you picked a time that didn\u2019t work for them, and then you get mad at them because they can\u2019t make it? Dude, cmon. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be like this when scheduling conferences with opposing counsel", "YTA. I\u2019m a law student so I understand what an incredible achievement it is to pass the bar and how hard you worked to do it. However your brother has two young children, one of whom has special needs and he lives two hours away. It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s not able to make it especially when he told you in advance that he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it if the party was between 1-4pm. You have no right to lash out at him when you know how much he has on his plate. Right now his family needs him more than you do. If you want to celebrate with your brother, why don\u2019t you plan a separate celebration with him and his wife close to where they live?", "YTA. \n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight - you\u2019re not *owed* your brother and his family\u2019s attendance. And attendance doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t have celebrated with you or weren\u2019t excited for you. Your brother was polite, communicated well, and was honest about the restrictions on his time. It\u2019s unfortunate that he couldn\u2019t make it work, but he was in no way the AH here. \n\nYou, on the other hand, were rude, mean, and incredibly self-centered. Get over yourself.", "YTA. It's not a particularly important event to anyone but you - sorry, but it's not. It's not a wedding, it's not a funeral. They have 2 very young children, one with 'special needs' as you've said yourself. The world doesn't revolve around you and they've more than within their right to decline.", "YTA. I understand that it was disappointment that your brother and his family weren't able to attend, but he gave you plenty of advanced notice and reasonable explanations why they wouldn't be there. It's obvious that you haven't taken care of small children, which is difficult enough on it's own and made even harder with a special needs child. He told you when they were available and you chose a different time because it worked for the majority of the other people, so it shouldn't have come as a surprise that they wouldn't be there. Did you ask to have them join a video call during your party?", "Yta , they told you way in advance what their schedule is like. You should\u2019ve understood that they wouldn\u2019t be able to when you chose the time you did ( which is totally understandable and your choice ). Congratulations on your degree but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and ppl have bigger responsibilities than attending a party.", "YTA - emphatically.  Your brother has his own family.  He knows what's best for them, and it sounds like things aren't easy for him right now.  Having a 3 and 1 year old is difficult under the best circumstances.  Throw in a few loops, money troubles, behavior troubles, special needs, etc, and the idea of losing a day for a party just doesn't add up.  Congratulations on your success in law school and passing the bar!  That can't be understated, but I think you owe your brother an apology.", "Yta\n\nEach reason he gave sounds pretty valid to me. Youre acting like a whiny child about this. Have some maturity and realize his life isn't stopping for your biggest achievement ever. \n\nGrow up please.", "YTA.  He told you they couldn't make it in the afternoon, so I'm not sure why you think you can demand he show up when he told you in advance that he can't.\nHaving 2 young children is not easy, add in the special needs and a 2 hour drive each way and it is impossible.", "YTA. \n\nNo where do you show any level of consideration for what your brother is dealing with. It's all about you. The fact he lives two hours away, has small children and the event is planned for an inconvenient time as noted to you previously.... doesn't matter he should be there in your eyes. The world does not revolve around your desires.", "YTA. You can\u2019t make people do things. If you want to see him so bad why haven\u2019t you visited him?  This is obviously about way more than a party.  You are sounding entitled to his time", "They said no. Politely.\n\nYou refused to take no for an answer.\n\nYou turned it into an interrogation. You began browbeating your brother into saying yes.\n\nYTA", "YTA - I have many friends with kids, some don't care about schedules others do and that's entirely up to them how they parent.  Sleep regressions are also very real, and routine can be crucial in getting back on track.", "YTA if you wanted him there you would have listened to him and not booked it during the hours he said he couldn't do.", "YTA.\n\nThey told you they couldn't make that timing, and you picked it anyway. That's on you.", "I N F O OP, why do you think the world revolves around you? Because it doesn't. \n\nYTA your brother and his family have very valid reason for not attending, and even if he didn't, NO IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE.", "Surprise surprise the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Grow up. YTA", "Your brother: hey i can't attend if the event is in this specific time period \nYou: [sets the event exactly in that specific time period]\nBrother: sorry i can't attend\nYou: OMG YOU'RE SO SELFISH \n\nYTA", "YTA I'm sure you'll make a wonderful lawyer \ud83e\udd23", "YTA, your brother told you times that wouldn\u2019t work for them, you scheduled it conflicting knowing that. This isn\u2019t a major life event that requires his presence. You invited him, you don\u2019t get to be upset when they decline the invite. You were already pushing AH territory by demanding reasons.", "YTA\n\nAs a father of a toddler, I can say that his concerns are absolutely valid. The only - *only* \\- question I'd have is about the complete unavailability of baby sitters. But then, I don't think I would have left my one-year old with a baby sitter back then. You do not have kids, and so you do not get it.\n\nThe world does not bend for you. Perhaps they have something in the back of their mind about recognizing your achievement. Well, until you told him he's an asshole for not putting celebration of passing the bar exam before his own children.\n\nI certainly would not have demanded people with very young kids throw caution to the wind and drag them, almost certain to melt down the entire time from exhaustion, when I passed the bar exam.", "YTA, he informed you from the beginning that the time wouldn't work for him. And it was decent of him to warn you in advance that he couldn't make it. If you wanted him to be there so badly, you could have made it a brunch instead.", "YTA. Your brother was honest with you and said he likely couldn't attend unless it worked in the family schedule. You scheduled it so that they would be driving right when they said they couldn't attend. Plus it is an invite, not a summons. He responded no and you harassed him about it. No is no. He couldn't make it. He gave several valid reasons even when no reason was necessary. You just wouldn't accept the no or his reasons.", "YTA. Yes you did something big FOR YOU. The family that can celebrate your success, great that the could attend but your brother has commitments to his children. He\u2019s a parents and then your brother, he doesn\u2019t need to be physically next to you, drive two hours each way, and make the rest of the day hell (because the children will make it hell fue to the lack of naps) just to show you his support. You are very self centered, hope when you\u2019re representing your clients you can see ALL sides of an argument and make better judgements x", "YTA they specifically told you when they couldn\u2019t make it and you scheduled it for exactly that time and now are pissed that they can\u2019t make it. You have had a big achievement. Congrats! But that doesn\u2019t mean everybody else\u2019s lives need to stop for you.", "YTA. They told you their only conflict, and that's when you scheduled it for. They have small children, and it's a 2 hour drive. \n\nYour brother probably could have tried harder to come on his own, but it would have been a long, difficult day for him, and he'd just be worried about his wife and kids the whole time. \n\nYou didn't mention whether you'd made any effort in the past few years to go visit your brother where he lives, btw.", "YTA bro.\n\nYou: hey the part is going to be at this time, that you said you can\u2019t make because everyone else can. I\u2019d love if you made it.\n\nHim: we\u2019ll try to make it, but no promises\u2026\n\nHim a week in advance: sorry bro, not going to make it just doesn\u2019t work with our schedules (a.k.a outside of not working with their schedules was the only explanation you deserved or were owed and you weren\u2019t even owed that) \n\nYou: HOW DARE YOU NOT COME TO MY PARTY AFTER YOU SAID YOU WEREN\u2019T GOING TO?!", "YTA\n\nYou invited your brother and his wife to your party.  They have two toddlers.  Your party didn\u2019t work for their schedule.  Your brother and his family live two hours away.  You live with your parents.  Your brother and his family don\u2019t come see you very often.  With two toddlers, can you think of a reason why besides your sense of entitlement?  Could you see him while you were in school?  You had your priorities then with more pressing priorities coming in the future.  Your brother has his own set of priorities, yet you call him selfish for putting his own priorities over anyone else\u2019s.", "I was wondering from the beginning is one of the children had special needs. And yep! It is SO HARD to disrupt young kids' routine. It is just a nightmare when the child has special needs. It seems like just one day out of routine, but it takes several to recover afterwards. Additionally, even if they brought the children, how well would they be able to participate in the celebration? In my experience it is not at all.\n\nEdit to add judgment. YTA. It is a bummer, sure. But it seems like you are not in tune with your brother's life at all.", "YTA. Passing the bar is a huge deal, and congratulations on that! But just because someone is invited somewhere does not mean they are obligated to attend. If it was that important to you to have them there, you would\u2019ve planned something around their availability. If it was that important to you to celebrate with them in some way, you would\u2019ve planned something else with them that they could accommodate. But no. He told you in advance. He warned you well in advance of his availability. Knowing this you planned it for a certain time he\u2019d be unavailable for anyway. You don\u2019t get to do that then throw a fit because he couldn\u2019t make it. And he\u2019s right. Until you have kids you won\u2019t get it.", "YTA. I completely understand wanting to celebrate achievements with family, and congratulations on passing the bar. However, an invitation is not a summons and they have valid reasons to say it\u2019s too difficult for them to attend. Even if they simply didn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s also fine. Trying to force the issue and guilt them is what\u2019s working against you the most.", "YTA. Passing the bar exam is great and all, but you're being really entitled and self-centered to expect that other people are going to rearrange their whole lives to celebrate this. I can't believe you are expecting your brother to stay in a hotel for this party.\n\nYou invited him. He said it won't work with his schedule and gave perfectly valid reasons why. Let it go.", "YTA - kids or not I prolly would have just said congratulations I\u2019m proud of you but it\u2019s 2 hours away then send you a nice card and some flowers. Other peoples time is not yours to control. If he didn\u2019t want to come he didn\u2019t want to come, you have to accept that and move on.", "YTA. He has small kids and you scheduled things when he wasn\u2019t going to be available. Idk why you expect otherwise. He doesn\u2019t need to be there to be proud of your accomplishment. \n\nThat being said I does sound like he is distant and I get why you\u2019re upset.", "The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. You know he wasn\u2019t going to make it, because he told you in advance that he has a very tight schedule during the day to attend. It\u2019s not an excuse, he\u2019s telling you how it is. Your passing on the bar exam does not hold as high of a priority as the welfare of his kids and wife.\n\nYTA", "YTA- but a soft YTA.\n\nFirstly, I've realised that big personal achievements are just that, personal- other people just don't care as much. \n\nSecondly, trying to plan anything around young kids is a nightmare, especially seeing as this would be a ~6hr round trip", "YTA. Congrats on your achievement, it is a huge milestone in your life. But damn, who drives two hours each way for a dinner? Even without the toddlers, that's a ridiculous ask. With the toddlers, it ranges from impractical to impossible. You know the saying \"this meeting could have been an email\"? So could your dinner", "YTA. You need to grow up.", "YTA. You literally tried to strong-arm your brother into attending even though he and his wife politely declined your invitation. He is right in saying you don't know what life is like with children. Their needs always come first.", "Did you offer to pay for a sitter?\n\nYTA\n\nLife happens.", "YTA. Congratulations on your achievement but saying they're deliberately making excuses is out of line. Kids make everything more difficult, especially if they are going through sleep regressions aswell! You need to grow up a little.", "YTA. All that education, and you're still this clueless? He has kids. It means that everything else gets shifted down on the list of priorities. It's ok to be disappointed, but your response was flat out selfish", "Huge congratulations on passing the bar! \ud83c\udf89 You should be so proud of yourself and enjoy your party! \n\nYou need to decide if you\u2019re able to detach from your brothers inability to attend. It\u2019s not about you. As someone without kids, I know it can feel hurtful when people with kids seem to completely ignore you in favor of them. That\u2019s a product of a kid centric society we\u2019ve created and lack of support for parents to be able to do much of anything in those first 1-2 years. Unfortunately, it means that your brother can\u2019t show up for you. \n\nAs the adults, we are expected to \u201csuck it up\u201d and we do, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt. I\u2019m sorry about the hurt. \n\nIf there have been previous signs that your bro is unsupportive or jealous or there\u2019s a deeper reason he might not want to attend, that\u2019s worth addressing with him. But from what you\u2019ve said, this really does just seem like a logistical issue and respectfully, you kind of chose it. \n\nYou said 3-5 was the timing that worked for others, but that means you chose those other people\u2019s ability to attend over your brother\u2019s. Are their schedules more important? Are they in tougher positions financially or logistically than your brother? Or, are they close friends who it\u2019s really important for you to accommodate? All of these are fine, but you have to acknowledge that you chose who you would ask to move plans around for you, and you gambled wrong, so to speak.", "YTA for calling him an asshole. i get wanting him to be there, but you scheduled the party during the exact time they said wouldn't work for them so thats on you.\n\n>I still live with my parents in a 2-bedroom apartment, so according to them there isn't enough space for them here.\n\nthis sentence is hilarious. \"according to them there isn't enough space\" like thats an unreasonable belief. a 2 bedroom apartment is *objectively* not enough space for 5 adults and 2 babies.\n\nedit: word", "YTA\n\nCongratulations on passing the bar Op, it really is a big achievement, but you are acting a little bratty. You invited them to your party, they have valid reasons not to attend. you can't force them to come. \n\nYou don't have kids so you absolutely don't get it. You don't mess with toddlers and their sleep patterns. It is hard enough for new parents, they have two very small kids and maybe their sleep schedules are finally bringing peace to their family unit. Two kids under 3 sounds like the parents must finally be getting to a place where their children might be starting to sleep through the night, and you really do not want to mess with that. You should try to see it from their perspective.\n\nYes, its a great achievement but you can't expect everyone to drop everything they have going on.", "YTA. He told you he couldn\u2019t come during specific times as he has a family and children. That comes before you always. Plus a two hour drive. Then you get mad at him when he already said it wouldn\u2019t work? Entitled. You got a degree, congratulations but people have lives.", "Jeez... take a hint.\n\nYTA", "YTA he told you when he could go and scheduled it for a different time", "YTA  I don't care if his reason was \" I'm not coming because we're too exhausted from 2 babies ( one is special needs!) And really just want to be left alone\"\n\n\nNo means no.  You can be disappointed but you don't get to be an entitled brat about it.", "Very very soft YTA. I can see your reaction came from a place of disappointment that you can\u2019t celebrate this achievement with someone you truly care about. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nThat being said, he did tell you his stipulations in order to attend and your celebration did not meet those. If you made an effort to accommodate them and they still didn\u2019t show up it would be a totally different story (not that you should have to, but if you don\u2019t you can\u2019t expect them to come)\n\nMaybe suggest celebrating with them separately so you can fully accommodate their schedule without worrying about other guests not making it.", "YTA you literally scheduled it for right when they could not attend and are now mad that they cannot attend? The world does not revolve around you", "YTA", "YTA. You don\u2019t have kids so you don\u2019t get it.", "YTA. Such bratty behaviour. Grow up.", "YTA. If someone can't make it, they can't make it, they don't owe you an explanation. Suggesting ideas nobody asked you for is obnoxious. The comfort of his immediate family is more important to your brother than helping to stroke your ego. Not surprisingly so.", "YTA and one day if you have children you'll realize it.", "I just wanted to say well done for passing the bar because that\u2019s some super hard exam", "Gentle YTA his priorities have changed and that's okay, it doesn't make him an asshole. \n\nCongratulations on passing the bar, it is a big achievement and your brothers presence or lack thereof does not diminish that.", "YTA.  This isn't a wedding, it's a party celebrating you passing the bar.  This hardly warrants a party lol.", "1st congrats on your degree and passing the bar.\n\nI would cut your brother some slack, young kids can be a handful and with a special needs child it is worse.  They might be terrible at this age in a car and 2 hours each way could be a real pain.\n\nI would say NAH\n\nHas the family drove to see the brother and his family?  It goes both ways.", "NAH. You are not wrong for being disappointed that your brother could not celebrate with you. Your brother is not wrong in prioritizing his family over your party. He told you in advance and explained his situation. You refuse to believe it\u2019s a viable excuse. I totally get that you\u2019re hurt and this seems to be bothering you beyond just this family gathering. I would question how often anyone makes the two hour trip to go see them/their family.", "YTA. You just passed the bar exam and already you're an arrogant AH. Amazing how quickly that works.", "ESH\n\nYour brother lives 2 hours away and has 2 small children. He also told you explicitly that between 1-4 does not work, and you schedule it within that window. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like they never make an effort and it would be tiring after a while of never feeling like you matter enough for them to make an effort.", "YTA.\n\nBut, hey, why don't you just sue them?", "NAH\n\nCongratulations on passing! \n\nI can see it would be very disappointing and hurtful that it appears they aren't making an effort but the fact they never seem to come home on would say you most certainly aren't the problem. \n\nKids are adjustable and if you where an hour or less away then I would say they are being unreasonable, if you kids will only sleep in one place your setting yourself up for a special kind of hell. \n\nBut your a few hours away that's hard, when you have to drive with tired kids etc it's not easy. \n\nPerhaps a compromise would have worked better. Moving the dinner closer to them or having a quite brunch a different day with just your parents and them?", "YTA. I took just passed the bar and was the first in my family to go to college let alone law school too. It's a big deal...for you. I'm sure your brother is happy for you and if it was easy to celebrate he would be there. But unless you are planning on getting a high end job and paying for them to have a better quality of life, why does he need to disrupt his families life, travel four hours with younger kids just to celebrate how successful you are?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not going to cost them to not follow their schedule 1 time.", "Hmmm could your brother have attended by himself.  I\u2019m not saying SIL isn\u2019t important but it seems like they could have worked something out so at least he could have attended", "So OP thinks passing the bar is the biggest achievement of their life. I guess life is going downhill from here. They have peaked. I would be sad if I put so much stock in this one thing, making everything to come anticlimactic.", "NTA.  Kids can sleep during the two hour drive at exactly their normal nap time.  It's actually perfect.   And such an early supper makes it doable.  Total inflexibility doesn't make sense.  It is one afternoon in a lifetime.   The kids are not sleeping at home under all perfect conditions anyway.   The kids will be work no matter what,  whether alone at home or surrounded by family.  These are not newborns.  This is not some late night alcohol fest that would be inappropriate.  But this depends on you and your parents paying for the hotel.  If I was them I would drive home though.  Hang out until close to bed time.   Get the kids bathed and jammied before getting back in the car.", "I forget that most people on here are like 14 years old. \n\nNTA. People with kids think that they are the center of the world, then are surprised when they have no friends when they turn 40. You are the first in your family to attend college and get an advanced degree, that is worth celebrating. Traveling 2 hrs, especially in America, is easy. \n\nTo be honest, it sounded like they just didn't want to go.", "NTA. Congratulations on passing the bar!

In the event of future celebrations, just don\u2019t bother inviting him", "NTA-He could have come himself. His wife could handle the kids while they nap and few hours beyond. That is a big event that should be celebrated and he should make some effort to attend instead of finding every excuse not too.", "Nta, as someone who has 2 kids, I go to family events as much as possible, especially if they are planned months in advance and spoken about cause I can prep for it.

I've worked incredibly hard for a long time to achieve this goal and it's something I'm incredibly proud of. I am the first member of my family to even attend college, let alone attain an advanced degree. My parents are very proud of me as well and their support means a lot to me. My parents suggested throwing a party to celebrate my achievement. Nothing extravagant, just a gathering of friends and family.\n\nWe started planning the party about 2 months ago and scheduled it for this past Saturday. When we were talking to people about schedule conflicts, my older brother (30M) and his wife (31F) mentioned that anything in the middle of the day from 1-4 would be difficult for them because that's when their 2 young children (3 & 1) take their naps. He asked that we do something in the morning like a brunch.\n\nWe tried to accommodate them, but with everyone else's schedules and the fact that their schedule was literally in the middle of the day, it was difficult. We ended up deciding on an early dinner and rented a private room at a restaurant from 3-5. My brother and his wife also live 2 hours away so they rarely come to see any family to begin with since they've had kids. We didn't even see them for Thanksgiving or Xmas this year.\n\nI contacted my brother directly and told him how much it would mean to me for him and his wife to come celebrate this with me. I apologized for the timing of the event, but explained that was the time that worked best for people with the fewest conflicts. He said they would try to make it work, but he couldn't promise they would be there.\n\nLast week, he told me that he didn't think they would be able to make it and wanted to tell me in advance. When I asked why, he told me that it just wasn't going to work for their schedules. When I asked for specifics, he said the same thing, that it just wasn't going to work.\n\nBefore people start suggesting ideas, them spending the night somewhere here was also brought up to them, but they shot it down. I still live with my parents in a 2-bedroom apartment, so according to them there isn't enough space for them here. We suggested a hotel for them, but they said both their kids are going through sleep regressions and they aren't comfortable trying to have them sleep in a new space when they are struggling to sleep at home as it is. I told my brother he could come by himself, but he doesn't want to leave his wife with both the kids because their youngest has special needs and it's a lot harder with one parent.\n\nI told my brother that he has an excuse for everything and that if he really wanted to make it to the party to show support, he would. I told him that ever since he had kids, he makes zero effort to be a part of the rest of the family and that if he can't be there for me to celebrate the biggest achievement of his life, then he's an asshole. He told me that I don't have kids so I don't get it. They did not attend the party.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was a learning curve however, and when traditions started changing to accommodate new children and new lifestyles I had a very hard time with it. I hated that after all I do to keep my family together and keep traditions alive I was not being accommodated for (of course bc I\u2019m the easiest to adapt given my lifestyle!) but I\u2019ve decided to be as understanding as I can be of my family members with children as well as invest in those who invest in me. This goes for friends too. I know what it feels like to chase people down to get them to show they love and support you, I\u2019d recommend shifting your priorities to those you don\u2019t have to chase down to support you. I believe you have a right to be upset but your brother also has a right to his own family. \n\nCelebrate your awesome accomplishment and focus on you! I\u2019m sure in a few years you\u2019re going to be the cool, rich auntie that the kids see on major holidays wishing they saw more of you!", "Soft YTA. Congratulations to you, and I get how important this is to you, but he's got to be a good parent. You do not get it, he's right.", "YTA. He told you months ago that certain times wouldn\u2019t work. So what did you do? Schedule the party for the times that don\u2019t work. He owes you no more explanations.\n\nWhile passing the bar exam is an achievement you should be proud of, it\u2019s not an occasion everyone considers worthy enough to rearrange their whole schedules.", "YTA. You're learning an important lesson that even though something amazing happened for you, other people can't, or might not want to, celebrate in a way that suits you. Passing the bar is fantastic but when you have children that takes precedent over everything. Frankly, you're being kind of a brat. If 2 people's not coming ruins a fun day for you then you need to explore why. This is going to happen again in your life for other events, so better start exploring that now.", "YTA - learn to take \"No\" as an answer. That's a long drive, I wouldn't want to do it either. Sometimes we don't go to our relatives that live 1 hour away, if things don't line up.", "YTA.  Sometimes people can't do things, especially when they have young children and one is 'special needs.'  You were the AH by guilting your brother and SIL.  They said they would try, but in the end, said 'No.'  That should have been it.  You should have said you'll miss them and wish them well with their kids.  Apologize for being an AH.", "YTA\nFamily is important. His family also includes his two very young children. You scheduled the celebration for times he said didn't work for him. You're calling him an asshole for not prioritizing you. Meanwhile, you're doing nothing to prioritize him and his family. Driving two hours each way with toddlers (who have missed their naps) to attend an adult event is my personal version of hell.", "You\u2019re right that he has an excuse for everything and all of those excuses seems valid. NAH because excessive whining isn\u2019t asshole material imo.", "YTA \n\nThe persistence and rudeness. They congratulated you on graduating and I bet they hope you do well.\n\nThey have an extremely young family and it can be tough to do certain things. \n\nYikes.", "Yta. My cousin used to give me s*** for not showing up to events and using my kids as an \"excuse\", all the way up until she had her own kids and then realized holy crap it's a hell of a lot harder to do anything with kids. She has since apologized. You should consider apologizing too.", "YTA, and your brother phrased it well: You don't have kids, so you don't get it.\n\nKids are not a hobby that you explore intermittently. They are a job of great importance without a break for 20 years or so.\n\nFurther, you sound like a total pest, giving him the third degree, challenging his reaons, pushing, demanding. Enough, already.", "I was prepared to say N A H but two things pushed you into AH territory. 1) one of the kids is special needs. 2) your persistence and then trying to shame him. \n\nAlso, I might be reading too much into it but you might want to consider your brother is going low contact with your family for some reason.", "NTA...he definitely could have made it but it's obviously not his priority, neither was Thanksgiving or Christmas apparently. Calling a spade a spade does not make one an asshole. Basically on this backwards ass sub, whatever the prevailing opinion, just go the opposite way.", "YTA DONT. FUCK. WITH. NAPS!\n\nFor young kids, if you throw off their nap for one day it can mess up the routine for a week. Especially with regressions. I'm sorry that it didn't work out for them, but please be understanding. Your brother is prioritizing his family. You're extended family now.", "ESH It\u2019s unfortunate but it sounds like there is not much effort on the sibling\u2019s part to keep a relationship with you going. You have to decide how hard you want to work to maintain some kind of relationship, or if you and sibling even want one.", "I\u2019m gonna go against everyone else and say NTA. Your feelings are completely valid and you tried your hardest to offer other solutions but he refused them. Granted, it\u2019s not his fault that his children are going through sleep issues and one has special needs, but if you told him well in advance and expressed your desire to have him present at your event, I think he could\u2019ve planned ahead a bit more, depending on when you told him.", "Honestly NTA. I think this falls under \u2018if they wanted to they would\u2019 kinda thing. You gave them 2 months notice in advance. There are so many solutions to all the problems they told you they have if they wanted to come in the first place. Making an exception just this once to celebrate a sibling\u2019s milestone should not be such a monumental task. \n\nIn the future, just don\u2019t get your hopes up. Invite just to be polite but don\u2019t expect so you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "I'm going with NAH. It sounds like to you, this is as big a deal as a wedding and maybe he doesn't understand that. A huge accomplishment to be celebrated, which is great.\n\n I don't have kids myself and it IS sometimes frustrating trying to work around people's schedules who have kids, but I know enough about kids to realize it's not an excuse, it's an actual disruption. One day of missed naps can take ages to recover.  You are borderline T A for hounding and guilting him. I would just let it go, and do a brunch or dinner with just him and his family to celebrate. \n\nAlso, a two-bedroom house that's already full really isn't much of an option for them... it's a possibility but not a great one. And a hotel for a family is very expensive depending on their finances.", "YTA. Seriously, grow up. I passed the bar exam too and never once expected the other adults in my life to throw me a celebration or drop their lives to come congratulate me. In this profession, passing the bar is just the first stepping stone to being a good lawyer (and one that shouldn't even exist to be honest).  Nobody is going to congratulate you for the long nights, missed holidays, and stress that you're going to live with.  Get used to disappointment if you need a parade every time you do something right.", "He also buries the fact that one of his brothers children has special needs, making a trip like that even more difficult.", "And one of the children he mentioned has special needs! \nOP is TA!", "I was willing to cut op some slack until I saw one of the kids is special needs!", "But why should they have to adjust their plans to him when the brother rarely show up for stuff as is? If I were them I wouldnt add another event just to accommodate them\u2026", "My parents and I visited them twice last year for their kids' birthdays.  Once in June for the 3-year old, and again in October for the 1-year old.", "Well, Op's brother has a child with special needs and OP knows this, so I think OP is a little bit of an AH.", "Except that isn't what happened, that schedule worked best for everyone else attending the part. Brother and SIL wanted a brunch party instead. It sounded like every attempt to placate brother and SIL was met with an excuse.", "I disagree that no reason was necessary. Wtf is this attitude that we\u2019ve developed where nobody owes anybody anything anymore? I think for a sibling (barring some falling out) you do everything you can to be there for them and you certainly owe them a reason. Bro gave one and it\u2019s valid, so that\u2019s not the point, but this attitude of \u201che doesn\u2019t owe you anything\u201d is just as entitled as OP\u2019s behavior.", "Oh no, too busy to get important law degree, the first in the family, you see.", "I\u2019m a mom and although I try to attend events where possible, traveling is tough when the kids are young, and the cost benefit balance usually isn\u2019t there. Either brother travels alone and leaves the wife and kids behind for a full day and possibly over night, or they travel with the kids and have a shitty time at the party because the kids were fussy after two hours in the car. If they don\u2019t drive home that night, it means a hotel where no one sleeps because sometimes kids can\u2019t handle a sleep disruption well. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than party or no party.", "OP also dropped in the last paragraph that \u201cthe youngest child has special needs.\u201d I was sort of feeling ESH b/c the Brother also skipped XMas and Thanksgiving, so I thought he was just kind of distant & not willing to put in any effort\u2026 but they have a kid *with special needs*! That totally changes the dynamic.", "You don't need to have kids to get it", "First in the family to get an advance degree, I think she deserves a little party :)\n\nedit to fix he /she - sorry OP", "OP you absolutely deserve a party. Passing the Bar is huge achievement, congrats. Having said that not everyone has to attend it.", "Agreed, especially because the kids can always nap at the house.", "with 2 young children in sleep regressions? yes, yes it absolutely will.", "OP addressed that in the post\u2026", "Look, OP is in the wrong, but this is condescending and makes you look like you\u2019re ragging on people for celebrating big events because *you* don\u2019t think they\u2019re important. Idk if that\u2019s how you meant it, and I kinda hope it\u2019s not, but that\u2019s how you come off.", "How sad your life must be that you feel the need to go on the internet and talk down to people about being proud of achieving something they worked incredibly hard to attain.  My apologies for not including the words \"so far\" at the end of that sentence.  Would that have made you think twice about discounting years of hard work?  Doubtful.  I hope one day you find yourself at a place in your life where you are free of the self-loathing that is clearly causing you to bemoan others of their achievements to take attention away from the fact that you have achieved nothing in your own life.", "Have you ever taken care of a special needs child? It\u2019s not as simple as you\u2019re making it out to be. It\u2019s tough to keep them on a routine on a regular day so messing with that routine is a recipe for disaster.", "The suggestions being \"shell out for a hotel, and have your 1 and 3 year old sleep somewhere unfamiliar\" and \"leave your wife at home with both kids to drive for 4 hours to go to a 2 hour event.\"", "If you read the entire post, I'm confused as to how this could be your takeaway", "It\u2019s not that easy bro", "He lives 2 hours away with 2 young kids, one of which has special needs. Get a grip.", "Ok? And if he doesn\u2019t want to see them he doesn\u2019t have to. Sucks for OP but that\u2019s life", "She. OP is female.", "Not the whole plans.. still have the party they planned with who could come, but have brunch with brother and SIL..\n\nI am also someone who passed the bar. But my siblings live in different states and couldn\u2019t come to the celebration my parents hosted. we celebrated when it worked for them.", "You need to learn to not take things so personally. Grown adults are busy, especially those with kids. Things change. It doesn\u2019t mean your brother doesn\u2019t love you or isnt proud of you, but his kids come first now. It is what it is. Im sure you canceled plans with friends and family while in law school to study and when you had to prepare for the Bar. \n\nYou\u2019re acting like a brat. \n\nYTA", "Wow, a whole 2x in a year!", "I was about to ask how much effort *you* are putting in to support *his* life but this answers that.  As a childless person with lots of friends and family who have young kids, I\u2019ve accepted that I have the ability to be much more flexible, and it\u2019s going to be on me to reach out/travel/accommodate their schedules during this period of our lives. It\u2019s just how it is.
