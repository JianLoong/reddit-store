I cannot believe she would uninvite you from her wedding and then wonder why you are not okay with that.  She cannot decide it's time for you to get over it.  Maybe she will find a way to truly let you know how sorry she is and then you can open up to her again. NTA.", "NTA.  I understand your position and I can imagine the pain that put you through.  You don't know if her bio-father put undue pressure on her to exclude you, it's not an excuse, but that could be a factor.\n\nNow that you got your point across, be open to reconciliation.", "ESH. She behaved poorly then. You're choosing to behave poorly now.", "NTA for being hurt and upset. A bit of YTA with the toast exclusion. I think you should consider talking to her and try to repair your relationship with someone you considered your daughter for most of her life and a significant chunk of your life. This is a fairly common issue where an absent parent shows up after years and a child starts to gravitate towards them thinking they are the best thing ever. They start to wonder if they had been misled or if the person has changed for the better. So the child starts to be influenced by the recently returned parent into doing things that are out of character. From my experience this normally only lasts for a while as the absent parent will start to fall back into bad habits and show who they are and the kid will realize this person isn\u2019t that great after all and that they hurt the people that actually cared about them and raised them.", "ESH talk to her, go to therapy together. There is a positive way out of this mess but only if you are willing to try.", "NTA. But you should try to reconcile with her. She\u2019s clearly acknowledged that she made a mistake and is trying to repair it. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to let her back in if you really don\u2019t want to, but it sounds like she was manipulated by her father and has come to her senses a bit.", "NTA but it's on the line. She uninvited you from her wedding, I can only image the heart break you must've felt. And she only came back cause choice number one left again showing that deep down you were only a replacement. It's valid to not consider her your daughter after that but with the speech you made. If you said 3 children to be petty and to spite her then YTA. If not then NTA but I recommend heavily to talk with her. She most likely is genually sorry, people are only human and we all make mistakes, sometimes it's small like breaking a vase and other times we make these life altering decisions that we cry about years later. We are dumb and always learning, your not a asshole for choosing to not make up cause what she did is messed up as hell but give up the hate man. You used to be close and you mustve enjoyed it, to have a daughter even if not your own blood is truly a wonder of this world. What's the end goal for you, to watch her suffer mentally when she is sorry all for petty satisfaction. To just not have her in your life anymore, or to move on. In my opinion go talk to her, you don't gotta accept her as a daughter but give her a chance to say sorry, everybody deserves a second chance when they mean it. You don't gotta forgive her but just giver her a chance, tell her that she can start again back at ground level zero and eventually if you both want, then you can return to that father daughter bond. At the end of the day you don't gotta listen to me but at least talk to her, think about this decision carefully cause if you do have even a little bit of love for her in your heart. No matter how small it is, you will one day be on your death bed and die regretting never making amends. I've seen that story to many times, happened with my grandfather and father. My grandpa hated my dad for a long time and they only got close again a few years before he died. His biggest regret was letting that hate stop him from being in his son's life, that he missed the majority of his grandchildrens lives, that had he let go of his resentment earlier then he would've had more years with people he loved.", "NTA- honestly, I\u2019d cut her off myself. If anyone deserved to be there and walk her down the isle it was you. She fucked around and found out- don\u2019t give the girl anything because she does not deserve it.", "NTA. Still talk to her. She fucked up for sure. But give her a chance to explain. Her dad might be super manipulative.", "NTA for not considering her your child anymore, but you are TA for drawing attention away from your wife's birthday with the \"three children\" part of your toast.\n\nYou don't have to forgive her or have her part of your life, but that extra statement during the toast was absolutely unnecessary.", "ESH Being abandoned by a biological father is a really complicated feeling, especially more confusing when they come back into your life. She acted poorly and she hurt you. You are now hurting her in reciprocation. \n\nIf you have any desire to fix this, ask her to sit down and talk with you to hash things out. Lead the conversation with the fact that you have both hurt each other and you would like to calmly lay it out on the table to see if you can salvage the relationship. This is of course dependent on if you want that. Then go from there. Maybe joint therapy if you are both open to it. Make sure you are clear that things are not fixed yet, but you want to work towards mending things.", "Nta you probably could've been the better person but she does kinda deserve this treatment since she ditched a loving kind father for a dead beat one", "NTA. uninviting you from her wedding is about as clearly \u201ci dont consider you my father\u201d as you can get. she made her bed, now she gets to lie in it.", "NTA. Every act comes with it's consequences. Sad but she broke your relationship.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Have some compassion for your step daughter, she was messed up by her bio dad abandoning her and is still young enough to be swayed by that abandonment. It was unfair for her to cut you out in favour of him, but she knows she did wrong and probably feels like she\u2019s being abandoned by another father all over again.", "YTA. I understand why you would feel this way but it\u2019s petty, do you really want to spend the rest of your life alienating a young woman you\u2019ve loved most of her life because she made a mistake? Unfortunately a lot of young people act like this when their absentee parent comes back into their lives. And she learned the same shitty lesson almost all of them do. Maybe have a conversation with her, you never know what kind of BS her father was whispering in her ear to make it feel like loving you was betraying him. Your kids don\u2019t have the lived experience to know that it\u2019s important to rise above this crap, and that it\u2019s messed up to teach someone a lesson in the middle of a birthday speech to their mother. That\u2019s not boundaries my friend, that\u2019s punishment", "INFO:\n\n> She started to disinvite me for things in favor of her bio dad and she univited me from her wedding.\n\nIs there a reason she couldn't invite both of you? Did she specifically tell you she was excluding you because of him, or did you infer that? Did she give another reason for uninviting you?", "NTA. she showed you, as an adult, meaning grown up person, how little she thinks of you. and once her bio dad is gone again, she suddenly remembers you back? nope. sometimes it's too late for being sorry.", "I have to say YTA man... You say you always treated her as your own but you apparently hadn't actually accepted her as your own, if she was one of your biological children you wouldn't have shut her out and decided she wasn't your's anymore if you actually had accepted her. \n\nShe made a bad decision, she realized it and you disowned her anyway. I'm not sure if you've ever had a parent that you felt like abandoned you but the little I know about to that is those people tend to seek the approval of the person they \"weren't good enough for\". \n\nYou aren't TA for being hurt about it but if you really want to say you loved her like she was your own you wouldn't have denounced her just like her deadbeat dad did.", "Your feelings for her are justified.  However for that toast YTA.  You should have declined to do a toast.", "NTA Apparently it is a lesson she needs to learn.", "Yta - you took a speech honoring your wife as a mother to exclude one of HER kids.

She may be an adult now but she's still your kid. Refusing to forgive her only serves to limit your relationship with her, and having a limited relationship with her is what you were upset about to begin with! To me it seems like cutting off your nose to spite your face. And especially with the speech - even if you don't consider her your kid, it was a speech for your wife and she's definitely your wife's kid.", "YTA.\n\nThe issue here is you got your feelings hurt. If you didn't care about Sam, her excluding you wouldn't have mattered and you wouldn't be holding a grudge still. But you do care, so you owe it to both yourself and to her to have an honest conversation.\n\nThe other thing is that you're not modeling forgiveness. You're teaching your daughter (which is what she is) that mistakes are irredeemable and those you hurt will never forgive you. This is not a good life lesson. Better to teach her that family is forever and a conversation, at the very least, always holds the possibility to bridge a divide, even when feelings are hurt.", "YTA For your little speech. Sam didn't stop being your wife's child and to completely erase her like that was unfair. You could have easily acknowledge Sam as your wife's child and still specifically speak on the three kids you had with her. \n\nYou're N T A for no longer wanting to maintain a dad/daughter relationship. But your still her step dad and you should remain civil out of respect for your wife and her child. Don't be so callous as to interrupt that relationship.", "YTA. It is definitely within your rights to treat her as you do and she needs the lesson. YTA to yourself because you apparently love her, consider her your child but you risk your relationship with her for that lesson.\n\nOr, I got the wrong impression. Then NTA\n\nETA: You don't only risk your relationship with Sam, you also risk her mental stability as it is possible to start blaming herself for driving away her \"deadbeat\" bio father as she drove away you.", "ESH. Boundaries aren\u2019t something other people respect. Boundaries are rules we set for ourselves.

It\u2019s hurtful and awful. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that,  but also it seems like it was out of character for her from the way he describes their relationship. My dad was a deadbeat and came around when I was an adult and really trashed my mom, eventually I ended up yelling at him that as shitty as she was she couldn\u2019t have done the things she did if he was around.

Boundaries are things like I won\u2019t take your call after such and such time, or if you are disrespectful I will walk away. It\u2019s not purposely excluding her by not calling her his child anymore or leaving her out of speeches about the family. You don\u2019t just stop loving your kid like that, and she\u2019s his kid even if it\u2019s been a rough few years, keeping going like this really hurts himself just as much at this point.

That must have been very hard to have been her dad all these years, pouring everything into that relationship and then she flips for some dead beat.

She cut you off 2 years ago and now she expects you to welcome her back with open arms now that her 'real' daddy doesn't want her again? I'm sorry but no. You have been in her life since she was 4. Meaning she most likely doesn't remember life before you. You're her dad. Plain and simple. And she didn't appreciate you. As someone who grew up with a majorly shitty dad it frustrates me beyond belief that people don't appreciate when they have GOOD parents. Family isn't about blood. It's about who has loved you and cared for you. \n\nHowever. If you would still like some kind of relationship with her (and it is YOUR choice after how she treated you)... talk to her.

I think some people on the comments are looking at things only from her perspective. \nFrom your perspective: You accepted her wholeheartedly as your child. At a crucial time in her life she cut you out coldly and rather cruelly. She then continued this behaviour for 3 YEARS! until bio dad dropped the ball again. Then all of a sudden she had this unreasonable expectation to just be your daughter again like she did not reject you as her father and treat you coldly and cruelly. \nUnfortunately the reality is that 'I am sorry' and 'but we are family' are not some magical glue that can fix all of lifes atrocities.\nI dont believe you were unnecessarily cruel or that you meant to be petty in your toast. When making your toast you simply expressed a fact which untill her father left she was in agreement with. The context of the statement is also quite relevant here. \nShe made a decision as a well informed adult about who she considered her father and you graciously yet painfully accepted that decision. You mourned this relationship, reconciled yourself to the facts and graciously moved on. \nBecause she now changed her mind doesnt mean you have to too. Your feelings arent a light switch that you can turn on and off at will. \nHowever, your wife is right. It might be time to have an open and frank conversation about this with her. Not because your step-daughtet deserves it or for purposes of closure  but to navigate the future of your now different relationship. \nSometimes in life there are no backsies.", "So your wife and kids went to her wedding even though she did invited you? That is shocking on its own", "INFO:  Where was Mom through the wedding drama?\n\nIf this happened in my family, I wouldn't have attended the wedding. She could choose between Mom or Dad.

She can stew until you are ready, if that ever comes. I would try to understand she was being manipulated, but she was allowed to behave horribly towards you.", "NTA. She is an adult. She made her choice. Now that she is facing the consequences of her choice, she is regretting it. You have no obligation to forgive her, and your relationship was over with her the second she dropped the man who raised her for her biological father. If you do sit her down to talk, it's sending a message that you forgive her or are willing to forgive her, and you need to decide now if you even want to continue a relationship with her, because you will probably never have a close father-daughter bond with her again. \n\nI also want to point out that she never had to cut you from her life.

I can\u2019t imagine what that feels like after having been dad for her whole life basically.  \n\nIf she\u2019s old enough to get married, she\u2019s old enough to have known the gravity of the decision she made and consequences of it.  She may regret it but she has a lot of nerve to call you an ass for omitting her from a toast when she did what she did.

Thrown away.", "Angela and my sons got mad at Sam but i conviced them to go to her wedding", "NTA. uninviting you from her wedding is about as clearly \u201ci dont consider you my father\u201d as you can get. she made her bed, now she gets to lie in it.", "20 years old is barely an adult", "Agreed. She probably had abandonment issues knowing her bio dad \u201crejected\u201d her. It doesn\u2019t excuse her treatment of you and it must have been terribly painful for you. But if you can find it in you to extend her some grace, it would be a great kindness and maybe you can both heal from what that man did to both of you.", "Bot.

OP, you\u2019re 100% in the right but the balls in your court now. Continuing the way you are is either going to excommunicate your step daughter from the family, or cause massive issues (headaches) later down the line. \n\nDo you think she had some feelings she never presented or dealt with of being different from you and her new siblings? Maybe when talking with her bio dad, he used his emotional leverage that he still had to try and put a wedge between the two of you?\n\nPersonal responsibility is VERY important. She should know she hurt you and the family with her actions, but if you keep her shut out forever then she either won\u2019t be outside anymore, or she\u2019ll burn the house down.", "But she does not have a clear view on that, because OP has not actually communicated with her. \n\nWhich ideally would be a her problem, sure. But the fact that he's married to her mom, who still has a relationship with her and wants her around, makes it a family problem. He doesn't have to be a dad to someone who essentially disowned him, but he should communicate what kind of relationship he is willing to have (if any) with his wife's kid.", "I'm not saying he should ignore his feelings. I'm saying he should not weaponize his hurt...which he has done.   \n\n\nThe step daughter's actions are awful, there is zero argument there. But, I would guess that loads of unprocessed trauma influenced her decision making. Again, this isn't an excuse for the behavior, just saying it is not completely and totally without influence.   \n\n\nOP should totally address his feelings, preferably with a professional, but he should not abandon his 'daughter' like the deadbeat dad did.", "Ignoring someone can be the most hurtful thing of all. His feelings are valid and should not be ignored but he was definitely and deliberately hurting her back.", "Oh, I didn't see that comment from OP. Thanks for bringing me up to date.", "I absolutely agree with you on that point. I was raised by a step dad as well. I don\u2019t think I was as lucky as this young lady though. However, she was 20 and not perfect at all. These folks are acting like they are or were perfect at 20 and haven\u2019t made any bad decisions. She messed up real bad but she should not be cast aside for a bad decision.", "No, I\u2019m an actual parent", "I've done terrible things to people I love and when they cut me out I didn't blame them, only myself. Stepdaughter should do the same.", "He's not abandoned his daughter, she made it very clear that she isn't his daughter.", "That's scary.", "Let us know when your kids go NC over your inevitable extreme overreaction to something minor.", "Ew. Doesn\u2019t make you a better guardian since you seem to have the need to hear it. Bio parents can be trash and step parents can definitely be \u201cactual parents\u201d. Fucking gross.", "Step parents are often actual parents.", "Getting uninvited from your kid's wedding is minor?", "Will do.", "It\u2019s only a matter of time."]}
