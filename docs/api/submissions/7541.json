She had a 4 year old daughter, Sam. \n\nMe and Angela had three more biological childre\u00a0 together but i always treated Sam as my own child aswell. \n\nSam's bio dad was a deadbeat. He had visitacions but never showd up, this of course affected Sam so me and Angela put her on therapy. \n\nI always had a good relationship with Sam and she always called me dad. Sam's long term boyfriend proposed to her in 2019 and in 2020 they got married and that's when things went downhill. \n\nSam's bio dad contacted her because he had heard she would get married. She started to disinvite me for things in favor of her bio dad and she univited me from her wedding. \n\nAngela and our children got mad but i asked them not to. As you might expect mine and Sam's relationship is not the same it used to be. \n\nNow almost 3 years after the wedding her dad got back into his old ways. I've been cordial but cold to her, i don't refer to her as my child anymore and she has noticed it. \n\nShe tried to talk to me but i told her i have my boundaries and she needs to respect them. \n\nYesterday, it was Angela's birthday. I made a toast to her and gave a litle speech about us and our three children. \n\nSam started crying and asked why did i needed to keep excluding her and that she had apologized and she regrets it. \n\nShe left soon after but i have not stop to think about what happened. \n\nMy children say i am not the asshole, Angela says i should at least talk to her.", "created_utc": 1673940231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e60xr/aita_for_not_considering_my_stepdaughter_my/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She even uninvited you from her wedding. She chose him over you, the father that actually took care of her when her bio dad didn't. I don't understand why people voted otherwise, she was an adult when she made the decision to cut off OP. I don't blame him in anyway to not wanting to have anything to do with her anymore. She's just an entitled brat.", "I think you should take all the time that you need to forgive her for her thoughtless actions.  I cannot believe she would uninvite you from her wedding and then wonder why you are not okay with that.  She cannot decide it's time for you to get over it.  Maybe she will find a way to truly let you know how sorry she is and then you can open up to her again. NTA.", "NTA.  I understand your position and I can imagine the pain that put you through.  You don't know if her bio-father put undue pressure on her to exclude you, it's not an excuse, but that could be a factor.\n\nNow that you got your point across, be open to reconciliation.", "ESH. She behaved poorly then. You're choosing to behave poorly now.", "NTA for being hurt and upset. A bit of YTA with the toast exclusion. I think you should consider talking to her and try to repair your relationship with someone you considered your daughter for most of her life and a significant chunk of your life. This is a fairly common issue where an absent parent shows up after years and a child starts to gravitate towards them thinking they are the best thing ever. They start to wonder if they had been misled or if the person has changed for the better. So the child starts to be influenced by the recently returned parent into doing things that are out of character. From my experience this normally only lasts for a while as the absent parent will start to fall back into bad habits and show who they are and the kid will realize this person isn\u2019t that great after all and that they hurt the people that actually cared about them and raised them.", "ESH talk to her, go to therapy together. There is a positive way out of this mess but only if you are willing to try.", "NTA. But you should try to reconcile with her. She\u2019s clearly acknowledged that she made a mistake and is trying to repair it. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to let her back in if you really don\u2019t want to, but it sounds like she was manipulated by her father and has come to her senses a bit.", "NTA but it's on the line. She uninvited you from her wedding, I can only image the heart break you must've felt. And she only came back cause choice number one left again showing that deep down you were only a replacement. It's valid to not consider her your daughter after that but with the speech you made. If you said 3 children to be petty and to spite her then YTA. If not then NTA but I recommend heavily to talk with her. She most likely is genually sorry, people are only human and we all make mistakes, sometimes it's small like breaking a vase and other times we make these life altering decisions that we cry about years later. We are dumb and always learning, your not a asshole for choosing to not make up cause what she did is messed up as hell but give up the hate man. You used to be close and you mustve enjoyed it, to have a daughter even if not your own blood is truly a wonder of this world. What's the end goal for you, to watch her suffer mentally when she is sorry all for petty satisfaction. To just not have her in your life anymore, or to move on. In my opinion go talk to her, you don't gotta accept her as a daughter but give her a chance to say sorry, everybody deserves a second chance when they mean it. You don't gotta forgive her but just giver her a chance, tell her that she can start again back at ground level zero and eventually if you both want, then you can return to that father daughter bond. At the end of the day you don't gotta listen to me but at least talk to her, think about this decision carefully cause if you do have even a little bit of love for her in your heart. No matter how small it is, you will one day be on your death bed and die regretting never making amends. I've seen that story to many times, happened with my grandfather and father. My grandpa hated my dad for a long time and they only got close again a few years before he died. His biggest regret was letting that hate stop him from being in his son's life, that he missed the majority of his grandchildrens lives, that had he let go of his resentment earlier then he would've had more years with people he loved.", "NTA- honestly, I\u2019d cut her off myself. If anyone deserved to be there and walk her down the isle it was you. She fucked around and found out- don\u2019t give the girl anything because she does not deserve it.", "NTA. Still talk to her. She fucked up for sure. But give her a chance to explain. Her dad might be super manipulative.", "NTA for not considering her your child anymore, but you are TA for drawing attention away from your wife's birthday with the \"three children\" part of your toast.\n\nYou don't have to forgive her or have her part of your life, but that extra statement during the toast was absolutely unnecessary.", "ESH Being abandoned by a biological father is a really complicated feeling, especially more confusing when they come back into your life. She acted poorly and she hurt you. You are now hurting her in reciprocation. \n\nIf you have any desire to fix this, ask her to sit down and talk with you to hash things out. Lead the conversation with the fact that you have both hurt each other and you would like to calmly lay it out on the table to see if you can salvage the relationship. This is of course dependent on if you want that. Then go from there. Maybe joint therapy if you are both open to it. Make sure you are clear that things are not fixed yet, but you want to work towards mending things.", "Nta you probably could've been the better person but she does kinda deserve this treatment since she ditched a loving kind father for a dead beat one", "NTA. uninviting you from her wedding is about as clearly \u201ci dont consider you my father\u201d as you can get. she made her bed, now she gets to lie in it.", "NTA. Every act comes with it's consequences. Sad but she broke your relationship.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Have some compassion for your step daughter, she was messed up by her bio dad abandoning her and is still young enough to be swayed by that abandonment. It was unfair for her to cut you out in favour of him, but she knows she did wrong and probably feels like she\u2019s being abandoned by another father all over again.", "YTA. I understand why you would feel this way but it\u2019s petty, do you really want to spend the rest of your life alienating a young woman you\u2019ve loved most of her life because she made a mistake? Unfortunately a lot of young people act like this when their absentee parent comes back into their lives. And she learned the same shitty lesson almost all of them do. Maybe have a conversation with her, you never know what kind of BS her father was whispering in her ear to make it feel like loving you was betraying him. Your kids don\u2019t have the lived experience to know that it\u2019s important to rise above this crap, and that it\u2019s messed up to teach someone a lesson in the middle of a birthday speech to their mother. That\u2019s not boundaries my friend, that\u2019s punishment", "INFO:\n\n> She started to disinvite me for things in favor of her bio dad and she univited me from her wedding.\n\nIs there a reason she couldn't invite both of you? Did she specifically tell you she was excluding you because of him, or did you infer that? Did she give another reason for uninviting you?", "NTA. she showed you, as an adult, meaning grown up person, how little she thinks of you. and once her bio dad is gone again, she suddenly remembers you back? nope. sometimes it's too late for being sorry.", "I have to say YTA man... You say you always treated her as your own but you apparently hadn't actually accepted her as your own, if she was one of your biological children you wouldn't have shut her out and decided she wasn't your's anymore if you actually had accepted her. \n\nShe made a bad decision, she realized it and you disowned her anyway. I'm not sure if you've ever had a parent that you felt like abandoned you but the little I know about to that is those people tend to seek the approval of the person they \"weren't good enough for\". \n\nYou aren't TA for being hurt about it but if you really want to say you loved her like she was your own you wouldn't have denounced her just like her deadbeat dad did.", "Your feelings for her are justified.  However for that toast YTA.  You should have declined to do a toast.", "NTA Apparently it is a lesson she needs to learn.", "Yta - you took a speech honoring your wife as a mother to exclude one of HER kids. Her birthday became about YOUR drama.\n\nYou either need to forgive Sam or FULLY exclude her because right now you're just ruining everything for everyone.", "ESH /her for doing that. you for putting your drama\non spot at your wife\u2019s birthday", "YTA. She may be an adult now but she's still your kid. Refusing to forgive her only serves to limit your relationship with her, and having a limited relationship with her is what you were upset about to begin with! To me it seems like cutting off your nose to spite your face. And especially with the speech - even if you don't consider her your kid, it was a speech for your wife and she's definitely your wife's kid.", "YTA, because you're being petty and unforgiving.\n\nThe issue here is you got your feelings hurt. If you didn't care about Sam, her excluding you wouldn't have mattered and you wouldn't be holding a grudge still. But you do care, so you owe it to both yourself and to her to have an honest conversation.\n\nThe other thing is that you're not modeling forgiveness. You're teaching your daughter (which is what she is) that mistakes are irredeemable and those you hurt will never forgive you. This is not a good life lesson. Better to teach her that family is forever and a conversation, at the very least, always holds the possibility to bridge a divide, even when your feelings are hurt.", "YTA For your little speech. Sam didn't stop being your wife's child and to completely erase her like that was unfair. You could have easily acknowledge Sam as your wife's child and still specifically speak on the three kids you had with her. \n\nYou're N T A for no longer wanting to maintain a dad/daughter relationship. But your still her step dad and you should remain civil out of respect for your wife and her child. Don't be so callous as to interrupt that relationship.", "YTA. It is definitely within your rights to treat her as you do and she needs the lesson. YTA to yourself because you apparently love her, consider her your child but you risk your relationship with her for that lesson.\n\nOr, I got the wrong impression. Then NTA\n\nETA: You don't only risk your relationship with Sam, you also risk her mental stability as it is possible to start blaming herself for driving away her \"deadbeat\" bio father as she drove away you.", "ESH. Boundaries aren\u2019t something other people respect. Boundaries are rules we set for ourselves. We cannot control others, but we can choose how we respond.", "YTA, for this sort of thing you'd teach her a lesson maybe. Don't speak to her for a while, or maybe even just let her know that you're disappointed and you don't see her as you once did. But disowning her completely? Man you are a huge asshole here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Youre obviously not obligated, but maybe a conversation with her and your wife would be worth it, even to just hopefully stop her randomly bursting into tears at family events.\n\nMy main question here is; if her dad was, to once again, reappear in her life because he wants to play daddy/grandpa for some big life event, would she throw you and your father/daughter relationship away again? \n\nRelationships can be rebuilt, it may never be what it was but it could be better than where it is. You need to decide what kind of relationship you really want, you clearly loved her as a daughter for decades, is that something you're ready to completely give up on? \n\nUltimately I really think individual therapy and then family therapy would be beneficial so you can work out what you want moving forward, what your boundaries will be, how to enforce them and what the consequences would be if she once again throws everything in your face.", "YTA.  The toast was on the occasion of her mother's birthday, so it should have been phrased to include all her mother's children.

It was Angela's", "Family is not black or white. People can mend things. There probably was a lot of inner turmoil going on with the stepdaughter once the bio dad turned up, they should at least try to talk it out.", "And that's not enough of a reason to disown her.\n\nShe had the opportunity to have two dads, which is more than a lot of people have, some people don't even have one.\n\nYes, bio dad showed his true colours, and at that point YOU should have stepped up and been the dad she needed, but you basically disowned her instead.\n\nIf you can't see how wrong that is, I don't know what else to tell you.\n\nAre you gonna disown your other kids when they leave for college?", "I think disinviting him from the wedding is absolutely fucked up. It\u2019s hurtful and awful. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that,  but also it seems like it was out of character for her from the way he describes their relationship. My dad was a deadbeat and came around when I was an adult and really trashed my mom, eventually I ended up yelling at him that as shitty as she was she couldn\u2019t have done the things she did if he was around. My sister still lets him mess with her head and she\u2019s 35, deadbeat parents usually like to blame the parents who stepped up for mistakes and it\u2019s usually effective for a time at least. \n\nI would say yes she needs to start the conversation only he said she has apologized multiple times, now he is alienating her. Boundaries are things like I won\u2019t take your call after such and such time, or if you are disrespectful I will walk away. It\u2019s not purposely excluding her by not calling her his child anymore or leaving her out of speeches about the family. You don\u2019t just stop loving your kid like that, and she\u2019s his kid even if it\u2019s been a rough few years, keeping going like this really hurts himself just as much at this point.
