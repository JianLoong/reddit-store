Mom paying her debt was the right move, but the payments should have been going directly to the lender.  Anything beyond the debt is just enabling unless it's your elderly parent or child. You aren't responsible for the debt at all. \n\nEverything else is white noise.  They can be Tiny Tim or rich like Scrooge.  I wouldn't change the ethical thing to do based on their income or lack of it regarding the debt payments.", "NTA. You already know the answer.", "Hell, no.", "NTA. Send out a text or email to everyone and say you will not be sending any more money. Just stop replying to all their communications.", "I never intended to be that. I was horrified when I had one of the working ones ask me what are they supposed to use to pay their bills. I thought \u201cso you mean to tell me you\u2019ve not being doing ANYTHING with the money you earned??!!\u201d Until then I thought what I sent was enough to pay the loan and then a little left over to get some extra necessities.", "Your intention was always noble OP, but it is not your responsibility to teach them how to manage their finances. They have abused your good will and you have to put an end to it.\n\nFurthermore, is most likely  that the ooan has already been paid a long time ago and no one has told you", "NTA.  They're proven liars and moochers. Don't give them another thought.", "Not enough information", "No! Just stop! Your are NOT an ATM machine. You never were. You mother mostly likely paid her debt to them twice over at minimum. Your payments made it three times over. \n\nDo not send them money ever again.  If you have extra money put it in a savings account or retirement fund for your old age. They sure as heck don't care about your well-being or your mothers.\n\nYou got sucked into this and it became a bad habit.  You broke the habit, but like  bad habits (addict) you occasionally feel the urge. Resist the urge. Your well-being depends on stopping your financial support.\n\nNot your responsibility to support lazy people even if they are family. They are lazy and liars.\n\nThey had no problem lying to you.  Implying they were working and still struggling.  They are con men and women. \n\nI strongly suspect they were conning your mom too, telling her she still owed them when she didn't or implying.  Your mother struggled for them!! They took money that  should have gone to care for you and to have a better life, but she gave to con men and con women.\n\nRemember that every time you doubt yourself or feel guilty - they stole from your mom.  They made her life harder. Those actions in turn made your harder too.\n\nCan you imagine how her retirement would be right now had she put  that money into a savings account instead of giving it to con men?\n\nWalk away,  don't look back,  never send them another penny. I suggest you go NC and block them completely. \n\nIn the event they ever do need money,  that's  their problem. They can get a job. \nThey can all move into the same home to save money.  They can reach out to other family and friends. Not you. Ever again send anything. \n\nYou should not try to find out if their need is real.  You already know they are liars and lazy. They are adults,  this is a \"them\" problem, not your problem. \n\nDo not help them again if needed. This is for them to figure out without help from you. \n\nContinue to stay strong.

Out of the surplus they did give me, without being asked, the money they took from me during the 4 months they had the windfall and didn\u2019t tell me about it. Outside of that, nothing else can be recouped. I am not evening asking for it if they really needed it. Like I said, I wanted nothing from them.

Your grandchildren?", "The original loan has been paid.
