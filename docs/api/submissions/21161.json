It should be 100% going to you.  Unless your mom could show how she was using that money to support you, this is actually fraud.", "NTA. This is fraud. You are most likely not getting as much government support as you could be getting because the government thinks you\u2019re being supported by your father.", "NTA. It's not alimony, it's child support. It's meant to support the child - in this case, you. Right now the child - you - is struggling to get the food they need to survive because the child support money isn't being spent on them.", "NTA.

Your mom is an adult and needs to support herself and not sponge off her disabled child.", "NTA!!! That child support money is called child support because it\u2019s for YOU.

There moment you moved out, the money goes with you, because she no longer pays for anything. \nI want to go with E. S. because I'm being you haven't been honest with your dad. Does Dad know he is being forced to give your support to your mom?  That is child support fraud committed by both you and your mom. I am sorry to be so blunt, but you are really doing a disservice to your father AND yourself.  Would you want to be fooled like that?", "NTA, Talk with your father and see if you can get the court order changed. If you are no longer living with your mother the support money should be going to you. Child support is supposed to be used to ensure the child has a roof over their head, electricity, water, food, and clothing. While it never completely covers all of those things that\u2019s what it is for. If your mother is unable to cover her bills without the child support, then she needs to downsize and find a place she can afford. It\u2019s unfair to you and your father for her to continue to accept that money end it may be illegal.", "Report her if she doesn\u2019t give it to you", "Unless he was a deadbeat dead and this was money to reimburse the mother for having to support the child on her own.", "NTA if you\u2019re living on your own and she\u2019s not supporting you, then that money should be used to support YOU not her. Good luck", "NTA but be careful that Ontario won\u2019t deduct from your ODSP an equivalent of what you would receive from the child support money. Based on my experience with my father having been on Ontario disability.", "NTA This is a reportable offense.", "INFO: is your mom currently paying any of your bills?", "Child support is to support you, while you are a dependent.\n\nIf you're living independently and on government support, your father should not be paying any mandated support to you or your mother any more. Your mother should not be keeping the money (unless this is reimbursement of owed back dated support) but you don't actually get it either. Not as child support. If your father *wants* to give you support directly as an allowance, of course he may.

Go back to court and have those payments directed to you.", "NTA\n\nContact your Dad and ask to have the support sent to you.", "Before you consult a lawyer, which costs lots of money, you should discuss this with your mother and father. Seems like the support should go directly to you now that you're an adult. If your disability is lifelong, maybe your dad will just support you out of the goodness of his heart, without the court's involvement.", "This is good advice!  Most Canadian provinces consider support payments \"earned income\" and claw the $$ back (I'm in BC).

The current money is for your current support. If your mother isn't currently supporting you, that money should be legally going directly to you. If not, your mother is committing fraud. And she can get in very deep legal troubles for doing so. \n\nShe could be ordered to pay restitution and have to repay the money, face jail time, fines. Lawyer fees. Etc.\n\nThat money is for you to live. You are not receiving that money to help you live. Your mother's living situation does not matter in this. It doesn't matter if she struggles, or not. That is her situation to deal with.\n\nYou are NTA for her having to be accountable for her own living situation.\n\nIt doesn't even matter if you are struggling (which it sounds like you are.) Or not. The money is being paid by your father through order from the court for one specific reason. It is support money for you, to be used only as such. If she refuses to allow that, you will need to learn how to have the payments directed to you with the legal routes your government has for that to happen.", "First-- have you asked your mom what she'd doing with the money and why she's not giving it to you?  If she won't answer then you should contact your case worker and explain that you are not living with your mom but your court ordered support from your father is still be spent by your mom on things that are not for your living expenses or care.", "NTA. Your mom and dad are not together she\u2019s not entitled to his money.
