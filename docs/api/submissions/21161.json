It's not for the parent.", "NTA - the child support payment isn't to support your mom, it's to support you.  If your dad knew it wasn't going to you he could sue your mom.  It should be 100% going to you.  Unless your mom could show how she was using that money to support you, this is actually fraud.", "NTA. This is fraud. You are most likely not getting as much government support as you could be getting because the government thinks you\u2019re being supported by your father.", "NTA. It's not alimony, it's child support. It's meant to support the child - in this case, you. Right now the child - you - is struggling to get the food they need to survive because the child support money isn't being spent on them.", "NTA. Make sure the child support money won\u2019t reduce your disability benefits. After you figure out it does or doesn\u2019t affect them, please call your dad. Your mom is an adult and needs to support herself and not sponge off her disabled child.", "NTA!!! That child support money is called child support because it\u2019s for YOU.

Please talk to your dad about this if he doesn\u2019t already know what she\u2019s doing with the money, and if necessary, you should look into legal action.", "Nta.

Does Dad know he is being forced to give your support to your mom?  That is child support fraud committed by both you and your mom.

Would you want to be fooled like that?", "NTA, Talk with your father and see if you can get the court order changed. If you are no longer living with your mother the support money should be going to you. Child support is supposed to be used to ensure the child has a roof over their head, electricity, water, food, and clothing. While it never completely covers all of those things that\u2019s what it is for. If your mother is unable to cover her bills without the child support, then she needs to downsize and find a place she can afford. It\u2019s unfair to you and your father for her to continue to accept that money end it may be illegal.", "Report her if she doesn\u2019t give it to you", "Unless he was a deadbeat dead and this was money to reimburse the mother for having to support the child on her own."]}
