The amount of times the same physical dollar is taxed is outrageous \n\n\nWe dumped a whole ship of tea in the harbor for less than this \ud83d\ude21", "I am here for this petty.", "$!0 wine? Nah. Got to Aldi's and get one of their $1.99 specials. Granted, it stretches the meaning of wine, but the label still uses the word. Then wrap the $200 invoice.... wait! Make it a late notice for non-payment and state the next step is referral to a collection company!", "There's many types of student loan debt forgiveness that have no bearing on federal taxes.", "Oh, okay. I\u2019ll get you a gift when you repay me the $200 you owe me. That\u2019s my gift spending money. \nOkay, mom. Can I borrow $200 from you to get sister a gift? \nNTA", "NTA. Why invest even more money into someone who doesn't respect your effort at helping them by even trying to pay at least a little bit of the debt? I mean if she could buy Christmas presents then at least she could have afforded a $50 dollar  (or less) partial payment to you along the way.  But instead of spending even more on her, you gave her a way to not worry about the debt. No doubt she's disappointed by not having a traditional gift to open, but that also tells you her priorities.  I would not provide her any further loans.", "NTA.  A $200 gift is way too much for her,  she doesn\u00b4t deserve so much. You should have announced that the $200 will be your christmas gift for her for the next 4 years ($50 per christmas)", "Nta. I have done this to my adult children. (But I wasn\u2019t being a jerk i was trying to help because they were making payments on the debt and i felt like i was taking the food outta my grandkids mouth.). My son and Dil appreciated the gift.", "Op, how expensive was the present she got you? Bet it was not $200! \n\nThe only reason she didn't like you gift is because she had no intentions of paying you back!\n\nNta!!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour actual gift is that you will stop nagging her.", "NTA, but JUST barely, almost mild E-S-H, for telling her verbally instead of writing it in a nice card (that you'd ideally put at least a bit of though into choosing one that either fits her interests/personality/aesthetic preference, or has a picture on it that thoightfully relates to the reason why she originally borrowed money from you)", "NTA.  Your sister and your mother need their heads examined.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ll buy her a gift when you get your money back lol", "NTA. Maybe you should have printed off a certificate, complete with Christmas motifs, stating the $200 debt was paid in full, stuck it in a wrapped box and put a bow on it. That's the only thing I can think of that might have made both her and your mother happy. Good grief! You want to know what I gave my family for their birthdays some years? Another year on my cell phone plan (that I pay for). Did any of them complain that it wasn't a real gift? No. Why? Because it was a real gift!", "Nta she used the money she owes you for other gifts", "NTA.  Sounds like the perfect gift to me. IJS.", "NTA. I think it is a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA. But don\u2019t loan her anything again. Only gifts! Your mom is concerned that you will ruin your relationship with your sister over $200. You may want to point out that sister is actually the one responsible for that. But are you worried about that? Do you anticipate ever needing a loan from her? Easier just not to burn that bridge than have to rebuild it.", "NTA. But you could have put it in a card or something to make it a little less passive aggressive.", "I feel like you kinda deserve to be embarrassed if someone has to chase for months on end and each time you promise to pay them back soon but dont", "> you are basically saying you have zero confidence that she will ever take care of it\n\nI mean if it has been months and OP has asked several times, to which she promised to pay but doesnt...", "Wrap the gift first, and tell her you will exchange her christmas gift for her 200$ debt", "You nailed it. Her behavior demonstrates she never planned to pay back the loan.", "Depending on your location the tattoo might have been prepaid already quite some time ago and often enough isn't refundable. If she paid for it before the car accident and then got into financial trouble the money isn't magically going to come back. But that's assuming a lot about the situation.
