Her reaction tells me it's the latter, personally. I would be *flooded* with relief if someone just forgave a debt of over a hundred dollars. Just simple and flat out like that. The weight of that off my shoulders would be enough of a gift.\n\nHer being insulted says, to me, that she just wants *more*.

What exactly is yourt sister's situation/problem?\n\nTo illustrate: I have two friends, both of whom I've lent about that amount to in the past.

She really means to pay me back, she actually does start saving up, but then she'll do something stupid like buy the umptillionth cute-looking decorative dust catcher she doesn't even have room for anymore, or get me some silly cheerful holiday sweater because I'd look so great in that. She might actually get there, but it'll take another year or two unless I manage to come up with new ideas to keep her from being stupid.\n\nAss is a freeloader who probably owes various people a four-digit total by now and couldn't care less.
