You gave her a 200 dollar gift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have a loan that's forgiven, that's considered taxable income by the IRS.  It's a net gain.  Considering money is fungible, it's no different than you giving her a stack of 10 20 dollar bills.", "NTA. If she ever actually had any intention of paying you back, I would think that she would find it to be a great Christmas gift.", "NTA.\n\nOf course she would rather have a nice gift and still \"owe\" you the money forever.\n\nShe's been insulting your intelligence for about a year, telling you she was going to pay you back \"soon.\"  She may have been embarrassed by the gift, but she *deserved* to be embarrassed.\n\nFor future:  Never loan money to a friend or relative that you NEED back, or that you can't consider a gift.", "NTA. You were never going to get it back anyway.\n\nBesides, you gave her a $200 gift, she should be happy!", "Ahahaha, I love it! Good for you. She was never going to pay you back, and if she was planning to, she would have actually appreciated your gift. Next time write it on a lovely card so they can\u2019t say you put no thought into it. NTA", "NTA: Guess who's not gonna loan her money anymore..", "NTA\n\nIt was a $200 gift. Depending on how presents are opened, it could have been embarrassing...but she owed the money and now she doesn't.\n\nLending money to friends or family is trickier than it should be.", "NTA. She sounds very entitled", "NTA\n\nThis is equal to a two hundred dollar gift. It's like rewinding and handing her the 200 she took when she needed it and saying don't worry about it. If you'd called it a Christmas gift at the time, she'd have probably agreed. \n\nWhen it's been so long and she still hasn't been able to pay it back, either she literally cannot manage it in her budget, or she just doesn't consider the debt important. Her reaction tells me it's the latter, personally. I would be *flooded* with relief if someone just forgave a debt of over a hundred dollars. Just simple and flat out like that. The weight of that off my shoulders would be enough of a gift.\n\nHer being insulted says, to me, that she just wants *more*. She isn't seeing the value of the money you gave her, she wants to know that you're paying attention to her, to her tastes, to what she wants.\n\nThis is all just my perception, of course. This is just how I would perceive and react to this situation.\n\nIf you want advice, I would shrug it off and leave it be. Her gift this year was 200 dollars. She can deny that if she wants, but it is what it is quite literally. If anything about this situation should be embarrassing your mom, it's how your sister \"borrowed\" 200 dollars and refused to pay it back. (Assuming your sister could afford to repay the debt.)", "NTA.  If you've been asking for a year, every month or so that means that she has had at least 6 opportunities to pay you back and has made the decision not to.  I think you provided a good solution to this problem that will likely prevent her from repeating her mistake.  However, both your mother and sister are wrong that this is NOT a gift.  It most definitely is.  It's a gift worth $200.00 which, I would bet, is more than you would have spent anyway.", "NTA  This is actually a huge gift.  Don't lend her money EVER again.", "NTA. Perfectly acceptable solution", "NTA\n\nWhat'd they think the $200 was, monopoly money? \"Oh sorry, I was going to use the money I lent you to buy your gift but I thought you would have one less thing to worry about if I just forgave the debt as your gift.\" \n\nTo be petty, you could have wrapped up hand drawn IOU for her to unwrap. Done and dusted.  That demonstrates that you thought about it and made sure to still give her something to unwrap.", "NTA but go buy her a $50 gift card as a gift and tell her she owes you the $200 next week or start charging interest.", "NTA. That amount for a gift is more than enough - your sister sounds like a brat.", "NTA.  Give her a candle and hand lotion and she still owes you money.  I do have a present for you, but you need to pay me back first.", "NTA\n\nShe was upset because you were right.  She wasn't going to pay you back.  She's wrong, your mom is wrong.  Don'[t.ever.loan.her.money](https://t.ever.loan.her.money).again.  Problem solved.", "Info: more of it. What exactly is yourt sister's situation/problem?\n\nTo illustrate: I have two friends, both of whom I've lent about that amount to in the past. Let's call them Dumb and Ass.\n\nDumb is just completely incapable of managing her finances. She really means to pay me back, she actually does start saving up, but then she'll do something stupid like buy the umptillionth cute-looking decorative dust catcher she doesn't even have room for anymore, or get me some silly cheerful holiday sweater because I'd look so great in that. She might actually get there, but it'll take another year or two unless I manage to come up with new ideas to keep her from being stupid.\n\nAss is a freeloader who probably owes various people a four-digit total by now and couldn't care less. He's Ass, after all. Okay, admittedly, I don't exactly think of him as much of a friend anymore, but bear with me.\n\nIs your sister Dumb? Then mild YTA, because that probably really did feel embarassing, and it certainly did nothing to help her get a better handle on how to manage her finances. Which is the help she needs, not alms.\n\nIs your sister Ass? NTA. Obviously.\n\nIs your sister somewhere in between on the Dumb-Ass-spectrum? I ain't got enough info to make a call.", "NTA and good for you :)\n\nAs a general rule never lend money to close friends and family unless you are prepared to the fact that they will never pay you back. Just consider the money lost or, if you insist in getting it back, prepare to put a dent in the relationship. Better to come up with an excuse to refuse the loan.", "NTA. It is a gift. You officially gifted her the money and won;t be angry bc she\u2019s not paying you back", "NTA. Someone once did that for me and I loved it.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been more than patient.", "Hahaha, i think it is a very generous gift. Not sure why she is upset about it. And how does it embarrass your mother exactly? NTA", "NTA - she got $200 cash as a gift, it just happened to be given months before Christmas. If she was gonna pay you back, she would have at least started making payments.", "NTA. Your sister is, among other things, ungrateful. I'd never lend her money again, and it would be a long time before I even thought about getting her a gift.", "Come on, this is a very insulting move.\n\nWhile I admire the ingenuity.

Sure. Personally, I'd be ecstatic to have debt forgiven (and I don't even owe any loved ones money)\n\nAlso, I've been desperate. I get it. But if it takes you over a year to pay back $200, you have no business borrowing money", "If you did this in public or in front of others, then that was an asshole move.

Has she been putting it off because she actually doesn't have the money or because she thought she could get away with it? \n\nEither way I don't really think you're the asshole, but if she actually was saving up or planning to pay you back and hasn't been able to, I could see how this would make her feel like shit. Might have been better to get her an inexpensive card or small gift that shows you thought about her and also saying in the spirit of the holiday you'd like to forgive her debt. If she has the money and just didn't want to pay you back before then she's just mad that she didn't get away with it.", ">if she actually was saving up \n\nThere's no rule that says she can't repay the debt $10 or $20 at a time."]}
