I agree it is petty but as I have asked multiple times over 9 years I finally snapped due to the truck pushing the pile into my yard not just on the edge of our yards.", "Lmao, that's because their assistant does the work of writing the actual letter. All they have to do is approve and sign it.", "Curious, did his having is pushed by a truck in to your yard damage the grass and such in any way? Even just tire marks or scraping the ground could be something you can use against him. Take pics if so and try to have a camera pointed where he does this to get proof.\n\nIf he did it he is not only on your property but causing it probs you will have to fix, which he obviously won't pay for.", "Yes there was scrapping of they yard in a couple of places.  I have taken pictures for future reference.", "Would add that excess snow piles may contribute to flooding of your property as they melt."]}
