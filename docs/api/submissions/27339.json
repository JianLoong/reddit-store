So I can understand that urge to not respond.\n\nSure, she may well have had a genuine reason for all the changes of plan that outweighed her ability to be considerate. If you were able to accommodate that last minute, that would've been going above and beyond. But not being able to accommodate is a neutral thing imo, rather than making you an AH.", "NTA.

You can't go back and forth like this.   30 minutes is not enough notice even if she asked and rescinded earlier because once she rescinded it reset the ask to a new one", "NTA.  She cannot put her indecision on you.  If she wanted you to even consider taking the shift, she should have told you well ahead in advance. And if she wasn\u2019t sure, it might have even been better to tell you to go ahead and take the shift, just to be safe. She did not do any of that, and you even stayed up late waiting to hear from her, so I think you already did more than you had to.  It was unreasonable for her to think 30 minutes was enough notice so so not worry about it.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction was spot on.

OP is quite right to ignore the last-minute text, particularly so as the co-worker couldn't be assed to provide a clear answer (or even a request for additional delay to the final answer) by 10PM as they'd said they would do.

It\u2019s not like she has maliciously planned ahead to get you in trouble (at least it doesn\u2019t sound like it), but more she doesn\u2019t want to be blamed for her own flakiness, so she\u2019s making out that she asked you to cover and then you didn\u2019t and how is that her fault?! \u2026. So keep those text messages, and then if it gets turned on you just shrug and say \u201cNah, she asked and cancelled and then didn\u2019t ask again\u2026 until 30mins before her shift started.
