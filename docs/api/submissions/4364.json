That's just being a rude friggin' house guest.  If someone brought their dog over to my home and it peed or pooped on my floor, I'd have some words with them for sure.

She is reactive, we are training and I let people know when they come over how to introduce themselves to ease my dog. Basically her behavioral concerns are being managed or addressed so she can live her happiest life.\n\nYour sister is doing the opposite. She is putting her dog in situations where they are above threshold and telling herself she is somehow meeting the dogs emotional needs or trying to meet the emotional needs (?), the mental gymnastics is amazing on this one.

As for house training, SIL needs to be more in tune with her dog's cues so she notices when the poor pup needs to go potty & correct the behavior in the moment.
