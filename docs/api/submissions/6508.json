He was on the floor looking like he was gonna pass out.\n\nI looked worried saying this was really serious and that I\u2019d go get help.

I was like why not, dude you are literally passing out.\n\nHe started explaining to me what happened b but had trouble breathing, saying he was up at 4 AM couldn\u2019t sleep and drank a shit ton of alcohol. He said it felt good so he kept drinking more and more and he said his parents will kill him if they find out.\n\nI said this is serious and a lecture from his parents is better than him potentially dying.

I\u2019m scared of throw up so I backed up a whole lot. \n\nI told him I\u2019m sorry and that if he\u2019s mad at me so be it. He tried to run after me, but then he collapsed. He said he\u2019ll run away so they can\u2019t catch him or something. I said fine, I wouldn\u2019t report him. When he started up, I sneaked away, and started telling people nearby to get the nurse, and that my friend was drunk. We are allowed to eat or hang out outside around the school entrance. I told them I can\u2019t because he said if I go away he\u2019ll try and leave.\n\nI told them not to ask questions and go. I came back and and my friend who was on the ground accused me of telling, I continually denied I did.\n\nI had to stall him, and I really hoped some of the people I told would get the nurse. They did, the nurse called the ambulance and I went. My friend kept yelling at me \"fuck you, fuck you bitch, die in a hole.\" At the time it seemed like I did what I had to do.\n\nBut regardless I still did betray him and go against his wishes.

It should be noted that if the kid did have alcohol poisoning OP probably would have mentioned it in  the post, just saying.\n\n\nEdit: Why is it so hard for people to stay civil in this thread?", "Nobody said he had alcohol poisoning, and all of these are none of my problem, kid wants to get drunk let him get drunk. Noone said he was dying, everyone is jumping to conclusions. I stand my opinion and that is all this page is, opinions.  You don't sell out your friends and then try to figure out why noone wants to hang out with you.", "It was not \u2018snitching\u2019 it was looking out for a friend who made a dangerous choice.\n\nI know that kids do their own thing but it is not ok for them to drink alcohol. It is NOT ACCEPTABLE for a 14 year old to watch a drunk 17 year old. If you continue to think that it acceptable then everyone else will fight you for being an idiot.", "Jesus Christ. I genuinely cannot understand any of these people trying to normalize a fucking 17 yr old being extremely drunk at 1030 in the morning. This is not healthy. It is not normal teenage experimentation. The kid needs help the the friend did the right thing. Alcohol poisoning isn\u2019t only when you\u2019re literally dying. Vomiting is already a sign of alcoholic poisoning. Just because drunk culture normalizes it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not extremely unhealthy.", "It seems like you think you\u2019re a better friend for not \u201cselling him out,\u201d but in the same breath say \u201cit\u2019s not my problem, if he wants to get drunk, let him get drunk.\u201d You\u2019re essentially saying \u201cwho cares?\u201d\n\n*A friend cares.*\n\n*A friend* cares if their friend gets so drunk they\u2019re puking their guts out and having trouble breathing. \n\n*A friend* cares about their friend so much that they aren\u2019t thinking, \u201coh gee, if I possibly get my friend life-saving medical attention, bullies might be mean to me :(\u201c no, they\u2019re thinking \u201cI need to get my friend help or he might die, even if he hates me for it and others don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not jumping to conclusions, it\u2019s using the facts presented to come to a reasonable conclusion. Heavy underage drinking that leads to breathing problems, trouble walking/standing, vomiting, severe inebriation issues hours after consumption, leads to the *reasonable conclusion* of alcohol poisoning. It\u2019s willfully ignorant to think otherwise, and it\u2019s callous to let your friend suffer in that condition because of some out-dated and self-preservatory idea of \u201csnitching.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be a good friend, fine. But OP was a great friend.", ">Nobody said he had alcohol poisoning\n\nExpect the described symptoms indicate alcohol poisoning.", "Not normalizing, just knowing from my past and that people don't change, they're going to so it because everyone tells them not to. How else is someone going to learn how to respect it if you don't get sick your first time drinking?", "My friends aren't that stupid", "What are you even talking about? This isn\u2019t about him telling his friend not to do it. Obviously he already did it. But the 14 yr old has no obligation to hide an extremely unhealthy thing and take care of his bad decisions simply to not \u201csnitch\u201d on his friend. The friend could have died. He did the right thing.", "Good, now try reading what I wrote.", "NTA. Alcohol poisoning is serious and it sounds like he was suffering from it.  You did the right thing, whether or not he gets past that, you made it so he got medical help.", "NTA...there are young people who have died from alcohol poisoning because kids don't want to get in trouble and would rather ignore someone dying in front of them then get yelled at by an authority figure.", "NTA - This was necessary and will help him more in the end than not telling someone. Don\u2019t question yourself.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone drinks enough that they are losing consciousness they could have alcohol poisoning and people can and do die from that. You did the right thing by getting him help. He made the choice to go to school drunk and if you hadn\u2019t noticed someone else would\u2019ve and I\u2019m honestly surprised none of the teachers noticed before you did. Don\u2019t feel bad. You made the right choice.", "NTA\n\nIt was a medical emergency. Your friend had alcohol poisoning and could have potentially died if you had not intervened. You did the right thing by telling people and getting help.", "NTA. You may have saved his life. Getting help was a VERY good call!", "NTA a guy in my school died of alcohol poisoning before even making it to high school. Your friend made poor choices. He will have consequences. You made the right choice to look out for his safety. Hopefully he understands that someday.", "NTA. \n\nIt might cost you the friendship (and some rep, depending on the culture in your school), but your inaction could have cost his life.", ">He won\u2019t die because of alcohol\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-poisoning/", "> being drunk doesn't kill you.\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-poisoning/", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
