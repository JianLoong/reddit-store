(Imagine I had said that when she sat down with her lasanga first thing.) I got angry and indicated to her plate and said \"well, just look at what's on your plate!\" Everyone close to us heard both remarks, both her mean remark to me and mine back, but they only looked shocked at my reply. I'm sick and tired of the double standard, that everyone can say mean things to me about my food but I just have to take it.
