His son isn\u2019t owed an Xbox just because your son has one he no longer wants and Jason can\u2019t afford it. Your brother has no business telling you how to parent. It sounds like your son has a job and understands buying things with his own money. Your brother is an opportunist. \n\nPlus, if you force Owen to gift it to his cousin, that is telling him his possessions are up for grabs and aren\u2019t really his. It\u2019s disrespectful to your son because it was a gift. If he wants to gift it that\u2019s great, but if he doesn\u2019t then forcing him will make him resent you, his cousin, and his uncle.
