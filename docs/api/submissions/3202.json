His son isn\u2019t owed an Xbox just because your son has one he no longer wants and Jason can\u2019t afford it. Your brother has no business telling you how to parent. It sounds like your son has a job and understands buying things with his own money. Your brother is an opportunist. \n\nPlus, if you force Owen to gift it to his cousin, that is telling him his possessions are up for grabs and aren\u2019t really his. It\u2019s disrespectful to your son because it was a gift. If he wants to gift it that\u2019s great, but if he doesn\u2019t then forcing him will make him resent you, his cousin, and his uncle.

He's selfish.", "NTA, uf they arent doing well.financially, tell them it wouldnt be good for them to have an increase on their electric bill", "NTA.\n\nI'd say 'demanding a free video game console' is, in fact, \"being selfish and having a teenage attitude.\"", "NTA you gifted that to your son so it\u2019s his and your brothers comment is invalid. \nYour kid is either going to make a loss if he gives it away, and even if he trades in to buy a switch since he\u2019ll likely have to pay the difference. \nSurprised your brother didn\u2019t even offer to buy it at a reduced price or anything if he wants one so bad", "NTA\n\nYour brother is not entitled to financial support from your son. Because, that is what your brother is asking for here. His end game is his kid gets something for free and your son ends up with nothing. Tell your son to sell his system and use the money to buy what he wants.", "This! Why would anyone expect a 16 year old to give something that expensive and without having something in return? A 16 year old has to work so hard to get the money for the switch. Jason can buy the xbox from Owen to give to his son.

OP should tell the brother that life is about giving not receiving. So, giving his son a free Xbox is not a good life lesson.", ">NTA, but if they're hard up for cash and you think it would be an appreciated gift, you could buy it off your son and gift it to them?\n\nNO! NO fucking way should a choosy pushy, unreasonable beggar, with no shame, be rewarded for their shameless behaviour!\n\nHe has absolutely no right to demand a present for his kid and that should be be entertained or indulged. You give him what he wants, you are rewarding this sort of behaviour and that just no.", "Brother can do this thing called saving up", " did you not read the post?
