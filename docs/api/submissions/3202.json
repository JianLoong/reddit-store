Jason said that I should make Owen gift it to his cousin instead.\n\nI argued that it's Owen's xbox and he can do what he wants with it. Jason told me that me and my husband bought the xbox so that's not an excuse, and that I'm just trying to avoid doing the right thing. He accused me of being selfish and \"having a teenage attitude\" and said that I should make Owen give away his xbox. He went off about how i need to teach my son that life is about giving not just receiving and that I'd set a bad example I I didn't.\n\nI know I'm within my rights to just tell Jason to forget about it or piss off but I want to know if that would make me an asshole.\n\nI havent talked about it to Owen yet because I dont want him to feel pressured to feel a certain way about it.", "created_utc": 1669380880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4cpj3/wibta_if_i_didnt_make_my_son_give_away_his_xbox/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, Owen can gift his cousin XBox if his uncle wants to gift Owen a Nintendo Switch. After all, doesn't he want to be a good uncle to his nephew?", "NTA. You gave it to Owen. It\u2019s his. He wants to get a Nintendo switch and is willing to pay any difference. That\u2019s responsible. He\u2019s not asking you or your husband to pay for it. Your brother is entitled. His son isn\u2019t owed an Xbox just because your son has one he no longer wants and Jason can\u2019t afford it. Your brother has no business telling you how to parent. It sounds like your son has a job and understands buying things with his own money. Your brother is an opportunist. \n\nPlus, if you force Owen to gift it to his cousin, that is telling him his possessions are up for grabs and aren\u2019t really his. It\u2019s disrespectful to your son because it was a gift. If he wants to gift it that\u2019s great, but if he doesn\u2019t then forcing him will make him resent you, his cousin, and his uncle. He has a right to do what he wants with his belongings.\n\nDo not give in to your brother\u2019s demand. He\u2019s being manipulative. If he can\u2019t afford to get his son an Xbox that is not your problem. His son doesn\u2019t need one.", "NTA.\n\nThe xBox was a gift to YOUR son, and he isn\u2019t obligated to give it up for someone else, and neither are you.", "Super duper NTA. So the \"right thing\" and the \"good example\" involves your son gifting his Xbox to his cousin because your brother doesn't want to pay what it's worth?\n\nThe Xbox belongs to him, and he's under no obligation to give it away for free.\n\nThe \"right thing\" does not involve what is easiest and the most opportunistic for your brother and nephew. The \"right thing\" is what is right for everyone concerned, including your son and his desire to upgrade to a Switch.", "NTA. Your brother is just looking for a handout, at the expense of your son.\n\nIf Jason is able, tell him to pay Owen for the used Xbox. You can look up how much they sell for at GameStop. That way, Alex still gets one,  but Owen still gets the money he needs.\n\nOtherwise, Jason can f off.", "NTA. Your brother is though for thinking family should gift things just cause yall are family.", "NTA.\n\nIf he gifts the Xbox he doesn\u2019t have a switch OR an Xbox.\n\nIf he sells the Xbox he gets a switch.\n\nIf he keeps the Xbox it\u2019s status quo.\n\nYour brother is trying to get free kudos from his son at your son\u2019s expense.", "NTA. If it belongs to your son, he should be able to do what he wants with it. You would be the AH if you let your brother pressure you into taking it for free to gift it to his son. If he wants it for his son, he should have to pay your son for it. Find out what your son could sell it for and tell your brother he can have it for that price. It\u2019ll still be way less expensive than buying a new one.", "NTA You gifted it to your son, that makes it HIS. Ask your brother if he's willing to give away gifts that he's been given because the giver asked him to. YEARS after giving the gift. Your brother is the one with the teenager attitude. They're in a tough spot financially, and that's not their child's fault, but it's not your son's responsibility either.", "NTA. Your son has a job that he's going to use to pay the difference and buy games. That's not him being given anything. Your brother is the one who thinks his son should receive a free gift. I'd tell your brother he's welcome to have his son get a job and buy his own gaming system if he wants him to learn responsiblity and that he shouldn't expect to be handed everything.", "NTA\n\nIf you did make your son give away his xbox you would be an asshole.", "NTA. And it will only serve to strain your relationship with your son. Your brother is the one acting like a teenager and is extremely entitled. Maybe he and his son need to learn we don't all get what we want and very rarely do we get things for free.", "NTA.

If you haven\u2019t noticed, he\u2019s trying to guilt you into making your son give away his Xbox - is this kind of thing you want to teach your son? Bullying people into giving away their things? Stand your ground.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to teach your son to give, especially to those less fortunate.

If you tell your son he has to give it away he'll probably decide just to keep it because without selling it he won't be able to afford a Switch.", "NTA, Why does your brother feel that your son should gift his possessions to anyone?? WTF? Is he on drugs? There's no logic to this at ALL. He just suddenly demands his son be gifted certain items that belong to your son? Who does that? It doesn't matter if your son plans to keep that xbox or not, your brother is way out of line demanding anyone's belongings be gifted to his son simply because HE is broke.

Nobody gets to force others into giving up their own stuff and it actually defeats the lesson your brother pretends your son has to learn here.\n\nEither your brother buys it from your son, or you buy it from your son to gift it, or maybe you make a deal with your son that you\u2019d be the Switch if he gives the XBox. These are the only acceptable ways that your nephew is gifted it for Christmas. And you\u2019re not even forced to go this way. If your son decides to keep it or prefer selling it to someone else, it\u2019s his choice.\n\nI guess your brother isn\u2019t a bad person either, he probably saw an opportunity that would not come back to get his son something great despise their income and cling onto it any way he can.

When the Xbox 360 first released my stepdad\u2019s grandfather had just passed away and had left a lot of money to my step dad. My siblings were each treated to \u00a31000 plus a brand new Xbox for the boys the girls got other stuff. I was the only one made to pay for the console from the money I received. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind as I just appreciated having a little extra money in my pocket afterwards and hadn\u2019t counted on getting anything as he wasn\u2019t my grandfather. Fast forward 6 months and my older sister starts up saying how it\u2019s unfair she didn\u2019t get a console etc etc. I come home from work and mine has been taken. Gifted from my mother to my sister. This did piss me off as had I at least been warned I could have copied save data but instead I lost the console as well as any progress I\u2019d been making on some lengthy games. This happened a lot over the years to where I\u2019ll now lock things away when they come over and they aren\u2019t allowed in certain rooms alone. \n\nDon\u2019t cave to your brother he\u2019s the asshole for asking but you\u2019ve done well shutting him down.", "NTA.

If his uncle really wanted his son to have the Xbox, he\u2019d gift your son a switch so that could be allowed to happen, or just buy his son the Xbox. Just seems like your adult brother is trying to be cheap and avoid buying anything nice, for his kid or yours.", "YTA, your son will never forget. My mam gave my SEGA to my cousin when I was 6 and I still hold it against her 22 years later. Even if you and your partner technically bought the Xbox, you still bought it for your son and it's not right to make him give it away.\n\nYour brother is the asshole in this situation.\n\nPS, try to convince your son to just save for the Switch instead of selling his Xbox to help pay for it. He won't get much money for selling the Xbox and it still has its uses.
