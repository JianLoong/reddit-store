{"id": 9018, "submission_id": "10si6hg", "title": "AITA for assuming I should get paid for my time when a friend asked for help?", "selftext": "A few months ago I picked up a few shifts in a local bar. It was just a casual, as and when thing for a bit of extra cash. The owner of the bar ended up leaving to pursue another career and a very good friend of mine took over the bar. He said to me that he would no longer be able to give me any work as they would not be able to make ends meet by paying staff, so he and his family were going to run the place themselves. This was completely fine by me as the job was only ever going to be a temporary fix and I had since found a day job elsewhere anyway. I said to him that if he was ever stuck in the future I would be more than happy to help out. He thanked me and that was that. I started going in just as a regular customer and loved that one of my oldest friends was running my local bar. \n\nAnyway, skip to last week and the friend asks me if I could come and cover the bar for a few hours as he and his family had to attend a family emergency out of town, which of course I did. It was a busy Saturday night and I was completely on my own with no help but I didn\u2019t mind as I was just concerned about my friends situation and wanted to help. A few hours turned into the entire evening and I ended up being there around 7 hours with no break and didn\u2019t leave until about 2am.\n\nNow here\u2019s the dilemma. This was never discussed prior to me starting the shift but I assumed the friend would pay me for my time. I didn\u2019t ask for the money when I left that evening as I could tell everyone was upset and exhausted when they returned so I figured I would just go over later in the week to collect it. A few days went by and there was no mention of pay from my friend so yesterday I decided to text him to gently remind him. He replied saying that he assumed I was helping out as a favour to a friend and that he hadn\u2019t planned on paying me, saying that he had already explained to me that he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to pay extra staff.\n\nI feel that out of principal I should insist on some form of payment (it was only ever a cash in hand job and I don\u2019t/didn\u2019t have a contract) but I also don\u2019t want to make it awkward between us and potentially fall out. So I\u2019m stuck debating whether I should ask for the money or drop it and accept that I did the work as a favour.\n\nSo AITA for expecting payment in this situation?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not in the US and tipping isn\u2019t really a thing here so I didn\u2019t receive any money in tips.\n\nEdit 2: I just wanted to make the point that yes, he could have closed up for the evening if he didn\u2019t want to pay someone but the bar is something of a community hub in quite a remote area and is a lifeline for many in our community so the decision to stay open and call me in was probably more informed by that reason rather than staying open purely to make money. \n\nI\u2019m not going to pursue it any further with him. I\u2019d rather stay friends and chalk it down to experience. I love him dearly and he\u2019s not a bad person. I just needed to know outsider\u2019s opinions for my own peace of mind but I think I can rest easy that I wasn\u2019t completely out of line.", "created_utc": 1675423923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10si6hg/aita_for_assuming_i_should_get_paid_for_my_time/", "score": 419, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From experience, a lot of family owned places operate on favour basis if they are in a tough spot. Helped out myself sometimes, and you saying you would \"help out if they are ever stuck\" implies to me that you are offering a favour so I don't think your friend is an AH for understanding it like that.

If you didn't work for him, he would have had to close the bar that night. The bar isn't a charity. People don't get to go there and drink for free. Similarly, you shouldn't be expected to work for free especially when you worked that shift entirely by yourself.\n\nHe should be paying you somehow. Ideally with cash in hand. Another option would be giving you \"store credit\" that you can redeem for free drinks until he finishes paying you what those seven hours of work are worth.\n\nBut simply saying \"you know I can't afford to pay staff\" is not going to cut it. You weren't \"extra staff.\" You were the only staff. How much cash did the bar bring in on that busy Saturday night?

You were covering for a longtime friend with a family emergency, most would assume you would not be paid or refuse it if offered. It sounds like the work got out of hand and bit excessive so your friend could have offered you money and reasonably should have.

No. But I think you need to let it go this time and learn lessons for next time.", "Currently, NAH. You would be if you insisted though.\n\nHere's the thing. He did tell you he cannot afford to pay staff, and you, off the back of that, offered to 'help out' if needed. That's vague, and understandably you meant 'for pay as a temp employee' and he heard 'for free as a friend thing'. When he asked for help, he gave no indication that the \"cannot pay people\" thing had changed, and offered no promise of payment, and you agreed without asking about either of those things. Again, he understandably thinks you're doing a friend a favour, you understandably think you're working for pay.\n\nIt sucks that this miscommunication happened, and in future be sure to make agreements before taking on anything, even if it's just a \"to clarify, can you pay me X?\". Thing is, he probably wouldn't have asked if he thought he had to pay, and if you'd asked for it he likely would have declined and tried to find other help, so he can't after the fact find money he doesn't have. Insisting on him paying you when you know he can't would be unreasonable, and even if he does manage to scrape the cash together, it's likely to be the end of the friendship. Up to you if the money is worth that, of course, but reasonable way forward is to chalk it up as a learning experience, be clear and demand clarity in future, and don't mix employers and friends if you have literally any other choice.", "NAH\n\nHe probably understood your offer of help to be favor based, but you deserve to be paid for running a for profit business. I mean, they could have easily just closed the bar that night if it really was an emergency. \n\nI personally would drop this one incident and no longer agree to help in the future. Hopefully you made some tips. If he truly can't afford to pay you, the least he could do is give you some free drinks next time you're in his bar.", "Difficult. They should really offer you something by way of compensation rather than you having to ask, even if it's just free drinks for the night..

He did this to *make money.* Why is that not registering here? Exploitation isn't a favor and OP was right not to assume he was going to be illegally exploited by his \"friend.\"**\n\nHiring staff, even for an emergency, means you pay them. It's a pretty automatic and legally required concept. \n\nYou can't legally \"have a buddy do a favor\" by using his unpaid labor to benefit yourself, and both parties knew that.\n\nOn top of that, exactly when during the emergency should he have brought it up??\n\nWhy exactly is it okay to exploit OPs labor for free to you?", "Problem is most people now pay with credit cards and include the tip on the card.

You should have been clear about your terms and agreed on wages before taking on the work shifts. Tell him you can't work for free and will no longer cover the bar for him. No anger, just a resolution of the situation.", "NTA. Your friend should at least give you a free night of beers since you're also a regular customer.", "NTA \n\nSure, y\u2019all should have discussed it ahead of time. But I think it was very implied that this type of labor should be compensated. You are literally earning him money while you were working for a long time.", "NTA - and now you know he's not a friend\n\nNote that his family would have been out 100's or 1000's of 'dollars' if you hadn't come in, I guess there was no value in that to their 'business'  (charity?)", "NTA but you are the one who assumed you would be paid as an employee. Your friend should have at least offered a thank you gesture of some kind. Take it as experience and be better for the knowledge.", "He said he was in a non-tipping country and didn't make any.", "FYI, you're currently the top comment, you'll need to edit to include a specific \"NTA\" if you want credit!", "Especially since OP had worked for payment in the bar in the past.  And 7 hours is a full shift.  It's so reasonable to expect that this was just another shift.  It's pretty crappy of the \"friend\" to take advantage like that.", "NTA, but learn from your mistake. Don\u2019t accept offers of work until payment has been agreed.", "Kind of the AH. Saying to a friend \u201cif you\u2019re stuck and need me to help out I will\u201d makes it sound like you\u2019re volunteering your time to help free of charge since you know they can\u2019t pay for staff right now. If you said \u201ci understand you can\u2019t pay now but if things change and you need me to work a shift let me know.\u201d Sounds like miscommunication so it\u2019s kind of an AH move to ask for pay after it looks like you volunteered your time to help a friend. Especially when you know financially things are tough. Maybe ask for some free drinks as a compromise?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDo you get your drinks for free? Of course not. You definitely should get paid, the full rate, the full hours. This is not up for discussion. This friendship is toast either way. What a jerk.", "NTA but you've learnt something very important about your friend- he's happy to take advantage of his friends", "NTA.  yea, sounds like your friend is an asshole.  that he didn't pay you at all, like if my friend did me a favor like that and i thought it was a freebie but then later i found out he was expecting pay, i'd probably give him at least what i had on me at the time.", "Once he understood there was a misunderstanding he should have paid you since it was SEVEN hours until TWO in the morning. That goes beyond a favor.", "feels like it's been dead for a while now that i'm getting a good look at it.", "Thank you", "NTA \n\n>I\u2019d rather stay friends and chalk it down to experience. I love him dearly and he\u2019s not a bad person.\n\n>friend asks me if I could come and cover the bar for a few hours as he and his family had to attend a family emergency out of town\n\n\nHe is a bad person. I'm calling BS in the \"emergency\". How did it go from a couple of hours to the entire evening? He didn't even call you. I have a feeling that he only told you a couple of hours on purpose he really meant the entire evening. \n\nConsidering that you were only expected to be there for a couple of hours and then it was the rest of the evening it would be the decent thing to do to pay you.\n\nFrom now on ask everyone when they ask you a *favor* how much they're going to pay you. I have a feeling if it happens again and if you ask this friend he's going to have a problem with it and expect you to work for free.", "If you like to go to the bar, maybe compromise with a barter. Free drinks until you\u2019re paid adequately. NTA, but he is.", "Esh is what I would say both of you assumed different things and it lead to a disagreement you should establish that if you are to help in the future you expect to be paid and he said he couldn't afford to pay extra staff", "NTA", "NTA you should the very least get your tips . At least next time you know you ask before hand of a payment before doing anything for anyone.", "NTA. Sounds like the friendship is just one sided.  Any good friends would have offer some type of monetary or even free drinks for helping a entire shift. Stop letting people take advantage of you.", "I hate that you\u2019re dropping it to save your friendship. How he\u2019s treating you and your time has already ruined the friendship in my eyes."]}
