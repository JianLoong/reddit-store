He said to me that he would no longer be able to give me any work as they would not be able to make ends meet by paying staff, so he and his family were going to run the place themselves. This was completely fine by me as the job was only ever going to be a temporary fix and I had since found a day job elsewhere anyway. I said to him that if he was ever stuck in the future I would be more than happy to help out. He thanked me and that was that. I started going in just as a regular customer and loved that one of my oldest friends was running my local bar. \n\nAnyway, skip to last week and the friend asks me if I could come and cover the bar for a few hours as he and his family had to attend a family emergency out of town, which of course I did. It was a busy Saturday night and I was completely on my own with no help but I didn\u2019t mind as I was just concerned about my friends situation and wanted to help. A few hours turned into the entire evening and I ended up being there around 7 hours with no break and didn\u2019t leave until about 2am.\n\nNow here\u2019s the dilemma. This was never discussed prior to me starting the shift but I assumed the friend would pay me for my time. I didn\u2019t ask for the money when I left that evening as I could tell everyone was upset and exhausted when they returned so I figured I would just go over later in the week to collect it. A few days went by and there was no mention of pay from my friend so yesterday I decided to text him to gently remind him.

From experience, a lot of family owned places operate on favour basis if they are in a tough spot. Helped out myself sometimes, and you saying you would \"help out if they are ever stuck\" implies to me that you are offering a favour so I don't think your friend is an AH for understanding it like that.

If you didn't work for him, he would have had to close the bar that night. The bar isn't a charity. People don't get to go there and drink for free. Similarly, you shouldn't be expected to work for free especially when you worked that shift entirely by yourself.\n\nHe should be paying you somehow. Ideally with cash in hand.

You were covering for a longtime friend with a family emergency, most would assume you would not be paid or refuse it if offered. It sounds like the work got out of hand and bit excessive so your friend could have offered you money and reasonably should have.

No. But I think you need to let it go this time and learn lessons for next time.", "Currently, NAH. You would be if you insisted though.\n\nHere's the thing. He did tell you he cannot afford to pay staff, and you, off the back of that, offered to 'help out' if needed. That's vague, and understandably you meant 'for pay as a temp employee' and he heard 'for free as a friend thing'. When he asked for help, he gave no indication that the \"cannot pay people\" thing had changed, and offered no promise of payment, and you agreed without asking about either of those things. Again, he understandably thinks you're doing a friend a favour, you understandably think you're working for pay.\n\nIt sucks that this miscommunication happened, and in future be sure to make agreements before taking on anything, even if it's just a \"to clarify, can you pay me X?\". Thing is, he probably wouldn't have asked if he thought he had to pay, and if you'd asked for it he likely would have declined and tried to find other help, so he can't after the fact find money he doesn't have. Insisting on him paying you when you know he can't would be unreasonable, and even if he does manage to scrape the cash together, it's likely to be the end of the friendship. Up to you if the money is worth that, of course, but reasonable way forward is to chalk it up as a learning experience, be clear and demand clarity in future, and don't mix employers and friends if you have literally any other choice.", "NAH\n\nHe probably understood your offer of help to be favor based, but you deserve to be paid for running a for profit business. I mean, they could have easily just closed the bar that night if it really was an emergency. \n\nI personally would drop this one incident and no longer agree to help in the future. Hopefully you made some tips. If he truly can't afford to pay you, the least he could do is give you some free drinks next time you're in his bar.", "Difficult. They should really offer you something by way of compensation rather than you having to ask, even if it's just free drinks for the night..

He did this to *make money.* Why is that not registering here? Exploitation isn't a favor and OP was right not to assume he was going to be illegally exploited by his \"friend.\"**\n\nHiring staff, even for an emergency, means you pay them. It's a pretty automatic and legally required concept. \n\nYou can't legally \"have a buddy do a favor\" by using his unpaid labor to benefit yourself, and both parties knew that.\n\nOn top of that, exactly when during the emergency should he have brought it up??\n\nWhy exactly is it okay to exploit OPs labor for free to you?", "Problem is most people now pay with credit cards and include the tip on the card. That means not only did his \"friend\" not pay the legally mandated minimum wage for a tipped employee, but he also stole the tips!", "He cannot afford regular staff, and also doesn't need it - that's why he fired OP, no hard feelings about that.\n\nBut he needed staff for one shift, so he hired OP for one shift.\n\nHow on Earth would a sane person assume, someone will work for them for free?\n\nAnd an assumption, that someone would make money for you and not be compensated makes \"the friend\" an entitled AH.", "The question here is should OP have \u201cassumed\u201d they were getting paid.

Is OP\u2019s friend an AH ... maybe but without all the information it\u2019s tough to tell. For all we know OP made bank in tips & their wages would be minuscule so what\u2019s the point of chasing down this $$ from your \u201coldest friend\u201d whose family just went through some stuff. For all we know OP has never paid for any drinks at friends bar & owes them a favor. There are a lot of pieces missing from this puzzle. \n\nAlso... Day workers or casual workers are not \u201chired\u201d employees of the business. Unless they are paid over a certain amount annually their \u201cwages\u201d do not have to be reported & they can be paid in cash, in beer, in gift certificates, scratch tickets, etc. As a business owner I cannot pay anyone \u201cwages\u201d without the appropriate signed documentation. OP\u2019s friend took over the bar & OP was immediately let go. OP never worked for friend\u2019s establishment so they were never an employee of that business. Perhaps, friend could have taken money out of the drawer & paid cash however OP was not an employee that could be paid wages because they were never hired.", "I\u2019m sticking with my ESH, but leaning a bit more toward your side. I just think that when a friend says they can\u2019t afford to pay for staff, and your response is well let me know if you get stuck and I can \u201chelp\u201d, that message can get misunderstood. \nI\u2019m leaning in your direction because of the legalities, but I also wonder if I would be a little more receptive to your arguments if you weren\u2019t so aggressive.", "[removed]", "Perhaps I wouldn't be so aggressive if you weren't literally advocating for labor exploitation by someone in a position of power.\n\nSorry I was too direct about that? I didn't insult you, I wasn't rude, and I said nothing offensive.\n\nI'm just aggressive in my position about not exploiting poor people. Guess I'm the AH.", "Wow, thanks for that clever insight and well thought out commentary.\n\n**Oh, you're the previous commenter who just created a new fake account to say this. Got it.**", "NTA - I hope you kept all the tips at least", "NTA. Working alone for 7 hours is not a \"favour\", it is work. If you can't afford to pay people who work for you, close the place.\n\nUnfortunately, it sounds like if you insist on payment, he will not take it well. So it is up for you to decide if you want to keep this friendship as it is, but most definitely never help him again.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s working a full shift, you should be paid. Surely whoever was set to be working that night would\u2019ve been paid appropriately so why should you be any different?\n\nThey could\u2019ve closed the bar for the night but instead they got you to run things on your own so they could still get an income. Struggling or not, they can\u2019t expect unpaid labour", "NTA. He is asking you to work. Actually work. He can pay you", "NTA. Helping a friend move or clean is one thing, but actually helping them out with there business where they are making money is another. I say absolutely say something. Also, I completely understand not wanting to lose a friend, but at the same time you shouldn't let someone take advantage of you like that. It is alot harder to stand up to a friend than it is to an enemy. You would have a case to sue as well", "INFO: this is a bar, I assume in the US? Whether or not he wants to pay you any wage, did you at least take the cash tips? How much in debit tips do you think he owes you? Just wondering.\n\nIf you got all your owed tips, I'd say the amount he owes you for hourly isn't worth a fight, regardless of who the asshole is. 7 hours at four dollars an hour ain't much. Write it off as a $30 value favour and move on. If he owes you tips, then NTA.", "NTA. Hope you got paid well in tips. Screw the wages unless you're in a tight spot financially. Don't ever accept to help him ever again. But feel free to ask him for a free favour in the future. Make sure it's something that'll piss him off lol.", "ESH both of you need to communicate better.  You should have clarified whether he would pay you or if you were doing this as a favour because of your friendship.  He also needs to understand 7 hours is a long time and as there was misunderstanding he should pay you.  Words matter \" call me if you need help\" seems like ok will do a favour for you especially after he stated he can't pay anyone else.  You should have stated \"if you ever need me to work for you in an emergency call me\".", "NTA\n\nBut your friend did make it clear in the beginning that he was not willing to pay for help. You didn't clarify your expected compensation for helping out. You, in fact, told him you would help if there was a need.\n\nI don't think you're the AH because most of us would compensate a friend's help in some way. Especially a 7hr job. But the compensation was never agreed upon.", "If you feel it\u2019s owed then speak to them about it . Personally If I\u2019m doing my friend a favour I\u2019m doing just that and don\u2019t expect anything in return but everyone is different\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA but going forward, I would make sure it's clear what is \"helping out\" vs. \"working and getting paid for it\".  If you're keeping the business open with your help, as in this case, you were working.  You should have been paid or compensated somehow (ex. free drinks on the house for while etc.).\n\nNext time, I'm assuming you will not \"help\" out anymore.\n\nThey would have been better off to close if they couldn't afford to compensate you somehow.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nIf it had been an hour it wouldn't of been an issue but you covered a bar basically by yourself for 7 hours with no break. You did an entire shift and he thinks he shouldn't pay you.\n\nnever do it for him again", "NTA- if you can\u2019t afford to pay staff, you can\u2019t afford to run your business.  \n\nPersonally I\u2019d let this one go depending on how much I valued the friendship, but I\u2019d never help again unless it was spelled out how I\u2019d be compensated", "Nta. This wasn\u2019t covering a few minutes so he could use the bathroom. If he can\u2019t afford to give you cash for your shift he could at least give you a lifetime of free drinks.", "Your friend said: \"he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to pay extra staff\"-- granted but on that day you weren't EXTRA staff you were the ONLY staff.  Does this \"friend\" comp your drinks when you go there?  Did you at least make some tips during the time you worked?  NTA but your \"friend\" is.", "NTA. I totally get how a favor helping at the bar would be like: come to chop the prep fruit. Run the dishes. Give a hand sweeping up before opening. That's just helping a friend out, and then you go on with your day. But a 7 hour shift with no breaks? That's labor.", "NTA. You already did him a favour for last min filling in. So that\u2019s two favours. I suggest you look for a way that he can reciprocate, so you can get a promotion at your new job. Maybe through his contacts or maybe he knows someone from an old job that can offer you paid work. I won\u2019t bother pushing him for payment but gifts in kind.", "NTA. 7 hours is a full shift. Did you at least keep the tips?", "NTA your friend should at least give you credit at the bar for food and drink to pay you back.", "\" I assumed the friend would pay me \"? don\u00b4t do that anymore, never assume nothing.  all should be explicitly negotiated and agreed, specially with friends and family", "NTA your friend should at least give you credit at the bar for food and drink to pay you back.\n\nEdited to add: and if your friend didn\u2019t at least give you all your tips then he\u2019s a thief.", "You could come to a compromise  \nHe creates a  bar tab and credits your hours to that that way he wins (he pays less for beer than he is charging you )and you win by getting free beer", "This! If it wasn't for OP the bar wouldn't have made money on arguably the busiest day of the week, asking for a payment is completely fair and should've been offered to begin with!", "Yeah, I'd try to turn that money into bar credit before giving up. I'd message him that you are fine not getting paid in money, but he owes you 20 drinks. Then, when you go in next, \"pay\" by reducing the debt. I'd put a tally on a napkin and just mark it off.\n\nNext time, get an agreement to be paid before working. Or don't accept the work.", "IMHO: Compensation is a tacit agreement in this instance as it is ILLEGAL to not pay. Person is not a family member and the business is not a charity. Those are the only 2 circomstances where a person can \"donate\" time to a business.", "If that\u2019s the case, I think that hasn\u2019t been confirmed", "Is it a lawful requirement to pay people for work? \n\nThen YES, THE ASSUMPTION IS REASONABLE. \n\nAS A BUSINESS OWNER you KNOW you can't have someone come work as a \"favor,\" you know it damn well.\n\nOh, and you're incorrect. \n\nThey WERE rehired *when they were asked to work.*\n\nThe employment relationship existed the moment the individual *was asked to work.*\n\nYou know who thinks so? **Fucking DOLs Wage and Hour.**\n\nDidn't do paperwork prior? \n\n**You still have to pay.**\n\n**Every fucking thing you said was an illegal employment practice.**\n\n**So not ONLY did he not pay wages, which is illegal, he violated IRS rules by not paying trust fund taxes on those wages he's legally required to pay**.\n\nStop making excuses because you're a shitty business owner.\n\nOh, and NO, you CANNOT PAY \"DAY EMPLOYEES\" OR \"CASUAL WORKERS\" with **anything other than money, and you are always liable for trust find taxes.**\n\nThe INDIVIDUAL doesn't have to pay taxes below a certain threshold.\n\nBusiness owners like you are the reason people like me will always have a job, because nothing you said was correct in any way.\n\nEdit: This is **literally my job.**", "OP essentially \u201cvolunteered\u201d to help their friend. Volunteers are not paid. It is very legal to not pay people who willingly volunteer to do work at your business. Happens all the time. There are also people who intern, it is also not required to pay them for their work. So no... because a person does work does not automatically entitle them to be paid. \n\nIf OP had an expectation to be paid they should have discussed that before volunteering to do the work. It\u2019s pretty simple since OP was never hired as an employee of the business, taxes do not apply.\n\neta \u2014 I\u2019m not arguing with you about best practices for small businesses because it\u2019s not applicable for this post. This was between 2 friends who did not communicate properly. Their friend asked for help, they volunteered to help. Should they be paid... imo yes. And I hope they do but I don\u2019t own that bar so I can\u2019t affectively change anything for OP.", "No, he didn't, and you can't \"hire\" volunteers without meeting specific requirements. \n\nAnd you ABSOLUTELY cannot \"volunteer\" at alcohol establishments, **by law.**\n\nIt's pretty simple - you're legally incorrect."]}
