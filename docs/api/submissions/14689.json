On our way there, one of my friends (lets call him  P), says that his fwb was travelling close to the same city and got stuck there. He asks if she could stay with us for a night as she was alone in a strange city. We agreed as it seemed unsafe for her to wait at the bus station. However, she did not leave the next day and stayed for the rest of our five day trip, without even offering to pay her share. P also spent the entire trip with her and did not join us.\n\n On the last night, I had too much to drink and got mad at P for not telling her to leave, and essentially ruining the boys trip as we felt a bit uncomfortable with her in the airbnb. P insists that he is not wrong as we had extra room, and I am the asshole for making his fwb feel unwelcome. Our friend group has been pretty divided over this, as some agree that she was being rude not asking the rest of us if she could stay, and the others don't care. For context, P is one of my closest friends and this is not the first time the girl has invited herself when we hang out, and also said she was feeling upto the activities we were doing and dragged P along with her.

P and his conveniently stranded fwb are. A boys trip is a type of thing. If P didn\u2019t want to go, he shouldn\u2019t have gone. He ruined the vibe and removed himself from the trip\u2019s purpose. \n\nDon\u2019t invite him next time. \n\nBut if you do, make sure he understands out of the gate that if he has a \u201crandom friend in trouble without money\u201d he can rent a hotel room for them on his dime.", "NTA, P is the AH he knew what he did, i highly doubt she \" was close by and stuck\".  It sounds planned to me. I would stop going to outings if rules aren't made about others joining in after the fact, its not fair to everyone that she got a free ride off everyone.", "NTA. If girlfriends or fwb were invited then everyone would bring theirs. This sounds less like an oh I'm in town emergency stay and more like she was keeping tabs on him.

Come on.  She just happened to be on the other side of the country at the same time? She just happened to get stuck in the city and couldn't uber to a local hotel?

WTF? \n\n>P insists that he is not wrong as we had extra room\n\nNo, he is still wrong. It doesn't matter how many rooms you have. The deal is the deal.  You check in with everyone if you want to change it. What is worse is how many lies he tells to get what he wants.  You call this guy one of your best friends?  I think you should rethink what \"best\" means, because he is incredibly selfish.  He knew everyone wouldn't agree to this so he arranged for it all to happen. I had a friend like this and I stopped taking vacations with him.\n\nThe good news is if you do decide to take a trip with him again, there is no way anyone will believe she just happens to be where you are another time.  \n\nFor me, I wouldn't let this go until I got him to admit this was a setup, because it was.  If someone will lie to me about something like this, they will lie about other things too.  Get on the same page.  Call him out.  Let him know you don't appreciate the lies.  Let him know it is jeopardizing your friendship.", "NTA", "NTA - but P sure sounds like one, so does his on again/off again gal pal.  This was a planned trip \"guy trip\", she so happened to be \"stranded\" in the area, the group agreement was one night for her safety but she stayed the remaining five days, and then he ditched ya'll for her, and she didn't contribute towards anything, right?  That's BS!  I think your approach to the situation may have been a bit abrupt but you said what some others were feeling as well (since the group is split 50/50).  Should another trip happen - as a group, perhaps set some ground rules so should this situation happen again (and it most likely will), everyone is on the same page.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s in the wrong.", "EDIT:  change of judgement in following comment.  \n\n\nY T A leaning towards E S H because she should have offered to contribute financially.  As to the rest, it sounds like she, and P, and some of your friends, want to include her in the friend group.  You\u2019re allowed to dislike her as a person and not want to be her friend, but it\u2019s kinda weird that you don\u2019t even seem to consider her as potentially one of the group.  Do any of the rest of you have girlfriends or wives?  Are they never included?", "ESH \n\nYour friend invited his FWB (who sounds like his girlfriend tbh) and that was thoughtless of him since he knew it was a boy\u2019s trip and didn\u2019t ask ahead of time. \n\nI like how you say the girl invited herself and does this constantly but you friend apparently has no issue with it. He could always say no but he obviously wanted her there as he spent the whole trip with her. He used the Airbnb for a cheap romantic get away. \n\nYou, however, state you gave her the \u201ccold shoulder\u201d and made her feel \u201cunwelcome.\u201d There\u2019s no need to be rude to her.", "YTA i would say.\n\nIt's a shame that an unexpected event changed what you had in mind for the trip but I dont think it's fair to dictate to others what they do on their holiday, you should have tried to make the most of it rather than making things worse", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why wait until the end and then blow up?", "NTA.  P is the problem not her.  You need to stop inviting P or lay it out before you go that she is not welcome.  P didn't even hang out with you guys, so there is no reason to invite him in the future.", "NTA.  Who thinks it's ok to join someone else's group trip without having been specifically invited and welcome by every member of the group?  So rude and entitled.", "Last night is just exactly the time when discussion became useless. But given it is habit, you can discuss with others and set up rules before he asks the exact same question again.", "NTA, I had a roommate pull this on me in college... her bf just happened to be in the area we were visiting and next thing I knew I was the third wheel on \"their trip\" that I paid for.", "NTA- since everyone seems to be suggesting he planned this which seems feasible, recommend asking for her share of the rental fee.", "NTA\n\nthis happened to me once and it completely killed the trip\n\nfun fact tho the girl ended up dumping the AH for one of the guys she met on the trip lol \n\njoke's on you, Ted", "INFO: Did you or any of your friends communicate to P after the first night that you didn't want her staying longer, or ask if she can pay her share?", "Girls don't invite themselves.

I get along really well with the other friend's girlfriend because she joins in on our activities if she comes along. This trip was only about us guys though. I don't like P's fwb because she has cheated on him in the past and also because she ends up getting tired of whatever sport/activity we are doing (even though she invited herself) and convinces P to join her. P is usually too infatuated to refuse, which is why I got frustrated and was rethinking this friendship of years.", "I was more mad about her staying for the rest of the trip without asking us or offering to share the cost.", "Literally if the dude didn\u2019t want to spend time with you then oh well. He clearly had other priorities.", "maybe ESH", "I am not op, but people dont do these intentionally. No one ever says \"I will wait till the moment it is useless and then boil up\". Instead, they are angry but too shy to comment, they get too resentful and until alcohol lowers inhibitions. So they blow up at the wrong moment.", "Yeah like how dumb would you have to be to believe that she got stuck across the country and was miraculously close enough to join their trip.", "Okay, she does sound kind of terrible.  The problem isn\u2019t that P has a vaguely-significant other who wants to be included, the issue is that this person is a bad friend.  I\u2019ll revise to an ESH on that basis - you\u2019re trying to dance around the issue with P by objecting that she wasn\u2019t invited.  That\u2019s not the problem, the problem is that she sucks.", "But that\u2019s his own fault for not communicating then. Yeah they are assholes for assuming it was okay, but if not a single guy communicated that they\u2019d rather she leaves, then they\u2019re all responsible for this.", "It's quite obvious. Maybe a bit of naivety and/or seeing more the good in people."]}
