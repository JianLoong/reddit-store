He's TAH.", "NTA, and stop inviting him on trips.  He IMO used you and the trip just to hook up with her.

Especially since she's mooching?", "NTA - make P pay everyone the extra cost of having that uninvited person on the trip.", "What a coincidence that she was traveling so close and got stranded. NOT!  She totally planned that.  This woman is clearly a schemer and a liar.  She can\u2019t stand not having control over him.  She loves him and then rejects him.  She causes problems in his other relationships, which will isolate him and make him easier to manipulate.\n\nThis woman sounds like a narcissist.

I would have been so uncomfortable if I were her. \n\nYou have every right to be annoyed. Please die on this hill and stop going on trips with him.", "NTA..BUT what the heck is an fwb?", "I think we all know it was planned.", "Yeah, this was obvious at Sentence #2. \n\n I can't believe he not only planned this-or at least went along with her plan-but got angry when you called him out. \n\n Cross him off your Christmas list, bro!", "You sound like a better person than me.

Just normal etiquette. \n   Either P knows this and is gaslighting you, or he\u2019s so far gone on her that she convinced him it\u2019s fine.

What's not ok is over staying your welcome on a trip you know you weren't invited to.", "Or..hear me out...don't fucking over stay your welcome. They said it was for one night for safety reasons. That sounds reasonable, I agree. But how unsafe was it that she had to stay the remainder of the trip?", "You don't over stay your welcome either.
