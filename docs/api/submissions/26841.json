Stay well clear.", "NTA mom is mad because she will have to care for her child that she hasn't set boundaries and expectations with. Sister is upset she can't freeload. Don't budge. Don't give money. Babysit less so you have time for you to search for places and relax. Move out peacefully preferably when they are not there for less drama.", "NTA. Youre not respobsible for her poor choices.", "NTA, and you don't even need to leave them your forwarding address.", "NTA, you have expressed yourself clearly and with unbelievably good reasons.

Your mom is seeing your sister moving in with you as a chance for her to catch her breath with your sister\u2019s dramas but that\u2019s not your job. As someone who\u2019s also a younger sister with a problematic older sister, don\u2019t shoulder the responsibilities of your older sibling and neglect these formative years that are your 20s. You deserve to grow and flourish independently.", "NTA.  Run and run far.  You nailed it.  Your mom and sister are just looking to you to financially support your sister, take care of her kids and put up with her loser partner.  Go live your life.  If mom wants your sister to be take care of then she can do it herself - not your job.", "Nta. Run hun run!! It's not going to get better and you will be on the hook for everything. Time for your sister to grow up and be a mother.", "NTA that sounds like a terrible idea, don't do it. It's a trap. If you do get a place with her you will end up as free childcare too", "NTA - !! Wow. I\u2019m sorry. You are not the bank for the family. I can appreciate you helping out the the ways you feel are best within whatever boundaries you feel are appropriate. But you are not responsible for supporting everyone. Your sister needs therapy. She needs to get herself together and support her family. You can help however you want but it should never be mandatory or forced.", "nope NTA DONT CAVE", "NTA..This is wrong on SOOOO many levels. Move out and block your toxic family out of your life.", "NTA\n\nIf your mother is tired of supporting your sister, she can kick her out, but you absolutely have no obligation to take over.\n\nMove out, stop babysitting, and tell your mother that your sister needs to get a job to help with the bills.", "Right?!?!
