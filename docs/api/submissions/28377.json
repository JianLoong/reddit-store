She will always be a person who thought her life was going to be lived one way, with one person, and that life was irrevocably lost to her in an instant. This scar will always be with her and is part of what makes her beautiful. \n\nWhat you are saying to her, by asking her to hide these remnants of that life, is that the scar is unbearable to you. It's ugly and should be hidden away. I don't get the sense that this is what you're trying to say to her, but I can imagine this is how it lands.\n\nJust like you expanded your heart to include your child, so too she expanded her heart to include you both. There is not less room for you because she loved someone else before you.\n\nI think what you should do is talk to a therapist, who can help you get at the root of this insecurity you have about your wife's past, untangle it, and keep it from choking you and the very lovely life you've created. YWBTA if you don't.  Good luck.", "Why does she have to give up the things he gave her? Why does she have to get rid of pictures of a life before you? \n\nIt sounds like she is focused on you.

Sounds to me like you're focused on her dead fiance.", "You seem to think you should get some kind of credit for \u201cnot pressuring her to forget him\u201d vocally. You don\u2019t.

Are those items interfering in your lives together, taking up too much space? FYI, you are in fact now disrespecting her grief and \"pressuring her to forget him.\"", "YTA even when I can feel how you feel. You should be able to communicate your feelings without demanding something from her. Also when you moved together/married her/had a kid with her, you knew about these things, right?", "> But I am bothered because I feel like she hasn't completely moved on from him, and I'm just a replacement.\n\nThis really is a you problem and you need to have enough self confidence to quit competing in your mind with a dead guy.

Be a bigger man.", "INFO where does she keep these things?", "> I\u2019ve always respected her grief and never pressured her to forget him. \n\nSo what\u2019s changed?\n\nYTA. How is she not focused on you or your child? It sounds like you\u2019re letting insecurity over a deceased lover turn into resentment toward your wife. \n\nYou knew what the risks were getting involved with a widow. She will always be a widow and her late fiancee will always be a part of her. You\u2019re being insecure about possessions that mean an incredible amount to your wife. Under no circumstances should she be obligated to get rid of them. Seek therapy to work through your issue.", "YTA. Store, yes. Get rid of, no. Not your purview.", "Let her honor his memory and grieve how she wants. All of this is part of her, the woman you fell in love with. It takes nothing from you. It might help her with the trauma.

My now husband was there for me and our kids during my late husband\u2019s death (Now hubby was also my 1st hubby). He knows that me and the kids still love my late husband. As he put it, he knows that I have enough love for both of them and our kids were lucky to have another parent who loved them. I don\u2019t have many pictures up simply due to my late husband avoiding the camera but he knows there are a few.

She loved this person.  She is with you.  She has moved on.  To you.  That doesn\u2019t mean her previous experiences are gone.  Nor is the love.  I have my wedding ring, his riding boots, even his ashes (hanging in a small keychain thing) in my garage, of my late husband.  My current husband is absolutely fine with this.

Personally I could understand some jewellery, maybe a few small keepsakes, but to still have clothes and pictures around, I think that speaks to a lack of her being able to completely move on. I think something this senstive needs addressed properly in couples counselling or something like that, where you can both express yourselves without the worry of it being misinterpreted or coming across wrong and you can be guided in how to move forward as a team.", "That\u2019s a lot to spread around the house.

But I can appreciate it is hard to see these things dotted through your home. You need to talk to her about why it's so important that they are visible in your home. And find a way forward that works for the two of you. Your children won't be confused if you talk to them openly about what they are and why they are important to your wife. Has she been in therapy to discuss the loss? Grief has a horrid way of jumping out at you when you least expect it. So be kind. Talk it through, tell her how it makes you feel. Don't give her solutions just hear her words. Sometimes we try to rush people to our wanted outcome, but they need to find their solution. But talk. This kind of thing can become a thorn and fester poluting everything else. Maybe get the kids looked after for a night so you can talk freely without distraction.\nLet us know how it goes.

People are not allowed to have photos around of loved ones who have passed away? There\u2019s nothing weird about keeping photos, an engagement ring, or other mementos associated with a loved one who has died. The fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t an ex, he is someone who has died.

For me, that's where you move into asshole territory. When he died, those items became her items. You don't think she should keep her previous engagement ring in the house you two share? That's absurd. You can ask her not to have things out on display and ask her not to store them where they are a hindrance (like if his clothes are taking up space in your closet, suggest boxing them for under the bed or other out-of-the-way places).", "She has some framed photos of him on the wall.
