A proper understanding of grief would help both of you, I think. But, I am confused. Was this person her fiance when they passed away? Because that doesn't make her a widow. It also doesn't invalidate her grief. Grief can overwhelm us and supplant everything in our lives. If she really is still grieving this person, it is taking away from your marriage. Counseling for her and for you would probably be helpful. Is she possibly too tied to these items and memories, and why is it bothering you to this extent? These are questions a qualified person can assist you with. Regardless of her previous marital status, she took legally and possibly spiritually binding vows with you, so you should be her focus. I have counseled people in similar situations before, most often the refusal to not be surrounded by tokens or mementos is from an internal turmoil, a feeling of guilt or betrayal of the deceased. A fear that they will forget them if they aren't constantly surrounded by reminders of them. This is torturous, and also a sign that the person is still actively grieving their loss. I'd wager that the deceased wouldn't want their loved one feeling this way. You both deserve the freedom to be happy together without guilt, building the life that you promised each other when you got married and started your family.", "NTA\n\nBecause photos on the walls and clothes in the closet are unreasonable things.\n\nShe hasn't dealt with her grief and at this point I can see why you think you are the replacement but her loyalty remains to him.\n\nThere is a very big difference between having an album or two of their time together in the book case and even if the clothing was folded up and placed in a container/bag on a shelf in a cupboard v's out in the open 6+ years after she met you.\n\nI'd be suggesting counselling for the both of you but she may not be open to it so just start with you.\n\nYour 2 year old is going to start asking questions about the man in the photos on the wall and asking why he never sees you wearing the men's clothing in her cupboard.\n\nThis guy was an important part of your wife's past but that's where it should be.

All I have to do is change the judgment:\n\nI am so tired of people who are jealous of the dead even though their partner gives them no reason to be.\n\nI am so tired of people who refuse to accept that their partner\u02bbs past is a part of them and part of what made their partner into the person that they love.\n\nThis is one of my favorite quotes on the subject. It\u02bbs from the television show Designing Women\n\n>He said, \"Julia Sugarbaker..\" -- he's an attorney, very theatrical, but anyway -- \"Julia Sugarbaker, you just keep all the memories and pictures of Hayden McIlroy that you want to, because, quite frankly, I don't think I'd want to be with a woman who tried to stop loving her husband just because he died.\" You see, I'd been thinking that it was an either/or proposition. I wasn't thinking that it could be all three of us.\n\nGive me someone wise enough, mature enough and secure enough to say that.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  \"She says I'm being insensitive and selfish. She says I can't erase her past and that I should accept her as she is. She says she loves me, and that's what matters.\" She's right. I still have a coin my grandfather gifted my when I was 9. I'm 44. Some people hang onto sentimental items. It doesn't mean they haven't moved on. You need to listen to your wife.  \\*edit, forgot a verdict", "YTA. As someone who\u2019s been in her position and people I\u2019ve dated have eventually asked me to get rid of photos or clothes or jewellery or my engagement ring it\u2019s massively insensitive. \n\nYour insecurities are your own and you need to stop projecting them onto your wife. Your essentially in a weird way competing with a man who\u2019s dead. \n\nPlease get some therapy before you accidentally destroy your marriage by pushing for her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do.", "YTA\nYou're being insecure about a couple of sentimental items that you've said are in cupboards, draws etc except for a few photos. \nYour son won't get confused if you explain who the man is if he asks. \nYou met your wife 2 years after his passing so you're not a rebound, she married you and nothing about your post indicates that she doesn't make you and/or your child her priority so why is it an issue?", "Lol, \"it would be better for both of us\" and the rest of the post is all about you you you, your feelings, and your absurd idea that your kid will think you're not his dad.\n\nDude, you married a widow. She did move on, but she's not going to stop being a widow, and she shouldn't have to pretend that she's not one.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, she has point when she says you can\u2019t change her past. I mean, she didn\u2019t break up with him, he died. I do understand these things are maybe a bit much. But you need to let go of the feelings of feeling like a replacement or her not having moved on. I mean, she wouldn\u2019t have married you or had a child with you if she hadn\u2019t moved on. Maybe you can find a compromise here? Like, have her pick her favorite picture and the engagement ring and keep that in a place (not the bedroom) where she can still see it. But kindly ask her to box up the other things and store them in the attic or basement if you have those. She doesn\u2019t have to get rid of it, but having his clothing still around is a little, much. Also, if you explain things to your son (or she does, or even better, you explain together) who he was, your kid will never have to doubt his paternity. But basically, talk calmly to your wife. Do not mention feeling like a replacement (unless it is a huge deal and you really need to bring it up, maybe in couples counseling) or thinking that your won will get confused. Have an honest conversation and let her speak. Maybe some sessions with a counselor wouldn\u2019t be bad. But be kind and understanding. Edit: NAH", "I wanted to ask who owns the house?

You aren\u2019t replacing your wife\u2019s lost partner because you are also her partner. She can hold space in her heart for both of you and it is never going to be \u201cin competition.\u201d Those of us with this kind of loss and grief are different than others who haven\u2019t experienced it and that helps us cope and continue on with our lives.
