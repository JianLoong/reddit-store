This is my parents' old second home, my parents gave it to me when I moved out of the family home 5 years ago. Helen and I are very happy with this house because it is comfortable and well located.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is just a little problem with the kitchen, there are two ovens, one big and one smaller. The small one works well but sometimes the big one cuts off the power when it switches off (you just have to turn the power back on the meter). It is not everytime, maybe once in five times but to avoid that, I always use the small oven which was more than enough when I was living alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Helen moved in, at first we took turns cooking but she quicky insisted to manage the cooking alone, she thinks my cooking is a bit too basic. Her parents own a restaurant so I guess she has higher standards and she cooks better than me tbf.. I once suggested that we could cook together sometimes so I could improve but she doesn't want because she finds me too messy in the kitchen..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI warned her about the big oven and to prioritize the smaller one or to let me know before using the big one. I like to play Football Manager on my PC before dinner and it would be a shame to have a power cut at this moment. If she tells me beforehand, I can save my game in case of a cut\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 weeks ago Helen used the big oven without telling me and the power went out, while I was playing. I gently remembered her to warn next time and it's ok, I had saved a few minutes before, and everyone can forget or mess up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday she wanted to make cookies and used the big oven again without telling me, I was playing, and I hadn't saved for several in-game weeks (stupid, I know) so it was lost. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was annoyed and I asked why she didn't warn me. Instead of apologising she said aggresively to get over it, that I shouldn't get upset about that stupid game, after all cooking the dinner was much more important. I got angry and answered that she shouldn't disrespect my hobbies like that and she could just enjoy her so much important dinner alone and I stormed off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to visit a friend (24M) to vent, and I ended up sleeping there (I told my gf by message that I will sleep there and it's best to talk tomorrow). My friend thinks that Helen messed up and is in the wrong but this morning, I received a text from a friend a Helen calling me a huge asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reflecting about it, I start to feel bad, maybe I did overreact or was completly in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA\u00a0?", "created_utc": 1681907298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rrl6i/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_gf_after_she_turned/", "score": 305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or have the electrical problem fixed?  Or get rid of the big oven so she can't use it?   I think storming out and spending the night at your friends is an overreaction.

You should get it checked out ASAP.", "Here\u2019s my issue with this post. Instead of fixing the electrical and breaker box you are now asking for your gf to either tell you every time she wants to cook or use an oven that is too small for the task at hand. Then you yelled at her for it. And while I do think she came in a bit hot in her defense, you are claiming she doesn\u2019t respect your hobbies because she is cooking you dinner and providing food in the house. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m between E S h and Y T A. \n\nInfo: has there been any effort to fix the electricity? Was it just asking or did you accuse her of ruining your hobbies/day/game?

Especially because of how you describe her being \u201cfed up\u201d with you trying to cook and being messy in the kitchen. Personally when I see that it makes my brain go to weaponized incompetence. Maybe I\u2019m wrong there but my spidey senses are tingling.\n\nEdit: ive thought about it. YTA.

The reason I am so firm in this vote is because THREE different sets of cousins living thousands of miles apart have had fires from very similar causes. One lost her whole house.

Apologise to your girl and get the damn electrician to fix the problem.", "You are both in the wrong.\n\nFirstly, you asked her to simply warn you when she needed to use the big oven. I don\u2019t see why she finds that so difficult? \n\nI also find it frustrating when people think gaming as a hobby is stupid. It\u2019s something you like to do and she should respect that, it\u2019s no different from doing anything else as a hobby.\n\nLastly, you could have also prevented this argument. You know there is an issue with the big cooker. If it keeps on tripping the electrics that is usually a sign that there is something wrong with it.

When she\u2019s cooking not just for you but the whole family? Or even when she just has her friends over and needs the big oven? What then? She has to use it then. Are you going to complain every time the power trips? Just get the stupid thing fixed!!!", "YTA. She's in the kitchen making your dinner while you game, and you're angry that she forgot to ask your permission? That's not reasonable, you overreacted.

Instead of playing games, maybe update the oven or the house so it doesn't do that.   If it is faulty wiring the house could burn down.   If I was her I would refuse to cook until you fixed the problem.   I mean you are complaining about playing a game while she is cooking and doing adult things.", "ESH\n\nShe forgot to warn you, but you yourself didn't think about saving your game for in-game weeks. So both are to blame. And both are now fighting in stead of owning up to your own oversights.", "YTA - there's something seriously wrong with the wiring in your home if the breaker is tripping. Hire an electrician or keep risking fire.  Also, instead of playing games while your GF is making your food, help her or socialize with her.", "YTA.

If you know it's that big of a deal, replace the oven or get an electrician.", "Using an appliance should not trip a breaker repeatedly. It means either the appliance is pulling too much load or there is a weak breaker. It should be easy enough for any electrician to diagnose and if it's just a weak breaker should be a cheap enough fix. Replacing the oven or rewiring wouldn't be, but also should continue to be used for safety reasons.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nWho cares about your stupid game ? You should get someone to look at what's wrong with the fucking oven instead of acting like a child. \n\nI guess that's what happens when mommy and daddy give you a house for free....", "NTA\n\nWhile the issue is trivial, it does show her incompetency to warn you about something she\u2019ll do, which could have greater effects", "NTA, but sorry to tell you OP, you won't win here. You have committed two cardinal reddit sins- being a man in a conflict with his female partner, and enjoying video games. \n\nI'm married to a man who plays games and as long as you aren't toxic and throwing tantrums when you lose progress, it's okay to be disappointed. I'm a reader and got locked out of my goodreads account and had to start over and was a little sad. Her telling you to \"get over it\" was not cool. That's not how you respond when your partner is upset and being reasonable. It's reasonable to ask for a warning. I do think spending the night with a friend was dramatic. I get leaving to think and calm down for a bit but all night?\n\nSince she doesn't respect your hobby (it took me some time too, I won't lie) it's probably in your best interest to look into getting the oven fixed. Not to mention it seems like an electrical issue and you don't want an electrical fire. I hope once you both calm down you can work it out. You both overreacted a bit.", "ESH - you go whining off to a friends house after that tiny disagreement?

She is still doing you a service by cooking for you, and I also know that often times gamers (myself included) get really into what they're doing, so as simple as it sounds to just tell someone beforehand, there is a chance you won't be focused on what is being said.

Gaming is fine, but other hobbies are good too, especially ones where you get out of the house and move around. Lastly, get the oven fixed. There is no good reason to have faulty wiring in your house, that is dangerous.

I'm sure OP would have no problem fending for himself.", "Yeah you're probably right, I didn't want to call an electrician out of working hours because it is very expensive, so I wanted to wait for my next off weeks, but I guess I will do it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't say she's not respecting my hobby because of the power cut, it was more about her reaction and calling it stupid game, it was not the first time she uses this kind of words", "I was going to say this. Most people don\u2019t have time for this nonsense (I know I wouldn\u2019t and it seems like his girlfriend doesn\u2019t either). Instead of easily fixing his problem, he throws a tantrum and storms off for the night. YTA.", "Calling them and being available when they actually come to do the work are separate things.", "That may be expensive as it probably means it needs a dedicated circuit ran from the panel, assuming the panel has space left for that.  It would be a lot easier to just use the oven you know works or just disconnect this faulty oven entirely.", "It's pretty unreasonable to have one of the major appliances in your kitchen cut the power 1 in 5 times you turn it on. \n\nIf I moved in to this I would walk right back out. How do you not call an electrician in FIVE YEARS over something like this? It could be a fire hazard ffs.", "then all the more reason the GF shouldn't use the large one, and use the small one.", "\"hand that feeds him\" she was making cookies not fucking dinner", "SHE created this problem by using the large oven. your forgetting the part where there's a perfectly functional small over to use. maybe she should just use the small and stop being a AH", "no, its not. its OP's home, that GF lives in. they break up, she doesn't have any claim to it. there is a real simple solution to this, she shouldn't use the large oven, and just use the small one. OP should honestly just unplug it. \n\nbut hey since you think its also part her home, maybe since she's the one using it SHE should fix it. OP seem to get by fine using the small oven", "Gaming is a recognized form of healthy escapism and self care/wind down time by therapists and psychologists. Everyone has an escape route. If this was reading when she made the lights go out there would be no difference", "Disagree on the landlord comparison, but that\u2019s a whole other issue, and I DO agree he needs to fix it or get rid of the broken oven *as a homeowner*.\n\nYour comparisons claim that he\u2019d get upset at her for USING the oven if they had a family or friends, when there\u2019s nothing to suggest that\u2019s the case. He\u2019s only gotten upset when he\u2019s not told beforehand. Again, he SHOULD fix it. He should also save his game. But you\u2019re making up scenarios and attributing a reaction to OP that just isn\u2019t supported. \n\n(Also, he didn\u2019t save for \u201cin game weeks\u201d and I have no clue how long that actually is, could be days, could be hours, could be 30 minutes of real time)\n\nYou seem upset about the fact that he was given the house. That has no bearing here other than that he owns it now and is responsible for fixing things (which most people, including me, have already stated needs to be fixed). \n\nDid OP mess up by not saving? Yes. Should OP fix his oven? Yes. Does OP get upset when Helen uses the oven and does let him know? There\u2019s literally nothing to suggest that, which is what you\u2019re arguing. \nYou\u2019re being disingenuous or purposefully obtuse to make claims about OP complaining every time she uses that oven when that\u2019s simply not the case. He complained twice, both times that he wasn\u2019t told, and the OP doesn\u2019t mention anything about complaining that she uses the broken oven too much, only that he didn\u2019t get a warning.", "It depends. If the house is old and there is another reason it flipps the breaks, to protect other technology, and potential work for example, might still be worth a shot imo.\nHis first solution was to not use the oven \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd2d\n\nIf it was such a danger though they should go back to not use it until it\u2019s fixed.", "I said nothing about video games == child. \n\nHere\u2019s why he\u2019s not an adult:\n\nHe doesn\u2019t take care of his house\n\nHe can\u2019t have discussions about hard topics \n\nHe runs away instead of talking calmly\n\nHe can\u2019t take responsibility for his own actions\n\nHe doesn\u2019t learn from his mistakes", "This, it seems like he's been living by himself for 5 years as well?", "Thinking your video games matter vs your SO cooking you dinner is childlike.\n\nIgnoring a potential fire hazard for 5 years is childlike.\n\nI play video games, but I am under no illusion where that is in the pecking order.  I also am under no illusion that crying about his video game time being messed up is EXTREMELY unattractive.  It makes his girlfriend view him as a child, which is NOT sexy or romantic.\n\nSo he can keep throwing video game related fits and be dumped.", "As a cishet woman married to a cishet man, I get where you are coming from, but you are doing *a lot* of projecting, in my opinion. \n\nHe never says he doesn't know how to cook and wants him to teach her. He says he cooks basic meals- I do too as a woman. I don't enjoy cooking, so I make meals that are very simple and utilize a stove, crockpot or microwave. To me, it's about eating and getting nutrients because I don't enjoy it. What OP tells us is that his girlfriend grew up with restaurant quality cooks and feels his food is too basic. In response, he suggested they do it *together* so he could learn how she likes things. You're correct that it is not her job to teach him how to cook; however, if she feels his food is too basic for her, it *is* her job to teach him what kinds of things she likes and what she doesn't consider to be \"basic\" if she wants him to contribute to cooking. She also has the option to cook for herself, and allow OP to make his own food. Nothing here suggests that OP expects the girlfriend to cook, clean, and be a maid. A lot of you are assuming that because it's a trope of people who play video games. And while that isn't okay, it's also not okay to assume that just because a gamer is in conflict with his partner he's a useless adult.\n\nAs to your last paragraph, something I had to unlearn being married is that just because someone is not working while I am working, doesn't mean they aren't working or contributing equally. For example, I like to get off work and get all of my chores done before relaxing for the rest of the evening. My husband prefers to get off work, relax for a bit (sometimes that includes video games) and then do  what he refers to as his \"second shift\" around the house. You don't own your partner's time. It is reasonable to expect them to contribute equally to domestic labor without you having to manage them. However, you don't get to dictate every second of their life by saying \"I'm cleaning now, so you should be too\". That's toxic as hell, sorry.", "If, every time you get in the car, your partner says, \"You suck, I'm going to drive,\" how good a driver are you going to be?  It's not necessarily your responsibility to tutor your partner, but just giving them a chance is a good thing.", ">\"Oh poor me, my gf used one of my 2 ovens that I have in my free house I was given and I had to stop playing my game for 5 minutes 2 times because I don't know how to get someone to fix my oven\" \n\nfunniest thing I've read this morning \ud83e\udd23", ">\"She won't let him\" lol imagine being told you're not allowed to cook food in your own house.\n\nYet if a man tells a woman she can't do something in their home it's abuse, right? \n\nThe double standards on this thread absolutely blow me away sometimes. I agree, they both sound privileged as hell. She *has* to use the oven that creates electrical problems because she needs restaurant quality food because she's a very special snowflake. Hell, growing up there were times I lived places that didn't even have an oven. At the end of the day it's just cookies and video games, neither are necessities. They need to be respectful of each other and find a solution together.", "Sustenance for your body ? Nah. Baking is still just a hobby. Y'all are just mad because it's a dude playing video games and you deem his hobby inferior. But both are just what they are : hobbies.", "Did he say he expects her to clean it up? No. I am also messy while cooking. Cooking and baking is often messy. Who cares as long as he cleans it? You guys are projecting the standard online \"lazy man plays video games and gets angry while poor wife has to cook and clean and be a slave\" narrative when we don't know that to be true. Stop projecting and *read* what's been provided.", "If it's tripping the breaker that means it's overloading the circuit and every time that weakens the breaker. Get an electrician out to assess and redistribute the load. You've let this go for 5 years in a home you don't pay a mortgage on. Part of home ownership is maintenance. Take care of issues before they spiral and become more costly.  I think YTA for letting this go so long.", "You were cooking for one person. She is doing all the cooking for two people. It makes perfect sense that she'd want/need to use the big oven. \n\nAnd you're sort of ignoring the elephant in the room which is that this is potentially a massive safety issue. You will regret not finding time to have an electrician over if your house burns down.", "If it was just you then that\u2019s fine.  But you live with someone who cares about cooking and wants to use her kitchen to the fullest extent. Also it\u2019s possible it\u2019s not the oven but the wiring. Again I will keep saying this. The oven could be wired wrong or there is a faulty wire or a bunch of things that isn\u2019t about replacing the oven. The oven could be fine and it\u2019s actually the wiring for the house. And something causing a house fire is a possibility here. And you can\u2019t not get an electrician if your gf wants to cook in the kitchen. This should be your priority.", "If your parents can hand you an entire house, you can figure out a way to keep it in working order without yelling at your gf for using it as intended.", "You play video games for hours and yet the reason you can\u2019t call an electrician is because you\u2019re working hours? Come on dude, you\u2019re not fooling anyone", "She was cooking for you two while you were gaming. End of story. YTA", "Yeah, the weaponised incompetence where she ends up doing all the cooking because she wants to eat something that isn\u2019t crap did stick out as another reason he\u2019s TA.\n\nFortunately it sounds like soon he\u2019ll have sorted out his situation - no longer will he have the problem of a girlfriend who cooks him restaurant quality food while he games. He can instead have no girlfriend, feed himself badly, and never have to remember to save his game again! When his house burns down because of the electrical fault he can\u2019t be bothered fixing, then he might be sad to discover he doesn\u2019t have cloud backups from never saving, but hey, better than having to save your game or do something else around dinnertime or fix your major electrical safety problems.", "You mentioned that it had been weeks since you saved your game. You should have been more proactive. You never know when there may be an issue, whether with the game itself, power, etc. Fix the big oven as others have said, but also apologize to your girlfriend. It sounds like cooking is her hobby.", "Buddy, I kind of think she was frustrated because you came over from doing nothing to complain about how her making dinner for both of you interrupted your video game instead of just fixing the house your parents handed you.", "I spend a lot of time playing video games.\n\nI can totally acknowledge that they are stupid games and that I could be doing vastly more productive things.", "When you're berating her over a game, the game does become stupid, you can't change anyone's mind. Hurting a REAL person's feelings over a FICTIONAL game, makes it a stupid thing. And this is coming from someone who has over 1,000 hours on each of my switches. You're not taking control of fixing the problem and instead living with something that can be a hazard for the two of you, and getting mad at her for a hazard you refuse to fix. Get your head out of your ass. YTA in every way.", "You can't take a couple hours away from your game to call them?", "Yeah, YTA. You\u2019ve been inconveniencing her for absolutely ages because you\u2019re too lazy and cheap to fix a serious safety problem. You expect all the inconvenience of the problem to be borne by the person who is cooking for you; when the problem you couldn\u2019t be bothered to fix inconveniences *you*, suddenly you\u2019re dumping that on her too?\n\nYour game isn\u2019t being interrupted because of your girlfriend. Your game is being interrupted *because you aren\u2019t fixing an electrical problem in your house*. Take all the energy you\u2019re spending on your computer games; and on policing her day to day activities by making her report on when exactly she\u2019s going to do you the favour of making you better food than you can make yourself; and on this strop you\u2019ve thrown; and use it to *fix the problem with your house*.\n\nEvery single step of your behaviour has been unreasonable. That she finally snapped is no surprise at all. Complaining that your girlfriend is baking restaurant quality cookies for you and it disrupts your game because of the power fault you don\u2019t want to fix. Incredible.", "I think she sounds like someone at their wits end. I know I would be so over someone prioritizing playing video games over my ability to cook shared meals and food for the house or even just be over the situation of having the electricity be broken and my partner more concerned with if a game is saved properly. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean this to belittle your video games. I also like video games but at the end of the day you had this massive blow up fight where you left and it was all avoidable. I would be pissed if I was her because it\u2019s not like you both moved into a new space and it\u2019s a problem you inherited together. It\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a problem you brought forward into the living situation and this was something that should have been fixed years ago. Now of course it doesn\u2019t do well to dwell but I understand why she is so frustrated right now.\n\nAlso as a side note is there any way you can remote for half the day or even take a partial day to meet an electrician?", "I am a heavy gamer and I would have said the same. My partner is a heavy gamer and would have done the same. Real life comes first.", "When it comes to the health and safety of your home, you MAKE time. Heck, I just had a couple of lightbulbs flicker and shut off. It was over the weekend but you bet your ass that at 9 am Monday I was making calls to find someone, just to make sure the wiring is not bad. I would rather make time for an electrician than make time for the fire department and insurance adjusters!", "Again, none of this matters", "Lol, did we read the same post? \n\n> He can\u2019t have discussions about hard topics\nHe runs away instead of talking calmly\n\nOp tried to have a discussion. Gf told him off and dismissed his feelings.\n\n> He can\u2019t take responsibility for his own actions\nHe doesn\u2019t learn from his mistakes\n\nIt seems to me the gf can\u2019t take responsibility for her actions. She knows the problem with the oven, she knows he\u2019s asked for a heads up, yet she isn\u2019t capable of a simple task. Not to mention that she\u2019s cooking for two, why the hell can\u2019t she just use the working oven?", "How is this not read more!!! Perfect. Answer.", "This makes sense. I agree. I still think there is some merit to what I said. But I think this is a very valid interpretation and representation of what Op has described.", "Oh, someone with a sense of humour. How nice \ud83d\ude05", "She has lived there for 2 months. It is his house. I can't imagine letting someone move into my home and start dictating what I can and can't do in my kitchen.", "Lol no. I'm a gamer too, so is my partner. I also bake. I know which one we both deem more important.", "This. The comments are driving me crazy. He proposed to share the cooking duty several times or even cook with her, she refused, that's on her. She can't complain that she is the one cooking when she refuses to do otherwise.\n\nI am also very messy when I cook and bake. When I was a teen it used to drive my mom crazy. So what I did is just do it when she wasn't there to see the disaster and do a thorough clean up once it's done/in the oven. Sometimes I didn't clean up well enough, but telling me was enough, and I learnt to get better at it. Restraining him access to the cooking gear is an asshole move in and on itself.\n\nAlthough they should def get the oven fixed lmfao.", "I need to upvote this more. Unplug the big oven until it can be prioritized, and since gf if Chef Dujour in the kitchen...PRIORITIZE IT.", "None of this is a valid reason for her to not warn him which is the actual issue here, not the one you are making up.", "She's making cookies and insisted on cooking because she doesn't like the way he does it. She ain't doing him a favor.", "You are making a lot of assumptions here. If you go to OPs comments, he says he makes a mess, but always cleans up before he actually eats. Seems fine to me. \n\nWe don't have any examples of the basic meals he makes, but I would assume things like spaghetti. He's used to eating by himself and to his own standards. She wants a higher standard, so she is welcome to cook for herself.", "He obviously never played the sims if he isn't panic saving every 15 mins lololol", "Lol same here, I'm a girl too (well I'm in my thirties but yeah...) I spend a stupid amount of time gaming, even when other things should be getting done. I'd never yell at my spouse like this over my game and when the house burns down the guy is really going to regret not calling the electrician. Out of hours is expensive, sure, but buying a new home far more so...", "It does though??? This situation literally would not have happened in any capacity if he had fixed the oven lmao", "It does though. He\u2019s asking her to either not have access to use of their shared kitchen or tell him every time she uses the oven. The solution isn\u2019t her being disrespectful and needs to be knocked down a peg. I would argue the same would apply to him because the oven is potentially a hazard situation and she is also entitled to have a baking hobby. \n\nThe solution is fixing the oven. And that\u2019s what\u2019s relevant. He doesn\u2019t feel the need to call the electrician and doesn\u2019t have it as a high priority.", "I do see your point as well. That is something that happens. I know I have experienced it in the past. I just feel a little bad for OP because a lot of assumptions are being made by a lot of commenters. Although I only feel a little bad because they need to fix the damn oven before an electrical fire breaks out.", "Idk. We don't know if she's contributing financially or not, if she's paying bills it's her space too. I personally would have set the boundary of do not use the second oven at all (since they refuse to fix it for some unknown reason) because if an electrical fire breaks out OP is on the hook for that and any damage, not the girlfriend.", "Yeah. That's the opinion of you and your partner. But objectively, both are just hobbies and there should be no hierarchy between the two.", "Reddit is filled with double standards.. Mostly against men it seems and jealous women. If you fall outside of that you are safe.", "I don't know if you're suggesting I'm making up that cooking for two people requires more than a toaster oven, or that an appliance regularly tripping the fuse is potentially dangerous. But I will admit some bias against an adult who plays video games every night while his girlfriend cooks their dinner. It's not like it should be a surprise to him that cooking often requires the oven, and she cooks before he eats. I would gently suggest he could just find a different time to play video games, and set the table/clean the house/clean up as she cooks. I would go out on a limb and guess that the reason she got annoyed at him asking is because she's annoyed that he plays video games every night while she cooks them dinner.", "This is AITA not \"would it have happened\"", "He also said he did call an electrician, so\n\nEdit: wrong, my bad", "That is the solution but the post is in AITA not in \"give me a solution\". For the matter at hand i disagree with you and asking the gf to tell him when she uses it is totally reasonable, it literally takes three seconds, so the issue here is her not respecting a reasonable request and not the oven.", "Agreed. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m lent into my interpretation. I\u2019m an architect and I would go scorched earth on this. 5 YEARS!!! She just moved in and he doesn\u2019t see this potentially hazardous situation as top priority!?!", "Either way, instead of focusing on their hobbies, maybe they should get their oven fixed \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If you read the post he offered to help with cooking she refused his help so she is the AH here it's not at all hard to let him know that she is going to turn of the power to his computer your bias is disgusting there is nothing wrong with playing videogames regardless of age", "Or he could just start saving the game?\n\n\nHe did say that the reason he wanted her to warn him when using the oven is for him to save the game then. Why not just save it already?", "I mean it was obvious that anyone that thinks that op is in any shape or form an ah has a personal bias, you really didn't need to say it, for me. \n\nI will simply repeat myself again: this is not what the post is about. The oven is just a facade.", "1. Where does he say this?\n\n2. Clearly not a good one because your oven should not trigger the breaker.", "He said he was putting off calling the electrician for a couple more weeks, but might expedite the process now that it's become a point of conflict.", "My husband plays videogames and I don't mind at all - because he does it after dinner, and after the house is picked up and ready to go for the next day. And he cooks about half the time.\n\nThis sentence: \"I once suggested that we could cook together sometimes so I could improve but she doesn't want because she finds me too messy in the kitchen..\" does not, to me, suggest a good faith effort at pulling half his weight in the work of getting food on the table. And she's not wrong- cooking dinner IS more important that playing video games.\n\nThey are both in their early twenties, two months into cohabiting with a partner for the first time - this is normal shit they're working through. But I would imagine if OP did a inventory of whether he is taking on an equal share of the chores around the house, he might come up with a bit of an answer as to why his girlfriend is so pissed.", "I mean there are a lot of things he could do differently to solve this VERY PREDICTABLE problem. Saving his game more frequently, a UPS, fixing his oven, playing video games at a different time of day, learning to cook (on his own time, not making his girlfriend tutor him and making a huge mess while cooking dinner). Instead he has insisted on playing unsaved video games, right before dinner, in a house with faulty wiring.", "I misread, he didn't. F me he doesn't help my case does he. \n\nOf course that shouldnt happen, yes. I still think this is beside the real issue tho.", "Yeah i misread"]}
