This is my parents' old second home, my parents gave it to me when I moved out of the family home 5 years ago. Helen and I are very happy with this house because it is comfortable and well located.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is just a little problem with the kitchen, there are two ovens, one big and one smaller. The small one works well but sometimes the big one cuts off the power when it switches off (you just have to turn the power back on the meter). It is not everytime, maybe once in five times but to avoid that, I always use the small oven which was more than enough when I was living alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Helen moved in, at first we took turns cooking but she quicky insisted to manage the cooking alone, she thinks my cooking is a bit too basic. Her parents own a restaurant so I guess she has higher standards and she cooks better than me tbf.. I once suggested that we could cook together sometimes so I could improve but she doesn't want because she finds me too messy in the kitchen..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI warned her about the big oven and to prioritize the smaller one or to let me know before using the big one. I like to play Football Manager on my PC before dinner and it would be a shame to have a power cut at this moment. If she tells me beforehand, I can save my game in case of a cut\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 weeks ago Helen used the big oven without telling me and the power went out, while I was playing. I gently remembered her to warn next time and it's ok, I had saved a few minutes before, and everyone can forget or mess up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday she wanted to make cookies and used the big oven again without telling me, I was playing, and I hadn't saved for several in-game weeks (stupid, I know) so it was lost. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was annoyed and I asked why she didn't warn me. Instead of apologising she said aggresively to get over it, that I shouldn't get upset about that stupid game, after all cooking the dinner was much more important. I got angry and answered that she shouldn't disrespect my hobbies like that and she could just enjoy her so much important dinner alone and I stormed off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to visit a friend (24M) to vent, and I ended up sleeping there (I told my gf by message that I will sleep there and it's best to talk tomorrow). My friend thinks that Helen messed up and is in the wrong but this morning, I received a text from a friend a Helen calling me a huge asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reflecting about it, I start to feel bad, maybe I did overreact or was completly in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA\u00a0?", "created_utc": 1681907298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rrl6i/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_gf_after_she_turned/", "score": 3303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or have the electrical problem fixed?  Or get rid of the big oven so she can't use it?   I think storming out and spending the night at your friends is an overreaction.

You should get it checked out ASAP.", "Here\u2019s my issue with this post. Instead of fixing the electrical and breaker box you are now asking for your gf to either tell you every time she wants to cook or use an oven that is too small for the task at hand. Then you yelled at her for it. And while I do think she came in a bit hot in her defense, you are claiming she doesn\u2019t respect your hobbies because she is cooking you dinner and providing food in the house. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m between E S h and Y T A. \n\nInfo: has there been any effort to fix the electricity? Was it just asking or did you accuse her of ruining your hobbies/day/game? Has she in the past asked for money to be allocated to fixing the oven issue, or are both of you just living with this issue and mismanaging funds?\n\nBecause if you are refusing to work with her fix the issue and allocate the funds and are blaming her for cooking when you want to play your game then your the problem. \n\nIf neither of you have worked out a solution and are just at each others throats over this issue then both of you suck. \n\nBut something tells me that there\u2019s more going on here. Especially because of how you describe her being \u201cfed up\u201d with you trying to cook and being messy in the kitchen. Personally when I see that it makes my brain go to weaponized incompetence. Maybe I\u2019m wrong there but my spidey senses are tingling.\n\nEdit: ive thought about it. YTA. You haven\u2019t made efforts to get it fixed and are blaming her for using an appliance in her own home.

You still overreacted but FM makes you do that.", "YTA for knowing about this problem for ages and not fixing it. This is an electrical problem. That is the sort of thing that causes fires. The reason I am so firm in this vote is because THREE different sets of cousins living thousands of miles apart have had fires from very similar causes. One lost her whole house.

Apologise to your girl and get the damn electrician to fix the problem.", "You are both in the wrong.\n\nFirstly, you asked her to simply warn you when she needed to use the big oven. I don\u2019t see why she finds that so difficult? \n\nI also find it frustrating when people think gaming as a hobby is stupid. It\u2019s something you like to do and she should respect that, it\u2019s no different from doing anything else as a hobby.\n\nLastly, you could have also prevented this argument. You know there is an issue with the big cooker. If it keeps on tripping the electrics that is usually a sign that there is something wrong with it.

When she\u2019s cooking not just for you but the whole family? Or even when she just has her friends over and needs the big oven? What then? She has to use it then. Are you going to complain every time the power trips? Just get the stupid thing fixed!!!", "YTA. She's in the kitchen making your dinner while you game, and you're angry that she forgot to ask your permission? That's not reasonable, you overreacted.

Instead of playing games, maybe update the oven or the house so it doesn't do that.   If it is faulty wiring the house could burn down.   If I was her I would refuse to cook until you fixed the problem.   I mean you are complaining about playing a game while she is cooking and doing adult things.", "ESH\n\nShe forgot to warn you, but you yourself didn't think about saving your game for in-game weeks. So both are to blame. And both are now fighting in stead of owning up to your own oversights.", "YTA - there's something seriously wrong with the wiring in your home if the breaker is tripping. Hire an electrician or keep risking fire.  Also, instead of playing games while your GF is making your food, help her or socialize with her.", "YTA.

If you know it's that big of a deal, replace the oven or get an electrician.", "Using an appliance should not trip a breaker repeatedly. It means either the appliance is pulling too much load or there is a weak breaker. It should be easy enough for any electrician to diagnose and if it's just a weak breaker should be a cheap enough fix. Replacing the oven or rewiring wouldn't be, but also shouldn't continue to be used for safety reasons.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nWho cares about your stupid game ? You should get someone to look at what's wrong with the fucking oven instead of acting like a child. \n\nI guess that's what happens when mommy and daddy give you a house for free....", "NTA\n\nWhile the issue is trivial, it does show her incompetency to warn you about something she\u2019ll do, which could have greater effects", "NTA, but sorry to tell you OP, you won't win here. You have committed two cardinal reddit sins- being a man in a conflict with his female partner, and enjoying video games. \n\nI'm married to a man who plays games and as long as you aren't toxic and throwing tantrums when you lose progress, it's okay to be disappointed. I'm a reader and got locked out of my goodreads account and had to start over and was a little sad. Her telling you to \"get over it\" was not cool. That's not how you respond when your partner is upset and being reasonable. It's reasonable to ask for a warning. I do think spending the night with a friend was dramatic. I get leaving to think and calm down for a bit but all night?\n\nSince she doesn't respect your hobby (it took me some time too, I won't lie) it's probably in your best interest to look into getting the oven fixed. Not to mention it seems like an electrical issue and you don't want an electrical fire. I hope once you both calm down you can work it out. You both overreacted a bit.", "ESH - you go whining off to a friends house after that tiny disagreement?

Right after that you should fix the oven.", "As a gamer, household cook, and a homeowner I'm going with YTA.\n\nYeah it's annoying that your gaming was interrupted but come on, you know the root cause of this and you're to lazy to fix or replace the equipment and the constant flipping of the switch is going to cause the breaker to fail with the constant surges putting your house at risk.\n\nPlus she's nice enough to cook for both of you providing better food and she's continued to work with shitty equipment and as the better cook myself in my marriage, I cannot stand using the smaller oven because the heat source is to close and causes uneven baking.\n\nFix or replace the faulty appliance man.", "So here\u2019s what I read from this:\n\nMy gf does this daily chore that benefits both of us.

She is still doing you a service by cooking for you, and I also know that often times gamers (myself included) get really into what they're doing, so as simple as it sounds to just tell someone beforehand, there is a chance you won't be focused on what is being said.

Gaming is fine, but other hobbies are good too, especially ones where you get out of the house and move around. Lastly, get the oven fixed. There is no good reason to have faulty wiring in your house, that is dangerous.

That has no bearing here other than that he owns it now and is responsible for fixing things (which most people, including me, have already stated needs to be fixed). \n\nDid OP mess up by not saving? Yes. Should OP fix his oven? Yes. Does OP get upset when Helen uses the oven and does let him know?

He says he cooks basic meals- I do too as a woman. I don't enjoy cooking, so I make meals that are very simple and utilize a stove, crockpot or microwave. To me, it's about eating and getting nutrients because I don't enjoy it. What OP tells us is that his girlfriend grew up with restaurant quality cooks and feels his food is too basic. In response, he suggested they do it *together* so he could learn how she likes things. You're correct that it is not her job to teach him how to cook; however, if she feels his food is too basic for her, it *is* her job to teach him what kinds of things she likes and what she doesn't consider to be \"basic\" if she wants him to contribute to cooking. She also has the option to cook for herself, and allow OP to make his own food. Nothing here suggests that OP expects the girlfriend to cook, clean, and be a maid. A lot of you are assuming that because it's a trope of people who play video games. And while that isn't okay, it's also not okay to assume that just because a gamer is in conflict with his partner he's a useless adult.\n\nAs to your last paragraph, something I had to unlearn being married is that just because someone is not working while I am working, doesn't mean they aren't working or contributing equally. For example, I like to get off work and get all of my chores done before relaxing for the rest of the evening. My husband prefers to get off work, relax for a bit (sometimes that includes video games) and then do  what he refers to as his \"second shift\" around the house. You don't own your partner's time.

Why does your girlfriend have to warn you about using the stove when you could just realize she's going to make dinner so she's going to cook. I guarantee you that your game has a far lower priority to her than your computer game, that you play alone, instead of spending time with her. She's making dinner for both of you. \n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the fire hazard you're completely ignoring, but I think enough other people have thoroughly covered. \n\nIf I were your girlfriend, I'd stop making dinner for you completely and let you figure it out. \"Sorry, I can only cook for one on this small stove.\"", "YTA.

Yes she could use the smaller oven but I\u2019m imagining like a small countertop portable oven and that\u2019s too small to make meals without having to cook each thing one at a time and having the food cool before the meal is done.  2) Also you KNOW the oven throws the breaker, so find any other to play like AFTER dinner.  3) Also your hobby isn\u2019t as important as food which is an actual necessity, so she wasn\u2019t disrespecting your hobby by calling out that food is in fact more important than a video game.\nEdit to add: she is literally feeding you while you play video games and your mad.  She\u2019s doing a chore while you play, your game is not nearly as important.", "OP - shes cooking - oven might be used.   Save your game.   She shouldnt have to tell you shit.  \n\nPS - shes cooking your meals while you play a game.   Sounds like mom and 15 year old   Get up and go have a conversation with her.

Yes, she's the AH for disregarding your wishes and your hobbie. But YTA for risking both your lives because you are to cheap to repair the oven. You're a homeowner now and MAINTENANCE is something you need to take seriously. The reason the power is going out is that there is a short in the oven power supple somewhere, which, if left unrepaired could CAUSE A FIRE!! I would immediately kill the power and disconnect the power from the oven. That will solve your problem immediately, but not the problem of you not recognizing that as a homeowner you need to keep your home in good repair at least to the point it doesn't kill you in your sleep some night.\n\nAs to the GF, she should be paying rent. You could use that money for home upkeep and fix the oven. Her cooking dinners each night is not equivalent to rent. But, recognize the having her cook for you is an extremely rare bonus, especially considering you get to game while she cooks.", "Why dont you just remove the oven? Or leave a physical note saying do not use?", "ESH. Why haven\u2019t you fixed the oven? There\u2019s clearly an issue with the wiring or switch. This can be dangerous if left unchecked. You\u2019re a homeowner now OP. You need to be proactive about these things. The last thing you want is your house burning down or oven blowing up and injuring/killing someone. Let\u2019s be honest, not saving your game and the power going out really isn\u2019t all that bad considering what could happen. Your gf knows that the oven is faulty so shouldn\u2019t be using it. You\u2019re both at fault here.", "INFO \nDepends on what is considered basic.\n\nIf basic is spaghetti/ rice and chicken/ maybe burgers or tacos or something, then no.\n\nIf basic is small toaster oven baked tater tots and frozen burritos then yes YWBTA via weaponized incompetence. \n\nI think this is a perception issue on the part of ambiguity. Some people reading this see small oven and basic meals and see a single guy cooking up casseroles in a small kitchen oven while also having a second industrial grade oven in his kitchen. Others see it as a guy with a normal kitchen with a faulty normal oven that insists on not solving the electrical issue with his normal oven because the small toaster oven served his purposes just fine.\n\nI think more information is required on this one for us to make a real judgment", "Why are you playing during dinner prep?

That would be a deal breaker for me! He can tell his friends whatever (within reason) about our fight to vent or to get input, he doesn't get to quote their opinion to me as gospel and they better pretend they know nothing about it just as my friends do.\n\nI understand the urge to interfere when your friend is hurt, but that should be nipped in the bud the first time and never ever happen again.\n\nOP massively overreacted too...

She has literally told him that his cooking isn't good enough (for her) to eat, that he's too messy to help her in any way, that no, she doesn't want to teach him how to cook better, and that she'll be the one making the meals from now on.   \n\nSHE banished HIM from the kitchen so she doesn't get to be mad if he finds something else to do...", "Fixing the electrical issue is an ESH, but at least OP uses the small one more than his girlfriend does.\n\n\"Save your game\" isn't that simple, and its a big point of the post. All he wanted was a warning so that he knew how often to save it. Sometimes it's easy to forget to save when you get in the zone, hence why he wanted the warning.\n\nHe can complain, he has the right to do so. He wanted to cook sometimes, his GF said no because it's too basic. He wanted to learn how to cook and cook with his GF, he was told no because he's too messy. So he relinquished the cooking to her, and since he can't cook like he wanted to he goes to play his game. His one request was that if he can't cook, that he at least wanted a warning when the big stove got used, and that's not that much to ask for.\n\nShould he have stormed off? Maybe not. But if he is being honest, then he came to her with a reasonable complaint and just wanted a warning, and in response his GF made fun of his hobby and told him that it didn't matter how much time he just wasted cause it was a waste anyway. That is hurtful, and when someone close to OP insults him for trying to have a conversation, I think it is perfectly reasonable to remove himself from the situation and gather his thoughts independently. \n\nHe probably should ask her if she is upset that he games while she \"does chores\", but let's not pretend like OP didn't offer to do the exact \"chores\" that she is doing and she refused.", "> You should also ask if she's upset that you are gaming while she's doing chores and work out that issue.\n\nThat, with the extra layer that OP is essentially a slumlord, telling a tenant they can\u2019t use their home in the way homes are generally used because he\u2019s too cheap and lazy to maintain a useable kitchen.

Of course there could be more to the story and he is egregiously incompetent or purposefully disrupting things to get her to not want him to help, but why assume that with no reason to believe it? If the gf is cooking, asking for a simple warning about her using the big oven is not too much. And her dismissing him being upset is mean, I am a big gamer and if my bf made a mistake that made me lose progress, he would be sorry and compassionate, because he cares about the things I enioy. Based off what OP says, he doesn't seem to be getting toxic when the situations come up, it's the gf he gets toxic first. I say NTA, unless there is information OP is keeping from us. And if the gf is resentful to OP for not helping with dinner, she needs to grow up and communicate that, rather than say \"it's fine I'll do it all myself\" and then sabotage his hobbies out of anger.", "I really don't get everybody saying stuff like \"you have no right to complain you're gaming while she's cooking you food!!!!!!!!!!\" \n  \n?  \n  \nThe couple has established that the GF should be the one who cooks.

Instead of solving the problem, she instantly got into attacking mode and now the comment section destroys him for not getting an electrition. that is not the point. sure that would be the smart thing to do, but he is not the asshole for that... they are both living there now and as he said... the other oven works fine.", "This comment section is fucking UNBELIEVABLE.

That being said obviously there is a cause for concern with the large oven and op should for sure have it looked at and fixed and he shouldn't have stormed off.

As a woman who was treated with this manner of disdain by a spouse I would never again tolerate this level of disrespect, not would I allow my partner to be aggressive in lieu of effective and appropriate communication.\n\nOP has his own flaws here, but OP is NTA.", "NTA\n\nSounds to me like you are annoyed at her not apologising far more than her ruining your game.  and you have every right to be annoyed.  \n\nSounds like your missus is a dick.  its fair enough to make the mistake and use the wrong oven, but to dismiss your game as unimportant is just wrong.   its really easy for her to say sorry.\n\nbut maybe think about getting the oven fixed.", "> blaming her for using an appliance in her own home.\n\nBut its *not* her home, its OP's home.

Some of the comments on here are wild. I lean ESH because leaving was excessive but I think she's the bigger asshole. \n\nWhen I first read it, I thought it was one double oven when he described the smaller/larger oven setup, which would be iffy to not have fixed after so long. In a comment he explained it's a standard range and a double oven, so it seems like it would've been a rare problem before the girlfriend  since it only sporadically trips the breaker. As an avid cook and baker, I think it's pretty crazy she's using the larger oven so often. My grandmother had a similar setup and the only time we ever used the larger oven was on holidays/large gatherings where multiple casseroles and dishes were going at once. \n\nHe tried to fix it himself and ran into a wall, it's not like he just threw his hands up and did nothing this entire time. Also, he's young so he may not know that it's a potential fire hazard (I'm older and had a water heater start tripping a breaker. If it wasn't the middle of winter, I probably would've put it off too to avoid after hour rates. I didn't think about it being a fire hazard until the handyman showed me where the short was), so I don't think he's TA for not fixing the oven.", "I don't think OP overreacted.

If fixing the faulty one is not an option for now, then removing it sounds like a possible solution - however since he mentioned that the oven works 4/5 of the time with no problems - it again boils down to the warning/ habit.\n (I understand comparing him to a kid is not the best way to get the point across. But some people, (me included) were not taught or forced to develop good cooking skills so in a way some people are at a child's level when it comes to cooking) \nAlso I feel like she had no actual need to use the bigger faulty oven for baking some cookies. A big dinner,sure. But cookies? \n\nNext for everyone dismissing how she refuses to teach him. This is a red flag to me. Why, if you have higher demand on certain skills, do you get angry at someone for not being efficient enough at the skill? What if they decide to have children together in the future? Would she bail on teaching them how to get better at things too? Especially when it comes to cooking.
