She hasn\u2019t ever truly been in a serious relationship. A lot of us have, frankly, chalked it up to jealousy. \n\nI\u2019m pregnant now, finally. My husband and I struggled with infertility for over two years. I am in my second trimester. \n\nI got together with Kate and a few other friends the other day.

You guys know that kid in high school who would brag he had 472882 shots of tequila followed by even more shots of vodka the night before, and you knew there was no way? That\u2019s kind of Kate.

My response was completely justified, and now I'm a little hurt, to be honest, that your text isn't asking if I am okay, not acknowledging how poorly Kate behaved, and centering Kate's feelings while ignoring my own.\"\n\nKate needs to be cut out. Coke, alcohol, living with the parents, partying, who cares. I have no judgment for Kate on her life, her plans, or her lifestyle. But you do not need people in your life who pick at you and put you down, and also create tornadoes of drama wherever they go, and that is exactly what Kate did here. She was mean for no reason, you matched her energy, now you have a friend texting you, you are writing on reddit about it, you probably are thinking about it a lot, etc. And you don't need that kind of energy in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a smart guy. You should marry him.", "My response would be, \u2018I\u2019ll apologise for calling her a coked out loser when she apologises for suggesting that I\u2019ll be such a shit Mom I should abort my very-much loved and wanted baby.\u2019\n\nThen let silence reign. Put your phone on mute for 24 hours and go do something nice with your awesome hubby.", "NTA, I would also cut ties with her. It's hard to be friends with someone when they just won't keep their opinions to themselves.", "NTA. Do you care she was \"very hurt\"? Wasn't what she said very hurtful? Why are your \"friends\" asking that you apologize for your comment, but not asking Cokey McGee to apologize too?", "NTA - why do people feel the need to comment on other peoples' parenting skills before the baby is even born? Sounds like she's jealous and was trying to take away some of your happiness.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I would have called her worse. \n\nIgnoring everything she might be (jealous etc), her comments about you as a mother and taking care of the baby were not acceptable and incredibly hurtful. Has she reached out to apologize? Are your friends who say she is hurt asking her to apologize to you?\n\nIt maybe time to consider what you get from this friendship these days, and if it's only situations like this, then it's okay to let the friendship end. Friends for life rarely happen, and most friendships end without a bang. And that's okay!! \n\nFocus on your baby and husband and life and just walk away from this all. Apologize if it will make you feel better, forgive her and yourself, and walk away from friends like that.", "NTA. It sounds like you outgrew this friendship years ago.

Nah. \n\nI second hubby\u2019s recommendation of cutting her out completely. She\u2019s obviously one of those friends that\u2019s you\u2019re only seeing because you\u2019ve been friends for too long and there wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to stop being friends. Now you have a good enough reason.", "NTA. Her comments  were out of line and completely unsolicited. I\u2019m sure Kate needs help and addiction issues are no joke, but what she said to you was catty and downright toxic, and you don\u2019t need that kind of vibe around you or your family. If you feel too bad, send her a text or a letter, apologize for what you said and explain how what SHE said was way out of line\u2026 then tell her you wish her well and, as your hubby suggested, say goodbye to her. \n\nEDIT: Also, I would question why that \u201cfriend\u201d texted you defending Kate and making her look like a victim but not at ALL asking about you or showing any support for you after what Kate said.", "NTA.  She's jealous, so lashing out at you.  Coke heads will say some seriously stupid shit.  I say this having been there/done that in my youth.", "NTA\nWhat you said was rude but Kate was also very rude. Why does she feel the need to berate you on certain things and potentially others? Like you said probably because she is jealous.

I would NEVER say something like this to a pregnant friend. Kate *is* a coked out loser. Who the fuck would say something like that to you? Honestly I think you should cut her out.

I'm getting married this weekend and one of my bridesmaids has been nasty and rude for no reason that I can determine.

You could always have spoken to her like the injured little girl she really is, and perhaps heard that she's miserable and knows she could not do today what you are doing. \n\nIf that's too much work, then absolving yourself of this relationship is also a perfectly good choice to make. Release it because you love her. But really release it because you love yourself enough to not want to be mean to someone else and incur that karma/guilt.", "NTA but WHY are you still friend with a \"coked out loser\"? She's obviously jealous of you but you don't need her in your life to potentially put you and your family at risk. Drug addicts are the worst kind of people to be around if you don't have to, they can only bring you misery and pain.", "NTA. And  I'm with your husband here - Kate is not your friend, despite what you seem to think.", "NTA.  She kept poking you for a response.  She got one.", "Definitely NTA.

Good luck!", "NTA and remember that \u201churt people hurt people\u201d. \n\nI do have some sympathy for Kate.

She is toxic.", "NTA at all. Save yourself some time and heart ache- cut her out of your life now. She sounds like trash who will take herself out. If you stop responding to her and feeding into her pity party bs, she'll move on to someone else who will. Good riddance. \n\nSpeaking as a mom, this is not someone you're going to want around your kids. You deserve better for yourself, of course, but your family does not need this toxic nonsense. \n\nYour husband sounds lovely. Congratulations on your future addition; it's a wild ride but a great one. Having a baby with a good partner will make you fall even more in love with them, because you get to see them be a great parent. \n\nThis friend belongs in the past. Leave her there.", "NTA. I wouldn't stay friends with anyone who regularly does coke for the simple fact that people on coke are just fucking annoying and shitty to be around. Besides, it sounds like you have other friends who don't need to put you down to build themselves up. Why even keep her around? Curate your social life.", "I\u2019m completely confused as to why you are friends or care to be friends with this person. She sounds awful. Tell your other friends you aren\u2019t going to apologize and you don\u2019t want any more contact with her. You have far more important things to be thinking about now (and surely you would not want her around your child if she\u2019s using drugs). Her living at home is irrelevant\u2026it\u2019s the drug use that is the problem. Just walk away. NTA", "Nope, NTA. Whether it's due to drugs or a lousy personality, Kate was very rude to you. You were wise to get out of that situation quickly. You owe her nothing.", "NTA, it\u2019s time to let go of that friendship, sounds toxic.

She sure can dish but folds like a dollar store lawn chair when the same energy is given back. \n\nI\u2019m with your hubby on this, OP. This seems like a chapter that\u2019s ready to be closed. You\u2019ve all outgrown Kate, and have incompatible lifestyles. And that\u2019s completely aside from the fact that what she said was absolutely horrid and she just sounds like an awful person to begin with. You\u2019ve all been enabling her BS for far too long in my opinion.", "NTA. And maybe that kid in high school was an alcoholic. You may have a high tolerance, be functional, etc. But you're still damaging your body if you carry on like that. Kate is using to hang out with people who don't use. She's an addict.", "NTA \n\nKate was very hurt by what you said\n\n*side eye* - good that was the point", "ESH.\nIt\u2019s probably better for y\u2019all to cut ties.", "Your husband's right.   She's toxic.", "oh my lord. Get better friends", "NTA, but do you want to keep Kate in your life as a friend? If the answer is no, then by all means don't apologize. Goodbye to bad rubbish. Buuut..., if you want to keep her as a friend, you should apologize. I'm not usually a fan of apologizing and then offering the reason for the bad behavior, because you're not really sorry then are you. You'd be justifying your hurtful outburst. Lets just agree that you both hurt each other.\n\nI read her highly offensive and inappropriate words as an outward expression of her own inward fears. It's like Donald Trump. Whatever accusation comes out of his mouth is actually revealing something about himself. She in all certainty is worried about whether or not she'll have infertility issues from her cocaine history. That she'll be a bad mom, because she hasn't left her parents home. And lastly, maybe she had an abortion? Do you think it's possible she lost or aborted a pregnancy when a teen? It all feels like a stream of consciousness coming out and being afraid to acknowledge that she's talking about herself.", "I wish you nothing but the best. She needs to exit your life very quickly. I know you said you don't think she is addicted but if she can't be at a friendly dinner and not be high she has a problem. Sounds like she has many problems. She needs help soon. I would be scared for you to even be around her. O and those other friends need to get bent. Cut them out to because the last thing you need is them stressing you out over defending yourself.", "ESH. \n\nI wouldn't want to be friends with any of you. \n\nShe sounds awful, totally a car crash, and what she said to you was inexcusable, but judging people who would rather keep partying in their 30s than go for the \"marriage and babies\" thing is also kind of smug and not cool. \n\nWe don't all have to do that to be valid and not everyone who didn't choose that is \"jealous\".", "NTA tit for tat. Your friend was being an ass and you responded appropriately. You hurt her feelings? Boohoo for her she was being a massive ass and quite frankly I think if men could get pregnant and someone told me I\u2019ll be a better parent than you and saying all that extra shit I\u2019d probably sock em.

Get her out of your life.", "Absolutely NTA, your \u2018friend\u2019 sounds like a turd and FYI coke usually amplifies the underlying personality, so that stands if she was on drugs or not. SHE needs to apologise to YOU, 100%", "Why are you friends with this person? What do you get out of the relationship? Is it a relationship of habit and history or an adult friendship?\n\nA drug-fueled partier with a failure to launch problem is not a good friend to have when you are about to become a mother. She\u2019ll be on coke around your kid. It\u2019s your responsibility to prevent that.", "NTA. Your 'friend' who knows you struggled to get pregnant, essentially told you to abort your (very much wanted) child because she thinks you won't be a good mom, and you're the bad guy? Yikes, hope you stop hanging out with Kate, she sounds incredibly toxic", "You don\u2019t need to defend her. Nothing she said was acceptable.", "NTA. Your husband is right you should just cut her out of your life. Her jealousy is beyond toxic at this point and you don't need this kind of stress when you're pregnant.", "NTA.\nAs the saying goes, the truth hurts. Your 'friend' shouldn't be handing out barbs if she can't handle a few home truths in return. \nIf she can say something so foul to an expectant mother who struggled to get there, she is not someone you want in your life. She doesn't deserve you, or to be around your baby. \n\nShe is right about one thing though.\nYou do have options.\nYou have the option to throw this loser out of your life so she can no longer use her very obvious jealousy towards other people's happiness as a stick to beat people with.\nLet her go.

Kate basically encouraged a woman who struggled for years to get pregnant, in her second trimester, to get an abortion.\n\nAnd your friends were upset with YOU? \n\nKate has some serious issues. You don\u2019t know if anything happened to her as a child, perhaps. There\u2019s often a reason why people become self destructive and chase the escape of drugs. As for whether she\u2019s addicted\u2026She showed up probably high, acting erratic, at a small get together where no one else was using. This indicates that she felt the need for drugs to get through a social interaction. She also has a history of doing drugs/partying with people much younger than her, like she\u2019s determined to remain immature. She\u2019s got a problem.\n\nIf she wants kids, she\u2019s blowing the very limited time she has left. She hasn\u2019t even started on sobriety. She\u2019s acting erratic. OBs label women \u201cgeriatric\u201d at age 35. That\u2019s when you get prescribed additional tests and ultrasounds while pregnant. It is so sad to see that she still doesn\u2019t have her act together. \n\nPerhaps your boundary will need to be that she\u2019s got to be sober around you. Please don\u2019t ever let her babysit your child, unless she becomes stable and sober. \n\nNTA. There is not much lower assholery can go beyond suggesting a pregnant woman who spent years trying to get pregnant would not make a good mother and should consider getting an abortion or giving the baby up, which are the only two options there are.", "NTA.

I\u2019d consider what benefit you gain by beings friends with her AND the person that suggested you apologize. Do they contribute good to your life? And is that good worth the clear display of disrespect she shows you as a future mother? \n\nAlso fyi, demanding apologies over a reaction to the shitty thing she did/said is a common tactic seen in abusers. Do a little research into DARVO. Your husbands smart for suggesting you cut off contact. With the road your \u2018friend\u2019 is headed down, she\u2019ll statistically likely hold you back and bring you down. Is this a person you want around your kids?

Who the fuck would say something like that to you? Honestly I think you should cut her out. You don't want someone like that around your kids anyway.", "Honestly I think you should cut her out. You don't want someone like that around your kids anyway. Most of my older sisters friends like that offered me drugs like blow and crack when I reached age fourteen.", "NTA. \n\nKate is projecting.

Thank you.", "I second this- your friend isn\u2019t married with kids, therefore she is a jealous loser? Your post reeks of judgement, you basically just invalidated her life.\n\nSingle women are very aware of this kind of judgement, trust me she\u2019ll have picked up on it too and this might have been her breaking point. \n\nYou were very comfortable criticising her life choices but when she questions yours, she\u2019s a monster? \n \nBTA", "I do like her, yes.", "But weren't Kate's comments also targeted and intended to hurt? I find it impossible to believe that Kate's attack was anything other than intentional cruelty... no one's that oblivious.\n\nI kind of take issue with the idea that defending yourself against an attack somehow makes you as culpable as the attacker. I suppose you could make the point that OP could have simply defended herself (\"I think I *am* ready for kids, and here's why\"), but I get the feeling that would've just prompted Kate to attack more. \n\nSometimes when someone's being aggressive with you, you need to be aggressive back in order to make them stand down. Even the law acknowledges this reality by not charging the victims of assault for fighting back in equal measure if they believe the attack will continue.\n\nSo yeah, I absolutely don't think OP owes Kate an apology. I guess she might give one if she hopes to maintain a friendship with Kate, but I'm not sure why she'd want to.", "Being an addict doesn't give you the right to treat people like shit and say hurtful things to them.
