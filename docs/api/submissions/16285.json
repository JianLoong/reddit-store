We\u2019ve been friends since high school, though we\u2019re not as close anymore - different interests, different places in life. \n\nKate has never left her parents house. She works a lot, and parties even more - she\u2019s often partying with people a decade younger. She does cocaine sometimes, and it makes her quite verbally aggressive. All of our friends are married, having kids, and she\u2019s made comments when we\u2019ve gotten married, such as saying she\u2019s really not sure a couple that\u2019d been together seven years was ready to get married. She hasn\u2019t ever truly been in a serious relationship. A lot of us have, frankly, chalked it up to jealousy. \n\nI\u2019m pregnant now, finally. My husband and I struggled with infertility for over two years. I am in my second trimester. \n\nI got together with Kate and a few other friends the other day. I had a feeling she was on coke, just from her eyes (I don\u2019t know if these friends know she uses). This conversation ensued. \n\nShe asked me out of the blue \u201cwill I be a good mom?\u201d I said sure. She started saying she knows she\u2019ll be better than me. That she\u2019s more emotionally stable and I\u2019m not. That she\u2019s raised kids before (she worked as a nanny for a couple years) and just not everyone is meant to have kids. She said if I am not ready for this, I shouldn\u2019t do it. She said I have options. \n\nI was in shock and beyond hurt. Kate is well aware that we\u2019ve gone through fertility challenges and treatment. She knows I\u2019m thrilled to be pregnant. This conversation occurred completely out of the blue - we weren\u2019t talking about my pregnancy at all!\n\nI snapped and said \u201cI know I\u2019ll be better than a coked out loser who hasn\u2019t left her parents house.\u201d And I left. \n\nOne of my friends texted me that that Kate was very hurt and I should apologize. I may have gone too far, but I\u2019m still beyond hurt by what Kate said to me. My husband, who doesn\u2019t enjoy Kate at all, told me I don\u2019t need to apologize- he wants me to cut her off completely. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I do not believe Kate is addicted to cocaine. You guys know that kid in high school who would brag he had 472882 shots of tequila followed by even more shots of vodka the night before, and you knew there was no way? That\u2019s kind of Kate.

My response was completely justified, and now I'm a little hurt, to be honest, that your text isn't asking if I am okay, not acknowledging how poorly Kate behaved, and centering Kate's feelings while ignoring my own.\"\n\nKate needs to be cut out. Coke, alcohol, living with the parents, partying, who cares. I have no judgment for Kate on her life, her plans, or her lifestyle. But you do not need people in your life who pick at you and put you down, and also create tornadoes of drama wherever they go, and that is exactly what Kate did here. She was mean for no reason, you matched her energy, now you have a friend texting you, you are writing on reddit about it, you probably are thinking about it a lot, etc. And you don't need that kind of energy in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a smart guy. You should marry him.", "My response would be, \u2018I\u2019ll apologise for calling her a coked out loser when she apologises for suggesting that I\u2019ll be such a shit Mom I should abort my very-much loved and wanted baby.\u2019\n\nThen let silence reign. Put your phone on mute for 24 hours and go do something nice with your awesome hubby.", "NTA, I would also cut ties with her. It's hard to be friends with someone when they just won't keep their opinions to themselves.", "NTA. Do you care she was \"very hurt\"? Wasn't what she said very hurtful? Why are your \"friends\" asking that you apologize for your comment, but not asking Cokey McGee to apologize too?", "NTA - why do people feel the need to comment on other peoples' parenting skills before the baby is even born? Sounds like she's jealous and was trying to take away some of your happiness.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I would have called her worse. \n\nIgnoring everything she might be (jealous etc), her comments about you as a mother and taking care of the baby were not acceptable and incredibly hurtful. Has she reached out to apologize? Are your friends who say she is hurt asking her to apologize to you?\n\nIt maybe time to consider what you get from this friendship these days, and if it's only situations like this, then it's okay to let the friendship end. Friends for life rarely happen, and most friendships end without a bang. And that's okay!! \n\nFocus on your baby and husband and life and just walk away from this all. Apologize if it will make you feel better, forgive her and yourself, and walk away from friends like that.", "NTA. It sounds like you outgrew this friendship years ago. What she said was outright hurtful and malicious. You should not invite her back to your life.", "NTA. The things she said were calculated to hurt, they really couldn't have been otherwise.", "NTA. \n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d out of the blue says you\u2019ll be a bad mom and you should abort, and then gets upset when you call her what she is? Nah. \n\nI second hubby\u2019s recommendation of cutting her out completely. She\u2019s obviously one of those friends that\u2019s you\u2019re only seeing because you\u2019ve been friends for too long and there wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to stop being friends. Now you have a good enough reason.", "NTA. Her comments  were out of line and completely unsolicited. I\u2019m sure Kate needs help and addiction issues are no joke, but what she said to you was catty and downright toxic, and you don\u2019t need that kind of vibe around you or your family. If you feel too bad, send her a text or a letter, apologize for what you said and explain how what SHE said was way out of line\u2026 then tell her you wish her well and, as your hubby suggested, say goodbye to her. \n\nEDIT: Also, I would question why that \u201cfriend\u201d texted you defending Kate and making her look like a victim but not at ALL asking about you or showing any support for you after what Kate said.", "NTA.  She's jealous, so lashing out at you.  Coke heads will say some seriously stupid shit.  I say this having been there/done that in my youth.", "NTA\nWhat you said was rude but Kate was also very rude. Why does she feel the need to berate you on certain things and potentially others? Like you said probably because she is jealous. Tbh I agree with your husband it\u2019s better to cut her off completely rather then being around here. But in the end it\u2019s your choice.", "NTA it sounds like she had it coming. Very fair response to what she said to you.", "Nta she was out of pocket and you had to remind her that she\u2019s in no place to be talking", ">She started saying she knows she\u2019ll be better than me. \n\nher coke use aside, this statement itself is incredibly obnoxious. she's basically saying you are not fit to be a mom.\n\ndrop her. she has no respect for you & frankly she is rude as hell.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - She was incredibly rude to you, if she can't handle the heat, she needs to stay out of the kitchen.  \n\nKate does sound like someone who would be better as an ex-friend, than someone to have in your life.  Congrats on the Pregnancy!", "Maybe \u201ccoked out loser\u201d was a bit harsh (assuming she has a coke problem?) but your friend bringing up pregnancy and weirdly saying she would be a better parent was bizarre and uncalled for.", "NTA something is telling me she\u2019s envious. But I do agree with your husband, you don\u2019t need to deal with that in your life. I would apologize to her and never talk to her again just so there\u2019s no bad blood.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You retaliated (naturally).  Just avoid each other, you clearly despise each other.", "ESH, and you two are not actually friends. Just drop contact", "ESH her far more than you though. Yes you were excessively harsh, I'd have kept it to the coke part. She on the other hand likes her coke and was being shitty about you getting pregnant so yeah she definitely sucks.", "Kinda ESH to be honest. She sucks because she said shitty horrible things about you and you are rightly upset.\n\nYou suck because you clearly don't like her and look down on how she lives her life. 'She's just jealous of our marriages'.\n\nYou should all probably stop hanging out.", "NTA, and I would dump her as a friend. Not from the drug use or her life choices, or for being behind you in terms of maturity.. but for the fact that she is incapable of being happy for other people. She seems like no matter what happens to people in her life she assumes she would be better than them if she was in their situation, but that's unfair and selfish. Do you really want her to be in your kids life?", "Nta. What you said was true, she\u2019s a woman in her 30s living at her parents addicted to cocaine idk how she could not be a loser in that scenario. Kate definitely has a coke problem though She doesn\u2019t have to be selling all of her possessions and living on the streets to be considered having a drug problem. Her doing coke in a normal not party setting where no one else is having a grand time whilst hurting her friends is a clear sign that she has a problem.", "NTA at all. You handled it way better than she should have expected. It sounds like Kate has major inadequacy/self esteem issues and is projecting them (very viscously) onto those around her. Quite honestly, I\u2019d drop her like a hot spud. She sounds like the type that will never be happy for you and will always try to knock you down whenever you have something to be joyous about; especially if those joys are involving your budding family.", "NTA, she sounds insufferable", "Just reply \u201cif you mess with the bull, you will get the horns\u201d.", "NTA.  Kate is very toxic & you don't need that in your life especially while you are pregnant.  Your husband is right to cut her off completely.", "ESH only because you should have cut off this friendship a long time ago. She sounds awful. Why are you keeping someone like this in your life? What positive contribution to your life does she make?", "NTA. Take what she says with a grain of coke lol", "YNTA.\nYeah so basically this crazy ass friend tries to make you sad and hurt you, when you're going though one of the most important moments of your life?\n\nThis friend should just, to put it frankly, stop the crack, and leave you alone. Just unfriend her or something. This is messed up.", "NTA and don't apologize.  It is quite obvious that she is jealous, has self esteem issues, and has not grown up.  Maybe your reply was exactly what she needed to hear since no one else had the brass balls to do it.\n\nMaybe do yourself and Kate a favor; start creating some distance.  Her jealousy, fueled with cocaine could create a nasty situation.\n\nFinally, congratulations on your upcoming arrival! Cheers!", "NTA\n\nI mean, she does coke\u2026 so your assessment of her being a coked out loser, seems fairly accurate.", "What she said to you was bizarre and inappropriate and frankly I would consider this an opportunity to end a friendship you have long outgrown. Your other friend is holding you to a much higher standard than Kate. \n\nNTA", "NTA, it felt more than jsut commenting on your parenting skills, it felt like she\u2019s implying you\u2019ll be a bad mom or shouldn\u2019t have a baby at all.

That\u2019s Kate.", "Thank you!", "I don\u2019t dislike her.", "I believe, knowing Kate, she meant adoption.", "Oof. Yeah you apologize after she has. \n\nUntil then keep living your best pregnant life and all the luck being new parents. You've got this!!\n\nSeriously, don't let Kate get to you. You don't need people in your life like that. And the friends that were there -- if they don't have your back, rethink spending time with them too.", "Kate needed to hear that. Sincerely, the guy who was \u201cthat guy\u201d in high school who desperately needed to hear that.", "She absolutely has a problem if she's showing up high to things where that's not socially expected", "If you think she\u2019s doing coke secretly while in a group who doesn\u2019t do it, she has a coke problem. FYI. She\u2019s still an AH though", "either way. that\u2019s a messed up thing to someone that had been trying for a baby", "No need to defend her. She said her quiet thoughts out loud. Your husband is right. She needs to be removed from your life. She's not a friend, she's a hater.", "In high school, it\u2019s more understandable. In your thirties, it\u2019s not.", "Ditto to the behaviour, honestly. Being mean out of jealousy is a thing kids do. If you're 32 and telling an adult, married person who got pregnant very much on purpose that they're going to be a bad mom and \"have options\" then you have big, big problems.", "That\u2019s true. It\u2019s cringe that she\u2019s partying with people in their early twenties. Where does she make these friends? That\u2019s like me right now showing up to a prom after party", "Couldn't agree more. You are NTA and I'd wager if she was truly hurt by your words she might just use them as motivation to clean up her act. Good on you, op.", "Good point!", "Oh god, thank you for that comparison, I think I'd rather die than attend an after-prom party", "I\u2019d rather have morning sickness everyday the rest of my pregnancy."]}
