My husband and I struggled with infertility for over two years. I am in my second trimester. \n\nI got together with Kate and a few other friends the other day.

My response was completely justified, and now I'm a little hurt, to be honest, that your text isn't asking if I am okay, not acknowledging how poorly Kate behaved, and centering Kate's feelings while ignoring my own.\"\n\nKate needs to be cut out. Coke, alcohol, living with the parents, partying, who cares. I have no judgment for Kate on her life, her plans, or her lifestyle. But you do not need people in your life who pick at you and put you down, and also create tornadoes of drama wherever they go, and that is exactly what Kate did here. She was mean for no reason, you matched her energy, now you have a friend texting you, you are writing on reddit about it, you probably are thinking about it a lot, etc. And you don't need that kind of energy in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a smart guy. You should marry him.", "My response would be, \u2018I\u2019ll apologise for calling her a coked out loser when she apologises for suggesting that I\u2019ll be such a shit Mom I should abort my very-much loved and wanted baby.\u2019\n\nThen let silence reign. Put your phone on mute for 24 hours and go do something nice with your awesome hubby.", "NTA, I would also cut ties with her. It's hard to be friends with someone when they just won't keep their opinions to themselves.", "NTA. Do you care she was \"very hurt\"? Wasn't what she said very hurtful? Why are your \"friends\" asking that you apologize for your comment, but not asking Cokey McGee to apologize too?", "NTA - why do people feel the need to comment on other peoples' parenting skills before the baby is even born? Sounds like she's jealous and was trying to take away some of your happiness.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I would have called her worse. \n\nIgnoring everything she might be (jealous etc), her comments about you as a mother and taking care of the baby were not acceptable and incredibly hurtful. Has she reached out to apologize? Are your friends who say she is hurt asking her to apologize to you?\n\nIt maybe time to consider what you get from this friendship these days, and if it's only situations like this, then it's okay to let the friendship end. Friends for life rarely happen, and most friendships end without a bang. And that's okay!! \n\nFocus on your baby and husband and life and just walk away from this all. Apologize if it will make you feel better, forgive her and yourself, and walk away from friends like that.", "NTA. It sounds like you outgrew this friendship years ago.

Nah. \n\nI second hubby\u2019s recommendation of cutting her out completely. She\u2019s obviously one of those friends that\u2019s you\u2019re only seeing because you\u2019ve been friends for too long and there wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to stop being friends. Now you have a good enough reason.", "NTA. Her comments  were out of line and completely unsolicited. I\u2019m sure Kate needs help and addiction issues are no joke, but what she said to you was catty and downright toxic, and you don\u2019t need that kind of vibe around you or your family. If you feel too bad, send her a text or a letter, apologize for what you said and explain how what SHE said was way out of line\u2026 then tell her you wish her well and, as your hubby suggested, say goodbye to her. \n\nEDIT: Also, I would question why that \u201cfriend\u201d texted you defending Kate and making her look like a victim but not at ALL asking about you or showing any support for you after what Kate said.", "NTA.  She's jealous, so lashing out at you.  Coke heads will say some seriously stupid shit.  I say this having been there/done that in my youth.", "NTA\nWhat you said was rude but Kate was also very rude. Why does she feel the need to berate you on certain things and potentially others? Like you said probably because she is jealous.

Beg them to get help a few times, sure. If it continues? Kick them out of the house. Cut contact. Tell them you won\u2019t watch them fucking die and ruin their lives. They\u2019ll either straighten out or do the inevitable, which Id rather not be a part of if that\u2019s all they plan on doing.", "Totally she's deep in it. But it's not OP problem. And rather stay far from the drama to happen. Kate is lik\u00e9 a car crash on slow motion.", "My husband and I did that too. It was so much fun!", "Congrats OP! So thrilled for your pregnancy. Kate should have never said that and I'd have to agree with your husband. Definitely NTA", "Please do some basic research on harm reduction", "This is the vibe I got, too.", "That's how I read it too.", "Oh I agree. It\u2019s easy to sort of convince ourselves it\u2019s \u201cnot *that* bad\u201d (like the edit saying she\u2019s not addicted). I encourage OP to be realistic about how bad it actually is, and if she wants that around her family going forward.", "Yeah. She\u2019s not being a cheerleader for her friend.", "Y'all stop upvoting, it's a bot", "NTA\n\nKate sound like the person who likes to pull the wings off of bugs to watch them squirm. She is also jealous of you and your success. \n\nYou need to ditch your friend, she is toxic. Oprah Winfrey said it best, \"You can't be friends with someone who wants your life.\"", "She started it, by saying all those hurtful things. If she didn't want to be called out then she should have kept her mouth shut. If she wants an apology from you, then you deserve an apology from her, first. \n\nBut honestly I wouldn't bother. I'd take this opportunity to cut her out. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy, I hope the remainder goes smoothly for you.", "NTA- Kate sees her friends moving on to other life pursuits while she's stuck. Kate has a coke habit that is likely more of a problem than you can see because addicts hide their addiction. However much she can control it when she thinks she needs to, out of sight could be much worse. You could tell her that you are worried about her well-being. What she said was awful, but only you can decide if it is worth ending or changing your friendship.", "NTA, listen to your husband", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend.", "NTA\n\nCut her out.", "NTA. What kind of friends standby and let you get verbally put down and then expects you to apologize after snapping? Screw them. You don't need friends like that. \n\nCongrats on the pregnancy.", "Nta\n\nShe's definitely an addict. You just can't see it because her parents are supporting her.", "NTA. I agree with the husband, cut her off completely, since you don't have any interests involving drugs and her way of life, why keep her?", "I agree with your husband. Just disengage entirely", "Kate told you to consider an abortion KNOWING you tried for the child you are carrying and deeply want it.  NTA.  You are the one owed an apology. But honestly, I would never talk to Kate again.", "NTA your friend your rules", "I broke up with my friend of thirty years when she told me I was so mentally ill that I should never  have had kids.  (I have extremely well medicated and monitored bipolar.) i was like, you can say a lot of shit that I can forgive, but that particular shit penetrates to my soul and I just can\u2019t have it in my life.", "It\u2019s kind of worse. A coke head letting it be known they think you\u2019ll be a shit mother, and want your baby.. I\u2019d be buying a shotgun and cutting contact with the coke head yesterday.", "But OP also said her eyes were red and otherwise looked like she was high", "100% agree. My brother was an addict for years and years and he was annoying as fuck on and off. It's like when he was coked up, he'd ignore boundaries. All of them everyones. When he got clean it was so different even different to the like days he wasn't high but waiting for the weekend to go get high at a rave again feeling that he lived in for years. \n\nUnfortunately, he didn't least long clean 3 years, and then he went to a big rave. He did as much coke as he'd used to do and died of an enormous heart attack.\n\nI digress, ops sil sounds like the shit he'd come out with while ignoring polite boundaries.", "No I get the impression that Kate wants to scare the OP off from having the child\u2026 so that Kate still has a hookers\u2019n\u2019blow mate to hang out with and do stupid stuff with. \n\n  \nKate is probably an addict\u2026 of something \u2026. And doesn\u2019t want to lose her lifestyle, at the expense of every/any thing else.", "For sure!  Do you get anything positive, supportive, uplifting or enlightening from your relationship with her?  If not then is she really someone you want in your child's life?\nNTA", "Agreed. This is something I've observed many times that I call \"abuse of the neurotypical.\" If one person has known problems such as emotional or mental disorders, addiction, is on the spectrum or suffers from anxiety or ADHD, those around them will seek to accommodate them by telling anyone who appears to be better off to get out of the way. How many times have we heard, or even said, \"she can't help it, it's the way he is, just let him have his way, you know she's struggling\"? But an obvious problem is that you can't always assume just by looking at them that an individual can just roll over and deal for the sake of someone who is open about their issues; many people who seem calm and capable and assured are dealing with their own anxiety, their own depression, or maybe getting emotionally overwhelmed inside in part thanks to their own place on the spectrum. And even if the person on the receiving end isn't afflicted with one of the many conditions, great or small, that make life harder for so many of us, it's still a horrible practice to expect someone to take abuse or suffer indignities to make life comfortable for someone else. \n\nKatie has obvious problems, and probably made a big fuss about how badly her feelings were hurt to the friend. The friend should be smart enough to understand that what Katie said was out of line, and not let her off the hook just because she got sad.", "I believe in harm reduction as a matter of public policy. I don't think individuals with emotional ties and responses to an addict's behavior are responsible for that harm reduction.\n\nI think all addicts deserve compassion, empathy, safety, and a path to recovery. I believe those in recovery deserve the support and encouragement they need to stay on that path. I do NOT think that any of that is owed to them by the people that they've directly hurt. Or at the very least not in the same way or timeline.\n\nI have not seen nor can I find any research that looks at the effects of \"tough love\" vs harm reduction on an individual, intrapersonal relationship level. If you have any such sources, I am absolutely open to changing my mind, but until then, I don't think it's appropriate to tell people who have been harmed by someone else's addiction that they should be an endless well of compassion, lest their boundaries result in the overdose of a loved one.", "Yup. I can 99% guarantee this woman is an addict. At some point, she\u2019s going to become more self destructive and it\u2019s important to consider how this will play out if you continue to stay in her life, and how this will impact your child and SO.", "Fair enough, I was talking more on a general level and how stigmatizing language can prevent drug users as a group from getting assistance. I don\u2019t mean to tell individuals what to do with their personal relationships. Sorry if that was unclear!"]}
