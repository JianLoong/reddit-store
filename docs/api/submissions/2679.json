I finally moved out mid 20s despite my dad insisting that he would die of a heart attack if I shamed him by moving out). I think they love me in their way, but it was conditional and controlling, and I hope it's better for you than it was for me.

I think it's highly inappropriate for you to be forced to allow 3 teenage boys, that you barely know, into your room. It has the possibility of being unsafe for you. Even if that's not the case, the boys have no business having access to a young woman's personal items. If you leave to go to the bathroom are they going to start snooping?

I know you're a teen, and anything over 30 may seem old... but your dad is unlikely to be so old that his attitude here is anywhere near excusable by age.\n\nIf anything, he's likely within a decade of my age either direction, and I'm at the low end of my 50s. Wiith teens of my own. And I ain't old.\n\nI agree with the previous commenter that your dad is being an AH.\n\nIf my teens did not want visitors hanging out in their room, then the visitors would not hang out in their room. End of story.\n\nAnd if the concern was because those visitors might break my kids stuff... Well frankly, that would be not just a keep 'em out of their room reason, but a keep 'em where I can keep an eye on 'em reason.\n\nI also find it notable that the boys are teens or nearly so themselves. Which means they are fully capable of being guests in someone elses home without breaking stuff. They're just not being held to appropriate standards to live up to their capability. But thats not their fault. Any fault there lies with their parents. Which may qualify their parents for sphincter-hood also.\n\nHonestly, if your parents, and these other couples want to hang out without being disturbed by their kids, and the boys can't visit without being a disturbance or trashing the room they're relegated to, then the other parents should be leaving their kids home for a few hours. They're all old enough for that. And if they're incapable of trusting their kids to be home alone without them, they've got bigger problems.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t blame you. Your father is\u2026 how shall I say, not quite caught up to the modern world. He should not be demanding teens get to spend time in other teens\u2019 bedrooms in general.

Someone else did say I could try hiding stuff under my bed so I think I'll do that too.", "Maybe, but there really isn't anything I can do about it now.", "I'm so sorry you had to go through that with your parents.

I think I'll try that. Thanks for the advice!", "I don't know. Maybe they bring them over because it was okay before, but we were little back then. Of course we would get along better back then than now.", "Wow. I never thought about it that way.

I'm assuming that is out of bounds in case something gets damaged.", "Can't or won't ?", "When you said you stopped hanging out much as you all got older I took that as you didn't really know them anymore because people change a lot between grade school and teen. I'm sorry for the assumption. \n\nI still don't believe it's appropriate for them to be in your room. You have a right to your privacy. I think you are going to have to sit down with your dad and have a fairly uncomfortable conversation about why you need your privacy. Maybe make a list of things you want to talk about and reasons why they are important to you that way you don't forget. I do this because I get flustered and it helps me to have a list to get back on track. This is just suggestion and ultimately you have to do what you are comfortable with.", "What?", "NTA.\n\nYour grandparents are on your side. I'm sorry to say it but your dad may not listen to what people on here are saying because it's coming from you. \n\nGet your grandparents to talk to him. Remind him what he was like as a teenage boy. Remind him that you're entitled to your privacy. Inform him that by allowing the three boys into your room without your permission, he's setting everyone up for failure: you for learning how to ignore feeling uncomfortable or unsafe because... company? And the boys for learning that they get to invade someone's space when the person isn't welcoming it. \n\nDo you have only one common space in the house? Where are the adults going to gather? If you only have a living room, I get why your dad wants the kids 'out of the way'. If you have two spaces, well, I don't know what he's thinking. \n\nTl;dr get your grandparents to stand up for you. Good luck!", "NTA. Get a lock and install it - even a simple bolt you can throw from the inside to keep them out. Perhaps your grandparents will help you install it - call them!\n\nYour parents and the kids parents just want to dump them on you so they can be free to talk and do what they want. Using you as a free babysitter, unpaid - and they DO NOT CARE if your stuff gets broken. This is very SELFISH of them, yet many parents will do this instead of supervising their own children.", "NTA, I get it. YOu need personal space.", "Don't announce it beforehand, just close yourself in your room to study before everyone arrives, and keep at it until they're gone. Make sure you have enough water and maybe a power bar to get you through so you don't have to emerge.", "she\u2019s 14 and the boys are 15/12/13. that only works on 6 years old", "Have not spoken to him?", "The other parents may either not know there's issues, or they might not care.\n\nIf they know and don't care, you may be stuck unless you can get an adult to advocate for you. Your parents should be doing that, since they do know your concerns. But it sounds like your dad, at least, doesn't care. It also doesn't sound like the other adults in the house are doing much to advocate for you either. Its just not clear if they're actively agreeing with your dad's viewpoint, or just passively avoiding conflict.\n\nIf the other parents don't know, they're not likely to know until they're told. Obviously your parents aren't going to say much. You could try to advocate for yourself, but the success of that may depend on whether you think they'd care if they do know.\n\nIf they might care, there may be a few options for doimg so.\n\nIf you don't think they would care... well at that point, your best bet might be hiding your most precious breakables somewhere safe outside your room and just weathering the storm the best you can."]}
