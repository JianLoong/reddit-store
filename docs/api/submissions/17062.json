She only found that out recently. Unfortunately, she found herself being evicted due to rent arrears and has nowhere to go and the local council won\u2019t help her because they claim it\u2019s her fault because she refused to pay the landlord. \n\nI moved in with my girlfriend a month ago. Evelyn, my girlfriend (f31) owns her flat. It\u2019s got a bedroom, a sitting room and her home office. I work physically so I don\u2019t need a home office but she\u2019s a translator (she translates books) and mostly works from home. \n\nWhen I found out Chantelle needed a place to stay, I asked Evelyn but she refused claiming she needed her office. I gave her a few days hoping that she\u2019d understand the difficult position Chantelle is at but she wouldn\u2019t budge. So I approached her again, telling her she could work from our bedroom or anywhere really but it\u2019s cruel to leave a pregnant young woman all alone.\n\nShe still refused. Told me she\u2019s only met Chantelle once and CJantelle  was rude to her. I told her it\u2019s the hormones and she shouldn\u2019t of taken it personally. She told me i was out of my mind if I thought she\u2019d give up her office for someone who wouldn\u2019t even pay rent. \nI said she couldn\u2019t expect a homeless person to pay her rent and she didn\u2019t ask me so why should my friend.\nShe wasn\u2019t happy with that. She told me her answer was final and not to bother her anymore about that.\n\nI said I lived there too and she must take my opinion into consideration.\nShe replied with \u201cthat can change.\u201d\n\nI told her she was the asshole for saying that  but she replied that I was the asshole for even suggesting something so outrageous. She locked herself in the office to work. Im furious with her, she\u2019s so out of line. Im about to go out with some mates as it\u2019s Friday and I vented to one of them and he told me that I was the asshole. I thought I was right but my mate agreeing with her took me by surprise and I wonder. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: perhaps I didn\u2019t explain properly. Chantelle is a vulnerable young woman in need of help they Evelyn could easily provide.", "created_utc": 1683909515, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fq5l7/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_give_up_her_home/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since you seem to be such a nice and caring guy- maybe buy an old building and turn it into a homeless shelter? Evelyn is obviously not seeing what a caring and compassionate man you are. I cant believe your own friend doesnt even see what a heart of gold you have!! The nerve of these people.

You wouldn\u2019t have been if you asked once and acknowledged that you understood what a big ask it was. Instead you asked twice, said her refusal to give up the space she works in was cruel, and ignored her perfectly valid feelings about being treated rudely and not being compensated for the additional cost and effort a long-term guest brings. You not getting your way- especially not when you were not giving anything up on this scenario- doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration, it means she didn\u2019t agree.

Get it yourself you entitled MF", "YTA \n\nIt's her flat she owns. She needs the office to work out of.

If you're supposed to pay rent, you have the ability to pay rent, and you refuse to pay rent, that is 100% a choice that was made!", "YTA. It\u2019s HER place, she gets to decide who stays there. If you keep pushing this, you probably won\u2019t be staying there either.", "YTA Your GF has a legitimate need for a home office. Your friend's situation, while a bad one, is not your GF's to fix.

And I can't even imagine expecting my SO, who I just recently moved in with, to let a young pregnant woman who they're not even friends with move in with no expectation of them paying rent. If I were her, I would likely start wondering if the baby is yours.\n\nAlso, yes, you live there. But for certain things, it \\*always\\* should be 'One no nixes it'. Pets. Baby names.

Why do have such an allegiance to Chantelle?  Are you the father of the baby?", "Info: Where's the baby's father? Actually. I have a better question. Why are you so determined on Chantelle moving into your girlfriend's home?", "YTA, why are you pushing so hard? Is the baby yours or something? It\u2019s her place, she said no, end of story.

There is no way in hell I am letting someone move into my home that was rude to me and can't pay rent. YTA. When I was pregnant, I had control over how I treated people, so that is a shitty excuse. Why didn't your friend pay her rent? This is her problem not your girlfriends.", "YTA. If you want to help Chantelle so badly, YOU do it. With your own money, space, ect.

But you just showed your gf you ZERO respect for her job or her safe space. She told you no and that your friend was rude to her, and you completely dismissed her, and said it was \"hormones\". News flash, being pregnant isn't a free pass to be a dick.\n\nAlso if this friend is so special and close to you, that you're demanding this ridiculous request, why your girlfriend just meeting her now when she's pregnant? Sounds like you have some type of Savior complex that you need to fulfill at the expense of others.\n\nYTA and why on earth You would want to take someone into your house who even your community sees as a leech, is beyond me. Maybe it's because it's not actually in your name so when it came time to evict her that would be all on your girlfriend?", "YTA. This is your girlfriends flat, it's not yours and so you can't demand that she give up her home office for your pregnant friend.\n\nHow entitled can you be??

If you wanted to live with Chantelle you should have done that.  Why should Evelyn let a pregnant woman who refused to pay rent at her last place, and has been rude to her, move into her home. Not being funny but if you work from home, you NEED your home office. I feel so sorry for Evelyn, she is in an awful position, she thought she was moving her relationship forward with her partner and this is what she ended up with.", "YTA. Kinda sounding like it could be your baby tbh.", "YTA, \n\nThis is a major red flag for your partner.

Big time. \n\nYou either have a white knight complex, or a serious crush on Chantelle. Probably both, if I'd have to take a guess. \n\nWhy can't she stay with family? Or other friends? Why does it HAVE to be you, when your gf clearly isnt into it? And with good reason, I might add. She doesn't like Chantelle, so ofc she doesn't want her to move in. Also, if you work from home, a home office isn't just a luxury. Having a dedicated workspace is strongly advised. So get off your high horse about that.\n\nYour comments don't sound at all like you're going to accept the judgement though.

She only found that out recently. Unfortunately, she found herself being evicted due to rent arrears and has nowhere to go and the local council won\u2019t help her because they claim it\u2019s her fault because she refused to pay the landlord. \n\nI moved in with my girlfriend a month ago. Evelyn, my girlfriend (f31) owns her flat. It\u2019s got a bedroom, a sitting room and her home office. I work physically so I don\u2019t need a home office but she\u2019s a translator (she translates books) and mostly works from home. \n\nWhen I found out Chantelle needed a place to stay, I asked Evelyn but she refused claiming she needed her office. I gave her a few days hoping that she\u2019d understand the difficult position Chantelle is at but she wouldn\u2019t budge. So I approached her again, telling her she could work from our bedroom or anywhere really but it\u2019s cruel to leave a pregnant young woman all alone.\n\nShe still refused. Told me she\u2019s only met Chantelle once and CJantelle  was rude to her. I told her it\u2019s the hormones and she shouldn\u2019t of taken it personally. She told me i was out of my mind if I thought she\u2019d give up her office for someone who wouldn\u2019t even pay rent. \nI said she couldn\u2019t expect a homeless person to pay her rent and she didn\u2019t ask me so why should my friend.\nShe wasn\u2019t happy with that. She told me her answer was final and not to bother her anymore about that.\n\nI said I lived there too and she must take my opinion into consideration.\nShe replied with \u201cthat can change.\u201d\n\nI told her she was the asshole for saying that  but she replied that I was the asshole for even suggesting something so outrageous. She locked herself in the office to work. Im furious with her, she\u2019s so out of line. Im about to go out with some mates as it\u2019s Friday and I vented to one of them and he told me that I was the asshole. I thought I was right but my mate agreeing with her took me by surprise and I wonder. Was I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
