She's not going to want to cuddle you much longer. You maybe have a year left. And you're throwing that time away instead of cherishing it.", "I didn't realize there is an age limit for parental affection. When I'm too big for my mom's lap, I'll start holding her. My 16 yo still curls up for snuggles.", "YTA. And handled that terribly. You made her feel like she'd done something wrong. People sit in their parents laps at all ages. I've seen full grown adults do it. She's a child. No wonder she's upset with you.", "YTA. You should have talked to her about it before hand rather than abruptly telling her to get off. \n\nWith no explanation from you, it\u2019s easy to get confused why something was okay one day and now it\u2019s not. If you\u2019re both okay with cuddling, what\u2019s the problem?", "YTA. Your kid obviously loves you and shows love through cuddling up with you guys and feels comfortable. What you did by saying this is basically makes her feel embarrassed/bad about showing you guys love. Yikes", "Gonna say, YTA for the way you approached it.\n\nInstead of talking it out, in a neutral zone, ie before she\u2019s cuddling, you told her to get off.\n\nOf course she would be upset, you rejected her love in the moment she was wanting closeness with you.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with a literal child snuggling their parents.\n\nI used to curl up behind my moms legs when she laid on the couch (like when a cat tucks behind your bent legs) and we\u2019d watch movies together. I did that until I got too big to fit in that spot, so around age 15.\n\nDefinitely apologize to her, and maybe set a different snuggle boundary if you no longer want her to lap sit.", "Man that sucks for her. Imagine a parent rejecting your affection. YTA there is no such thing as to old for snuggling with a parent. Now if she's getting too heavy that's one thing but not too old. Kids pull away on their own and you're going to miss the days she wanted your attention. You just accelarated the speed at which she going to stop wanting to hug and be with you.", "YTA, why is it that once we reach a certain age we aren't allowed to show physical affection anymore? It doesn't matter what age anyone is we want to know we are loved.\n\nWhat is important is that you sit her down and explain that you still love her and it's not a punishment, cause she might see it that way. If you aren't comfortable anymore with it then explain you just want hugs now. But don't speak for others of how they want to express their love.\n\nThough I do understand she is at the age where she shoulder be learning about periods and stuff so teaching her how to say no to what makes her uncomfortable and what's ok and not ok for touching.", "YTA. Why are you denying her affection? I'm 29 and still cuddle with my mum from time to time. If I'm down, it helps immensely just having that comfort and love. If I was told, *at 11 years old,* that I was too old for affection from a parent, I would assume they no longer love me as much.\n\nYou should feel guilty.", "YTA - too old? No, that's for her to determine, not you.", "YTA. \n\nSometimes I'm not in the mood to cuddle so I'll tell my kids that I want some space. My bigger kids are starting to hurt so we do a modified legs on me butt next to me cuddle.\n\nI don't decide when they are too old.", "I don't understand this logic that as our children get older we shouldn't cuddle and hug them the same we did when they were small.\n\nOne day very soon she will choose herself to stop cuddling as much and snuggling.\n\nShe will barely hug you altogether and you will miss it.\n\nIt's gonna happen naturally, she will become less and less lovey as she becomes a teen.\n\nLet her enjoy being a cuddly child for as long as possible... \n\nI know its not your intention to tell her she's less lovable because she is older but that's why she got upset.\n\nGrowing up is hard and it sounds like she needs your support.\n\nI'm struggling between NAH and YTA.\n\nI'm gonna say YTA...and go give your daughter a hug and apologize... \n\nExplain why you said that.\n\nEven at 35 I still wish my mother had been affectionate and hugged us.", "What the heck, YTA. You just told your kid not to show you affection and now you are sad she isn\u2019t showing you affection? I know 30 year old women with their own kids who still sit on their mom\u2019s lap to hug them. You\u2019re the only one making it weird. Apologize to your daughter.", "YTA. All of us kids (28,33&35) still sit on our moms lap sometimes. I mean we balance because she\u2019s small but she\u2019s our mommy and always will be", "YTA. What is your reasoning for her being \"too old\" to sit in one of her parent's laps? I mean, if she were hopping into the laps of strangers or older unrelated men, then sure, I'd probably nip that behavior in the bud.  But still wanting to cuddle HER OWN PARENTS?! Shit, she should be able to do that as long as she wants! She can sit on your lap and cuddle you when she's 70 and your 90! The problem here sounds more like YOU are annoyed by this behavior and it is simply YOU who do not want her sitting on your lap.  If so, that is fine, and that is your prerogative to make choices about your own personal space. However, don't make it seem like it's your daughter who is being the problem here.  Instead, simply say that she is not too old to sit on her parents' laps and cuddle and she is allowed to want to do that, but she simply has to ask permission first. Her parents love her, but sometimes they want their laps to themselves, you know.  This is a great time to teach her about consent.  And consent goes both ways too.", "Yta if she is physically to large and hurting you, sure it's fine to switch to other cuddles.  But I'm 35 and still cuddle my parents bc I *love* them.", "INFO:  How did you tell her?  Did you literally say \"You're too old!  Get off me!\"?  Or did you say something like \"I enjoy snuggling with you, but you're no longer small enough to fit comfortably on my lap.  Why don't you sit next to me and we can snuggle up that way?\"\n\nThere's nothing wrong with directing a child towards more age-appropriate behaviors or expressing that something is no longer comfortable for you.  That's part of helping a child grow up.  But you do need to redirect them to a behavior that *is* appropriate (because they need to be taught, they don't automatically know) and reinforce that while your relationship with them is changing, your love for them is consistent.  If you literally told her to \"Get off\" with no warning, it's no wonder why she perceived that as rejection and is now completely confused as to what sort of physical affection is ok or will get her snapped at.", "YTA. My sons could be 40 years old and if they wanted to sit on my lap they could. The hell is wrong with you? All you're doing is teaching your child about negative rejection. Don't be shocked if she becomes a lot more distant with you now.", "There is no age limit on love YTA", "YTA. There is literally no such thing as too old to sit in your parent\u2019s lap. One day, there may be too heavy.\n\nEDIT: Believe it or not, a few hours after posting this my 11 year old daughter came and sat on my lap to have a cuddle and say goodnight. I don\u2019t know when she last did that but it made me think of this post and I asked her \u201c*Do you think you\u2019ll ever be too big to sit in my lap*?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe one day\u201d.  \n\u201cNot for a long time I hope\u201d.  \n\u201cYeah hopefully\u201d.  \n\u201cYou know you\u2019ll never be too *old* for it though don\u2019t you?\u201d.  \n<smiles> \u201cThat\u2019s good to know\u201d.", "YTA. now it\u2019s time to live a cuddle less life:(", "YTA- Wow, your job as a parent is to love your kid and keep them safe and you failed. They just wanted to show you affection and you shut it down cold. I bet that hurt them a lot. I get if someone is too heavy, but there's no age limit for lap sitting. Show your kid some love before it's too late.", "Yes. Yta.\n\nShe likes it. You don't seem to mind it beyond some sort of ageist preconception. It's not hurting you. Let her do it.\n\nI'm a 30 year old guy and i love sitting in someone's lap (for other, more romantic, reasons.. normally it's my partner)", "YTA.  Most parents I know would be thrilled if their 11 year old still wanted to cuddle.", ">I told her . . . to get off me\n\nOuch. My feelings hurt on her behalf. Couldn't have phrased it better?", "The way you talked to her without explaining, without being calm and understanding  YTA. Be a little more understanding. When my cousin (4 yrs older than me) was younger she sits on her mothers or dads lap all the time - till 14. I did find it awkward cause me as a kid was no lap-sitter at all. But there was nothing odd, sometime some kids act differently as expected. And that doesn't automatically mean something bad. Be gentle with her.", "Oh this makes me sad.  My kids are 7 and 1 and while i get that sometimes you can be over stimulated or over elbowed with pointy kid limbs, she's still only 11.  I thought you were going to say your kid was 18.   Find the time and energy to cuddle your baby!", "YTA. And you really, *really* hurt her too. This one may even be a core memory for her. Not much can fix this imo. She would need more affection from you and clearly you\u2019re uncomfortable with that.", "He's too big for my lap, but what I would do if my 17 year old wanted to curl up with me...\n\nI strongly suggest you approach your daughter and talk to her about this. Explain that you (and hopefully this is accurate) love her and want to cuddle, but didn't want her to feel uncomfortable and you handled it wrong. Hopefully she'll understand and the current tension will end.\n\nI totally get you not always wanting someone in your lap and in those situations I'd be careful about making blanket statements. Instead of, \"You're too old for this.\", say something like , \"I'm not feeling great...\" or \"I need some space...\" or whatever (but you oriented- not her oriented) \"...right now, but later would be great.\".  Or something to that effect. That way she knows it's temporary and that it isn't about her, it's about you.\n\nEdited to add YTA.", "YTA for not discussing it with her beforehand. Since your rejection came (seemingly) out of nowhere, she was understandably hurt. For all she knew, everything was fine, and then you (verbally, if not physically) pushed her away out of the blue.\n\nYou may not be wrong, but you went about this badly. IMO, you should have started this discussion with her for a while before you told her to get off you. I'd also caution you about rejecting affection from your kids while they still want to show it. And don't tell her to stay off your husband's lap - let HIM decide when that should happen!", "YTA - I still look forward to lap(ish) cuddles with my 18 and 15 yo kids. Why would you discourage your daughter from being close to you?", "YTA. \u201cOh honey, you are getting so big! Why don\u2019t you sit next to me and we can still cuddle?\u201d That\u2019s how you say without crushing your daughter\u2019s spirit.", "YTA. How is showing your child love and affection bad for them?! Why is that something that ends at a particular age?!! \nGo to your daughter, cuddle her, show and tell her how much you love her and apologise.", "YTA it's your kid, why wouldn't you want her to sit on your lap. Soon enough she won't want anything to do with you, I'd treasure it while you still can.", "That kind of rejection hurts, believe me. YTA", "YTA \nMy son will be 13 next month and I\u2019m not supposed to tell anyone, but he occasionally still likes to lay on my lap, cuddle and have me sing one of the songs I used to sing to him when he was a baby. \n\nI asked him how long he will let me cuddle with him and he said when he moves out and gets married. I think he\u2019s half serious.", "Why is she too old? What makes her too old? Why are you throwing away perfectly good cuddles from a daughter who probably won't want to touch you as soon as she turns 13?\n\nMy youngest child is 15 next week. They are autistic and have never liked to be kissed but they happily give the BEST cwtches. The day they decide (they, not me) they are too old for jumping on my lap and hugging tight will be a very sad day for me. \n\nYTA. Apologise and cwtch your daughter like it's your last.", "YTA - The time where she is going to want to show that kind of affection towards you is dwindling, and will go quick.  Then it will be a 180 and she will want less and less to do with you.  I wouldn't push her away too much.", "YTA.\n\nThere's no such thing as \"too old\" to show affection for your parents.\nI still love to throw myself with my parents on the couch and cuddle with them when we are watching movies or just the news... It's my way of telling them that I love them and that I enjoy their company.", "YTA- Im going on 27 and my sister is 23, if we go to our parents and had a tough day we still seek their comfort. No one is \u201cto old\u201d for a parents touch. You\u2019re just creepy.", "YTA - my 20 year old will ask if he can cuddle up to me when we watch a movie together. I have never denied him a cuddle. My 14 year old likes the occasional cuddle too. Since when is there an age limit on being affectionate to your kids?", "YTA.\n\nNo such thing as too old, just too big.", "YTA I'm almost 27 and I still cuddle with my parents. I'm way too heavy to sit on their laps, that'd be uncomfortable, so I sit next to them and lean over - you could have just asked your daughter to do that?\n\nTaking away affection in an abrupt, unprovoked manner is not the way to go about not babying your child. This is going to upset and confuse her, maybe make her wonder if she's angered you, if this is punishment. You should apologise, frankly", "YTA if only because you handled it so roughly.  You needed to sit down and explain to her rather than shoving her off so rudely.\n\nAnd for those who are using the \"bodily autonomy\"card in justifying their NTA  answer:  the issue isn't that OP didn't have the right to say no to child.  It is that mom doesn't need to model rudeness. Further, at age 11, the child is on the cusp of puberty, and gentle handling is required.", "YTA enjoy the cuddles while they last", "major yta! im 22 (about to be 23) guess what? i have no shame in cuddling with my parents or sitting on my mom\u2019s lap! \nyou definitely have a right to decide if you want someone in your lap (because consent) but my god the way you went about it. congratulations, your daughter probably won\u2019t be very affectionate with you now.", "YTA. I literally regularly \u201ccuddled\u201d my mom and dad until I moved out at 19. There\u2019s nothing wrong with showing your child love, and there is no age limit. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries but the way you communicated them was awful, and broke her heart. When you grow up with physical love being the currency, cutting that off all of a sudden is harsh.", "YTA. \nGetting an unsolicited hug from my 12 year old daughter is like finding $20 on the street- practically gold!!! \n\nShe wanted a cuddle and got a rejection instead, great job \ud83d\udc4f", "YTA, however just wait. I used to have the same opinion. You will eventually hit a wall where she doesn\u2019t want to have the same special relationship with you. I think you need to do the same thing with yourself that I did. You need to rethink how you view affection and interactions between people.", "What? Yta. I wouldn't blink an eye if any of my adult kids needed to sit on my lap. I know I had some adult life crises that required me to sit on my parent's laps and have a good cry.", "YTA she\u2019s your child and you\u2019ll never get that time back. Embrace it while she still wants to be close to you. Why on earth would you deter her from doing this. She\u2019s 11 not 18.", "The sad thing is you'll miss her cuddles one day..YTA", "YTA - that\u2019s pretty cold", "YTA.  My daughter is 16, 5\u20198\u201d and still will sit in my lap for a cuddle when she needs a little extra love after a rough day.  There is no too old.  You should be a safe landing spot for your child.", "My son is 22 and if he wanted to sit in my lap I\u2019d let him. You will miss those days when your daughter wanted to sit in your lap.", "This makes me so sad! I\u2019m 25 and I still love to snuggle with my parents!!!", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're going to miss those cuddles when she decides she's too big for your lap, or your hugs, or snuggles.   Enjoy it while you can, if you can after pushing her away.", "YTA. I absolutely let my kids get snuggles when they need/want and some are teenagers. I was never comfortable giving my mother hugs bc she made it weird that I wanted a hug. And I love that they still want hugs from me", "YTA. I've seen my adult female cousin sit on her mum's lap. Like after a long and stressful day at work. It's not abnormal or unhealthy. Teenagers usually go through a phase where they stop this behaviour and then maybe after they've had a couple of years of freedom they realise they miss things like cuddles or sitting on your lap.", "YTA for the way you said it. \u201cGet off of me\u201d is just plain hurtful for a child. Might as well have told her to eff off.", "YTA. You'll miss such things very, very soon. Take advantage and get all the cuddles you can now. In another year or two it'll be gone.", "YTA. And now, if you end up changing your mind about it, she could never want to do it again and your relationship will be forever changed by that one stupid comment.", "I remember when my dad said this to me. I was devastated. YTA", "Im 19 and still sit on my moms lap sometimes", "YTA, from her perspective you went from being totally cool with her being on your lap to hating it. She was expressing love and comfort with you and you completely shut her down. Use your words and explain your thinking, don't just tell her to get off with no explanation for the change in behavior.\n\nSooner than you think she wasn't going to be interested in sitting on your lap at all and rather than let her slide into that naturally, you pushed her like you pushed her off your lap.", "Wow yta. I\u2019m 24 and i still like to cuddle up to my mom sometimes. I think there was a polite way to talk to your daughter about it, but the way you rejected her was not okay. Physical affection between family members is normal", "Are you a tiny woman? You said your child is small, which cuts out my question of her being too large. \n\nMy thought is that she might be hurting you when in your lap.", "If either of my parents had said that to me at 11, I\u2019d be devastated. \n\nToo old why? What harm exactly is it doing?\n\nIn a couple years, she\u2019ll be a teenager and likely embarrassed to be within 10 feet of you until she\u2019s about 17. I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d make the most of this kind of affection while she\u2019s still so cuddly and tactile. \n\nYTA.", "Light YTA. I can understand your logic behind not wanting to have her on your lap anymore, but you should have sat her down for a conversation about it instead of just doing a random 180 on her. Without context, she probably feels like she did something wrong and you're punishing her.", "Soft YTA. I don\u2019t think affection is something that you really age out of, and she\u2019ll likely be wanting independence soon anyway. That said, a good approach I\u2019ve seen/use for kids \u201caging out\u201d of an activity is to tie it to a birthday and give them lots of notice, maybe tied with something new they\u2019re \u201caging into\u201d like older-age movies or a thing they can do independently. That way you\u2019re celebrating them becoming a big kid with them instead of just cutting them off out of the blue.", "YTA on the way you handled it.

Why not sit down and have a family conversation where everybody can add their input instead of just unilaterally deciding this and literally pushing your child away without any prior warning?", "Yta my mom said something similar about my 10 year old sister and I told her that she should enjoy all the hugs she's wanting to give us because we don't know how long she's still going to want to hug us all the time like that, you're horrible", "YTA. I\u2019m 24 and I still sit on my moms lap and cuddle with her. We are never too old for love and affection from the people we love.

She will 100% grow out of it.", "you're certainly allowed to have boundaries, but this sounds like you're imposing arbitrary rules on your kid that limit your affection for her.  i strongly recommend against this.  your kid is telling you that it made her feel bad and probably ashamed with her response.  i think the best way to maintain affection with your kid is to apologize and start a conversation about it.  THAT will show her you think she's getting older -- and that you respect her choices about how she wants to show love.", "YTA.

You rejected your daughter\u2019s affection. You rejected a comfort and show of love that she\u2019s been doing her whole life. Of course she\u2019s upset! You likely made her feel awkward, guilty, and betrayed. Telling her she\u2019s \u201ctoo old\u201d to cuddle is also very hurtful and is likely to make her resent growing up even more. What does growing up mean? Periods, hormones, and your parents don\u2019t love you anymore. \n\nYou should\u2019ve sat her down and had a conversation with her about \u201cappropriate\u201d ways to show affection and what other options she could have instead.

Being a child I had no idea what I was doing that was sexual (even as an adult I don\u2019t think it is) I just knew that being around and cuddling my parents made me bad. So I stopped, even now at 32 when my mom tries to give me a hug or a kiss it feels weird and I quickly move away. I do think you need to teach children about boundaries and how they change as you grow but be careful with how you do it because your daughter may never feel comfortable touching you again.", "YTA Why should she hug you goodnight?

If you prefer that she sits beside you to snuggle instead of on your lap, maybe explain that.

I was always his \"little girl\", even as a rebellious teenager and then a young woman.\n\nHim treating me as such never had a negative impact on my development, I easily found my independence and now I'm a grown woman with a child of her own. He was the only one who really treated me that way because I was the oldest of my siblings and I sort of became an afterthought. If anything, that warmth and nurturing he gave me probably saved my mental and emotional health in more ways than I can accurately express on here.\n\nYTA for pulling that on your child. There's no age limit to cuddling or sitting on your loved one's lap. Hang on to those cuddles and sitting on your lap as long as possible.

Not even with her own child.  Having a child does not mean you lose your ability to enforce physical boundaries or exercise bodily autonomy, especially when the child is 11 and well old enough to understand the concept.\n\nOP is absolutely wrong for HOW she handled it.  If she had handled it differently and redirected the child to a physically affectionate activity that she was comfortable with, there would be no issue here.  But her rejecting the child, snapping at them, and pushing them away were completely harmful.", "YTA.\n\nYou should be overjoyed your preteen daughter still wants to cuddle.

She obviously loves the affection and wouldn\u2019t you rather be the one she goes to when she wants to sit in someone\u2019s lap? It\u2019s not too late to salvage this, but you have to be open with your daughter and apologize. Now if she\u2019s starting to get too heavy or it hurts or you\u2019re physically incapable than I would ask her to compromise and do cuddles instead. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself and know everything in our society wants our children to grow up faster. If you can keep her \u201cyoung\u201d for longer than you should.

That does not diminish as we age.  We do our adolescents a huge disservice when we stop touching them affectionately. Whether it is our intention or not, we are telling them  \"now that you've begun sexually developing, all touch is sexual AND sex is the only way you are allowed experience physical affection.\"  Hopefully you can see the problem with this!!  Are there predators in this world?  Sadly, yes.  But we actually protect our children from them by letting them experience affectionate non-sexual touch.  If you want to protect her, teach her that touch is normal, is supposed to feel warm and affirming, and is always 100% her choice!!  I could go on and on with all of the studies about touch (part and parcel of my field) but I will limit myself to sharing one more nugget.  Studies show that (heterosexual) children have healthier and more resilient relationships with their romantic partners in adulthood if they maintained a solid physically affectionate relationship with their opposite sex parent!!  So assuming your husband isn't a predator (and I pray he isn't), your daughter continuing to be physically affectionate with her dad should give you comfort!!\n\nI hope this helps you relax and enjoy what sounds like your daughter's primary love language.", "YTA and much more", "My 20 y.o. daughter sent me this post because she's so sad for your daughter.

Because she didn\u2019t work through whatever it is that causes this discomfort at an innocent situation, voicing that discomfort would cause emotional harm (in my opinion) to that child and it\u2019s understanding of parental love etc. Unfortunately to not be the AH in this scenario requires OP to take the brunt of the issue. She shouldn\u2019t have had a child with unresolved issues.
