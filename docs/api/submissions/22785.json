The fact that a small child felt comfortable approaching a stranger on a train is scary enough, but the mom really doubled down when she approached you and basically demanded the Barbie cup for her daughter, and then had the absolute gall to blame you for her daughter\u2019s unhappiness!

What kind of entitlement shit is THAT? Some rando lady and her kid on a train just expect you to give her your stuff??? That kid is going to have a hard life... Nothing in life is free, you have to work for what you want and that Mom is setting her up for a life of narcissism and entitlement. Sorry you dealt with this, OP. NOT THE AH!", "She could make her OWN daughter happy by buying her the cup with her own damn money. I feel bad for the girl, that mom is immature", "JFC, just because someone likes something someone else has does not mean they get to have it, even if they're a kid.  NTA by any means!!!

That mom is wildly entitled. Good for you for standing your ground.", "NTA, but when that woman told her daughter that the bad woman was making her unhappy, I would have told the mother to wait and offered the cup to her for \u20ac1000.

If you said it was for your sister, then that should have been the end of the conversation. If her daughter wanted the cup, take her to see the movie and get her a cup.
