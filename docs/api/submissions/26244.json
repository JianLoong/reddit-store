This is a throwaway, since some of the information provided may easily identify me.\n\nMy (38F) old friend \"Sara\" (39F) and her husband \"Josh\" (39M) have a daughter (13F). Unfortunately, Sara's daughter has been getting bullied for the past few years, and it has been getting worse. She has  already switched schools, but the problem isn't going away. The school admin is aware of the bullying, but haven't done much to stop it.\n\nIn all honesty, I don't see the bullying stopping anytime soon. Why? Well, Sara's daughter's name is Syphilis. That is the name that these parents gave their child. When they announced her name 13 years ago, I was shocked and begged the both of them, especially Sara, to reconsider. They refused, and it is a huge reason why Sara and I aren't as close as we used to be. When I first heard that the daughter was getting bullied, I was upset, but not surprised.\n\nSo, here is where I may be the asshole. The other day, Sara came over and essentially cried on my couch about the way her daughter was being treated. I lent an ear, and comforted her, before suggesting to Sara that maybe, it may be a good idea if her daughter had a name change. Sara got mad at me and said that  had no right to tell her what to do with her child, and that the name she gave her daughter is the name she would have. I lost it. I told Sara that it is her fault that her daughter is getting bullied, and that I didn't know what she expected to happen after she named her child after an STD. Sara lost her shit after I said this, called me a shitty friend and yelled at me to get out of her house.\n\nI don't know where to go from here. I know that I lashed out at Sara which is why I feel like I am wrong. I know that it's not my place to tell her what she should do with her kid, but I do in all honesty, feel like she is to blame for giving her daughter such a vulgar name. AITA?\n\nEdit: Hi everyone. Just to clarify, yes, it was my home. Sara came over, and that is where I suggested that she changed her daughter's name. we fought, and afterwards, I was the one that told her to GTFO of my home. I'm kind of sick and high on pain meds right now, so I misspoke.
