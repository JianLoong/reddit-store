This is a throwaway, since some of the information provided may easily identify me.\n\nMy (38F) old friend \"Sara\" (39F) and her husband \"Josh\" (39M) have a daughter (13F).

That is the name that these parents gave their child. When they announced her name 13 years ago, I was shocked and begged the both of them, especially Sara, to reconsider. They refused, and it is a huge reason why Sara and I aren't as close as we used to be.

Sara got mad at me and said that  had no right to tell her what to do with her child, and that the name she gave her daughter is the name she would have. I lost it. I told Sara that it is her fault that her daughter is getting bullied, and that I didn't know what she expected to happen after she named her child after an STD. Sara lost her shit after I said this, called me a shitty friend and yelled at me to get out of her house.\n\nI don't know where to go from here.

Just to clarify, yes, it was my home. Sara came over, and that is where I suggested that she changed her daughter's name. we fought, and afterwards, I was the one that told her to GTFO of my home.
