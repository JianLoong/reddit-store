You two invested in giving your sister an experience that wasn't low cost, probably took some effort to acquire and was something you would have assumed she'd be excited about. It's understandable that she would be hurt that your sister sold off the gift. \n\nBut at the same time, you're right. Once you give someone a gift, it belongs to them and is up to them as to what to do with it.", "I can see both sides of this discussion.\n\nGF chipped in on the gift.  She wanted to do something special for your sister.\n\nBoth of you gave your sister something special, expensive concert tickets.  Let's call it a once in a life time experience.\n\nYour sister sold the tickets as someone else offered her a great deal.  You felt since the gift was you sister's she could do whatever she wanted with it.  Your GF wanted your sister to value the experience rather than the money.\n\nI do not think anyone is an a$$.", "NAH. You are both right. Once a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient to do with as they please. However, it\u2019s rude to tell the giver you sold it for a higher price because people want to believe they have given gifts that are meaningful. But but your sister is 18, and she treated you and your girlfriend to dinner. She thought she was doing the right thing. \n\nYou should acknowledge your girlfriend\u2019s disappointment. This must have been a popular concert, and your girlfriend must have been looking forward to hearing what a wonderful time your sister had. It had to have been hurtful to know your sister would rather have the money.", "I mean, your sister is the bigger AH here. I appreciate the opportunity to make money but considering it was a gift, I think she should have given you a bit of a heads up, especially if the gift was presented as being from both you and your gf. I agree that she can do as she pleases, but she should show some consideration and tell you beforehand.\n\nI don't think you're an AH per se, though you should have been more sympathetic to your gf's point.", "NAH", "I can see both sides here but I\u2019m leaning more toward your gf\u2019s point of view. Not that your sister can\u2019t do what she wants with a gift, but turning a gift for a large profit feels icky. I mean great for her and it was kind to take you out to dinner but I\u2019d be kind of pissed in the situation too. You\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re close.", "Your sister is an asshole, your gf is right.\n\nSelling a gift like that is pretty tacky, especially in-front of you guys.\n\nDon\u2019t be upset if she doesn\u2019t want to gift your family stuff in the future.", "NAH. Makes sense on both ends. Ultimately the gift was your sisters todo what she wishes with it", "Nah", "YTA.\n\nMostly for letting it escalate into an argument. This is such a trivial matter; state your opinion and then leave it be. Why take a side? Clearly your GF wanted to have a quick vent to get it over with, but you have just helped her start a grudge.", "NTA - even though your girlfriend doesn't appreciate your sister selling the tickets, it's not really any of her business. Once you hand over a gift, it's no longer yours to dictate what happens with it. You're right! I totally understand your girlfriend's disappointment though.", "NTA\n\nDude, she even treated you to a nice meal. Your sister is a hundred times more thoughtful than I was at her age.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nDidn't she show appreciation by taking you two out for dinner?", "NTA. A gift with strings attached is not a gift", "Broke parties broke the implied social rules, but a gift being yours to do what makes you happiest seems more important in this case.\n\nFor all you know she wasn't that interested in that band anymore and the money is going to be used for something she enjoys more.\n\nNTA", "NTA. A gift, freely given, ls the recipients to do with as they wish.", "NTA. Also your sister is not an A H neither because she show gratitude for the gift and did nothing wrong.", "NTA...  your reasoning is spot on.  And, how does your GF know that your sister didn't appreciate the gift?  I'm sure she appreciated it, but also appreciated the opportunity to make some money and take you two to dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Taylor Swift tickets are expensive as hell, but if someone gifted them to me I would 1,000% sell them because I have no interest in seeing the show.", "No one is an Ah.", "NAH except your sister. Sorry but that\u2019s a super shit thing to do. I would be pissed too.", "NTA, but your sister sure is. I suggest not giving her any more valuable presents.", "*Especially* since gf waited to say anything until they were alone. She didn't make a scene or anything, just voiced her disappointment.", "Yes exactly this!!! And she obviously made a lot more money than the treat she gave to OP and his gf. Gf's emotions are totally justified especially when she was kind and caring enough to initiate to contribute for the gift. The sister comes off as a little selfish, even after the dinner gesture. OP could've been more understanding of his gf's POV and not completely negated it.", "Yes lol. At her age i would have spent that money on beers\ud83d\ude02"]}
