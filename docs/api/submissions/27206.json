You two invested in giving your sister an experience that wasn't low cost, probably took some effort to acquire and was something you would have assumed she'd be excited about. It's understandable that she would be hurt that your sister sold off the gift. \n\nBut at the same time, you're right. Once you give someone a gift, it belongs to them and is up to them as to what to do with it.", "I can see both sides of this discussion.\n\nGF chipped in on the gift.  She wanted to do something special for your sister.\n\nBoth of you gave your sister something special, expensive concert tickets.  Let's call it a once in a life time experience.\n\nYour sister sold the tickets as someone else offered her a great deal.  You felt since the gift was you sister's she could do whatever she wanted with it.  Your GF wanted your sister to value the experience rather than the money.\n\nI do not think anyone is an a$$.", "NAH. You are both right. Once a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient to do with as they please. However, it\u2019s rude to tell the giver you sold it for a higher price because people want to believe they have given gifts that are meaningful. But but your sister is 18, and she treated you and your girlfriend to dinner. She thought she was doing the right thing. \n\nYou should acknowledge your girlfriend\u2019s disappointment. This must have been a popular concert, and your girlfriend must have been looking forward to hearing what a wonderful time your sister had. It had to have been hurtful to know your sister would rather have the money.", "I mean, your sister is the bigger AH here. I appreciate the opportunity to make money but considering it was a gift, I think she should have given you a bit of a heads up, especially if the gift was presented as being from both you and your gf. I agree that she can do as she pleases, but she should show some consideration and tell you beforehand.\n\nI don't think you're an AH per se, though you should have been more sympathetic to your gf's point.", "NAH", "I can see both sides here but I\u2019m leaning more toward your gf\u2019s point of view. Not that your sister can\u2019t do what she wants with a gift, but turning a gift for a large profit feels icky. I mean great for her and it was kind to take you out to dinner but I\u2019d be kind of pissed in the situation too. You\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re close.", "Your sister is an asshole, your gf is right.\n\nSelling a gift like that is pretty tacky, especially in-front of you guys.\n\nDon\u2019t be upset if she doesn\u2019t want to gift your family stuff in the future.", "NAH. Makes sense on both ends. Ultimately the gift was your sisters todo what she wishes with it", "Nah", "YTA.\n\nMostly for letting it escalate into an argument. This is such a trivial matter; state your opinion and then leave it be. Why take a side? Clearly your GF wanted to have a quick vent to get it over with, but you have just helped her start a grudge.", "NTA - even though your girlfriend doesn't appreciate your sister selling the tickets, it's not really any of her business. Once you hand over a gift, it's no longer yours to dictate what happens with it. You're right! I totally understand your girlfriend's disappointment though.", "NTA\n\nDude, she even treated you to a nice meal. Your sister is a hundred times more thoughtful than I was at her age.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nDidn't she show appreciation by taking you two out for dinner?", "NTA. A gift with strings attached is not a gift", "Broke parties broke the implied social rules, but a gift being yours to do what makes you happiest seems more important in this case.\n\nFor all you know she wasn't that interested in that band anymore and the money is going to be used for something she enjoys more.\n\nNTA", "NTA. A gift, freely given, ls the recipients to do with as they wish.", "NTA. Also your sister is not an A H neither because she show gratitude for the gift and did nothing wrong.", "NTA...  your reasoning is spot on.  And, how does your GF know that your sister didn't appreciate the gift?  I'm sure she appreciated it, but also appreciated the opportunity to make some money and take you two to dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry but that\u2019s a super shit thing to do. I would be pissed too.", "NTA, but your sister sure is. I suggest not giving her any more valuable presents.", "*Especially* since gf waited to say anything until they were alone. She didn't make a scene or anything, just voiced her disappointment.", "Yes exactly this!!! And she obviously made a lot more money than the treat she gave to OP and his gf. Gf's emotions are totally justified especially when she was kind and caring enough to initiate to contribute for the gift. The sister comes off as a little selfish, even after the dinner gesture. OP could've been more understanding of his gf's POV and not completely negated it.", "Yes lol.

One, because your sister is so crass, and two because you back your sister being crass.", "You\u2019re sister is the AH, dick more on her part", "NTA\n\nYou are spot on. When you give a gift you let go of it 100% and it is theirs to do with it what they see fit.", "NTA.  once a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient.  What they do with it is up to them.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. My feelings are echoed by the top comment.", "NTA bruh, your sister taking to you to a nice dinner is a sign of showing appreciation. Actions talk louder than words bruh.", "I'm going with NAH but slightly Y T A. Your girlfriend is right about the gift and appreciation; however, you also are correct that after giving the gift, the recipient (your sister) can do what they want with the gift. Did you not feel disappointment that your sister took $$$ instead of being grateful for the consideration and thoughtfulness that you and your GF put into the gift?\n\nOP, replace CONCERT TICKETS with JEWELRY. Would you still feel the same?\n\nBut OP, don't be surprised that in the future, your GF just says GIFT CARDS for any future gifts.", "Absolutely NTA. A gift given should never come with expectations. Once it\u2019s given, it\u2019s up to the recipient to do with it what they please. The GF is wrong wrong wrong.", "She sold one ticket out of two right?  What was she supposed to do with the other ticket,  bring a friend I assume\n\n\nWell a friend is still going and she made a profit.  What's the big deal?", "NTA your gf is stupid ignore her", "You're fine. You just had a disagreement. Or was it actually an angry argument?", "NTA and she took both of you for dinner, so she is NTA either", "NTA", "You nailed it, once a gift is given you have zero say in what happens to it or how it's used.  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nand argument not very immportant, dont worry OP.", "NTA you\u2019re right she does in fact do what she wants with a gift she gets, it\u2019s her choice. Plus she obviously wouldn\u2019t have done it /told you about it if she didn\u2019t know the reaction she\u2019d get from you would be good.", "When you give a gift, walk away, your part is done. 6x the price is a great deal . It\u2019s never a good idea to have imaginary strings attached. NTA.", "Plus, the sister may be using the money her friend gave her to save for college, a car, rent, something else she needs. I'd be curious to know how much the original ticket was and whether OP was exaggerating about the friend offering 6 times it's worth.", "NAH.  It was hers to use as she wished. However, I\u2019d give her low effort gifts going forward.  Here\u2019s a gift card that I picked up at the supermarket.", "I think the sister is an asshole. Sure its \"practical\" to sell a ticket for a higher price. But gifts have a sentimental component and concert tickets aren't about practicality.\n\nIt's basically spitting in the gift givers face to show off about how you turned a profit on the gift. At least be discreet if you are going to be this mercenary.\n\nIf I was GF, I would just give sis checks for all future gifts since money is her main priority. She can invest it in her scalping operation if that's how she wants to play things.", "They were inevitably going to ask if she enjoyed the concert. It was better to be up front and explain what happened and why she made that decision, rather than lie.", "Honestly. When you gift someone an experience such as a concert, there is an unspoken rule that the person who received the gift return with fun, or at least interesting stories to share with those who gave the gift. If I give someone a trip to Italy, I expect them to return with photos and stories to share with me. When this is done it can really further bond the two parties, and I don't doubt that's the outcome the girlfriend was hoping for, and rightfully so I would think. So her disappointment is more than understandable. While your sister made the practical decision, it may not have been the right one. I anticipate your girlfriend will only gift cash or giftcards to your sister moving forward, if she gifts her anything at all.", "There is no person alive who gives gifts with no strings attached. For example if you gave me a gift and in response I did not thank you, would you feel slighted? Most would, and rightfully so. An expectation of gratitude is \"strings\". What if I not only did not thank you but spat in your face, insulted the person dearest to you, and broke the gift right in front of you? Would you be upset? Of course you would, and rightfully so. Again though these are \"strings\". Gifts, indeed all interaction is by nature transactional, even if the expectations are extremely low. If you do not follow on your end of this transaction there will be consequences, whether that be a confrontation or simply the person never gifting you anything again. These are \"strings\" and that's okay.", "It makes sense that he and his sister would have a similar POV on the relative value of the money vs the experience. Growing up with any level of financial hardship or scarcity can do that\u2026 \n\n\nFor example, my mother stiII can\u2019t drop it that my husband and I spent \u201ctoo much\u201d on our wedding. It\u2019s been ages and she\u2019ll still lament the waste, like, \u201cthat could have been a new car\u2026 a down payment on a house.. \u201c Doesn\u2019t matter that we own our house, we have cars. It\u2019s like she can\u2019t conceptualize that sometimes when you have enough money, experiences can be more valuable. Like, you\u2019ll pay more to avoid a hassle, or have a nicer experience, and you aren\u2019t having to choose or sacrifice to do it. \n\n\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just very hard for some people based on how they were raised. The money will always feel like it\u2019s worth more.", "It\u2019s like y\u2019all enjoy giving people bad advice", "True. It takes a really special kind of asshole to make a scene over this type of situation.", "I don't agree with you. She took them all out to dinner on her dime as a thank you for the gift. Which she paid for with the funds that came from it. Sister had an opportunity to make money and then shared it with those who put her in that position. I'm going NAH. Gf is absolutely entitled to feel like the gift wasn't wanted. Brother knows once a gift is given its done. And the Sister brought them all out to celebrate. I am kinda wondering if bro and sis grew up in a family that had to make sacrifices for money. It would absolutely explain the behavior", "One other thing that isn't fully explained is also the \"sweat equity\" that OP and his GF put into getting the tickets. If they spent 6 hours in line to fight the horde to get the tickets, I could see why they/she would be pissed that she turned around and sold them so readily. I'd take it as the same sort of rejection as working hard to find someone a specific special gift and then seeing at the local thrift store. If they just purchased them online, hard to be really pissed because all that was invested was money.\n\nThis is also predicated on the sister *really* wanting to go to this specific concert. If the concert was good seats but kind of generic, it's way less surprising she sold them for profit.", "NAH but accept it if your GF gives more generic, low effort gifts going forward so it stings less next time. While it is true the gift is the recipient's to do what she wants with, it's also true that it had an intended destination.", "NTA. If I gifted someone a nice jacket or some headphones they wanted for Christmas, and they decide to sell it for some extra money, I'd not give them valuable gifts anymore. Gifts are about the sentimental and experiential value, and represent nice thoughts and are meant to be received with appreciation. The way your sister immediately took the deal isn't very nice, and I completely understand the gf's point of view. It was sweet of her to take you to dinner, but it'd rub me the wrong way if someone cashed out a gift like that, so I wouldn't go so far as to say any of you are AHs.", "Brother is the one who had the idea and it reads as though he did the purchasing(the work) while gf chipped in possibly after he had bought them. He is fine with what went down and sister brought them out to dinner as a thank you.  Your gf can be disappointed but you are NTA.", "I think your sister is TA here for selling a gift. She had a good opportunity to get more money but she should consider that it is a gift. She should respect that it an experience you and your gf wants to give her and i appreciate your gf for talking about her disappointed personally with you. You are right about saying that after giving the gift it is her choice to use it as her wish but you could be supportive to your girlfriend's disappointment since she contributed for the gift too.", "NAH.\n\nI can see why your gf is upset, and I can see why your sister would sell it. And you're right that she did take you out to a nice meal to \"pay you back\" in a sense.", "NAH\n\ni can see why GF is annoyed but it seems she handled it well - talking to you instead of making your sister feel bad.  Meanwhile your sister showed her appreciation for your role in her good fortune by taking you both out to a nice dinner.", "NAH\n\nYour gf never made a scene and she didn\u2019t want to ruin your sister\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s choice on what to do with the ticket. So there\u2019s nothing really wrong, it\u2019s just an unfortunate situation is all.", "I think your sister is ta here.", "YTA well, your sister is for selling an expensive, thoughtful gift and then rubbing it in your faces with the meal. It maybe would've been slightly better if she'd paid you guys back but she didn't. Really crass behaviour", "NTA because your girlfriend inserted herself into the gift giving. Your original plan was to buy the tickets yourself. You wouldn't care if your sister sold them. Girlfriend is creating drama.", "If your sister had explained the situation and checked with you before selling I would say NAH. As it is, while she was technically correct- it is her gift to dispose of- I would personally be hurt by this.", "Hmm, this is a tough one. I'd go with NAH. They're both right", "Your sister is an asshole, and so are you for backing her up. Neither of you clearly have any class if you're perfectly fine with this behaviour. YTA.", "YTA. I think sister was in the wrong, it wasn\u2019t a cheap gift and it was intended as a gift not an investment opportunity. I would be annoyed too.", "I felt the feels of this situation when the PS5 came out. My nephew asked for one for combined Christmas/birthday gift from his parents. (My budget was significantly lower.) I stalked every online site to try and get one every single day. After weeks of trying, I managed to snag one at Best Buy at 2:30 in the morning. I woke up specifically to look for this sale. He was stalking the same sale but didn\u2019t score one. I let him know that I got it so he didn\u2019t waste any more time looking.\n\nDuring his trip back to uni after the turkey holiday, a guy sitting near him heard that he was getting one for Christmas. The guy offered him over twice the retail price for the PS5. His mother thought he should sell it and was sure that inventory would be better in the spring when his birthday came around. I was livid. I had spent HOURS trying to get the only thing her son asked for.  I could have used the money - way more than them - but it was a labor of love, not money.\n\nThe fact that he was the only one of his friends to score the new PS5 was too tempting and he decided that he would keep it. Good thing, or I might have sold it myself since I hadn\u2019t even picked it up yet.\n\nConcert tickets can also be time consuming to purchase. Specific release times, logging in online, electronic wait list that you or may not move from. It does sound like the brother expended that effort but I would still be disappointed.", "I get what you are saying, but it is pretty tacky to sell a gift.", "\"Gifts and invitations are not obligations\"\n\nEdit: might trademark that", "That's not the problem. Personally, I think NAH, because gf's view is just as valid: they gave a gift, not money, which has a sentimental value. Also, considering how hard it is to get concert tickets, they may have put in a lot of effort and thoughtfulness. Although, OP's view is also valid, but I feel like Sis's move was tacky.", "I don't think I know of any shows where you have to camp out at a venue to buy tickets.", "Yeah but that's the same scenario as knitting a sweater for somone and feeling entitled to be outraged when the receipient doesn't wear it because they think its ugly.   \n\n\nNot all of your gifts will be liked. You will get some wrong over the course of your stay on the planet Earth."]}
