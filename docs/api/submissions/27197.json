It is my dream job and I have worked my whole life for it. My mother wanted me to go into the military and I refused, so she spent my life telling me that my sister (25) was her favorite. So as soon as I turned 18 I moved out.\n\nFast forward a few years, my mother got into a wreck and passed away. My sister had to sell my mom's house since she never worked a day in her life so she had no money. My sister used all the money she got from the house to go on a month long trip in Europe. And when she got back I took pity on her and took her in.\n\nMy sister was incredibly depressed and wouldn't eat, wouldn't shower, wouldn't leave her room for WEEKS. I decided to check on her at least a few times a week and once I walked into her attempting. I immediately took her to the hospital and she was admitted for 3 weeks before she was released back to me. And this is the start of a cycle.\n\nAbout a month later I was running late for work but she said she was having dark thoughts so I called my boss and then took my sister to the hospital again. I have taken her to the psychiatric hospital about five times in the past 6 months. I don't mind helping her get through this, but she won't get help. She refuses to go to an actual therapist and just goes to the psychiatric hospital whenever she feels the thoughts coming back. \n\nI have put her on my insurance and had them mail me a list of psychiatrists and she refuses to look at it. I have had to miss a week's worth of work because she tells me in the morning while I'm on my way to work that she's having dark thoughts. I am being run thin emotionally and financially trying to help her. \n\nAnd about a week ago I shamefully blew up on her. My boss told me that he can't afford for me to keep taking off work and I 100% understand because I can't afford it either. So I set my sister down and told her that she needs to get a psychiatrist because I can't keep doing this with her. And quite literally the very next day as I'm getting into my car she comes running out crying that today is the day she might do something to herself and that I need to take her to the hospital immediately before she does. \n\nI got out of my car and I just yelled at her that I can't do this anymore and that I'm going to lose my job and that she needs to look at the list because I am no longer going to be her chauffeur to the hospital. And then I went to work and while I was there I had family I didn't even know existed messaging me on Facebook about how horrible I am. \n\nWhen I got home my sister admitted to reaching out to extended family. And after reading all of my family's messages I'm genuinely wondering if I am the jerk. A few of the family members thinks I need to get a job that keeps me closer to home so I can help her through this. Is that really what family does? \n\nSo, AITA for this?", "created_utc": 1695136496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mtpvy/aita_for_saying_enough_is_enough_with_my_sister/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not within your power to prevent your sister from harming herself.  Ultimately that is something only you can do.  Nor will will you be able to do anything for her if she refuses.\n\nYears ago I stood in a hospital corridor and refused to take my sister home.  I believed that if I took her home the pattern of her ignoring all medical advice and trips to the ER would continue.  I told them that if they thought it was safe to send her home they were the ones who had to do it because I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nOnce they agreed to find a nursing home until I could find assisted living for her (she had both physical and mental issues).  The I did the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  I told my sister that if she didn\u2019t agree I would walk out that door and not see her again.  That I would also go to court and petition them to make me her guardian.  She was so angry at me but she agreed.  She didn\u2019t know that I cried outside in the hall.  That I was shaking as I gave the ultimatum.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy and we still had crisis after crisis.  She ended up in assisted living for 13 years.  She told me sometime after how grateful she was that I made her do it.  That she knew that without my intervention she would in all likelihood have died.  She felt safe and taken care of.  \n\nThere came the day she needed emergency surgery which did not go well, no one\u2019s fault her body just just couldn\u2019t take it.  \n\nShe spent  the last 3 years of her life in a nursing home where they took wonderful care of her.  She died in 2019 and I miss her everyday.\n\nNone of that wouldn\u2019t have happened if I hadn\u2019t stopped the endless round of ER visits and hospitalizations.  Most importantly she was able to spend another 18 years in a safe and living environment.  I have no regrets, there was literally no other options.

I don't even know how she found them because our mother told us nothing about our father and said she herself aged out of foster care. So this whole situation has my mind numb.", "Is there a way to do this without her actually losing her mind and doing something to herself? That's all I'm worried about. I don't want to kick her out and then boom, she's gone. And I'm the last person who could've done something.", "I\u2019d drop her off at their house with her box if crap.", "Your mom may have told her info that she didn't tell you. Your sister may have also done DNA testing with one of those family tree sites and not told you about it.\n\nIf I'm being cheeky, I'd say invite some of those random family members to come pick her up and take her in. If they think you're being so horrible, they're welcome to take over caring for her. They will probably decline, because it's easier to talk the talk than it is to walk the walk.\n\nMore seriously, consider getting connected with a therapist for yourself, if you don't have one yet. That might help you process what you've been dealing with so that you're feeling less numb.", "In that case, the opinions of the random relatives are irrelevant.\n\nYou\u2019re a good sister for helping her through her mental struggles, but you don\u2019t have to let her manipulate and control you.", "If they are so concerned she can move with them and refuse help. It\u2019s one thing to need help but it\u2019s another yo make you in charge of her mental health. Tell her if she does not choose a counseled and take charge of her own health then to get someone  else to play ambulance. Harsh but something has to change", "Family is so important, then where have they been? Are they going to pay for her? House her? Ruin their lives for her? Cut yourself loose. NTA unless you stay", "She is using your guilt to manipulate you. She is not doing even a minimum of effort after all you have been doing for her. And guess what? You are NOT the last person \"who could've done something\" - SHE is.", "NTA. You are understandably at the end of your rope because you've rescued her numerous times and she just keeps going back to being a dependent child in an adult's body.  She IS CAPABLE of learning right?  I mean if she has a developmental disability like Down's Syndrome where mentally she will never age above 8 years old, then you may be on the hook here.  It doesn't sound like this is what is happening here. \n\nShe obviously HAS a will to live, that's why she's performing this act.  If she goes and gets your attention every time, those dark thoughts are NOT taking her over.  I say this because I have been at the place with those dark thoughts EVERY. DAY. OF. MY. LIFE. and I never told a soul that every morning when I woke up I wanted to not be here. Because I felt like **nobody** would have understood how dark the world actually looked to me in that state.  It's not something you run around broadcasting.  It is a deeply painful, isolating and disturbing existence that you just quietly wish would end, it's not something you WANT to share because you feel so isolated, you feel ashamed, you feel guilty for not wanting to participate, you feel like nobody can understand the deep pain and disconnection you feel to EVERY single person, place or thing in your life.  That type of pain isn't something you'd wish upon your worst enemy, so of course you won't burden your loved ones with it because why would you want THEM to feel this utter despair and ennui that encompasses and colors every single interaction or lack thereof, every moment of every single day.  It's an inner pain and inner mental life that is so full of wanting to be completely VOID of anything.  One feels hollow, and totally disconnected.  If someone looks relaxed, you don't notice, but if someone looks happy, it just makes one's own darkness and despair even worse when you didn't think it was possible to feel worse.   It doesn't sound like this is what she is experiencing.  I have never known anyone in the midst of a severe, debilitating, sui##dal  mental crisis to create drama and reach out to numerous people to cause an uproar over one person not being \"supportive\".  All the people I've known in that state are OVER IT when it comes to expressing emotional collapse and a desire to un alive themself, they simply don't have the ENERGY or fortitude required to create that type of family drama, or put forth the effort needed to make others feel guilty or manipulate someone to \"help them\" by providing for all their essential needs and wants.  A person suffering like that is more shut down and inactive than getting up and running around crying to everyone that they can find to listen.  When the will to live is gone, so is the will for creating drama and trying to get people in an uproar.   Desire, care and self-importance is GONE then.\n\nThis appears to be text book manipulative behavior for certain personality disorders.  Talking about \"doing oneself in\" to a wide and varied audience is PERFORMATIVE behavior in and of itself, which in turn creates a guilt spiral for the loved ones of the person suffering from mental un-wellness.  In short, she is likely not seriously considering it and is pretty much using YOU as her emotional support animal.  When one is actually in that state, the LAST THING one wants is their loved ones to feel bad, because they feel like all the bad emotions of the world reside in their heart and mind and wouldn't want ANYONE to feel as bad as they do.  That's why I think this is a performance and not genuine. \n\nShe needs to learn to manage her own emotions and behavior and you continuing to **rescue her** EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. she comes crying about a break down or worse is **NOT HELPING** HER.  You have to cut her off so that she will ACTUALLY ATTEMPT to get the help she needs.  Granted, when you did catch her that time, she may have been making an attempt, but from the history you have described, it really looks like she doesn't intend to do it, she just wants you to BELIEVE she will, so she performs appropriately when she knows you will be her audience.  \n\nWhat is best for your sister is to disengage from you and learn to stand on her own two feet and start taking responsibility for her own life, self care and career.  Your mom didn't do her any favors by coddling her and not teaching her to be self sufficient.  It's super hard that she grew up not learning how to actually BE an adult and do adult things like care for herself, and kept her shielded from the consequences of her actions and inactions.  However, since she doesn't know HOW to adult, she MUST LEARN now.  She has no more parachute or giant air mattress to fall back on now that your mom is gone.  \n\nYou cannot live her life for her. You have already gone ABOVE AND BEYOND what is necessary to try to help her, but she is refusing to actually ACT.    \n\nHopefully, you can maybe get her into a treatment program that will help her mental health and also help her to learn life skills while she is there.  Once she graduates from a program (think something like a group home for disabled adults, because she is in fact disabled at the moment because she was never taught to care for herself and how to function in the real world), then you can help her out with making sure she has the things she needs to move forward.  If you can find a program like that, they will likely begin to engage you and get you involved in her rehabilitation at some point.  Make no mistake, she needs rehabilitation in order to learn the things she should have learned while growing up, and it's going to be hard work.  You CAN be there for her at a later point.  For now, she's going to have to make those first steps by herself once she understands she can't coast through life dependent on another person's good will.  She needs to actually WORK at improving her lot in life.  If she isn't willing to do so, I'm afraid she's a lost cause.  That is NOT YOUR FAULT.  You managed to grow up to be self sufficient, so that tells you that the lessons COULD have been taught/learned but for whatever reasons, obviously, were not.  That part isn't really her fault that much, but it will be in the future if she keeps on like she is. \n\nSorry it's so long.  Good luck to you and your sister. I really hope she gets the help she needs. Please don't feel badly, you've done what you could.", "Your sister had enough resources not to do herself in when you told her to handle herself; she managed to deal with her mental health crisis by calling relatives to badmouth you. She's more capable than she's letting on. Just saying.", "The person who needs to do something is her. Do not set yourself on fire to keep her warm. I went through this with my mom. Take care of yourself first. She's an adult and she needs to start acting like one.", "TBH it doesn't sound like she's really in danger of harming herself. Like other people have said, when you laid down that ultimatum she didn't actually hurt herself\u2014instead she told a bunch of people about how you wouldn't do something for her. I'm no psychiatrist, but it sounds like she's threatening to harm herself for the attention she gets from you. It may be that this is the only area in which she feels she has any control or any number of other things, but regardless her behavior is completely unfair. It's time for an ultimatum. Either she actually goes to therapy and works on her issues, or she moves out. She's an adult, it's been plenty long enough of mooching off family, now she has to put in an effort. Depression is hard, grief is hard, but her mental health is her responsibility. Not yours, no matter how badly you feel for her.", "I agree that this is a concern, but you need to sit her down and discuss the realities of both of your situation. Your job pays for both of you to have shelter, food, and insurance. If you lose your job then any stability either of you have goes away. Find a time to have this conversation with her when she isn't in crisis, when you both have time to sit down and discuss it in depth. Offer to recruit some of this mysterious extended family to come and keep her company when you aren't home. \n\nI don't doubt that her struggles are real, and that the 'convenient' timing of her crises always happening just as you are leaving might be because of separation anxiety/abandonment issues due to your mom's death. But the solution for that isn't to quit your job, that will only make her more dependent on your presence and won't be a viable long term solution.", "you could make attending regular therapy a condition of staying with you. if she won\u2019t do that, there really isn\u2019t anything you can do. being repeatedly suicidal like this and refusing actual help is less a major depressive symptom and more a cry for attention. if she is majorly depressed and suicidal and refuses medical help eventually she will succeed, no matter what you do. if it\u2019s a cry for attention she may not ever seriously attempt it. (the fact that you walked in on her could be poor or very good planning on her part.) that said, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s on me or you to armchair diagnose her, and whatever the case is she is seriously mentally ill and needs psychatric help, so i do think you should make therapy a condition for staying and if she refuses call the hospital you\u2019ve been taking her to and talk about the pattern of behaviour from her and the impact on you, tell them you can\u2019t help her anymore and that she refuses therapy and ask about involuntary commitment. nta.", "Get her back into the hospital under psychiatric care, and then don't be her \"out\" to come home.  Once she is in, she can no longer come back to your house.  If she doesn't have a safe place (with family) to watch over her, they will likely keep her longer, and get her onto medication.", "No, there really isn't.  Not unless she gets put under an involuntary long term hold.  But also...  it's not your responsibility to keep anyone living if they don't want to keep living.  That's an impossible task and it is incredibly unfair to put it on to yourself and even more unfair to think you could actually do such a thing.  You can't.  No one can.\n\nYour sister is an adult.  She is a whole person outside of you and you have no real control over her.  You can only control yourself, what energy you put into things, and how long you let her continue to torture you.\n\nAnd I hate to say it, but people who want to die, they die.  People who want to manipulate, like it seems your sister likes to do, do it until you advocate for your own health and well-being.  They destroy what they touch and you shouldn't feel bad for getting out of the path.\n\nAlso, next time a \"family member\" comes out of the woodwork, make sure to get their address and stick your sister in the next Uber right to their doorstep.", "Yeah ignore the soap box comments from the peanut gallery. They aren't interested in actually helping they just want to save the day from afar by judging everyone else.", "Sister?", "She didn\u2019t stop showering until she got home from vacation. Interesting. \ud83e\udd14", "Oh right. Fixed it."]}
