As you said, the field is competitive - they'd find those penguins an eager replacement.\n\nI'm a zookeeper and your issue is common though, I think. There tends to be a culture of \"never complain about the grossness\" at zoos but if you go on zookeeper FB groups or even subreddits, it's very common to see \"how do I keep everything I own from smelling?\" questions, with the answers tending to be laughter and \"you don't!\"\n\nI know it can be a tough adjustment but it might help to be able to talk to your friend openly about your concern and see what she thinks.

Many (most?) keepers deal with this to some degree or another.\n\nWho do you think has it better? Big cat keepers? That smell is utterly vile, as you mention. Small mammals? Be thankful penguins don't produce musk. That truly won't come off, as a fox-keeper friend of mine knows. Hoofstock? Man, elephant smells are strong too.\n\nThere are ways to cope and deal with it and it should continue becoming easier over time.

And not something to fully embrace as part of your love for animals.\n\nI know this sounds wild. Zookeepers tend to be a pretty crazy bunch. But the long-time ones I've been around all mostly see it this way, I think. If you see this aspect of your animals as something nasty and gross to talk about and to be avoided, you're in for a lifetime of frustration.\n\nReal conversation between two coworkers just a while back in the break room. One reeks of tomcat spray stronger than I think I've ever smelled in my life, lol:\n\n**A**: Oh, whew, B, did (lion) hose you down again?\n\n**B**: (Laughing, smiling) Yep, got me square in the chest. \n\n**A**: (laughing) Twice in one week, congratulations.

But if you can move past the negative emotions associated with them totally then you'll be One Of Us! Just think, everyone smells like something. Most people have to smell like lame humans but you get to smell like a penguin! How cool is that? Right? right?", "Two things,\n1 - talk to your friend about how you\u2019re feeling, and maybe discuss the smell stuff with your colleagues, maybe they just need to push to let go about how they feel about the stink. Having people you can vent to at work is a key part of any workplace imo. \n\n2 - maybe see what the next role will be? Could you ask to move to a different animal, as a secondment perhaps, and see if you have the same reaction. You said you did the farm work so maybe land animals would be easier for you?\n\nEither way, NTA, but don\u2019t surprise your friend with this by suddenly announcing you\u2019re leaving, that would be the part that hurt.", "NTA, sometimes it just doesn't work out and if you want to save face with both your friend and the zoo is to be honest and say it's too much.  That's not a normal job, it definitely takes a certain type and I'm sure the people who have been doing that for awhile understand that.\n\nI worked an atypical job.  I built cellphone towers.  A person sees the pictures and amazing views and says I want to give that a shot.  Yeah heights become very real very fast when you start.  But I never thought down of people who couldn't do it and I'll give them respect for even trying.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you gave it a solid try, and things just aren't working out.

Sounds like you did the prep and went in eyes wide open but the reality and impact on your life were just different than you expected. That\u2019s not your fault. Loose analogy I always thought I\u2019d be a good doctor or nurse. Zero issues with body functions and smells, I love seeing surgeries, tried to watch as much of my own c sections as I could, etc. Then last year my cat started needing daily analgesic injections. I was like yeah no problem. Turns out I can\u2019t do it. Lol my ex has to do it.", "YWBTA if you quit after only 4 months.

And see this as a good thing you ended up not liking one job so now you can find something else.", "NAH you are unhappy and you do not have to stay where you are unhappy. But is your friend or another keeper available so you can be honest and talk to somebody in person? It might help to have a friend in person who understands the whole situation and can make you feel more supported. I think unless you are absolutely miserable maybe stick it out for a full 6 months and then after that if you are still unhappy, feel good that you gave it a try and it is not for you.", "Thanks. It feels good to know I'm not the only one struggling with this.\n\nIt feels hard to bring up because I would feel so stupid saying \"I sacrificed years of my life trying to become a zookeeper but then I quit because penguins are smelly.\" Who does that? I feel like I'm being stupid about all this.", "When I got my first zoo job 20 years ago there was even a question on the application about ranking your ability to deal with smells, 0 to 10. It had a note \"Be prepared to prove it at your interview if you select 10,\" or something like that.\n\nBeing the self-sure youngster I was, I put 10.\n\nPart of my interview was ten feet downwind of the dumpster they shovel the big cat waste into. Heaps and heaps of lion waste and old meat. I could barely hear myself think to answer the questions. I thought my **brain** was melting it was so bad.\n\nSomehow I didn't puke, and thus began my career working with big cats.", "Oh they did, at least to some degree. Maybe they figured the farm internship would help prepare me. But they asked me in the interview how I think I'd cope with the nastiness of the job, part of the interview was conducted in the just-before-cleaning-time sea lion enclosure when the stench was the strongest, and the practical part of the interview involved a senior keeper showing me the fecal lab and going through the fecal analysis process for a sample of seal feces, and then testing my knowledge of the process afterwards. Made me almost hurl but I got through it.\n\nI'm fine with that stuff, really, I have a strong stomach I think, or I'd never have gotten through the first month. Now I'm sort of nose-blind to it, at least in a sense. \n\nBut others aren't. I didn't expect it to be this pervasive as a permanent part of my life. People give me weird grossed out looks when I walk into a store. Some old friends don't seem to want to hang out anymore. Maybe it's just a bit of a shock to me and will take some getting used to...I dunno.", "Man, this is a sobering thread to read as someone studying to be a zookeeper. The smell gets brought up a lot but I sort of laugh it off. I mean I've been to the zoo and sure, it smells, but not in a...life-ruining sort of way. But behind the scenes...maybe it's way worse. **shudder**\n\nJust how bad does it get, I wonder? And why is OP finding it impossible to wash off even after work? I also am doing farm volunteering currently, mucking cow barns, and it stinks bad, but I got over it and now it doesn't bother me anymore! I thought that was a good sign for being a zookeeper...but yikes, people are acting like that barely even registers on the zookeeper smell-o-meter!", "I do think the op was completed deluded about being a zoo keeper though. Did she think, like a five-year-old would, that it was all cuddling fluffy baby animals? She sounds like someone who wants to be a nurse then is stunned that bodily fluids of patients are involved.", "> Small mammals? Be thankful penguins don't produce musk.\n\nIs the musk really a bigger deal than the poo, though? How so?", "That's not fair, she spent a lot of time interning and thought she would like it. She wouldnt have wasted all that time if she was on the fence about it, but things change. TONS of people change their minds about interests the longer they do it.", "You KNEW penguins were smelly. You KNEW zoos were smelly. Everyone knows these things.\n\nWhat you DIDNT know is how constantly smelling would affect your mental health. You DIDNT know how much youd grow to hate the stench, how no matter how much you shower, you STILL smell like animals. How going in public would feel, knowing you cant quit remove the smell. How waking up and putting on smelly clothes to get in your smelly car to drive to your smelly job would make you feel awful. You cant fault yourself for the things you didnt know! \n\nWe all live and learn, just have an honest talk with your friend and make sure you tell her you're grateful for all her help and this was an important step in your journey but that your mental wellbeing is being hurt by this occupation. A good friend will understand", "Nursing is another profession that requires years of specialized training and is unpleasant in ways that sound obvious going in. A third to half of new grad nurses leave the field within two years.  \n\nSo \"who does that?\" A lot of people, apparently!  \n\nI think you should do your best, give it a few more months, keep researching to see if there's any less smelly roles this experience qualifies you for -- I had friends who worked with lab reptiles who never smelled, maybe a job like that would be an option? But if it turns out there isn't anything, well, careers are full of strange twists and turns. When you have a bad day at a future job at least you can look back and go, \"well, at least I don't smell like otters.\"", "I mean pervasive scent is one of the reasons we could never farm pigs, not even as a secondary job. Some of those farms pay really well but it\u2019s not enough to make up for the smell. Same with industrial turkey or chicken farms. I don\u2019t even like having just a few pigs on our farm when we\u2019ve raised them for a CSA. You can hardly escape it. Free range/pasture and rotational movement helps. Is there a career path laid out for you at the zoo that would let you switch areas?\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unreasonable to switch careers. You can be grateful to your friend for the opportunity while also understanding that opportunity has taught you what you don\u2019t want out of life, and move on from there.", "You definitely need some sort of behind the scenes exposure to really grasp how bad the smell is - does your local zoo have volunteer opportunities? To be honest, farmyard animal smells are nothing compared to zoo/wild animal smells. Cows smell genuinely pleasant compared to something like piles of seal shit.", "Well, I had volunteered at a farm, doing dirty, smelly work, for almost a year before the zoo job. I wasn't under the impression it'd be petting fluffy animals.\n\nIt's just that at the farm, I could shower after work and then live my life. Here, it feels like that just...doesn't work. No amount of showering removes the smell.", "100% this", "Musk is a very strong smell and it lingers", "Could have just volunteered. Its like learning how to swim on the internet. Give it a try before you make serious decisions. Hope OP learnt from this experience.", "Oh, interesting. Thanks for the insight. Is there a reason that it smells so much worse behind the scenes? Just closer proximity? Same \"zoo\" smell but stronger or it's worse than just that?\n\n>Cows smell genuinely pleasant compared to something like piles of seal shit.\n\nFrom diet mostly? I would think seal poo might be a bit gnarlier but I thought the cows could make up for that with sheer volume! But perhaps it doesn't work that way. You've been around seals yourself?", "If you could move to herbivores, particularly the ungulates you might find the smell is better (I'm guessing that's why the farm was better). Carnivores are just smellier and like to scent things... And that stuff is designed to stick.", "Yeah but I feel like that\u2019s very commonly brought up as a con of that job. Like I know that, and I\u2019ve never worked in zookeeping nor do I know anyone who does. It just gives the impression that maybe you didn\u2019t research this career path all that thoroughly.", "Could you ask the zoo if you could rotate to another animal? Like every month or so, everyone could rotate, not only for the experience, but just to mix things up so every day isn't the EXACT same.", "Yeah but she needed a job. If she already had a stable job and thought hey maybe I want to be a zookeeper then yeah sure, volunteering wouldve been the way to go. But she needed a stable career, did the work to get said career, and has changed her mind, which is completely fine to do.", "Herbivore poop doesnt tend to smell that bad (at least in terms of what Ive smelled), but carnivore poop is absolutely vile. It doesnt just smell \"bad,\" but its eye-wateringly strong and incredibly overpowering. Thats why zookeepers talk about smelling bad all the time - it seeps into you. Big cats AFAIK are notorious for that. \n\nMy exposure to seals comes from wild seals rather than zoo animals, but yeah, it is AWFUL. On the island where I was working, if the wind was blowing the wrong way, all you could smell was seal shit. So vile from a distance, and somehow it managed to be even worse of you stumbled onto fresh shit. I think it was the second worst thing Id ever smelled in my life.", "Well people say farmwork is stinky too, so I don't think it was so out of left field for OP to extrapolate that to the zoo work. At least I wouldn't have expected it to be so bad that showering thoroughly and changing clothes after work doesn't work enough since I worked in smelly fields too and that has been sufficient with them. Sometimes you have to really do the stuff to really understand. \n\nAnd to OP: you're NTA if you change your field again. I think you're friend will understand if she is really a friend and wants you to be happy and content in life.", "The smell is in your nose most likely, not actually on you. You literally need to wash the inside of your nostrils with soap or shampoo because the fats get stuck in your nose hairs. Then saline rinse your sinuses. Use enzyme based detergent to immediately soak your clothes. Then coat the inside of your nose with a thin layer of Vicks vapor rub. Put an open container of coffee grounds in your car to absorb odors.\n\nYou're likely also using the wrong products to break down the smells. Unscented or citrus scented products work best IMO. Scented laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets trap stinky smells in. You want to use an unscented enzyme based laundry detergent and a cup of white vinegar as a fabric softener, no GD dryer sheets. \n\nAlso, ask about trying a new animal group. Maybe the herbivores would work for you or the reptile house.", "YWNBTA - but if you do back out its an irrevocable step so maybe see if you can tolerate it a but more. Take more steps to keep job smells and normal people apart - always shower and change clothes completely at end of shift  - never get in your car in work clothes - spend more time with other people who have smelly jobs. Also talk to your friend.   \nit is a problematic job and probably takes about a year to get fully integrated - which for most people will happen (humans are very adaptable) and you actually only done a few months - but it\u2019s your mental health and if you show no sign of adapting completely then you need to do what is best for you.", "INFO\n\nDo you plan on paying that person back?  \n\nThey would be totally in the right to be upset if you used their money then dipped out.", "At the end of the day, there are other career options outside of zoos.

I worked mostly hoofstock, but moved into carnivore/primate later in my career. 100% NTA. I saw so many interns and newer keepers wash out early on for many of the reasons that you mentioned. It takes a special kind of crazy to have a camel regurgitate on you and still show up for work the next day to care for said camel. This career is more of a lifestyle, and it\u2019s not your fault that the field is so competitive that you \u201cplayed the game\u201d (used some connections) to get where you are. Have you considered trying the education or outreach department? You still do keeper stuff but it\u2019s generally lighter and you bring ambassador animals to schools and other events. Just a thought!", "NTA. You\u2019re you g and trying things out. But dont have 2nd thoughts- small community and word gets around. \nAnimals smell and it is not I common for ppl to get into animal-based careers and leave when they realise what it takes to keep these industries going\u2014 a lot of cleaning.", "NTA, and if you explain it to your friend I\u2019m sure she will understand!", "NTA. but I find it strange that there isn\u2019t some kind of rotation system at the zoo.

It's always harder to find a job when you are desperate. \n\nNTA", "NTA.   \n\n\nLook, what you want to do with your life is ultimately up to you. You can thank your friend for the wonderful opportunity, and be grateful, but you're not required to be in a position where you don't want to be, just because someone spent their time helping you get there. They weren't required to do so, just like you're not required to stay there.", "NTA, but you owe your friend an honest conversation about this before you just up and quit.\n\nLet me introduce you to a product that may change your life: [Biozet](https://www.biozetattack.com.au/product-information/), an Australian laundry detergent. You haven't said where in the world you are, but it should be possible for you to import some, and I've linked to a list of the active ingredients of it in case you want to compare for local equivalents.\n\nIts design specification is to eliminate odour-causing bacteria from cloth. It works in cold or hot water, though better in hot water. I was introduced to this stuff to remove cat pee smell from carpet in order to prevent the cat from peeing there again. Sprinkle some of the powder where the cat peed, wet it a bit, leave it for a while to dry, then clean it up. The cat themselves will not notice where they peed, and hopefully will not repeat the behaviour as cats so often do.\n\nI have since used it for towels left wet long enough to become mildew-smelling, and to remove dog poo, human vomit, human urine, possum spray, and a few other notably awful organic smells from surfaces and from clothing. It might solve your problem with the smells on your clothing, and potentially on your skin too if you use a bit of the powder to wash with.", "Before quitting. Her me out:\n\nYou seem to feel alone in your process.\n\nHave you tried to talk with the other zookeepers about it?

Don't quit without talking with your friend about it - and showing her how much you appreciated her efforts to help. If you quit, it will take a toll on your friendship on some way or another; she might be less willing to help again at another time.\n\nIf you quit without talking to her, you will make her feel that you didn't appreciate her help.", "NTA for a career change if only because it's your life and you are the one living it. However, I have to wonder if this is your MO by now. You went to college for something else, in your words not knowing what you want. Then, halfway through, you thought ZOO keeping might be more interesting and switched to that. And now that you are realizing the reality of that career path you are abandoning it for something else. **Considering your history, I would sit down and think long and hard on what you actually want to do with your life. If you are abandoning your career then at least be sure that it is for something you can stick to this time. Research it** **in person before you commit, not after the fact.**\n\nFor your question on why the junior keepers are given those jobs? Your post is kinda the reason why. Why invest in someone (training, time, and money) if they will fluff out the second they get to the smelly jobs? Better weed out the weaker candidates in the beginning and invest in those that remain. Logical, no?\n\nAs for your friend, I would feel guilty as well. You went into this with princess glasses and wasted both your and everyone else's time and effort. If you decide to leave, then all you can do is apologize now and make sure to repay her kindness in the future.", "I watched a docu somewhere that stated that these are reasons why specific jobs are given to the newbies. To weed out the ones who want to stay. NTA in the slightest. It just isn't for you, and if you stay any longer it really wouldn't be fair to someone else who would be perfect for the position.", "NTA\n\nNo job is worth your mental health, no favour anyone did you is worth your mental health.", "I think a lot of OP's problem stems from the social aspect, of old friends/randoms in public thinking they reek. Best way to deal with this in my opinion, is to hang out more with the coworkers, because they reek too. and they know the gig. Might help with the Mental Health aspect of the problems they're facing, and also see if this is something they want for life, if they can manage that. \n\nLike, OP if you have people who don't care what you smell like, and you still hate the job, quit. But also, have you discussed with your friend, your concerns? I don't think you'd be the asshole, although I think you might owe your friend one anyway lol, it's great that you had someone supportive for you.", "As a vet sci student, I could care less about the smell of organs etc. however, I walked past my med housemate watching an arm disection video and I nearly had a crisis, because I could never get past the fact that that is from an actual human being. Like, at this point I had done numerous sessions of disection on dogs, horse limbs, ruminants, etc. but an actual dead human being? No way, not in my life. Cadavers are just too far. (I also have this /thing/ about imaging of dead people, because the dead can't consent to publication of their image etc. and I would never want any aspect of my dead body photographed/video'd)  \nGoes to show, even if something is supposedly in your wheelhouse, doesn't mean it's the same or equivalent.   \nI will admit, I totally thought it was the norm for zoos to do a volunteer->career streamline, for this specific reason but maybe thats just where I live? as zoo keeping isn't a specific degree, usually people just start volunteering during their degree in animal sci/zoology/general science degree and eventually a role opens up/they know someone who knows someone and puts in a good word, etc. The only direct hire I've seen without a volunteering role, was from another (larger) zoo.", "Yes, definitely mention to the friend before deciding fully, even if you have decided, don't just spring this on them immediately before quitting. I also think OP should give it a bit longer or see if any other aspects of the job are better/theres other positions they'd prefer. I personally think there's a space between \"this aspect of my job sucks\" and 'definitely quit' that you have to explore, but personally I also feel like less than a year is definitely not long enough to settle into something", "I was thinking the same. OP NEEDS to have a decent stint at this job on their resume and a good reference from the employer, even if they move into a different field potential employers will want to see they're committed and want to hear positive things about them from previous employer.", "Google \"sunk cost fallacy\".", "Please do A LOT more research about all of this, especially since you're \\[already\\] studying to be a zookeeper and not just considering it (which would make more sense given how all these comments are surprising to you).\r  \n\n\n>and it stinks bad, but I got over it and now it doesn't bother me anymore!\r\n\nJust remember that, just like our own scents, when exposed to something enough, we become immune to it, but YOU WILL STILL REEK TO OTHER PEOPLE.

Digestion obviously isn\u2019t the same as rotting, but there does seem to be a pretty strong correlation between the smells.\n\nHerbivore waste isn\u2019t all that bad. There tends to be more of it, which can make the smell more powerful, but it\u2019s not terrible. \n\nOmnivore waste is worse. Think about the smell of dog poo or human poo as compared to cow poo. And if you\u2019re thinking that it\u2019s not really that bad, remember that, in a zoo, you\u2019d be talking about a MUCH greater volume than one dog or one human could produce. \n\nCarnivore waste usually smells awful, and piscivore waste is even worse. The smell gets into everything and is almost impossible to get rid of. \n\nTalk to some zookeepers in person. See if you can get a chance to volunteer at a zoo or aquarium or big cat/exotic animal rescue, etc. Yes, people joke about the smell thing, but it\u2019s real.", "There was a post on here a little while ago from a seasoned zookeeper asking if he was the asshole for not stopping to hose out a van mid-transport after a cheetah sprayed poop in it. He could cope but the other two less experienced keepers were vomiting from it. It sounds like a rough job", "Musk is essentially designed to reek and to last, and it does. In most animals it's either a defence mechanism or a territory warning, because it is potent, and long-lasting.", "Reminds me of when my friend Cecilie started working for the clown back in highschool. Nothing she did got the smell of fryer oil out of her hair and skin. Other kids mocked her for it, but she kept her head down and was the best burger flipper she could be. Here in Norway the clown paid well back then, and had excellent opportunities for moving up in thw system. She got promoted, and promoted again, and suddenly people weren't laughing at her anymore. She became franchise manager at 19 or 20 based solely on her being a beast who did everything in that place, as well as passing certain tests. I remember her studying for certifications with thick binders while ignoring a party going on around her, she was FOCUSED. After a couple of years she took the experience of that job and rolled it over into managing a hotel. Then she went and got her degree in hospitality and hotel management, all while having saved up enough to buy an apartment and a car (not cheap in Norway). The smell was temporary, but her success was permanent.", "> well, at least I don't smell like otters\n\nWhat's the meme about otters, is this a common thing/saying? I could have sworn I've heard \"at least it's not otters\" or something like that when keepers were discussing the smell of something before.\n\nI haven't met an otter keeper yet (perhaps I should be grateful?), but it's hard to imagine it could be worse than what I'm dealing with...", "Don't forget the puddles of 'zoo juice' from all the enclosure scrubbing that you have to walk through...", "I'm a nurse and I have been for awhile and I will say this, smells don't last forever. You eventually get used to them and desensitise to them. I've cared for people with chronic necrotic wounds for the past 3 years, and yeah it was difficult to stifle a gag reflex in the first few months, but now the stench doesn't bother me much, and I can actually use it as an asset to identify when a chronic wound has become infected based on the subtle changes in scent. If you truly love your job and the animals you care for then throw some vicks under your nose and grab some decent deodorant and persevere, eventually that smell may even become a comfort to you. But if the job really is no longer something you love and want to do then it's ok to say it's not for you and find something else that is, I've left jobs after 4 months before because I knew I couldn't love it, and I've never been happier than where I work now because of those decisions, but that's a decision you have to make, not a bunch of internet strangers XD", "Zoos are different from farms because you're going to be working with carnivores. That's why I agree with the other person that you didn't do anywhere near enough research. I, a random office worker, know that zoos are unbelievably stenchy places. Anyone with any interest on working in a zoo would have found it on their first five minutes of research.", "Penguins are particularly famous for their horrible smell. Maybe try working with different animals and see if it gets better. Give it at least another year or two, id say. Especially after putting in as much work as you have already. Life is long and you may actually love zookeeping if it isn't penguins.\n\nYou were right to notice how this job was open for a newbie. No one else wants it because penguins are a nightmare. They are cute but their stink is legendary.\n\nThis is NAH but I think if you give up completely you might... maybe...be the A H in the long run. Your instinct is right there. Best of luck as you decide!", "Is there a possibility to move to other animals that require a maintenance similar to a farm animal?", "Huh. Is it just like a stronger smell than cows, or what's so different about it?\n\nI never thought people would pass up lots of money because of a bad smell before. Makes me a little nervous to hear there are smells that bad out there, as a hopeful future zookeeper.", "Oh, I wasn't trying to put down what you're dealing with in any way. I meant more, like, a smelly work environment is challenging and it's totally reasonable to not want to deal with that. I think I mentally substituted seals for otters in your posts because I don't know what seals smell like but otters are fish-eating swimming mammals and I know how they smell and it's terrible.   \n\nGood luck with whatever you choose!", "I agree with this. I worked as a photography assistant at a zoo; the stink of the lions was horrible and would stick to my clothes even though we never touched them or entered the enclosure. Just being within a metre of the lions taking photographs was enough. Meanwhile, the rhino could take a huge dump and it was no worse than a large cow pat, and the ostriches and peacocks ran freely below the restaurant balcony and no complaints from patrons.", "Zoos intentionally put new keepers on the smelliest jobs to see if they can handle that very tough aspect of the career.  This initial posting is intended to wash out those who don't make the cut at the hardest jobs.  No sense putting time and money training someone on herbivores to find out they can't handle the piscivores and carnivores.\n\n Everyone wants the low stench gigs, but those go to senior staff who earned it.  An early transfer request will likely get OP gently redirected to consider another career path being a better fit.", "Just when I first adjusted to the cow-poo stench at the dairy I worked at, there was a severe case of black mastitis. Fully rotten, 1/4-1/3 of the udder was just... flesh strings. Now, I'm aclimatised to all sorts of smells, and the smell of cow pat gives me a familiar/nostalgia feel to it.   \nI can't say I've ever had a job that I /needed/ to leave after 4 months, but I've also never had a full-time job yet, just part-time whilst studying. But i feel like the way OP describes it, is that this job is viable in all other aspects. which makes me think maybe trying a bit longer might help? I also think that this, specific area of their job is not exactly a 'make or break' career type thing. Like, other areas or types of zoo job might be the perfect thing for OP. But you're right, no one here can actually tell OP what to feel, just what options there are.", "Oh gosh, monthly rotations? That's how long it takes most newcomers to stop wanting to hurl from the lion/tiger stench every time they have to clean.\n\nIt'd be impressively cruel to throw them to the seals/otters/monkeys just as soon as they were starting to stomach cat stink. Which makes me almost want to support it >:). Toughen those noses up.", "On she will in time. This first assignment is intended to weed out weak candidates. And as someone else mentioned, penguins are infamous for their stink.", "There\u2019s other reasons we have had not to take a job on a pig farm but chiefly that my DH found a better job but it was one we had to consider when he was hating his retail farm store job and needed out. We reeeeaaally didn\u2019t want to deal with the smell, and fortunately he found a much better option. \nBut even in smaller scale than cafo, some animal/husbandry smells just cling to you, to your hair, your body, your pores, your vehicle, anything that\u2019s parked nearby for shifts, comes home to your house\u2026 I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s worse. Many places will even have showering facilities onsite as part of the bio security practices but it doesn\u2019t seem fix the scent. I don\u2019t know the science behind why. I imagine that digestive systems play a role and manure management practices play a role. Ruminants like cattle and sheep handle their food differently than pigs and poultry and have differing common tactics to be dealt with and that can affect how much the ammonia etc are noticeable.", "That's so cool you got to work with wild seals! I'm jealous, haha. Maybe I wouldn't be if I smelled it. Were people throwing up, or it wasn't that bad?\n\nBut cats are pure carnivores too, right? And it seems like everyone can clean up cat poo (even with they miss the litterbox) without hurling. It's a different sort of smell than bigger cats though, or seals? Does the seal poo smell like fish from their diet or it's worse than just fishiness?", "Really? I'd never noticed an overwhelming smell from the guest area of the zoo with the big cats but maybe I wasn't close enough.\n\nHow long did it stick to you, even after showering? was it bad enough some of the photographers would gag or anything like that?\n\nWhat causes the \"big cat stink,\" is it just like a cat urine odor, or cat poo, or how would you describe what makes it so bad?", "There is a huge difference between cow/horse dung and penguin poop, at least. And I assume seals stink just as much.", "idk, unless that farmwork included pigs, I just don't think op was prepared for exactly how badly some scents can penetrate your being lol", "Have you ever smelled house cat poop? It's absolutely vile. I can't imagine what big cat poop smells like but I'm sure it would knock me out, and I have 4 cats!", "I think there's someone that actually works with big cats in the thread, but I think it's because of their body musk, that they mark everywhere especially on the fence line that we stood very close to, and also the meat which was stuffed into every tree for the lions to find. The musk odour must be volatile and was worse on hot days, 35C+. We were there everyday for feeding sessions. There were also several juvenile male lions and a secondary adult male lion in the pride - males are supposed to smell worse. Lucky for us we weren't physically touching the lions so showering and washing clothes was fine. Everything is outside so the smell wasn't concentrated.\n\nThe smell to me was nothing like a house cat. The smell was distinctly musky and meaty. They fed them kangaroo which has a very gamey smell. The job was 17 years ago but I still remember.", "At zoos I've been to, you could find the tiger area by smell alone, after a certain point. never been around lions but I imagine it's the same, if not worse. I'd say a combination of urine marking, and the inherent nature of carnivore poo to smell absolutely foul, just all in all makes for unpleasant odour experience.", "I went to school to me a butcher, we did a field trip to a hog farm. It took 3 days of showers to get the smell off. \n\nThe ride home from campus on the train during rush hour was hilarious, I've never had that much personal space on the train before. I was embarrassed at the time but laugh at it now."]}
