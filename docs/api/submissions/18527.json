She was excited to help me out, put me in touch with this farmyard animal rescue to intern at after graduation to build up a resume, and even offered to let me live with her for free and helped pay for my food/expenses after graduation till I got my first keeper job.\n\nWell, after a lot of hard work and interviewing and despairing I finally got an offer from a large accredited zoo - the zoo her friend works at. \n\nNow I'm 4 months into it and I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.\n\nThey have me working with penguins and seals. I was excited at first and wondered why more experienced keepers would leave those roles open for a newcomer. I soon found out why.

As you said, the field is competitive - they'd find those penguins an eager replacement.\n\nI'm a zookeeper and your issue is common though, I think. There tends to be a culture of \"never complain about the grossness\" at zoos but if you go on zookeeper FB groups or even subreddits, it's very common to see \"how do I keep everything I own from smelling?\" questions, with the answers tending to be laughter and \"you don't!\"\n\nI know it can be a tough adjustment but it might help to be able to talk to your friend openly about your concern and see what she thinks. It's not a silly issue, it's more common than you'd think.", "INFO: Didn't they make you aware of the stench or in any way test your ability to cope with foul smells before hiring you? \n\nThought that was pretty standard these days in this field. My friend was a keeper and he said it was the easiest way they weed out potential new hires in - as you mention - a crowded field, among many who look good on paper but can't handle the work.", "NTA\n\nIt's your life: you tried this and it's not for you. \n\nIf this person is your friend they would want you to be happy, and helped you so you would be happy. If you are not happy then they should want you to fix that. \n\nFurther: every day you are taking up the role blocks someone who does want to do it forever, so not quitting would be bad too.", "NAH but I think you might surprise yourself if you're willing to stick it out. All careers have hurdles but if you can look at this aspect of the job with a sense of humor and not as a \"life-ruining\" thing you might hopefully start to get your passion back.\n\nI will say as a former keeper that this isn't a \"they gave you the worst assignment and now you're doomed to stink forever\" situation. Many (most?) keepers deal with this to some degree or another.\n\nWho do you think has it better? Big cat keepers? That smell is utterly vile, as you mention. Small mammals? Be thankful penguins don't produce musk. That truly won't come off, as a fox-keeper friend of mine knows. Hoofstock? Man, elephant smells are strong too.\n\nThere are ways to cope and deal with it and it should continue becoming easier over time. You're probably not struggling now as much as month 1, before you were \"noseblind\" as you say, right? I might try to stick it out and see if it keeps getting more comfortable for you.", "NTA\n\nIt is important to actually enjoy the work you do. People just simply can\u2019t stay at a place where they have issues.\n\nFact is, before actually doing something, you can\u2019t properly know how you will react.\n\nLike I love anatomy, and find disease and stuff facinating. Then at uni we had a course where we got to see organs that had been newly removed from someone in the morgue, and I knew I could never pursuit a job in that field due to the smell. \n\nSo no matter how much help you got to get this job, you can\u2019t force yourself to stay, you will most likely just grow to recent it even more.", "NTA \n\nEvery job can create an Imposter Syndrome.

You are free to quit if its not for you but you should have considered it better before you got into it.", "As a long-time zookeeper I think I see what your issue is but you might not like it or be able or willing to fix it.\n\nYou're still seeing animal smells as a **problem** to be avoided. And not something to fully embrace as part of your love for animals.\n\nI know this sounds wild. Zookeepers tend to be a pretty crazy bunch. But the long-time ones I've been around all mostly see it this way, I think. If you see this aspect of your animals as something nasty and gross to talk about and to be avoided, you're in for a lifetime of frustration.\n\nReal conversation between two coworkers just a while back in the break room. One reeks of tomcat spray stronger than I think I've ever smelled in my life, lol:\n\n**A**: Oh, whew, B, did (lion) hose you down again?\n\n**B**: (Laughing, smiling) Yep, got me square in the chest. \n\n**A**: (laughing) Twice in one week, congratulations. Gonna take a shower break?\n\n**B**: Nah, I'll let it soak into the shirt, I'm honored (lion) wants me to smell like him.\n\n(both pull out sandwiches and start eating).\n\nYou've gotten past the step most people can't get to, where you can deal with the smells without feeling ill or something. But if you can move past the negative emotions associated with them totally then you'll be One Of Us! Just think, everyone smells like something. Most people have to smell like lame humans but you get to smell like a penguin! How cool is that? Right? right?", "Two things,\n1 - talk to your friend about how you\u2019re feeling, and maybe discuss the smell stuff with your colleagues, maybe they just need to push to let go about how they feel about the stink. Having people you can vent to at work is a key part of any workplace imo. \n\n2 - maybe see what the next role will be? Could you ask to move to a different animal, as a secondment perhaps, and see if you have the same reaction. You said you did the farm work so maybe land animals would be easier for you?\n\nEither way, NTA, but don\u2019t surprise your friend with this by suddenly announcing you\u2019re leaving, that would be the part that hurt.", "NTA, sometimes it just doesn't work out and if you want to save face with both your friend and the zoo is to be honest and say it's too much.  That's not a normal job, it definitely takes a certain type and I'm sure the people who have been doing that for awhile understand that.\n\nI worked an atypical job.  I built cellphone towers.  A person sees the pictures and amazing views and says I want to give that a shot.  Yeah heights become very real very fast when you start.  But I never thought down of people who couldn't do it and I'll give them respect for even trying.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you gave it a solid try, and things just aren't working out. A real friend wouldn't fault you for that.", "NTA. Sometimes you have to actually do something to realize that it is or isn\u2019t for you. Sounds like you did the prep and went in eyes wide open but the reality and impact on your life were just different than you expected. That\u2019s not your fault. Loose analogy I always thought I\u2019d be a good doctor or nurse. Zero issues with body functions and smells, I love seeing surgeries, tried to watch as much of my own c sections as I could, etc. Then last year my cat started needing daily analgesic injections. I was like yeah no problem. Turns out I can\u2019t do it. Lol my ex has to do it.", "YWBTA if you quit after only 4 months. Give it at least a full year to not look like a total AH, two full years to not look like an AH at all.", "INFO - did you do any type of job shadowing or work experience before you made the decision?\n\nBut in any case - you can't continue doing something you because your friend supported you. I'd suggest speaking to her and letting her know that you are really struggling with it before you bail but ultimately you need to do what's best for you and the penguins.\n\nNAH.", "No, it\u2019s your life, I\u2019d just be as thankful as possible to that person. And see this as a good thing you ended up not liking one job so now you can find something else.", "NAH you are unhappy and you do not have to stay where you are unhappy. But is your friend or another keeper available so you can be honest and talk to somebody in person? It might help to have a friend in person who understands the whole situation and can make you feel more supported. I think unless you are absolutely miserable maybe stick it out for a full 6 months and then after that if you are still unhappy, feel good that you gave it a try and it is not for you.", "Thanks. It feels good to know I'm not the only one struggling with this.\n\nIt feels hard to bring up because I would feel so stupid saying \"I sacrificed years of my life trying to become a zookeeper but then I quit because penguins are smelly.\" Who does that? I feel like I'm being stupid about all this.", "When I got my first zoo job 20 years ago there was even a question on the application about ranking your ability to deal with smells, 0 to 10. It had a note \"Be prepared to prove it at your interview if you select 10,\" or something like that.\n\nBeing the self-sure youngster I was, I put 10.\n\nPart of my interview was ten feet downwind of the dumpster they shovel the big cat waste into. Heaps and heaps of lion waste and old meat. I could barely hear myself think to answer the questions. I thought my **brain** was melting it was so bad.\n\nSomehow I didn't puke, and thus began my career working with big cats.", "Oh they did, at least to some degree. Maybe they figured the farm internship would help prepare me. But they asked me in the interview how I think I'd cope with the nastiness of the job, part of the interview was conducted in the just-before-cleaning-time sea lion enclosure when the stench was the strongest, and the practical part of the interview involved a senior keeper showing me the fecal lab and going through the fecal analysis process for a sample of seal feces, and then testing my knowledge of the process afterwards. Made me almost hurl but I got through it.\n\nI'm fine with that stuff, really, I have a strong stomach I think, or I'd never have gotten through the first month. Now I'm sort of nose-blind to it, at least in a sense. \n\nBut others aren't. I didn't expect it to be this pervasive as a permanent part of my life. People give me weird grossed out looks when I walk into a store. Some old friends don't seem to want to hang out anymore. Maybe it's just a bit of a shock to me and will take some getting used to...I dunno.", "Man, this is a sobering thread to read as someone studying to be a zookeeper. The smell gets brought up a lot but I sort of laugh it off. I mean I've been to the zoo and sure, it smells, but not in a...life-ruining sort of way. But behind the scenes...maybe it's way worse. **shudder**\n\nJust how bad does it get, I wonder? And why is OP finding it impossible to wash off even after work? I also am doing farm volunteering currently, mucking cow barns, and it stinks bad, but I got over it and now it doesn't bother me anymore! I thought that was a good sign for being a zookeeper...but yikes, people are acting like that barely even registers on the zookeeper smell-o-meter!", "I do think the op was completed deluded about being a zoo keeper though. Did she think, like a five-year-old would, that it was all cuddling fluffy baby animals? She sounds like someone who wants to be a nurse then is stunned that bodily fluids of patients are involved.", "> Small mammals? Be thankful penguins don't produce musk.\n\nIs the musk really a bigger deal than the poo, though? How so?", "That's not fair, she spent a lot of time interning and thought she would like it. She wouldnt have wasted all that time if she was on the fence about it, but things change. TONS of people change their minds about interests the longer they do it.", "You KNEW penguins were smelly. You KNEW zoos were smelly. Everyone knows these things.\n\nWhat you DIDNT know is how constantly smelling would affect your mental health. You DIDNT know how much youd grow to hate the stench, how no matter how much you shower, you STILL smell like animals. How going in public would feel, knowing you cant quit remove the smell. How waking up and putting on smelly clothes to get in your smelly car to drive to your smelly job would make you feel awful. You cant fault yourself for the things you didnt know! \n\nWe all live and learn, just have an honest talk with your friend and make sure you tell her you're grateful for all her help and this was an important step in your journey but that your mental wellbeing is being hurt by this occupation. A good friend will understand", "Nursing is another profession that requires years of specialized training and is unpleasant in ways that sound obvious going in. A third to half of new grad nurses leave the field within two years.  \n\nSo \"who does that?\" A lot of people, apparently!  \n\nI think you should do your best, give it a few more months, keep researching to see if there's any less smelly roles this experience qualifies you for -- I had friends who worked with lab reptiles who never smelled, maybe a job like that would be an option? But if it turns out there isn't anything, well, careers are full of strange twists and turns. When you have a bad day at a future job at least you can look back and go, \"well, at least I don't smell like otters.\"", "I mean pervasive scent is one of the reasons we could never farm pigs, not even as a secondary job. Some of those farms pay really well but it\u2019s not enough to make up for the smell. Same with industrial turkey or chicken farms. I don\u2019t even like having just a few pigs on our farm when we\u2019ve raised them for a CSA. You can hardly escape it. Free range/pasture and rotational movement helps. Is there a career path laid out for you at the zoo that would let you switch areas?\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unreasonable to switch careers. You can be grateful to your friend for the opportunity while also understanding that opportunity has taught you what you don\u2019t want out of life, and move on from there.", "You definitely need some sort of behind the scenes exposure to really grasp how bad the smell is - does your local zoo have volunteer opportunities? To be honest, farmyard animal smells are nothing compared to zoo/wild animal smells. Cows smell genuinely pleasant compared to something like piles of seal shit.", "Well, I had volunteered at a farm, doing dirty, smelly work, for almost a year before the zoo job. I wasn't under the impression it'd be petting fluffy animals.\n\nIt's just that at the farm, I could shower after work and then live my life. Here, it feels like that just...doesn't work. No amount of showering removes the smell.", "100% this", "Musk is a very strong smell and it lingers", "Could have just volunteered. Its like learning how to swim on the internet. Give it a try before you make serious decisions. Hope OP learnt from this experience.", "Oh, interesting. Thanks for the insight. Is there a reason that it smells so much worse behind the scenes? Just closer proximity? Same \"zoo\" smell but stronger or it's worse than just that?\n\n>Cows smell genuinely pleasant compared to something like piles of seal shit.\n\nFrom diet mostly? I would think seal poo might be a bit gnarlier but I thought the cows could make up for that with sheer volume! But perhaps it doesn't work that way. You've been around seals yourself?", "If you could move to herbivores, particularly the ungulates you might find the smell is better (I'm guessing that's why the farm was better). Carnivores are just smellier and like to scent things... And that stuff is designed to stick.", "Yeah but I feel like that\u2019s very commonly brought up as a con of that job. Like I know that, and I\u2019ve never worked in zookeeping nor do I know anyone who does. It just gives the impression that maybe you didn\u2019t research this career path all that thoroughly.", "Could you ask the zoo if you could rotate to another animal? Like every month or so, everyone could rotate, not only for the experience, but just to mix things up so every day isn't the EXACT same.", "Yeah but she needed a job. If she already had a stable job and thought hey maybe I want to be a zookeeper then yeah sure, volunteering wouldve been the way to go. But she needed a stable career, did the work to get said career, and has changed her mind, which is completely fine to do.", "Herbivore poop doesnt tend to smell that bad (at least in terms of what Ive smelled), but carnivore poop is absolutely vile. It doesnt just smell \"bad,\" but its eye-wateringly strong and incredibly overpowering. Thats why zookeepers talk about smelling bad all the time - it seeps into you. Big cats AFAIK are notorious for that. \n\nMy exposure to seals comes from wild seals rather than zoo animals, but yeah, it is AWFUL. On the island where I was working, if the wind was blowing the wrong way, all you could smell was seal shit. So vile from a distance, and somehow it managed to be even worse of you stumbled onto fresh shit. I think it was the second worst thing Id ever smelled in my life.", "Well people say farmwork is stinky too, so I don't think it was so out of left field for OP to extrapolate that to the zoo work. At least I wouldn't have expected it to be so bad that showering thoroughly and changing clothes after work doesn't work enough since I worked in smelly fields too and that has been sufficient with them. Sometimes you have to really do the stuff to really understand. \n\nAnd to OP: you're NTA if you change your field again. I think you're friend will understand if she is really a friend and wants you to be happy and content in life."]}
