As you said, the field is competitive - they'd find those penguins an eager replacement.\n\nI'm a zookeeper and your issue is common though, I think. There tends to be a culture of \"never complain about the grossness\" at zoos but if you go on zookeeper FB groups or even subreddits, it's very common to see \"how do I keep everything I own from smelling?\" questions, with the answers tending to be laughter and \"you don't!\"\n\nI know it can be a tough adjustment but it might help to be able to talk to your friend openly about your concern and see what she thinks.

Many (most?) keepers deal with this to some degree or another.\n\nWho do you think has it better? Big cat keepers? That smell is utterly vile, as you mention. Small mammals? Be thankful penguins don't produce musk. That truly won't come off, as a fox-keeper friend of mine knows. Hoofstock? Man, elephant smells are strong too.\n\nThere are ways to cope and deal with it and it should continue becoming easier over time.

And not something to fully embrace as part of your love for animals.\n\nI know this sounds wild. Zookeepers tend to be a pretty crazy bunch. But the long-time ones I've been around all mostly see it this way, I think. If you see this aspect of your animals as something nasty and gross to talk about and to be avoided, you're in for a lifetime of frustration.\n\nReal conversation between two coworkers just a while back in the break room. One reeks of tomcat spray stronger than I think I've ever smelled in my life, lol:\n\n**A**: Oh, whew, B, did (lion) hose you down again?\n\n**B**: (Laughing, smiling) Yep, got me square in the chest. \n\n**A**: (laughing) Twice in one week, congratulations.

But if you can move past the negative emotions associated with them totally then you'll be One Of Us! Just think, everyone smells like something. Most people have to smell like lame humans but you get to smell like a penguin! How cool is that? Right? right?", "Two things,\n1 - talk to your friend about how you\u2019re feeling, and maybe discuss the smell stuff with your colleagues, maybe they just need to push to let go about how they feel about the stink. Having people you can vent to at work is a key part of any workplace imo. \n\n2 - maybe see what the next role will be? Could you ask to move to a different animal, as a secondment perhaps, and see if you have the same reaction. You said you did the farm work so maybe land animals would be easier for you?\n\nEither way, NTA, but don\u2019t surprise your friend with this by suddenly announcing you\u2019re leaving, that would be the part that hurt.", "NTA, sometimes it just doesn't work out and if you want to save face with both your friend and the zoo is to be honest and say it's too much.  That's not a normal job, it definitely takes a certain type and I'm sure the people who have been doing that for awhile understand that.\n\nI worked an atypical job.  I built cellphone towers.  A person sees the pictures and amazing views and says I want to give that a shot.  Yeah heights become very real very fast when you start.  But I never thought down of people who couldn't do it and I'll give them respect for even trying.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you gave it a solid try, and things just aren't working out.

Sounds like you did the prep and went in eyes wide open but the reality and impact on your life were just different than you expected. That\u2019s not your fault. Loose analogy I always thought I\u2019d be a good doctor or nurse. Zero issues with body functions and smells, I love seeing surgeries, tried to watch as much of my own c sections as I could, etc. Then last year my cat started needing daily analgesic injections. I was like yeah no problem. Turns out I can\u2019t do it. Lol my ex has to do it.", "YWBTA if you quit after only 4 months.

And see this as a good thing you ended up not liking one job so now you can find something else.", "NAH you are unhappy and you do not have to stay where you are unhappy. But is your friend or another keeper available so you can be honest and talk to somebody in person? It might help to have a friend in person who understands the whole situation and can make you feel more supported. I think unless you are absolutely miserable maybe stick it out for a full 6 months and then after that if you are still unhappy, feel good that you gave it a try and it is not for you.", "Thanks. It feels good to know I'm not the only one struggling with this.\n\nIt feels hard to bring up because I would feel so stupid saying \"I sacrificed years of my life trying to become a zookeeper but then I quit because penguins are smelly.\" Who does that? I feel like I'm being stupid about all this.", "When I got my first zoo job 20 years ago there was even a question on the application about ranking your ability to deal with smells, 0 to 10. It had a note \"Be prepared to prove it at your interview if you select 10,\" or something like that.\n\nBeing the self-sure youngster I was, I put 10.\n\nPart of my interview was ten feet downwind of the dumpster they shovel the big cat waste into. Heaps and heaps of lion waste and old meat. I could barely hear myself think to answer the questions. I thought my **brain** was melting it was so bad.\n\nSomehow I didn't puke, and thus began my career working with big cats.", "Oh they did, at least to some degree. Maybe they figured the farm internship would help prepare me. But they asked me in the interview how I think I'd cope with the nastiness of the job, part of the interview was conducted in the just-before-cleaning-time sea lion enclosure when the stench was the strongest, and the practical part of the interview involved a senior keeper showing me the fecal lab and going through the fecal analysis process for a sample of seal feces, and then testing my knowledge of the process afterwards. Made me almost hurl but I got through it.\n\nI'm fine with that stuff, really, I have a strong stomach I think, or I'd never have gotten through the first month. Now I'm sort of nose-blind to it, at least in a sense. \n\nBut others aren't. I didn't expect it to be this pervasive as a permanent part of my life. People give me weird grossed out looks when I walk into a store. Some old friends don't seem to want to hang out anymore. Maybe it's just a bit of a shock to me and will take some getting used to...I dunno.", "Man, this is a sobering thread to read as someone studying to be a zookeeper. The smell gets brought up a lot but I sort of laugh it off. I mean I've been to the zoo and sure, it smells, but not in a...life-ruining sort of way. But behind the scenes...maybe it's way worse. **shudder**\n\nJust how bad does it get, I wonder? And why is OP finding it impossible to wash off even after work? I also am doing farm volunteering currently, mucking cow barns, and it stinks bad, but I got over it and now it doesn't bother me anymore! I thought that was a good sign for being a zookeeper...but yikes, people are acting like that barely even registers on the zookeeper smell-o-meter!", "I do think the op was completed deluded about being a zoo keeper though. Did she think, like a five-year-old would, that it was all cuddling fluffy baby animals? She sounds like someone who wants to be a nurse then is stunned that bodily fluids of patients are involved.", "> Small mammals? Be thankful penguins don't produce musk.\n\nIs the musk really a bigger deal than the poo, though? How so?", "That's not fair, she spent a lot of time interning and thought she would like it. She wouldnt have wasted all that time if she was on the fence about it, but things change. TONS of people change their minds about interests the longer they do it.", "You KNEW penguins were smelly. You KNEW zoos were smelly. Everyone knows these things.\n\nWhat you DIDNT know is how constantly smelling would affect your mental health. You DIDNT know how much youd grow to hate the stench, how no matter how much you shower, you STILL smell like animals. How going in public would feel, knowing you cant quit remove the smell. How waking up and putting on smelly clothes to get in your smelly car to drive to your smelly job would make you feel awful. You cant fault yourself for the things you didnt know! \n\nWe all live and learn, just have an honest talk with your friend and make sure you tell her you're grateful for all her help and this was an important step in your journey but that your mental wellbeing is being hurt by this occupation. A good friend will understand", "Nursing is another profession that requires years of specialized training and is unpleasant in ways that sound obvious going in. A third to half of new grad nurses leave the field within two years.  \n\nSo \"who does that?\" A lot of people, apparently!  \n\nI think you should do your best, give it a few more months, keep researching to see if there's any less smelly roles this experience qualifies you for -- I had friends who worked with lab reptiles who never smelled, maybe a job like that would be an option? But if it turns out there isn't anything, well, careers are full of strange twists and turns. When you have a bad day at a future job at least you can look back and go, \"well, at least I don't smell like otters.\"", "I mean pervasive scent is one of the reasons we could never farm pigs, not even as a secondary job. Some of those farms pay really well but it\u2019s not enough to make up for the smell. Same with industrial turkey or chicken farms. I don\u2019t even like having just a few pigs on our farm when we\u2019ve raised them for a CSA. You can hardly escape it. Free range/pasture and rotational movement helps. Is there a career path laid out for you at the zoo that would let you switch areas?\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not unreasonable to switch careers. You can be grateful to your friend for the opportunity while also understanding that opportunity has taught you what you don\u2019t want out of life, and move on from there.", "You definitely need some sort of behind the scenes exposure to really grasp how bad the smell is - does your local zoo have volunteer opportunities? To be honest, farmyard animal smells are nothing compared to zoo/wild animal smells. Cows smell genuinely pleasant compared to something like piles of seal shit.", "Well, I had volunteered at a farm, doing dirty, smelly work, for almost a year before the zoo job. I wasn't under the impression it'd be petting fluffy animals.\n\nIt's just that at the farm, I could shower after work and then live my life. Here, it feels like that just...doesn't work. No amount of showering removes the smell.", "100% this", "Musk is a very strong smell and it lingers", "Could have just volunteered. Its like learning how to swim on the internet. Give it a try before you make serious decisions. Hope OP learnt from this experience.", "Oh, interesting. Thanks for the insight. Is there a reason that it smells so much worse behind the scenes? Just closer proximity? Same \"zoo\" smell but stronger or it's worse than just that?\n\n>Cows smell genuinely pleasant compared to something like piles of seal shit.\n\nFrom diet mostly? I would think seal poo might be a bit gnarlier but I thought the cows could make up for that with sheer volume! But perhaps it doesn't work that way. You've been around seals yourself?", "If you could move to herbivores, particularly the ungulates you might find the smell is better (I'm guessing that's why the farm was better). Carnivores are just smellier and like to scent things... And that stuff is designed to stick.", "Yeah but I feel like that\u2019s very commonly brought up as a con of that job. Like I know that, and I\u2019ve never worked in zookeeping nor do I know anyone who does. It just gives the impression that maybe you didn\u2019t research this career path all that thoroughly.", "Could you ask the zoo if you could rotate to another animal? Like every month or so, everyone could rotate, not only for the experience, but just to mix things up so every day isn't the EXACT same.", "Yeah but she needed a job. If she already had a stable job and thought hey maybe I want to be a zookeeper then yeah sure, volunteering wouldve been the way to go. But she needed a stable career, did the work to get said career, and has changed her mind, which is completely fine to do.", "Herbivore poop doesnt tend to smell that bad (at least in terms of what Ive smelled), but carnivore poop is absolutely vile. It doesnt just smell \"bad,\" but its eye-wateringly strong and incredibly overpowering. Thats why zookeepers talk about smelling bad all the time - it seeps into you. Big cats AFAIK are notorious for that. \n\nMy exposure to seals comes from wild seals rather than zoo animals, but yeah, it is AWFUL. On the island where I was working, if the wind was blowing the wrong way, all you could smell was seal shit. So vile from a distance, and somehow it managed to be even worse of you stumbled onto fresh shit. I think it was the second worst thing Id ever smelled in my life.", "Well people say farmwork is stinky too, so I don't think it was so out of left field for OP to extrapolate that to the zoo work. At least I wouldn't have expected it to be so bad that showering thoroughly and changing clothes after work doesn't work enough since I worked in smelly fields too and that has been sufficient with them. Sometimes you have to really do the stuff to really understand. \n\nAnd to OP: you're NTA if you change your field again. I think you're friend will understand if she is really a friend and wants you to be happy and content in life.", "The smell is in your nose most likely, not actually on you. You literally need to wash the inside of your nostrils with soap or shampoo because the fats get stuck in your nose hairs. Then saline rinse your sinuses. Use enzyme based detergent to immediately soak your clothes. Then coat the inside of your nose with a thin layer of Vicks vapor rub. Put an open container of coffee grounds in your car to absorb odors.\n\nYou're likely also using the wrong products to break down the smells. Unscented or citrus scented products work best IMO. Scented laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets trap stinky smells in. You want to use an unscented enzyme based laundry detergent and a cup of white vinegar as a fabric softener, no GD dryer sheets. \n\nAlso, ask about trying a new animal group. Maybe the herbivores would work for you or the reptile house.", "YWNBTA - but if you do back out its an irrevocable step so maybe see if you can tolerate it a but more. Take more steps to keep job smells and normal people apart - always shower and change clothes completely at end of shift  - never get in your car in work clothes - spend more time with other people who have smelly jobs. Also talk to your friend.   \nit is a problematic job and probably takes about a year to get fully integrated - which for most people will happen (humans are very adaptable) and you actually only done a few months - but it\u2019s your mental health and if you show no sign of adapting completely then you need to do what is best for you.", "INFO\n\nDo you plan on paying that person back?  \n\nThey would be totally in the right to be upset if you used their money then dipped out.", "At the end of the day, there are other career options outside of zoos.

I worked mostly hoofstock, but moved into carnivore/primate later in my career. 100% NTA. I saw so many interns and newer keepers wash out early on for many of the reasons that you mentioned. It takes a special kind of crazy to have a camel regurgitate on you and still show up for work the next day to care for said camel. This career is more of a lifestyle, and it\u2019s not your fault that the field is so competitive that you \u201cplayed the game\u201d (used some connections) to get where you are. Have you considered trying the education or outreach department? You still do keeper stuff but it\u2019s generally lighter and you bring ambassador animals to schools and other events. Just a thought!", "NTA. You\u2019re you g and trying things out. But dont have 2nd thoughts- small community and word gets around. \nAnimals smell and it is not I common for ppl to get into animal-based careers and leave when they realise what it takes to keep these industries going\u2014 a lot of cleaning.", "NTA, and if you explain it to your friend I\u2019m sure she will understand!", "NTA. but I find it strange that there isn\u2019t some kind of rotation system at the zoo.

It's always harder to find a job when you are desperate. \n\nNTA", "NTA.   \n\n\nLook, what you want to do with your life is ultimately up to you. You can thank your friend for the wonderful opportunity, and be grateful, but you're not required to be in a position where you don't want to be, just because someone spent their time helping you get there. They weren't required to do so, just like you're not required to stay there.", "NTA, but you owe your friend an honest conversation about this before you just up and quit.\n\nLet me introduce you to a product that may change your life: [Biozet](https://www.biozetattack.com.au/product-information/), an Australian laundry detergent. You haven't said where in the world you are, but it should be possible for you to import some, and I've linked to a list of the active ingredients of it in case you want to compare for local equivalents.\n\nIts design specification is to eliminate odour-causing bacteria from cloth. It works in cold or hot water, though better in hot water. I was introduced to this stuff to remove cat pee smell from carpet in order to prevent the cat from peeing there again. Sprinkle some of the powder where the cat peed, wet it a bit, leave it for a while to dry, then clean it up. The cat themselves will not notice where they peed, and hopefully will not repeat the behaviour as cats so often do.\n\nI have since used it for towels left wet long enough to become mildew-smelling, and to remove dog poo, human vomit, human urine, possum spray, and a few other notably awful organic smells from surfaces and from clothing. It might solve your problem with the smells on your clothing, and potentially on your skin too if you use a bit of the powder to wash with.", "Before quitting. Her me out:\n\nYou seem to feel alone in your process.\n\nHave you tried to talk with the other zookeepers about it?

It's been 4 months dude, suffer through it, see if you can transfer to a different animal in the next 8 months and reevaluate at the 1.5 year mark, you can make it 1.5 years total at a job smelling bad to know for SURE you don't want it. I doubt you'll get hired for another zookeeper job if you dip at 4 months, so at least take the time to be actually sure.\n\nTo answer the question, YTA if you quit at 4 months, both to yourself, and anyone who stuck their neck out for you, at minimum give it a full year in the role, ideally 1.5. You got another 40 years of working ahead of you, you can afford another 8 months at this one.\n\n\nThe people saying NTA, and essentially saying to quit a career you've spent literal years planning for because \"You should love your job\" are delusional to think you should give up at 4 months, you've invested literal years and money/effort into getting this job, and you likely have nothing else lined up if you ditch it this quickly, to think this sort of decision should be a \"yeah if you hate it, leave at 4 months, you can go work at walmart\" sort of decision is actually insane. Every job has significant hurdles when you first start the career, sure it may not be smells that permeate your entire being, but the first 6-12 months of a new career are generally stressful and sometimes you wonder if you should find something else, then you find your footing and it gets better.

It's rare that they hate their whole profession and leave law entirely. Almost always they just need to find a firm and/or specialty that fits.

I ended up being put on temporary stress leave due to the mental strain of working with the animals, which eventually led to me leaving the job completely. \n\nI also worked as a vet technician and spent a lot of money going to school for it after I got burned out working with exotic animals. During my first veterinary internship I realized I absolutely was not cut out for it, simply on a physical level. The emotional toll was exhausting, and the lack of gratitude or recognition was astounding. After a lot of thought and debate, I decided to switch gears and start my own art business. I still wanted to find a way to help animals, but didn\u2019t want to sacrifice my mental or physical health. \n\nI now make anatomically accurate, fully artificial taxidermy (see post history) that is used to train wildlife handlers, exotic medical specialists, and educate the public. I specifically focus in bats (both mega and micro bat types). I use my business platform and my art to spread awareness about the bat poaching industry, wildlife trafficking, zoonotic diseases, and the illegal pet trade. I do not work with living animals on a daily basis anymore, but I can rest well knowing that my work is making a difference in the community and most importantly for the animals. I also regularly donate to and work independently alongside rehabilitation centers. \n\nI can tell that you *really* love these animals, just by how you talk in your post. You sound just like me. My recommendation to you is to use your education, knowledge, and your experience from working with these animals to help educate people about them. Perhaps instead of being a zoo keeper, consider looking into working at a wildlife rehabilitation center, or a privately owned wildlife reserve. I have volunteered/worked with a few and they are far more organized and genuinely care about the animals. \n\nI beat myself up for a long time about changing my job path because I felt like I gave up on the animals I love so much. I know now that is not the case, it\u2019s just my own anxiety. If your mental health is declining, you can\u2019t care for these animals properly. You have to put you first, even if it means making the hard choice to step away for a while. If your friend is a good one, she will understand why you\u2019re struggling. If she doesn\u2019t, that shows where you stand on her priority list. \n\nI hope you find a solution that will be more fitting for you. I send you all my best, and I hope this message helps you.", "I worked for a zoo for a few years some years ago. None of what you have said is even remotely surprising. The penguins and Seals are honestly pretty midrange work, it can get MUCH smellier than that, as you know with the experience of the big cat keepers.\n\n The zoo I worked for had progressive steps worked out with the local college to allow people many, many outs as a keeper before getting to the stage you are at now. \n\nI have said something like this a long time ago, and many people didn\u2019t believe me; but dating prospects for the large animals\u2019 keepers could be pretty slim because the smell invaded every part of their lives and they could pretty much only date other keepers or people who had zero sense of smell.\n\nYou now know that this is not the calling for you.

Some animals also have some kind of musk in their urine for scent marking which would also add to the smell. \n\nPenguin colonies also have a huge number of birds congregating and relieving themselves in the same area, which contributes to a stronger smell.", "Look up **Anti-Icky-Poo**, which is an enzymatic spray specifically designed for cleaning up after pets, and hasn't ruined any carpet or upholstery I've used it on (so far).", "GAH god damn it, thank you for your insight lol.

As would your supervisor or coworkers telling you about times when the animals where utter assholes they wanted to bbq, so the pressure to be saintly is lessened. \n\nIf that still doesn't work, be very honest and vulnerable with your friend about how you are sorry and feel like you are letting her down, but it's just impossible to continue this path.

Of course sometimes we did hear about stuff, like when someone fainted, needed medical attention\u2026 or the volunteer was particularly despised. \n\nEveryone has different tolerances for different smells. The big cats were not so bad for me, the gorillas were bad but not impossible to work around and the penguins were up there; but the worst by far were the Rhinos and Maned wolves. The maned wolves HAD to be cleaned down on a schedule or the guests would begin having issues being near their area. \n\nThe Rhinos were not bad from a distance, but the males can spray, and one area of our grounds in particular was designed where not only was it where the people could get closer to the animals than the rest of the area, but the building itself funneled the wind from the rhinos to the guests. Bad enough when it was just the wind, but our male tended to hang out in that area and at times sprayed our thankfully few annoying guests.

I think you have to work the way up the ladder before you get the plumb assignments like overseeing births/hatchings, acclimating animals to being handled by humans and interacting with the top tier animals.\n\nI also get the impression from the various Animal Planet zoo shows that there's significant OT.
