We decided host a decently large group for a grilled cheese night. After the dinner, I venmo requested everyone for the ingredients (which was only about $5/person). Everyone paid except for two of my friends, Jacob (28m) and his girlfriend Molly (24f). My phone pings with a paragraph of text from Jacob telling me that it's rude for me to request money from them when I offer to host a dinner party, especially when the cost is so low. I told him that - even though the cost per person was low - it ended up costing my boyfriend and I around $70 due to the amount of people . . . especially because Jacob and Molly specifically requested a bunch of extra toppings in addition to cheese like meat, eggs, avocados. He said my new job pays well so I should just cover the cost; the funny thing is that Jacob has worked a six figure job for the past five years and is a trust fund baby who recieves thousands of dollars in allowance each month . . . yet I never expect him to pay for things. I agreed that I'll cover the dinner as long as him and Molly host sometimes as well so that my boyfriend and I aren't constantly out money while they eat for free every week.\n\nFast forward to the next week, Jacob and Molly want to make a dinner that'll be a bit on the pricier side so they ask to split the cost \"just this once and next time they'd cover\" which was fine with us. Ran around $20 a person. My boyfriend and I pick up all the groceries for them plus a bottle of wine as a thank you for hosting (that we didn't charge them for) because they're busy cleaning the house. They continue to venmo request us for any meal they host after that (which is rare) even if it's just chicken breast and rice.\n\nFast forward a month later. Molly and Jacob still haven't paid for any dinners at promised. My friends and I decide to make a big birthday dinner for my boyfriend. We ALWAYS split birthday dinner costs, and have for the past 7 years of friendship. Another friend and I cook up this big dinner of crab legs, scallops, mashed potatoes, cake, etc. They come over, eat huge portions, and love the meal. Afterwards, I tell them that it'll be around $20 a person. Everyone pays . . . except Molly and Jacob again. After the party, I receive another wall of text message from Jacob telling me that he's \"already talked to me about how rude it is to charge people\" and that it was unfair that I put him on the spot to pay in front of everyone else because if he said no, he'd look like a jerk. I repeated to him that we host/pay pretty often and they have yet to hold up their end up the bargain. Now him and Molly are calling me immature and refusing to pay.\n\nAITA for asking them to pay for dinner?\n\nEDIT: To clarify since I've gotten a few comments taking issue with the fact that I asked for payment AFTERWARDS. My friends and I do dinners weekly and have been for the past few years. It's always been expected that we split the cost; we have dinner, then divvy up the reciept afterwards and venmo request. Jacob JUST began taking issue with this even though it's been this way for awhile, which is why it caught me offguard.

It\u2019s insane to chastise you for your \u201cfaux pa\u201d when they\u2019re taking advantage and not walking the walk. However, there\u2019s a big difference in my mind between asking for $ contribution to a party/meal ahead of time and instead asking for it afterwards\u2014especially when you admit that you don\u2019t always ask for money. People hate to be surprised or feel \u201cambushed\u201d. \n\n100%. First of all, I would never invite people to my home for dinner with the expectation that they subsidize the cost. That\u2019s just me, though.\n\nOn the flip side, when we get an invite, we ask what we can make/bring. If they insist we bring nothing at all, we still show up with either wine, beer, dessert, whatever we think they\u2019ll appreciate.\n\nFinally, with regard to this specific example you provided, here\u2019s why you\u2019re indeed the asshole:\n\nIf you intended for people to contribute to the cost of the food/ingredients, I guess that\u2019s reasonable, but you should\u2019ve ABSOLUTELY let people know upfront, at the time of the invitation!!!!\n\nHosting people, entertaining them at your home, sending them on their way, and THEN hitting them with a Venmo request??????? That\u2019s straight up insane to me.\n\nI would\u2019ve been one of the people to just send the money to you, but I guarantee that at least a good portion of the people that just paid up without comment\u2014that you seem to interpret as them being totally fine with it\u2014 we\u2019re blown away by the Venmo request. I\u2019d be shocked if there aren\u2019t some people joking/gossiping about it. Hell, the two that refused to pay and chewed you out might have even been involved in the gossip but actually had the courage/integrity to confront you about it directly.\n\nThis is just really, really poor form, OP, and I suggest you read the comments here and reflect on it.\n\nIn the big picture, it\u2019s just a couple of bucks, so it\u2019s not the end of the world, but stuff like this really sticks with people. \n\nIf you love to host and entertain, here\u2019s my suggestion:\n\n1. Host people that also love to cook and host. Then, you don\u2019t have to charge them for ingredients, and instead there\u2019s an unspoken quid pro quo when you visit their home for dinner.\n\n2. If you love hosting large groups for meals/dinner parties AND you\u2019re sort of the only/primary couple that hosts and cooks for people, let people know up front that you\u2019re expecting folks to pitch in on the cost. \n\nThen, at least you can present it like, \u201chey guys\u2026.we love to host and cook for the gang, and we don\u2019t love having to ask for people to pitch in, but we just can\u2019t really afford the cost on our own. We hope you guys enjoy it as much as we do, and we would love to keep it up if you guys are ok with splitting the cost\u201d.\n\nAnd if you go that route, be consistent in asking for the $ contribution to so it\u2019s just a part of the deal, and no one feels like it was unfair.\n\nYou could always once or twice a year, as a gift or whatever, tell the group that dinner is on you guys tonight, and let it be your Xmas gift to them or whatever makes sense.\n\n3. Continue to host dinners and parties, but limit the menu/budget to a $ cost, and frequency, that you CAN afford without asking for the others to contribute.\n\n4. Host pot lucks or even fun dinners where a few different attendees (number depends on kitchen size and whatnot) show up with ingredients to make a dish, and you guys cook a meal together (chaotic and messy, but fun).\n\n5. Finally, if you decide this is really important to you, and don\u2019t want to compromise on ingredients and expense because you\u2019re so passionate about food or whatever, budget for these dinners and parties. Everyone has a \u201centertainment budget\u201d whether they know it or actively track it or not.

If you rarely charge people, it hasn't been the expectation that people pay you back. You can't have it both ways. Also, if this story is true, you need to have a conversation with the full friend group to find out if something about the arrangement needs to change, if the entire group is supposedly talking behind your back and saying it's rude for you to expect the cost to be split, those aren't your friends.

Invite and include them when hosting, knowing they will participate, but not fund the meals and do so graciously, generously, AND NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.\n\n*OR*\n\n2.

Accept Jacob and Molly's invitations happily and accept all guests will be expected provide a share of the cost so Jacob and Molly can recoup the cost of the meal provided for you and other guests. (Without snark, without delay, and WITHOUT commenting on their behavior!)\n\n2. Decline Jacob and Molly's future invites (without rehashing the payment issue) and simply reply that you're unable to attend and leave it alone.

Can you continue to enjoy the meals shared with friends even though it won't be fair?  Maybe what you get from this community in support and joy outweighs the monetary imbalance. If so, continue to accept and extend invitations and view the additional costs as an insignificant fee you'll gladly incur in silence, for the benefit of everyone involved. \n\n\nMaybe you're happy to pay when you're a guest, but can't accept they will stiff you when you host. That's ok! Or maybe you don't mind paying for their participation in dinner, BUT cannot stomach paying them for the meals they provide. That would be reasonable also. But either way, stay classy and keep your reasons to yourself. \n\nBut if this inequity is an affront to your core values- (one that you cannot accept) then you have to SILENTLY exclude them as guests and POLITELY decline all future invitations from them.

NTA.", "Yeah, this is where I land to a \u2018T\u2019.\n\nI had no idea people asked for money when hosting dinners.\n\nI guess when I was 20ish or something we\u2019d all kick in for like stuff to grill and beer, rather than the \u201chost\u201d be on the hook for all of it.\n\nAnd, I also can understand a group of young adult friends/couples who are all struggling to get by having an expressed agreement that whoever hosts the group for dinner will be paid by the others to cover the cost of the meal\u2014the caveat there being that it would be consistent/standard and thus expected by everyone, AND that the guests should know what the cost will be (I mean at the very least a reasonable estimate would suffice) before the dinner. \n\nThen, anyone that for whatever reason couldn\u2019t afford it/isn\u2019t a fan of the food can decline the invite.", "I asked them to pay afterward because, in the past, we always had this set rule that we would split and just charge everyone after we look over the reciept and divvyed it up. Jacob JUST started taking issue with this even tho he asks for the payment after the dinners he hosts as well. Not that that negates your point, just clarifying why I asked for it after the fact  \n\n\nEdit: Our friends have dinner get togethers weekly, so they're not special events", "...Did you even actually read the entire post?", "That's definitely true, I think restaurants are a good solution. These two friends always ask if we can cook at home because it's cheaper . . . for them. But I think it is time to draw that boundary. Thanks!", "Next time, I'll just skip dinner and opt for the dessert of sweet, sweet justice.", "See my edit", "I'm realizing my post is really unclear, so here's the \"timeline\". 1. It's standard in our friend group to split dinner costs (and venmo request everyone AFTER). 2. Jacob suddenly takes issue with us venmo requesting, even tho I was under the impression that it was still the routine. 3. We agree that the fair thing is that whoever hosts covers the full cost, he says that him and Molly will host more often. 4. My boyfriend and I continue to host and pay. 5. Molly and Jacob host a \"big dinner\" once and split the cost amongst us. And a couple smaller, simpler ones where they also venmo request us after the fact. 6. I venmo request them for the birthday dinner because that was the set expectation, especially since we had just paid for their birthdays earlier. \n\nI'll admit, they kinda played me. And our other friends too who keep hosting. But hopefully that clears it up?", "I'd say that's true in general, but among friends who do this frequently and take turns hosting, I think splitting the costs could work, but the system OP is using isn't working, since some people don't want to pay. I also think it would be better to set a budget beforehand for the meal and let people know in advance what their share of the cost would be.", "Thanks for the link! Love her explanations", "Haha I love \"revengeance birthday arc\". Yes, I do think a good solution would be to calculate some sort of rough cost up front.", "I only mentioned his finances because he made my finances an issue. See my edit . . . it's been an expectation for years that we split and divvy up the costs AFTER dinner. But you do have a good point that - even if that expectation has been set for awhile - they can use the \"afterwards\" defense in their favor.", "I mean.... grilled cheese!?? Doesn't get cheaper than that. Are you having the same bunch over for ramen next time?", "If you read my edit, I mentioned that we always go in the the expectation of splitting costs and that's been the tradition so it isn't sudden. What was sudden was Jacob's aversion to payment, honestly left not only me but our other friends really confused.", "Touche lol", "Ah I suck at clarity with reddit posts. There are 8 of us. Each pair takes turns hosting with the expecation that we split, especially cuz sometimes people will host twice in a row or multiple times a week. Jacob and Molly only host like 10% of the time and we all paid, cuz that was the expectation at the time. My boyfriend and I sometimes tell people not to worry about it at the end of the dinner (even though they had expected to venmo us afterwards). So what I meant by that is . . . the expectation is to pay, but sometimes we surprise them with a \"don't worry about it, it's on us\" afterwards. The entire friend group is a little upset about the lack of hosting and sudden refusal to pay on Jacob and Molly's part so it's not just my boyfriend and I.

It\u2019s not exactly apples to apples, but I think there\u2019s some good takes in there.\n\nIf you are sincere in trying to get people\u2019s perspective because you are also willing to do differently in the future to try and better navigate/avoid this conflict, and are not just trying to have your opinion validated to be \u201cright\u201d, there\u2019s some good suggestions to be found.", "What I don\u2019t understand is this:\n\n1. You already have the receipt and have bought the ingredients before the dinner. At the minimum, a few hours ahead, and probably sometimes a couple days ahead. So, I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t have a reasonable idea of the cost per person until after the dinner? \n\nI get different groups have their own traditions and sort of ways of doing things. But, because you said that you often don\u2019t charge anybody anything at all for dinners,I can definitely see why someone would balk at a surprise Venmo request, especially for a grilled cheese dinner (I get it\u2026.fancy cheese, fancy bread, toppings, it\u2019s more costly than it \u201csounds\u201d like) that is miles away from what most people think of as a costly meal.\n\nI just really can\u2019t think of a good reason why you have to request money after the fact. And as an aside, at the risk of sounding old as fuck, sending a Venmo request seems like a really bad way to do that if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. An email or a text would come off way better imo. At least then you can be like, \u201cok gang! You know the drill! Last night\u2019s bill came out to $74.99. So by my Einstein level maths that\u2019s xx.xx a person\u201d.\n\n2. Why do you guys charge each other? I really don\u2019t get it. Charging up front would make sense to me if only 1-2 people did the majority of cooking and hosting because they\u2019d be shouldering all of the expense and effort. Or, if once in a blue moon, someone wanted to really throw down and make some outrageous meal consisting of much more expensive than average ingredients.\n\nBut, in a group of people that are having weekly dinners and taking turns, why don\u2019t you all just foot the bill when it\u2019s your night, and not bother with paying?\n\nIf someone is seemingly taking advantage, either not hosting, or cooking really cheap stuff comparatively, yeah, that\u2019s an issue to address. Or, if there\u2019s someone or a few peeps that don\u2019t have the space/home/cooking acumen to host, I could see them wanting to (or being asked) to contribute to the group by \u201cpaying their way\u201d or being like the wine/beer person.", "One more thing:\n\nI thought you said previously that Jacob had asked for money up front from everyone when he hosted? I\u2019m confused I guess.\n\nIf he literally host people for dinner, then afterwards \u201cbills\u201d everyone, I\u2019m totally lost LOL. \n\nHow could he possibly object to you doing the EXACT same thing?", "It may be normal for you, but it isn't normal. No way I would ever expect people to pay me if I was hosting a dinner, thats honestly wild. Hes an ass for his response, but you're an ass for even thinking you can ask people this.", "How much time between the agreement in 3 and you venmo request in 6?\n\n> And a couple smaller, simpler ones where they also venmo request us after the fact.\n\nDid you object to this? If so, what did they say?", "Oh I actually love that idea of setting a budget!", "See my edit. Paying each other for every meal has been the standard for years since we all host dinners so often, no matter how cheap. Ramen does sound good tho lol.", "I sincerely hope you're not this gullible in other parts of your life. Like this was embarrassingly naive... And I'm on the spectrum... even I saw it :/\n\nAlso your friend changed because of his new girl toy lmao. Ps they're broke and likely massively in debt. People with money don't do what they do. People who want people to think they have money, do.", "No, this isn't us. But that's crazy that there was an issue so similar on here haha", "In our group of friends, it's always me and one of my other friends hosting or cooking. Generally we grab the groceries (which sometimes involves grabbing things just for ourselves), get straight to cooking, and then divvy up the receipt afterwards just due to time (and because not everything on the receipt should be charge to the group). \n\nI only stopped charging AFTER my friend had brought up the fact that it bothered him, but that was  under the impression that we'd kind of do the back and forth thing of taking turns hosting/paying (my friend group rotates who hosts, but Jacob and Molly raaaarely host and always ask us all to split the cost when it's their turn). I only charged for the birthday because that's also been an expecation since we've known each other. \n\nThanks for the insight on both your comments! Sucks to hear I'm the AH in this situation, but it is helpful to see other people's opinions/possible solutions since I'm obviously biased.", "Ohp, sorry didn't see your second comment when I replied. When we split the dinner I specifically mentioned in the post, he talked about splitting up front which was totally fine with us. But since then, if he hosts dinner, he asks us to venmo him AFTER. Even if it's something cheap.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f sums it all up.  I would never expect people to pay me if I\u2019m hosting. That\u2019s just asking for pissed off guests. That said, people always ask what they can bring\u2026 so, just ask each couple to contribute a dish or two, or if they want something special or specific (ie., Jacob\u2019s extra toppings) just ask them to supply the ingredients. Rotate hosting (and who is responsible for the main course) so next time, you just contribute a side dish or two. It will all come out in the wash.", "That way if someone wants to do something really pricey, people can opt in (or out) depending on what they're comfortable paying. And if they don't Venmo before the host goes shopping, they're not part of that week's dinner.", "Sorry, your edit completely changes the question. Poorly presented. We respond to the FIRST version you give us. \n\nYTA.", "I vote NTA. \n\nProbably adjust the group\u2019s expectations in advance. Make it standard practice that everyone pays for their share of the ingredients. \nThe whole \u201cnobody pays for anything because it all balances out\u201d model never truly work\u2019s perfectly and outright fails if someone deliberately takes advantage of it. \n\nIf Jacob and Molly have an issue with that, then they always have the option not to come. If they show up and make a fuss afterwards, then it\u2019s easy to point out that the cost was clearly communicated in advance and they agreed to it implicitly by showing up. \nMaybe let them get away with an excuse once, but point out that this will be standard practice going forward. I can\u2019t think of a single excuse that has merit after that. \nIf they do it again, then they clearly aren\u2019t following the rules and are no longer invited to the dinners that you host. \n\nAdditionally, you\u2019re only asking to be reimbursed for the ingredients. That\u2019s generous considering you are also hosting and preparing the food.", "I was leaning toward YTA just based on charging your guests when hosting, but it seems this is equitable and accepted within your friend group, so NTA after all. Not really that different from gathering at a restaurant and having separate tickets or splitting equally - as long as that is understood by invitees in advance. \nJacob and Molly are trying to take advantage of ALL of you by stiffing everyone and then making sure to collect when they do play 'host'. They should be dropped from the guest/host list entirely as they seem to want to play by different rules than anyone else. That's going to be a drain on the party energy if allowed to continue.", "My question is do Jacob and Molly pay when your other friends host?", "Sometimes. It depends on what they deem is worth the cost."]}
