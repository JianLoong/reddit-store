As I'm the older one among my brothers and cousins (my first cousin was born when I was 7, and my first brother when I was 8), since I was 10 I was always their nanny and basically helped a lot to raise all of them (2 brothers, 7 cousins), to the point my parents bragged about how I was an expert changing diapers, feeding and taking care of them at 13 (I still dont know if that was something worth to be proud about). \n\nMy problem is that a nurse from that hospital recognized my last name, she went to tell everything to my aunt, and she told it to my mom. So, the day I went back home, she came and we had a figth about it. \n\nShe acussed me of being awfull and selfish, saying things that I had no rigth to take that desition and that I took away her dream of being a grandmother, that I was insane and I will regret doing this. I tried to explain her my reasons, but she kept shuting me up and talking louder. At the end she asked me if I hate kids, or why I did this. \n\nThis is the part where I think I could be the asshole, because I answered that, after basically raising my brothers and cousins, I just too tired to even think on having my own children, I dont want to live that again, I want to be free and have my own life. \n\nMy mom didnt answered, instead she slapped me in the face, looked at me disgusted and left. \n\nNow all the family knows about it, and most of them are sending me texts and calls, acussing me of being selfish, that I did this to hurt my parents, that I hate my family, that I'm evil, etc. \n\nI dont hate my brothers or my cousins, and I dont hate kids, I just dont want to have children and want to have my own life. Is this really that bad? Am I really that evil?

As I'm the older one among my brothers and cousins (my first cousin was born when I was 7, and my first brother when I was 8), since I was 10 I was always their nanny and basically helped a lot to raise all of them (2 brothers, 7 cousins), to the point my parents bragged about how I was an expert changing diapers, feeding and taking care of them at 13 (I still dont know if that was something worth to be proud about). \n\nMy problem is that a nurse from that hospital recognized my last name, she went to tell everything to my aunt, and she told it to my mom. So, the day I went back home, she came and we had a figth about it. \n\nShe acussed me of being awfull and selfish, saying things that I had no rigth to take that desition and that I took away her dream of being a grandmother, that I was insane and I will regret doing this. I tried to explain her my reasons, but she kept shuting me up and talking louder. At the end she asked me if I hate kids, or why I did this. \n\nThis is the part where I think I could be the asshole, because I answered that, after basically raising my brothers and cousins, I just too tired to even think on having my own children, I dont want to live that again, I want to be free and have my own life. \n\nMy mom didnt answered, instead she slapped me in the face, looked at me disgusted and left. \n\nNow all the family knows about it, and most of them are sending me texts and calls, acussing me of being selfish, that I did this to hurt my parents, that I hate my family, that I'm evil, etc. \n\nI dont hate my brothers or my cousins, and I dont hate kids, I just dont want to have children and want to have my own life. Is this really that bad? Am I really that evil? Am I wrong? \n\nPlease, I swear I'll accept any result, just tell me, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m the oldest of 6 and empathize with you on being tired of children. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have any myself since I was the second mom and often left in charge from a very young age. Even now they still come to me with their issues. It\u2019s exhausting as hell. Also, report that nurse. She absolutely violated your privacy. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "Girl. HIPAA - get that nurse fired!", "CALL THE HOSPITAL AND REPORT THAT NURSE!!!!\n\nIf you live in the U.S. She broke the law. HIPAA is the law for a reason and her telling your family your medical business is illegal.\n\nGet. Her. Fired. No pity, no mercy.", "NTA. You need to make a formal complaint about the nurse who decided it was ok to divulge your personal information to other people. Massive breach of data protection and extremely unprofessional. Your mother sounds delightful.", "NTA\n\nIf this is the US then you should report that nurse for violating HIPAA.  Don't hesitate, don't feel bad for her either.  Who knows  how many other people she has put through unnecessary grief because she has a big fat mouth and is a gossip?  Or will in the future.\n\nEven if not the US, I can't imagine that it is considered ethical to divulge a patients private health information to anyone.  Report her. It shouldn't be. She needs to be held accountable for what she has done.  \n\nYou have one life to live and a good part of it was helping your parents and aunts and uncles raise their children, so you aren't selfish. They were.  Ignore them. They are wrong. Let their nasty comments wash over you.  Block them if they are incessant.  It's not selfish, it's self preservation.  It's not evil. It's not to hurt your parents, it's so you can finally be happy and free from caring for babies and kids. Not everyone wants to be a parent.  Too many who are shouldn't be.  \n\nI hope you never ever babysit for any of those people ever again.", "Agree with everyone else\u2019s comments. Also please please please call the hospital administration and report the nurse. She can be fired for what she did.", "It is absolutely not your responsibility to have children because other people want them. Children take up a lot of time and effort, it is not something that everybody wants. I think living child free has different benefits to having children, and people's preferences will help them figure out whether having children is for them. Your mother is not entitled to grandchildren, nobody but you gets to make a decision about what you use your body for. Most definitely NTA", "NTA, NTA, NTA.  But your mother sure is, your aunt sure is, and that F\\*\\*\\*ing nurse at the hospital is not only the AH, she'd be lucky to keep her job after I was through with her.  While I know you are not in the US, I'm willing to bet there are privacy laws that were violated when she told your aunt.  Who could not keep her big mouth shut and immediately went to your mother.  \n\nYour mother basically parentified you and now she's shocked you don't want kids of your own.    She thinks you're selfish but you spent your teenage years raising her kids.  Who's the selfish one?  I'd tell your mother that slap was her one free shot at you, if she ever raises a finger against you or tries to tell you how to live your life again, it will be the last time she ever sees or hears from you.  Thank your aunt for her big mouth.  Tell her how much you enjoyed her blabbing everything to your mother and if this is the way she shows her appreciation for you helping to raise her kids, you don't need her in your life anymore.  Then call a lawyer and ask him how much you should sue the hospital who gave out your medical information to someone who is not entitled to it.  \n\nYou are not bad, evil, selfish, or wrong.  You are entitled to live your life as you choose.  And anyone who can't grasp that should be cut out of your life.", "NTA. Your mother has no right to expect you to have children because it's YOUR life, not hers and it will affect you the most. She has other children that could give her grandchildren so her reaction was not only abusive (and frankly that's assault), but over the top. Plus SHE'S the one being selfish, expecting you to upend your life and dreams just so she can have grandchildren from you.\n\nI don't know where you live but that nurse violated HIPAA (in the USA) or your medical right to privacy by telling other people about your medical procedure.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. I respect your decision. You should report the nurse as well.", "NTA--sue the hospital, patient confidentiality exists for a reason", "Children are HARD, suck the life and money out of you, take your freedom and most of your sanity. And I\u2019m a mom who desperately wanted to be one.  Being a parent doesn\u2019t make anyone a hero. I applaud people who know whether it\u2019s the right path and not choose it if it\u2019s not.  It\u2019s a huge life altering decision that should only be made by you. \nNTA.  Fk that nurse.  Report her immediately.  And fk any family members that guilt you into thinking your life should be lived as they want.  Do they plan to stay up all night with the baby?  Pay for daycare, school, college?  No? Then stf right up.", "NTA \n\nFirst block all the people shaming you for this.  It's none of their business.  Second,  report that nurse immediately if you haven't and think about contacting a lawyer for a consultation.", "NTA  \nReport the nurse immediately. Sue her, sue the hospital. I'm not big on filing lawsuits for small things... but THIS is not a small thing! The nurse violated the law. And shame on your family, too. I'm so sorry they were awful to you for YOUR decision about YOUR body.", "No one who is even hesitant about having children should have them. You do you. They made you a parent as a child. They\u2019re the selfish ones.", "NTA. Your mom is a parasite with extreme narcissism.", "NTA.  Your reason for not wanting kids is extremely valid.  You owe no one kids as it\u2019s non of their business.  Your mother deserved to be told the truth and her hitting you is assault so I\u2019d report her to the police for that. In fact if she assaults people then she is the last person who should be near children. I\u2019d happily go live your life by going non or low contact with anyone who does not respect your decision.", "NTA you need to report the nurse and go NC with your family until they start acting better.", "Nta- please report that nurse. What happened is 10000% a HIPPA violation.", "NTA, and if you don\u2019t want kids, I applaud the fact that you would actually do something to prevent having kids instead of doing nothing and bringing a child into this world that you didn\u2019t want.  I know it\u2019s your mom, but she needs to be slapped across the face for slapping you as a 26 year old woman.   You don\u2019t live your life for her!  You live your life for you.  You are the one who deals with the consequences of your choices, not her.", "NTA and the only people being selfish here are your family. They aren\u2019t owed grandchildren and no one should be out there having kids just to appease other family members sense of entitlement. Secondly, the family member that snitched on you ought to be reported and I hope they lose their job. They also are the definition of selfish.", "NTA your body, your life, your choice and honestly, what you did was the most selfless thing to do, no one is own children and grandchildren but children are owed parents could want them and give the all the love, warmth and resources and support, and if you can't give that...", "NTA but your mother is mean and that nurse needs to lose her job.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her grandchildren. You don\u2019t have to have kids. Kudos to you for knowing that you do t want them. I wish more people would think before they breed. \nYou need to contact a lawyer and sue. The nurse broke all sorts of HPPA laws doing that. Take the settlement and run.", "Sue the crap out of that hospital", "NTA- no, you were parentified to the point of exhaustion. Your family is awful. You should report that nurse and you should have your mother arrested for assault. Please get away from your family and go NC. You deserve to live your life for yourself.", " NTA. I hope you reported that nurse for violating your privacy", "NTA. You were parentified, then had your medical history blabbed (for that alone, I'd burn that nurse's employment to the ground because wtf??), and your mother slapped you in the face because you opted not to be a brood mare for her grandparent dreams. Which likely include having babies around that she doesn't have to take care of, like she did with you.\n\nIf I were you, I would honestly just not talk to anyone, but I can cut people off easy and that's an easy thing for me to say. \"If you think I'm so evil by not wanting to propagate, then maybe you should just stay out of my single, not-having kids life because you drained any will to have my own children by making me a parent as a child. I'm done. I raised all your kids. Consider them your grandchildren. You're welcome.\"\n\nAlso, btw, if you have siblings, they can also have kids. Oh wow, funny how that works.", "NTA. Your body, your choice.\n\nYou know who YTA is? The nurse. Should be reported.", "NTA", "NTA your body your choice. You dont need to give any reason or justifiy yourself to anyone.

You have a winning case.", "Let me get this straight.\n\nYou had a childhood where you were parentified for the entire second half.\n\nA nurse told your family about you getting your tubes tied (which was against the law, by the way).\n\nYour mother won't listen to reason because she thinks you owe her grandkids.\n\nYou stand up to your mother and she responds with physical violence.\n\nYeah definitely NTA.", "The nurse broke the law.

But your Mom and that nurse are. Depending on where you live,  you might be able to sue.", "NTA. First step, report the nurse who told your private information. She deserves to lose her job. \n\nTwo, I had my tubes removed. Keep in mind that having them tied does mean they can untie themselves, which is why my doctor full removed mine.

I\u2019ve never wanted kids so I did what I needed to do to ensure it never happened. \n\nI\u2019ve been called selfish and told that I\u2019ll regret my decision.

I have been trying to get this for about 2 years", "Yeah, that was my thought. Sue now. That is an unbelievable HIPPA violation. And no way you're the first one she's had. Report it if nothing else.

It's because I think some moms think that what they went through needs to be passed on through their bloodline/female lineage and they get really salty when the women they birthed refuse to bear children.
