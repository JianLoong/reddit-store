They did not treat me the way a parent should treat their kid. They were much better with my siblings. Not perfect. But they made the effort to give them love, show them kindness, and to provide for them. I don't know why I was different. And I can't say whether I could be an affair baby or not. I don't care to find out. I cut all ties with my parents when I was 17 and my boyfriend, now husband's, family was willing to let me live with them. They saw how bad my life was at home. Heck, they fed me more often than my parents did. Most of the time anything I did get to eat at my parents I was berated for costing them money, time and effort. It was never ending.\n\nMy parents also liked to drink. It happened often enough that you could easily call it a problem but I know it got worse after I moved out. My siblings told me it wasn't ever that bad and they were happy with our parents. But they could also acknowledge that our parents treated me like trash and never should have been allowed to keep custody of me.\n\nExcept now the drinking has caused problems with both my parents health and my siblings are taking care of them. And they want me to do my part as well. They want us all to prepare for the future if they need more round the clock care and they want us to plan for their funerals when they inevitably die without anything arranged for themselves. They said as the oldest and the most stable I am in the better position to help.\n\nI told them while I love them, it would forever haunt me if I helped care for our parents after the shitty life and treatment they gave me. I told them they do not deserve it and I deserve better than to be left making sure they're taken care of. I told them they could always choose to do nothing as well or they can choose to accept that they are going to take the weight of the responsibility for them (our parents). But that it would be cruel to expect me to make sure my parents are treated better than they treated me, that they have more dignity than they ever allowed me. I told them if I had become very sick as a kid I would have been lucky to see a doctor, let alone have my parents pay the money to care for me. None of them denied that. But they all (all 4) said I should do it for them, for the love I have for them and how hard it is.\n\nThey're mad I said no. They were even more mad when I told them my primary obligation is to my husband and our unborn son who will be here next year and not our parents.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703085699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mx27s/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_siblings_care_for/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have your priorities straight. May all three of you live long and prosper.", "Tell them you\u2019re willing to provide for them the way they did for you. You\u2019d be happy to show them how it felt. \n\nStay with your choice. These aren\u2019t your parents, they are your egg-/sperm donor and abuser.

Take care of your own family.", "NTA \nYour are under no obligation to help them at all, your parents should have already put the money aside or gotten insurance to pay for their later in life, and yes I know many people fail to do this throughout their lives. Congratulations on your son and best wishes for the delivery.", "NTA - Your parents abandoned you, you didn't leave them.  So the choice of you being involved with their needs later in life was theirs to make and they made it already, so sad.  You owe them or your siblings nothing at this point.  They made their beds and now must lie in them.  Don't let your siblings try to guilt trip you, you have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.   Maybe send them a little bouquet and just wish them good luck on their new journey in life.", "NTA. Obviously your family is the priority.

I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about not helping people who treated me like shit, leave your siblings to deal with it.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. I get it, OP. A lot of this was very similar to the things I experienced. In my family, we do the whole take care of your abusers at the end of their life thing, but I refused. I didn't drop everything to take care of my dad when his addiction got out of control. I didn't pay his rent, give him money, anything while everyone else enabled him. I've been judged pretty harshly for it, but my personal peace remains intact because of it. \n\nI've told everyone for years that the only one I will take care of is my aunt, who was truly like a 3rd parent to me. She has always taken care of me, helped me with a car when my own parents wouldn't, etc. Any time I've needed a bail out, she's provided it. For that reason, she can live with me and I'll change her diapers one day. Because she poured into me without just taking.\n\nIt's unfortunate that it's such a struggle for your siblings but that still isn't your problem. They choose to take on this burden so the only responsibility lies with them. If it's too much, maybe a state placement is on order if they truly can't care for themselves. There are options every single step of the way that don't require you more from you than they ever gave.

Your resources need to go to your family.  It is only fair.", "NTA. In the normal way of life our parents love and care for us and eventually we provide them with the love and care they need. Your parents neglected you and deserve to get back what they gave. \n\nYour siblings are being unfair to expect more from you.", "NTA - You are 100% right.\n\nI will say however that your siblings have a point that you are the oldest and in the most stable position to help, though I'd also note that this doesn't mean you are obliged to do so. Not doing so, on the other hand, could strain relations with them so you need to consider that carefully.\n\nIf it were me I would maybe think about a compromise/middle ground such as refusing to take care for them in life and contributing to their funerary service as a gesture of goodwill to your siblings and to ease their burden as well as show through action that you're a better person than your parents ever were. I'd do this just out of care for my siblings and for want of maintaining a relationship with them.\n\nWhatever you decide, know that you are correct about your priorities and that you have the freedom in this situation to do as you please.", "YTA. The first child always gets treated the worst, that's the way of the world. Your parents were likely young, inexperienced and your arrival changed their life in the most dramatic way. Also the expectations are the highest for the firstborn, so you had to adhere to a much higher standard. And it could be that in their opinion you didn't fare that well. \n\nThey took care of you and paid for all your expenses for 17 years straight, therefore financial support is the bare minimum that should be expected in this case, I agree with your siblings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Firstborn children don't deserve abuse and neglect simply because their parents' lives changed due to having them or because the parents had \"higher expectations\" than they might for children they had later. That they provided enough care for OP to survive childhood isn't something OP needs to be grateful for -- parents are legally and morally required to do that at the absolute minimum, and again, it was their choice to be parents, so it's not a debt OP owes them, it's something they willingly signed up for when they had OP.\n\nI'd also like to point out that you're speculating wildly on WHY the parents didn't support or treat OP well. There's no indication that they were very young when they had OP or that OP failed to live up to their expectations. All we know is that OP was neglected by parents who have substance abuse problems to the point that she left home before she was legally an adult and hasn't had contact since then.

From my perspective it is a choice to have children, nobody asks to be born. If parents chose to have children, they also have a legal responsibility to raise them with a certain standard of care (I can only speak to this being true in the US, but I assume similar laws exist in other countries). So why would having children they chose to birth and raise, establish a debt of care owed to the parents from the child that never had a choice in being born? Seems like if someone wants to be cared for in their time of need as they age, they should make sure they don't neglect that child and raise them with love and kindness, so that child is willing to return that love and kindness by caring for their parents while they age. Seems like parents that neglect their children have made their bed and will face consequences for their neglect.", "If they couldn't even manage the minimum ethical responsibility to their child, why does that child owe a \"minimum ethical responsibility\" to them, especially when they have 4 other children who do want to help? They weren't parents to him", "Oh, so then I should totally make sure my bio dad is well taken care of for the simple pleasure of being abused by him for 15 years before getting away?
