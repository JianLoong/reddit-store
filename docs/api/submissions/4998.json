A moment when the fact the world is still turning, that other people are continuing with their lives and work and eating and laughing..it feels absolutely inconceivable.

They even encouraged her to keep the engagement ring if she wanted it for keepsake. \n\nMy point in sharing this is to hopefully show you that it is 100% okay to do what is best for you.

It sounds like your bf is in a Persistent Disorder of Consciousness and will not \u201ccome back\u201d to who he was before. So while he is still here, you have to grieve his loss.

We're trying to deal with that. We'd started planning our wedding. Our wedding fund is gone. All of our savings are gone because he couldn't work (still can't as his neurologist won't clear him until he undergoes further testing) and I had to leave my job at the time, an incredibly well paying job as a retail sales consultant. I had to drop down to basic retail part time to help look after him. \n\nBelieve me when I say every single cent we had saved, is gone. It went on rent, groceries, bills, and, he got sick right before Christmas so I also had to take out a small loan to cover that.
