It is sad that she is in such denial about his situation but you have gone  way beyond what most would do in this situation. \n\n  Nothing is going to change for the better if you keep on as you are now.  Each day he doesn't wake up the chances of it ever happening greatly decreases.  \n\n Don't let her guilt you into giving up on your life, your dreams too.", "While you very much love your BF, he is not the same person anymore, nor ever will be. You are too young to put your life on hold. NTA and no one should judge you for going to see him and making your peace with him and walking away (make sure his mother is not there, tell her you want to see him alone). Then, don't even say anything to his mother. She's afraid of losing her son and isn't thinking straight. She would just say more hateful things to you making you feel guilty. Even though you were going to marry him, you aren't married and not responsible for him. Take the job, move, start the healing process of losing someone so dear, and start the next chapter of your life.", "MTA  He is already gone.  If his brain activity is minimal, then he is no longer there.  His mother may not be able to face this.  You understand this, and this does not make you a bad person.   Grieve his loss and move on.", "NTA\n\nfrom what you\u2019re saying, he\u2019s sadly not him anymore. Semi comatose??\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t want you to waste your life when he\u2019s not going to be able to live a life with you.\n\nYou\u2019re only 25. You deserve a full life.\n\nTake the job and move.", "NTA. He may be living but he\u2019s gone from you. It\u2019s a horrible situation but it\u2019s not one that you could reasonably perpetuate indefinitely, regardless of the promises you made each other when you were together. For him as well you should live your dreams.", "NTA... I am sorry. I believe that his parents are holding onto the belief that things may change for the better. You moving, closes that book.\n\nYou were very close, but you were not married. The man you loved has changed forever. Please, move on. Get settled and get counseling, this is a trauma that you need help sorting through", "NTA\n\nYou also need to start therapy if you haven\u2019t already to deal with these feelings of guilt for trying to better your life. \n\nEssentially, he\u2019s gone. Not getting better or worse. \n\nOnce again, therapy. You will need it. \n\nIt\u2019s been two years. How long will you wait for him? Do you want kids? A partner to have an active and comforting role in your life?\n\nIt\u2019s ok to move on. To move away. To eventually open yourself to the possibility of finding another love.\n\nJust bc he is comatose does not mean your life forever needs to reflect that. \n\nIt might be easier to stop talking to his mum. Start gradually going less, say your goodbyes, take the job and move and consider it a fresh start\u2019", "NTA\n\nYour life is not to be wasted as a full time caretaker for a vegetable.", "Life cannot be put on hold forever. It\u2019s tragic but true. NTA.", "NTA. If I ever get into an accident which leaves me in a vegetative state I'd want my partner to be able to live her life, and remember me as I am now.", "NTA. Live your life, hun.", "NTA his mother knows he will never get better and you\u2019re her best chance at not having to be his caregiver for the rest of his life.", "Your remaining will not change the medical outcome for your boyfriend. Nothing will.\n\nHe made poor choices which had awful consequences for all of you.\n\nYour moving will greatly improve your life.", "Nta. This is a tragedy for everyone, you included. You are only 25 and your life is just starting. If you stay and give up work and family then all of you are lost. You are right, you have to move on. I'm so sorry for all of you.", "NTA\n\nHoney, take the new job and get therapy.  \n\nIt is tragic what's happening to him, and the guilt feels real, but life moves on.  Maybe he'll come back and the two of you can see what can or should be salvaged then.  \n\nMaybe he won't come back.\n\nHis mom is drowning on dry land and lashing out because of it.  That's not your fault.  She doesn't have the right to lash out at you for it, nor does she have the right to anchor you to a hospital bed.  Frankly, even if he comes back, and even if you two rekindle, stay away from her.  \n\nIt sounds like you've been trying and grieving for a long time, and that's because you're a good person, but this isn't safe.", "NTA\n\nWhat are you supposed to do? What does she actually expect you to do? He is not *him* anymore. That's not anyone's fault, it's just an unfortunate, excruciatingly painful truth! One you already have to live with. You already have to mourn the life you were supposed to have together and now never will. \n\nSo what does she want, really, for you to stay there by his bedside and wither away too???! He's gone. You are not. She should want you to move on. To find a way to be happy and live your best life! \n\nI understand that she's grieving, but so are you. While they are very different,  neither is less powerful than the other. She has lost her son. You have lost the love of your life. \n\n\nUnfortunately I understand how you feel. It's a pain that never goes away. We just find a way to move forward. To let ourselves be happy again. To open ourselves back up to joy, and eventually even love. Never losing our love for them. They would understand, us moving on. \n\nYou are not abandoning him. You have no reason to be conflicted. You have done everything you can do. You need to take care of yourself and put your needs first now. This job will be good for you. Good luck. I hope everything works out. I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA.   I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.  Your fianc\u00e9 died but is still living.   Please get help to process these complex emotions and this horrible situation.  But ultimately your life is ahead of you and you must move on.  I think the previous comment regarding the parents wanting you to take over care are valid concerns.   I\u2019m so sorry.", "This. OP, I would do something to make peace with the fact that your BF is gone, at least your BF the way you knew him, cut off his parents, and move on with your life. Date when you're ready. Find hobbies and friends in your new town, and don't feel bad. It's time to move on.", "If he would want you to stick around forever, he wasn't on your side, either.", "NTA.  just ask yourself, if your roles were reversed and you were in his place...would you want him to go on and live a fulfilling  happy life or stay by your side when there is really nothing he can do for you?", "Not sure why you got downvoted. Everyone else sympathized with both OP and mom.", "Yes, there are documents you can have filed that give very explicit directions as to what your wishes are should specific medical decisions need to be made and you're unable to make them due to your current state.", "This all just reminds me of an awful court case in Florida that got a lot of publicity where this woman was in a similar state to what op has described her boyfriend and her husband ended up getting in a drawn out legal battle with her parents about whether she should be removed from life support. The parents were convinced that she could still hear them and was reacting to them, the doctors were saying \"that's just random firings of neurons in her brain she cannot hear you and is not reacting to you\" and the poor husband just wanted to give his wife a dignified death so he and their kids could actually grieve and move on but they woman's parents dragged it out for well over a decade. \n\nOP, I'm sorry for your loss. But sweetie, he's likely gone. No one should expect you to put your whole life on hold on the very small chance that he recovers. You dont love him, who he is now. You love the memory of him. He's not there anymore. You are experiencing survivor's guilt, and I think you could benefit from exploring counseling options. He is no longer the person you fell in love with, and never will be again. In addition, *you* are not the person you used to be. The past two years have changed you, and you have grown as a person to become who you are now. He has not been able to grow with you. If something like this happened to me, I would want my partner to have a life. If there's no guarantee I'm ever going to come back I want him to find love again, be happy again, look back and love my memory, but live again. Asking anything else of him would be selfish. You're barely quarter of a century old and you're considering putting everything you've ever dreamed of aside to be a nursemaid for someone who is never going to know you're there? That's not a life. You deserve better. \n\nThe cynical part of me thinks your boyfriend's mother doesn't want you to leave because she wants you to take over his care. You deserve to live again, and not have this shackled to you for the rest of your life. Is this what you want for the next 50 years?", "All of which won't be considered by paramedics on a snowy mountainside. There is no way for the paramedics that hook you up on oxygen to know whether you're unconscious from blood loss, pain from your broken bones, or because you're in a vegatetative state. Also, many people wake with no long-term ill effects after being in a coma for a few hours. By the time the patient is stable and docters confer with the family, the story will be \"There's a good chance he wakes from this coma, we have no way to know how much brain trauma there is\". And absolutely zero 23-year olds would want to write \"Pull the plug on me in that case\".", "There's a kid who just passed a few months ago after 3 years of being kept alive when he really wasn't there. The parents wanted to end his suffering but the dad's parents manipulated them and got them to keep trying new treatments, even though he had very little of his brain left. Literally he was on automatic, and most of his brain became spinal fluid. \n\n\nI feel for OP. I can't imagine going through that.", "I think you\u2019re talking about Terri Schiavo? That was really awful.", "None of that is relevant. An AD can come into play once you are stabilized and in a hospital- it's not a DNR. If your AD states no prolonged and sustained life saving measures, then yes, you can be taken off life support at that time. If BF is paralyzed, then I doubt he is breathing on his own.", "i'm 26 but at 23 i would have done that for sure", "You'd sign 'pull the plug on me if I'm unconscious, but have a 50% chance of reviving without any disability'?", "that's a different situation than what you described previously, but even then, i'd consider it. i don't want to be a burden to my family if there's only a 50% chance of me ever waking up, with no reason to think it will be any time soon. i wouldn't want myself or anyone else stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt on my account.", "Where do you get that statistic? \n\nAs someone who is disabled, yes, I would sign that paper. I can't imagine being semi-comatose and waking up fully paralyzed would lead to a 50% chance of a full recovery."]}
