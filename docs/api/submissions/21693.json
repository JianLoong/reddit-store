My family is large and it was not possible for my parents to get all of our seats together. It turned out I was sitting next to a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who started telling me about how Chinese people are trying to flood America with immigrants to destroy our values. But on my other side was a man who had been a missionary for a different religion in China and was passionate about how Chinese people are wonderful people and he was pissed. They got into it and I just slumped down in the middle seat and did my sudoku\u2026 it was incredibly awkward.

People that are prepared to ask other people for a favor, and potentially inconvenient favor, should be prepared for a \u201cno.\u201d \n\nYou should always trade same or better level and be prepared to offer some form of consideration if  lesser. Case in point, offered a mom and infant a first class seat on the window side in return for the one next to my wife. Win-win for all. Conversely, I had an elderly woman sitting in my aisle seat (which I booked for my bad leg) who then proceeded to tell me she needed an aisle seat because she is old and had a bad leg. Flight attendant walked off as she didn\u2019t want to be involved. I would have offered my seat since she\u2019s old, but the fact that she decided for me pissed me off to no end.

We had booked these seats months in advance and ordered meals ahead of time. Someone from a different row got there before us and decided they wanted our window seat and acted like we were nuts when we asked them to move out of the seat that we paid extra for.

It's never let's trade aisle for aisle seat. Also I don't want you talking the whole time, ideally they'd separate all couples. Anyone who talks on the plane should have to walk the plank imo.\n\nThe only time I'll take the L on something like this is if it's a parent wanting to sit next to their kid, which is still annoying but whatever, I'll do it, and thankfully this rarely happens because they know to reserve their seats properly.", "That is the oldest trick in the book.
