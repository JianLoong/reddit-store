He wanted the extra room for free. \n\nYou are not obliged to switch seats. If he really wanted to, he would have paid up.", "NTA hahahaha.  I love this.  When you pay extra for a better seat and some random person in the back wants to \"trade\" you are under ZERO obligation to trade.  Why shouldn't they pay the extra...\n\nRecently I asked to trade seats with someone so I could sit next to my traveling companion.  Same aisle seat.  They got to move one row closer.  Thats a pretty fair trade.  But they didn't have to say yes.", "Next time I'm going up to first class to tell them to be a nice person one by one. Try my luck.", "NTA at all. I mean $200 is a bit steep but he should have paid for connected seats. I literally cannot stand these people who purchase the least expensive tickets with no assigned seats and then bank on other travelers generosity. I always prepay for my seat and I'm not going to give it up just because somebody is a cheapskate.", "The only time I ever asked to swap was because we had to fly back as an emergency as my mother in law was on her deathbed. We booked seats the night before, so we couldn\u2019t be together. I asked if we could swap the middle seat for either the aisle or window seat so I could sit with my son (aged 8) and they said no bother. Then they offered to swap with my daughter in the row behind so the three of us could be together - I didn\u2019t ask but I was very grateful. I wouldn\u2019t have been angry if they\u2019d said no, but for a 5-hour flight with an 8-year old I think we\u2019re all better off with us next to one another!\n\nRambling message, but NTA", "NTA. your seat was paid for with extra leg room. if he wanted that seat he could've booked it earlier, in my experience the extra leg room seats are mostly prebooked", "NTA.  This is hilarious.\n\n\nHe said a \u2018nice person\u2019 would switch just because he asked?  Yeah, what he actually meant was \u2018doormat.\u2019", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t upgrade to a better and more expensive seat expecting somebody will just give it to you. Their best bet would be to have the wife move to the cheaper seat and that person could get a free upgrade if they are \u201cnice.\u201d", "Nta.  \n\nHe could  have asked his seatmate to sit in wife's spot.  Or maybe they said no too\ud83d\ude42\n\nYour dad paid extra. He can too if he wants a better  seat", "NTA. I've been hearing stories about this happening more and more, where people try to pressure other people to change seats with them so they can sit with their family/traveling companions. Conveniently, it's you trading your nicer seat for their not so nice seat. I remember one lady in my row was getting on, and I got out of the seat to let her in (I was in the aisle seat and she was in the middle seat), and she was like 'oh it's okay, we're all in the same row so you can just scoot in to my seat'. I was like 'Oh, no that's okay.' Like lady, I paid for the aisle seat so I can go pee easier. I'm not getting trapped in the middle.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Too many people are asking people to switch seats on planes. It's time they accepted, if they didn't get the seat they wanted, too bad.", "Lolololololol NTA this is amazing", "It was a Scam. You scammed the scammed NTA!", "NTA\n\nNow that airlines CHARGE for nicer seats, the real assholes are those who expect people to trade a seat they (or someone) likely paid extra money for a crappier seat. If you don\u2019t care enough to PAY to sit next to your family/spouse/whatever then live with your shitty seat and leave other passengers alone.", "NTA. Well, maybe a little bit but in a fun way so I\u2019m okay with it.", "NTA, Why didn\u2019t his wife trade places with someone?!", "NTA if he wanted the seat.  He could have paid for it himself.", "NTA seat switchers are the worsttttt", "LOL Great idea! Why shouldn't you be compensated? When I fly, I pay for better seats. I would have to make some serious cash to switch seats.", "It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s these  \u2018fee hungry\u2019 airlines. They make people pay for everything extra. \nIf people want preferred seats (and yes, sitting together with another family member is a preference) then he needs to cough up the extra $$$. You are well within your rights to refuse.", "NTA\n\nIf it were a regular seat then yeah that's shitty (even then you are within your rights to say no) but this is an upgraded seat that was paid for your comfort by your dad. 200$ is much, I would have told them a straight-up no or to pay the difference. Either way, you aren't obligated to switch seats especially when you pay extra for a specific one.", "Nta money moves the seats", "NTA", "200 USD is literally a full ticket to a lot of destinations within Europe.\n\nESH. Him for asking for a better seat instead of upgrading someone else, you because you could have said no or asked for something less. Or asked your dad if he wanted any compensation, him being the person who paid more, not you. You sound like a scalper.", "NAH tbh. I can see why he's offended given *the amount* that you suggested probably made it sound like you were joking in an asshole way. Like \"haha maybe when pigs fly\". It probably just seemed unnecessary to him and that's why he was offended. NTA for not trading seats tho or wanting money for it if you do", "NTA. You had an item he wanted and you set your price, outrageous though it may have been. It was an airplane seat, not insulin.", "$200 whoa dude wtf\n\nHow much extra did the seat cost your dad?", "YTA.  Your mom was right.", "Asking $200 seems a bit high but then again about 15 years ago someone paid me $100 to switch seats. I didn\u2019t ask for the money but certainly didn\u2019t say no.", "NTA. You are NEVER obligated to change your seat. I never do UNLESS the seat is equal or better than my seat.  Since your seat was upgraded, no need to move. He could have asked the guy next to him to change with his wife but he wanted an upgraded seat for free.", "If they were regular seats and there wasn't anything wrong with where he was sitting then I'd say your TA but since this is obviously economy vs coach or whatever the airline calls it  hell no you are NTA. You want me to downgrade so you can sit next to your wife? No and clearly this was a ploy to buy one coach ticket and get one free by pulling on someone's heart/empathy strings.", "I was on a flight recently and a kid screamed for his daddy the entire flight. \n\n\nHis dad was sleeping in a different row. \n\n\nPretty sure the woman sitting next to the kid and mom would have switched but the dad didn\u2019t even ask.\nAlso, I hate flying.

It comes across as bizarrely aggressive to ask for freaking $200 over a seat swap. Of course OP isn't obligated, but they took it a bit far when they tried to charge for it.", "As OP pointed out 3 times, his dad paid for the seat. Would OP have shared his profit with his dad?\n\nI'm thinking NAH. I can understand the other passenger's frustration with being asked for $200 to swap seats. It doesn't sound like he screamed or caused a scene. It wasn't a nice interaction, but it wasn't too bad.", "Sometimes the seats really are that much extra. Depends on airline and destination", "So in other words not \"THE\" asshole, but kind of \"an\" asshole....saying no is one thing, gouging somebody, almost like the airlines do, is kinda a dick move.", "I bet he wouldn\u2019t have said the \u201cnice\u201d part to a man.", "Someone tried to take my window seat the same way, she said we were blocking up the aisle so I should just sit in her seat. I paid extra to pick my seat, I wasn\u2019t going to get tricked out of it.", "Seriously it really irks me for some reason", "Scalper is better than trying to get a better seat for free", "So the seat that was paid extra for should be given away for free?", "Why can\u2019t the wife move?

He was in an upgraded seat, as was I.  I told him I would take his seat and his kid could take my seat and he could take his other kid's middle seat in the back of the plane. Not surprisingly, he didn't like that.
