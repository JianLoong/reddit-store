Got it.", "It was entitled. Imagine a well-dressed man coming up to you in the grocery store and asking you to give him a bag of groceries you've just bought because he likes them.\n\nThis is exactly the same - a person feels entitled to get for free what the other person has paid for. For some unknown reason. It's like usual norms of decency don't exist on the planes.", ">As OP pointed out 3 times, his dad paid for the seat. Would OP have shared his profit with his dad?\n\nI don't even want to guess the extent of your daddy problems.", "And I bet it was his idea. That's why the wife was in the better seat.", "Instead of taking a 17 hour direct flight, I took a layover and 3 extra hours of flying bc that direct flight only had middle seats.  I just couldn\u2019t do it. Of course, I was still miserable by the time I got to my destination :)", "Would he even have asked to switch if OP is a guy? \n\nI'm only like now realizing how much people, even, if not especially, my own family, seem perfectly fine with me being as uncomfortable as possible because I'm a short woman. I'm 36 years old and am just starting to stick up for my own space (yes, that's kind of sad). I'm kind of sick of tall people acting like they have some sort of disability that I have to be responsible for.", "Ten for that? You must be mad!", "Nah, not an asshole.", "Yes. Why would that be any different? You chose to have kids. You chose to bring your kids on the trip. You chose not to pay to sit together. I agree that it\u2019s on the airlines, but until that changes, then yes. You have to pay.", "Yes, no matter who you are, if you want to sit together sometimes that means paying for it. If you\u2019re flying in main cabin (not first or business class) a lot of airlines, like Delta, lets you pick your seats at no extra charge. If you choose to fly a cheaper airline that doesn\u2019t let you pick your seat for free then that\u2019s a choice you made.", "You paid $171 on top of the ticket price?", "Is it possible they only paid for one upgraded seat and figured the person next to the wife would cave under some misplaced/ingrained social pressure? Seems like a lot of effort though. So if they did, they\u2019ve definitely won stupid prizes.  \n\nAssuming OP was travelling in the US, are you not able to say something like \u201cwindow seat please\u201d or \u201c2 seats together, if possible\u201d on check-in for domestic flights? Or select your seat from a map of available seats if you\u2019re checking in electronically?", "There was a show on one of the food networks where they did that, but they BOUGHT the bag of groceries. And they had to offer people more and more money to get bags that looked good to them from the outside. Even on tv they know you can\u2019t just take someone\u2019s groceries.", "I almost hope I run into these people when I travel now because I\u2019ve gotten so good at saying no, being stern, and giving no fucks. (In a quiet way of course.) I was a doormat for so long and it feels good lol", "As a 5\u20191 woman I feel this so hard", "That's right.  Either do it or don't.", "Yuuup, I think it was 150 for the first flight and 20 something for the return.", "How long was the flight? I hope it was a short one for that price.", "Dang, I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s gotten that expensive. I used to fly all the time but it was for work and they paid.", "I mean i flew for 28hours (with 2 layovers) for 250$. Id gladly have taken 50$ for a middle seat :p", "it was like an hour lol i honestly thought it was a steal", "I\u2019m too old and my body hurts too much for those flights lol", "Oh that\u2019s a fantastic deal!", "I love this! Both parties happy with the outcome."]}
