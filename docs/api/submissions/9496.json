I agree that this diet seems bad.\n\nThat also doesn't at all matter. OP knew the kid was exposed to very few foods. OP decided she knew best for someone else's kid. \n\nThe diet is negligent but so is giving someone else's kid a peanut when you do not know if they are allergic. That is completely not an aunt decision. Nor would it be an aunt's decision to change any aspect of someone else's kid's diet. \n\nThe way someone expresses concern over the child's well being is not to go behind a well meaning parent's back and give them a potentially dangerous food. OP could have expressed this verbally and if the sister didn't listen then change approach. OP could have presented the sister with research on why the diet is not ideal. OP could have asked that the sister see a doctor to ask questions about diet for a 3 year old. OP could have even called authorities if all else failed and OP felt it was damaging enough to warrant it. But it really sounds like OP simply disagreed with how the sister was parenting and decided to take the matter into her own hands as though she were the parent and she is not. She had no right to do so. Not even if the food was less likely to be dangerous though it would have been less bad that way.\n\nIt sounds like the mom (her sister) needs to see a therapist about her anxiety potentially if it is truly impacting her child as badly as OP says. That doesn't give OP the right to act in a non urgent situation without trying to respect her sister as a parent first. \n\nEven if the diet the kid is on is bonkers imo. And I'm willing to bet OP would totally agree if it was someone else giving her small child something she didn't approve of.\n\nAnd this isn't some unknowing and unthinking stranger. This is someone who knows but simply disagrees and chose to act on it.", "NTA - Her not exposing him to common allergens may be the cause of the allergy. But more to the point...you didn't know about the allergy and neither did she. You're not wrong for trying to help him branch out. There was no part of this story where your sister said \"don't feed him anything but...\" If there was, that may be a different story because you need to respect parents' wishes. But since she didn't explicitly tell you what not to do, you definitely aren't in the wrong.", "I wonder if OP's sister even brings her child to the pediatrician because you would think a pediatrician would have advised her this was not a healthy diet and would have told her to introduce peanuts early on. There is a pediatric immunologist on tiktok,  Dr Rubin,  who just did a video about this where he advised how to introduce peanuts to a baby. He didn't use actual peanuts, he used a food which had peanut butter as an ingredient.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is ridiculous and it's absurd she hasn't introduced common allergens by AGE THREE. You're supposed to introduce common allergens within the first year! And the fact that the kid doesn't eat mostly solids... WTF? Really, really strange.", "YTA big time. \nIt\u2019s not your decision when a child that isn\u2019t yours should try new foods. They should have tried more at their age but you don\u2019t get to decide that. If you cared to come from an understanding place and ask if you can help because you have experience with it or ask why they\u2019ve chosen the route they\u2019ve taken, I would be happy to see this as a mistake albeit a humungous one. \n\nYou\u2019re aware of her anxieties and instead of just watching the child and returning them, you did something you knew could backfire and create more anxiety. It could have been a safer food but you probably wouldn\u2019t have disclosed giving it. That\u2019s awful. I have anxiety and if someone close to me did this to my 10 month old I would never ever trust them again. Do better to support your sister my goodness. Anxiety isn\u2019t something that just magically goes away when our fears become reality, it pretty much reinforces it and make it even more heightened to avoid something happening again. So good job, she might be pushed to not have the child try foods any sooner now that this happened! \n\nAlso, how sad for that kid. You couldn\u2019t own up and say you felt bad for putting their 3 year old through this?? You sent them to the ER. That had to be pretty scary for them and you just want to be absolved of blame for the whole thing because they \u201cshould have already tried it\u201d?", "NTA. If mom didn\u2019t supply food for him and explicitly say he can only eat what she brought then he eats what you provide. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me that with his lack of food introductions, he becomes an extremely picky eater.", "NTA. \nAs you said, there was no way for you to know that he was allergic and if all the other kids were having some, it would have been unfair to leave him out. \n\nAlthough I personally would have mentioned/asked the parents first, I do not think you deserve to be called an asshole or be made out to be a bad person for an accident.", "NTA my daughter was eating calamari and enjoying it at 3", "[deleted]", "I would say ESH for similar reasons. The mother is T A for not giving the toddler a better diet. But OP is also T A for giving the toddler something that is not part of the usual diet. Even if it didn\u2019t cause an allergy, it could very well irritate the tummy because it\u2019s something new. Also, from OP\u2019s tone, I am betting she baked the cookies with the intent of having the kid ask for one, since she criticized the sister a lot and played the \u201cI am older, I have more kids, I know better, she\u2019s younger, a first time mother\u201d card.", "They recommend giving common allergens like peanuts very early, either by mixing pb or pb powder with baby food or if doing BLW creamy pb on toast right at 6 months. I\u2019m certain this person was referring to that rather than suggesting that a person give a baby a choking hazard that children shouldn\u2019t have until 5 yrs old.", "Obviously I meant exposure to peanut products, not giving a baby a literal peanut to choke on. You give babies a bit of peanut butter to expose them early, which lessens the chance that they'll end up with a peanut allergy.", " Bland white things. Like the mashed potatoes, white bread, chicken nuggets, milk. Nothing with colors like tomatoes, green veggies, carrots, fruit, nuts.", "A diet with little to no nutrients or colour.

The comment above doesn't say to give the baby a bit of peanut to test if they're sensitive. Current scientific research says that giving a child a little bit of common allergens like peanut or egg early on can reduce the likelihood of the child developing an allergy. This is now most paediatricians' recommendation as well.", "Ha right!!! Sounds like the kid summed up in a character\u2026 I understand wholeheartedly wanting to protect your kids from the world, but there is a line. And not feeding them proper food crosses that!", "Yeah, key words there being \"the mum.\" Obviously she's not winning mum of the year but it's not OP's job to take it on herself to introduce allergens to a kid that isn't hers.", "NTA.\n\nThere is a 0% chance this child was going to be able to get through life without this issue presenting itself. All the mother\u2019s irrational behavior is doing was make it more dangerous and draw it out. You weren\u2019t intentionally trying to undermine the mother surreptitiously, you were just being normal and giving him normal food. \n\nFor the one millionth time in this thread, at the mother: \u201cI have anxiety\u201d is not a magic incantation to justify any kind of absurd or harmful behavior. Her behavior is HARMFUL to the son.", "NTA introducing kids to peanuts early reduces the risk of peanut allergies. It's not like she told you he had a peanut allergy.", "NTA. You couldn't have known. It would be different if she told you, obviously. She's an awful parent for not telling you that her kid has an allergy, assuming she knew.", "So sad that this 3 year old is already on a fast food/convenience food diet and not developing his palate. However, it is not your child and you should have at least asked her before feeding him something that held a risk of an allergic reaction because his reaction had been stronger he could have died. For me YTA.", "NTA no one is here cause you didn't know also the mother didn't and other comments proves why people don't like to watch kids under 8", "ESH. The mom for not exposing her child to allergens before this. You for not having the sense to ask before feeding him one of the most common allergens in the entire world.", "Literally came here to say this.", "*Robin Arryn", "You let the parents handle that.", "So?", "Celiac is pretty bad, so no baked goods?

No such rules in Germany. I just looked it up: Only 0.2% of the population in Europe is allergic to peanuts in any way. If 10% of that are so severe that it\u2019s life threatening that\u2019s 0.02%.\n\nSeems a bit drastic to implement blanket bans for that to me.", "NTA.
