The kid is probably allergic to peanuts because she refused to feed him a variety of foods. The earlier you introduce them to potential allergens, the less likely they are to become allergic to them. Also, he\u2019s going to have a lot of problems with being picky and being phobic of new foods if she keeps refusing to feed him properly.

It's not our choice to make. \n\nFurthermore, feeding a kid who you know has limited exposure to allergens a very common and sometimes life threatening allergen without parental permission is seriously dangerous. The kid could have died.\n\nAnd lastly whether you have successfully raised children or not is not particularly pertinent. It is at most a small indicator of whether or not she should even hear out your advice. Not an indication she should defer to you. Every child and every child/parent relationship is different and if it's not your child then you in fact do not know best just by virtue of having also had children.
