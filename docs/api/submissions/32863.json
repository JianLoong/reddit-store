Keep her so busy with stuff she doesn't have time to visit her mom. Let her experience a few visitations where the mom do4show up. Which will happen.  You need to have a heart to heart with the kid about the environment her mother would put her in. Talk to her ask her to reflect on how she was before her mom came around and now. Ask her how does she feel about herself now versus before.  Ask her to imagine herself in 5 years. 10 and how she's going to do that.

She had secure attachment to you and is emotionally not in a position to understand that her biological mother is not capable of meeting her needs.

Lai does not know herself and will struggle to find a way to function out of jail. Ash MUST NOT be exposed to this.\n\nOP has worked very hard for years to get herself in a position where she does meet Ash's needs. She IS Ash's mother at this point in every way except biology.

Sometimes we need to make hard choices for our kids and this is one of those moments. Choices our children might really not agree with. They however don't see the risks. They don't observe the chances and oportunities lost. They require guidenace. Hell I still need guidance. \n\nBio mums assertion that she is just going to take this child out of her environment, school, surroundings and move her in with a new BF shows me she is unfit to be a parent. No decent parent would make such a selfish and chaotic change to their child life independent of whether in a bratty 13 year old moment they wanted it.

Proving to the courts that she is a fit parent won't happen overnight, and I'm willing to bet she will either lose interest or screw herself over along the way. Ash might have to see the truth about her mother the hard way and when she comes back to you because her mother can't get her shit together than you will still be there when she needs it. It's possible that the more you fight this, the more you will push Ash away, because she won't see the truth if you don't give Laila the chance to fail. \n\nThe thing that would be the most worrisome for me would be watching Ash derail her future in the meantime, given the recent change in her behavior since Laila has been back in the picture.

She will need you, once she realizes her mother can't even take care of herself let alone a teenager.

You don't necessarily have to report violations, but you could let her know that if she takes any more actions that undermine Ash's education, safety, or stability then reporting violations will become necessary for Ash's sake.

As much as that idea sucks it might be the best solution, this woman is a danger to her daughter's life and well being and is an extremely negative influence on her. Tell them it is making things difficult for you. I'm pretty sure legally she can't make the decision to live with her mom considering her age and since they gave you custody. It sucks her mom is back to who she was before when she went to prison. However, 13 is not an age where you can make serious decisions by yourself, she's still a kid and her mom has made it so she would rather have a sad and pathetic life with her than a thriving and loving one with you.

So here is my advice to a heroic woman who from the age of 19 has done nothing but build a good life to take care of others.\n\n1.) You keep Ash.\n\n2.) You and Ash go to therapy together.  (Be sure you don't go to a \"reuinfication at any cost, who cares if the children's lives are destroyed\" social worker for this therapy.) What has happened with Lai's terrible behavior and influence has to be confusing and upsetting for Ash.  Perhaps therapy will help.  Ash might also need individual therapy.  She's been though a lot with Lai in and out of her life, and Lai's behavior when she's there.\n\n3.) Go for monitored visitation only for Lai.  Without a monitor, God only knows what will happen when Ash is with her, what Lai will say about you, and what she'll do in front of her.\n\n4.) Get a good lawyer to make sure your custodial arrangement is what you believe is best for Ash.\n\n5.) Back away from helping out Lai.  Do not let her live in your house again.  Do not allow her unlimited access to your house.  Do not allow her access to Ash beyond the custodial agreement.  Change the locks.  \n\n6.) Trust your judgement, but know that you can't fix Lai.  And for Ash's sake, you need to disentangle yourself from caring for Lai, who sounds like an extremely irresponsible, out-of-control person with poor judgment.  \n\nYou are very much NTA.  I admire you.  Bravo!", "Your best bet might be to compromise by letting Ash stay with Laila for a period of time. (a month or two?) Keep close contact with Ash and let her know that you love her and want the best for her.

At worst, Ash learns some hard lessons from Laila and the boyfriend. Being the safe harbor is the best thing for Ash in the long run and puts Ash in the position of making the choice for herself.  \n\n\nYou should remove all financial support from Laila. Once she realizes that she's going to have to support this kid by herself, she may very well decide that it's too much work.", "You an asshole for letting your sister move in with you, knowing the type of person she is, but you\u2019re NTA for saying no.

You should move forward assuming she is suffering from some type of trauma. \n\nBeing separated from Laila was likely a traumatic event for her and it happening again will be as well. From the moment babies are born they can suffer from Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and that trauma rewires their brains. Separation from her bio parent(s) is one potential ACE.
