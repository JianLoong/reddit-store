Laila got pregnant at 17 and went to prison at 18 for robbery with her boyfriend. Because I was 19 I was legally allowed to take custody of my niece Ash. The whole time my sister was in prison I would visit her and let my niece go as well, so she could try to build a connection with her mom. But as the years went by Ash started calling me mom and called my sister Lai. Because I was the one that was there day to day taking care of her. Fast forward to 2020 and Laila gets out of prison early due to good behavior and the state trying to reduce the prison population due to Covid 19. Laila is 27 at this time and Ash is 10. By now I have gone to school, gotten a a stable job, bought a house and feel I am doing well for myself and Ash. So of course Laila is paroled to come live with me. At first everything is good. We all start getting acquainted and use to each other. Lai is trying to figure out life as an adult in the free world and of course I am trying to help her as well. After about a year Lai has really started influencing Ash in a negative way. Prior to her coming home Ash was a straight A student. Very well mannered. In school dance and cheer. And making strides towards a positive entry to middle school. Now my sweetie is rude, flunking most of her classes. Cursing and talking back to me. And Lai just laughs it off. I feel like I\u2019m raising 2 teenagers at that point. Lai stayed gone a lot. Trying to invite strange and crazy people over to my home etc. I had enough. She wouldn\u2019t work. Wouldn\u2019t help around the house nothing. Now 2023 Lai finally has a job at Burger King and has a crazy weird boyfriend. A few weeks ago she says she\u2019s moving in with her boyfriend. I told her ok good luck. Then she says she\u2019s taking Ash with her. Oh HELL NO. I\u2019m her parent. I will gladly allow visitation. But you are not taking this child out of my home to go couch surfing with you and your stupid boyfriend. Mind you Lai is still on parole until 2026. Ash walked in on us arguing and says she wants to go with her mom. I explained to her that I have custody and that she cannot go with her. She cried and stomped out the room. My sister then yells at me and says I\u2019m a horrible person for splitting up her and her child. Fist of all I have given up my entire young adult years to raise this child. I gave up a world travel fellowship, a relationship etc just to be here for this child so she would never have to go through what my sister and I did in the foster care system. I am all for letting them visit each other. But I\u2019m not letting her leave. Ash is now 13 and feels she\u2019s is entitled to make her own decisions. But I know how her mom is. It\u2019ll be a disappointment going to live with her. I\u2019ve given her such a stable life and my sister has ruined most it in less than 3 years.

And soon she will loose interest anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hardest part will be: \"*Ash is now 13 and feels she\u2019s is entitled to make her own decisions*.\" At 13, a kid is entitled to be heard. But decisions are still up to the parents. That means you.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of being a parent is, sometimes you can't give your children what they WANT, instead you have to give them what they NEED. And they don't know the difference yet. But parenthood is a marathon, not a sprint. In time, she will see.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave the kid a stable household and now hold parental rights.  Once she turns 18, you can tell Ash she can do what she wants.  She can visit her bio mom as much as she wants, but you need to continue to raise her yourself.", "NTA because you are just trying to do what is best for this child and you are trying to make sure that Ash becomes a productive member of society unlike her mother (no offense to your sister). You are not the Asshole and you legally have custody of her AND Laila is still on parole until 2026 so she still has time to get her mindset and life together so I would start considering when it gets closer to the end of her parole.", "NTA, but if I were you, I\u2019d cut your sister out entirely, even with just visitation she\u2019ll be whispering bullshit into that kiddo\u2019s ear.", "NTA - Your only mistake was letting Laila stay in your house as soon as you noticed ash was going down the wrong path. I get it - family. Hopefully, Ash will realize her mother is a terrible influence. Good luck, OP.", "NTA! You're doing the best thing you can for this little girl! Not to mention the fact that she's still in your custody and if you let her go with her mom and anything happened it would be on you. Frankly I wouldn't even want to let her have visitation but of course that would probably cause more trouble than it would avoid. But I would definitely not let her have visitation outside of your supervision!", "NTA. Letting your sister move in was a huge mistake. Ash needs counseling stat.", "NTA,  but Your mistake was not setting hard boundaries with your sister. She should have been told that she had to get a job and heep it and pay her share of the costs - food, electricity. And buy her own clothes and suck. Or she got kicked out. Instead, she got to show Ash that you could be a bum and live off others with few consequences.\n\nDo not ever let your sister move back in. Let Ash see what her mom leading that life leads to - perhaps Ash can be gotten back on track.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might wish, however, to contact the court and report your concerns about the child's behavior since her mother was released and came to call. Your sister's Parole Officer should also be made aware of her decision to relocate, immediately. Discuss your rights as custodial caregiver with the child advocate who dealt with your case and find out what the legal process might be if the child runs away from your home to be with her mother."]}
