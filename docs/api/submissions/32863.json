The whole time my sister was in prison I would visit her and let my niece go as well, so she could try to build a connection with her mom. But as the years went by Ash started calling me mom and called my sister Lai. Because I was the one that was there day to day taking care of her. Fast forward to 2020 and Laila gets out of prison early due to good behavior and the state trying to reduce the prison population due to Covid 19. Laila is 27 at this time and Ash is 10. By now I have gone to school, gotten a a stable job, bought a house and feel I am doing well for myself and Ash. So of course Laila is paroled to come live with me. At first everything is good. We all start getting acquainted and use to each other. Lai is trying to figure out life as an adult in the free world and of course I am trying to help her as well. After about a year Lai has really started influencing Ash in a negative way. Prior to her coming home Ash was a straight A student. Very well mannered. In school dance and cheer. And making strides towards a positive entry to middle school. Now my sweetie is rude, flunking most of her classes. Cursing and talking back to me. And Lai just laughs it off. I feel like I\u2019m raising 2 teenagers at that point. Lai stayed gone a lot. Trying to invite strange and crazy people over to my home etc. I had enough. She wouldn\u2019t work. Wouldn\u2019t help around the house nothing. Now 2023 Lai finally has a job at Burger King and has a crazy weird boyfriend. A few weeks ago she says she\u2019s moving in with her boyfriend. I told her ok good luck. Then she says she\u2019s taking Ash with her. Oh HELL NO. I\u2019m her parent. I will gladly allow visitation. But you are not taking this child out of my home to go couch surfing with you and your stupid boyfriend. Mind you Lai is still on parole until 2026. Ash walked in on us arguing and says she wants to go with her mom. I explained to her that I have custody and that she cannot go with her. She cried and stomped out the room. My sister then yells at me and says I\u2019m a horrible person for splitting up her and her child. Fist of all I have given up my entire young adult years to raise this child. I gave up a world travel fellowship, a relationship etc just to be here for this child so she would never have to go through what my sister and I did in the foster care system. I am all for letting them visit each other. But I\u2019m not letting her leave. Ash is now 13 and feels she\u2019s is entitled to make her own decisions. But I know how her mom is. It\u2019ll be a disappointment going to live with her. I\u2019ve given her such a stable life and my sister has ruined most it in less than 3 years.

You might wish, however, to contact the court and report your concerns about the child's behavior since her mother was released and came to call. Your sister's Parole Officer should also be made aware of her decision to relocate, immediately. Discuss your rights as custodial caregiver with the child advocate who dealt with your case and find out what the legal process might be if the child runs away from your home to be with her mother.", "NTA. But your niece needs therapy, I am sure having her mother live with her has stirred up a lot of complex emotions.", "NTA. You've been her mom for 13 years. You have her best interests at heart. At 13, she does not have the capacity to see how the trajectory of her entire life can be destroyed by following your sister. You are her legal guardian and her parent. My advice would be to get her in with a therapist who can help her work out her feelings, because it sounds like your sister managed to do quite a bit of damage in the time she lived with you. The rebellious phase tends to get worse in the teenage years before it gets better. Hang in there, OP.", "You need to fix your relationship with your child ASAP. This can turn into a very bad nightmare if you let this continue", "NTA. I would honestly let the girl stay with her mother for a trial period. She kinda needs a lesson. She would be coming home crying in no time. But then, I am not emotionally invested in her like you are. There is a risk, though, that she will hold it against you that you separated her from her mother instead of appreciating what you gave her.", "In the future when she grows up I know ash will be grateful for everything you've done, don't let her go, you are her mum now and it sounds like you have done an amazing job at it too.

Unfortunately, you don't win here. Either Ash blames you or Laila blames you.", "Definitely NTA, YOU need to be mama bear. Your sister is toxic. You need to set clearer boundaries.  Sister should never be allowed to come live with you again, ever! She also should not be allowed visit her daughter but you might have court ordered visitation.  Get the kid back in activities.  Keep her so busy with stuff she doesn't have time to visit her mom. Let her experience a few visitations where the mom do4show up. Which will happen.  You need to have a heart to heart with the kid about the environment her mother would put her in. Talk to her ask her to reflect on how she was before her mom came around and now. Ask her how does she feel about herself now versus before.  Ask her to imagine herself in 5 years. 10 and how she's going to do that. Sometimes kids need to see the big picture then the little picture to understand.

I wanted to read, but a screen full of writing is difficult for some of us to read.", "**NTA**\n\nBut you will be if you don't get hold of this situation for Ash's benefit. She had secure attachment to you and is emotionally not in a position to understand that her biological mother is not capable of meeting her needs. Incarceration is not what was stopping her but a symptom of her being unfit to be the person Ash needs. This will not have changed behind bars. Lai does not know herself and will struggle to find a way to function out of jail. Ash MUST NOT be exposed to this.\n\nOP has worked very hard for years to get herself in a position where she does meet Ash's needs. She IS Ash's mother at this point in every way except biology. She needs to manage to secure the attachment Ash has to her again. With stability, routine and therapy Ash will get back to where and who she was. Sometimes we need to make hard choices for our kids and this is one of those moments. Choices our children might really not agree with. They however don't see the risks. They don't observe the chances and oportunities lost. They require guidenace. Hell I still need guidance. \n\nBio mums assertion that she is just going to take this child out of her environment, school, surroundings and move her in with a new BF shows me she is unfit to be a parent. No decent parent would make such a selfish and chaotic change to their child life independent of whether in a bratty 13 year old moment they wanted it. The only thing I can criticise op for is for allowing Lai to live with them in the first place. It was never going to be in Ash's best interests.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to cut some cords. Get your locks changed so your sister can\u2019t return to your place. Speak to your sisters parole officer and make sure they know sister isn\u2019t staying with you. Cut all visitation unless it\u2019s supervised by you personally. I could easily imagine your sister taking the daughter and not returning with her.\n\nGiven your sister\u2019s track record, I would not allow the child to visit at the boyfriend\u2019s place, as I doubt it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s a pretty good bet that your sister will violate your parole. Not if, but when, and probably soon. \n\nGet your child into therapy and start working on mending the damage your sister has accomplished. I know you want to help your sister, but she isn\u2019t good for your child, and you have a higher duty to your child.", "I would plan a weekend away with Ash so you can speak to her without your sister influencing.  Lay everything out, including examples of how well Ash was doing without her bio mom. Talk to her honestly about why you are legally responsible. I also think Ash needs therapy.", "YTA for allowing your sister to poison your daughter for three years. You watched it happen and did nothing. At this point the daughter may be far too gone. She has imprinted on your sister, mimicked her behavior and given up on everything that was once important to her. \n\nMy guess is your daughter will eventually get her way, move out and fall into the same mistakes your sister did.  Only then will your daughter come crawling back once she has ruined her life. \n\nGood luck, but you take part of the blame in this.", "NTA.", "You are the hero of this story, NTA.", "NTA, but unfortunately, as much as you want to protect Ash, you might have to let your sister crash and burn. Tell her to go ahead and start the custody process. Proving to the courts that she is a fit parent won't happen overnight, and I'm willing to bet she will either lose interest or screw herself over along the way. Ash might have to see the truth about her mother the hard way and when she comes back to you because her mother can't get her shit together than you will still be there when she needs it. It's possible that the more you fight this, the more you will push Ash away, because she won't see the truth if you don't give Laila the chance to fail. \n\nThe thing that would be the most worrisome for me would be watching Ash derail her future in the meantime, given the recent change in her behavior since Laila has been back in the picture. But if she wants to act out she's going to act out, all you can do is try your best to make sure you're there when she needs you. She will need you, once she realizes her mother can't even take care of herself let alone a teenager. Don't let the drama with your sister mess with your head, you said yourself that Ash was doing great before Laila came back in the picture so all you can do is focus on what is best for her and hopefully the trash will see itself out.", "OP you\u2019re NTA at all.\n\nHave you ever heard the saying \u201cthose who don\u2019t hear, will feel\u201d ?\n\nI\u2019m not a parent so idk if this would be borderline abuse, but maybe give your daughter/niece a dose of that saying and let her go live with her mother.  From the description you gave of your sister, I don\u2019t think it would be long before your niece came back to you saying she made a mistake, and asking to live with you again.\n\nThis can also backfire in spectacular fashion lol. I\u2019m just a huge advocate of letting people learn from their own mistakes.", "NTA Hopefully Ash matures and forgives you when she is grown. In the meantime I am sorry that she is giving you attitude and cannot see how fortunate she has been.", "First of all, kudos to you for stepping up and providing a stable, loving environment for your niece. It's evident that you've made incredible sacrifices and have shown immense dedication and love. It's tough navigating these waters, especially when it involves family. Remember, your niece\u2019s wellbeing is paramount, and it sounds like you\u2019ve been doing an excellent job at prioritizing that. As someone who has been in a similar situation, I can relate to the challenges and emotional toll it can take. But, seeing your niece grow up in a nurturing environment is a reward in itself. You\u2019re not just her guardian; you\u2019ve become a pivotal figure in her life, shaping her future for the better. Hold onto that, and remember, you\u2019re doing an amazing job.

Obviously, the mother doesn't make good decisions. She goes to prison with an infant at home, and immediately after release, she's not trying to better her life for her and her child. Instead, she's a lazy sloff. Moms sacrifice, like OP, has done.", "Learn to read:\n\n>Because I was 19 I was legally allowed to take custody of my niece Ash\n\nYou:\n\n>It's not your place to unilaterally make this decision.

And part of parenting is helping kids to navigate big and confusing feelings. It also gives parents an opportunity to explain their decisions, rather than authoritarian arguments like \"my house my rules\". So for example it could look like Ash explaining how she feels about the situation and her mom and OP saying \"yeah I can tell that you're feeling ____ and it totally makes sense. And I bet after missing all that time with your mom you want to be together. But my job is to take care of you, and that situation isn't safe or healthy for you and that is my priority over anything else because it's my job. Since you feel ______ would _________ help to soothe that?\"", "I really appreciate this sensible and empathetic response. So often adults refuse to consider children\u2019s perspectives. Creating space for them to be heard and understood is so important, even if the outcome isn\u2019t what the child wants."]}
