We agreed on watching Star Wars 4-6 because they're the best ones and we all like them. \n\nI'm also in the early stages of dating with a guy Max and he was texting me during the film. I wasn't constantly on my phone and would reply every 10 minutes or so. I also put my brightness down to the lowest so the screen wouldn't disturb the movie and I sat on the large sofa on the outside to be mindful. My text alerts went through to my watch so there would be no alert sounds. \n\nNear the end of the first movie, Katie asked me to put my phone away. I explained and she said that was fine so I kept texting. Later in the second movie, she asked me again so I apologised and did put my phone away. \n\nToday, Katie messaged me about it and said it was very disrespectful and she felt it was detracting from what the night was about. I apologised but also disagreed with her and we left it there. Was I an asshole for that?

An occasional text here and there is fine but I wouldn\u2019t say every 10 minutes is occasional. Is it really that hard to not touch your phone for a significant period of time and then text max saying \u201csorry I am/was having a movie night with friends\u201d", "> I wasn't constantly on my phone and would reply every 10 minutes or so.\n\nThat's pretty constant. \n\nYTA - learn how to be present with your friends despite being in a relationship. Really fucking rude behavior", "YTA. If you were pulling your phone out every 10 minutes throughout the entirety of all three movies that\u2019s nearly 40 times that you had your phone out shedding light into the room, regardless of if you had the brightness down or not it\u2019s still distracting in a dark room. Plus my understanding of notifications coming through on watches is that the watch also lights up so that was probably also annoying for your friends. Then to top it off you didn\u2019t put your phone away when your friend nicely asked you the first time. Regardless of if we were watching a movie or not I\u2019d be super annoyed and frustrated if my friend was on their phone every 10 minutes while we were hanging out. That tells me they\u2019d rather be somewhere else than hanging out with me if they can\u2019t get their face out of their phone for more than 10 minutes.", "I'm gonna say YTA because she asked you a few times and just wanted quality time with your friend group", "Yes. YTA once every movie is fine enough, or on bathroom breaks, but every ten minutes is a bit much. He knows your at a friend's house watching movies, so there's no need to do that while out with friends.", "YTA. Better to have left the room and missed the movie.", "YTA, but how exactly were you all going to both watch 3 movies in a row and also catch-up?\n\nYou \"weren't there\" because you were on your phone the whole time.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re prioritising \u201cthe early stages of dating\u201d with some guy who may not even be relationship material at a time when you\u2019re supposed to be catching up with friends you haven\u2019t seen in ages and you\u2019re wondering if you were a rude AH to your friends ?", "YTA\n\nSimilar to movie theaters, it's impolite to be on a bright phone while watching a movie.", "YTA.\n\nYou were doing something with your friends but your constantly being on your phone with Max told your friends that they were not a priority.  Text once or twice, okay, but it sounds as if it was A LOT.  Be present and be with your friends or go be with Max but ignoring your friends for your phone when you are with them is just downright RUDE.", "YTA.  Can't hang with your friends without constantly texting whatever new man you've glommed on to?", "INFO:\n\nWhat was the lighting like - in the room?\n\nFor example, if the lights were on, and the room wasn't dark... I'd say you aren't TA.  OTOH, if the room was dark - and it was catching the corner of your friends eye over and over, I completely understand where they are coming from.", "YTA for two reasons.  \n\nEven on the darkest level, your phone has some light. The fact that somebody asked you to put it away the first time proves that it was distracting. Otherwise, they would not have noticed you were on it. \n\nYou said you all got together to catch up with each other. Then, you ignored them to text with your new boyfriend. Not once or twice, but over and over and over and over...  Showing that you thought you had better things to do than be with them. Very disrespectful in two different ways at the same time.", "You don\u2019t think every ten minutes all night long is constant?  It is. \n\nBehavior is communication. You communicated that you were more interested in some new guy than spending time with your friends. Why did you bother to go?\n\nYTA", "YTA just go somewhere else and indulge your phone addiction.", "YTA. Quit trying to justify your behavior. You asked if YTA and everyone is saying yes, YTA.

I'd assume it wasn't total silence for 6 hours of movies I'd hope.", "TA.

Don\u2019t do that again please.", "YTA you mentally left the hang out and the friends you were meant to catch up with.\n\nTalking with the people In the room with you would have been okay as long as everyone watching agreed, because generally speaking during movies is an AH move.", "Wtf? You're out hanging with friends not going to Sunday breakfast after church with the family. NTA. Why does she feel the need to dictate what other people are doing?", "YTA. No phones in the theater. No ringing, talking, and definitely no lighted screens. That's basic movie etiquette. There's usually a big notice before the movie to not use your phones. Watch the movie or play phone footsie with your new boy. Not both. It would have been marginally better had you left the theater to text, though not by much. Enjoy the movie. Phones on silent or only respond to emergencies.", "YTA, if I was hanging out with friends and one of them was constantly pulling out their phone (yes I'd call every 10 minutes constantly) I would assume that they did not want to be there.

So insecure you can't type that your busy and text later.", "NTA you\u2019re not in a movie theatre and you\u2019ve all seen the movies before. You did everything you could to not bother them as they watched (which is far more than most people would have)", "NTA. You probably should have stayed off the phone, but this extremely minor indiscretion doesn\u2019t rise to the level of being an AH.

The constant being on your phone is very disrespectful to the people you were with.", "NTA - It's a movie night. Half the time people talk through these nights and can't imagine people were sitting in silence. Maybe in future though the person your dating can understand you're out with your pals. \n\nEdit: Apologies I initially read it wrong and assumed it was a cinema.", "Eh very light YTA. I don't think texting or being on your phone while watching a movie with friends at home is the same thing as doing it at the movies but it does sound like you were a bit absentee while hanging out with your friends. Your friend's comments seem a bit out of line - but do you think they're really upset about the phone screen being out or the fact that your attention was elsewhere?", "NTA. People are hardly ever put their phones away. I\u2019ve seen people checking their social media on first dates. \n\nYou were as respectful about it as possible given the circumstances. You also were not in a movie theater distracting people. You weren\u2019t at a funeral. You were hanging out with good friends watching movies you\u2019ve all already seen before. \n\nYour friend seems like a controlling drama queen.

That\u2019s the real world baby, take it or leave it!", "YTA for several reasons - every 10 mins or so is fairly consistent and even if the light does not brighten the room it\u2019s noticeable and breaks from being immersed in the film.\n- Your friend asked you to stop and you carried on\n- It\u2019s Star Wars have a little respect haha\nAlso your new BF is a little off here, can\u2019t leave you when they know you are watching a film\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if you weee hanging out earlier it\u2019s not like you get a pass for being rude because you were not rude earlier lol", "NTA\n\nthe people saying you're an asshole sure do seem to expect an awful lot of undivided attentiuon from their friends. if you're hanging out and watching a movie (let alone three movies, oh my god), it's really not that big of a deal to not be staring straight ahead at the movie? i like all of the star wars movies too, but i wouldn't have a ton of fun watching 4-6 straight, in the same room with others, not talking, sitting there like robots.", "NTA. If I was getting together with old friends I hadn\u2019t seen in awhile and we\u2019d agreed to watch a movie we\u2019ve seen a dozen times before, the movie would be more of a fun background noise thing but I\u2019d also want to chit chat and laugh and whatnot.

You're being obnoxious to someone spending time with you, as well as the other people who dont want to see your stupid screen light up.

Period.  No matter what you're doing or where you are - someone's living room, taking a walk in the park, in a theater, at a restaurant, etc.  This is what Katie was talking about - not the brightness of your phone, that you were on the phone at all distracted from what the group was doing.\n\n**You be present for the people you are with.**  If you want to hang out and chat with whoever is on the phone, then go hang out and chat with them instead of, not during, hanging out with your friends.  Constantly being on your phone in the presence of others (where the entire point is being with those people)  tells them that you don't actually care about them and would rather be doing something else with someone else.\n\nThere's zero reason for your phone to be out while you're actively hanging out with people to enjoy their company and the group activity unless perhaps you're a parent making sure the babysitter isn't calling with an emergency.  You either should have told him beforehand you wouldn't be available that night or after the first text responded that you're busy with friends and would talk to him tomorrow.", "The amount of chronically online people on here accusing you of being addicted to your phone would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. While it's a little inconsiderate to be texting during a movie, it doesn't seem like it's exactly a first time experience for anyone there. So unless you texting was somehow stopping this person from paying attention then it just sounds like they're butthurt about not having your full attention, which nobody on this planet is entitled to.", "YTA - It bothers me when my friends want to hang out (even if it's watching a movie) and then text throughout it. It gives the impression that the phone is more important than they are, regardless of how much catching up you did before the movies.\n\nThere's an interesting video that talks about how having your cell phone out makes people feel. I recommend watching the entire video, but I'll start you off at the important part: [https://youtu.be/R0xYCy2eft8?t=185](https://youtu.be/R0xYCy2eft8?t=185)\n\nThere is a psychological effect (whether we mean to or not) wherein people feel less important when your phone is out.

You were not in the theatre, we\u2019re not being loud, and your screen brightness was down. Not to mention it\u2019s 3 movies! Also you stated everyone has already seen the movie so it\u2019s not like your missing things and asking questions because you missed something.

I guess I was wrong", "Ah yes, I see that's how it can look. Just within our group though or if we go do things separately there have been times where my friends have been on their phone like that, even Katie so I didn't really think it would come across like thay", "Yeah but like in a theatre, we were in a living room", "lol not at home! Doesn't sound like they were at the theater", "Yeah dude some people still actually watch movies like a normal person. Friends aren't responsible for OP's addiction. And Katie asked her stop and she didn't.

Your friends wanted you to watch the movie with them. Put down your phone ffs", "It doesn't matter if it was constant or not. You should have told Max ahead of time that you would be at the theater with friends and not available to text. Then you should have turned your phone OFF.

I did when she asked me again the second time because she sounded off", "It only annoyed Katie, I apologised in the chat and had my own chat with Rachel about it and she wasn't annoyed at all\n\nI thought I did read the room? I guess I didn't", "Yes, I did follow it up with a friend who was also there and apologised in the group chat just in case and people were replying like they didn't even notice me doing that and it was okay", "Why are you arguing with everyone? Did you come here for a judgment, or only a judgment in your favor?", "Maybe you did and Kate was just more sensitive. It\u2019s hard to know not having actually been there lol.\n\nBut in general it\u2019s considered rude. \n\nIt\u2019s all about the people you are with though. And if it was discussed before hand I would personally have been fine with it.", "I can see that. It's not unusual for at least one of us to be on a phone during an outing so I didn't think it was a enough of a big deal. That's how I read the room anyways"]}
