I explained and she said that was fine so I kept texting. Later in the second movie, she asked me again so I apologised and did put my phone away. \n\nToday, Katie messaged me about it and said it was very disrespectful and she felt it was detracting from what the night was about.

An occasional text here and there is fine but I wouldn\u2019t say every 10 minutes is occasional. Is it really that hard to not touch your phone for a significant period of time and then text max saying \u201csorry I am/was having a movie night with friends\u201d", "> I wasn't constantly on my phone and would reply every 10 minutes or so.\n\nThat's pretty constant. \n\nYTA - learn how to be present with your friends despite being in a relationship. Really fucking rude behavior", "YTA. If you were pulling your phone out every 10 minutes throughout the entirety of all three movies that\u2019s nearly 40 times that you had your phone out shedding light into the room, regardless of if you had the brightness down or not it\u2019s still distracting in a dark room. Plus my understanding of notifications coming through on watches is that the watch also lights up so that was probably also annoying for your friends. Then to top it off you didn\u2019t put your phone away when your friend nicely asked you the first time. Regardless of if we were watching a movie or not I\u2019d be super annoyed and frustrated if my friend was on their phone every 10 minutes while we were hanging out. That tells me they\u2019d rather be somewhere else than hanging out with me if they can\u2019t get their face out of their phone for more than 10 minutes.", "I'm gonna say YTA because she asked you a few times and just wanted quality time with your friend group", "Yes. YTA once every movie is fine enough, or on bathroom breaks, but every ten minutes is a bit much. He knows your at a friend's house watching movies, so there's no need to do that while out with friends.", "YTA. Better to have left the room and missed the movie.", "YTA, but how exactly were you all going to both watch 3 movies in a row and also catch-up?\n\nYou \"weren't there\" because you were on your phone the whole time.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re prioritising \u201cthe early stages of dating\u201d with some guy who may not even be relationship material at a time when you\u2019re supposed to be catching up with friends you haven\u2019t seen in ages and you\u2019re wondering if you were a rude AH to your friends ?", "YTA\n\nSimilar to movie theaters, it's impolite to be on a bright phone while watching a movie.", "YTA.\n\nYou were doing something with your friends but your constantly being on your phone with Max told your friends that they were not a priority.

The fact that somebody asked you to put it away the first time proves that it was distracting.

Don\u2019t do that again please.", "YTA you mentally left the hang out and the friends you were meant to catch up with.\n\nTalking with the people In the room with you would have been okay as long as everyone watching agreed, because generally speaking during movies is an AH move.", "Wtf? You're out hanging with friends not going to Sunday breakfast after church with the family. NTA. Why does she feel the need to dictate what other people are doing?", "YTA. No phones in the theater. No ringing, talking, and definitely no lighted screens. That's basic movie etiquette. There's usually a big notice before the movie to not use your phones. Watch the movie or play phone footsie with your new boy. Not both. It would have been marginally better had you left the theater to text, though not by much. Enjoy the movie. Phones on silent or only respond to emergencies.", "YTA, if I was hanging out with friends and one of them was constantly pulling out their phone (yes I'd call every 10 minutes constantly) I would assume that they did not want to be there.

I don't think texting or being on your phone while watching a movie with friends at home is the same thing as doing it at the movies but it does sound like you were a bit absentee while hanging out with your friends.

People are hardly ever put their phones away. I\u2019ve seen people checking their social media on first dates. \n\nYou were as respectful about it as possible given the circumstances. You also were not in a movie theater distracting people. You weren\u2019t at a funeral.

Period.  No matter what you're doing or where you are - someone's living room, taking a walk in the park, in a theater, at a restaurant, etc.  This is what Katie was talking about - not the brightness of your phone, that you were on the phone at all distracted from what the group was doing.\n\n**You be present for the people you are with.**  If you want to hang out and chat with whoever is on the phone, then go hang out and chat with them instead of, not during, hanging out with your friends.  Constantly being on your phone in the presence of others (where the entire point is being with those people)  tells them that you don't actually care about them and would rather be doing something else with someone else.\n\nThere's zero reason for your phone to be out while you're actively hanging out with people to enjoy their company and the group activity unless perhaps you're a parent making sure the babysitter isn't calling with an emergency.  You either should have told him beforehand you wouldn't be available that night or after the first text responded that you're busy with friends and would talk to him tomorrow.", "The amount of chronically online people on here accusing you of being addicted to your phone would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. While it's a little inconsiderate to be texting during a movie, it doesn't seem like it's exactly a first time experience for anyone there.

It gives the impression that the phone is more important than they are, regardless of how much catching up you did before the movies.\n\nThere's an interesting video that talks about how having your cell phone out makes people feel.

Personally I wouldn\u2019t say anything to a friend if they did that, but that wouldn\u2019t mean I hadn\u2019t noticed or wasn\u2019t aware of their disrespect.", "Yeah I'm with you on this one!", "I assumed you were implying I wasn't present with my friends at all, my mistake if you weren't", "Yeah I explained I was talking to Max and she knows how well things are going between us so she was like awh that's cute, that's okay. If she'd said something that indicated she didn't like me being on it, I would have put it away the first time", "No she sounded okay. Really if there was any kind of issue in the way she said it I would have stopped. I did when she asked me again the second time because she sounded off", "It only annoyed Katie, I apologised in the chat and had my own chat with Rachel about it and she wasn't annoyed at all\n\nI thought I did read the room? I guess I didn't", "Yes, I did follow it up with a friend who was also there and apologised in the group chat just in case and people were replying like they didn't even notice me doing that and it was okay", "Why are you arguing with everyone? Did you come here for a judgment, or only a judgment in your favor?", "Maybe you did and Kate was just more sensitive. It\u2019s hard to know not having actually been there lol.\n\nBut in general it\u2019s considered rude. \n\nIt\u2019s all about the people you are with though. And if it was discussed before hand I would personally have been fine with it.", "I can see that. It's not unusual for at least one of us to be on a phone during an outing so I didn't think it was a enough of a big deal. That's how I read the room anyways", "YTA. You were disrespectful to the group. If you can\u2019t go a couple of hours without replying, you shouldn\u2019t attend a movie night or any other group event.", "YTA  you were rude. If you aren\u2019t interested in being present with them why would they invite you out? You could text at your house.", "NTA \n\nPeople saying your TAH is crazy to me, drinks + hangout AND 3 movies is A LOT. I don\u2019t even understand how you could bother anybody that much by pulling your phone out to send a quick text every once in a while. If you were all talking it would be rude but you obviously weren\u2019t doing any catching up at this point if you were all watching movies in silence. \n\nThis is obviously an unpopular opinion but planning a group hangout to catch up with friends and then everybody sitting in silence for 6+ hours watching movies you\u2019ve already seen is so odd to me. When my friends and I do movies nights we always end up talking too much to even watch the movie. I\u2019d be bored and on my phone too.", "NTA no one is talking and just watching the film it\u2019s not bothering anyone. People need to chill", "NTA. It's a living room. You dimmed it. I'm sure you kept it quiet. Good grief. Your friend sounds uptight.", "NTA\nit\u2019s a movie marathon. Should be a casual thing and it\u2019s Star Wars?! Who cares? \n\nI LOVE Star Wars and I just can\u2019t see myself caring that much. You\u2019re excited about a new person? I\u2019m excited for you! Text them, just tell me what\u2019s going on lol", "Probably get down voted for this, but NTA. You can text and still be present during the movies. It's not like you all haven't seen them before, and it doesn't sound like you were ignoring anyone the whole time during. Everyone seems to be overreacting over nothing.", "I can't give a judgment, but I'll say that unless I'm in a movie theater I honestly cannot get through a movie without doing something with my hands (which, for me, is usually my phone or drawing). If I'm in a theater, I literally go through all the snacks because I don't have anything to do with my hands.  \n\n\n6-8 hours of silent movie time isn't really catching up. I would've peaced out before the movies started tbh.", "I do business on my phone, so it's important. But not the emergencies that other commenters seem to be demanding for you to have permission to touch your phone. Jesus Christ I've never seen so many comments about someone being offended over a phone. Who's to say you can't be present with friends and also have a conversation on your phone. I've never hung out with someone, much less a group of people, and been upset that they're having a conversation on their phone. A date, or having lunch with someone is different. A theater is different. Casually rewatching a long series with a group? Who gives a damn if you're on the phone. I think it's weird that the first person cared enough to call you out 3 separate times. NTA imo. Maybe try to be more present. However, I don't think phone usage and connection have a direct relationship.", "NTA. You caught up with your friends prior to the movies and took steps to avoid being disruptive with your phone.", "Look I assumed from the title that you meant while you were in a theater and was ready to launch a very hearty YTA, but you were watching over 6 hours of movies in a living room?! Hell no. NTA. Also why is this considered a \u201ccatch up \u201c activity? I love Star Wars but I\u2019ve seen them a million times I\u2019d be on my phone too.The amount of people saying YTA are absolutely mind blowing to me.", "NTA\n\nI realize being present and in the moment with your friends is important, but considering that ya'll are just chilling and watching a MOVIE that clearly all of you have seen before then it's fine. Maybe not as frequent as you did would have been better but still it's your decision to do what you want. It would have been different if you were playing a video game or watching a youtube video.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not like you were at the cinema or anything, honestly. If someone told me to put my phone away while I was texting my wife and being quiet and respectful, as you were with turning the brightness down, I simply wouldn't go to another movie night with them", "NTA\n\nIn a living room the phone doesn't disturb people like in a theater. It would be rude to spend time on your phone when hanging out with friends but only when people are socializing. Watching a movie doesn't involve communication so they shouldn't care which screen you are looking at. If there is a movie playing that I don't care for I will be on the phone most of the time. Why should I torture myself watching something I don't like.", "NTA everyone who says you are is kinda tapped. \n\nAll of my friends do this when we hang out\u2026 It\u2019s really not that big of a deal everyone is making it out to be. Especially if you aren\u2019t interested in the movie, which I don\u2019t know.\n\nExpecting people to not check their phone when you\u2019re with them is kinda crazy.", "NTA. You guys caught up at drinks and were watching a movie at someone\u2019s house. I can understand if everyone had a problem with it or it was being disruptive or taking you away from the meet up but, if we\u2019re chillin at someone\u2019s house, watching a movie and no one is talking to me directly then I\u2019m going to be on my phone if someone texts me. We\u2019re adults. We all have stuff going on. Was Katie at all interested in your new love interest or just mad you were texting them. Assuming she knew who you were texting and also assuming you mentioned him at some point during drinks.", "NTA I feel like it wasn\u2019t a moment where you were actively bonding and chatting, so you\u2019re all just all staring at a screen but you\u2019re just looking at a different one every now and again discreetly as to not distract anyone. \n\nYou\u2019re in a living room not a theatre and I feel you should be able to relax around your friends not have them police your living room behaviour.", "YTA. Put your stupid phone away for a couple hours. There's no excuse for interrupting ANY shared event for a text, unless somebody's dead or in the hospital.", "YTA It\u2019s annoying!!! It is bright no matter how low your setting is. It\u2019s rude.", "NTA, you weren\u2019t at the theater and it wasn\u2019t a new movie, it was a Star Wars marathon on a couch.", "YTA. Be with who you\u2019re with.", "NTA.\n\n- it wasn\u2019t a movie theatre \n- your phone wasn\u2019t bright or loud, and the room wasn\u2019t completely dark anyhow\n- you say you were only on your phone long enough to reply then put it back down \n- when you explained why, Katie said it was fine \n- you\u2019d spent hours spending quality time with these friends prior to watching the movies \n\nDon\u2019t understand all the y t as at all", "YTA\nFrom a woman 15 years older if I could say anything to myself in my early 20s it would be focus more on friendships than romantic relationships. \nIf I could have my time again I would be in a different position now if I refocused my energy", "YTA- hangup and hangout. If the guy is halfway decent he\u2019ll understand you\u2019re with friends and will get back to him at breaks between movies.", "YTA. Kinda rude & disrespectful of others trying to watch the shows. You could have excused yourself & left.", "NTA. I used to have a roommate who would pause the tv and sigh loudly if I got up to go to the bathroom or get a snack. She was extremely codependent.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve watched movies with Max.", "YTA - if you were at my place the movie would have been paused \ud83d\ude05", "YTA. How rude.", "YTA ... Youre watching a movie with a bunch of people. Respect them.", "YTA, that was really rude and I would have been angry too. BTW, way to sabotage a new relationship, texting every 10 minutes. Makes you seem like you've got nothing else going on.", "YTA", "put your fucking phone away - yta", "YTA. Obv.", "YTA", "YTA. Dude this is why I don\u2019t go to movies any more. People like you who can\u2019t get off their phones. Geez man if you can\u2019t stay off your phone don\u2019t go to a movie. YTA.", "Are you new on this planet? YTA. Stay off your phone at the movies.", "Honestly, I would say that you're n t a based on all the details you provided, but from your comments, it's obvious you're only here for validation.\n\nI think the people who gave you y t a either thought you were actually in a movie theater, missed the part where you guys were just watching this movie in silence and had actually caught up for several hours beforehand, or for whatever reason want to diagnose you with having a phone addiction and shame you for it.\n\nAnyway, I honestly think your friend \"Katie\" had to have been hyper-focused on you to have been distracted from a Star Wars movie by your texting as discreetly as you could (per your description), but at the same time, it wouldn't have killed you to let your new friend know that you were watching a movie and you'd talk to them later, so I sayyyy\n\nESH", "No one seems to understand you were all watching movies you\u2019re clearly very familiar with, considering you picked them as \u201cthe best ones\u201d\n\nNAH. I can\u2019t imagine there was any conversation happening among your friends, just that you weren\u2019t paying attention to a movie that YOUVE ALREADY SEEN, several times I assume. I understand your friend being annoyed at your phone lights in a dark living room, but you took literally nothing out of that friend time by texting during the movie imo.", "NTA.\n\nThey are movies you've all seen numerous times? But everyone went all lights low and serious and didn't say a peep? That's a weird vibe for me. Definitely not how my friends and I would view rewatch movies at all. I mean, it's NOT a movie theater. It should have been a casual experience. \n\nYou did everything you could to make sure your texting didn't interfere with everyone else's viewing. Was Katie sitting right next to you? Why was she so bothered by it if nobody else was? Was it her house? Her suggestion to watch those movies?", "Y\u2019all, the whole group was together for upwards of 10+ hours (\u201cseveral hours\u201d of catching up over food and drinks first according to OP and then THREE movies). I have to vote NAH. Katie didn\u2019t anticipate OP doing any texting, likely, and OP also tried to keep it respectful. I feel like this is a mismatch of expectations for a long, long day.", "Honestly unless I\u2019m actually at the movies watching a movie, I\u2019m probably on my phone during it. If there was a group of y\u2019all I don\u2019t understand why she was paying so much attention to you to feel the need to call you out. However I have ADHD so sitting through 3 back to back movies in silence without other stimulation sounds pouring hot grease into my eyeballs.", "Yta", "NTA\n\nYou're watching a freaking movie in silence. If you were tuning out of actually catching up then I'd say Y T A, but you weren't.", "NTA, im honestly confused on why people are crucifying you over this. You caught up with your friends (without the phone) for a few HOURS over drinks before the movies. Then they put on 3 movies back to back (so like 6-6.5 hours) in total silence?? And you\u2019re not allowed to silently text?? Not only is a 6hr silence in someones living room a horrible way to \u201ccatch up\u201d with friends, but I honestly can not imagine a world where id be so pissed at ONE person in a group of many who was texting during a movie we were all watching. If it was just you and one other person watching movies i can understand being upset, but to single you out is honestly a bit overbearing. I play dnd with my friends every friday, we sit at the table for a good 6-7hours. We all check our phones every now and again (including the DM!). My attention span would be out the window by movie #2, by movie #3 id be playing my own movie in my head lol", "Gonna go against the flow and say NTA. IMO texting every 10mins is not that frequent. And just because you're on the phone \"constantly\" doesn't mean you're \"not there\" with them. If you're new BF was there with you and you talk to them every 10mins \\*gasp\\*, would they consider it as not being with them?", "Lmao people in the comments want you to watch 6 or more hours of movies and pay constant attemtion to it. Also watching movies in silence isn't catching up or talking, you're not missing out on conversation, and/or ignoring your friends.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. How does being on your phone actually bother anyone?", "NTA I don\u2019t have the attention to make it through a movie so I take little phone breaks. It doesn\u2019t actually affect anyone if you\u2019re mindful", "YTA.  Even if the screen brightness was low, it's still bright enough to be noticeable and distract people from the movie they're watching.  If you didn't want to watch the movies, you should have excused yourself so you didn't ruin it for everyone else.", "Yes, YTA. You can turn off your phone without dying.", "I think everyone has losttheir minds. \n\nYou spent time with your friends and was texting your bf. \n\nNot talking on the phone. Brightness down. \nSo you were present while they watched a movie. \n\nNo one has thr right to tell someone they cant use their phone.\n\nU less you were all talking as well as watching and ignoring ppl it's no ones fucking buisness. \n\nNTA\n\nThe only A in that story is the person who heard your explanation and still tried to dictate what you did. Then hurt trip youthe next day.", "NTA at all and I can\u2019t believe the amount of people who are calling you T A\u2026 3 movies, that you\u2019ve already seen before is a lot. It\u2019s not like you removed yourself from the group.", "Ah the people who cannot live without their phone. \n\nThis is just rude behavior. Your new guy isn't telling you anything that can't wait. \n\nOr, excuse yourself to the other room. \n\nYTA.", "0", "Even with screen brightness down in full darkness that can be pretty annoying. Also rude asf for the person you're actually with. Learn quickly that not everything is about a new and potentially temporary addition to your life and that friends and being present for them is extremely important. I suggest you apologize and do something where theres no phones involved.", "IF you are at home, ntah, if you're in a theater, ytah...  sooooo, YTAH.", "YTA", "YTA, for a few reasons:\n\n* Using your phone during the movie is distracting to everyone else watching the movie. Don't argue about your brightness settings, or how it was just a few seconds each time. It's distracting. \n* Using your phone constantly while spending time with other people is disrespectful. It sends the message that they are not as important as the person you are interacting with on your phone.", "JFC YTA  and you are so self centered to not realize how your actions look to others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you were in someone's home or at a movie theater. You were invited to watch a movie. Not sit and text.  You could have told Max that you made plans and you would text him the next day  \n\nStop making excuses about how you spent time with them prior to watching the movies.  \nYou made plans with them and you completely disrespected them with your actions .", "YTA, because there is no reason to not fully engage with the people you are WITH and devote your time and attention to them during the event instead of continuously checking your phone for communications from the partner (or whomever is contacting you multiple times in a few hours without it being an emergency).\n\nYou were being rude. Your friend asked you twice to stop, and you didn't, and you're currently arguing with AITA peeps about that fact. \n\nIf you were so determined to have constant interactions with the partner, then why didn't you just leave and go be with them instead of agreeing to the movie? It's beyond me that you think your attention span isn't an issue, or that it wasn't disturbing to others in the room with you for you to check and reply to texts more than once. Even if you had silenced the alerts and had your brightness turned down - it is still pulling you out of the moment, and is disturbing to those sitting nearby.", "YTA.\n\nIf you're hanging with friends intending to watch a movie together, you watch the movie together.\n\nIf you wanted to text with someone else, you should've been hanging out with that someone else.\n\nSure, friends and couples hang out and look at their phones and text while watching a movie or tv, when the movie or tv is EXPRESSLY *background entertainment*.\n\nGoing to hang out with your friends and then continually be checking out from being present is rude as fuck. You're lucky only one friend said something, because they all felt it. And you're lucky she was as nice as she was, although as clueless as you seem to be, perhaps you needed a harsh reality check.", "It really depends on the situation. If you were in a movie theater it would be Y T A no question. Phones and even bright watches in the theater are incredibly rude. The same goes for if you were watching with the lights dimmed in a \"theater like\" environment. Then it's also pretty clear the focus should be on the film and your friends not your phone. \n\nThe only way this wouldn't be rude is if you were watching in a bright room and your friends hadn't asked you to put the phone away. YTA for ignoring her request and not putting the phone away after she asked.", "Bro me and my bestie watch TV together constantly, we both play on our phones,\n\nBUT the TV is used as background noise if we agree to watch a movie/show together our phones are face down and our watches are off, we pick them up during food/bathroom breaks,\n\nWatching movies with friends os a bonding experience imo, so YTA", "Your setting a bad precedent with your new relationship that you are available at his beck and call\u2026.

I love watching movies, but rarely have the attention span to do HOURS of movies, let alone ones I have seen before, without something else to do. \n\nYou get the judgement because you were asked to stop and fought it.

That is a conversation, not a quick text.\n\nImagine if it had been a LotR marathon!", "Gonna add some perspective:\n\nPhones are made for the purpose of communicating to someone far so that it would be as if you're right there with them. If we remove OP's phone in the equation, and make it that the new BF is with the friend group, and OP talks to him every 10mins or so, would that be considered rude and her not being there with her friends?\n\nWhat I mean is, unless she is completely ignoring her friend group while she's on the phone, then yes it's rude.

It's the lowest of the low as far as quality time goes.", "For not being able to put her phone down for like a fucking hour", "Nah it's rude lol", "Ah yes, the typical AITA poster coming here to be vindicated and shocked pikachu face when they find out they are, in fact, the asshole. YTA.", "It just sounds like obsessive new relationship behaviour", "This was a detail you either left out or just made up to help vindicate your asshole behaviour. I think the latter, based on your responses to the YTA comments I've seen so far.", "I consider flashing a screen and typing the same as talking during a movie. Rude and inconsiderate. Not 'sitting in silence'.", "Stop making excuses, the point isn't the setting, it's that your friends wanted to watch a movie with you and you were busy on your phone, your friend asked you twice to put it down, it's disrespectful and ik because I feel the same way when I used to tell my parents to watch tv with me but they'd do what you did, it hurt a lil and I stopped watching tv with them tbh.", "Episodes 4-6?  That's at best 6 1/2 hours.  \n\n\nTo me it would be an absolute aggravation to see out of the corner of my eye someone turning on their phone (unless the screen's off there's still light), tap in an answer then put it down...EVERY 10 minutes for 3 hours (all through the first film and halfway through the next).  \nWant to answer one or two messages?  Sure go ahead but if yer gonna have a full conversation then either leave the room or politely tell them that you're occupied.  \n\n\nOh and OP YTA.", "Right?! This is wild!", "It's super controlling to potentially ruin other people's paid enjoyment.\nIf you wanna text leave the theatre.", "But you suddenly had to respond to him every 10 minutes during a movie marathon?", "Do not care about your input.", "Yeah because 3 Star Wars movies is an hour. Especially if OPs already seen them multiple times\u2026 It\u2019s really not that big of a deal. Especially if you consider OP was talking to a guy they\u2019re in a new relationship with and is probably excited about\u2026 World isn\u2019t black and white", "I didn't think it was all that relevant and I have put it in other comments too. I can add it in", "Well I guess our group functions different compared to you and your parents", "Why does what someone else does aggravate you? Clearly you\u2019re in the majority, you\u2019re at someone\u2019s house watching movies, let people live.", "She said they were at someone\u2019s house.", "Yeah, I hadn't talked to him at all that day and he happens to like Star Wars too", "OP was texting every 10 mins. It's one thing to respond quickly to a message but having a full blown convo when you're with other people is so so rude", "And OP can't bare to not talk to max for a few hours. Oh woe is me!!!!!", "Does it matter now? It's not going to help your cause, IMHO.", "Except\u2026 it doesn\u2019t because one of your group told you to stop.", "Still being rude I see, YTA.", "You and my parents would do the same thing tho, I'd tell them to focus in this scene because it's funny, turn around and they're on their phone :// really annoyed me and when I'd tell them to put it down they'd tell me to calm down it's just a few seconds and tell me not to be uptight.", "Keep getting the negative karma. You truly deserve it. Now I know why you used a throwaway account. Even more YTA.", "Why ask for a judgement if you can\u2019t handle the answer?", "\ud83d\ude02 super sad girl. Keep up the terrible responses, I'm loving it.", "So you came on AITA and everyone says that YTA and you\u2019re arguing with us.", "I mean, clearly it doesn't if it was annoying people. Stop being rude, you should have stopped as soon as you got called out", "She did told you that she don\u2019t like you being on it", "Irrelevant really.\nHer friend asked her to stop, she didn't. She obviously ruined her friends enjoyment of said movies. And she doesn't seem to care and thinks she is in the right. She's a asshole.", "So go watch it with him, rather than flash a screen.", "Oh, you mean other people sitting in silence watching 3 movies that you\u2019ve seen multiple times?\n\nPeople have other shit going on and if they don\u2019t want to sit and stare at a television as opposed to a phone what\u2019s the problem?\n\nSome people enjoy things differently.", "Just one friend out of all of them, no one else had an issue", "You don't understand. You were supposed to vindicate her. She didn't expect you to actually be honest.", "Because, as in this real life situation, OP has no clue how to be a mature human. Social norms, like subreddit rules, do not apply to them.", "Yeah because that\u2019s crazy controlling. I would also not give in. If someone else texting ruins your night, it seems like a you problem.", "Shit take. Enjoy being a bad friend", "\u2026only one friend that said something. I\u2019m guessing there were multiple who were annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything.", "So that means that friend means nothing to you? Shake my head!", "Did you really just equate social norms and subreddit rules?? Chronically online", "Nice reach, considering you know nothing about me or my friends. That\u2019s rich coming from you, too", "Nope, I apologised and they told me I was fine. They do the same in other meetings too, it's not unusual", "Yes, I did. Neither is a law, and the only real consequence of breaking it is judgment from others. They're very similar."]}
