I have 2 small children -(5m and 1.5f). We were all at my grandma's house, opened presents, having a great time. \n\n*Let me give a back story for a second. My mom complains to me all the time that she hates when her mom tells her how to do anything in life. (Her dad, my maternal grandpa, was a pastor, her mom expected her to live up to every expectation they had and even into het 50s they tell her what shes doing wrong in her life.) This drives my mom nuts and she tells me all the time that she's an adult and she wishes her parents would stop telling her how to parent, how to spend money, etc. however, my mom likes to treat me the same way. She will give unwarranted parenting tips all the time, tell me I'm not enough of a helicopter parent, etc and it drives me absolutely bananas. Like, do you not see that you're being your mom? I digress...\n\nSo. It's our first Christmas without my paternal grandpa, at paternal gma and gpas house. I'm sad, as my grandpa isn't there .. he was my favorite human. We got done giving gifts, everyone is laughing and having a good time. My mom prepared my grandpa's signature cheesey potato soup for our brunch and we set in to eat. My daughter is a year and a half and sitting between my husband and I. We were taking turns pulling out chunks of our soup to cool off for said daughter to eat. I touched one of the potato pieces to my lips and it was cool enough to eat so I offered it to my daughter. \n\nShe ate it and made a face. She makes faces when she's not sure about textures or flavors, she's really only been eating for 9 months, of course she reacts to new foods. \n\nMy mom says: \"it's too hot!\" \nI say, \"I felt it, it's fine\" \nShe says \"you burned her, you have to pay attention!\" \n\nTo which i said, quite calmly for myself, \" I have 2 children, I know how to feed them, she's fine, thank you.\" \n\nMy mom's demeanor changed and she pouted for the rest of brunch and everyone changed the subject. I knew she was mad but I was happy for setting my boundary and I knew my daughter was fine, I literally tasted it first. \n\nMy mom calls me over after brunch was done and told me to apologize. I asked for what and she said for snapping. I told her I didn't snap, I told her my boundary that was already in place- I know how to parent - dont tell me what to do. She pouted and told me to apologize again. \n\nSo I gave her the old \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\"\n\nShe told me that wasn't an apology. \n\nI told her I wasn't sorry, so I'm sorry she felt that way. \n\nShe told me I was an asshole. \n\nI don't feel that I am.. I'm simply telling her I don't appreciate her stepping in where it's not necessary and I'm not sorry I firmly said what I said. So I told her, I'm not sorry for what I said, but I'm sorry you feel that way. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703747687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18snxgr/aita_for_telling_my_mom_im_sorry_you_feel_that_way/", "score": 392, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like you and your mum could benefit from a calm conversation about how she is perpetuating the same attitude that she dislikes from her mother. Communication, as usual in this sub, is the answer.\n\nPeople don't always see how their own actions are the same as they don't like being on the receiving end of, and it can sometimes require it being kindly pointed out by a third party. You say she's one of your best friends, and she's your mum, so surely this is not beyond the bounds of your relationship.", "ESH. And how can you be sure you didn't actually burn her?", "I get where you're coming from. One factor that may have concerned your mom would be if the potato was a piece / chunk as opposed to puree, pieces / chunks can be hotter at the center. Possibility that was her concern. Secondly, if it was too hot, the kid would've said \"hot\" or any such word, right? Unless she doesn't speak yet. But even then kids could indicate hot with gestures and sounds. So if the baby is capable of indicating if something is too hot, I'd say NTA.\nBut again, I don't know your tone when you replied to mom. So there is that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

These sort of people need to be told to fuck off.  Her response was perfect.  Mom demanded an apology, she got a sorry not sorry - perfect response.", "I really appreciate this. It's not easy to take a step back and acknowledge you're not good at compassionate communication. But that is so well said. Thank you.", "INFO Have you ever sat down and had a heart-to-heart discussion with your mom about all of this? Not shortly after it's happened either. Emotions are understandably heightened at that point, and the idea is to have a constructive dialog where both of you feel heard.\n\nIf you haven't talked with her about it, she probably felt your reaction was disproportionate to what she thinks is a single incident. She wouldn't know to what extent she keeps emotionally poking you in the same spot over and over until you can't take it anymore. She wouldn't realize it's been building up inside you.\n\nI know you said she complains about her own mother telling her how to do things, so you think she'd see she's doing the same thing. How could she miss it, right? \n\nInsight is a tricky thing though. If someone was raised in a house where their parents screamed at them, they're more likely to turn around and do the same thing when they have kids of their own, even though they know what it's like to be on the receiving end. It's so common it's refered to as \"breaking the cycle\" when it doesn't continue. I think a similar dynamic is going on here.\n\nTalk with your mom. Don't sound accusatory, as that puts the other person in a defensive position. If people feel \"attacked\" it's hard to have a productive discussion. Tell her you've seen how belittled and upset she feels over her own mother's constant advice. Explain that you know her heart is in the right place and she only says things because she cares, but it feels like she's judging you the same way her mom judges her. Let her know you don't want that to happen because she means so much to you, and ask her to work with you in finding a solution. \n\nCommunication can fix so many things. Sometimes we don't realize we're expecting the other person to read our minds, and it creates friction. This needs to remain an open and continuous discussion so you can work on it together as things come up. You got this \ud83d\udc9c", "No problem \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I\u2019m going to guess your mom is also not the best at it - it\u2019s hard to learn when it hasn\u2019t been modeled for us", "That's so true. My moms go to is guilt, hence, telling me I should apologize. My dad doesn't apologize - I've always only seen him say \"I'm sorry you feel...\" \"I'm sorry that bothers you\" etc. So my mom likes to guilt and my dad has taught me to deflect. It's a weird place to be as a very empathetic person. Thanks for all your insight.", "I actually think this was fine from you, in this context. You sympathise and empathise with your mom, you\u2019re truly sorry that this is how she feels. But you\u2019re not sorry for your own actions which were fine. It was accurate but you politely retained your boundary. NTA.", "Your Mom may have overreacted to your non-apology apology due to her having to  hear that shit from your father.

I'm learning to communicate my needs in a more healthy way and even if you don't like NEED therapy, I might recommend it for those purposes", "NTA", "You should have said I\u2019m sorry you have not learned from your mother and are treating me the same way she treats you.

Our elders really need to get it through their heads that we are adults and can respond in a way that disagrees with them, but is still respectful. I think your response was respectful.

Anyone who has that little faith in you is not a good influence in your life, and their opinion should mean nothing to you. Any verbal person without severe nerve damage can determine if something is too hot to feed a baby.

You have 2 kids who are presumably healthy, so you must be doing things right as a parent unless you left a lot of things out that would suggest otherwise.

I love you mom but I will ask you if I need any of your advice.", "NTA, but I think you need to spell it out for her and tell her she\u2019s acting like her own mother.

I mean is she so stubborn/think she's so right that it can't be any other way?\n\nI'm saying that because it sounds like your mother has never seen a baby who recently started eating.

She constantly complained about her mom, my grandma, getting on her about her weight and would do the same at me (never been overweight).
