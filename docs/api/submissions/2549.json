I personally found the comment harmless and would brush it off as a joke tbh so I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. I love my nephew with my whole heart but after spending a day with a small child it made me realize I couldn\u2019t be a parent. Maybe just explain to your sister you meant it as a light hearted joke and apologize because I\u2019m getting the sense you had no bad intentions", "NTA. I mean, it was insulting even if you intended it to be a joke.  However, it wasn\u2019t an insult toward your niece. It was an insult towards your sister and her boyfriend\u2019s shit parenting. You wouldn\u2019t have \u201cjoked\u201d about it at all if they had taught your niece how to behave when she\u2019s staying with people.

No one is attacking your parenting or whatever relevant experience you have. You\u2019re ranting in the comments like we know each other, and I\u2019ve personally offended you and it makes no sense.", "Nta it was a joke poking fun *at yourself* not the kids.", "I\u2019m leaning NTA\n\nFirstly kids are hard, and even harder when they\u2019re your responsibility 24/7. You haven\u2019t been responsible for them for an emergency overnight before, you suddenly saw first hand who tough it is and that maybe your not cut out of it.\n\nYou joked to your sister about a very serious issue that you think you\u2019re not cut out to me a parent. It was about you not her kids. Your mom is actually the one insulting the older child saying that if you could cops with the oldest you\u2019d be okay (implying something is off about the younger.", "NTA. I\u2019d prob laugh if I were your sister. Gonna assume she got offended cause she knows it\u2019s true lol\n\n I think other people\u2019s children will always be different than your own no matter how much time you spend with them. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on the idea for one misbehaving kid but honestly your family seems uptight lol.", "NTA- it's an old joke- What's the best birth control?  Babysitting someone else's child.", "I'll go with NTA. Mom of two here. The eldest is mostly a well-behaved kid, quiet, nice, shy, artsy etc. Has her moments still but it is expected. Knows how to be loud and does but not all the time. \n\nNow my youngest is a menace. I'm half joking that if he was the first he would've been the only one. Rebellious, destructive, uncooperative. It's damn hard to not loose my mind on a constant basis. So I understand. \n\nThe difference between you/your partner and the parents is the connection they have with the kids. They have the experience and knowledge of how to deal with the good and the bad. It takes time. Babysitting is not the same as parenting no matter how much time you spend doing it. \n\nI can't tell you that having your own will be easy. Can't tell you that it will be hard cause my own kids are proof it can be both. What I do know, and keep in mind it's not true for everyone, is that once they are born you just level up. I acquired skills i never had. I had little to no interaction with babies before and suddenly i know how to hold a newborn, know how to dress them, how to change a diaper, know the difference between a hungry cry and a sleepy one etc. \n\nAnd know that not having children is as a good choice as having them. Not everyone is cut for it and not everyone is meant to be a parent.", "NTA - it's a joke and she's your sister. \n\nI'll bet her being offended after the fact is just  defensiveness for knowing what a handful her younger child is and not feeling like she's done enough to address it. \n\nMy younger sister has three kids and I love them all, but the youngest is absolutely exhausting. She has said herself that if he'd been the first born, he would have been an only child.", "NTA. If she took the joke poorly, she could have taken you aside and privately told you that it was not ok and that it hurts to hear that. Instead, she decided to go nuclear and involve the entire family behind your back.\n\nSome people communicate using sarcasm. I think what you did was meant as a good-hearted jab, not as an insult. But not everyone understands sarcasm and its use to show affection.\n\n>and my mother is on my case saying if we could cope with the eldest we\u2019d be ok as parents\u2026\n\nAnd this has become an excuse to attack your life choices. Great...", "NAH. You clearly didn't mean it as an insult, just as a \"wow, I didn't realise what *really* went into raising a child on a day to day basis, I don't think I have what it takes or if it's what I even want, but you guys and parents in general are superheroes\". Though I may be biased, as that's pretty much my thoughts exactly.\n\nHowever, I do understand how a parent could take it the wrong way and feel insulted, I've found that parents tend to take anything said about their children that could be construed as negative very personally. You could definitely have worded it better imo, it's wise to be careful with what you say about a person's kids.", "NAH.  Some parents would\u2019ve been fine with that joke, or acknowledged their kid *is* a bit of a handful no matter how much they love them.  But your sister\u2019s reaction is also understandable and valid.  So just apologize, tell her it definitely says more about you than your niece, etc.  (And do brace yourself for more commentary if the inclination not to have kids sticks, because it sounds like your family might have some asshole tendencies in terms of thinking they get to weigh in on that.)", "I feel like it's different when you have kids. I find other people's kids quite stressful to babysit and having them over for a week would be a nightmare. I do not find my kids equally stressful. So if someone said something like that to me - even though rationally I am aware of the possibility that other people might find my kids equally as stressful as I find theirs - I think I would still be quite upset at my kid being insulted that way. \n\nIt just sounds like a mean-spirited comment (even if that's not how you meant it to come across). You could've said that everything went well, but that you admire her because you just couldn't do it because kids can be a lot when they're in a mood or something like that, without letting her know that babysitting her kids made you change your mind about having a baby.\n\nThat's why I'm going with YTA", "NTA it gave you an insight of what responsibilities could happen since not every child is perfect. I even tell my own kid thank God I only have one child not two  you're driving me nuts I even tell my idiot thank God I'm not having kids with you. Because I have my own problems and he has his since the house isn't balanced it wouldn't be fair to bring another in for the miserable ride.", "ESH I think. Dropping a huge bomb like that (we've been thinking about having kids for nearly a year, but a week with yours was so tough we've changed our minds') and playing it off as a joke is a weird and kind of insulting thing to say.\n\nBut it sounds like your family are blowing it way out of proportion, and it's not really your Mum's place to decide whether or not you should have kids.", "Honestly, I kind of think YTA cause it wasn\u2019t really a \u201cjoke\u201d... you have actually decided not to have kids because you couldn\u2019t deal with specifically one of your nieces\u2019 behavior. Not certain where the joke is in that statement. \u201cYour kid is such a pain in the ass, we decided not to have kids\u201d hahaha... it\u2019s really not that funny. \n\nThis is like having dinner with a friend & as they were leaving they say \u201cThanks for the lovely meal. After tonight I\u2019ve decided to never get married because your husband is such an AH\u201d..... You & your husband may feel mildly insulted. \n\nEta", "I don't blame you for feeling that way. If you've changed your minds it's probably for the best. You know your limits but CHRIST, you're not supposed to verbalize to the parents of the children you babysat for, your own flesh and blood no less. You could have been honest about the behavior of the youngest without insulting her children. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt was an insulting comment.  You insulted her child, intentionally, and by extension its an insult to your sister.  You also have zero experience with children, you don't understand them, and have no frame of reference on if the child's behavior was better or worse than any other child that age and the many other factors that affect children that can cause them to act out.\n\nI agree you should not have children.

They love their kids but hate the actual job of being a parent and say that if they could go back they wouldn't have kids at all. Apparently that's like the worst thing in the world to say because women especially get lambasted for not thinking motherhood is the best thing since rice krispie treats but not everyone loves being a mom and some people down right shouldn't even have kids at all. Finding out before you have a kid that you definitely don't want that job is a blessing to you and to your future non-kids.  People are going to call you selfish and a kid hater and say it's your duty as a woman to have kids but stay strong. It's ok not to want and not to have kids.", "NTA. However, it might be a good idea to offer an apology if the mom\u2019s feelings were hurt to maintain the peace. Not everyone is cut out for parenthood. Kudos to you for figuring that out early enough, but still desiring to babysit. I had my kids later than most, and they are my sun and moon, but I knew I wasn\u2019t ready for that in my 20s. Everyone is different, and I paused when I saw that you watched very young children for a week so their parents could go on vacation without them. That is almost unheard of where I live. That\u2019s a big ask for non-parents and she should be very thankful for your support. \nI remember saying that my nieces and nephews were birth control for me (my siblings are several years older and I was an aunt at 12). \nYou didn\u2019t say anything with malicious intent, nevertheless, an apology is the easiest solution.", "NTA. It was a joke.", "NTA but just apologise", "NTA. I honestly saw it as a joke at your own expense not at your sister's or her kids. You had them for a week, saw what was involved in having kids full time and figured out it wasn't for you and even mentioned you didn't know how your sister did it, which meant you couldn't. \n\nSo if anything, you're pretty much saying you'd be incompetent as a full time parent while respecting her as one. But maybe she's experiencing the early signs of teenagedom on her kids as they push boundaries and got sensitive and thought it was a commentary on her parenting. I'd clarify if I was you that it wasn't a jab at her but at yourself.", "NTA", "NTA - Joke or not, she needs to know that her younger child needs some reigning in. A couple of separate things here though... \n\n1. how the kids act is a direct response of the parenting. If the kids are a handful, demanding, mean, messy, etc... it's because the parents allow that or enable it.\n\n2. dealing with your (although beloved) nieces would be literally nothing like dealing with your own kids. Your own kids will behave the way you raise them to be (for the most part - they will still test some limits as they learn). If you raise them to be polite, listen, respect, clean up after themselves, etc and reinforce that behavior, that is the kind of child you will have.\n\nSo, I wouldn't decide to have kids or not based on a child that isn't being properly parented. And no, you were not an AH for calling it out. Your sister needs to be told what needs to be corrected in her child behavior. A lot of times the older child has all the responsibility dumped on them and the younger one runs wild, because parents become lenient or do the whole \"aww she's young, she'll grow out of it\". No. That's not how parenting works lol", "Not really TA, no one is in my mind. You probably should apologize to your sister; you singled out your niece. You could have said something that the experience, made you rethink your own kids, but babysitting is fun cause you love her kids. You definitely insulted her by singling out the niece, I would have been insulted too. It is ok to not want kids, not ok to insult people.

OP, I was a teacher and I have children. Having children made me realize that anyone who isn't 100% wanting to have kids, shouldn't. We have a child who was very sick for a while. We have a child with some disabilities. I can't imagine many people who wanted kids more than me, or who has more experience with children, but it was still HARD. I used to really push my brother and his wife that they should have kids, but now I tell them to do what they want. Having kids 24/7 is SO different from babysitting, nannying, or teaching. I sometimes joke that hanging out with kids is a really good form of birth control. I don't mean that my kids, or other kids, are monsters, but having to put someone else's needs first 24/7 is hard.

Being under ten also doesn\u2019t excuse it as you just said yourself that the brother was well-behaved. \n\nThey are shit parents because they elected to have a child-free weekend without making sure that *both* of their children were well-behaved enough to stay with other people. That is shit parenting as it puts unnecessary stress on both children and the people keeping them.\n\nThe sister\u2019s reaction is telling.

The kid is *seven*. Seven year olds sometimes have strong emotions and don't manage them properly. Seven year olds sometimes cut up to test boundaries. It's not a sign of shitty parenting, it's a sign of a child acting childish. So parents aren't allowed a few days away from their kid if there's even a slight change that kid might misbehave? Teenagers test boundaries, saying that a seven year old misbehaving a little bit is a sign they aren't being raised right is a massive stretch.\n\nOP isn't TA, but telling someone \"being around your kid made me not want to have my own\" is rude if not worded carefully.", "I think it's just an age thing. It's not really a question of \"good behaviour\" or \"bad behaviour\", so much as \"children gonna child\". Over a *week*, yeah a kid's going to be get a bit overtired, or cold, or hangry. They're going to get cranky, that's just how their brains work. They still need a bit of help to self-regulate. \n\nA well-behaved child at that age won't do it much, and will pull out of the crank before it hits tantrum stage. If \"your kids didn't do that\"?

There's no sign of particularly poor behaviour in the OP, it sounds to me like they were feeling a bit too much empathy, so it was distressing when the kid was upset.

I don't know if I'd discount being parents as an option just based on that experience alone, as it doesn't typify most parents' daily experience.

It's a super manipulative thing to say. The good/bad absolutism and being about one's core self instead of actions or circumstances. Setting up a scenario where there's a good chance the child will conclude their core self is in fact bad (\"well, I do hit sometimes and feel like hitting now, so...\"). Being contradictory (is she a good girl? She hits right? So what's with the first question? Entrapment ?).\n\n\nDo you see how the script the comment you were replying to is very different from that? Not saying that script would \"work\" every time depending on one's goals, but if you were trying to suggest in your reply that you'd done basically what they were saying, then it doesn't sound like you did.\n\n\nu/ConcentrateRegular79's example focuses on the immediate behavior and circumstances, not anybody's core self. Aside from the \"you're being very mean\", which is ambiguous because it could be seen as reading intent but can also be seen as categorizing behavior, everything is something the speaker credibly knows is true because it either references visible outside events or the speaker's own feelings. It doesn't set things up in moral or judgemental terms at all (again with the caveat over the ambiguity of \"mean\") but is a step-by-step explanation of cause and effect. Every part of the statement is consistent and at least plausibly true - like, the speaker could still be lying, or fail to follow up on the predicted actions, but they're not saying things that are clearly untrue. It frames the situation as an interpersonal conflict where the adult has their own needs that they value and defend, instead of a pure test of virtue for the child.\n\n\nThose are a few differences that I think can make a difference in how the statement is received. Not again to say it would \"work\" where yours didn't, or that only statements that do those things would \"work\". But talking about situations instead of core selves and of our internal feelings instead of theirs is less likely to spark defensiveness. Making true statements reduces one possible hurdle to a child accepting the message as useful. Describing the situation and the cause and effect relationships (that one has the ability and intent to follow through on obviously) gives actual information the child might learn from. Describing the situation as a conflict between two people with needs is more likely to invite empathy and problem-solving as a response than describing it as one person being good or bad does.", "No the comments *are* like for like.

Would zoom into my room if I had my door open a crack, gnawed open a corner of the dogs bag of food and you could hear him chomping in the middle of the night;  if you opened the back door connecting our mud room to our basement without making sure you were clear of kitty, he would dart down the stairs and you would find him on the windowsill, covered in dust.  He peed in his cat carrier on the way to the vet.  Twice.  And we only had him from August-last week.  \n\nKitty was a gremlin.  A monster of chaos.

The fact that you have been looking after them since infancy like you mentioned, as well as having worked in a school with children, to then call out your niece specifically must be quite the shock. Especially if this is the first she's heard of it from you, and your first way of bringing up her difficulty is by saying that it made you not want to be a parent. Yikes. So in this regard, I do think you owe your sister an apology. I don't think you meant for it to be hurtful. I don't think her reaction is unwarranted. I do think you should apologise and explain to clear the air, otherwise she might end up thinking you secretly hate your niece from your perceived 0-100 statement.", "The truth hurts.", "YTA it has nothing to do with the child it has to do with you obviously not knowing what it's like to have children.", "Yta, if only because it wasnt a joke?

You don\u2019t have to be sorry for how you feel, but you might be sorry for how she took your joke.", "YTA - I don't think you meant it that way but it is a hurtful comment for a parent to hear directed at their child, and it doesn't sound like the kids are awful, they're just kids. \n\nAs a side note - I think you've made a wise decision to hold off on having kids. Having kids is no easy decision and you absolutely should know that you want it before committing. So good call there. \n\nAlthough I'll follow that up with a \"don't write having kids off completely\". Kids have their ages where they are particularly annoying/difficult. I love all my nieces and nephews, but they've all been an age at one point or other where I'd be lying if I said I loved their company/loved looking after them. \ud83d\ude05 Then they inevitably grow out of whatever short stage they're in and they become lovely. \nStill, it's something you want to definitely be sure you want to do before committing, though.

She said she didn\u2019t think it was right to be a parent that\u2019s agitated at a child\u2019s negative emotions and she\u2019s right. Her issue isnt the children, it isn\u2019t her sisters parenting, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t have the desire to deal with children. Calling into question her sisters parenting is uncalled for. Best parents in the universe couldn\u2019t raise a child that at 7 has the emotional intelligence to act as a proper and well behaved house guest for a week without any reactive outbursts. The child is 7, she was away from her parents for a week and it was probably a rough adjustment for her.

There are so many posts here admonishing parents for not standing up for their kids when other do things like this, and your sister is one that\u2019s actually pushed back. \n\nLong story short, it\u2019s your choice whether or not to have kids, but you don\u2019t need to punch down to make your point.

It does depends on what concerns you have about a partner or a child and what experience you have, and so rarely I think they actually could be comparable. \n\nIn general tho, not so much. Most people have experience with partners before they decide to keep one forever, whereas a lot of people don't have experience having a child 24/7 before they decide to have one forever.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I think that calling out a specific child isn't a good thing to do, it's just that comparing situations here isn't reasonable in general", "It\u2019s interesting, because over 1,600 other people agree with me, but go off.", "The realisation is valid - saying specifically to a child's mother that one particular kid was so difficult it put you off, is insulting the child.
