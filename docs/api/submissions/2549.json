I personally found the comment harmless and would brush it off as a joke tbh so I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. I love my nephew with my whole heart but after spending a day with a small child it made me realize I couldn\u2019t be a parent. Maybe just explain to your sister you meant it as a light hearted joke and apologize because I\u2019m getting the sense you had no bad intentions", "NTA. I mean, it was insulting even if you intended it to be a joke.  However, it wasn\u2019t an insult toward your niece. It was an insult towards your sister and her boyfriend\u2019s shit parenting. You wouldn\u2019t have \u201cjoked\u201d about it at all if they had taught your niece how to behave when she\u2019s staying with people.

No one is attacking your parenting or whatever relevant experience you have. You\u2019re ranting in the comments like we know each other, and I\u2019ve personally offended you and it makes no sense.", "Nta it was a joke poking fun *at yourself* not the kids.", "I\u2019m leaning NTA\n\nFirstly kids are hard, and even harder when they\u2019re your responsibility 24/7. You haven\u2019t been responsible for them for an emergency overnight before, you suddenly saw first hand who tough it is and that maybe your not cut out of it.\n\nYou joked to your sister about a very serious issue that you think you\u2019re not cut out to me a parent. It was about you not her kids. Your mom is actually the one insulting the older child saying that if you could cops with the oldest you\u2019d be okay (implying something is off about the younger.", "NTA. I\u2019d prob laugh if I were your sister. Gonna assume she got offended cause she knows it\u2019s true lol\n\n I think other people\u2019s children will always be different than your own no matter how much time you spend with them. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on the idea for one misbehaving kid but honestly your family seems uptight lol.", "NTA- it's an old joke- What's the best birth control?  Babysitting someone else's child.", "I'll go with NTA. Mom of two here. The eldest is mostly a well-behaved kid, quiet, nice, shy, artsy etc. Has her moments still but it is expected. Knows how to be loud and does but not all the time. \n\nNow my youngest is a menace. I'm half joking that if he was the first he would've been the only one. Rebellious, destructive, uncooperative. It's damn hard to not loose my mind on a constant basis. So I understand. \n\nThe difference between you/your partner and the parents is the connection they have with the kids. They have the experience and knowledge of how to deal with the good and the bad. It takes time. Babysitting is not the same as parenting no matter how much time you spend doing it. \n\nI can't tell you that having your own will be easy. Can't tell you that it will be hard cause my own kids are proof it can be both. What I do know, and keep in mind it's not true for everyone, is that once they are born you just level up. I acquired skills i never had. I had little to no interaction with babies before and suddenly i know how to hold a newborn, know how to dress them, how to change a diaper, know the difference between a hungry cry and a sleepy one etc. \n\nAnd know that not having children is as a good choice as having them. Not everyone is cut for it and not everyone is meant to be a parent.", "NTA - it's a joke and she's your sister. \n\nI'll bet her being offended after the fact is just  defensiveness for knowing what a handful her younger child is and not feeling like she's done enough to address it. \n\nMy younger sister has three kids and I love them all, but the youngest is absolutely exhausting. She has said herself that if he'd been the first born, he would have been an only child.", "NTA. If she took the joke poorly, she could have taken you aside and privately told you that it was not ok and that it hurts to hear that. Instead, she decided to go nuclear and involve the entire family behind your back.\n\nSome people communicate using sarcasm. I think what you did was meant as a good-hearted jab, not as an insult. But not everyone understands sarcasm and its use to show affection.\n\n>and my mother is on my case saying if we could cope with the eldest we\u2019d be ok as parents\u2026\n\nAnd this has become an excuse to attack your life choices. Great...", "NAH. You clearly didn't mean it as an insult, just as a \"wow, I didn't realise what *really* went into raising a child on a day to day basis, I don't think I have what it takes or if it's what I even want, but you guys and parents in general are superheroes\". Though I may be biased, as that's pretty much my thoughts exactly.\n\nHowever, I do understand how a parent could take it the wrong way and feel insulted, I've found that parents tend to take anything said about their children that could be construed as negative very personally. You could definitely have worded it better imo, it's wise to be careful with what you say about a person's kids.", "NAH.  Some parents would\u2019ve been fine with that joke, or acknowledged their kid *is* a bit of a handful no matter how much they love them.  But your sister\u2019s reaction is also understandable and valid.  So just apologize, tell her it definitely says more about you than your niece, etc.  (And do brace yourself for more commentary if the inclination not to have kids sticks, because it sounds like your family might have some asshole tendencies in terms of thinking they get to weigh in on that.)", "I feel like it's different when you have kids. I find other people's kids quite stressful to babysit and having them over for a week would be a nightmare. I do not find my kids equally stressful. So if someone said something like that to me - even though rationally I am aware of the possibility that other people might find my kids equally as stressful as I find theirs - I think I would still be quite upset at my kid being insulted that way. \n\nIt just sounds like a mean-spirited comment (even if that's not how you meant it to come across). You could've said that everything went well, but that you admire her because you just couldn't do it because kids can be a lot when they're in a mood or something like that, without letting her know that babysitting her kids made you change your mind about having a baby.\n\nThat's why I'm going with YTA", "NTA it gave you an insight of what responsibilities could happen since not every child is perfect. I even tell my own kid thank God I only have one child not two  you're driving me nuts I even tell my idiot thank God I'm not having kids with you. Because I have my own problems and he has his since the house isn't balanced it wouldn't be fair to bring another in for the miserable ride.", "ESH I think. Dropping a huge bomb like that (we've been thinking about having kids for nearly a year, but a week with yours was so tough we've changed our minds') and playing it off as a joke is a weird and kind of insulting thing to say.\n\nBut it sounds like your family are blowing it way out of proportion, and it's not really your Mum's place to decide whether or not you should have kids.", "Honestly, I kind of think YTA cause it wasn\u2019t really a \u201cjoke\u201d... you have actually decided not to have kids because you couldn\u2019t deal with specifically one of your nieces\u2019 behavior. Not certain where the joke is in that statement. \u201cYour kid is such a pain in the ass, we decided not to have kids\u201d hahaha... it\u2019s really not that funny. \n\nThis is like having dinner with a friend & as they were leaving they say \u201cThanks for the lovely meal. After tonight I\u2019ve decided to never get married because your husband is such an AH\u201d..... You & your husband may feel mildly insulted. \n\nEta", "I don't blame you for feeling that way. If you've changed your minds it's probably for the best. You know your limits but CHRIST, you're not supposed to verbalize to the parents of the children you babysat for, your own flesh and blood no less. You could have been honest about the behavior of the youngest without insulting her children. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt was an insulting comment.  You insulted her child, intentionally, and by extension its an insult to your sister.  You also have zero experience with children, you don't understand them, and have no frame of reference on if the child's behavior was better or worse than any other child that age and the many other factors that affect children that can cause them to act out.\n\nI agree you should not have children.

They love their kids but hate the actual job of being a parent and say that if they could go back they wouldn't have kids at all. Apparently that's like the worst thing in the world to say because women especially get lambasted for not thinking motherhood is the best thing since rice krispie treats but not everyone loves being a mom and some people down right shouldn't even have kids at all. Finding out before you have a kid that you definitely don't want that job is a blessing to you and to your future non-kids.  People are going to call you selfish and a kid hater and say it's your duty as a woman to have kids but stay strong. It's ok not to want and not to have kids.", "NTA. However, it might be a good idea to offer an apology if the mom\u2019s feelings were hurt to maintain the peace. Not everyone is cut out for parenthood. Kudos to you for figuring that out early enough, but still desiring to babysit. I had my kids later than most, and they are my sun and moon, but I knew I wasn\u2019t ready for that in my 20s. Everyone is different, and I paused when I saw that you watched very young children for a week so their parents could go on vacation without them. That is almost unheard of where I live. That\u2019s a big ask for non-parents and she should be very thankful for your support. \nI remember saying that my nieces and nephews were birth control for me (my siblings are several years older and I was an aunt at 12). \nYou didn\u2019t say anything with malicious intent, nevertheless, an apology is the easiest solution.", "NTA. It was a joke.", "NTA but just apologise", "NTA. I honestly saw it as a joke at your own expense not at your sister's or her kids. You had them for a week, saw what was involved in having kids full time and figured out it wasn't for you and even mentioned you didn't know how your sister did it, which meant you couldn't. \n\nSo if anything, you're pretty much saying you'd be incompetent as a full time parent while respecting her as one. But maybe she's experiencing the early signs of teenagedom on her kids as they push boundaries and got sensitive and thought it was a commentary on her parenting. I'd clarify if I was you that it wasn't a jab at her but at yourself.", "NTA", "NTA - Joke or not, she needs to know that her younger child needs some reigning in. A couple of separate things here though... \n\n1. how the kids act is a direct response of the parenting. If the kids are a handful, demanding, mean, messy, etc... it's because the parents allow that or enable it.\n\n2. dealing with your (although beloved) nieces would be literally nothing like dealing with your own kids. Your own kids will behave the way you raise them to be (for the most part - they will still test some limits as they learn). If you raise them to be polite, listen, respect, clean up after themselves, etc and reinforce that behavior, that is the kind of child you will have.\n\nSo, I wouldn't decide to have kids or not based on a child that isn't being properly parented. And no, you were not an AH for calling it out. Your sister needs to be told what needs to be corrected in her child behavior. A lot of times the older child has all the responsibility dumped on them and the younger one runs wild, because parents become lenient or do the whole \"aww she's young, she'll grow out of it\". No. That's not how parenting works lol", "Not really TA, no one is in my mind. You probably should apologize to your sister; you singled out your niece. You could have said something that the experience, made you rethink your own kids, but babysitting is fun cause you love her kids. You definitely insulted her by singling out the niece, I would have been insulted too. It is ok to not want kids, not ok to insult people.

OP, I was a teacher and I have children. Having children made me realize that anyone who isn't 100% wanting to have kids, shouldn't. We have a child who was very sick for a while. We have a child with some disabilities. I can't imagine many people who wanted kids more than me, or who has more experience with children, but it was still HARD. I used to really push my brother and his wife that they should have kids, but now I tell them to do what they want. Having kids 24/7 is SO different from babysitting, nannying, or teaching. I sometimes joke that hanging out with kids is a really good form of birth control. I don't mean that my kids, or other kids, are monsters, but having to put someone else's needs first 24/7 is hard.

Being under ten also doesn\u2019t excuse it as you just said yourself that the brother was well-behaved. \n\nThey are shit parents because they elected to have a child-free weekend without making sure that *both* of their children were well-behaved enough to stay with other people. That is shit parenting as it puts unnecessary stress on both children and the people keeping them.\n\nThe sister\u2019s reaction is telling.

The kid is *seven*. Seven year olds sometimes have strong emotions and don't manage them properly. Seven year olds sometimes cut up to test boundaries. It's not a sign of shitty parenting, it's a sign of a child acting childish. So parents aren't allowed a few days away from their kid if there's even a slight change that kid might misbehave? Teenagers test boundaries, saying that a seven year old misbehaving a little bit is a sign they aren't being raised right is a massive stretch.\n\nOP isn't TA, but telling someone \"being around your kid made me not want to have my own\" is rude if not worded carefully.", "I think it's just an age thing. It's not really a question of \"good behaviour\" or \"bad behaviour\", so much as \"children gonna child\". Over a *week*, yeah a kid's going to be get a bit overtired, or cold, or hangry. They're going to get cranky, that's just how their brains work. They still need a bit of help to self-regulate. \n\nA well-behaved child at that age won't do it much, and will pull out of the crank before it hits tantrum stage. If \"your kids didn't do that\"?

There's no sign of particularly poor behaviour in the OP, it sounds to me like they were feeling a bit too much empathy, so it was distressing when the kid was upset.

Looking after kids at that age is a remarkably different experience than looking after younger kids/babies.   \n\n\nHaving your own children gives you the chance to improve upon how you feel your sister's kids turned out. Learn from her mistakes, y'know what I mean?  \n\n\nAlls I'm saying is just don't rule out having your own based on that one experience. You could end up being a far better parent than your sister. Hell, make it a competition. \n\nAgain, NAH. It's just a differing of perfectly valid opinions.", "NTA. You were only joking and your sister is being overly sensitive.", "It was the delivery that makes you a very light AH. The sentiment was true, just not the moment or way to say it.", "NTA.  You made a little joke that if your sister did not like she could have said something to you in the moment, or just let it go.  Instead she went and stirred up drama with the family over something that was not a big deal. Her communicating with you directly would have solved the situation, but instead she just went and made a mess.", "NTA She took that free babysitter without complaint!", "Did you say this in front of the kid?  Because... Ouch.\nYTA", "YTA. What you're dealing with now are the consequences of rudeness. It's fine for you to decide not to have kids, but essentially telling a parent \"your kids were so awful it made us not want kids!\" is pretty shit. Why was that necessary? You could have made the decision privately and not specified the reason. You definitely owe your sister an apology.\n\nAnd as an aside, you had 1 week with kids when you don't have any established routines, where they don't see you as the authority, where you aren't empowered to properly discipline or create consequences for bad behavior, and where you are having to suddenly adapt your normal life with this new added stress. I don't know if I'd discount being parents as an option just based on that experience alone, as it doesn't typify most parents' daily experience. Most parents have more solidified routines and strategies. I would go stay an extended period in the home of someone with a kid or two and see how the child behaves in their normal environment.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you just apologize and say you didn\u2019t mean it that way. It was a fairly thoughtless thing to say, even if not meant seriously", "NTA I think you should get a little more experience with kids before you decide. Also remember people always have more patience with their own kids versus someone else\u2019s. My friend wanted a dog because of my dog and then realized I trained my dog after she got hers. He\u2019s a crazy little thing, a little training and he\u2019s better. I hate comparing kids to animals but it\u2019s almost the same. Everyone raises their kids differently and if you made the choice based off of her kids, one thing is to remember if you will parent the same way. \n\nMy aunt always said I was welcome at her home, my other cousins only came when she had a big cousins sleepover. It\u2019s 19 of us. My other aunt has 2 kids that were only invited to some events because they were spoiled rotten and ruined things. We are closer as adults, but parenting is a big factor on having kids.", "I'm going against the grain. Imma have to say YTA. But I do believe you are redeemable.\n\nI do think you phrased the joke wrong. I don't see you intentionally insulting the youngest but you have to remember that that is what the mom heard. So while you may take it as one thing, she heard another. \n\nIt would be best to apologize. It was a tasteless joke that came across wrong.", "Can\u2019t believe all the n t a answers in here, that is absolutely an incredibly rude thing to say regardless of whether or not you intended it as a joke\u2026 and tbh I don\u2019t think you WERE joking.

I tell people all the time that I no longer wanted to be a mom after I became an aunt. I love my nieces dearly, but they opened my eyes to how much responsibility being a parent is.", "Nta. If they were such easy kids why did your sister need a week away from them?", "NTA", "I think you are being too hard on yourself. Having kids is a lot of work. You are not used to it, so it's no surprise that you are pooped out. Also, you are not watching your own kids. You have a different connection to your niblings than you would your own children. I don't think you should make your decision to be parents based on babysitting for a week.  It's just not a great frame of reference.\n\nNTA\n\nI would have laughed at your comment.

I think the joke needed a different audience than the mother of who you're complaining about, though.", "NTA your sister is mad that her kids are bad as hell.. if she raised them to act better you wouldnt feel how you feel.. its always the SAME type of ppl.. she needs to get over it, or teach her kids to behave better", "NTA - minding children is hard hard work.  Its a lot easier to go to a paying job. \n\nI don't know how your sister can be insulted.  You said that you couldn't do her job, minding her children.  You didn't say that your children would be better - you basically said that your children wouldn't be much better, which could well be the truth !", "NTA.  My sister used to ask to babysit my daughter when she was little to cure her \"baby fever\".  She called my daughter...\"Brittany birth control\".  Never offended me or her dad.  We thought it was funny.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want people talking negatively about her kids\u2019 behavior she should have taught them to behave better.", "NTA.   You made one joke after taking care of her kids for a week.  Rather than take it with good grace, she went whining to your mother.", "NTA I guess, but if my sister said that about my daughter I'd be really hurt and probably keep my kid away from her going forward.", "Shit parents are the ones that complain loudest about being called shit parents. \n\nNTA", "Nta, FTK!!!!", "NAH You meant it as a joke, it didn't land. Apologize but congratulations on your enlightenment and don't forget why you made this choice for your future.", "NAH. It's the sort of joke that would fly with my friends, but not with everyone. \n\nWhat you said did hurt your sister's feelings, she likely heard, \"your kids are so terrible I never want to be around them or any child again.\" \n\nWhat I think you meant was \"the kids were awesome and we had a great time, but getting chance to spend so much time with them made s/o and I realize that we are thrilled to be babysitters, but are maybe not cut out to be parents.\"\n\nI totally get why your sister laughed it off, no getting into in front of the kids, as for going to your mother, if you three normally have a good relationship, then yeah, she's gonna vent to her mom.\n\nAs to your mother's comment that you could cope, nope. It doesn't matter how great of an aunt you are, if parenting isn't for you, then it's not for you. AND THATS OK.", "INFO. What exactly did you mean about \"bad moments\"? It really makes me wonder whether child was a nightmare or you are just not really cut for taking care of one.\n\nAlso, there is always time and place for everything.

Like at its core OP said this kid is the reason why she doesn\u2019t want children. She wasn\u2019t being ironic. That\u2019s gonna hurt a mother.", "Agreed. Even if it's a joke, it's a rude and unfunny joke.

Kids are hard. And people tend to forget that they are whole new person with their own personality and feelings. My oldest is a very easy well behaved kid. My youngest is for the most part well behaved but is A LOT more emotional and is still learning how to properly handle said emotions. It can be rough at points but that's where the parenting is supposed to come in. It won't be an overnight change but in the long run they can and will learn to be a member of society.  Kids are kids.", "Shouldn't the niece be allowed to be particularly bad? She's a child. Based on the fact that the niece was singled out, she was probably much worse behaved than the nephew during that week. And that's okay, she's a child. That's what kids do.\n\nI think it's quite reasonable to say that she isn't parenting material AND the niece was probably badly behaved. I remember some times when I behaved badly as a kid.

Apparently that's how it works according to reddit.", "Yea. Kids are kids. If it's just them being emotional then that's natural and it's mature of op and their partner to realize they're not up for that. If it was actually misbehavior then yes it could come down to the children not being raised properly- but also something to take into consideration all kids are going to oush boundaries at times and they actually push them harder with people they are comfortable with. So a little push back at times is a good sign because it shows your child trusts you to be at their worse and not lose you.

That's the sort of thing I'd apologize for - not because I did wrong, but because I still caused harm regardless of intent.
