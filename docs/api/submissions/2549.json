The youngest can be quite sassy but then they could have their bad moments, and I just can\u2019t imagine dealing with  that, so a week of babysitting me and my partner decided we are most definitely not suited to be parents - it wouldn\u2019t be fair to a child for their parent to be agitated whenever they experience a negative emotion, I\u2019m fine with babysitting children - I used to work in a school, brief time but even then this was hugely different.\n\nI\u2019d spoken to my sister when she came to pick up the children and she asked how it was, I as a joke said to her oh yeah, thanks to (I did specifically say younger niece, but that\u2019s because the eldest was well behaved) we\u2019ve decided not to have children! I don\u2019t know how you do it!!\n\nShe laughed it off, I thought it was a harmless comment as I\u2019ve been helping babysit since the youngest was like 1, obviously I love them.\n\nBut sister complained to my mother about \u201cinsulting\u201d her children, now everyone\u2019s calling me an AH and my mother is on my case saying if we could cope with the eldest we\u2019d be ok as parents\u2026\n\nMy friend said I should just apologise to my sister as she\u2019s the mother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668691558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxq78q/aita_for_joking_that_my_niece_is_the_reason_i/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I personally found the comment harmless and would brush it off as a joke tbh so I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. I love my nephew with my whole heart but after spending a day with a small child it made me realize I couldn\u2019t be a parent. Maybe just explain to your sister you meant it as a light hearted joke and apologize because I\u2019m getting the sense you had no bad intentions", "NTA. I mean, it was insulting even if you intended it to be a joke.  However, it wasn\u2019t an insult toward your niece. It was an insult towards your sister and her boyfriend\u2019s shit parenting. You wouldn\u2019t have \u201cjoked\u201d about it at all if they had taught your niece how to behave when she\u2019s staying with people. Your sister might be telling everyone she\u2019s upset because \u201cyou insulted her child,\u201d but really she\u2019s mad you called her out on her bad parenting.", "Nta it was a joke poking fun *at yourself* not the kids.", "I\u2019m leaning NTA\n\nFirstly kids are hard, and even harder when they\u2019re your responsibility 24/7. You haven\u2019t been responsible for them for an emergency overnight before, you suddenly saw first hand who tough it is and that maybe your not cut out of it.\n\nYou joked to your sister about a very serious issue that you think you\u2019re not cut out to me a parent. It was about you not her kids. Your mom is actually the one insulting the older child saying that if you could cops with the oldest you\u2019d be okay (implying something is off about the younger.", "NTA. I\u2019d prob laugh if I were your sister. Gonna assume she got offended cause she knows it\u2019s true lol\n\n I think other people\u2019s children will always be different than your own no matter how much time you spend with them. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on the idea for one misbehaving kid but honestly your family seems uptight lol.", "NTA- it's an old joke- What's the best birth control?  Babysitting someone else's child.", "I'll go with NTA. Mom of two here. The eldest is mostly a well-behaved kid, quiet, nice, shy, artsy etc. Has her moments still but it is expected. Knows how to be loud and does but not all the time. \n\nNow my youngest is a menace. I'm half joking that if he was the first he would've been the only one. Rebellious, destructive, uncooperative. It's damn hard to not loose my mind on a constant basis. So I understand. \n\nThe difference between you/your partner and the parents is the connection they have with the kids. They have the experience and knowledge of how to deal with the good and the bad. It takes time. Babysitting is not the same as parenting no matter how much time you spend doing it. \n\nI can't tell you that having your own will be easy. Can't tell you that it will be hard cause my own kids are proof it can be both. What I do know, and keep in mind it's not true for everyone, is that once they are born you just level up. I acquired skills i never had. I had little to no interaction with babies before and suddenly i know how to hold a newborn, know how to dress them, how to change a diaper, know the difference between a hungry cry and a sleepy one etc. \n\nAnd know that not having children is as a good choice as having them. Not everyone is cut for it and not everyone is meant to be a parent.", "NTA - it's a joke and she's your sister. \n\nI'll bet her being offended after the fact is just  defensiveness for knowing what a handful her younger child is and not feeling like she's done enough to address it. \n\nMy younger sister has three kids and I love them all, but the youngest is absolutely exhausting. She has said herself that if he'd been the first born, he would have been an only child.", "NTA. If she took the joke poorly, she could have taken you aside and privately told you that it was not ok and that it hurts to hear that. Instead, she decided to go nuclear and involve the entire family behind your back.\n\nSome people communicate using sarcasm. I think what you did was meant as a good-hearted jab, not as an insult. But not everyone understands sarcasm and its use to show affection.\n\n>and my mother is on my case saying if we could cope with the eldest we\u2019d be ok as parents\u2026\n\nAnd this has become an excuse to attack your life choices. Great...", "NAH. You clearly didn't mean it as an insult, just as a \"wow, I didn't realise what *really* went into raising a child on a day to day basis, I don't think I have what it takes or if it's what I even want, but you guys and parents in general are superheroes\". Though I may be biased, as that's pretty much my thoughts exactly.\n\nHowever, I do understand how a parent could take it the wrong way and feel insulted, I've found that parents tend to take anything said about their children that could be construed as negative very personally. You could definitely have worded it better imo, it's wise to be careful with what you say about a person's kids.", "NAH.  Some parents would\u2019ve been fine with that joke, or acknowledged their kid *is* a bit of a handful no matter how much they love them.  But your sister\u2019s reaction is also understandable and valid.  So just apologize, tell her it definitely says more about you than your niece, etc.  (And do brace yourself for more commentary if the inclination not to have kids sticks, because it sounds like your family might have some asshole tendencies in terms of thinking they get to weigh in on that.)", "I feel like it's different when you have kids. I find other people's kids quite stressful to babysit and having them over for a week would be a nightmare. I do not find my kids equally stressful. So if someone said something like that to me - even though rationally I am aware of the possibility that other people might find my kids equally as stressful as I find theirs - I think I would still be quite upset at my kid being insulted that way. \n\nIt just sounds like a mean-spirited comment (even if that's not how you meant it to come across). You could've said that everything went well, but that you admire her because you just couldn't do it because kids can be a lot when they're in a mood or something like that, without letting her know that babysitting her kids made you change your mind about having a baby.\n\nThat's why I'm going with YTA", "NTA it gave you an insight of what responsibilities could happen since not every child is perfect. I even tell my own kid thank God I only have one child not two  you're driving me nuts I even tell my idiot thank God I'm not having kids with you. Because I have my own problems and he has his since the house isn't balanced it wouldn't be fair to bring another in for the miserable ride.", "ESH I think. Dropping a huge bomb like that (we've been thinking about having kids for nearly a year, but a week with yours was so tough we've changed our minds') and playing it off as a joke is a weird and kind of insulting thing to say.\n\nBut it sounds like your family are blowing it way out of proportion, and it's not really your Mum's place to decide whether or not you should have kids.", "Honestly, I kind of think YTA cause it wasn\u2019t really a \u201cjoke\u201d... you have actually decided not to have kids because you couldn\u2019t deal with specifically one of your nieces\u2019 behavior. Not certain where the joke is in that statement. \u201cYour kid is such a pain in the ass, we decided not to have kids\u201d hahaha... it\u2019s really not that funny. \n\nThis is like having dinner with a friend & as they were leaving they say \u201cThanks for the lovely meal. After tonight I\u2019ve decided to never get married because your husband is such an AH\u201d..... You & your husband may feel mildly insulted. \n\nEta", "I don't blame you for feeling that way. If you've changed your minds it's probably for the best. You know your limits but CHRIST, you're not supposed to verbalize to the parents of the children you babysat for, your own flesh and blood no less. You could have been honest about the behavior of the youngest without insulting her children. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt was an insulting comment.  You insulted her child, intentionally, and by extension its an insult to your sister.  You also have zero experience with children, you don't understand them, and have no frame of reference on if the child's behavior was better or worse than any other child that age and the many other factors that affect children that can cause them to act out.\n\nI agree you should not have children.  You clearly lack what it takes to look after another human being in that way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your comment wasn't terribly out of line nor was there any intention to cause offense, nor was it unfair.  Nonetheless, your sister feels hurt.\n\nEverybody else's reactions are over-the-top, though, and definitely end up as asshole reactions to a mild and quite normal joke.\n\nSo, given that I feel that you are maybe just barely in the asshole category and everybody else definitely is, I find myself surprised that I am ending up with\nESH", "NTA.

But I think you know making that comment to the mother of the child in question, was in poor taste. \n\nGranted, your sister shouldn't have blown it out of proportion or dragged your mother into it. And your mother certainly shouldn't be commenting on whether you are fit to be a parent or not, it's not her place or her decision. \n\nAs a mother, I am not easily offended if someone close enough (like family) makes a little joke about my son's behavior --he's not ill-behaved but admittedly he can be quite energetic and sometimes also too demanding of an adult (wanting you to play with him, show you his toys, etc., when you are not really up for that, and yes, we intervene and don't allow him to annoy people)--, but I think someone telling me my son is what made them decide that children aren't for them... I feel that's a bit too negative, wouldn't go as far as calling it an insult but I don't think I'd laugh about it.", "I remember when my sister Rebecca had a kid and our other sister Melissa said niece reaffirmed her childfree choice, it really hurt Rebecca's feeling.
