I personally found the comment harmless and would brush it off as a joke tbh so I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. I love my nephew with my whole heart but after spending a day with a small child it made me realize I couldn\u2019t be a parent. Maybe just explain to your sister you meant it as a light hearted joke and apologize because I\u2019m getting the sense you had no bad intentions", "NTA. I mean, it was insulting even if you intended it to be a joke.  However, it wasn\u2019t an insult toward your niece. It was an insult towards your sister and her boyfriend\u2019s shit parenting.

You haven\u2019t been responsible for them for an emergency overnight before, you suddenly saw first hand who tough it is and that maybe your not cut out of it.\n\nYou joked to your sister about a very serious issue that you think you\u2019re not cut out to me a parent. It was about you not her kids. Your mom is actually the one insulting the older child saying that if you could cops with the oldest you\u2019d be okay (implying something is off about the younger.", "NTA. I\u2019d prob laugh if I were your sister. Gonna assume she got offended cause she knows it\u2019s true lol\n\n I think other people\u2019s children will always be different than your own no matter how much time you spend with them. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily give up on the idea for one misbehaving kid but honestly your family seems uptight lol.", "NTA- it's an old joke- What's the best birth control?  Babysitting someone else's child.", "I'll go with NTA. Mom of two here. The eldest is mostly a well-behaved kid, quiet, nice, shy, artsy etc. Has her moments still but it is expected. Knows how to be loud and does but not all the time. \n\nNow my youngest is a menace. I'm half joking that if he was the first he would've been the only one. Rebellious, destructive, uncooperative. It's damn hard to not loose my mind on a constant basis. So I understand. \n\nThe difference between you/your partner and the parents is the connection they have with the kids. They have the experience and knowledge of how to deal with the good and the bad. It takes time. Babysitting is not the same as parenting no matter how much time you spend doing it. \n\nI can't tell you that having your own will be easy. Can't tell you that it will be hard cause my own kids are proof it can be both. What I do know, and keep in mind it's not true for everyone, is that once they are born you just level up. I acquired skills i never had. I had little to no interaction with babies before and suddenly i know how to hold a newborn, know how to dress them, how to change a diaper, know the difference between a hungry cry and a sleepy one etc. \n\nAnd know that not having children is as a good choice as having them. Not everyone is cut for it and not everyone is meant to be a parent.", "NTA - it's a joke and she's your sister. \n\nI'll bet her being offended after the fact is just  defensiveness for knowing what a handful her younger child is and not feeling like she's done enough to address it. \n\nMy younger sister has three kids and I love them all, but the youngest is absolutely exhausting. She has said herself that if he'd been the first born, he would have been an only child.", "NTA. If she took the joke poorly, she could have taken you aside and privately told you that it was not ok and that it hurts to hear that. Instead, she decided to go nuclear and involve the entire family behind your back.\n\nSome people communicate using sarcasm. I think what you did was meant as a good-hearted jab, not as an insult. But not everyone understands sarcasm and its use to show affection.\n\n>and my mother is on my case saying if we could cope with the eldest we\u2019d be ok as parents\u2026\n\nAnd this has become an excuse to attack your life choices. Great...", "NAH. You clearly didn't mean it as an insult, just as a \"wow, I didn't realise what *really* went into raising a child on a day to day basis, I don't think I have what it takes or if it's what I even want, but you guys and parents in general are superheroes\". Though I may be biased, as that's pretty much my thoughts exactly.\n\nHowever, I do understand how a parent could take it the wrong way and feel insulted, I've found that parents tend to take anything said about their children that could be construed as negative very personally. You could definitely have worded it better imo, it's wise to be careful with what you say about a person's kids.", "NAH.  Some parents would\u2019ve been fine with that joke, or acknowledged their kid *is* a bit of a handful no matter how much they love them.  But your sister\u2019s reaction is also understandable and valid.  So just apologize, tell her it definitely says more about you than your niece, etc.  (And do brace yourself for more commentary if the inclination not to have kids sticks, because it sounds like your family might have some asshole tendencies in terms of thinking they get to weigh in on that.)", "I feel like it's different when you have kids. I find other people's kids quite stressful to babysit and having them over for a week would be a nightmare. I do not find my kids equally stressful. So if someone said something like that to me - even though rationally I am aware of the possibility that other people might find my kids equally as stressful as I find theirs - I think I would still be quite upset at my kid being insulted that way. \n\nIt just sounds like a mean-spirited comment (even if that's not how you meant it to come across). You could've said that everything went well, but that you admire her because you just couldn't do it because kids can be a lot when they're in a mood or something like that, without letting her know that babysitting her kids made you change your mind about having a baby.\n\nThat's why I'm going with YTA", "NTA it gave you an insight of what responsibilities could happen since not every child is perfect. I even tell my own kid thank God I only have one child not two  you're driving me nuts I even tell my idiot thank God I'm not having kids with you. Because I have my own problems and he has his since the house isn't balanced it wouldn't be fair to bring another in for the miserable ride.", "ESH I think. Dropping a huge bomb like that (we've been thinking about having kids for nearly a year, but a week with yours was so tough we've changed our minds') and playing it off as a joke is a weird and kind of insulting thing to say.\n\nBut it sounds like your family are blowing it way out of proportion, and it's not really your Mum's place to decide whether or not you should have kids.", "Honestly, I kind of think YTA cause it wasn\u2019t really a \u201cjoke\u201d... you have actually decided not to have kids because you couldn\u2019t deal with specifically one of your nieces\u2019 behavior. Not certain where the joke is in that statement. \u201cYour kid is such a pain in the ass, we decided not to have kids\u201d hahaha... it\u2019s really not that funny. \n\nThis is like having dinner with a friend & as they were leaving they say \u201cThanks for the lovely meal. After tonight I\u2019ve decided to never get married because your husband is such an AH\u201d..... You & your husband may feel mildly insulted. \n\nEta", "I don't blame you for feeling that way. If you've changed your minds it's probably for the best. You know your limits but CHRIST, you're not supposed to verbalize to the parents of the children you babysat for, your own flesh and blood no less. You could have been honest about the behavior of the youngest without insulting her children. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt was an insulting comment.  You insulted her child, intentionally, and by extension its an insult to your sister.  You also have zero experience with children, you don't understand them, and have no frame of reference on if the child's behavior was better or worse than any other child that age and the many other factors that affect children that can cause them to act out.\n\nI agree you should not have children.

They love their kids but hate the actual job of being a parent and say that if they could go back they wouldn't have kids at all. Apparently that's like the worst thing in the world to say because women especially get lambasted for not thinking motherhood is the best thing since rice krispie treats but not everyone loves being a mom and some people down right shouldn't even have kids at all. Finding out before you have a kid that you definitely don't want that job is a blessing to you and to your future non-kids.  People are going to call you selfish and a kid hater and say it's your duty as a woman to have kids but stay strong. It's ok not to want and not to have kids.", "NTA. However, it might be a good idea to offer an apology if the mom\u2019s feelings were hurt to maintain the peace. Not everyone is cut out for parenthood. Kudos to you for figuring that out early enough, but still desiring to babysit. I had my kids later than most, and they are my sun and moon, but I knew I wasn\u2019t ready for that in my 20s. Everyone is different, and I paused when I saw that you watched very young children for a week so their parents could go on vacation without them. That is almost unheard of where I live. That\u2019s a big ask for non-parents and she should be very thankful for your support. \nI remember saying that my nieces and nephews were birth control for me (my siblings are several years older and I was an aunt at 12). \nYou didn\u2019t say anything with malicious intent, nevertheless, an apology is the easiest solution.", "NTA. It was a joke.", "NTA but just apologise", "NTA. I honestly saw it as a joke at your own expense not at your sister's or her kids. You had them for a week, saw what was involved in having kids full time and figured out it wasn't for you and even mentioned you didn't know how your sister did it, which meant you couldn't. \n\nSo if anything, you're pretty much saying you'd be incompetent as a full time parent while respecting her as one. But maybe she's experiencing the early signs of teenagedom on her kids as they push boundaries and got sensitive and thought it was a commentary on her parenting. I'd clarify if I was you that it wasn't a jab at her but at yourself.", "NTA", "NTA - Joke or not, she needs to know that her younger child needs some reigning in. A couple of separate things here though... \n\n1. how the kids act is a direct response of the parenting. If the kids are a handful, demanding, mean, messy, etc... it's because the parents allow that or enable it.\n\n2. dealing with your (although beloved) nieces would be literally nothing like dealing with your own kids. Your own kids will behave the way you raise them to be (for the most part - they will still test some limits as they learn). If you raise them to be polite, listen, respect, clean up after themselves, etc and reinforce that behavior, that is the kind of child you will have.\n\nSo, I wouldn't decide to have kids or not based on a child that isn't being properly parented. And no, you were not an AH for calling it out. Your sister needs to be told what needs to be corrected in her child behavior. A lot of times the older child has all the responsibility dumped on them and the younger one runs wild, because parents become lenient or do the whole \"aww she's young, she'll grow out of it\". No. That's not how parenting works lol", "Not really TA, no one is in my mind. You probably should apologize to your sister; you singled out your niece. You could have said something that the experience, made you rethink your own kids, but babysitting is fun cause you love her kids. You definitely insulted her by singling out the niece, I would have been insulted too. It is ok to not want kids, not ok to insult people.

OP, I was a teacher and I have children. Having children made me realize that anyone who isn't 100% wanting to have kids, shouldn't. We have a child who was very sick for a while. We have a child with some disabilities. I can't imagine many people who wanted kids more than me, or who has more experience with children, but it was still HARD. I used to really push my brother and his wife that they should have kids, but now I tell them to do what they want. Having kids 24/7 is SO different from babysitting, nannying, or teaching. I sometimes joke that hanging out with kids is a really good form of birth control. I don't mean that my kids, or other kids, are monsters, but having to put someone else's needs first 24/7 is hard.

Just because they are both parents to the same kids doesn\u2019t mean they parent each child the same way. If that were the case, there would be no neglected or golden children. Being under ten also doesn\u2019t excuse it as you just said yourself that the brother was well-behaved. \n\nThey are shit parents because they elected to have a child-free weekend without making sure that *both* of their children were well-behaved enough to stay with other people. That is shit parenting as it puts unnecessary stress on both children and the people keeping them.\n\nThe sister\u2019s reaction is telling.

The kid is *seven*. Seven year olds sometimes have strong emotions and don't manage them properly. Seven year olds sometimes cut up to test boundaries. It's not a sign of shitty parenting, it's a sign of a child acting childish. So parents aren't allowed a few days away from their kid if there's even a slight change that kid might misbehave? Teenagers test boundaries, saying that a seven year old misbehaving a little bit is a sign they aren't being raised right is a massive stretch.\n\nOP isn't TA, but telling someone \"being around your kid made me not want to have my own\" is rude if not worded carefully.", "I think it's just an age thing. It's not really a question of \"good behaviour\" or \"bad behaviour\", so much as \"children gonna child\". Over a *week*, yeah a kid's going to be get a bit overtired, or cold, or hangry. They're going to get cranky, that's just how their brains work. They still need a bit of help to self-regulate. \n\nA well-behaved child at that age won't do it much, and will pull out of the crank before it hits tantrum stage. If \"your kids didn't do that\"?

Also, she\u2019s seven, yes. Her brother is eight. I can\u2019t imagine that makes so much of a difference in regards to expectations. No where did I say parents don\u2019t deserve breaks. What I\u2019m saying is: If your child\u2019s behavior confirms for someone who works with children that they don\u2019t want kids of their own, you need to step back and reassess how your raising your child, not dump them on your brother and take a week long vacation.", "Here\u2019s the thing though. People are assuming when I say \u201cwell-behaved\u201d that the child is literally *perfect*. No one is perfect, so that assumption makes no sense.

Most people who spend considerable time with kids wouldn\u2019t be phased by that. But apparently, niece was wilding out to the point where he felt the need to joke about how watching her confirmed he didn\u2019t want to have kids. I don\u2019t think most people *with his experience* would say something like that if the niece wasn\u2019t acting outside the parameters of what is considered normal child behavior.", "I\u2019m 28. Your assumptions about my age and maturity level take away from whatever point it is you\u2019re trying to make. At no point, did I say kids can\u2019t mess up. If a kid is just messing up once or twice a week as you put it, I doubt OP would\u2019ve felt the need to comment on their behavior at all.", "Where do you get that?? There's no sign of particularly poor behaviour in the OP, it sounds to me like they were feeling a bit too much empathy, so it was distressing when the kid was upset. The relationship is different when it's over a week rather than a schoolday, and I think it caught OP off guard.", "I am sorry but YTA. Although you intended it as a joke (which is fine), you unintentionally did insult her though. Accountability is the acceptance of responsibility for one's own actions, and sometimes we unintentionally hurt others. Just apologise.\n\nIf you want to talk about her parenting habits , that can be addresed in a more gentle manner not through a \"joke\".", "Man. Honestly? A little bit of both. You really should have phrased that so much differently.", "Wording is everything with comments like these. You say in your post that ultimately you and your partner determined you wouldn\u2019t be cut out for parenthood after experiencing kids long-term.  \nHad you said \u201cwe realized we aren\u2019t cut out for this full time\u201d vs \u201cwe no longer want to be parents due to youngest\u201d, it would have focused that the situation was on you/your comfort/capabilities vs the kid\u2019s behavior (which may or may not be typical kid behavior, we don\u2019t know).  \n  \nNAH but more a miscommunication", "NAH.\n\nYou didn't mean to be mean, but I can see how it was taken that way. I think I'd be a bit stung if someone said the same to me. \n\nSo I'm not going to all-out call you an arsehole, but I do think it would be a good idea to apologise to all concerned and draw a line under the matter to keep the peace. Impact over intent, right?", "I think NAH except your mom. You made a joke, I get why you made it, and even in this post you're saying your nibling wasn't a monster, just more than you expected and changed your opinion. I'm wondering though, is it everyone in your family, or just your mom on your case bc you don't want kids? I'm thinking maybe your sister said something to your mom and she twisted it and is now pissy bc you changed your mind about kids.", "Nta", "NTA, I've felt similarly about family kids. I will say though as a new parent it is different when it is yours. Maybe the empathy from knowing why my kid is yelling/crying/etc makes is more bearable? I still don't like other kids, but I love mine!", "Lol NTA! You\u2019re sister must know how her youngest behaves for her to get mad at being called out.  You weren\u2019t insulting her kid or her.

Babysat my sisters eldest two (4,2) and afterwards he said he\u2019s good with just one. That he has no idea how my sister and BIL do it.  And they were well behaved just a LOT of energy.", "NTA my sister used to always joke with me that if I wanted kids to babysit hers for a few hours and see if I still felt the same", "NTA, but it's probably a good idea to apologize for hurting your sister's feelings especially if that wasn't your intention. Also, I think it's perfectly fine if you want to be child free but I will say that watching other people's children is not quite the same because we typically create the little monsters that we can deal with. Your children will behave the way you raise them to behave and you will have a tolerance for that because that is the environment that you created and is acceptable to you.", "Look. I have had many, many experiences with children of all ages and whatnot (worked with autistic children for a while, was in my teens when my very young siblings were needing watching ) and having knowledge of how kids are of all ages and whatever, I never wanted kids. I said this since I was 8 years old cause I hated babies. But no one believed me. My BF got a vasectomy recently and we have never be happier with our 1 puppy, 3 cats, and 3 bearded dragons. He owes me a kitten. So....your family sucks. You changed your mind and may so again but my family said I would change my mind too but I am happy with my pets. Won't have kids.

Babysitting is great birth control.", "NTA - my kids are awesome, but even awesome kids are a lot of work and have moments.

Most parents have a pretty good sense of humour about this.", "NTA, my cousin put me off the idea of having kids and that was just after witnessing one all-out tantrum while we were both being babysat by our grandparents. I can understand why the parent might be feeling sensitive about the comment (especially if they secretly wish they didn't have that responsibility sometimes but can't back out because that's how parenting works) but honestly I find that any parent who's aware enough of how hard parenting is has no reason to be upset by the comment, especially since it's not like you kept beating the dead horse/making constant comments about how awful her kid is. It was enough to make you think, that's all. It would be another thing entirely if you were like \"oh god thank fuck you came back for your kids because X was just *the worst,* I hate kids now\" because that's a bit much (and also presumably untrue).", "YTA", "YTA and owe the kid who most likely heard that and your sister an apology. It was a mindless, but extremely hurtful comment, esp if the child heard you say it. Would you like someone else to say thanks to your behavior they don't want kids?\n\nYou're utterly valid to feel that way. I do too and know I couldn't handle the sheer amount of time that goes into raising a kid. Cooking, cleaning and financially supporting a small human for 20 years is sheer exhaustion to me, but you don't name shame a kid to express not wanting any op.\n\nHug your niece and make up with your sister. Not wanting kids isn't her fault. And remember your milage with your own child will vary greatly from your experiences with someone else's kid. You may discover raising your own isnt too bad if you ever have one.", "NTA from my point of view it's just a joke.

Don't trash other people's kids, ever.\n\nIt's good you realized you are not cut out for being parents.  If more people took care of other's kids for a week or two, they would come to the same conclusion and there wouldn't be so many unhappy families.", "YTA -It is not a serious offence, but what you said was offensive to your sister. It is perfectly valid not wanting kids, especially after seeing what parenthood is kind of like first hand, but keep unkind thoughts to yourself. When you say something hurtful to someone, getting defensive and saying \"It was just a joke,\" sounds invalidating and does not take any accountability. It is much better to say, \"I'm sorry. I did not mean to hurt your feelings.\" Honestly, this is such a minor offense so make it right and move on. You're entitled to your opinions, but you also have to speak respectfully to people. In other words you told your sister \"Your kids were so bad I decided not to have any.\" Ouch. That was hurtful, even if you did not mean to hurt her. Words have power.", "NTA. As a mom of 3, of whom 2 are a little harder to handle, if anyone told me that I wouldn\u2019t be offended. I KNOW how they are, lol. But I\u2019m also a super easy going person in general.

The eldest was well-behaved and the youngest had some sass and... *checks notes* experienced negative emotions. Oh the horror.\n\nThat sounds like perfectly normal behaviour for a 7 year old. Bad parenting would be more like the kid was unruly, didn't listen, was demanding, broke things, was disobedient, said intentionally hurtful things, didn't accept boundaries, retaliated poorly when disciplined, etc. Having \"bad moments\" could mean any of these things, but there is nothing in the post to indicate that this kid was doing anything outside of normal 7 year old behaviour which, I hate to tell you, involves \"bad moments\" like not wanting to eat whats for dinner, missing mum while she's on holiday, struggling to settle down at bedtime for being overexcited.", "\"Some people are obsessed I called these parents who we have no information on shitty\", I wonder why that's the case lmao.

I've had children that I thought were perfectly well behaved, if a bit emotional, that other teachers really struggled with.  I've had kids other teachers were perfectly fine with that drove me up a wall.  Kids are hard.  7 and 8 are hard ages, because they're not quite at a more mature or aware age, like a fourth or fifth grader might be, but they're more independent than a preschooler or kindergartener.  \n\nThere is no misbehavior mentioned in the post, so we have no idea what OP's tolerance level is, nor does this opinion factor in the differences between working in a classroom vs. parenting.  It also doesn't factor what capacity OP worked in a school.  There's a big experience difference both in what age groups you work with, and what position.

OP blatantly states that she realizes she's not equipped to deal with small children having negative emotions because it was agitating. OP also states that raising a child or being around them long term is different than working with them at school, which should be obvious anyway.\n\nYou've decided that OP's decision was based on a child acting horribly and not on her and husband's own emotional maturity and capacity to recognize they don't have the patience to deal with a kid's emotions on a long term basis. They got a taste of parenting and decided it wasn't for them. It doesn't mean that the kids parents are raising them wrong.", "OP literally said that they realized they get agitated at children\u2019s negative emotions.\nEvery child has negative emotions! \n\nOP is very mature for realizing they\u2019re not equipped for being a parent.\nTheir sister is NOT a shitty parent just because their child had emotions that agitated OP!", "Directly from OP\u2019s post.

Sorry but if she can deal with working at a school and still wanting children. Then her niece must be the devil reincarnated to make her not EVER want kids in the span of a week. Also I have ADHD was diagnosed at 5 and I could still use manners and communicate. Yeah I had negative emotions but I wasn't taught to take them out on others. It's not hard AT ALL to teach kids that big emotions are hard and that they need to take a breath and work through it. Getting angry and loud won't help. I think it's like gentle parenting.
