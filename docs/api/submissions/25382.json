Not in this situation, but I would avoid doing that in the future.\n\nBased off the accommodations they chose this time around, they are fine with being frugal and simple and just enjoying a trip.\n\nIf you want further explanation it would be extremely annoying if every time they picked accommodations based off budgets they feel comfortable with, you came around and forced up cost on them.  They may stop wanting you to go altogether.\n\nIf they choose what they are comfortable with and it doesn't meet your expectations, it's not fair to make them spend more money just so you are happy.
