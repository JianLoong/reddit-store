We're on a much-needed getaway, but things have taken an unexpected turn.\n\nMy wife has always been a bit controlling and bossy, but it's been magnified during this trip. She's been extremely clingy, not letting our 16-year-old son out of her sight for even a moment. She's been acting like a helicopter parent, even though our son is a responsible teenager. \n\nYesterday, I lost my patience. We were all supposed to enjoy some time by the pool, but my wife kept intervening whenever our son tried to socialize or spend time with other teens. She would make passive-aggressive comments about how she didn't trust the other kids and that our son needed to stay with us. I finally snapped and told her that she was being overbearing and entitled, acting like a Karen who can't let go.\n\nThe argument that followed was intense. My wife accused me of not caring about our son's safety and said I was being insensitive to her concerns. I countered that our son is old enough to make some decisions on his own, and her constant monitoring was suffocating him. The fight escalated, and now we're barely talking to each other.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for snapping at my wife? I feel like her behavior is taking away from our vacation and causing unnecessary tension. But maybe I could have handled it better.

NTA.", "NTA, your wife needs to get her shit straightened out", "NTA\n\nI am sure your son was grateful that you stepped up and stopped his mom from acting like that. There isn't much he can do on a ship. Both my kids have gone on cruises with family during their teens and weren't tied down like that. They didn't get into any trouble and had a blast. Your wife needs to relax and enjoy the vacation.", "NTA  If he can't interact with peers, why bring him on the cruise? Sounds miserable!", "NTA OP, I\u2019ve seen two comments of yours so far and it really sounds like your wife has hindered your son and his growth by a LOT. Which really isn\u2019t okay, instead of giving him wings to be able to fly off eventually, she\u2019s clipping them. \n\nHer behaviour is going to affect him long-term, it\u2019s going to affect any relationship he\u2019s in, platonic or romantic. And it\u2019s going to affect any relationship she has with any potential partner he has in the future. She\u2019s far too overbearing and controlling. \n\nWhat is her end goal in her behaviours? That he never leaves home, never has any friends because none of them are good enough, never finding love because they\u2019re not good enough? Does she want him to be alone with just her forever? \n\nYour wife needs some serious help, but unfortunately she has to be the one to make the decision to get it. And she\u2019d have to stick to it.", "NTA. Your wife needs to face her actions before the consequences come at alarming pace. Your son is likely to get sick of this controlling behaviour and will leave her behind and then she will complain that she never sees him.\n\nI would sit her down now and calmly discuss the issues, letting it get to a point where you lose your patience is not good as it makes both parties defensive, so the point of the disagreement is missed.", "NTA - He\u2019s 16. Depending where you live, he can drive, work and even drink alcohol. She doesn\u2019t trust other kids? What about trusting your kid? If she goes on suffocating him him like this, you will lose him.", "I N F O: Have you ever addressed her treatment towards you son previously? How much has his growth as a person been stunted by her controlling behavior? Does he attend school or have friends?\n\n(Updating my response upon answers)\n\nNTA\n\nI'm glad to hear you have previously addressed this! You need to strongly intervene at this point then. Your wife has a serious anxiety problem, and it's causing her to harm your child. He isn't learning how to navigate the world. He isn't learning his strengths and weaknesses. He's not gaining self confidence by overcoming common social hurdles, and he's certainly not learning how to be assertive. He hasn't learned how to pick himself up and try again when he fails.\n\nShe is creating what she fears.\n\nIf he manages to escape to college, a lot of kids that have been crippled by their parents self destruct. They haven't learned to look out for themselves, nor regulate their social lives. They easily bend to peer pressure, because they've never had a chance to develop a spine. They try to make up for what they've been denied, and it can get bad.\n\nIt's possible he'll end up like my husband. He was kept isolated from school friends as well. He wasn't allowed to get a ride with them anywhere. He blindly followed the first girl that showed him any attention. His mom made him sign a \"contract\" to never see her while they paid for local college. He became lonely and, for a time, struggled with alcohol.\n\nOne day, a coworker invited him to join our social group. I became friends with him, and eventually asked him out. His mom and older sister initially loved me, but they didn't like losing control over him. Things got *bad.*\n\nMy husband has told me that if he never met me, he's not sure he'd still be walking the earth, if you catch my drift.\n\nCan you say with 100% certainty your son isn't struggling mentally? \n\nMy husband hasn't seen his family in 10+ years, and he is *thriving.* He is free to be the man I always knew was there. He originally thought he'd reconnect with his family, but once he started to heal, he realized they'd only cause further harm.\n\nPlease, don't do what his father did and stand by idly. He didn't have the fortitude to defend and protect his son, because it was easier to let his wife get her way. You need to make a stand. Your son deserves it, and so does your wife (and you of course). She needs help, so she can stop living in fear. She needs to find a way to have a healthy relationship with him so she doesn't push him away. I know it's a massive undertaking, but I have hope for you and your family. You can do it \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. But your wife needs a reality check, otherwise your son will resent her later in life.", "NTA. Get your son into therapy asap. There is only 2 years left to repair her damage. Separate if you have to.", "Maybe ask her to name her actual fears? Does she think he'll fall for an older/unsuitable woman/man? Fall overboard? Leave her nest empty?", "FWIW a family friend's 16 year old daughter was raped on a cruise by a worker on the ship. Some international BS made it where he got away completely free. Your wife is worried. YTA.", "I'm sure snapping at her instead of having a mature conversation about parenting tactics really helped the mood. \n\nESH you made a bad situation worse, congrats.", "NTA. I think instead of snapping you could have potentially approached it a bit smoother but I understand tensions run high and when you\u2019ve had enough, you\u2019ve had enough. I think this is a her problem and perhaps her even expressing her fears to her son and making sure he\u2019s actually listening and understanding might go a long way. Communication is so important in family relationships and if this isn\u2019t curved her son could want little to nothing to do with her in the long run for fear of being controlled or being pressured.", "Jesus dude you need therapy, definitely the asshole here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
