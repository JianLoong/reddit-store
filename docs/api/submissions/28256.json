I was told when I was born, my grandma saw my hair (Red) and begged my parent's to name me after my aunt. They agreed. From a young age, I was aware she favored me. It also caused my other cousins to resent me. I didn't like her favoritism towards me and just wanted to be treated normal. She would often say, you have red hair like your aunt or your aunt use to like art ( I'm not into art) and would encourage me to take it up. I refused and it would upset her. Your aunty liked her hair in this style. I complained to my parents and they said that I just bring her comfort. Whatever!\n\n\nMy 18th was two weeks ago and me and my friends planned to have a weekend road trip. My grandma disapproved and said my aunt would have done a party at home and I finally lost it and said that's because, I'm not her, stop trying to make me be your dead daughter, I'm sick off it! My grandma started crying and left the room. I immediately felt bad. I got yelled at by family for making my grandma cry and my dad was the only one who looked troubled and stuck up for me and told everyone to leave. My mother was upset with me and like everyone else, demanded I apologize to my grandma, but I refused. My dad told me not to worry about it, and just go enjoy my road trip, it should be settled down, by the time I get back. Except it hasn't, everyone still angry and my grandma hasn't spoken to me either.", "created_utc": 1696492586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170c431/aita_for_telling_my_grandmother_stop_trying_to/", "score": 9872, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are YOU.\n\nSounds like the family has gone the path of least resistance for years, and maybe sometimes that has been something you\u2019ve been ok with, but you do not need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nYour parents, and all that enabled your grandmother to postpone her healing in this way are the AHs.\n\nForge a path.

Children shouldn't be born with jobs and they saddled you with a huge one.

And after years of frustration of being compared to your deceased aunt, you finally lost it. Your dad, at least, has your back, and the rest of the family needs to realize that you have been putting up with this for 18 years.", "NTA. All 4 of my brothers are named after deceased family members. Never once in all their growing up years, did my patents allow anyone to try and force them into being some dead persons mini-me!  I get that Granny misses her daughter but 18 years of non stop crap is deeply disturbing.  \n\nIt's never going to end if you don't keep your foot firmly on the ground and tell the fam your sick of it.

It may take changing your name completely to get them to recognize and accept your individuality", "NTA what your grandma does is not even unhealthy for her but also was very unfair to you. Instead of your enableing her your family should encourage her to do therapy again instead of letting her use you as a substitue for her dead daughter. I\u2018m glad your dad is on your side. While I understand that you didn\u2018t mean to hurt your grandmother, you shouldn\u2018t suffer just so she can feel better.", "NTA. Good on your dad for having your back, but it should have been done ages ago.", " It's tough dealing with constant comparisons. NTA", "NTA - your grandma needs help", "Nta it's crazy that the adults around you are enabling this", "NTA, you are literally ovrr the age at which your aunt died. There is no \"she did this or that\" at this point, it is all parent fantasies and speculations, except she is not your parent. You need to sit down with your mum (and dad but it seems he is already on your page) and expain to her that she needs to help you be yourself, not someone else's fantasy. You need her to have your back in this.", "You are neither an emotional support animal or a clone of your aunt.  NTA", "NTA, your dad sounds like the best person in your family by the way. It seems that everyone has allowed your grandmother to behave the way she has all your life (possibly for the best of reasons, the lady after all was grieving a dead teenage daughter) without thinking for one second about the inevitable consequences. You are the one that is owed an apology, no one else", "NTA for feeling manipulated into being someone you aren't and for standing up for your individuality, but A for the delivery.\n\nThis is why I hate naming a child after another relative. Too many older relatives transfer personality traits on a young child.", "Of course you are NTA here. Grandma should've been in grief counseling decades ago. She clearly hasn't processed, accepted and moved on from the death of her daughter and instead used you as a \"replacement\" so she could keep avoiding her grief. \n\nYou know who is TA? Everyone who isn't your dad. The reason why they are upset about what you said to your grandmother is because now they have to deal with an emotionally shattered, bereaved Grandma instead of just letting you be her emotional support child. They've let this go on for as long as it has because it's easier on them. \n\nNone of these people have your best interest at heart and only care about getting Grandma to stop crying, which is the goddamn problem. She's never dealt with this, she's been placated and pacified this entire time so she's never had to. It's past time this happens, GRANDMA NEEDS TO CRY. It's normal, your family needs to let her feel her damn feelings or she's never crawling out of this hole.\n\nTake your grandmother not speaking to you as a win, both for your mental health and her grief process. There's really no way for you to be around her right now; she won't start healing if your very presence is a crutch to keep her from doing that and she won't learn to let you be your own person if she doesn't start grieving properly.\n\nHonestly, you're 18, it might be time for a name change. You deserve to be your own person, not a replacement person for an aunt that died. Start setting boundaries, mainly that no one can ever compare you to your late aunt ever again. I'm so sorry this is happening, it's not unhealthy and unacceptable.", "You're NTA, but indo feel for your grandma. Losing a child is an impossible thing to wrap your head around. But, it's been 20 years. The fact that she is still grieving this hard is worrisome. It sounds like your dad is on your side, so he would probably be the best to talk to first. Your grandmother needs grief counseling. She needs to be able to let go and allow her daughter to RIP and enjoy and get to know the granddaughter she has. \n\nYou don't owe her an apology. It really doesn't matter. The reason behind it is that your grandmother has repeatedly crossed a (kind of creepy) line, repeatedly. However, again, anyone should be able to understand that the grief a parent has because of burying a child is almost impossible to comprehend. Unless you want to go NC, you should say something. \n\nBy no means do you really have to apologize. You may have been mean, but sometimes people need to hear the mean in order to stop. That being said, you could say something along the lines of...\n\n\"Grandma, I am very sorry I hurt your feelings. I did not want to make you cry. But I honestly can not handle this anymore. I have been very aware mynentire life how you have not only favored me, but you have pushed hard to turn me into a clone of your daughter. That's made me uncomfortable my entire life. It also breaks my heart. I feel like you are trying to use me to fill a hole in your heart. I'm sorry she is no longer here, I'm sorry I never got to meet her. But I am not her. I can not be her. I am my I n person, and I am trying very hard to be me and not her. It breaks my heart because it feels like you don't want to know me or get to know me for who I am. You have gotten upset so many times because I haven't done what she would do, liked what she liked, and been good at what she was good at. You have gotten upset at me for not walking in her exact footsteps. That's not fair to me.or her. I love you, I wish my existence could take that pain away from you. But it can't because I am not her and will never be her. Would she really want you to try and make me her? Or would she want you to get to know the grandchild you have? Please, get to know ME, love ME because I'm ME, and not because I remind you of her. It really hurts to simultaneously be loved and non existant to someone that I love. Please, I want you to get to know who I am, I think you would be just as proud.\" And then give her a hug.\n\nThos puts the ball in her court. She can either make the effort to get to know who for you are or not. It may take a little while for her to actually move on, but you should be able to see the effort to get pretty immediately. I will say again that it really sounds like she is long overdue for grief counseling. If your parents agree (they don't have to be a united front is easier) that counseling would be beneficial, say something about you wanting her to go, maybe even go with her a couple times. \n\nYou're NTA, but I can't really say your grandmother is one either. She went through something that breaks people, so it's understandable that she struggles. She needs firm support to move forward. \n\nYou also need to talk to your mom at least. You need to tell her that you're hurt that she isn't supporting you. Again, you are you, not your dead aunt. And you need her help to make that clear in the least painful way to your grandmother. You may be 18 now, but you still need both your parents. And you need them both to help you step out of the shadow of a ghost and be seen for the living person you are. This is just a sad situation all around, and I'm sorry for the loss and how that's impacted you. I hope you're able to find a way to work through this in a healthy manner and to help your grandmother do the same.", "NTA - your entire family, including your parents ( little late for dad to step in now) allowed her to turn you into a touchstone for her dead daughter \n\nShe made your cousins resent you \n\nShe treated you as a second chance with her daughter rather than the person you are and everyone allowed it \n\nShe never processed her grief and your family failed both you and her", "NTA.... unfortunately this is a case of extreme grief that blew up. You are your own person who has their own likes and things you enjoy. And you aren't fitting onto the pedestal that Grandma placed you on when she saw your hair. \n\nFrankly Grandma may never get over it if she doesn't get help. And you can't make her start talking to you. As an adult of 18 I'd plow through this. Treat Grandma like you did before this all blew up. Don't respond when she makes comments about what your Aunt liked. I'd talk to the sibling of said Aunt and see about getting Grandma some much needed therapy.", "NTA and even the delivery was deserved. Your aunt is dead. You are not her or her replacement and someone needed to say it out loud.", "NTA. Well done.  Hanging on to a dead woman for decades isn't healthy. Your parents really shouldn't have let you be named after the dead daughter, but maybe they can speak to her for you. Your father seems to be in your corner. Perhaps you can speak to them seriously (is she his mother?)", "NTA\n\nI think there needs to be separate conversations if you want your gran in your life (which is your choice). 1st with your mum asking what she expected to happen when she named you after her dead sister at her mother's request, and asking her if she has ever challenged the constant comparison. 2nd with your gran, yes it could have been handled better, but that's already done: Let her know how much she is upsetting you and that if it continues she will have lost a niece as well as a daughter. It sounds like your gran doesn't know you very well, so you could say \"I know I remind you of X, who liked art, but I am different and I enjoy [hobby], would you like to watch me/join me/try it together?\" 3rd with your dad explaining you appreciated his backup in a difficult situation.", "I'd take Gramma not speaking to me as a win.

And also now with your Gramma. \n\nAnd finally you snapped and now all the people who supported that frankly shitty decision being made over and over are mad because now Gramma is upset.   The only one they should be upset with is themselves as they created this mess. \n\nYour dad understands and I suspect has been told more than once by your mother and her relatives that it would be okay, nobody was being hurt by it and to butt out.  Yeah well now Gramma is hurt and you feel guilty for something you didn\u2019t do nor could you control.  \n\nThe relatives will get over it and quite honestly they are the ones who should apologized to your gramma for allowing things to go on this long.  And to you for shoving you into a role you had no business being in.", "I'm guessing she's your maternal grandmother, and your mother sucks for enabling this. Stick with your dad.

It is terribly sad what happened to your aunt but that is not your burden to bare and not your responsibility to 'replace' her. You are your own person - good luck OP!", "Nta. Grandma needs therapy to move on from the loss of her daughter that sounds like it happened at least 20 years ago or more. It\u2019s not ok and someone should have called her out a long time ago when things started cropping up. (This is a prime example of why I think it\u2019s bad to name children after relatives who have passed when people are still upset over it. I actually know two families who lost a child (each family lost a child at a different time) and then named the new child one off. Think deceased child: Billy and \u201cnew\u201d child Bill. It\u2019s obvious what the parents did. One family gave birth to a new child to literally replace the other. The other family signed up to foster adopt within a month or two of the loss and only wanted little boys to adopt. When the adoption went through\u2026they changed his name to \u201cmatch\u201d the son they lost. It\u2019s not ok. You deserve your own identity.", "NTA.  Someone should have stepped in long before it came to this.  The lesson learned here, though, is for you to push back earlier when you can still be firm but gentle, rather than wait for it to get to a breaking point, where your response was more exasperated and frustrated than it was gentle.  But that honestly is more on your mom than it is on you.", "Did you ever actually tell your grandmother how you felt? It says you refused to take up art but did you tell her you didn\u2019t like being treated like your late aunt? Because honestly for me that\u2019s what decides whether someone is an AH for blowing up. Whether they directly talked to the person who\u2019s bothering them, or just complained about them to someone else. You\u2019re not an AH for feeling the way you do, but you need to communicate appropriately and with some semblance of tact (especially in a delicate situation like this one).", "In my family it's a huge tradition to name the younger generation after the previous ones (esp aunts and uncles, even great-aunts and uncles) but everyone goes by a nickname that is different for example the two Elizabeth's are called Elsa and Betty respectively. I don't like my first name so at around 18 I chose a new nickname that only resembles my name if you have a lot of imagination, but they got used to it.\n\nMy advice: be a rebellious teenager, choose a new nickname you want to go by and dye your hair. It's what teens do. You can still change it back it it doesn't work for you or you can choose something else.

I was told when I was born, my grandma saw my hair (Red) and begged my parent's to name me after my aunt. They agreed. From a young age, I was aware she favored me. It also caused my other cousins to resent me. I didn't like her favoritism towards me and just wanted to be treated normal. She would often say, you have red hair like your aunt or your aunt use to like art ( I'm not into art) and would encourage me to take it up. I refused and it would upset her. Your aunty liked her hair in this style. I complained to my parents and they said that I just bring her comfort. Whatever!\n\n\nMy 18th was two weeks ago and me and my friends planned to have a weekend road trip. My grandma disapproved and said my aunt would have done a party at home and I finally lost it and said that's because, I'm not her, stop trying to make me be your dead daughter, I'm sick off it! My grandma started crying and left the room. I immediately felt bad. I got yelled at by family for making my grandma cry and my dad was the only one who looked troubled and stuck up for me and told everyone to leave. My mother was upset with me and like everyone else, demanded I apologize to my grandma, but I refused. My dad told me not to worry about it, and just go enjoy my road trip, it should be settled down, by the time I get back. Except it hasn't, everyone still angry and my grandma hasn't spoken to me either.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If that's our go-to in a situation where it appears no one has even attempted a real conversation then it's unlikely our behavior is going to produce healthy relationships elsewhere. The cycle will just repeat over and over when any kind of difficulty arises, festers, and isn't addressed in a given relationship."]}
