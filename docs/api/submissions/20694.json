Especially since she still has it. Hopefully you have pictures/proof they are from your mother - but even if not, a police report is essential!", "NTA. Report her stealing ass to the police. Did you save the video evidence to the cloud? It'd make it easier to charge her with theft.", "Why are you even contemplating letting him back? file a police report and get the jewelry back. You have proof on the security cameras. (Why did he take them Down? Put them back up) He is putting his mother before you and always will. He has shown you who he is - listen. NTA\nEdit for spelling and vote", "NTA please file charges on you MIL as soon as possible! Try to remember dates and get the footage and when she wore the necklace. Once that is done you honestly need to consider divorcing your husband. He let his mother steal from you, tried to hide the evidence and embarrassed you. That is not a good man", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t you call police?", "NTA. You may want to consider a timeline before filing charges. At least for the jewelry and things that have sentimental value. Give them perhaps 1 week before you file theft charges. Honestly I'd file the charges now before they pawn them off and the shops sell the items, or if already pawned hopefully the shops haven't put them into circulation yet so you can retrieve them. I'd also scan through craigslist/Facebook/other platforms to make sure they haven't offloaded them that way either. Again, having charges filed will most likely return them to you if you find proof they were sold and reach out to the buyer to recover your items. Unfortunately your husband is part of the theft and any pawning/sales done, even if he wasn't directly involved, because he knew his mother had taken the things, chose to say it wasn't a big deal, and failed to make her return the items thus he condoned the theft. This is divorce worthy in my eyes, because he has broken a trust that likely can never be rebuilt.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTake the footage and report the theft.\n\nList down everything that is lost and get the police to do a search at her place.\n\nWtf. Your hubby is an enabler for a thief in your own place. You should see if more things are missing apart from your jewellery.", "NTA. NO FUCKING WAY would i ever allow that woman into my home again. And if you're smart you'll take that footage to the cops and file a police report now", "You are NTA.  Your husband is, though.  I think you did the right thing setting the expectation of what needs to happen to make this right, though I question once it \"resolves\" what is the path forward?  \n\nHow can you trust a husband that takes his Mom's side in this when she is stealing from you? Especially jewelry with a significant sentimental value to you.  He is not seeing you at all in this situation.  He took down the security cameras - I think this tells you everything you need to know about him and his mommy.  Keep that door locked.", "Hell no NTA. Good for you! Most people wait far too long to kick deadbeats out. Good on you for being proactive", "NTA. I stand in awe... Good work, op.", "NTA but the correct move when you saw her wearing it would be to take a picture, report EVERYTHING stolen to the police and hand over the pic and the footage from the security cameras.\n\nThis relationship is done and you're likely not getting any of it back without police involvement.
