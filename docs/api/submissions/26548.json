Makes no sense for him to turn around and say \"none of your business\" when you question him on it.", "If he doesn't want you to question his financial situation, he should stop bringing up the subject so often. I'd also have wondered if I were you, maybe he's too spoiled and considers himself poor by never being satisfied ? We won't know, but that's what comes to mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nyou believe he is lying. You have valid reasons to believe he is lying. You are justified in asking if he is lying.", "NTA why does he keep saying he's poor?", "NTA. But you could still be a better friend.\n\nHe has real reasons to have security concerns, being from a wealthy family and living abroad. He also may well be trying to fit in to American culture, which is more egalitarian than Chinese, in my experience. There may also be a language gap where he's intending to say something less strong than he is saying.\n\nTry to speak to him privately next time. It is helpful for him to know how he's seen: that's hard in a foreign culture and language. But maybe you could have shared that more politely!", "NTA this is actually a trend many of them have to role play like they\u2019re somehow poor but it\u2019s far from it, good in you for calling his bs out.", "Perhaps moderate wealth is seen as poor in china, when it comes to international students standards. Lexus suvs are nice but the international students that are really rich wear designer but also have supercars like lamborghinis lol. To some of those students, 20,000 is monthly pocket change", "Why not just ask him why he says he's poor?", "YTA. I work at a university with a high percentage of Chinese international students. Because of the one child policy and various aspects of Chinese culture involving parent-child relationships and family reputation, it often turns out that families will spend the majority of their income and savings sending their one child to school and buying them everything they need to fit in. His family could literally be bankrupting themselves so your friend can get a degree that will set him up to take care of them. Bottom line is that you don\u2019t actually know anything about your friend\u2019s financial situation. It also sounds like you probably don\u2019t know a lot of about how incomes work in china (and that\u2019s not a dig\u2014why would you if you\u2019re not from there and haven\u2019t been exposed to the knowledge). Combined, it seems wise to take your friend at face value and not make assumptions you can\u2019t prove.", "INFO in what context is he bringing up that he is poor. Is it when people ask him to somewhere or to buy something?\n\n Just because his parents may be rich, doesn't mean he is rich. My sons are only as rich as the money THEY make. They can't count my money as their money even if I pay for thing for them. His parents may own the car he drives, so even thou it's a Lexus, he didn't pay for it and doesn't own it. He isn't paying for college, his parents are paying for college. THEY are rich but until they die and leave him their money, he is only as rich as the amount of money he makes. So he may well be very poor.", "ESH. He should not be crying \"poor mouth\" when he clearly lives a comfortable life. You are out of line for doing this publicly.\n\nWhy couldn't you approach him quietly, just one-on-one, and explain why his statements and his lifestyle conflict?\n\nWhile you are technically \"correct\" you are wrong for calling him out in front of other people.\n\nI hope all of you grow up a lot more.", "ESH.  People whose talk about how much money they have or how much money other people have are AHs.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH. Him for repeatedly bringing it up and potentially lying, but also you because it really isn\u2019t your business. There are more important things in friendships than money.\n\nETA: assuming no mooching is going on, of course", "ESH.  But I think ESH on accident.  You made an assumption, it turned out to be wrong.  He's from a culture where being prideful of one's status is frowned upon, so he was probably just being humble.  So we just have a big misunderstanding here.  Shake hands, dust off, and move on.", "hes right it isnt your business. now i dont know the context of the conversation and what led him to say hes poor or whatever, but unless you know for a fact hes getting something out of him saying it leave the man be. being wealthy can make you a target for people that only want to know you for the perks that come with it. IMO you are 100% an asshole. even if the man is rich, hes not advertising it, and assuming hes not scamming people who think hes poor. leave it alone.\nYTA", "YTA and it really isn't your business.  He probably wants to be liked for himself and not his money.", "Elvis the pelvis was fine until his brother Enis was born. I\u2019m dead - no NTA.", "Oh, NTA, and it's your business as soon as he puts it out there.", "YTA. If he's wealthy and says he's poor it's because he doesn't want to attract freeloaders to himself.

He might be self conscious about coming from wealth and doesn't want to be used for money but it's still not okay to lie about it, he should just avoid bringing it up if anything. A good friend is supposed to call you out in a constructive manner when you do things like that.", "NTA but it's murky territory.

That said, when they play the poor card as though it was some ace up the sleeve\u2014and the sleeve is Versace\u2014I cannot criticize you too hard for calling out the dissonance that your friend shoved in your face.", "NTA. I have a friend just like this- complains about being poor but travels internationally multiple times a year. He's just cosplaying as broke to be relatable.", "NTA but chances are he is being \u201cI\u2019m poor compared to my family\u2019s rich friends.\u201d But yeah, he isn\u2019t poor", "If he indeed has 20k+ USD in stocks I'd just straight up laugh in his face.

In Taiwan I've been asked my income when I'm just meeting people so many times, it's funny.", "I think probably to fit in more or so people don\u2019t try to befriend him for money", "> situation.

Thanks for sharing.", "Info: did you grow up in China, or were you raised in a different environment/culture/country?", "Are you from china? If you are, then presumably you know more than me. But that still doesn\u2019t mean you know anything about his family\u2019s financial situation. Unless he\u2019s constantly asking you to pay for things or loan him money, it\u2019s not really any of your business.", "Just anecdotal evidence based on where I live and the Chinese people I know here.  Didn't intend for that to be a sweeping statement.", "Yeah, it\u2019s honestly kind of funny he thinks people would believe him when he drives around in a huge Lexus SUV", "Might be that his immediate family is poor and he's being funded by a richer relative.\n\nAlso, call me slightly cynical, but being \"in construction\" while having that much money brings to mind \"Uncle Tony who has a thriving New York City concrete concern\".", "Except it's Uncle Chang who has a thriving Shanghai concrete concern. \n\nIf Lexus is the low end on his family's car scale he may still be poor.
