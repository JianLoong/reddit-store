Of course I said yes, because I wouldn\u2019t mind helping getting their name out there, so I advertised their products a few times.\n\nNow whenever they get new products to sell, they pester me to advertise their new things and constantly remind me when I forget. They said they already have social media pages for their business but they want me to advertise since I have a lot of customers on my social media. I don\u2019t want to do it every day and all the time because it gets annoying and it interferes/clashes with my business since we\u2019re selling completely different things. I even gave them advice on how and where to sell. \n\nI want their businesses to grow, but I don\u2019t want this to interfere with my own business.

Something you could consider is creating a \"friends of the bakery\" section on your pages or time per month when you promote a variety of friends' and families' businesses, with links to their pages instead of promoting specific products or services. Or there might be other creative ways that would work for your business to help other small businesses while not sacrificing your brand and marketing niche. All the best, keep up your great efforts!", "NTA. The businesses aren't in competition, but I also don't subscribe to food content creators to be sold hair accessories. One post to about your sister's business was supportive and polite. Many posts can damage your OWN brand. You are not her free advertising department.", "NTA, and this will be the fastest way to tank your social media. Ppl are there for bakery items, not hair", "NTA\n\nYou are a bakery business, your followers on there are interested in your baked products, not accessories, you may have a lot of followers on your socials, but they are NOT your sisters target consumers.", "NTA. One announcement of \u201cthis store opened, go check it out!\u201d Was more than kind of you. Advertising every time a new product comes out is what they should be doing on their own pages, not yours. Just keep your bakery business strong :)", "NTA To be honest, I'd be confused if I went a website for a bakery and it was flogging hair accessories. Your sisters need to stop trying to capitalize on the success of your business. What next, you offering their products for sale at your cash register? You've given them both advice how to effectively advertise their products, it's up to them to build their businesses and not to continue to try to piggy back on your success.", "They should follow your advice instead of taking advantage of you. It'd be different if they were trying to develope their one social media and ask you every now and then to give them a little push. Harassing every day affecting your business since it's confusing your target, is wrong and you have to draw the line. NTA", "NTA. It was kind of you to share her content at all, now she is overstepping.", "WNBTA. You aren\u2019t an advertising agency.", "NTA. You were kind enough to do it initially. You have a bakery account and people want to see your baking goods not hair clips. They are just taking liberty.", "NTA. Your customers follow **you** on social media. You already helped them out and did some advertising, but your customers might care jack all about whatever your sisters are doing. People on social media are fickle. If you pester them with enough content they don't care about, they'll stop following.", "NTA.  Your business isn't a great fit along with theirs.  Frankly, they don't go together at all.  You've done enough.", "NTA. Your businesses are extremely different and at different levels, so advertising constantly for them to your customer base might have the unintended consequence of delegitimizing your business in your potential customers' eyes.  Not saying it WILL happen, but it is a valid reason not to want to do it too often.", "Info: Do they post about your business on their business\u2019s social media to?", "NTA  \nYou arent obligated to post every new product they have, on your website. Having promoted them to begin with and liking their products is plenty. They are capable of doing their own social media advertising without pestering you to do it for them.", "Nta a favor is a favor. Doing it constantly constitutes you doing a job. Where you get zero benefits and it might dilute you\u2019re brand. You taught them how to do it so it\u2019s time they do it", "Obvious NTA, your sisters are just leeching of your business for advertising. They shouldn\u2019t be asking you to do all their ads when a new product releases in their businesses. \n\nEdit: You can still help and support your sisters businesses, though, but you should make them more independent in their advertising", "NTA\n\nI agree with you in that there is no way to reasonably promote hair related things within a bakery site.  This assumes you don\u2019t have other unrelated sites you promote. \n\nYour sisters would likely be better served to find related businesses that they could cross promote with.", "YWNBTA\n\nIt was generous of you to offer help early on, but you're right promoting their products through your marketing outlets undermines the effectiveness of your advertising, and could even hurt your business.  I don't know anything about your client base, but it doesn't seem like bakery customers would necessarily be a target audience for hair accessories anyway.  It would be better for THEM if they stopped using you and sought their actual target demographic.", "NTA, its not personal its business and they probably need to understand that if they are running their own business. \nHonestly, If I was following a bakery page and started seeing posts about hair accessories I would think it's spam and stay away from everything on the page \ud83d\ude05", " NTA if they want advertising they should pay for it like anyone else", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d unfollow a bakery social media account if it started sharing lots of posts about completely unrelated items. If there was a correlation and you wouldn\u2019t lose followers, that would be one thing. But they\u2019re asking you to risk alienating followers with unrelated content.\n\nIf you felt so inclined, you could run a poll in stories (depending on platform) and ask your followers if they\u2019d like to learn more about their businesses. Whatever the result, go from there.", "NTA, but...as a bakery, maybe you get some clients for kids parties? That would be a case that you could mention the hair accessories buisness? Maybe find those few instances that you and your sisters may overlap, and help out each other! But only if it happens organically, and makes sense with the clientele. \n\nNow I want a cupcake.

They can put the effort in that you did rather than just trying to ride on your coattails. It will eventually negatively effect your business and relationship with them, people want to see your baking products, not hair clips", "Do they advertise your business?", "NTA. You're not an advertising agency. I agree with others in the comments that advertising every time your sisters have a new product could damage your brand/social media.

You can do favors for people if you want, but when it takes bread off your table, it needs to come full stop.

Do they reciprocate and advertise your bakery on their website? If so, how often? I imagine that even if they do, you are not bringing new items to your inventory as often as they are, so there would be less work involved. You put their business on your website to help them get started. They are now up and running.

It's time to set them.", "There's a way to promote each other without affecting your marketing (I have a business too, and this is what I do in order to get more followers and get known):\n\n(In case of using Instagram or Facebook) Choose one product from your sisters, post a foto indicating it's the prize of a ruffle. Tell your target that in order to participate they have to tag ten friends who likes bakery products. Tell them you'll reveal the winner in a week.\nDuring that week, people who want your sisters chosen product, will tag friends who likes your product. Win-win marketing strategy. One a mont or two months is ideal. \nIf you do this too many times is also no good cause people get confused and/or bored.", "Ok then NTA \n\nTell them if they keep insisting that they need to do a tit-for-tat.

This is a classic example of the \u201cfoot in the door\u201d technique which is a compliance tactic where someone asks for small favors and increasingly asks for more and more after you comply to each prior request. I think it\u2019s fine when they first asked you since you were comfortable with it, but them beginning to expect advertising goes beyond the initial favor you did for them. You\u2019re not obligated to do anything since it\u2019s YOUR business that you worked hard to build. They\u2019re going to have to learn that they can\u2019t just piggyback off of your hard work to get them higher on the business totem pole", "I would support them on my personal social media but never my business, because its not even the same products as yours so you could lose followers, as others have mentioned\u2026 Best wishes", "NTA you\u2019re not obligated to post hair accessories (and posting that on your business account would seem unprofessional in my opinion)", "NTA, they're riding your coat tails because you're allowing it!

Now my brain is going 'cake in my hair, hair in my cake, haircake'.", "At this point, any of your customers who follow you regularly on social media and are interested in hair accessories are aware of your sister\u2019s business. All constantly bringing up her stuff will do is annoy people who don\u2019t care about hair accessories. Maybe once a month you could do a post with both of you that says something like \u201chey, Mother\u2019s Day is coming up, why not spoil mom with XYZ from my biz and ABC from my sis!!\u201d If you feel like it.

Tell them you can't promote them anymore because you are losing subscribers.  People who want to know about bakery products don't want hair ads.  They are just going to have to build up their presence themselves the way you did.  I'd also mention that you're sure they don't want you to damage your business for their sakes  any more than you already have.", "NTA. I don't go to a bakery to get sold hair accessories.", "Very clever idea! \n\nHowever, OP, I would make it very clear (if I was in your situation) that anyone who rudely attacks me instead of being appreciative for what I was willing to do will get nothing more.", "Yeah if they were not related - like I could see liking a post about a bakery selling its cookies at a bookfair or partnering with a restaurant for thanksgiving. But hair clips? That would seem weird.\n\nThe friends of the bakery section supporting small businesses idea I like (it\u2019s top post now) and think that\u2019s a great way to get around it and also limit how much you\u2019re posting", "No, don't do this.
