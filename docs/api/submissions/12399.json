As everyone has been pointing out, you don\u2019t want to be selling a bunch of weirdly unrelated things. Even worse, think of the association- do you really want people thinking about hair in relation to any food you are making?

Is it called LillaRose or Paparazzi by chance, or do your sisters make thier own products by hand? If they don't, you should be investigating.\n\nEven if they haven't fallen prey to a scammy MLM, it would be good for you to get familiar with them anyway, because as your business grows, you will almost certainly get folks who purvey MLM goods asking you to advertise for them/give them shop space or asking for other favors. \n\nThey often try to guilt legitimate business owners, especially women, for favors by saying things like \"you should help a fellow small business owner succeed like you succeeded\" (even though they are not business owners at all). Knowing about them ahead of time may be helpful, especially if family of friends are the one asking.\n\nMost successful small businesses just have a blanket ban on doing any sort of business with MLMs, and that's really the best thing you can do.\n\nI'm sure you saw how many comments said they'd be annoyed if thier bakery social media subscriptions suddenly had ads for hair accessories- that annoyance skyrockets for ads for an MLM.\n\nI posted in my other comment, but a great resource on all things MLM is a lovely and informative YouTuber lady named Illuminaughtii.", " \nThey will have to hire a marketing manager or you will have to pay for what they are asking for.", "I'm a gal, and hard same.

I've unfollowed some recently because they've started to just repost other people's content, or are no longer posting about their pets. **If you're not posting about the stuff I followed you for, then what are you doing on my feed?** So yeah, OP needs to consider her own social media following. People are following for pictures of cakes or bread or whatever, not hair accessories. Absolutely NTA.", "It's such a jarring switch that it's impossible not to notice too.\n\nLike if I follow a confectionary bakery and I start seeing posts promoting another savoury bakery, or a to-order cake service? I probably wouldn't even notice that change or if I did, it wouldn't bother me.\n\nBut as soon as I saw a post advertising hair accessories, I would be so confused why I'm seeing that. Immediately I'd check on the page and get rid of it.", "Don't do that. It isn't \"tit for tat\" at all, because you have much more to lose when people get annoyed and unfollow you.\n\nI also kinda strongly smell an MLM from your sisters- a multi level marketing scheme. Do your sisters sell something they handmade? If it's not... if these hair things are mass-produced and from a large company... it's likely an MLM.\n\nIf it is an MLM, advertising for them WILL harm your business, because there are a lot of folks who are anti-mlm, like me, because they are highly predatory. Any small business like yours- selling a product you make- is a place I love to support, unless I find out they support and advertise for MLM products like MaryKay, BeachBody, Scentsy or any other ones (there are hundreds). I'd stop supporting that small business immediately, because I feel even if the owner themselves isn't involved, just advertising for a friend involved in an MLM shows poor judgment.\n\nPlease make sure what your sisters sell isn't an MLM before you even consider putting your name near thiers. Even if it's not, though, you still have more to lose. Be very careful about what you support, your social media existence took a lot of work and time to build, and it's easy to drive customers away, so don't feel the slightest bit bad for being picky and careful about what you post, say or support- it's your livelihood, nobody else's!\n\nPopular MLMs that I know of that sell hair accessories are Lilla Rose and Paparazzi, but there are others as well. If you are not familiar with MLMs and how/why they are predatory and unethical, I suggest a YouTuber named Illuminaughtii- Her name is Blair, and she is a lovely woman who covers every major MLM. I suggest getting familiar with them, because if your own business keeps growing, there will likely be more asks for ads by your business by other folks who sell MLM products.", "I wouldn\u2019t do that honestly. It doesn\u2019t make sense for your brand at all. It\u2019s one thing to want to help your sisters, but you shouldn\u2019t do it at the expense of your business", "Thank you soooo much for this! I was aware of these MLM but didn\u2019t know how bad they were. Thankfully my sisters just get their hair accessories from a local wholesaler and everything is unbranded. So I don\u2019t think its an MLM", "Hmm.. good point though. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go into it then", "I have 3 sisters. I get it. You want them to succeed. If your sisters are decent people they will understand. If they are boundary stompers they might not. But if you value your business you need to be ok saying no. Good luck!:)"]}
