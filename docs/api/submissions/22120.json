If you don't keep contact with ex's then don't start relationships with people from your friend group. \nIn future either avoid starting relationships with members of your friend group or let them know your rules so they can decide whether they would prefer the friend group or a relationship with you.", "YTA. \n\nI think it\u2019s a crappy thing to do to establish the boundary that \u201chey you can\u2019t be in my house\u201d and then on a night when you\u2019re both out with your friend group, saying \u201clet\u2019s head back to mine\u201d, knowing she can\u2019t come. If you invited everyone to yours at the start of the night I\u2019d feel differently, but it sounds like you all had plans together and then you made a decision that excluded her from participating in the rest of the socializing for the night.", "Have personal experience in a kinda similar situation. If this were really your close friends first and mostl, accepted her when you two got together then NTA. You seemed to have handled the situation rather maturely from the description in the post so far and this seems to have been a regular thing before you two broke up (the small home parties at your place). Honestly those people sound more like your inner circle and support system (after all they all ditched her in a heart beat at this occasion, no one spoke up for her when you voiced the idea and everyone was fine with it), she should have pulled away for a while after she broke up with you, out of respect for you. Ofc excluding her is a bit of a dick move but she naturally should have kept more distance to you after the break up.", "YTA. It would be OK to invite your friends to your house and exclude your ex if you were not already all hanging out together. But because you were essentially taking an existing party and moving it, and leaving her behind, that makes it a dick move.", "YTA. You said at the start of your post that you met through a shared friend group. This means you all knew each other before, and she was a part of this group before she started dating you. \n\nAfter the break up, you said you were fine still hanging out as a group but didn't want her at your house. When planning a weekend out with everyone, you suggest to have it at your place, where you KNOW you have told your ex she is not welcome. So when you made the suggestion for the group to go to your house, you were deliberately excluding her. You could have suggested any number of other outings, but you chose to invite everyone over knowing she was not allowed to come.\n\nI'm not surprised she is upset by this, and I think that it was an AH move on your part. Coexisting with your ex in a shared friend group means you shouldn't be doing things that willfully exclude them and only them. I also think part of your post reads as disingenuous. You said you've been so kind and courteous to her and haven't pushed her away, but this is exactly what you did by inviting everyone but her over. \n\nIf you want the break up to take less of a toll on you, stop doing things that deliberately exclude your ex from your shared friend group. When you do this, it probably makes everyone else uncomfortable and makes them feel like they have to pick sides. It could also backfire on you entirely. You already have one mutual friend who thinks what you did was an AH move. Be an adult and get over your break up. She was part of the group before you started dating, so it's wrong for you to deliberately exclude her and then act like you are the one who was wronged.", "NTA it was your party at your house and she is your ex.  You may have common friends but she an ex for a reason and you are not her emotional support person when she isn't invited to your place to hang out.  That friend is her flying monkey, the relationship with your ex is over and it is your house/apartment, she wants you to feel guilty for her being left out.", "Get over yourself. Why do people make things so complicated.", "ESH - because you contradict yourself. You said you met her in your friend group in the beginning and by the end suddenly she only met and became friends with you because y\u2019all dated. Both can\u2019t be true, so what else is only a half truth?", "NTA.  But it sounds like your friends are going to have to take sides bc obviously seeing her is not helping you move on.", "NTA. Not inviting her when you\u2019re hosting is less messy option, she should also see this. Think about your future gf, she might become insecure if it\u2019s normal for your ex to be at your place.", "NTA for sticking firm to your boundaries but inviting everyone but her right in front of her was a really petty and rude move. You can enforce boundaries south out being cruel.", "The friends absolutely have to decide who to support. If they're Switzerland, they're not friends to begin with. This isn't a sustainable group as is.", "Your ex girlfriend never has any right to be in your home. End of discussion.", "I need to edit the post because this keeps being brought up. \n\nSomeone introduced her to the group, and two weeks later we started dating. And since we started dating, she always came with us as we go out every weekend and it became her friend group too. \n\nSo it\u2019s not like I introduced her to the group as my girlfriend, but also she has not been part of us since the years we\u2019ve been hanging out.", "I think OP is being shady here. His post clearly says she was a part of the group, but I think he's going to edit this out because of YTA rulings. I'm surprised more people aren't calling him out for this. If she wasn't a part of the group, why did they discuss how to move forward with seeing each other every weekend when they all hung out? \n\nIf she wasn't part of the group, I feel like she wouldn't be welcome to keep hanging out with them and probably wouldn't want to anyways.", "It's even worse tbh. \n\nThe fact that not one of them said \"oh nah man I can't just ditch \"Ella\" can I?\n\nThen had the audacity to act like OP is the bad guy because apparently the allure of a house party is to hard to refuse for them? If they were under the legal drink age different story but the fact that not one turned and said \"oh you guys have fun, me and Ella are off clubbing instead\" \n\nNTA OP", "nah he doesn't need her, or her flying monkey.  She is his ex as an adult, she knows that she can have her feelings of being hurt and excluded.  Those are valid but it's not up to him to invite her with his friends when they hang out at his place.  It is his place not hers, not theirs.", "To be honest her overreaction to this seems to be more about the fact that they all ditched her in a heartbeat. \n\nShe has deep abandonment issues, and is usually avoidant and arrogant to her friends. Her childhood friend cut all ties with her when we were in a relationship, seemingly for no reason (which was a red flag) and she had no other friends apart from our mutuals, which she got to know two weeks before starting dating me. \n\nI try to make it easy for her even though she doesn\u2019t really deserve it. I was so unappreciated and taken advantage off during the relarionship. I still don\u2019t want her to be completely alone though, some of my friends told me that if I don\u2019t want her around they can stop seeing and inviting her.", "I met her through my friend group because someone from us introduced us to her in a party. Two weeks after that, we started dating. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she was part of the group for the years that we\u2019ve hanged out together - and we were friends before dating.", "I\u2019ve clarified this in another comment. \n\n> How so? I met her through the friend group because one of the people there introduced her to us at a party. Two weeks later we started dating. And for the past half year that we were together, she hung out with us.", "Okay we had a pretty similar situation in my friend group. We took the girl in and she became part of our group. After the break up we tried to do things with them separately but she liked how it was and he wanted her back. Ended with her and his best friend having sex on a vacation we all were on together and then splitting up the whole group. NTA in my eyes. You handled the situation so far better then one can expect you to (from what the post says) but situations like those rarely end well. :-/", "It just seems like you are changing your narrative whenever people point out what *you* said in your post. This whole chunk here contradicts everything you are claiming in the comments:\n\n>The worst thing is that **me and my ex met through my friend group**, and we're a lot of people. So as she broke up with me, the question that arose was what would happen considering **we share the same friend group, and we go out every weekend.** I told her it will be difficult, but we can keep hanging out - although we won't be friends and we won't have a relationship together. I don't keep contact with my exes.\n\nEither she was a part of the friend group or she wasn't. Your post makes it clear she was. If she wasn't, you wouldn't have ever had to discuss how to handle future gatherings. I also feel like if she had just been pulled into your friend group because you dated her, she probably wouldn't want to keep hanging out with these people. The fact that she does\u2014as well as the fact that a mutual friend stood up for her\u2014makes it clear she's a part of this group.\n\nWhether you like it or not, what you did was AH behavior. These are her friends too. By choosing to move a gathering she was a part of to your house knowing she was not allowed to go there, you were deliberately excluding her. I honestly kind of wonder how more of your friends would feel if they knew the whole story. You already have one person who is upset with you on your ex's behalf.\n\nDo the rest of your friends know that you've barred your ex from your house, or do they think that she just chose not to go out that night of her own volition? I think if you keep doing things like this, you're going to end up splitting the friend group. It also just seems like you are trying really hard to paint yourself as being mature when what you did was really petty. Just get over your break up, and stop doing things to create drama in your friend group.", "You\u2019re definitely not being mature about this. She\u2019s friends with your friends now too. YTA for pulling this stunt. You intentionally excluded her, how is that not trying to kick her out? This kind of behavior will divide your friend group and force them to take sides. I guarantee you they won\u2019t all choose you."]}
