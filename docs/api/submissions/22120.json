It was not a long relationship, but I got invested in way too much and the breakup took a toll in me.\n\nThe worst thing is that me and my ex met through my friend group, and we're a lot of people. So as she broke up with me, the question that arose was what would happen considering we share the same friend group, and we go out every weekend. I told her it will be difficult, but we can keep hanging out - although we won't be friends and we won't have a relationship together. I don't keep contact with my exes. \n\nNow, during the past month, it has been quite difficult for me to have her present at every moment and gathering, but I have managed. We greet each other and that's that, we don't interact. It's a bit easier because there are always 7-8 people when we hang out.\n\nLast weekend, we were hanging out and it kinda seemed like no one wanted to go to a bar. So I suggested we all buy some booze and get to my place. Now my ex was there, and she knows my boundaries. I throw these house parties often, in fact, we kissed for the first time at a gathering at my place. \n\nBut obviously I didn't want her to be there. And everyone wanted to come. We left for our houses and then we gathered at my spot and had a great time.\n\nThe next day, a mutual friend told me that she was very angry and disappointed at me for pushing her away like that - and making her spend the night alone. This friend was kinda \"against\" me too, telling me that she doesn't deserve it. I told her that I am not doing anything bad, and in fact, I have been **more** than patient and courteous not pushing her away from the group, considering some shit that she has told about me, or how under-appreciated I felt during the relationship. Also the fact that this was originally my friend group, and they mostly \"accepted\" her due to her being my girlfriend. \n\nI am in crossroads about this. I am not apologizing, but I don't want to feel guilty. This whole breakup has taken such a toll on me, and situations like this make it difficult for me to move on.", "created_utc": 1689258938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ymju8/aita_for_inviting_on_the_spot_all_my_friends/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, she should\u2019ve realised this would happen sooner or later - that everybody would gather at your place where she was not welcome. She knew that was a thing the group often did Would it have been nicer not to invite everyone in front of her? Sure, but things happen and you did not do it to be mean to her. \n\nIf they were mainly your friendship group to behind with, I think I would personally have pulled away from the group if I was her. Sounds like you have been the most mature in all of this, accepting her being there while she was spreading rumours and stuff.

Her dragging another person into it makes her a jerk. You both need to better communicate and try to act maturely. It sounds like it\u2019s good you broke up.", "YTA, don\u2019t date inside your friend group if you cannot handle the fallout of dating within your friend group.
