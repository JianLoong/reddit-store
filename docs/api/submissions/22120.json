If this were really your close friends first and mostl, accepted her when you two got together then NTA. You seemed to have handled the situation rather maturely from the description in the post so far and this seems to have been a regular thing before you two broke up (the small home parties at your place). Honestly those people sound more like your inner circle and support system (after all they all ditched her in a heart beat at this occasion, no one spoke up for her when you voiced the idea and everyone was fine with it), she should have pulled away for a while after she broke up with you, out of respect for you. Ofc excluding her is a bit of a dick move but she naturally should have kept more distance to you after the break up.", "YTA. It would be OK to invite your friends to your house and exclude your ex if you were not already all hanging out together. But because you were essentially taking an existing party and moving it, and leaving her behind, that makes it a dick move.", "YTA. You said at the start of your post that you met through a shared friend group. This means you all knew each other before, and she was a part of this group before she started dating you. \n\nAfter the break up, you said you were fine still hanging out as a group but didn't want her at your house. When planning a weekend out with everyone, you suggest to have it at your place, where you KNOW you have told your ex she is not welcome. So when you made the suggestion for the group to go to your house, you were deliberately excluding her. You could have suggested any number of other outings, but you chose to invite everyone over knowing she was not allowed to come.\n\nI'm not surprised she is upset by this, and I think that it was an AH move on your part. Coexisting with your ex in a shared friend group means you shouldn't be doing things that willfully exclude them and only them. I also think part of your post reads as disingenuous. You said you've been so kind and courteous to her and haven't pushed her away, but this is exactly what you did by inviting everyone but her over. \n\nIf you want the break up to take less of a toll on you, stop doing things that deliberately exclude your ex from your shared friend group. When you do this, it probably makes everyone else uncomfortable and makes them feel like they have to pick sides. It could also backfire on you entirely. You already have one mutual friend who thinks what you did was an AH move. Be an adult and get over your break up. She was part of the group before you started dating, so it's wrong for you to deliberately exclude her and then act like you are the one who was wronged.", "NTA it was your party at your house and she is your ex.  You may have common friends but she an ex for a reason and you are not her emotional support person when she isn't invited to your place to hang out.

Think about your future gf, she might become insecure if it\u2019s normal for your ex to be at your place.", "NTA for sticking firm to your boundaries but inviting everyone but her right in front of her was a really petty and rude move. You can enforce boundaries with out being cruel.\n\nWould you want someone to do that to you? And be honest.

She is his ex as an adult, she knows that she can have her feelings of being hurt and excluded.  Those are valid but it's not up to him to invite her with his friends when they hang out at his place.  It is his place not hers, not theirs.", "To be honest her overreaction to this seems to be more about the fact that they all ditched her in a heartbeat. \n\nShe has deep abandonment issues, and is usually avoidant and arrogant to her friends. Her childhood friend cut all ties with her when we were in a relationship, seemingly for no reason (which was a red flag) and she had no other friends apart from our mutuals, which she got to know two weeks before starting dating me. \n\nI try to make it easy for her even though she doesn\u2019t really deserve it. I was so unappreciated and taken advantage off during the relarionship. I still don\u2019t want her to be completely alone though, some of my friends told me that if I don\u2019t want her around they can stop seeing and inviting her.", "I met her through my friend group because someone from us introduced us to her in a party. Two weeks after that, we started dating. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she was part of the group for the years that we\u2019ve hanged out together - and we were friends before dating.", "I\u2019ve clarified this in another comment. \n\n> How so? I met her through the friend group because one of the people there introduced her to us at a party. Two weeks later we started dating. And for the past half year that we were together, she hung out with us.", "Okay we had a pretty similar situation in my friend group. We took the girl in and she became part of our group. After the break up we tried to do things with them separately but she liked how it was and he wanted her back. Ended with her and his best friend having sex on a vacation we all were on together and then splitting up the whole group. NTA in my eyes. You handled the situation so far better then one can expect you to (from what the post says) but situations like those rarely end well. :-/", "It just seems like you are changing your narrative whenever people point out what *you* said in your post. This whole chunk here contradicts everything you are claiming in the comments:\n\n>The worst thing is that **me and my ex met through my friend group**, and we're a lot of people. So as she broke up with me, the question that arose was what would happen considering **we share the same friend group, and we go out every weekend.** I told her it will be difficult, but we can keep hanging out - although we won't be friends and we won't have a relationship together. I don't keep contact with my exes.\n\nEither she was a part of the friend group or she wasn't. Your post makes it clear she was. If she wasn't, you wouldn't have ever had to discuss how to handle future gatherings. I also feel like if she had just been pulled into your friend group because you dated her, she probably wouldn't want to keep hanging out with these people. The fact that she does\u2014as well as the fact that a mutual friend stood up for her\u2014makes it clear she's a part of this group.\n\nWhether you like it or not, what you did was AH behavior. These are her friends too. By choosing to move a gathering she was a part of to your house knowing she was not allowed to go there, you were deliberately excluding her. I honestly kind of wonder how more of your friends would feel if they knew the whole story. You already have one person who is upset with you on your ex's behalf.\n\nDo the rest of your friends know that you've barred your ex from your house, or do they think that she just chose not to go out that night of her own volition? I think if you keep doing things like this, you're going to end up splitting the friend group. It also just seems like you are trying really hard to paint yourself as being mature when what you did was really petty. Just get over your break up, and stop doing things to create drama in your friend group.", "You\u2019re definitely not being mature about this. She\u2019s friends with your friends now too. YTA for pulling this stunt. You intentionally excluded her, how is that not trying to kick her out? This kind of behavior will divide your friend group and force them to take sides. I guarantee you they won\u2019t all choose you.", "YTA. Not wanting your ex in your home or at your party is a perfectly reasonable boundary. But being out with a group and then suggesting an activity where all but one person is invited or able to participate is a huge asshole move and very intentional. \n\nYou seem incredibly bitter that a girl you didn\u2019t date for that long broke up with you. While understandably upsetting, breaking up with someone is not inherently wrongdoing or mistreatment. If you want to throw a party without her fine but don\u2019t organize and talk about that party in front of her.", "If you share your friend group you can\u2019t apply the \u201cI don\u2019t speak to ex\u2019s rule\u201d this is like a Ross and Rachel situation. \n\nI understand you want boundaries but wouldn\u2019t you feel bad if everyone was hanging out and u were left out to go home? You are gonna have to break your own rule and coexist in this group together. \n\nIf you don\u2019t wanna do that then you may have to stop hosting at your house if she\u2019s present. You can still organise get togethers and not invite her but at least she can make her own plans instead of watching everyone leave to go to yours. It couldn\u2019t have felt good for her.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to me like it was a toxic situation or something unforgivable happened between you two. She might have talked about you but I guess it\u2019s normal to vent to a friend. It might have not been true but it was probably true to her and her perception of the situation. You wouldn\u2019t have heard about it if you didn\u2019t have common friend but it\u2019s what you guy signed for when you decided to date knowing it would be difficult to detach from one another.  \n\nNow I don\u2019t think YTA because you are within your right not to be ready to be around her yet. It\u2019s just not sustainable in the long term without causing issue within the group and it seems like you guys are good friends and have something good going.\n\nEventually feelings will fade and it will be fine. I was part of quiet a large friend group when I was younger where people dated each other, sometimes it didn\u2019t work out but they wouldn\u2019t exclude one another, they just didn\u2019t interact as much but there was no hostility. They just put it behind them and got on with it. \n\nYou both took a risk when u dated each other, it didn\u2019t work out it\u2019s time to move on from it.", "Yta", "YTA.  You can't invite a portion of the group back to your house without being an AH.  In addition, your \"not being friends with exes\" as a principle is a red flag.   Your claim that you are unappreciated and should basically receive praise for not pushing her out of the friend group is ridiculous and I hope your friend group sees your bitterness and poor character well enough to push you out.", "YTA and I can't believe people are saying otherwise. Basically the 8 of you were hanging out trying to decide what to do and you said, let's all - EXCEPT YOU, YOU ARENT ALLOWED ^I ^HAVE ^A ^RULE!!! - go do this.\n\nIf you expect to stay in the same friend group with her you're gonna have to grow up.", "I thought there was an unwritten rule that if you join a friends group that was your partners you leave the friend group when the relationship is over??", "NTA ask that \"friend\" why did she go to your house? If she cared so much about her she could stay with her than and she wouldnt be lonely but see that friend didnt care eather so she can shut up\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Don't let anyone tell you that you're obligated to invite someone you're not comfortable with back to your house. Her hurt feelings are understandable, but also not your fault and not your problem.", "I feel like the fact that you were all already hanging out together makes it a little sticky, even if you didn\u2019t verbally say \u201cexcept you.\u201d \n\nThis seems like something that was bound to happen eventually, and will probably happen again, and next time it could be you that\u2019s excluded from her party. I think that\u2019s just something you\u2019ll both have to accept if you want to keep hanging out in the same friend group. I think the kind/mature thing would be for you and your ex to acknowledge that there will inevitably be times where one of you is left out, but agree to both avoid doing what happened here where someone was basically forced out of an existing plan to hang out later, on short notice and in front of everyone, because that feels a lot shittier than just texting your friends and finding out they already have plans. \n\nIf you don\u2019t particularly care if she feels left out or not, I guess that\u2019s understandable. But I would think about how your friends feel as well. The more issues and conflicts you two have, the more your friends may feel pressured to choose a side, and even people who are on your side might start to feel resentful of the tension you\u2019ve both introduced into the group. Even if you ask her to compromise and keep the peace and she says \u201cfuck you,\u201d at least you\u2019d get points for trying. \n\nI think I\u2019m going with NAH. I don\u2019t think you were being intentionally mean by suggesting everyone come to your house, especially since it was something you\u2019ve done a lot before so it makes sense that you would continue to do it. But the way you did it was kind of rude and I also don\u2019t blame her for feeling shitty about it. Also, your friends make their own decisions. Any of them could have suggested somewhere else or decided to do something with her instead. Making the suggestion was on you, but choosing to go when they knew she couldn\u2019t is on them. I think the smart move here is to keep the peace as much as you can without compromising on your boundaries. Either she plays along or she\u2019ll eventually get phased out for causing drama.", "It\u2019s a bit a \u201cdon\u2019t chew gum if you don\u2019t have enough for everyone\u201d situation.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have her over, you\u2019re NTA for that, but like mothers said, be prepared for your friends to feel like they have to decide between you and her.  No matter who broke up, the fact that you\u2019re the one actively excluding her, it might not go in your favor.\n\nA month is still very recent for a breakup, the wound will be sore for a long time especially if you see her that often.\n\nDon\u2019t be friend with her if you don\u2019t want to be friend, but not because of a \u201cI don\u2019t keep contact with exes\u201d principle.  She was someone you liked before and unless you discovered something new during the relationship, she\u2019s still the same person.", "NTA. \nThat\u2019s just how\u2026\nBreakups work?", "NTA", "Did y\u2019all meet through the friend group or did they \u201c\u2018accept\u2019 her due to being your girlfriend\u201d?  I smell some missing missing reasons", "NTA. she broke up with you, she knew this was a possibility. why is it okay for your comfort and boundaries to be broken and crossed just so she doesn\u2019t have to spend one night alone? GROW UP. that is not how we adult. GOOD ON YOU FOR STICKING TO YOUR BOUNDARIES. you should NEVER feel guilty for protecting your boundaries. if it were me, I\u2019d cut the friend that\u2019s against you out of plans at my house as well. it\u2019s your house, under no means is anyone entitled to be there that you don\u2019t want there. NTA", "Boundaries are one thing. And I was someone that started cutting off contact with my exes. Tried to be friends a couple times and it was just not good for my mental well-being.

With that said, it sounds like she did nothing to trample that boundary; she just expressed to a mutual friend separately that it hurt her.\n\nWith that said, be careful: I made the mistake of dating someone and joining their friend group around the same time. He was the one who hosted every week, because his apartment was the most central and most of us couldn\u2019t afford to go out to socialize. He had also put me in contact with another member of the group who was looking for a roommate, so even though we only dated for a month or two (it\u2019s been several years now, can\u2019t remember exactly how long), I was pretty integrated in the group. The breakup was as close to mutual as such things can be, but mostly initiated by him; we just weren\u2019t compatible, though emotionally it wasn\u2019t easy to admit that. After the breakup, he decided he wasn\u2019t comfortable having me in his apartment, but his friends weren\u2019t okay with that; admittedly, in this case he had a history of manipulating people to be in control, but they also felt on principle that it was wrong for him to exclude me when there was nowhere else we usually hung out. The others refused to go to his socials anymore (I tried to convince them to keep going, literally spent hours explaining that I wasn\u2019t offended and didn\u2019t mind them going without me), and eventually my roommate decided that because ours was the most central apartment after his, we\u2019d take over hosting and he could choose whether to come. He felt even less comfortable being in an apartment that was partly mine than having me in his, so while technically it was his choice, in practice he basically got cut out of the group. I never felt good about it, but couldn\u2019t force anyone to keep going to his place.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is, depending on how much she\u2019s integrated with the group, people may not choose you if they realize it could be you or her. Even if she wouldn\u2019t choose to exclude you, you could end up excluding yourself.", "NTA", "YTA", "YTA, you left her out and its not fair since she is also in your friend group.

That's the whole of the matter.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone was a consenting adult and consented to go to your house to continue partying. Evidently, they really aren't her friends. She became part of the friend group because the one and only friend she has introduced her to group. They accepted her after you two started dating. Now that you two have broken up, they are all cool with coming back to your home and leaving her to figure out something else. Regardless of whether she was present during this exchange doesn't matter. What matters is that the friend group all chose to leave her behind, except her one friend. Besides that, she told her only friend that you looking at her makes her uncomfortable. Oh. Kay. Then why keep hanging around you?\n\nYour ex needs to find some more friends on her own because the friend group kinda sorta chose and they didn't choose her. It sucks but it is better for her to find out now and move on.", "YTA for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. If this was a case where some people are going to your house and not others, that would be fine. If this was a case where the plan from the get-go was to go to your house, that too would be fine, because presumably she would have taken her unwelcome status into account when planning her evening. But to be out with a group that she is a part of, and spontaneously invite everyone to your house except the one person - that's kind of a dick move. She expected to spend the evening with her group of friends, and now she suddenly finds herself alone because you singled her out.\n2. Your claim that you \"have been more than patient and courteous not pushing her away from the group,\" makes you sound like a major AH. The fact that she got integrated into the group because of you is no longer relevant. She is a part of the group now, because the rest of the group considers her so. They don't need your permission to continue to be her friend, and you most certainly don't have the authority to demand that she be \"removed\" from the group. Are you really egotistical enough to think that the group will just do as you say?", "NAH", "YTA for sure. But also your friend group should have said either we all go or we find something else to do. Like others have said , you plan a party ahead of the and don't invite her that's w.e. but if you're all together such it up for a night buttercup. Also kind of shitty bc it's usually understood by adults that if you date in the friend group and the break up is relatively amicable you don't divide the friend group. You're ok with her being everywhere else around you ... so it was clearly a move that came from bitterness and pettiness. It sounds like you're not over her and you're making it a problem. It is unbelievably rude and shows little grace and poor character to suggest going to your place while already hanging out w people and telling one person they can't come. I am still mostly shocked though that your friends were all OK with that.  I hope your ex gf finds better and more considerate ppl to surround herself with. And I hope you mature enough to realize that if you're OK in a room w her at one place but not in another it's you whose the problem. Also please don't date in the friend group if this is how you act.", "Shes upset you look at her and you\u2019re also obligated to bring her into your home? I don\u2019t think so.

Yes, some breakups were harder than others, bit I recognized that staying together wasn't going to work either - but I still liked who they were as humans, I was attracted to something there, it just wasn't destined to be a romantic relationship. I still talk with two of them on a regular basis. One is married to my best friend and I am the godparent to one of their children.

No red flags, just adulting the best way they can. \n\nPart of growing up (this is not a slam on your maturity, but merely a nod to your age) is learning that not every relationship is forever. That includes friendships as well as romantic relationships! Some will last a long time, some you will outgrow, some will fade away, most will change in some way over time - even marriages. Some will burn brightly and then fizzle out just as suddenly. \n\nIt isn't a character flaw that someone is no longer romantically interested in you, it isn't a character flaw if you are no longer interested in them - as long as you are respectful and adult about it, honest and open. \n\nThis one didn't work out. That's sad and of course you are hurt - but did you ever stop to think that this didn't work out because there is something even better out there?
