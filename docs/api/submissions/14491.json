Don\u2019t lie to people about what\u2019s in their food.\n\nAlso, you all grinning at each other as she ate it was some weird group power trip. You\u2019re bullies, and I hope she gets out.", "YTA. That was cruel and on top of that you humiliated her. You all laughed at her like it was some really elaborate hilarious thing you did. Your behaviour was gross and you I hope you walk about from this understanding why you\u2019re the AH.", "YTA.\n\nEver think she might have had an allergy to seafood/shellfish, and that's why she avoids eating them? If she had an allergy, you could have killed her with that little trick.\n\nAnd even if she wasn't allergic, you're still an asshole for tricking her into eating something she doesn't like.", "YTA\n\nLying to people to get them to eat something almost always makes you the asshole.

Maybe your girlfriend just knows what her body can tolerate. YTA who cares if she eats like a five year old.

Ugh secondly, it could\u2019ve been a cultural thing. Thirdly, just NO! No, no, no!!", "YTA, you lied to her. Did you even consider the fact that she migt have been allergic to sea food ?", "YTA and needs to grow up.\n\nIf she doesn't like shrimp then she doesn't like shrimp. Why play this childish game? It's not even funny. You're 23 years old. Not 10. You could have killed someone if they were allergic.", "YTA and a liar. Even the title of your post is a lie. You didn't just not tell her, you where specifically asked and lied to her. What's worse you will describe it as \"pretty funny\" and don't see that what you did was wrong. Your friend wasn't in a relationship with her so it wasn't your friend's obligation to be honest with her, it was your yours.

Hopefully your ex girlfriend  will find someone more trustworthy next time.", "YTA.\n\nDon't lie about what's in food. Ever.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nThe only time it's acceptable to lie to somebody about what's in their food to get them to try it is if they're like, a very young child.

Other than to be an asshole to trick her, what\u2019s the point of lying?", "YTA. I can't believe how often I see people on here tricking someone into eating a food they either don't like or have an intolerance/allergy to.    Regardless of their reason for not wanting the food, you should never deceive someone into doing something they don't want to do just for your own amusement. \n\nYou are the one who needs to grow up. Pranking and tricking people is immature.", "YTA\n\nYou lied and tricked her, whether you think it\u2019s harmless or not, not cool.", "Whoa!! YTA! That was extremely rude and disrespectful. It's okay to have personal food preferences. It's okay that she doesn't like seafood. It has nothing to do with you. But lying to her and making it a joke was immature and a red flag against you.", "YTA.\n\nIt's ok to be annoyed by the behavior and if it's a deal breaker for you that a partner is picky with food, you need to end it. But women aren't dolls you can mold into what you want. You either accept this about her, or you don't. \n\nI saw in one of the comments that it effects you because you can't split things. You can. You can split the things she likes.

But that exactly describes you and the others.\n\nNever ever ever take that risk of tricking sometime into eating something that have expressly told you they do not want to eat. It's a shitty thing to do.\n\nYTA.\n\nAlso some people will tell you they don't like something but actually they have an allergy to it, and simply don't want to get into medical details with you. That's their right. \n\nA stupid prank like this could backfire very badly. \n\nGrow up!", "YTA.", "YTA and that was a betrayal of trust.  Beyond despicable. That should be a deal breaker.", "YTA\n\nYeah, its dumb that she probably doesn't actually dislike fish, but lying to her to get her to eat fish?\n\nIn what world do you think this is smart behavior? Grow up.", "YTA, your girlfriend trusted you and if you lie about something so ridiculous as food she doesn't like, what else are you willing to lie about that might put her life in danger one day for the sake of laughs and an \"I'm right\" attitude. You need to grow up and treat people with respect", "Ugh gross. Yta", "YTA- She should be able to choose what she wants to eat.", "YTA, you violated her boldily autonomy by interfering with her right to control what goes into it. \n\nYou suck.", "YTA. If this was an allergy you could have killed her. You never mess with peoples food. I hope she dumps you.", "YTA and based off your replies, you definitely know it and are trying to cover.

Plenty of people avoid those foods for religious reasons alone.\n\nYTA.", "YTA for lying and having a weird conspiracy with your friends over it.", "YTA. Just because she ate something with shrimp in it doesn't automatically mean she \"obviously likes shrimp.\" She couldn't taste it and thought it wasn't there. Why would you trick your gf into eating something she doesn't want to? What's funny about this?", "YTA and the one who needs to grow up. You are lucky she just doesn't like shrimp, because you could have killed her. Shame on you and your friends. I hope she dumps you.", "Sorry, but YTA. I get your frustration, but you do not fuck with shell fish and peanuts, people can have leathel reactions, even to trace amounts. I know people ought to be upfront if they have such allergies, but they can be selfconcious for good reason, some people get real wierd around allergies.\n\nEven if she is not allergic, there can be loads of psychological reasons for pickiness. Having others comment on it rarely creates the safe space to overcome whatever barriers cause pickiness.\n\nI know you probably Mean well, but manipulation isnt going to do What you want it to do.", "YTA for sure. The biggest reason that you're the asshole is right here : \"the three of us smiled at each other and watched my gf happily eat them.\" You made her the butt of a prank and joke that you knew would upset her and you intentionally embarrassed her.", "YTA.  I always hated seafood so I never ate it, I didn't find out until I was in my 20's that I was allergic to some seafood because I never tried to eat it.  Eventually some got mixed in my food and I ended up in the hospital.  Don't lie to people about what they are eating", "YTA I\u2019m a picky eater and often it\u2019s not bc we\u2019re immature and afraid to try new things, it\u2019s a texture and smell issue.", "dude, YTA. and your friend is also. and your other comments affirm that because you\u2019re calling her palate childlike. why does it matter if she doesn\u2019t eat certain foods? just because you can trick her by literally lying to her you think you can call it a joke? it\u2019s not even funny tbh.", "YTA. Look, I am a picky eater and hate sharing food. Some people are bothered by this, and if it is truly a dealbreaker for you, that's fine. What is not fine is lying to your girlfriend, treating her like she can't possibly know what she wants, and making her the punchline of a joke to your friends. \n\nIf you really can't live with being in a relationship with someone who doesn't like fish or pork, go ahead and break up with her but don't do this kind of thing. It's mean and manipulative. And if your girlfriend can't live with being in a relationship with someone who treats her like this, she should break up with you. No one deserves to be tricked by someone who is supposed to be on their team.", "YTA and I wouldn't be surprised if she isn't your gf for much longer. If she's reading this I have seven words for her \"RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN\". What would you have done if she'd been allergic to the shrimp and just didn't want to say anything. I'm pretty sure you were a bully in high school and it sounds like you and your friend are still bullies. Karma has a way of biting people in the rear when they least expect it. To bad I can't be a fly on the wall when it finally kicks you.  How about you quit being a jerk and grow up!!!!!!", "YTA\n\nAs is everyone who lies to people about food they\u2019re being served.

Fucking with people\u2019s foods or food preferences as a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment is shitty and childish. \n\nLying to someone you *allegedly* care about then dismissing her feelings as her being \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d makes you a shit boyfriend. \n\nGrow up.", "YTA- I don\u2019t think that eating something that has minced shrimp mixed in means that \u201cobviously she likes shrimp\u201d.\n\u201c..now I\u2019m the bad guy even though my friend was in on it too\u201d, it\u2019s not your friends obligation to look out for your gf, it should be yours.\nAt least now she knows you can\u2019t be trusted.", "My God, of course YTA.", "YTA - Absolutely you're wrong in this case, but I have so many friends who are picky eaters and have wondered what it would be like if they didn't know what was in things. But you can't do this to people, esp since some people do have allergies.", "YTA. Don't fucking treat her like a child, that's disgusting", "You didn't just not tell her it had shrimp in it, you lied when she asked if it did and then grinned because you and your friends were so proud of your lie. YTA.", "YTA. Yes, she's a picky eater and it's pretty ridiculous. But treat her like an adult anyway. \n\nMore spring rolls for the rest of you anyway.", "YTA, seriously you should never lie about what is in food because it is a rotten power play and it isn\u2019t your place to decide what someone else eats.  Additionally it\u2019s mega YTA as many people avoid certain foods as it\u2019s make them feel like crap after eating them (intolerance rather than allergy). \n\nI have some intolerances but like many people go with the don\u2019t like/no thank you to certain foods as it saves a lot of bother.  And yep I\u2019ve also had someone charmingly decide to treat me like a five year old and tell me that the hotdogs were normal ones, definitely not the quorn ones. I spent all night and the rest of the weekend worshipping the porcelain god.", "YTA. you don\u2019t lie about food or fuck with someone\u2019s food. done and dusted.", "YTA this is a great way to get your gf not to trust you anymore.

You intentionally misled her and allowed her to eat something containing food she didn\u2019t like, which is uncool. What\u2019s even more uncool is that you\u2019re so blas\u00e9 about it, even thinking it\u2019s funny. How would you feel if she did the same to you?", "YTA and wont have a girlfriend much longer. Feeding or tricking people into eating something against their personal diet can actually come with criminal consequence in some places.

I wash my hands before touching anything, and I check every single ingredient before adding it to a dish of his. People think I'm insane for going to such lengths to accommodate his dietary needs. But guess what I don\u2019t do? I don't sneak meat into his food or make fun of him for it. I tell him exactly what's in each dish he eats. Know why? The food is going into HIS body. He gets control over his body, end of discussion. To trick him into eating meat wouldn\u2019t kill him, but it would be a complete breach of his consent and trust.

I may not understand picky eaters, but it's incredibly rude, childish, and disrespectful of their food choices to do what you did. \n\nAnd there is always a chance that someone has a food allergy/sensitivity that they've downplayed as being picky. Or maybe she has an aversion to certain textures, or the thought of eating something creepy looking. Her choices are valid even if you don't agree with them.

She is saying that's not cool to mislead  her like that and trick her into eating something she doesn't want to  eat. But she makes no sense- she ATE the spring rolls so obviously she  likes shrimp.\n\nAITA or is she being too sensitive and needs to grow up?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
