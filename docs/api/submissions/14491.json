You didn't just not tell her, you where specifically asked and lied to her. What's worse you will describe it as \"pretty funny\" and don't see that what you did was wrong.

Other than to be an asshole to trick her, what\u2019s the point of lying?", "YTA. I can't believe how often I see people on here tricking someone into eating a food they either don't like or have an intolerance/allergy to.    Regardless of their reason for not wanting the food, you should never deceive someone into doing something they don't want to do just for your own amusement. \n\nYou are the one who needs to grow up.

But women aren't dolls you can mold into what you want. You either accept this about her, or you don't. \n\nI saw in one of the comments that it effects you because you can't split things. You can.

It's a shitty thing to do.\n\nYTA.\n\nAlso some people will tell you they don't like something but actually they have an allergy to it, and simply don't want to get into medical details with you.

Grow up.", "YTA, your girlfriend trusted you and if you lie about something so ridiculous as food she doesn't like, what else are you willing to lie about that might put her life in danger one day for the sake of laughs and an \"I'm right\" attitude.

You are lucky she just doesn't like shrimp, because you could have killed her. Shame on you and your friends. I hope she dumps you.", "Sorry, but YTA. I get your frustration, but you do not fuck with shell fish and peanuts, people can have leathel reactions, even to trace amounts. I know people ought to be upfront if they have such allergies, but they can be selfconcious for good reason, some people get real wierd around allergies.\n\nEven if she is not allergic, there can be loads of psychological reasons for pickiness. Having others comment on it rarely creates the safe space to overcome whatever barriers cause pickiness.\n\nI know you probably Mean well, but manipulation isnt going to do What you want it to do.", "YTA for sure. The biggest reason that you're the asshole is right here : \"the three of us smiled at each other and watched my gf happily eat them.\" You made her the butt of a prank and joke that you knew would upset her and you intentionally embarrassed her.", "YTA.  I always hated seafood so I never ate it, I didn't find out until I was in my 20's that I was allergic to some seafood because I never tried to eat it.

Look, I am a picky eater and hate sharing food. Some people are bothered by this, and if it is truly a dealbreaker for you, that's fine. What is not fine is lying to your girlfriend, treating her like she can't possibly know what she wants, and making her the punchline of a joke to your friends. \n\nIf you really can't live with being in a relationship with someone who doesn't like fish or pork, go ahead and break up with her but don't do this kind of thing. It's mean and manipulative. And if your girlfriend can't live with being in a relationship with someone who treats her like this, she should break up with you. No one deserves to be tricked by someone who is supposed to be on their team.", "YTA and I wouldn't be surprised if she isn't your gf for much longer. If she's reading this I have seven words for her \"RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN\". What would you have done if she'd been allergic to the shrimp and just didn't want to say anything. I'm pretty sure you were a bully in high school and it sounds like you and your friend are still bullies. Karma has a way of biting people in the rear when they least expect it.

Don't fucking treat her like a child, that's disgusting", "You didn't just not tell her it had shrimp in it, you lied when she asked if it did and then grinned because you and your friends were so proud of your lie.

But treat her like an adult anyway. \n\nMore spring rolls for the rest of you anyway.", "YTA, seriously you should never lie about what is in food because it is a rotten power play and it isn\u2019t your place to decide what someone else eats.  Additionally it\u2019s mega YTA as many people avoid certain foods as it\u2019s make them feel like crap after eating them (intolerance rather than allergy). \n\nI have some intolerances but like many people go with the don\u2019t like/no thank you to certain foods as it saves a lot of bother.

But guess what I don\u2019t do? I don't sneak meat into his food or make fun of him for it. I tell him exactly what's in each dish he eats. Know why? The food is going into HIS body. He gets control over his body, end of discussion. To trick him into eating meat wouldn\u2019t kill him, but it would be a complete breach of his consent and trust.
