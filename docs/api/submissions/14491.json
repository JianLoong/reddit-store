You didn't just not tell her, you where specifically asked and lied to her. What's worse you will describe it as \"pretty funny\" and don't see that what you did was wrong.

Other than to be an asshole to trick her, what\u2019s the point of lying?", "YTA. I can't believe how often I see people on here tricking someone into eating a food they either don't like or have an intolerance/allergy to.    Regardless of their reason for not wanting the food, you should never deceive someone into doing something they don't want to do just for your own amusement. \n\nYou are the one who needs to grow up.

But women aren't dolls you can mold into what you want. You either accept this about her, or you don't. \n\nI saw in one of the comments that it effects you because you can't split things. You can.

It's a shitty thing to do.\n\nYTA.\n\nAlso some people will tell you they don't like something but actually they have an allergy to it, and simply don't want to get into medical details with you.

Grow up.", "YTA, your girlfriend trusted you and if you lie about something so ridiculous as food she doesn't like, what else are you willing to lie about that might put her life in danger one day for the sake of laughs and an \"I'm right\" attitude.

I get your frustration, but you do not fuck with shell fish and peanuts, people can have leathel reactions, even to trace amounts. I know people ought to be upfront if they have such allergies, but they can be selfconcious for good reason, some people get real wierd around allergies.\n\nEven if she is not allergic, there can be loads of psychological reasons for pickiness. Having others comment on it rarely creates the safe space to overcome whatever barriers cause pickiness.\n\nI know you probably Mean well, but manipulation isnt going to do What you want it to do.", "YTA for sure. The biggest reason that you're the asshole is right here : \"the three of us smiled at each other and watched my gf happily eat them.\" You made her the butt of a prank and joke that you knew would upset her and you intentionally embarrassed her.", "YTA.  I always hated seafood so I never ate it, I didn't find out until I was in my 20's that I was allergic to some seafood because I never tried to eat it.

Look, I am a picky eater and hate sharing food. Some people are bothered by this, and if it is truly a dealbreaker for you, that's fine. What is not fine is lying to your girlfriend, treating her like she can't possibly know what she wants, and making her the punchline of a joke to your friends. \n\nIf you really can't live with being in a relationship with someone who doesn't like fish or pork, go ahead and break up with her but don't do this kind of thing. It's mean and manipulative. And if your girlfriend can't live with being in a relationship with someone who treats her like this, she should break up with you. No one deserves to be tricked by someone who is supposed to be on their team.", "YTA and I wouldn't be surprised if she isn't your gf for much longer. If she's reading this I have seven words for her \"RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN\". What would you have done if she'd been allergic to the shrimp and just didn't want to say anything. I'm pretty sure you were a bully in high school and it sounds like you and your friend are still bullies. Karma has a way of biting people in the rear when they least expect it.

But treat her like an adult anyway. \n\nMore spring rolls for the rest of you anyway.", "YTA, seriously you should never lie about what is in food because it is a rotten power play and it isn\u2019t your place to decide what someone else eats.

But guess what I don\u2019t do? I don't sneak meat into his food or make fun of him for it. I tell him exactly what's in each dish he eats. Know why? The food is going into HIS body. He gets control over his body, end of discussion. To trick him into eating meat wouldn\u2019t kill him, but it would be a complete breach of his consent and trust.

I don't wanna be with a person who won't try new things, but it's also completely valid to be with someone who won't try new foods or to even not wanna try em.\n\nI do think he's slightly an AH for lying, but I also get it, I can understand someone's actions without agreeing to them.\n\nJumping to antisemitism tho is such a reddit thing to do, like wtf, you're acusing someone of literal racism because they wanted their partner to try a new food. While I don't agree with the method and probably wouldn't do the same thing, I do understand why he would do that. I, personally, find it infuriating when adults won't try new foods or things I cannot explain why, I just don't like it, so I posted my opinion on a subreddit meant for people to put their opinions in the comments. Oh dear God NO I didn't agree with everyone else, it's a tragedy.\n\nAs I said, if I go through his comments and find that she was kosher ill edit my comment in a heartbeat. At the end of the day though, we only have the info he has given us, and my opinion is based on the info given.", "**IF** she keeps kosher, then yes. Because it is. There's a reason old school nazis played 'bacon or bullet' with starving Jews, and it wasn't because they wanted to convince them to broaden their horizons. \n\nMaybe you should take some time and evaluate why you get so upset about adults who don't want to try new things. You don't have to date people who prefer to stay in their comfort zone, but finding it infuriating suggests that there's an underlying issue that you might need to tackle. Maybe also take the time and learn that antisemitism comes in many shapes, big and small.", "It's not that they roll in mud. It's about what they eat. Those critters literally eat shit and garbage. Judaism and Muslim are heavy on cleanliness both within and without. There's about 100 different washing ceremonies. Pig, if not properly prepared, can cause some pretty serious issues that were potentially deadly back in the day. Parasites today are cured with a simple pill. Now it's mostly traditional. But initially, most of the rules had a pretty good reason behind them.\n\nEta: yta op!", "Her reasoning, according to OP (assuming he even knows) is because \"she doesn't like fish or pork.\"  Far more likely that it's a preference since kosher diets do not exclude all fish. \n\nWhat confuses me is why her reason would need to be religious in order for the trickery not to be considered a violation. She has her food preference, and he can either respect it or respect it. Nothing else.", "They aren\u2019t really two different questions in this instance, he didn\u2019t poison her practically or legally in any sense of the word. He is just a massive AH", "That's the thing though, this is a romantic relationship, and it's weird that he's treating her like a child that doesn't know what's best for herself, and betraying her trust.\n\nMy mom also used to lie to me when I was a child, I have a problem with seafood texture. I can eat some squid flavoured snacks, but squid? Absolutely not. After my mom lied to me to get me to eat calamari saying it was onion rings, I never trusted her with my food again. It hurt my relationship with her, though I did get over it as I grew older. But that's my mom, I don't think I could forgive a s/o for doing the same to me.", "Yeah, you're right. I think I've been seeing this wrong. Her bf needs to learn to respect her boundaries, ridiculous or not. He doesn't get to control her, She deserves to feel what she wants to feel.\n\nBtw, I agree with you. Squid is disgusting.", "YTA. It\u2019s not of your business if she doesn\u2019t want to eat something, you need to respect it. You have absolutely no respect for her and enjoy grouping with your friends in order to lie to her. Not cool. I would break up with you.", "They both need to grow up. Picky eaters are insufferable. And childish assholes that trick you to eat something are insufferable too.", "I get you, really I do. But I make a Coconut Curry Soup that my whole family loves. When the kids were little, they begged me not to put fish sauce in it because they hated fish. I have always continued to put fish sauce in it, because it is better that way. I lied to my kids the first time, and then have lied by omission ever since and they have never asked again. I know I am lying by omission every time, but dammit, they love the soup. Now I guess I really am TA. They are adults or almost adults now and I am scared to tell them.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from. It definitely isn\u2019t any of those reason because if she was she would\u2019ve said that. She wouldn\u2019t be picky I\u2019d call her religious or say she has allergies. I feel like picky implies she can eat it she just doesn\u2019t want to.", "3 points really,\n\n1. If it\u2019s his gf and he says she\u2019s a picky eater I think we can assume she\u2019s picky not allergic. \n\n2. If it\u2019s his gf and he says she\u2019s a picky eater I think we can assume it\u2019s not religious. \n\n3. She did like it, she just thought she didn\u2019t beforehand. \n\nThat said, he\u2019s the asshole for lying to her, but it\u2019s just that, not attempted murder or religious bigotry.", "\u2018Violated her bodily autonomy\u2019? That\u2019s a bit over the top. He didn\u2019t force it down her. \n\nIf she only \u201cdoesn\u2019t like\u201d it, it\u2019s hardly an issue.", "No, not even then.", "Most menus I see don\u2019t list what\u2019s in a spring roll. So that point could very well not apply, since she did ask what\u2019s in the spring roll.", "She wasn\u2019t caught in a lie, she probably just couldn\u2019t taste it enough to know it was there", "when I was a child I loved shrimp because my mom loved it and so I wanted to eat it too but after each time I had it I ended up throwing up. I know it wasn't a mental thing because it happened after I ate pizza that my mom removed all the shrimp from (I was begging for pizza but the order was made before we got there) and I didn't know it ever had shrimp in it. I still usually just say that I don't eat shrimp instead of bringing up my allergy bc I don't have to be careful around seafood, just simply avoid eating shrimp", "What he said was \u201cpoor stupid female let me tell you what you like\u201d.", "I\u2019m sure he\u2019d know if it was faith related or allergy related if she\u2019s his girlfriend. Clearly it wasn\u2019t or he would have mentioned it.", "Thankyou,  I can't do shrimp. It's just ick. Not the flavour, just what it is. And that should be ok", "Same with mushrooms, and I often end up doing that, especially in restaurants where the menu item says, \"soup with maize, tomatoes, eggs, onions, and potatoes\", but then it turns out that mushrooms are there, too, they just didn't feel like mentioning that.", "Yeah, as a picky eater myself: DO NOT LIE!!! It\u2019s one thing to \u201cromanticize\u201d the food, like someone else pointed out, and pretend broccolis are \u201ccute green trees\u201d, because the child still sees the food and knows what\u2019s going in their mouth, you\u2019re just whimsically making it more appealing.\n\nI feel like the ONE acceptable way to \u201chide\u201d food from a picky eater is adding vegetables to soup broth and sauce that is smooth/strained enough that they won\u2019t bite/chew any of it, but will get nutrients.", "Exactly.", "THIS! I can't stand the idea of any crustacean or even clams as a food. I don't care if they're delicious. It's the idea that makes me gag. Fish? Oh that's fine, I like fish. But the ones I mentioned? Hell no.", "I mean she is acting like a child. If shrimp were so horrible she would have noticed and stopped eating. He never forced her to do anything.", "Kosher diet is extremely picky. You can not eat dairy products combined with meat and the animals that you are allowed to eat have to have been ritually slaughtered without stunning, a lot of countries legally require that animals are slaughtered humanely with stunning.", "It was fish and pork, so I don't think she was keeping Kosher.", "Yup. I don\u2019t eat pork or shellfish due to keeping kosher, I\u2019m not strictly kosher but I still avoid those foods. If someone tricked me into eating shrimp, I\u2019d be so so so upset and hurt, it\u2019s not funny in the slightest. Not even for the religious aspect but because it\u2019s my choice not to eat those foods and it\u2019s disrespectful to knowingly lie to me about it.", "A friend and I did this to a third friend once when we were young and dumb. Also with shrimp spring rolls. It's one of the biggest regrets in my life and I'm incredibly grateful she forgave us. We thought it'd be a great way to help her get over her dislike of fish, which she said was purely psychological, but it was cruel, demeaning and rude.\n\n\nI'm so sorry your ex violated your trust like that and then manipulated you.", "Same. An ex boyfriend made me eat horse like that...", "Same. \n\nI love spicy food however I have a horrid intolerance to chili. I can just about handle sweet chili sauce but anything more than that and I get horribly sick that evening/the next day. \n\nBoyfriend at the time made stir fry. Added chopped up chili. I thanked him but said I'd have to pick the chili peppers out. He said no problem. \n\nAte the stir fry, noticed it still tasted very hot and asked did he add anything else to it. \n\nHe insisted no. Once I'd finished, he sat there, smirking, arms folded and informed me he'd added chili oil to it and he \"KNEW I was lying about it making me sick.\"\n\nThat night when I was vomiting I made sure to leave the bathroom door open so he could hear every time I got sick and made him call in our of work so he could see exactly how bad the migraine I got from the fucking chili was. \n\nDo NOT fuck around with food.", "People can be unbelievable jerks about others' allergies. I tell people I'm allergic to many different peppers, like cayenne, chili and jalape\u00f1o. I sometimes get called a \"pussy who can't handle spices\". It's less about not being able to handle, it's more about not fucking choking to death.\n\nI once accidentally ate a small slice of jalape\u00f1o on a closed sandwich that I didn't know had it, I almost choked.", "Law of Kashrut.  Beasts must have cloven hooves _and_ chew its cud and anything with fins and scales.  Shalom!", "Orrrr he deliberately left out that information to try and make himself look like less of an asshole.

I\u2018d rather cut my little toe off than eat any of that", "When people say 'literally' they often mean 'not literally'", "More a difference in degree than in kind.\n\nBoth are matters of consent, which OP clearly has a shaky grasp on.", "Reddit moment", "We were forced to eat bacon, liver and onions together because my mom loved it. To this day, liver makes me gag. Even with the tiniest bit of liver, smothered in bacon and onions, that rank flavour stands out.", "Could be religious reasons. Is that still just a preference?", "She doesn\u2019t eat shrimp, so she could very well be allergic, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily know. Neither would he.\n\nYou don\u2019t mess with somebody\u2019s food, period.", "I don\u2019t eat pork for religious reasons, but I don\u2019t like to get into it because people always challenge me on it, and it\u2019s exhausting, so unless I feel comfortable revealing the real reason, which I usually don\u2019t, I just tell people I don\u2019t like pork. Even when I first met my husband, I told him I don\u2019t like pork, until I felt comfortable discussing my personal beliefs more in depth. At the end of the day we don\u2019t owe other people an in depth explanation over our personal food choices.\n\nIf somebody gave it to me anyway, intentionally, and lied about it I would feel EXTREMELY violated. This is about autonomy and consent. It\u2019s just so not okay.", "I agree. Let's stop using hyperbolic language for relatively minor issues. If OPs gf turned out to be allergic to shrimp, poisoning would be totally accurate. In order for it to be felony food poisoning, the food would have to be tampered with by OP, or he would have to have known his gf was severely allergic to shrimp or would otherwise be likely to suffer injury or bodily harm by consuming the food. Then the party bringing charges or legal action would have to explain why his gf didn't bother to look at the menu and read the description of the food they were ordering."]}
