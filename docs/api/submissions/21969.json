All 40+ hours of the work week are 100% on-site, as there is no way to do our work from home. \n\nMy team is under 10 people, and most of those people are temp contractors who do not receive any benefits, which sucks since we are all doing the exact same work. Us actual employees get insane benefits. 180+ hours of PTO, unlimited sick time (they don\u2019t want you sick and around cancer drug products for obvious reasons). It\u2019s extremely gracious. \n\nAlong side myself is another full-timer, let\u2019s call her Laura. Laura is fresh out of college and this is her first big girl job. She is late every single day. Sometimes it\u2019s 45 minutes, but sometimes it\u2019s hours w/o any communication of when she\u2019ll be arriving. She also always leaves early. During our last shift she came to work 2.5 hours late and then lied in a Teams group chat about being there the whole time. Multiple people in our department witnessed her sneaking in as soon as she sent that message. Management asked her if she would be staying late or using PTO to make up for the lateness. She agreed w/ staying 2.5 hours late, then immediately told a co-worker in private that she was absolutely not staying late and knowingly lied. She also admitted that she would be using her boyfriend\u2019s badge (he works at the same facility) to badge out of the site so there wouldn\u2019t be a record of when she left. \n\nLaura has also bragged to multiple people about using PTO without actually logging it. She has taken 7 weeks of paid vacation since Jan 1. We don\u2019t have a direct manager at the moment. So that means we are currently reporting to our boss\u2019s boss\u2026 who already has way too much on their plate and no time to keep track of attendance. Which is why nobody notices that Laura isn\u2019t inputting her time off.\n\nWe have time sensitive tasks in the lab that can expire quickly. If Laura is on the schedule to test something but has already left early or is coming in late with no communication, we have to make someone else do the job she was scheduled for. It\u2019s also just kind of a slap in the face to our entire team of contractors for her to abuse benefits that are already incredibly gracious, and to brag about it to them as well?? Our entire team wishes she would resign so one of our hard working contractors could apply for the full time position. \n\nSomeone on our team has been tracking Laura\u2019s lateness since they joined the team 3 months ago and there has been 42 instances.. in 3 months! \n\nOther noteworthy instances: Laura recently took a 2 hour nap in her car during shift. A couple months ago, Laura calls out sick and posts a picture online at the bar. A contractor who had to pick up her tasks confronts her the next day, to which she says \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d\n\nMy question\u2026 WIBTA if I stopped minding my business and reported her to our company\u2019s integrity line? There would be an investigation of her badge in/outs, and they\u2019d likely just give her a warning.", "created_utc": 1689102569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x0e23/wibta_if_i_reported_a_coworker_for_never_being_at/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And good riddance, in this instance.\n\nThis girl Laura is setting a very bad example, because other, likeminded people, will notice that she gets away with breaking the rules, and they might try to do the same.\n\nAlso, it is extremely unfair to the co-workers who do take their jobs seriously, because they have to take up the slack.\n\nIn our company, we say that we, as HR and bosses, are not only responsible for the bottom line, but also for the wellbeing of our employees.\n\nFiring her would definitely promote that wellbeing.\n\nNTA, of course.", "NTA\n\nYou are making cancer drugs.

That suggests that either a) your senior manager is too busy to deal with it so let it slide due to lack of time to investigate, b) your senior manager isn't bothered by Laura's actions, or c) your senior manager is monitoring it to build up a case for dismissal without risking possibility of a claim of unfair dismissal. \n\nAnd YWNBTA. I appreciate it is frustrating when a colleague seems to get away without doing work - especially when it ends up being you picking up the slack."]}
