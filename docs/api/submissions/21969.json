All 40+ hours of the work week are 100% on-site, as there is no way to do our work from home. \n\nMy team is under 10 people, and most of those people are temp contractors who do not receive any benefits, which sucks since we are all doing the exact same work. Us actual employees get insane benefits. 180+ hours of PTO, unlimited sick time (they don\u2019t want you sick and around cancer drug products for obvious reasons). It\u2019s extremely gracious. \n\nAlong side myself is another full-timer, let\u2019s call her Laura. Laura is fresh out of college and this is her first big girl job. She is late every single day. Sometimes it\u2019s 45 minutes, but sometimes it\u2019s hours w/o any communication of when she\u2019ll be arriving. She also always leaves early. During our last shift she came to work 2.5 hours late and then lied in a Teams group chat about being there the whole time. Multiple people in our department witnessed her sneaking in as soon as she sent that message. Management asked her if she would be staying late or using PTO to make up for the lateness. She agreed w/ staying 2.5 hours late, then immediately told a co-worker in private that she was absolutely not staying late and knowingly lied. She also admitted that she would be using her boyfriend\u2019s badge (he works at the same facility) to badge out of the site so there wouldn\u2019t be a record of when she left. \n\nLaura has also bragged to multiple people about using PTO without actually logging it. She has taken 7 weeks of paid vacation since Jan 1. We don\u2019t have a direct manager at the moment. So that means we are currently reporting to our boss\u2019s boss\u2026 who already has way too much on their plate and no time to keep track of attendance. Which is why nobody notices that Laura isn\u2019t inputting her time off.\n\nWe have time sensitive tasks in the lab that can expire quickly. If Laura is on the schedule to test something but has already left early or is coming in late with no communication, we have to make someone else do the job she was scheduled for. It\u2019s also just kind of a slap in the face to our entire team of contractors for her to abuse benefits that are already incredibly gracious, and to brag about it to them as well?? Our entire team wishes she would resign so one of our hard working contractors could apply for the full time position. \n\nSomeone on our team has been tracking Laura\u2019s lateness since they joined the team 3 months ago and there has been 42 instances.. in 3 months! \n\nOther noteworthy instances: Laura recently took a 2 hour nap in her car during shift. A couple months ago, Laura calls out sick and posts a picture online at the bar. A contractor who had to pick up her tasks confronts her the next day, to which she says \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d\n\nMy question\u2026 WIBTA if I stopped minding my business and reported her to our company\u2019s integrity line?

You get canned from that job, apply to other similar jobs, and get exposed by your ex employer repeatedly. You can\u2019t fuck off at a job with this level of seriousness. \u201cYou\u2019re a snitch\u201d is dumb lol.", "Bless your heart. This post is indecipherable.", "You called it. She was referred by a director that works at a facility on the same campus as us, manufacturing a different drug product. That director is her dad\u2019s best friend. I didn\u2019t mention it because I wouldn\u2019t think that he would have sway at our building, but it\u2019s possible.", "I've had jobs where I found people doing shit that should 1000% get them fired, and despite me and 2 other people reporting them to multiple supervisors, they fired me instead. Blessing in disguise because that company sucked ass", "Seriously, both of them would be fired where I work. At best, the boyfriend would be put on strict supervision and any minor issue would result in termination. It would take a few weeks for the investigation but video recordings are really easy to verify.", "This. Don\u2019t worry about boss\u2019 boss having too much on their plate. This will inevitable become a bigger headache for them when they find out down the line and have to figure out what had been going on the whole time vs you just telling them.", "It took me forever to find out how to pronounce it. As far as I was concerned, it was E-Greg-reeas. Thank God I\u2019m an introvert and never said it in public.", "Report for sure. But also I would just stop picking up her slack. I get that you don't want to let things slip because you care about doing a good job. But next time there's a time sensitive thing assigned to Laura, can you just ... not do it? And then shit hits the fan and you say \"oh yes that was Laura's task, I guess she didn't do it.\" \n\nOr if that doesn't work, then just report it Every. Single. Time. \"Hi boss, just letting you know that Laura was assigned [task] that has to be done today, but she's gone so [coworker] is doing it instead.\" \n\nFactual, to the point, reporting each incident as it happens. The more you can stop covering for her and make it your boss's problem, it will become more of a pain for them NOT to deal with it.", "Do what is the plan here? Snitch for the third time? Your senior boss can take it out on you - you're basically saying, \"I told you twice already, and you did nothing.\" The right way is to stop picking up after her and see what happens when the work isn't done. \"Tests didn't get done? I did my tests and I don't know who didn't do theirs. Maybe attendance sheet can say.\"", "> She claimed she would look into the attendance thing but I haven\u2019t heard anything since\n\nThis happened at one of my previous employers.\n\n\"Manager Trainee Patrick\" was coming in late, hiding in the breakroom, not doing his job, fraternizing with those who should not be fraternized with, and all sorta of bad performance and poor decisions.\n\nI mentioned it to his Boss, and weeks later, nothing was done about it.\n\nSomeone else mentioned it, and again, nothing was done.\n\nWe discovered that the Boss was Patrick's Uncle.\n\nWe then collected more complaints from various employees with times/dates, etc. also dates of when we reported it to the Uncle Boss. We submitted that to the Uncles Boss.\n\nHe too, was related to the Uncle and Patrick.\n\nWord trickled down the grapevine, and we learned that **WE** would soon be terminated for spreading rumors and insubordination.\n\nCoincidentally, I was awaiting news of my transfer request to another location. I transferred out. While my friends were all fired in retaliation (three of them).\n\nIt took a while, but I was able to collect more evidence about Loser Patrick and his Boss Uncle. I submitted all that to Corporate Office. Invetigation was done. I was never told directly what happened, but (again) word trickled down the grapevine that bother Patrick and Uncle Boss were let go.", "You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the coworkers life.", "I don\u2019t even think it would take long to coordinate the video evidence as long as it\u2019s the only thing they\u2019re doing. I would compare the dates the coworkers said she was missing to his swipe log and check the cameras for when the two merry up", "I know a Greg that this fits. It's now my (mental) nickname for him.", "The plan is to go to HR\u2019s integrity line and put it in the corporate office\u2019s hands. The work has to get done. Patients (and the FDA) are counting on a quick turn around time for their immunotherapy.", "Bro that\u2019s still a god awful excuse Lmfao. They apparently do, because they saw pictures of her on social media at a bar and she said she doesn\u2019t care about getting caught. So yeah. Safe to say she\u2019s still in her \u201cPaRTyYyYYYY GUUuuUUuuUuUurLLLLL\u201d phase and only took this job because someone made her. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what goes on in her life\u201d is only excusable if she was open with her boss about family emergencies, medical issues, child support issues, car troubles, etc. that doesn\u2019t apply to a wino that hits the bottle more than she clocks in.", "'The work has to get done' must be the anthem of USA. If the work needs to be done, hire more people or control your workplace. Otherwise work clearly doesn't need to be done.", "I would hope that\u2019s the anthem of anyone involved in treatment of cancer. If not, that\u2019s concerning. And controlling the workplace is the entire motive of contacting HR, so I\u2019m confused at what you\u2019re trying to convey here.", "I'm saying it's up to your bosses to control the environment if they want the tests done, not dump it on some contractors or whatever. Since they are not controlling your workplace, means work doesn't need to be done. I would never pick up someone else's slack and stay over hours to do job that isn't mine. That's absurd."]}
