When you're involved in that sort of looked-down-on group it can make someone hyper-sensitive to anything that seems like it's in that realm. Polyam people are shit on a lot for their preferred relationship mode, even when they're doing it as ethically as any monogamous relationship, I have seen it happen to my polyam friends a lot.\n\nAn example of a situation that feels similar: I still remember 17 years later a conversation about a creepy person using lots of pseuds online and I said something like \"he, she, whatever they are\". The person next to me was a trans man who didn't actually know the history of what we we discussing as we'd launched right in assuming people did and was obviously uncomfortable with what I said. What I said was in no way a comment on trans people, but he didn't have the background to know why. \n\nSo, I absolutely agree that your friend's boundaries aren't the issue here, but if you do care about her as a friend I think it would be valuable to explain that you weren't talking about polyamorous people in general, but a specific misogynist religious sect who practice a form of it in a frequently totally fucked up way. You don't have to apologise, but it might be something you'd consider, that you didn't consider how it might feel like you were attacking a group she's a part of.\n\nHonestly, I fucking hate the \"monogamy is a tool of the patriarchy\" attitude about as much as I hate the \"anything other than monogamy is degenerate and wrong\" attitude, your friend should wake up and realise that humans are a spectrum, some people specifically inclined to one or the other, many others somewhere in between, but that's a whole other rant.", "I'm non-monogamous too but Mormon sister-wives are a different thing. If she's upset about the topic because it's \"harmful to enm\", she could have been a part of the conversation and compared experiences or something. Instead she just got offended for no reason. Also people who are non-monogamous are usually better at knowing what a boundary is as that's required reading in the community, and she has exhibited she doesn't, so I'm not sure your friend is really an expert on this anyway.", "Do you really believe people always tell you when they don't want to talk about things?

I am talking about her statement that OP wanted to sleep with the guy. That line sounds like a projection to me. She could have easily been uncomfortable with the topic. I acknowledge that.", "Sorry, are you saying you've been given the position of a false idol? Because who are you to give out punishment for G-ds will?", "it\u2019s really disgusting when people use religion as an excuse to abuse people. i\u2019m an active member of the mormon (not flds) church and hearing those stories sends a shiver down my spine", "Definitely, boundaries are meant to protect yourself but that doesnt mean everyone will follow every rule. So therefore to really protect yourself, you need to know when to remove yourself.", "Yes, I agree. Cannot stand people who literally create problems, purely to be like \"you hurt my feelings boohoo\". It's *so* fucking tiring.", "also finding the downvotes baffling, hell lets look at the most common place where \"set your boundries\" is, which is romantic relationships. If  you set the boundry as \"no kissing\". Your partner attempts to kiss you after you communicated that boundry, then it's clear they violated your boundry and you can decide if the relationship should even continue or not.\n\n\nAnother example would be say in a different world where OP was talking to that friend, that friend said she didn't want to talk about it, and OP were to follow the friend and continue to try to talk about the subject. \n\n\nSo yes in general boundries are generally about asking people to restrain their behavior... but it's completely unreasonable to set boundries to require them to change their behavior towards other people.", "I don\u2019t know why you got down voted. You\u2019re correct. \n\nBoundaries are for how other people act *to you *. So you\u2019re right. OP talking directly to friend A about the topic would make \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable talking about this\u201d an appropriate boundary. OP talking to someone *else* in front of friend A makes friend A saying \u201cI\u2019m uncountable talking about this\u201d not a boundary at all, since A could just leave the conversation. \n\nBoundaries *are* about other people\u2019s behavior, just not outside of it involving you.", "Yes, precisely. Boundaries are like lines drawn in the sand. When the line is drawn around yourself and your property, it's an appropriate boundary, but when you draw a line between other people and property that is not yours, it's not. Either way you are intending for people not to cross the line and exercising control is an appropriate way to remedy fair boundaries.\n\nControl is not inherently bad, you *should* be in control of your own boundaries and when you take steps to remedy a boundary being crossed, that's precisely what you are doing.\n\nSome boundaries can be remedied by removing yourself from a situation, but many can't once they've been crossed. Maintaining a level of deterrence is quite important.", "I mean, c'mon, it's *literally* the first rule\\~", "And there's also FLDS folks in Texas and Canada, and their primary town straddles the Utah/AZ border. Most live 5+ hours away from SLC.\n\nIt's a bit like asking someone from Philadelphia if they know Amish people.", "Happy pankake Tuesday", "I'm surprised I had to scroll far this far to see this take.\n\nThis is a probable ESH, just because the conversation itself was just icky (for lack of a better term), unless the cousin was happily playing along.", "Err you can be interested in learning about a topic without being involved with said topic. I feel like historians would all be considered awful people otherwise, lmao.", "Do you teach a class I can attend?", "Bingo", "Seeming so simple but so exactly on point. Very well said.", "Exactly. Another example of someone hearing therapy language but not understanding the meaning. She really thought she could set a \u201cboundary\u201d that controlled other people\u2019s behavior", "Im an exmo and this was my first thought. I was raised in the church.", "Go read \"Under the Banner of Heaven.\" Very insightful on how Mormon polygamy (and its surrounding culture) entraps women. It preys on young, uneducated girls, turning them into permanent housekeepers and child-producers.", "Ahh, how perfectly relevant! I forever love George Carlin.", "Doesn\u2019t Leviticus mandate murdering people for all sorts of behavior that is considered completely normal today? Like wearing two types of cloth at the same time? I\u2019m pretty sure Deuteronomy says women who lie about their virginity must be stoned to death. Seems like a rule about what other people can do, but I\u2019m no rabbi.", "It specifically refers to people who are children of Israel who should be punished for not following the rules they agreed to. So if people don't believe in religion, they aren't to be punished for not following rules they didn't agree to. Because when you follow G-d, you're agreeing to follow the rules, that's like the whole point in accepting to be G-d's people, when everyone else turned him down.\n\nBut otherwise yes, there are rules that are very outdated. Idk about the other religions but Judaism specifically has different sects for how closely the rules are followed, to account for that. I grew up a conservative Jew (conservative isn't the political kind lol) but I've been in reform synagogues since and it's more relaxed with rule following, and acknowledging times have changed. It's like the US following the rules that were made in 1776, amendments and new laws have to be added to adjust and account for changes in time. \n\nAssuming they're Christian or believe in Jesus, the old testament was essentially rendered moot when Jesus came and died for their sins, and the new testament is more closely followed.\n\nEdited to add information.\n\nHaha love the block because you don't like my answer. No, it's only for people breaking a rule they agreed to follow. There's no punishing people who don't follow rules they didn't agree to."]}
