As OP and you said saying she felt unconfirtable and was meaving for a while is totally fine (and a boundary) bjt her just getting to dictate what you can talk about is not, especially since no one was being abusive.", "She would have followed them and insisted on them stopping.\n\nShe told on herself with her accusations against OP \u2014 *she*\u2019s the one who was trying to hit on the guy, so she didn\u2019t want to leave the group he was in. She also possibly didn\u2019t really have a huge problem with the topic, other than it not being something she was able to participate in well.", "Her accusations against OP are a window into her own intentions. She was trying to hit on SLC guy and OP\u2019s conversation with him was getting in her way. So yes, a lot jealous.", "Boundaries are something you have for yourself and your sanity it\u2019s not to control other\u2019s behavior. Location is irrelevant.  You are completely within your rights to say if someone does x,y,z I will no longer be able to maintain a relationship with them. That\u2019s a boundary.  Stop talking about x,y,z topic right now because it makes me uncomfortable is trying to control other people\u2019s behavior.  Now if you are in a car and people are discussing things they know you aren\u2019t comfortable with you are well within your rights to break off the friendship or say I need some space because what happened in the vehicle made me uncomfortable.  You are not allowed to say you need to stop talking about this right now because I\u2019m uncomfortable that\u2019s not a boundary that\u2019s controlling other\u2019s behavior.  People need to stop conflating the two", "Comment-stealing bot?", "Bot. Comment stolen from EvolvingWren.", "I mean, sure, there is probably a more diplomatic way of phrasing a lesson in how boundaries work, but people with this controlling misunderstanding of boundaries are exasperating and sometimes impossible to deal with, so I understand OP\u2019s frustration.", "But it's not OP's job to teach his friend what boundaries are.", "I dunno..... if the tone of those comments wasn't overly snarky they're not so bad my first would have been similar to there are other conversations and coupled with a confused look and tone of voice. and your boundaries are irrelevant is no meaner than the smirking and barely suppressed laughing I would have done as I pointed out the definition of boundaries and maybe all around screwed my chances with salt lake city guy and maybe ruined a few other friendships by pointing out how idiotic she was being by simply not exiting the convo like any normal person at a party would do. And further arguing to be greeted with peels of laughter and the word snowflake.", "Thats exactly my view", "My take on this is the friend is trying to force them to change the subject, but just as she is free to leave, OP & the guy were also perfectly able to move a few feet away. So people are trying to fence, but no one actually is forcing anything on anyone. \n\nShould they have to? Absolutely NOT, especially if there is only 3 people in the group and only 1 is objecting to the subject matter. \n\nBut on the other hand, if it was a group of 10 people standing there, with only 2 interested in the conversation - than yes, they are the ones who should physically move a away, since at least one person objected & no one else was participating.", "Buzzword bingo!", "No, they are not about controlling other people's behaviour in any way. If you yell at or hit me - boundaries for most people- I will remove myself from your vicinity. (Unless it's my home, then you have to go.) Boundaries are about preserving one's self/psyche. If something threatens those, you have to have a plan to save yourself, not to bend other people to your will.", "I\u2026don\u2019t understand what that has to do with your conversation. Is she pro-polygamy? Is she pro-*Mormon* polygamy? Is she of the belief that polygamy is some sort of patriarchy-less system? What about this conversation challenged her beliefs in a way that made her so uncomfortable she wanted to forbid *everyone* from talking about it?", "Wow thanks judge, jury and executioner!", "Lol", "I know it\u2019s not. and I did say that. but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t show extra compassion and help them. no one is obligated to, believe me, I know. & maybe she wasn\u2019t frozen in place. I wasn\u2019t there. I was just offering potential insight as someone with PTSD. it\u2019s never a black and white situation is all :)", "There was an old George Carlin bit about people complaining about hearing offensive material: \"Hey Reverend, don't you realize there are two knobs on the receiver? One turns down the volume DOWN and the other changes the channel!\"", "We don't talk about Fight Club", "No you can't. That's bs", "Of course it isn\u2019t OP\u2019s job, but people are typically at least nice to their friends. This is still a NTA situation from what OP disclosed, but there\u2019s definitely a nice way to have it with a friend vs a way to have it with an annoying stranger.", "No, she\u2019s not. Monogamy is just one of many ways that humans like to build relationships with each other. \n\nYou could make a case for *compulsory, heterosexual* monogamy being a \u201ctool of the patriarchy,\u201d but that\u2019s a bit different, no?", "As someone else with ptsd I find it extremely harmful to assume others have it and to overuse the word trigger the way it has. It makes me uncomfortable when people do that. It\u2019s also not on other people to make me feel comfortable it\u2019s on me", "And then what? You become the conversation police? \"Psst - Mary!! Those people are talking about horse racing again!\" Like anyone would come to another party at that house!!", "The situation I was thinking of, we were all seated around the dining table playing a game together, so there was no out of earshot. They were asked to change the subject, they didn't, and I ended up leaving the game", "Depends on what the topic is. For example, I don't allow guests in my house to describe car accidents they've heard about or seen when I'm in the room, because it can trigger PTSD flashbacks to a traumatic accident I was in. If that makes me an unpopular host, then so be it. My home should be a safe place for me, especially since everywhere else isn't guaranteed to be.", "I will be a more popular host if I don't allow racist, sexist or homophobic conversations at my events actually \n\nI'm not going to be more ignorant because I won't entertain people who hate me and my other guests", "Most people don't have a problem with opinions that are simply different they have a problem with opinions that are malevolent.", "Correct, people are typically nice and she wasn't. I don't care if you're my friend or not, how you approach me is how I'm gonna respond to you.", "Oh embrace the rabbit hole my friend.  \nThere's a show on TLC called sister wives and,  I don't want to spoil anything but, the fans are getting payoff from 16 seasons of bs right now and it's delicious.", "'nooooo im supposed to bang a bunch of guys then marry someone for stability'", "a sister-wife is what the women in polygamous marriages call each other.  They are sisters-in-marriage.  There is a television program in the US called 'Sister Wives' about the realities  of a polygamous marriage, which is probably what OP was referring to when she asked the guy if he had run into any of the 'sister-wives' people.\n\nHope that helps :)", "well in this case, I\u2019m addressing all angles because I don\u2019t actually know these people. so ofc assumptions have to be made or people will address all angles based on the context we are given. this is why you take things with a grain of salt on reddit. I\u2019m not saying to assume anything if a situation arises. I\u2019m making my comments based on what I know. an irl situation would be different because I would know the people involved, the full context, etc. my fianc\u00e9 knows I have PTSD and would help me if triggered. same can apply if you fully the know the situation in another context. my comment isn\u2019t to cater to you", "I've been in homes where \"don't talk about religion or politics\" isn't just advice, it's enforced. The hosts wouldn't know unless voices were being raised or something, in which case the need for the rule was kinda evident.", "Well, if one of the hosts or even guest is a recovering gambling addict, that would indeed be a valid rule that many would understand. Just like if it was a kids party and someone started talking about how they were pretty sure there was a parent at school with an OF, you could ask them to shelve the conversation or leave. It all depends on the topics, the situation, and if the other guests respect the hosts position.\n\nIn this case OP is NTA, the friend was NOT the host and should have left if she didn't want to hear the topic. This situation was a bit ridiculous but saying no one can ask that certain conversations be avoided if there are valid reasons are a bit much.", "I'll also add in anything objectively gross and won't stop talking about it. (Had friends in college that were considering medical school and REALLY liked talking about surgeries they watched online in graphic detail).", "They also use it frequently in this sub if you say something they don\u2019t like or you disagree with them.", "I lived with real gaslighting in an abusive relationship, and I wouldn't wish it on ANYONE.", "just a point of info: majority of mormons don\u2019t practice polygamy and haven\u2019t for over a hundred years, however there is a population of flds people who broke off from the mormon church and they still practice polygamy.

Thanks!", "MerMAN, father! MerMAN!", "I will add slur, while the kids are in earshot", "many of the people who practice polygamy now are part of the flds church which broke off from the mormon church about 150 years ago, and salt lake city is sort of the epicenter of the mormon church, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s related. there are a few different polygamist colonies in utah", "Someone got lucky today, huh", "> Idk why they gotta make something weird even weirder with the family association lol\n\nI suspect that it's a reference to the old idea of people actually joining a family through marriage. The wives are sisters-in-law and wives, so sister-wives."]}
