He said \"massive assholes and total creeps.\" I asked for more info, but one of our friends interrupted and said the conversation was making her uncomfortable. I figured that was her telling us she was leaving the conversation to talk to someone else, but she didn't do that. I continued to ask for more info, and he explained more what he meant, and she interrupted again. She said the conversation was making her really uncomfortable and asked us to please talk about something else.\n\nI told her there were a lot of other conversations going on she could join, and we could chat again later. I said I was really interested in the topic from the point of view of someone who lived near that kind of community and wanted to hear more. She said it was a boundary for her. I said her boundaries are irrelevant to my conversations because she doesn't have to participate. She went to talk to someone else at that point.\n\nI hadn't talked to her since Saturday, but she sent me a text today. She said what I did really damaged her trust in me and changed the way she views me as a person. She accused me of wanting to sleep with that guy and said I was cruel to her just to impress him.

My therapist taught us that boundaries are a set standard of what you will do in a certain situation, but they cannot describe what another person will or must do. \"You will not call me names in a fight\" =/= a boundary. \"If you call me names during a fight, I will not engage further and will leave the situation\" = a boundary. A boundary can only define your own actions. What she demands is that everyone around her cater to her. Some heavy protagonist syndrome there. I would day you should have a hard time trusting her now and she really changed how you see her, as now she's shown that other people don't matter to her and that she only sees others as accessories or extensions of herself.", "forget it, she shouldn't be offended.
