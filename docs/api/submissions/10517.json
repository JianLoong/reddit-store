But the response was posted when this was first posted. And it's a valid question.", "Sister wife is actually related to how the wives view *each other.* So a lesbian relationship would be out of the question between wives because it would be like sleeping with a sister. The association with incest is part of the point.", "NTA, you're correct.\n\nA boundary is about your own behavior, not about somebody else's.  \"You don't get to talk about X in my presence' isn't a boundary.  \"If people are talking about X, I will go find somewhere else to be during that conversation' is a boundary.  Hell, \"I will not maintain a relationship with anybody who talks about X\" is a boundary.\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of weaponized terminology.  No, you don't get to tell people what to do and make it retroactively OK to be controlling by calling it a 'boundary' or 'a mental health necessity.'\n\nFrom one of your comments:\n\n> No, but she's into all that \"monogamy is a tool of the patriarchy\" stuff.\n\nTo her, 'tool of the patriarchy' is anything she doesn't like, but doesn't want to need to defend or justify.\n\nOh, and by the way, if somebody accuses you of wanting to fuck a person, especially if they're acting as an unrequested chaperone, it's because they, themselves, want to fuck the person.", "Nta Yeah giving an ultimatum is not setting boundaries that\u2019s toxic. Almost like a girlfriend saying you can\u2019t talk to girls.", "Nta. Now that people know the term \"boundaries\" they use it like some kind of wild card. You are 100% correct. She could have moved to another conversation if she was uncomfortable. It's not like she was in a car or at work sitting next to you. It's weird that she accused you of trying to sleep with her cousin. There are some serious underlining issues that she is dealing with that goes beyond the topic of sister wives. She sounds jealous.", "The perfect response to your friend is to send her the link to this thread.", "And here I am just wanting to know what are these \"sister-wife guys\". Pls OP share your newfound knowledge on the subject with me lol.", "NTA. Dictating someone else's conversation is not a \"boundary\", it's a demand. An entitlement. Her actual boundaries are, of course, relevant, as are anyone's... But this isn't that. It isn't a boundary. You don't get to unilaterally decide what topics others can discuss and then claim it's a boundary and more than you can dictate what cuisines other people eat and call that boundaries. Your 'friend\" is apparently under the impression that the world revolves around her and what she wants.", "NTA. I wish more people had your (CORRECT) understanding of boundaries.\n\nYour boundaries are yours. You can\u2019t place them on other people. You only control your behavior to your boundary.\n\nSo, Mom insists on talking about how you moved away in full pity mode? You tell her once, maybe twice, you won\u2019t engage with that. When she brings it up, you apply your boundary: change the topic, walk away, hang up, etc\n\nYour friend could have applied her boundary by walking away. She needs to mature to get that. \n\nBut some folks never get to that point. Sad, too, because they miss out on the Sister-Wives tea!", "NTA- Sounds more like you took this guy's attention away from her so she got pissy about it and made up these \"boundaries\"", "NTA! Boundaries are for the person making them, not for other people! If her boundary was that she will not participate in conversations that make her uncomfortable then it was on her to remove herself from the conversation, not on you to stop having it! This wasn't an environment where she was forced to stay. She has a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of \"boundaries\". Based on the title I was expecting a different result but in this case 100% NTA.", "NTA If a conversation at a party is making you uncomfortable then join another.  Someone's boundaries don't censor others conversations.  She sounds entitled and rude especially after doubling down by saying that you want to sleep with him just because you wanted to continue an interesting conversation.", "NTA. Tell her the door is a boundary. Don\u2019t let it hit her on her way out.", "\n>She accused me of wanting to sleep with that guy and said I was cruel to her just to impress him.\n\nYou found a way to connect and talk to the guy, she didn't. Sounds like she is projecting what she wanted to do onto you and was trying to shut the conversation down before (in her head) she lost he chance. \n\nNTA", "NTA. People don\u2019t what boundaries even are. Thank you, pop culture. My boundary is that everyone who talks TJ me has to give me $5.

If my personal boundaries are challenged by someone having a conversation I'm not a part of, I walk away. Simple as that. My boundaries are preserved and they get to continue their conversation. If it was a bigoted conversation I might stick my oar in but sounds like you were curious and not being offensive.\n\nI have noticed some people asserting their boundaries be respected without question while totally disrespecting the people around them. When boundaries are incompatible, a lot of people don't know how to process it and resort to anger, much the way your friend did.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong imho", "NTA\nThis is silly.", "LE GASP?!

I count!\"", "NTA she should\u2019ve walked away, it\u2019s not hard. She just needed it to be all about her for a moment.", "My brother tries to pull that crap all the time. He walks into a conversation that doesn't involve him and isn't about him and demands we change the subject.  When I refuse he stomps off.  He used to delight in having conversations that grossed me out and made me leave so he can deal with it.", "NTA. but she clearly needed some extra compassion in the moment and maybe guidance to a new convo (seems silly but she could have been triggered & frozen in place, having a hard time leaving the situation). it\u2019s her job to manage those triggers in the given situation esp since she wasn\u2019t apart of the convo, but sometimes people get stuck in paralysis.\n\ni\u2019m not sure the setting, but maybe you guys could have moved away from her too if it resolved the situation. she can\u2019t assert a boundary like that on you but she also can\u2019t help feeling triggered by convos like that", "Nta, but! Was she speaking to him first as in interested on him? I guess I'm asking if you cock-blocked her?", "NTA boundaries are personal, they arent there to control people but rather protect ones mental health. its up to the person who has the boundary to enforce it by removing themselves from the situation, instead of trying to control the situation to better suit them", "NTA. Ugh. These types of people. Friend's best suited for your rear view mirror. Otherwise you're constantly just trying to meet their level of expectations that are unrealistic and selfish.", "So what if OP DID want to sleep with the guy? Was the friend trying to dictate that too, along with what people can talk about? \n\nWas she involved in this as some point in her life? Sounds like she needs to work on that, not you. NTA", "NTA. She can't dictate other people's conversation topics.", "were you rude about it? maybe? but imma say nta she didnt need to be apart of the conversation but she doesnt get to stop someone from having the conversation because she doesn't like it thats not how talking works she sounds immature", "Wait so how was it hooking up with that guy", "Tbh I think ESH. You easily could\u2019ve just changed the topic and continued the conversation later, she could\u2019ve just left to talk with someone else.

Which was not the case here.", "I was all ready to read the riot act, but... surprisingly, NTA.
