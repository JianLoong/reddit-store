My boys were with my husband at a hockey tournament when this occurred. I asked my daughter a few weeks ago if she wanted to babysit her sisters for the day last weekend while I ran errands.  She declined despite knowing she would be paid her usual rate of $18 an hour PLUS the usual movie gift card if her sisters had a good time(about $50). And said, \"No, I'm going to a friend's house.\" I said that's fine and was going to cancel my plans. I can't watch kids without a babysitter. \n\nA couple of days later, I received a call from one of my daughters friends asking if I still needed a babysitter. I said yes, and she said that she wanted to start babysitting on the side and if it would be ok if I let her do it.  I said absolutely, and if it goes well, she can be my go-to if my daughter doesn't want to do it and offered her the same rate of my daughter $18 an hour plus the movie giftcard if the girls want her to come back and I'd leave a review for her on whatever app she wanted to use to get other gigs. She agreed.  Now to the part where AM I the Asshole steps in. I was gone all day Saturday (like I do once a month (like 9am to 5pm). \n\nSo when I got home I paid my daughter's friend, the girls loved her and said she does far more than my daughter with them and want her again whenever im gone on Saturdays because she to quote the four year olds \"actually plays with us and isn't on the phone all day.\" I asked what they meant, and they explained how my daughter brings them to McDonald's at lunch to tell me lies about what we do together and how their sister lets them do naughty things as long as they clean it up. Of course I explained to the kids that we can't lie about what we do with babysitters because sometimes bad things happen and mommy needs to know right away. They said ok and continued playing. \n\nSo my daughter comes home a couple of hours later after convo with dad about punishment, we both agreed she's not going to babysit the girls if she's that irresponsible. So I called my daughters friend and said she has a permanent babysitting gig with us if she wants it and she agreed. \n\nMy daughter came home and I sat her down after the other kids went to sleep with my husband. We both explained what the girls told us and we would like to hear her side of the story and she confirmed everything the 4yr olds said. So we said she's fired from babysitting the kids. She LOST IT. And called us unfair and that we're assholes. Being a teenager she posted it on tiktok and it gained a bit of traction including from other parents saying what we did was unfair.

You didn't get the results you were looking for and someone else provided those results. She kind of wrecked other opportunities for babysitting other people's kids by posting about the drama online, IMHO. Maybe you can find other payable tasks for her to do if you have the funds, since I'm guessing that's mainly why she was upset. To be fair, since they're all sisters, I'm sure that's why she was lenient, because that's just how siblings are. Don't hold it against her for too long. Congrats on finding an awesome babysitter, though!", "NTA. You hire a babysitter to care for your kids and be responsible with them. Not ignore them & bribe them to lie to you. Your daughter was irresponsible and let them do \u201cnaughty things\u201d, and depending on what those are, could have put them in a hazardous situation. With that many kids to look after, anything can happen and she needed to have her full attention on them. \nShe\u2019s just learned a valuable ($18/hr\u2019s worth) lesson that there are consequences for her actions, or in this case, non-action. If this were a real-world job, she would have been fired. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t worry about what other people have to say about it (especially on TikTok \ud83d\ude44), people will take any opportunity to parent-shame you no matter what you do. You & your husband discussed and decided what was an appropriate response and it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business what goes on in your house.", "Of course you are NTA! Your daughter was being paid to do a job and instead she told your kids to lie to you. If any other person in your employ did what she did, of course you would fire them. This is a no-brainer. She has completely violated your trust when it comes to the care of the kids and teaching them to lie to their parents about what their babysitter told them? Yeah, not cool at all.", "NTA, she was irresponsible and you fired her. She fucked around and found out.\n\nThe only \u201cfault\u201d i could find was that you didn\u2019t explain to her (as a parent) that she will be fired if she did her job badly. But she would\u2019ve learned that in life anyway", "NTA. Why would you pay anyone to do a job they clearly don't really want to do & aren't doing a good job at?", "NTA, and moreover it is a good punishment as it is a natural consequence of her actions. Poor babysitting = no more babysitting jobs.", "NTA. This is a valuable life lesson for your daughter - fuck off on the job and you\u2019ll likely lose that job. As for other commenters and such, who cares what they think? Social media isn\u2019t real life and their opinion (based on one biased side of the story) should mean absolutely zero to you. Don\u2019t even read them.", "NTA if she is not only not willing to be consistently available, AND isn't putting forth the proper effort expected of her for the job, then she shouldn't be surprised when she is replaced if a better candidate comes along. This is kinda how the real life workforce works. If it had been something like she was doing perfectly fine but the friend was willing to accept less payment to do the same job then you would have been in the wrong, but as it is definitely NTA.", "NTA your daughter right now doesn't seem responsible enough she had a chance and she blew it and yeah it sucks for her but she's got to learn.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She would have been fired from a job with a company over these actions.", "NTA. You need someone reliable and responsible.", "NTA. You are not been unfair, you are been a responsable parent. Every father Who as in her side its not a good father. If you are not gonna do your job right, you can be fired. You need someone responsable Who take care of your childrens and your daughter its not that person. She need to be more mature if she wanna have your trusth again to babysitting again for you.", "NTA her choices, her consequences.", "NTA, and probably a good time to have a parent -child talk on \u201cdigital footprints\u201d unless she posted that story anonymously on tiktok.", "NTA. \n\nI think it\u2019s a little bizarre to pay an older child to watch younger siblings anyway. \n\nSeems healthier all around to just pay someone who wants to work. \n\nAnd 16 is old enough to get a part time job. She will probably appreciate the situation she had with you, once she\u2019s out in the real world making minimum wage and no gift cards.", "You never gave her the opportunity to correct the behavior, and she wasn't unsafe with them, just lazy. You're not an raging asshole, but consider what you just taught her. She might completely avoid talking to you now about things she's going through because you treating her like you're her boss, not her mother.  I think you're being unduly harsh on your eldest.", "NTA.  She fucked around and found out.  But I think the punishment was a little harsh.  I believe in second chances, especially for kids.  Maybe you can say she's fired for the next month, and then she can have another chance to prove herself?  She has a higher standard to live up to now that the twins know what a good babysitter looks like -- give her a chance to live up to it.", "Slight yta. You didn't say she was doing anything dangerous, just sorta not focused on them  and You didn't give her an opportunity to fix her behavior and she is your daughter... The thing is, this  isn't a real babysitting gig to her, as much as it is to you. These are her sisters. So of course she is more lazy than a normal babysitter. I used to watch my brother and you couldn't expect me to be as active as I was with my other gigs. Because my brother was mine and I was used to him. You can't expect her to be as involved as anyone else you pay. But, maybe make the babysitting jobs shorter. So, full day jobs go to the other girl and a few hours or short ones go to your daughter. Tell her what you expect from her. Be clear.", "Your daughter is around those kids all the time. Of course she's not going to be playing with them constantly - do you? She takes them to MDonalds and is lenient with them, but makes them clean their messes. I'm not seeing the issue, but you weren't clear on what \"naughty\" meant. The twins are enamoured of the new sitter - that won't last. Plus you emabarrassed her by telling a peer she had a permanent babysitting job, effectively letting her know your daughter was out of the job. Seems very harsh. YTA for going nuclear v. punishing/providing a second chance.", "Can we watch the tiktok??", "no", "NTA - she learn a valuable lesson.  if you have a PT gig and give somebody else the opportunity to fill in for you , they might do a better job and you loose the gig", "NTA. You were completely fair about this entire situation. You even gave your daughter the chance to speak up and she was honest which is great but not what you're looking for so you did what any parent should do.", "We did explain to her when she started babysitting last year that it would happen. Which is why I think the McDonald's came into play.", "The daughter knew what she was doing was wrong though because she lied about it and told the girls to lie about it. If the daughter was getting typical sibling babysitting rates then maybe she deserves a chance to apologize and do things right, but $18/hr plus $50 to sit on her phone the whole time? Yes, mom was boss because she was paying an actual wage,", "You don't give second opportunities to people that teach your childen to lie and keep secrets.", "It is not like the daughter came and fussed up. Instead she lied to her mom and actively encouraged and bribed the little girls to lie to her as well. Does not seem like they were on the honesty path here anyway. Not sure why you think this would make daughter less likely to talk to her mom in the future", "Here's the thing, I would if the things the kids told us were minor like \"she let's us play with the sand inside\" but it was things like she let's us watch The Quiet Place, and she just sits on her phone the whole time.", "I didn't expect her to play with them constantly, but they would say things like \"she took us to the park or the zoo\" versus not and they admitted she let them watch movies like The Quiet Place and she played on her phone all day and didn't actually \"watch\" them. I also explained to her that teaching them to lie for McDonald's was wrong.", "I don't actually know \"The Quiet Place\" to know how in appropriate it is, but are the girls having nightmares from it?  Seems like it wasn't really a big problem if this is the only way you found out about it.  \"Sits on her phone the whole time\" is where she's going to have to live up to the standard her friend set for a good babysitter if you give her a second chance.  Sit down and have a chat with her about expectations and if she still wants the job, she gets one chance to live up to them.", "Got it. Changing to NTA. Still not sure firing v. punishing/providing a second chance was the way to go, but encouraging the twins to lie, ignoring them and letting them watch scary movies certainly shows poor judgment. I hope your daughter finds another way to make spending money as babysitting clearly isn't her thing. I'm sure she's figured out by now she ruined a relatively easy, lucrative job for herself.", "No, she actively encouraged and bribed the little girls to lie to their mom. This is Extremely bad! It is not just she was on her phone the whole time. She was encouraging them to do whatever they wanted as long as they left her alone and kept their mouths shut. She does NOT deserve a \"second chance\"", "If she endangered her sisters, she definitely shouldn't get a second chance.  If she just expected them to entertain themselves much of the time, IMO that's different. There's clearly something in the middle going on here because she let the kids do things she believed Mom might not approve of, and bribed them to keep their mouths shut about it. If these are things that endangered the kids, OP hasn't been clear about that.\n\nI'm guessing that much of the time when Mom is responsible for the twins, she expects them to entertain themselves while she does something else.  Most childcare experts say teaching a child to entertain herself is developmentally appropriate at that age and healthy for the child.  \n\nIf Mom expect the babysitter to actively play with the 4-year-olds for 8 hours straight, that's something that needs to be discussed in advance.  Generally babysitting is about keeping the kids safe, happy, and doing things that are developmentally appropriate.    \n\nThe daughter lacked judgment here for sure, but this doesn't sound like something she could not correct, and it doesn't sound like she let the kids do anything dangerous or so egregious that she shouldn't be given a second chance.", "NTA. This is a job. Not a charity.", "NTA. You found a better sitter. End of story. Tell your daughter that you will \"give her another chance\" as a backup sitter in the event that your regular sitter is unavailable.", "NTA- These kids are 4 and could get into a lot of things that could cause harm. Your daughter was lucky they didn't and bribed them to lie about her babysitting abilities. My daughter found out the hard way of not paying attention while babysitting. Our twins had learned about matches, not that we had a lot in the house but enough that they knew how to use them. They almost started a house fire, it was put out in time but the paint on the wall bubbled up. After that she didn't leave anything to chance anymore and did the job properly.", "NTA", "NTA.  Naughty things means she is teaching the younger ones to disrespect your boundaries and to lie to their parents.  You would be very silly and irresponsible to allow that to continue.  Hope she learns something valuable from this.", "Plus I highly doubt daughter is being truthful on tiktok or else other parents wouldn't be agreeing with her.", "That\u2019s very true.", "Definitely not something appropriate for a four year old."]}
