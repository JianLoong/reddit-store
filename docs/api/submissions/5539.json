I think most relationships could benefit from transparency and honest conversations.  Your mom was probably embarrassed and a bit shook from her own daughter asking her to behave herself at Christmas and decided to get offended instead of reflecting on her own behavior.

If she can\u2019t agree to such simple terms, uninvite her if you like.\n\nSeriously, well done having a tough talk with your folks in an effort to give your family the peaceful Christmas they deserve.

Keep those boundaries firm and if anyone starts the arguing ask them to leave.

Unfortunately, she sounds a bit like my mom; taking perceived negative things as an attack or a slight against her, even when it is so clearly not.

If someone doesn't like it, they can excuse themselves from celebrating. \n\nI think bringing things up beforehand was a mature decision on your part.
