Laura never really got along with Mary or Harry but she always was quite respectful. Also, they came into our lives when she was already in college, which meant she didn't get to bond with either of them.\n\nLaura is bisexual, I always have loved her as she is. She had relationships with both men and women over these past few years, but none of them were prominent enough to require them meeting me. That is, until she brought home a girlfriend of hers this year. She was with us from morning till the evening.\n\nLaura's girlfriend (32F) was polite and quiet through the whole time she was with us, brought lovely presents, didn't talk to anyone much, and she wasn't at all attentive or warm towards Laura either. Her phone rang a few times and she went off to answer (she's a prominent businesswoman). \n\nAfter she left, Mary told Laura that she was a little cold and distant overall, and that Laura deserved someone who could give her more of her time and affection.

Meeting your girlfriend's father is a huge deal. You don't know anything about her, and it sounds like you're already passing judgment. I'd be nervous, too.\n\nMary should mind her own business. It's not her place, and her opinion wasn't asked for (neither was yours).", "YTA. You don't know anything about the girlfriend and are already passing judgement? I would wager you were kept away from the other significant others for similar behavioral issues and boundary crossing.\n\nApologize to your daughter and offer to spend more time with the girlfriend to truly get to know her.", "Yta. Youre judging her girlfriend over one interaction. \n\n>she wasn't at all attentive or warm towards Laura either.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that she's purposely not being warm towards her because, as a queer woman, showing affection in front of her partners parents could be potentially dangerous? Queer people never know how someone is going to react to seeing them affectionately interact.", "YTA. You barely know the girlfriend and she might have been distant because of nerves or being in a new environment. Also not everyone shows affection in the same way, or feels comfortable doing so in front of strangers they just met. \n\nThen there the added layer of internalised homophobia. You don't know if her girlfriend has supportive family growing up or the messages she heard and this could absolutely effect how public she is with affections - if you read stories of gay couples being beat up for holding hands you automatically don't do that outside your own home by default.", "YTA. You and your wife are wrong to judge your daughter's partner so harshly after the first meeting. She doesn't seem to have done anything wrong, just not behaving in a way that would immediately appeal to you and your wife.\n\nYou should have trusted your daughter's judgment on this, and given yourselves a chance to get to know her partner properly. You've now done irreparable damage to your relationship with your daughter. Hope it was worth it in order to bad-mouth a person you've only just met.", "YTA you and Mary are both the Asshole. Your daughter is happy and loves her gf and y'all go around judging their interactions when you first meet the girlfriend. She might have been super nervous. Or she is just quiet in general. Maybe she didn't like you. Either way, you and Mary suck. Apologize to your daughter.", "YTA. One evening with the woman is not enough to make that judgment. Many people are not comfortable in new situations and do not show open affection when in the company of strangers. And there is a double stranger situation here as well, since your daughter doesn\u2019t know your wife all that well either. \n\nConsidering that your daughter is dating the woman, both of you ought to be trusting her a bit more on this and should have been a bit more reticent on sticking your noses into her relationship. Bluntly, your wife *was* rude, and so were you for backing her.", "YTA.\n\nLaura's an adult. If it's been nine months, she has a better sense of her relationship than you do. Some people are more reserved in public and affectionate in private and their partners are fine with that. Other times people just aren't demonstrative but show love in other ways. And again, that's fine so long as their partners are fine with it. At any rate, it's not to role of a distant stepmother to be advising her on her relationship after knowing her partner for a day.", "YTA as is your wife - Yes you two mean well.  BUT Laura didn't ask Mary's opinion, she didn't ask yours.  Since Mary's not all that close - if she was that concerned she should have talked to you and had you bring it up in private. \n\nYour daughter cares about this GF enough to bring her home - she's the 1st person you've met.  THAT is a big deal.  \n\nRealize that you just met this woman.  Not every family is warm & welcoming to same sex relationships.  She may have been more reserved about being affectionate with Laura in front of you all because she doesn't know/trust you yet.  She could have had some bad experiences with past GFs families.  Also some people maybe be lovey dovey in private but not into PDA.  \n\nAs for the phone - unfortunately if she's got a high position she's stuck taking calls even during the holidays.\n\nApologize to your daughter for over stepping; if she and GF are happy together that's what's important, and you promise you & Mary will butt out unless she asks for an opinion.", "I know you think you're looking out for your daughter here, but take a step back and recognize what it's like to meet someone's parents, particularly when you're not a straight man. Also, she's under no obligation to be affectionate in her relationships, even without the discomfort of someone's parents being right there. You've pretty effectively invalidated your daughter's relationship with the person who probably is currently her biggest supporter.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Sorry, but speaking as a bisexual woman your daughter\u2019s age, gay (especially bisexual) relationships are still frowned upon in a lot of places and there are plenty of horror stories here on reddit to back that up. Meeting an S/O\u2019s family is a big step and can be extremely stressful even for heterosexual couples. Being bisexual and being the first S/O to meet the parents; holy hell that\u2019s a lot of pressure from the girlfriend\u2019s perspective. \n\nYou have no idea what is going on with this woman or why she was being distant. She could have had a rough holiday, or her job is having complications, a problem with a family member, or simply she could be shy. You met her a whole one time. This woman was sincere enough to  bring you and your wife gifts before even meeting you. She has not done anything wrong other than be quiet and polite. She may not feel comfortable showing public displays of affection around her new girlfriend\u2019s father. Additionally, Some people just aren\u2019t publicly affectionate by nature. \n\nYour wife isn\u2019t Laura\u2019s mother, nor is she bisexual. Considering how late she came into the picture, she should not be having any opinions when it comes to your daughter\u2019s relationship period. Especially if she hasn\u2019t she built a relationship with Laura first. Your wife was absolutely being rude by essentially telling Laura her girlfriend isn\u2019t good enough for her, and that she deserves someone better (by your wife\u2019s standards) while the girlfriend was taking a work call in another room. Are you kidding me? She couldn\u2019t even wait for them to leave before throwing down her judgement, where she had no say to begin with. What if her girlfriend overheard? \n\nYour daughter trusted you by bringing her person around and you effectively did the worst thing possible. You and your wife owe Laura and her girlfriend a genuine apology. Read the whole book before you judge the cover.", "Did she ask either of you for your opinions? If your wife just blurted out that she didn't like her girlfriend, and you agreed with her, then I can see why she's not talking to you.\n\nYour wife, who you admit has no relationship with her, just stated her opinion, without any justification? You can't see how that would hurt your daughter?\n\nYTA (and your wife)", "YTA. Opinions should only be offered when requested, and as you've seen there can be something wrong with freely offering what you think. People can get offended.", "YTA, you met the girlfriend once and only for a few hours.  She could be shy or its hard for her to be comfortable meeting her girlfriends father.  You can't give an opinion or defend an opinion when you have no real mat and bones reason to dislike the girlfriend besides for her not being overly friendly.  \n\nIs she nice to your daughter?  Is your daughter happy?  That is hat matters", "Sorry, buddy, but YTA here.\n\nYou need to take into account what you witnessed can perfectly be the kind of interaction they are actually comfortable with, and it doesn't mean that's the only way the interact with each other. Some couples can be seen as cold in front of others while being very warm and passionate in their privacy.\n\nJust don't make a big deal out of this and apologize to your daughter.", "YTA, Mary offered advice and an opinion that wasn\u2019t asked for. Laura is and adult who appears to be mature enough to make her own decisions and it isn\u2019t about pleasing you or Mary who is also an AH for thinking she has the right to say what she said.", "Yeah, YTA along with your wife.\n\nMary elected to drop unwanted relationship advice and tell your daughter that her 9 month GF wasn't good enough and how they needed to breakup.\n\nI can understand why that pissed your daughter off when she brought her over to meet. And if she's a businesswoman, answering the phone is normal. I wonder if the same observation would have been an issue if she was male?\n\nYou defending your wife seems a snap hip judgement, which I get. But again, you defended Mary prying into and meddling into Laura's personal business.", "YTA. You and your wife judged Laura's girlfriend pretty harshly and that immediately put Laura in a defensive position. Sometimes it can take people time to warm up to others, especially in situations like this where you're meeting your significant other's family for the very first time and feeling nervous. \n\nAlso, just so you're aware, people in same-sex relationships might instinctively be more formal and guarded when in the presence of others and refrain from showing any affection to their partner because, unfortunately, it isn't always safe to do so. I'm not saying that they felt unsafe around you, only that this is something they might have a tendency to do in general.\n\nThe fact that she took the time and effort to pick out \"lovely gifts\" for all of you shows that Laura's girlfriend *does* care to make a good impression on you. You and your wife should both apologize to Laura for being so hard on her girlfriend before you've even gotten a chance to really get to know her.", "Judging from the way you described Laura\u2019s GF being quiet, maybe that\u2019s just how she is? She isn\u2019t into public displays of affection or was nervous meeting you for the first time. \n\nDon\u2019t judge too harshly on the first meeting, give it time. Also, you don\u2019t know how she is behind closed doors, maybe she\u2019s as attentive as you want her to be, just in a private setting where she doesn\u2019t feel like she being judged.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot judge someone's whole personality and their relationship in one stressful meeting.\n\nYour wife doesn't get to decide how much affection is the right amount for your daughter and her partner to be happy with. Neither do you.\n\nFor christs sake can't you remember the pressure of meeting your partners parents for the first time, stick christmas stress on top of that.  Add on the fact that Laura's GF knows it's the first time you've met your daughters GF before.\n\n\nShe brought nice presents, she came even though busy at work. She was polite, and didn't overtake the conversation.\n\n\nWhat more do you want? Seriously? What more did you want?\n\nDo you not get that this reaction of yours is more to do with the fact that this is the first GF of hers you've met?\n\nIf she had been allll over your daughter, you two would have moaned that she was too handsy.\n\nIf her gifts sucked, would she have been ungenerous?\n\nIf she's been too loud, would she have been rude?\n\nIf she didn't have a good job, would she have just been a layabput?", "YTA. \nYour daughter does not have a close relationship with your spouse. She has also never brought a partner to meet you. So during what was likely an already stressful meeting for her, your wife thought she should share her - premature - negative opinion and think your daughter would welcome this?  When she rightly shuts your wife down, you double down on the unwanted advice and think this will go over any better?  Apologize, if she even lets you.", "YTA and so is Mary - not everybody is warm and attentive the first time they meet people. Some people need more time to warm up. Laura is right, you judged her based on a very limited interaction. More importantly, it doesn\u2019t sound like Laura asked either of you for your opinion and was probably taken aback when you both started giving unsolicited advice.", "YTA. As an introvert, it is super uncomfortable for me to meet new people. It takes quite a few meetings and a lot of time spent together to warm up to them. So what may have come off as \"cold\" and \"distant\" to you may have been the anxiety of meeting new people, especially a partner's family, for the first time. You and your wife had no right to make judgments like that after a first meeting to the point of telling your daughter to find somebody better. You owe them both an apology.", "YTA\nI dont see where laura asked you or Mary for an opinion. \nOr why you think everyone needs to be full of sunshine and roses the first time they meet you.", "She was right. Neither of you had any right to shit talk your daughter's GF that you'd met once for the first time. Totally out of line and shitty of you YTA", "YTA. Both you and your wife. First meetings are stressful enough so I don\u2019t see why you felt it appropriate to make such a harsh judgement right away? I mean I get it\u2019s the first impression, but couldn\u2019t you meet her a few times before running with it and deciding you\u2019re right? You have no idea what was going on with the gf that day. You could have at least asked Laura about her a little and said something like \u201cI notice she keeps leaving the table and seems a little distant. Is everything okay? I just want to make sure she\u2019s comfortable\u201d. But instead you chose making a snap judgment about her entire character Based on one short meeting.", "YTA. Maybe the girlfriend is just shy around new people or the parents of her girlfriend? You and your wife truly are quick to judge while it is actually none of your business.", "YTA. I've been at my job for 8 months now and people are just starting to see the real me. Until I'm comfortable, I do a lot more observing and a lot less talking. Doesn't sound like your environment was one to create the warm and fuzzies. I think not being physically affectionate in front of one's parents (especially on a first meeting, doubled for a non traditional relationship) is respectful.", "YTA: both you and Mary. This is everyone's first time meeting and given the nature of the relationships involved, Laura and her GF are understandably keeping their cards close to the vest. This should have been your opportunity to get to know someone new and potentially welcome them into your family. Mary torpedoed it and you went along.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that Mary is not Laura's bio-mom. She only came into Laura's life 6 years ago - that means she's in even less of a position to do what she did.\n\nRegardless of what you thought, you should have kept it to yourselves and waited to see how the relationship played out. Laura is 25 and can figure out for herself when it isn't working, or come to you for advice if she is unsure.

Even if her gf was an introvert, there are plenty of ways you can see if she was loving or warm towards your daughter.

If they weren't present behaviors that you observed in those few hours, then you probably had a good point.", "NAH, this is another one about cultural norms that I think have shifted between the generations.\n\nAs I recall, family members would always dole out advice/opinions and it's just part of the normal back and forth of being a family. That advice is a mix of useful, useless and annoying but you have people looking out for you and in general even when it makes you angry it's a net positive in your life. By that norm, your and your wife's behaviour are fine.\n\nModern norms are that advice is never to be given unless it's actively solicited, and you're most certainly not allowed to have a negative or challenging opinion on anything in anyone's life. It doesn't matter if you meant well, you had an opinion without being asked for one, and that's considered extraordinarily rude nowadays.\n\nI prefer the first version of interaction, but your daughter clearly believes in the second.

This is what caught my eye and led me into defending my wife on her view.", "I agree.\n\nPeople commonly give unsolicited advice, and much of the time, it\u2019s misplaced and is based on ignorance or biased opinions, but I feel like a majority of parents commonly give their children unsolicited opinions. This doesn\u2019t make it right to give an opinion someone else didn\u2019t ask for, but I\u2019ve seen so many parents do this because they think they\u2019re looking out for their child\u2019s best interest, but it only ends up breeding resentment for some kids, especially those who look up to their parents and end up feeling that any negative opinion expressed means that their parents disapprove of them or are rejecting them and invalidating their feelings when a lot of the time, this is far from the case.\n\nUnsolicited advice makes me mad just as much as anyone else depending on the circumstance. I\u2019m in my 30s and my parents still give me advice I didn\u2019t ask for, and I just tell them thanks for looking out for me, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind, but I know what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019ll be fine, and they leave it at that and don\u2019t push it.\n\nIf OP and his wife had continued to push the issue and/or had crossed a line by belittling their daughter or threatening to disown her or some other crazy thing, I would have thought OP was the a-hole, but it\u2019s just hard to see this from a perspective where anyone is an a-hole here because if I felt that way, I\u2019d have to say all parents are assholes and that\u2019s simply not true. It\u2019s genuinely possible for a parent to mean well and to give advice their child didn\u2019t ask for because they do care, but if their child takes it the wrong way, they have to also learn from this and to improve their communication if it\u2019s a possibility that they\u2019re looking at this the wrong way.", "Are you high?

I do agree with you that they were not thinking correctly by jumping to this assumption.

Not to mention, they didn\u2019t pressure her to break up with her girlfriend or give an ultimatum, so it was just an opinion.

Not having met her previous partners, cold might be her standard of care.  I think you and Laura need to speak calmly and sensitively about this event without Mary present.  I think Laura might need your undivided attention to talk this through.  And yeah, if my parents criticized any date the first time I brought one home, it would feel pretty shitty to me too.", "YTA. Do you think that maybe, just maybe, she isn\u2019t openly affectionate with Laura in front of other people because as a queer woman it could be dangerous in some situations and she was being cautious? Or maybe she has past trauma, or maybe she just isn\u2019t the type of person who enjoys PDA. You met her once and already you judge her, instead of giving her time and getting to know her, letting her get to know you. Apologize to your daughter, or you might never be introduced to another partner.", "We have a daughter who has had two ling term relationships with boys we did not like. Do you know what we did?  We held our tongues!   We did not bad mouth them to her and we were always respectful, kind, and accepting when they were around us. Why?  Because we love our daughter and knew that if we said negative things or bad mouthed them, she would see it as an insult to her and shut us out. What we did instead was urge her to focus on school and her goals and let time reveal to her what we already knew. It worked too and she respected the way we handled things.", "YTA. How dare your wife make a judgement of your daughter's gf on the basis of one meeting - and what right did she have to express her opinion as though it mattered? You should have cut that right off. Your daughter is an adult, not a teen under your wife's control, and bringing her gf to meet you was a big step. If she goes NC you'll only have yourself to blame.", "YTA and you need to tell your wife she has no business speaking to your daughter like that. Coming from someone who\u2019s father has been married multiple times for a few years at a time(one for 5 years and one for 8years all met in my late teens and mid twenties)\u2026 if any one of his wives would have said something like that to me I probably never would have come over again and distanced myself from my father. Your daughter has known you her whole life, she\u2019s known Mary for 6 year and probably only minimal interactions in those 6 years. It\u2019s way overstepping her place for Mary to say anything negative about your daughter or her choice in partner. Your daughter brought her gf home to meet YOU. To get YOUR approval and your wife ruined that for her and you followed suit. YTA and you need to tell your daughter how sorry you are for judging her gf on a single first time interaction and that you hope you will get the chance to have more interactions and get to know her more in the future.", "You only see the public face of the relationship. Many people, especially gay couples, minimize public displays of affection because there are people who feel that it is their right and privilege to pass judgment on them, to menace them or otherwise threaten violence to them. Or bring actual violence.\n\nIt\u2019s not your business. You\u2019re in the wrong here.", ">Laura said Mary was in no position to give her an opinion and was being rude. \n\nShe's 100% right. YTA\n\nYou guys are turds. You judged a young lady who was probably just UNCOMFORTABLE around you STRANGERS.", "YTA.\n\n*Laura* decides what she deserves. It's none of either of your business, but especially not Mary, who is essentially an acquaintance of Laura's. \n\nAnd many queer people don't show affection because it makes straight people so uncomfortable to see it. It's also her first time meeting you, she could be naturally reserved, or a million other things. Again, *you don't get to decide that the way she shows affection is inappropriate*.", "YTA. Primarily because you haven't thought at all about how the girlfriend might be feeling.  If you're meeting parents in a same-sex partnership, probably you've got a whole load of extra stuff to worry about beyond the usual meeting-the-parents stuff. You know nothing about her. Is she out to her parents? Has she been able to meet her GF's parents before (were her past partners out to THEIR parents)? Does she have any sense of whether your are OK with your daughter's sexuality? Does you know she's the first woman she's brought home (massive, massive deal)? etc. etc. This situation alone would explain her apparent aloofness - nevermind that you have no idea whether she has had a bad/homophobic meet-the-parents before, or is just shy or reserved; has social anxiety; is non-neuro-typical, etc.. I'm kind of shocked that two adults could decide after one meeting that somebody (a stranger...) isn't warm or attentive, especially given the wider context.   \n\n\nWhat did you want her to do? Jump your daughter at the dinner table? Tell two strangers endearing stories about how she kanoodles with their child on a rainy weekend? Is it her job to prove to you that she's madly in love? Or to be polite and bring gifts (which is a) exactly what is expected at a meet the parents type thing and b) exactly what she did). What did you actually expect? I think that's the real problem... definitely the AH", "YTA\n\nDoesn't sound like your daughter asked for your opinion but you guys gave it anyway.", "You say she was polite, through the whole time, brought lovely presents and than in the same sentence says she didn\u2019t talk to anyone much and wasn\u2019t at all attentive or warm to your daughter! Very interesting, this was your first time meeting in an my opinion not a bad first time meeting. I don\u2019t see what she did wrong for your wife to say she was cold and distant after you said she was polite and through. She is just meeting you, probably trying to get a feel for you are like you are her. She probably doesn\u2019t want to be kissing and hugging on your daughter the first time meeting you out of respect because you know it is her first time in your home and she doesn\u2019t want to come off disrespectful. idk I don\u2019t think this was a good example to say she was cold and distant after you called her polite and through. Your not giving much to back this up, and I\u2019m pretty sure when you and your wife said this to your daughter you didn\u2019t give her a real reason either. If her GF said you all were cold and distant after meeting you do you think this would be a reasonable thing to say? \n\nYTA", "YTA. This is the first significant other your daughter has wanted you to meet. Your reaction after the first encounter should have been, \"I'm very happy for you both. I would love to get to know her better. When can we get together again?\"\n\nPeriod. Full stop. No criticisms. No waffling like \"if you're happy, I'm happy.\" Just loving on your daughter and her girlfriend.", "Imagine if your daughter said \u2018yeah you\u2019re wife\u2019s kind of distant from you she might not be a good choice\u2019", "YTA- Y'all need to apologize. You may be completely accepting of your daughter's sexuality but you don't know what her girlfriend came from, she could have been trying to be respectful and not overly affectionate in front of her gf's parents, especially since this was the first time meeting you! Also not everyone is extroverted, I am an introvert, being introduced to the family of significant others was always a very uncomfortable situation for me. \n\nYou don't base your opinion of someone off of meeting them one time unless they are just completely awful people. This woman was nice, sweet, generous, and considerate yet you and your wife jumped at the opportunity to bash her. Come on, do better, and apologize.", "Mary was rude and YTA for backing Mary for no good reason. You should apologize to your kid before she goes no contact with you.", "Agreed. I feel like Mary is almost a bigger ass and over stepping her step mother boundaries", "I don\u2019t think they really meant well, they were just catering to their own egos", "\"I paid a lot of attention\"  \nClearly not.", "How could you know about Laura\u2019s love life? She never shared her partners with you before now, why pretend you\u2019re more involved than you have been? \n\n\u2026oh", "Some people don\u2019t feel comfortable being affectionate around others especially people they don\u2019t know. Also this is a same sex relationship and it\u2019s not just their comfort they have to consider but those outside the relationship. She was being respectful by not hanging all over Laura. If you felt she was rude talking business during the visit it may have been important but I can see how that comes off rude. Laura finally introduced you to a partner and you attacked her with negativity. You act disappointed which upset your daughter. You should have kept your judgment to yourself. I\u2019m sure if you get to know her better you will see the person Laura loves and cares about.", "Totally agree with this. As someone who has same-sex relationships, I always err on the side of no-PDA, no touchy feely hand holding when meeting parents for the absolute first time, no matter how progressive those parents claim to be. It might come off as cold and distant, but it's primarily a safety concern for both me and my partner.", "YTA.  Laura didn\u2019t ask anyone for their opinion about her girlfriend.  You and your wife are out of line.", "YTA  some couples are not affectionate like that. Y\u2019all are making judgements far too early. She sounds like an introvert. I am not comfortable being affectionate in front of others. Especially if just met them. She\u2019s probably the same. You should not have said what you said.", "YTA. Maybe she was \u201ccold\u201d because she could tell y\u2019all were judging her and was uncomfortable.", "YTA, but only because you\u2019ve made her feel uncomfortable about someone who she clearly feels very strongly about with your assumptions and questions, and this is something you can fix. Apologize, tell her you felt like you were looking out for her at the time but now realize you overstepped while making inferences you shouldn\u2019t have, and ask if you and your wife can have another chance to get to know her girlfriend better, maybe by inviting them to dinner or bowling or a board game night, something that will allow for low key interaction. Hopefully, she\u2019ll forgive and take you up on the offer.\n\nAdditional info: As a queer woman whose wife was previously married to a man, I wasn\u2019t overly affectionate toward her in front of her father and stepmother the first few times we saw each other either because it felt awkward and I didn\u2019t know how to gauge them so I was being respectful. At home I\u2019m super affectionate and now I\u2019m more comfortable in front of others, as is she - for her own reasons, she wasn\u2019t used to being affectionate in front of other people and used to get embarrassed if I called her any sort of pet name within possible hearing distance of her mother, father or son. But she\u2019s affectionate at home, too.", "YTA just because someone is shy, introverted or any thing else doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t find love, wtf", "Yta", "As a guy I feel the same way. Even without it being meeting my partners parents, I'm a bit distant when meeting new people because I'm an overall shy person initially. But I especially would feel uncomfortable being PDA in an intimate setting like meeting new people one on one like this.", "there are also different ways to talk about that if you genuinely were concerned.  Your wife basically told Laura that this woman was cold and not good for her,  and you agreed that she should find somebody better.  Imagine how hurt you'd feel if a loved one said that about your wife when you brought her home to meet them.  YOU could have asked Laura some more about this woman - her personality, what the two shared in common etc - open up a conversation so that your daughter would feel more comfortable talking about the relationship.", "Idk about that, in all my years of dating I've only ever introduced my partner to my parents if i thought \"they were the one\". I'm not about to bring every Tom, Dick & Lucy i date. Too each their own ig lmfao.", "Nah, my parents never knew people I dated that they thought I just never dated. They got shocked to know that I was proposed once and I rejected it. Didnt mean that I'm not close to my parents. I trust them but I dont want to bring someone who will be stranger in the future into my parents' house. As long as I dont have \"the one\", my parents wont meet them"]}
