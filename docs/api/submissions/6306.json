Also, they came into our lives when she was already in college, which meant she didn't get to bond with either of them.\n\nLaura is bisexual, I always have loved her as she is.

That is, until she brought home a girlfriend of hers this year. She was with us from morning till the evening.\n\nLaura's girlfriend (32F) was polite and quiet through the whole time she was with us, brought lovely presents, didn't talk to anyone much, and she wasn't at all attentive or warm towards Laura either. Her phone rang a few times and she went off to answer (she's a prominent businesswoman). \n\nAfter she left, Mary told Laura that she was a little cold and distant overall, and that Laura deserved someone who could give her more of her time and affection.

Meeting your girlfriend's father is a huge deal. You don't know anything about her, and it sounds like you're already passing judgment. I'd be nervous, too.\n\nMary should mind her own business. It's not her place, and her opinion wasn't asked for (neither was yours).", "YTA. You don't know anything about the girlfriend and are already passing judgement? I would wager you were kept away from the other significant others for similar behavioral issues and boundary crossing.\n\nApologize to your daughter and offer to spend more time with the girlfriend to truly get to know her.", "Yta. Youre judging her girlfriend over one interaction. \n\n>she wasn't at all attentive or warm towards Laura either.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that she's purposely not being warm towards her because, as a queer woman, showing affection in front of her partners parents could be potentially dangerous? Queer people never know how someone is going to react to seeing them affectionately interact.", "YTA. You barely know the girlfriend and she might have been distant because of nerves or being in a new environment. Also not everyone shows affection in the same way, or feels comfortable doing so in front of strangers they just met. \n\nThen there the added layer of internalised homophobia. You don't know if her girlfriend has supportive family growing up or the messages she heard and this could absolutely effect how public she is with affections - if you read stories of gay couples being beat up for holding hands you automatically don't do that outside your own home by default.", "YTA. You and your wife are wrong to judge your daughter's partner so harshly after the first meeting. She doesn't seem to have done anything wrong, just not behaving in a way that would immediately appeal to you and your wife.\n\nYou should have trusted your daughter's judgment on this, and given yourselves a chance to get to know her partner properly. You've now done irreparable damage to your relationship with your daughter. Hope it was worth it in order to bad-mouth a person you've only just met.", "YTA you and Mary are both the Asshole. Your daughter is happy and loves her gf and y'all go around judging their interactions when you first meet the girlfriend. She might have been super nervous. Or she is just quiet in general. Maybe she didn't like you. Either way, you and Mary suck. Apologize to your daughter.", "YTA. One evening with the woman is not enough to make that judgment. Many people are not comfortable in new situations and do not show open affection when in the company of strangers. And there is a double stranger situation here as well, since your daughter doesn\u2019t know your wife all that well either. \n\nConsidering that your daughter is dating the woman, both of you ought to be trusting her a bit more on this and should have been a bit more reticent on sticking your noses into her relationship. Bluntly, your wife *was* rude, and so were you for backing her.", "YTA.\n\nLaura's an adult. If it's been nine months, she has a better sense of her relationship than you do. Some people are more reserved in public and affectionate in private and their partners are fine with that. Other times people just aren't demonstrative but show love in other ways. And again, that's fine so long as their partners are fine with it. At any rate, it's not to role of a distant stepmother to be advising her on her relationship after knowing her partner for a day.", "YTA as is your wife - Yes you two mean well.  BUT Laura didn't ask Mary's opinion, she didn't ask yours.  Since Mary's not all that close - if she was that concerned she should have talked to you and had you bring it up in private. \n\nYour daughter cares about this GF enough to bring her home - she's the 1st person you've met.  THAT is a big deal.  \n\nRealize that you just met this woman.  Not every family is warm & welcoming to same sex relationships.  She may have been more reserved about being affectionate with Laura in front of you all because she doesn't know/trust you yet.  She could have had some bad experiences with past GFs families.  Also some people maybe be lovey dovey in private but not into PDA.  \n\nAs for the phone - unfortunately if she's got a high position she's stuck taking calls even during the holidays.\n\nApologize to your daughter for over stepping; if she and GF are happy together that's what's important, and you promise you & Mary will butt out unless she asks for an opinion.", "I know you think you're looking out for your daughter here, but take a step back and recognize what it's like to meet someone's parents, particularly when you're not a straight man. Also, she's under no obligation to be affectionate in her relationships, even without the discomfort of someone's parents being right there. You've pretty effectively invalidated your daughter's relationship with the person who probably is currently her biggest supporter.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Sorry, but speaking as a bisexual woman your daughter\u2019s age, gay (especially bisexual) relationships are still frowned upon in a lot of places and there are plenty of horror stories here on reddit to back that up. Meeting an S/O\u2019s family is a big step and can be extremely stressful even for heterosexual couples. Being bisexual and being the first S/O to meet the parents; holy hell that\u2019s a lot of pressure from the girlfriend\u2019s perspective. \n\nYou have no idea what is going on with this woman or why she was being distant. She could have had a rough holiday, or her job is having complications, a problem with a family member, or simply she could be shy. You met her a whole one time. This woman was sincere enough to  bring you and your wife gifts before even meeting you. She has not done anything wrong other than be quiet and polite. She may not feel comfortable showing public displays of affection around her new girlfriend\u2019s father. Additionally, Some people just aren\u2019t publicly affectionate by nature. \n\nYour wife isn\u2019t Laura\u2019s mother, nor is she bisexual. Considering how late she came into the picture, she should not be having any opinions when it comes to your daughter\u2019s relationship period. Especially if she hasn\u2019t she built a relationship with Laura first. Your wife was absolutely being rude by essentially telling Laura her girlfriend isn\u2019t good enough for her, and that she deserves someone better (by your wife\u2019s standards) while the girlfriend was taking a work call in another room. Are you kidding me? She couldn\u2019t even wait for them to leave before throwing down her judgement, where she had no say to begin with. What if her girlfriend overheard? \n\nYour daughter trusted you by bringing her person around and you effectively did the worst thing possible. You and your wife owe Laura and her girlfriend a genuine apology. Read the whole book before you judge the cover.", "Did she ask either of you for your opinions? If your wife just blurted out that she didn't like her girlfriend, and you agreed with her, then I can see why she's not talking to you.\n\nYour wife, who you admit has no relationship with her, just stated her opinion, without any justification? You can't see how that would hurt your daughter?\n\nYTA (and your wife)", "YTA. Opinions should only be offered when requested, and as you've seen there can be something wrong with freely offering what you think. People can get offended.", "YTA, you met the girlfriend once and only for a few hours.  She could be shy or its hard for her to be comfortable meeting her girlfriends father.  You can't give an opinion or defend an opinion when you have no real mat and bones reason to dislike the girlfriend besides for her not being overly friendly.  \n\nIs she nice to your daughter?  Is your daughter happy?  That is hat matters", "Sorry, buddy, but YTA here.\n\nYou need to take into account what you witnessed can perfectly be the kind of interaction they are actually comfortable with, and it doesn't mean that's the only way the interact with each other. Some couples can be seen as cold in front of others while being very warm and passionate in their privacy.\n\nJust don't make a big deal out of this and apologize to your daughter.", "YTA, Mary offered advice and an opinion that wasn\u2019t asked for. Laura is and adult who appears to be mature enough to make her own decisions and it isn\u2019t about pleasing you or Mary who is also an AH for thinking she has the right to say what she said.", "Yeah, YTA along with your wife.\n\nMary elected to drop unwanted relationship advice and tell your daughter that her 9 month GF wasn't good enough and how they needed to breakup.\n\nI can understand why that pissed your daughter off when she brought her over to meet. And if she's a businesswoman, answering the phone is normal. I wonder if the same observation would have been an issue if she was male?\n\nYou defending your wife seems a snap hip judgement, which I get. But again, you defended Mary prying into and meddling into Laura's personal business.", "YTA. You and your wife judged Laura's girlfriend pretty harshly and that immediately put Laura in a defensive position. Sometimes it can take people time to warm up to others, especially in situations like this where you're meeting your significant other's family for the very first time and feeling nervous. \n\nAlso, just so you're aware, people in same-sex relationships might instinctively be more formal and guarded when in the presence of others and refrain from showing any affection to their partner because, unfortunately, it isn't always safe to do so. I'm not saying that they felt unsafe around you, only that this is something they might have a tendency to do in general.\n\nThe fact that she took the time and effort to pick out \"lovely gifts\" for all of you shows that Laura's girlfriend *does* care to make a good impression on you. You and your wife should both apologize to Laura for being so hard on her girlfriend before you've even gotten a chance to really get to know her.", "Judging from the way you described Laura\u2019s GF being quiet, maybe that\u2019s just how she is? She isn\u2019t into public displays of affection or was nervous meeting you for the first time. \n\nDon\u2019t judge too harshly on the first meeting, give it time. Also, you don\u2019t know how she is behind closed doors, maybe she\u2019s as attentive as you want her to be, just in a private setting where she doesn\u2019t feel like she being judged.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot judge someone's whole personality and their relationship in one stressful meeting.\n\nYour wife doesn't get to decide how much affection is the right amount for your daughter and her partner to be happy with. Neither do you.\n\nFor christs sake can't you remember the pressure of meeting your partners parents for the first time, stick christmas stress on top of that.  Add on the fact that Laura's GF knows it's the first time you've met your daughters GF before.\n\n\nShe brought nice presents, she came even though busy at work. She was polite, and didn't overtake the conversation.\n\n\nWhat more do you want? Seriously? What more did you want?\n\nDo you not get that this reaction of yours is more to do with the fact that this is the first GF of hers you've met?\n\nIf she had been allll over your daughter, you two would have moaned that she was too handsy.\n\nIf her gifts sucked, would she have been ungenerous?\n\nIf she's been too loud, would she have been rude?\n\nIf she didn't have a good job, would she have just been a layabput?", "YTA. \nYour daughter does not have a close relationship with your spouse. She has also never brought a partner to meet you. So during what was likely an already stressful meeting for her, your wife thought she should share her - premature - negative opinion and think your daughter would welcome this?  When she rightly shuts your wife down, you double down on the unwanted advice and think this will go over any better?  Apologize, if she even lets you.", "YTA and so is Mary - not everybody is warm and attentive the first time they meet people. Some people need more time to warm up. Laura is right, you judged her based on a very limited interaction. More importantly, it doesn\u2019t sound like Laura asked either of you for your opinion and was probably taken aback when you both started giving unsolicited advice.", "YTA. As an introvert, it is super uncomfortable for me to meet new people. It takes quite a few meetings and a lot of time spent together to warm up to them. So what may have come off as \"cold\" and \"distant\" to you may have been the anxiety of meeting new people, especially a partner's family, for the first time. You and your wife had no right to make judgments like that after a first meeting to the point of telling your daughter to find somebody better. You owe them both an apology.", "YTA\nI dont see where laura asked you or Mary for an opinion. \nOr why you think everyone needs to be full of sunshine and roses the first time they meet you.", "She was right. Neither of you had any right to shit talk your daughter's GF that you'd met once for the first time. Totally out of line and shitty of you YTA", "YTA. Both you and your wife. First meetings are stressful enough so I don\u2019t see why you felt it appropriate to make such a harsh judgement right away? I mean I get it\u2019s the first impression, but couldn\u2019t you meet her a few times before running with it and deciding you\u2019re right? You have no idea what was going on with the gf that day. You could have at least asked Laura about her a little and said something like \u201cI notice she keeps leaving the table and seems a little distant. Is everything okay? I just want to make sure she\u2019s comfortable\u201d. But instead you chose making a snap judgment about her entire character Based on one short meeting.", "YTA. Maybe the girlfriend is just shy around new people or the parents of her girlfriend? You and your wife truly are quick to judge while it is actually none of your business.", "YTA. I've been at my job for 8 months now and people are just starting to see the real me. Until I'm comfortable, I do a lot more observing and a lot less talking. Doesn't sound like your environment was one to create the warm and fuzzies. I think not being physically affectionate in front of one's parents (especially on a first meeting, doubled for a non traditional relationship) is respectful.", "YTA: both you and Mary. This is everyone's first time meeting and given the nature of the relationships involved, Laura and her GF are understandably keeping their cards close to the vest. This should have been your opportunity to get to know someone new and potentially welcome them into your family. Mary torpedoed it and you went along.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that Mary is not Laura's bio-mom. She only came into Laura's life 6 years ago - that means she's in even less of a position to do what she did.\n\nRegardless of what you thought, you should have kept it to yourselves and waited to see how the relationship played out. Laura is 25 and can figure out for herself when it isn't working, or come to you for advice if she is unsure.

Even if her gf was an introvert, there are plenty of ways you can see if she was loving or warm towards your daughter. It could be a gaze, a tiny smile, or a casual touch - nonverbal behavior that you could see. If they weren't present behaviors that you observed in those few hours, then you probably had a good point.", "NAH, this is another one about cultural norms that I think have shifted between the generations.\n\nAs I recall, family members would always dole out advice/opinions and it's just part of the normal back and forth of being a family. That advice is a mix of useful, useless and annoying but you have people looking out for you and in general even when it makes you angry it's a net positive in your life. By that norm, your and your wife's behaviour are fine.\n\nModern norms are that advice is never to be given unless it's actively solicited, and you're most certainly not allowed to have a negative or challenging opinion on anything in anyone's life. It doesn't matter if you meant well, you had an opinion without being asked for one, and that's considered extraordinarily rude nowadays.\n\nI prefer the first version of interaction, but your daughter clearly believes in the second. Up to you whether you apologise but I believe modern norms are to not say anything negative even if you care about someone.", "NAH\n\nLaura has the right to date the person she wants to date, so long as the other person wants to date her as well.

I (f) would never be openly affectionate, perhaps aside from a knowing glance or maybe knock knees under the table, with a boyfriend in my parents\u2019 house or anywhere I was a guest. Personally I find it rude to behave in an intimate/affectionate way in front of other people. Perhaps the daughter and her girlfriend think similarly.", "My mom commented just before my wedding (to my now wife) that she had never seen us kiss before. Or be affectionate in front of her.\n\nWell, yeah ma, you used to say how gross lesbians were when I was growing up! And how me being gay was your greatest fear. No wonder I don\u2019t want to act gay around you. \n\nThings are better now (my youngest brother came out and my mom went from pretend-you\u2019re-not-gay to a PFLAG mom basically overnight) but that trauma runs deep, man.", "This! I live in a very old school republican town. While my parents aren't Homophobic, I never know how everyone else will react. I didn't even hold hands with my partner if we left the safety of my parents' house.", "exactly this plus the fact she is a prominent business woman also makes it even more that she was behaving that way in order to keep some respect etc.", "I was looking for a comment like this- she\u2019s probably trying to feel them out and what they would be comfortable with. I\u2019m sure there was an experience at some point where she displayed affection for another woman and was treated poorly for it", "I'm seriously betting that if that was a dude answering business calls, they probably wouldn't have cared.", "> *\"Your daughter trusted you by bringing her person around and you effectively did the worst thing possible.\"*\n\nYou are so right. And apparently, it took Laura quite a while to build that trust, seeing as how this is the first person she's *ever* brought home to introduce to her family. By being so harsh and dismissive of someone Laura obviously thinks the world of, OP and his wife have effectively sent everything back to square one and showed Laura that, as it turns out, they really aren't deserving of that trust. How careless of them.", "This.", "I'm not saying there was something wrong with her. Laura is all about romance, big gestures and openness. Her girlfriend barely acknowledged her at all. This is what caught my eye and led me into defending my wife on her view.", "I agree.\n\nPeople commonly give unsolicited advice, and much of the time, it\u2019s misplaced and is based on ignorance or biased opinions, but I feel like a majority of parents commonly give their children unsolicited opinions. This doesn\u2019t make it right to give an opinion someone else didn\u2019t ask for, but I\u2019ve seen so many parents do this because they think they\u2019re looking out for their child\u2019s best interest, but it only ends up breeding resentment for some kids, especially those who look up to their parents and end up feeling that any negative opinion expressed means that their parents disapprove of them or are rejecting them and invalidating their feelings when a lot of the time, this is far from the case.\n\nUnsolicited advice makes me mad just as much as anyone else depending on the circumstance. I\u2019m in my 30s and my parents still give me advice I didn\u2019t ask for, and I just tell them thanks for looking out for me, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind, but I know what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019ll be fine, and they leave it at that and don\u2019t push it.\n\nIf OP and his wife had continued to push the issue and/or had crossed a line by belittling their daughter or threatening to disown her or some other crazy thing, I would have thought OP was the a-hole, but it\u2019s just hard to see this from a perspective where anyone is an a-hole here because if I felt that way, I\u2019d have to say all parents are assholes and that\u2019s simply not true. It\u2019s genuinely possible for a parent to mean well and to give advice their child didn\u2019t ask for because they do care, but if their child takes it the wrong way, they have to also learn from this and to improve their communication if it\u2019s a possibility that they\u2019re looking at this the wrong way.", "Are you high? They judged someone over a short period of observation for the first time. They have no clue how the gf typically acts. Maybe she was nervous since it was a first meeting?", "Except the wife isn\u2019t really a mother figure to his daughter. They got married when she was in college. It\u2019s just her dads wife to her so her opinion is honestly not needed AT ALL. And not everyone is open with PDA. They need to give the daughter space to have her own relationships in ways she feels fulfilled.", "Absolutely not. A few hours is absolutely not enough time to judge a relationship or the people within it. As a very introverted person, I can tell you that your conclusion is dead wrong. If I'm out into a stressful situation with people I don't know, I will absolutely freeze up. \n\nIt takes many meetings before I start to loosen up.", "You can tell this has happened in the past too.

After 15 years of a delightfully wonderful marriage I'm still not particularly affectionate in any public setting. After all this time we do tease each other affectionately a bit in front of our respective families but not too much and I'm incredibly confident they've seen us hug maybe half a dozen times tops. Not seeming affectionate during a first meeting with the patents? Like duh, nerves, trying to make a good impression, quiet so you don't say anything too dumb. OP is an idiot", "Meeting my boyfriend's parents for the first time, I was definitely not all over him. I'm not a huge PDA person anyway, but the first time meeting the parents is NOT the time to be all lovey and touchy. If they assumed I was \"cold\" that first time, they at least kept their mouths shut and got to know me better before deciding whether or not I was \"good enough\" for their son. OP deciding to pass judgement his first time meeting his daughters gf is a solid way to guarantee he doesn't meet her future partners.", "My small city is a pretty good split of conservative and liberal so I literally never know how someone's going to react.

It shows how unimportant she is to you (despite the fact that she is *clearly* extremely important to your daughter) and how unwilling you are to even get to know her.  You've dismissed her entirely and that is so unfair, not only to her, but to Laura.", "You don't know the GF you have met her once. Until you actually know here, maybe you should reserve judgement. Re,emebr when you were in her shoes? Put yourself back in the, and think again.\n\nCause there's no way your daughter isn't thinking what I wrote. That no matter what you and your wife would have found something wrong.\n\n\nYou basically told your daughter her relationship was bad because your wife thought it was. Without actually taking time to know the relationship.\n\nNo wonder this is the first GF of hers you've met.", "YTA, you met her briefly. Keep your opinions to yourself or your daughter won't be back.", "People don't do romance-y crap in front of their parents. That's weird. Did you expect to see them make out?", "That\u2019s actually pretty rude for you to belittle someone for expressing a different opinion, but I\u2019ll bite.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong at all- far from it actually because I feel you are right- and I totally respect your opinion. I do agree with you that they were not thinking correctly by jumping to this assumption. It was the way that they presented their opinions in a respectful way without being pushy (which is why dad\u2019s confused as to what he did wrong) that swayed me to my decision. \n\nAs I stated to another commenter, I made the mistake of putting n t a out of habit but I really feel no one is the asshole here, not even her [I had to correct my vote to put n a h because that\u2019s truly my own opinion] because she isn\u2019t wrong for expressing how she felt or being upset, but it\u2019s common for parents to give unsolicited opinions when they\u2019re trying to look out for your best interests. Does that make them right? No, it doesn\u2019t, but no one is perfect and parents make mistakes too.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make them assholes, and it doesn\u2019t make her one either. Her parents are clearly misguided and were too quick to jump to conclusions based on a single interaction, but I would be lying if I said I haven\u2019t seen many parents do this because they mean well and think they\u2019re just looking out for their kids when they\u2019re causing more harm than good. Not to mention, they didn\u2019t pressure her to break up with her girlfriend or give an ultimatum, so it was just an opinion. It wasn\u2019t like they told her if she didn\u2019t leave her girlfriend, they\u2019d disown her. \n\nNo one is an asshole in this situation, and my own personal opinion is that calling them assholes is overreacting and exaggerated.", "I agree with you that their opinion wasn\u2019t needed, so I\u2019m definitely not disagreeing with this.\n\nThe reason why I voted the way I did is because OP and his wife weren\u2019t really disrespectful to her about expressing their opinions. I do think their opinions were misplaced, but I don\u2019t think he is a bad parent because of it. His wife\u2019s opinion may be misguided, but it sounded like she meant well. I would have voted y t a had they belittled her for her feelings or had gotten onto her for them, but since she got upset and walked out, it\u2019s hard to say for sure how she may have felt because I\u2019m sure it felt hurtful for her dad to side with his wife instead of her.\n\nThey don\u2019t sound like bad people to me- just misguided and not as if they formed biased opinions based on them not wanting her to date a woman or anything of that nature, but it\u2019s just hard for me to say anyone is an AH here because I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole, but they aren\u2019t either.\n\nAnd what I really mean to vote as was n a h but because it\u2019s such a habit, I put n t a, so I\u2019m correcting my mistake lol", "Hahaha you know I didn\u2019t mean it *that* way but certain acts of affection can be viewed as intimate acts like stroking someone\u2019s leg or rubbing their back.

I don't want to do or say the wrong thing before they get to know me since I might have to deal with them for a very long time.  The safer thing to do is be polite and quiet until you get the lay of the land.  Also, it's just generally considered rude to take phone calls in front of other people when visiting.  I have always politely excused myself from the room when taking work phone calls when visiting, even when it is people I know well.", "YTA. It\u2019s absolutely unfair to judge someone over ONE interaction. Also a lot of queer folks aren\u2019t comfortable displaying affection as it can be a motive for agression. You and your wife lacked empathy.", "YTA and so is your wife. It was the first meeting and the gf was probably nervous. Why on Earth your wife offered an unsolicited opinion especially when she's not that close to your daughter is beyond me, and you taking your wife's side only made it worse.", "YTA you didn't *defend your wife from your daughter* . You and your wife attacked your daughter's choice in partner after only meeting them once.", "YTA \u2014 so you passed judgement on someone after knowing them for a few hours?

She's a busy executive taking phone calls during the visit,  so she isn't shy and should be able to put her skills to use and be engaging.  I ate an ice cream cone with my dil and knew she was the one for my son. They have been happily married 20 years. Parents know their children, at least parents that are close like this father and daughter.  I can't get over the feeling that these parents were set up for a fight. I guarantee that as soon as the SO leaves the room, the daughter says,'Well, what do you think? Isn't she wonderful?'", "Yeah, many people appear cold and distant in stressful situations. OP is basically judging the girlfriend for being nervous about meeting her partner's parents.", "OP, I have kids I ADORE, but I've already told myself that when they bring home partners in the future, I'm not going to say a single negative thing unless the relationship seems abusive. If they ask my opinion, I'll give a gentle one. The truth is that I've seen that if you crap all over their partners, kids usually keep dating them, they just don't come to their parents when there's a real issue.\n\nImagine your daughter and this woman move into together and your daughter gets abused. Do you think she's going to call you, OP? Probably not. Do you think she'll come to you with more serious relationship issues? Probably not.

That wasn't well-thought-out.", "I paid a lot of attention through the whole time that she wad with us because I'd never met a significant other of my daughter before. She was quite confident and acted like it the whole time. Laura was head over heels but her girlfriend surely looked very different. She took business calls half the time anyway", "Yeah same. My s/o has kids from previous relationships and I don\u2019t want to make his kids feel weird about seeing me being too overly affectionate with their dad. It can be a respectful thing I think.", "Yeah...this.

I respect your opinion, and I agree with you that they\u2019re wrong, and you\u2019re totally entitled to your feelings on this.\n\nI\u2019m just having a hard time negatively assessing anyone in the situation because I\u2019ve seen many parents who offer unsolicited advice and they usually aren\u2019t right and it doesn\u2019t make them right, but for some reason, a lot of parents tend to give advice their kids don\u2019t need because they think they\u2019re looking out what\u2019s best for them, but I even though I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a-holes for being concerned, I do feel like parents do need to take a chill pill with stuff like this and to let their kids make their own decisions and to think for themselves because they did their job to raise them to adulthood and it\u2019s not their job to parent them any longer."]}
