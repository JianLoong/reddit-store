I had around $9,000 saved up and I\u2019m saving up to get my own apartment when I\u2019m older. Yesterday my mom told me she had to take out $5000 to help a friend and I asked when she was gonna pay me back she seemed confused that I would expect her to do that. She went on a rant about how she bought groceries that I ate I live in a house that she payed rent for and a bunch of other things and she had no intentions to make me pay it back so I was extremely selfish to expect her to. She claimed that the 5k she took from me isn\u2019t even close to how much she spent on me as a baby and I have absolutely no right to want her to pay it back.\n\nThe way I see it is that she basically stole over 2 years worth of my life since I was constantly working or at school and I put myself through absolute hell to earn it. If it were $10 $20 $50 or even $100 I\u2019d be fine letting her keep it since it\u2019s not that much. $5000 however is a significant amount of money and represents a chunk of my life I essentially worked for nothing.

Honestly, I would withdraw the rest of my money in cash, hide it very well or leave it with a trusted friend, and just use the bank account to cash your paychecks. \n\nI also grew up with toxic parents who threw the fact that they paid to raise me in my face. THEY ARE WRONG. That is their responsibility, to feed and house you until the age of 18. Do not back down, do not allow access to your money, and let her know you expect that money back or you will find a lawyer to take her to civil claims court.", "She's legally obligated to provide food clothing and shelter.  You are NTA for demanding that money back.", "NTA - but I doubt you will get the money back. Absolutely crazy for her to take money from your account without asking, and even more crazy for her to not pay you back. You should find a way to store your money so that she cannot access it", "NTA. She chose to create you and that comes with expenses that SHE is responsible for. She stole from you. It\u2019s out of control she\u2019s refusing to pay you back and acting entitled like that. She\u2019s your mother, she\u2019s legally required to give you the things she\u2019s accusing you of being selfish about.", "NTA. She should pay you back. What is wrong with parents who expect their children to pay them back for upbringing costs???", "NTA OP\n\nSome parents just see their kids as assets. Wonder why do they become parents. Feeding your own child, putting roof above their head, clothes to wear and providing education is the barest minimum that any parent has to do. If they don't have the means to provide such, they mustn't become one. As they say, every child deserves a parent but not every parent deserves a child.", "Your parents are legally and morally responsible for providing you with life and the necessities of life until you are an adult. You do not owe her for your existence. She stole the money. You will probably not see it back unless you can convince a sane family member to help you. Go to the bank and tell them what happened and ask them how you can save money without being at risk from your parent.  Your mother\u2019s words are a common manipulation that has been documented over and over again, and a sign of a toxic relationship. This has happened in my family too.", "NTA. Call the non emergency line or visit your local police department to file a report. Depending what you can prove, they may be able to file charges. The threat of it may be enough to make her return the money however you may get kicked out. \n\nAnd she is legally obligated to provide you shelter, food, water, and basic care while you are a minor", "NTA You didn't agree, so just taking your money is stealing. Paying for your own upbringing is not a thing, that is something your mom agreed to when she decided to raise you.", "NTA. Your mom sucks for doing that. She had a child, she had the obligation to care for you, you can\u2019t be expected to pay for her decision to have you. You did the work, its your money. You should see about getting a bank account she can\u2019t access so she doesn\u2019t take the rest of your money.", "NTA by a long stretch!\n\nAs a parent, she is responsible for taking care of you, so the argument that she fed and housed you does not hold any weight in my opinion. In addition, she didn't even take the money because she needed it badly. No, a friend needed it! She has no right to take your money at all, but even more so to then give it to a friend! \n\nAlso I'd argue that you probably need the money more then her friend, so is she going to take $5000 from her friend, when you'll be in need of the money? I would take a hard guess and say no, she wouldn't. She should absolutely pay you back, she stole that money!", "NTA, you're mother stole that money from her and unless you do something about it she will take the rest. Unfortunately you may need to file a police report or tell her that is your intention unless she pays you back.", "NTA. You should not have let her take it. Get a new bank account at the soonest opportunity.", "NTA. Raising you is simply a duty for every parent, not something they can expect thankfulness for, or even a kind of pay back! \n\nYes, indeed she did steal from you, as she took your money without your consent. She even didn't think of asking your help first. \n\nI would demand her to give her my money back immediately or inform the rest of the family and/or her friends what she has done to you. This is a form of financial child abuse (google it). Talk to a trusted person in school. Try to get access to free legal advice.\n\nAnyway, if she says her friend can't give it back, that's not your problem, but hers. Insist of having your money back now. Don't agree with getting it back later, as you will never see your money back.", "Why do so many people on Reddit have bank accounts their parents can access?", "As so many have said: NTA.. \nmy parents were wonderful loving parents and would add 50% to whatever I managed to save at the end of a year from doing odd jobs.. if at the end of a year I saved 100.00 without spending it on foolish stuff like I usually did, they would add 50.00 to my account. It gave me some incentive to save.\nI\u2019m sorry your mom has done this. I hope you can get it back somehow.", "I'd be asking mom what that $5K was for to help her friend and why the friend couldn't get a loan or ask someone else for that money.

So for her to expect payment for that is beyond me. I think she should repay you. Find out if there is some way for her not to have access to the rest of your money.

Leave ASAP. NTA.", "Oh my. NTA OP. It is your mothers RESPONSIBILITY to provide all of those things for you until you turn 18. It\u2019s horrifying for her to think you owe her something for that. \n\nYou are incredibly responsible to have saved such a large sum of money in such a short time working to prepare yourself for the real world. Your mother is incredibly irresponsible to think you are indebted to her for fulfilling the commitment she made to being a mother. You\u2019re only 17, she is not entitled to rent from you, or any other monetary contributions to the household. \n\nWhat she did will set you back for a very long time. $5,000 is over half of your savings, and a huge chunk of money! I honestly can\u2019t believe you were comfortable giving her the money in the first place, but that\u2019s assuming she didn\u2019t just take it out of a joint account herself. If she did, you can go speak with your bank to see if you have any recourse. It could be considered stealing if you can prove that the money in the account was earned by you (direct deposit/pay stubs) and you may have a legal avenue of getting it back. Good luck, and please update!", "Info: is your mom going to get that money back from the friend? If so then does she just plan on keeping the money for herself? \n\nNTA the things that your mother is listing are the things she's required to do. You're not wrong to ask for your money back.", "NTA and she should pay you back. As somebody else pointed out, you are her responsibility until you are 18 and she is totally in the wrong for even bringing up how much she has spent doing something that it was her decision and then responsibility to do.\n\nFrom the way you wrote it, your mother has taken $5000 from your account without consulting you and given it to \"a friend\"... do you know who this friend is and whether or not they will be giving the money back to your mother ? If so, then your mother has no argument about paying you back does she ? When the friend pays it back, the money is yours.\n\nI don't live in the US, I live in the UK but here some banks allow you to have your own bank account from 16. It would be worth checking if you can do that so that your mother would no longer have access to your account and cannot take any more money from you without your giving it to her.", "NTA.\n\n>She went on a rant about how **she bought groceries that I ate I live in a house that she payed rent for** and a bunch of other things and **she had no intentions to make me pay it back** so I was extremely selfish to expect her to.

If she doesn't want to spend on kid maybe she shouldn\u2019t have had you in the first place instead of telling you that you somehow owe her because of it. That's insane, she stole from you.\n\nIdk if you can but maybe you should go to the police, just to let her understand that you're dead serious when you say you want your money back.\n\nAnd OPEN YOUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT.
