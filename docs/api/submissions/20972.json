Yesterday my mom told me she had to take out $5000 to help a friend and I asked when she was gonna pay me back she seemed confused that I would expect her to do that. She went on a rant about how she bought groceries that I ate I live in a house that she payed rent for and a bunch of other things and she had no intentions to make me pay it back so I was extremely selfish to expect her to. She claimed that the 5k she took from me isn\u2019t even close to how much she spent on me as a baby and I have absolutely no right to want her to pay it back.\n\nThe way I see it is that she basically stole over 2 years worth of my life since I was constantly working or at school and I put myself through absolute hell to earn it. If it were $10 $20 $50 or even $100 I\u2019d be fine letting her keep it since it\u2019s not that much. $5000 however is a significant amount of money and represents a chunk of my life I essentially worked for nothing.

THEY ARE WRONG. That is their responsibility, to feed and house you until the age of 18. Do not back down, do not allow access to your money, and let her know you expect that money back or you will find a lawyer to take her to civil claims court.", "She's legally obligated to provide food clothing and shelter.  You are NTA for demanding that money back.", "NTA - but I doubt you will get the money back. Absolutely crazy for her to take money from your account without asking, and even more crazy for her to not pay you back. You should find a way to store your money so that she cannot access it", "NTA. She chose to create you and that comes with expenses that SHE is responsible for. She stole from you. It\u2019s out of control she\u2019s refusing to pay you back and acting entitled like that. She\u2019s your mother, she\u2019s legally required to give you the things she\u2019s accusing you of being selfish about.", "NTA. She should pay you back. What is wrong with parents who expect their children to pay them back for upbringing costs???", "NTA OP\n\nSome parents just see their kids as assets. Wonder why do they become parents. Feeding your own child, putting roof above their head, clothes to wear and providing education is the barest minimum that any parent has to do. If they don't have the means to provide such, they mustn't become one. As they say, every child deserves a parent but not every parent deserves a child.", "Your parents are legally and morally responsible for providing you with life and the necessities of life until you are an adult. You do not owe her for your existence. She stole the money. You will probably not see it back unless you can convince a sane family member to help you. Go to the bank and tell them what happened and ask them how you can save money without being at risk from your parent.  Your mother\u2019s words are a common manipulation that has been documented over and over again, and a sign of a toxic relationship. This has happened in my family too.", "NTA. Call the non emergency line or visit your local police department to file a report. Depending what you can prove, they may be able to file charges.

Paying for your own upbringing is not a thing, that is something your mom agreed to when she decided to raise you.", "NTA. Your mom sucks for doing that. She had a child, she had the obligation to care for you, you can\u2019t be expected to pay for her decision to have you. You did the work, its your money.

In addition, she didn't even take the money because she needed it badly. No, a friend needed it! She has no right to take your money at all, but even more so to then give it to a friend! \n\nAlso I'd argue that you probably need the money more then her friend, so is she going to take $5000 from her friend, when you'll be in need of the money? I would take a hard guess and say no, she wouldn't. She should absolutely pay you back, she stole that money!", "NTA, you're mother stole that money from her and unless you do something about it she will take the rest.

Get a new bank account at the soonest opportunity.", "NTA. Raising you is simply a duty for every parent, not something they can expect thankfulness for, or even a kind of pay back! \n\nYes, indeed she did steal from you, as she took your money without your consent. She even didn't think of asking your help first. \n\nI would demand her to give her my money back immediately or inform the rest of the family and/or her friends what she has done to you. This is a form of financial child abuse (google it). Talk to a trusted person in school. Try to get access to free legal advice.\n\nAnyway, if she says her friend can't give it back, that's not your problem, but hers. Insist of having your money back now.

Your mother is incredibly irresponsible to think you are indebted to her for fulfilling the commitment she made to being a mother. You\u2019re only 17, she is not entitled to rent from you, or any other monetary contributions to the household. \n\nWhat she did will set you back for a very long time. $5,000 is over half of your savings, and a huge chunk of money! I honestly can\u2019t believe you were comfortable giving her the money in the first place, but that\u2019s assuming she didn\u2019t just take it out of a joint account herself.

If so, then your mother has no argument about paying you back does she ? When the friend pays it back, the money is yours.\n\nI don't live in the US, I live in the UK but here some banks allow you to have your own bank account from 16.

Not that what you wanted to use it for would change the fact that what she did was messed up, its your money either way to be clear, it just adds extra sting to the issue. \n\nHer claim that because she provided food and shelter that she's entitled to your money is wildly inaccurate and just wrong. She was legally obliged to provide those things because she *chose* to bring you into the world and then had to deal with the financial consequences of that.
