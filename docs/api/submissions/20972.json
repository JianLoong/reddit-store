Yesterday my mom told me she had to take out $5000 to help a friend and I asked when she was gonna pay me back she seemed confused that I would expect her to do that. She went on a rant about how she bought groceries that I ate I live in a house that she payed rent for and a bunch of other things and she had no intentions to make me pay it back so I was extremely selfish to expect her to. She claimed that the 5k she took from me isn\u2019t even close to how much she spent on me as a baby and I have absolutely no right to want her to pay it back.\n\nThe way I see it is that she basically stole over 2 years worth of my life since I was constantly working or at school and I put myself through absolute hell to earn it. If it were $10 $20 $50 or even $100 I\u2019d be fine letting her keep it since it\u2019s not that much. $5000 however is a significant amount of money and represents a chunk of my life I essentially worked for nothing.

THEY ARE WRONG. That is their responsibility, to feed and house you until the age of 18. Do not back down, do not allow access to your money, and let her know you expect that money back or you will find a lawyer to take her to civil claims court.", "She's legally obligated to provide food clothing and shelter.  You are NTA for demanding that money back.", "NTA - but I doubt you will get the money back. Absolutely crazy for her to take money from your account without asking, and even more crazy for her to not pay you back. You should find a way to store your money so that she cannot access it", "NTA. She chose to create you and that comes with expenses that SHE is responsible for. She stole from you. It\u2019s out of control she\u2019s refusing to pay you back and acting entitled like that. She\u2019s your mother, she\u2019s legally required to give you the things she\u2019s accusing you of being selfish about.", "NTA. She should pay you back. What is wrong with parents who expect their children to pay them back for upbringing costs???", "NTA OP\n\nSome parents just see their kids as assets. Wonder why do they become parents. Feeding your own child, putting roof above their head, clothes to wear and providing education is the barest minimum that any parent has to do. If they don't have the means to provide such, they mustn't become one. As they say, every child deserves a parent but not every parent deserves a child.", "Your parents are legally and morally responsible for providing you with life and the necessities of life until you are an adult. You do not owe her for your existence. She stole the money. You will probably not see it back unless you can convince a sane family member to help you. Go to the bank and tell them what happened and ask them how you can save money without being at risk from your parent.  Your mother\u2019s words are a common manipulation that has been documented over and over again, and a sign of a toxic relationship. This has happened in my family too.", "NTA. Call the non emergency line or visit your local police department to file a report. Depending what you can prove, they may be able to file charges.

Paying for your own upbringing is not a thing, that is something your mom agreed to when she decided to raise you.", "NTA. Your mom sucks for doing that. She had a child, she had the obligation to care for you, you can\u2019t be expected to pay for her decision to have you. You did the work, its your money.

In addition, she didn't even take the money because she needed it badly. No, a friend needed it! She has no right to take your money at all, but even more so to then give it to a friend! \n\nAlso I'd argue that you probably need the money more then her friend, so is she going to take $5000 from her friend, when you'll be in need of the money? I would take a hard guess and say no, she wouldn't. She should absolutely pay you back, she stole that money!", "NTA, you're mother stole that money from her and unless you do something about it she will take the rest.

Get a new bank account at the soonest opportunity.", "NTA. Raising you is simply a duty for every parent, not something they can expect thankfulness for, or even a kind of pay back! \n\nYes, indeed she did steal from you, as she took your money without your consent. She even didn't think of asking your help first. \n\nI would demand her to give her my money back immediately or inform the rest of the family and/or her friends what she has done to you. This is a form of financial child abuse (google it). Talk to a trusted person in school. Try to get access to free legal advice.\n\nAnyway, if she says her friend can't give it back, that's not your problem, but hers. Insist of having your money back now.

Your mother is incredibly irresponsible to think you are indebted to her for fulfilling the commitment she made to being a mother. You\u2019re only 17, she is not entitled to rent from you, or any other monetary contributions to the household. \n\nWhat she did will set you back for a very long time. $5,000 is over half of your savings, and a huge chunk of money! I honestly can\u2019t believe you were comfortable giving her the money in the first place, but that\u2019s assuming she didn\u2019t just take it out of a joint account herself.

If so, then your mother has no argument about paying you back does she ? When the friend pays it back, the money is yours.\n\nI don't live in the US, I live in the UK but here some banks allow you to have your own bank account from 16.

Set an example for her by being happy the second you can leave.", "Well, OP didn\u2019t state what kind of \u201cother stuff\u201d, but I was just letting you know cps can\u2019t do anything over a he said she said parent holding onto their kid\u2019s money.", "I can\u2019t leave her though, she\u2019ll probably grow up similarly to how I did when I lived with my father and that led to several mentaillnesses", "Financial abuse is abuse, it won't get the money back but it might help them get out of the situation or help their sister.\n\nI said use small claims courts afterwards to try to get the money back.", "But you also have to ask yourself if you have the power to prevent that by staying. If you leave and create a life for yourself, there's the possibility that you will be able to provide help when it is your sister's turn to do the same. If you stay and you both remain powerless and abused,  nothing will change.", "Omg okay. I work for cps and was just letting you know it wouldn\u2019t get investigated.", "Someone mentioned letting the friend know where the money came from.  I agree with this decision.  Maybe the \"friend\" will pay it back.", "NTA.  She is basically stealing your hard earned money.  Yeah she's your mother, but all the money she spent on you as a baby?  Are you effing kidding me? I am so angry for you I don't even know what to tell you.  Your mom is being a total, complete AH.  One of the worst AH's I've seen on reddit.  I'm so sorry she did this to you.  Keep saving your money & don't let her know how much you have saved & def don't EVER give her money again.  Hopefully you can save up enough money to get away from the thief you live with.", "Your mother is a thief you are her responsibility since she chose to keep you as her child that\u2019s called parenting.  Her friend is not your responsibility or your moms.  Ntah I would call cps on her", "NTA. You ARE allowed to have a bank account. I had one when I was 15. (In Canada). Your mother has no right to your money. She committed a crime. I\u2019d demand my money back or go full social media frenzy and shame her and her friend for stealing off of a child. FB, IG, SMS every friend and relative you have. Maybe even get LE involved. This is an outrage.", "NTA a parent who suddenly starts charging children for living?\n\nimportant legal question was the account in her name or was it a uniform gift to minor's account? I do this professionally. if it was a UTMA or UGTM account the money is legally yours and by abusing that the guardian is legally responsible for keeping it separate from her own funds.\n\nin short, go to the police. this is felony grand theft.", "God what kind of person would do that to their child without at least a discussion? You don\u2019t owe money for being raised, that\u2019s a laugh. Start keeping your money where she can no longer touch it. You have every right to demand repayment, it\u2019s just unlikely you will get it. NTA.", "NTA. Your mother was legal responsible for providing you a roof over your head, food and clothing. \n\nUnfortunately, because she has your money - it's probably gone already.  Do you have any family members you could get help from?", "NTA - Food, shelter, clothing.. etc..  as a parent, this is what is expect of you to provide for your child.     Kudos for your discipline over the years, it will serve you well as you get older.\n\nNot sure you're ever going to get anything back from mom, but consider her paid in full.  Think about your future and investing in that as well. (Education, training so you can life a self-sufficient life)\n\n  Moms TA here.", "Press charged against that thief", "File a police report. Not sure what country you're in, but most first world countries have legal protections for income made by children, so that parents can't get rich exploiting their kids. You've worked your ass off for this, and she stole what should be your future. Can you get the rest of your cash out of the safe somehow first? Expect to be kicked out, so have a plan for that. Secure all your legal documents--birth certificate etc--and store them off the property, as well as anything else you can't afford to lose. NTA.", "Big time NTA. Also you should have invested your money", "This is the answer!  NTA", "That\u2019s a good idea however as her \u201cGuardian\u201d mother might still be able to cash those. I know people that gave savings bonds to grandkids and parents cash them because they are the guardians and were able to do so without the grandparents permission.", "As far as bank accounts go, minors can only have one with parents. At least in the u.s., not sure about other countries.  Op said their money is kept in a safe controlled by mom.", "Because in the US a minor cannot have a bank account alone. Part of it is having a bank account you have to sign a contract and minors are not considered able to sign a contract. But if she can take her cash and maybe put it in Visa cards and try and hide those maybe have a PIN number but if she doesn\u2019t give her mother the money they will probably be hell to pay. So the best thing right now is to try and get the money out of the safe for one if she can and keep it somewhere that her mom won\u2019t have access.\n\nEither that or spend it all. But if you can keep it so you can move out and don\u2019t let her know you\u2019re gonna move out once you turn 18 you can leave whether you\u2019re in school or not she can also open Up her own account and put a lock on the account that she\u2019s the only one able to access it. You can put a password on your account.", "Is there an adult outside of the house that you completely trust?  You can have them cosign to open an account for you.  Hell, I'd do it for you.  You have got to take access to that money away from your thieving mother.", "Try and get it out of the safe borrowing that amount of money for a friend that\u2019s abuse she is Stealing your money pure and simple. I definitely would try to get the rest out and not put any more in if you can. If she gave it to the friend and the friend needs to pay you back and let her know that you\u2019re going to ask the friend for your money back if she won\u2019t give it back to you. So you might tell your mother that if she doesn\u2019t pay you back either her or her friend that you will take it to small claims court.\n\nYou might want to see if the police will take a report on it. She cannot charge you for anything as a minor especially for food shelter etc.  You need to get out of there as soon as possible is there a relative that you can go to or a friend that might take you in? It\u2019s financial abuse no doubt about it.", "Hire a safe cracker. She has proven unfit as a guardian of your funds.", "Hey, just so you know, while most banks will make you have a parent on the account as a minor, this isn't true of credit unions. You can usually get accounts that are solely yours while under 18. \n\nI highly recommend you set up an account with a credit union and put all our money there from now on. Not sure if you can get stuff out of the safe but anything in the future at least should be alright. \n\nIf you're not allowed to have an account, do this right after work or school or \"while at a friend's house\" and give them a PO box or a friend's address to send mail to. (Even with e-statements enabled you'll get some amount of mail.)", "Sorry to say this but you\u2019re never getting any of your money back that she has in her safe.\n\nGet a bank account and don\u2019t tell her, ask a trusted adult to be in the account if you need an adult on it.", "As soon as you turn 18, you should be able to open a bank account without your mother's permission. That's probably the safest place to have your money to keep her from stealing more of it. Until then, if you can move your remaining savings to a trusted friend or relative's house, I'd do that. (And seconding the recommendation to get control of your passport/ID/birth certificate/other documents if you can; if you can't, at least try to take pictures of them or make copies.)", "There probably isn't a friend.", "Yes unfortunately you don\u2019t have a lot of leverage here, but I would still try and file a police report. Hope that they follow up at least with your mother as to what\u2019s going on this Might scare her enough to think twice before doing it again. However once you\u2019re 18 you can file a claim against her for your money. You can do it in small claims court you don\u2019t need an attorney just a little research on what you have to do.\n\nWhy are you giving it to her to put in her safe? do you have a trusted relative or friend whose parent can open an account with you wow that might be a little too trusting. Can you take your money and put it elsewhere keeping it in the house won\u2019t work she\u2019ll find it. I wonder if you can open up a safe deposit box at the bank.\n\nAre you working is that where this money came from? Do not let her do this to you you have to start Standing up for yourself and not allow her to steal from you. Maybe instead of giving her the cash you can go and buy visa cards with a pin lock on it also be easier to hide. Maybe your Work can help you come up with a solution so that she doesn\u2019t get the cash.\n\nAlso try and get as much as you can in writing whether it be via text or a note or some thing. Maybe send her a text and say hey is your friend gonna pay me back my money or are you? And if she replies back and text that you\u2019re not getting your money back at least you\u2019ll have proof that she took your money. This will help if you decide to go to small claims court try and get as much evidence as you can that it was your money.", "That is so sad. Unfortunately this is happening a lot more nowadays. But you have to remember once you\u2019re out of there it will be easier to help your sister if you stay in that situation it\u2019ll be much harder.\n\nIf you can get out on your own and your sister can stay with you that would be the best solution for the Situation. Mom may call the cops but if the cops show up then you can tell them what\u2019s been happening and maybe they can give you some protection and also your sister", "Find out, then contact them", "Once you turn 18 you cannot be forced to stay there doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re still in school or not. In the US at 18 you can leave but make sure you get your money. The other money unfortunately is gone unless you file a police report and then sue her after you leave.\n\nDon\u2019t let her gaslight you. Tell the friend that you\u2019re expecting Your money back. And if you just turned 17 I really think if you have a place to go you can do it cause you can prove financial abuse. If she wants to go to that extent.\n\nDon\u2019t let her abuse you anymore.", "If your mom isn't honest with you, there's no reason to be honest with her. At this point, you might as well consider your situation as being a POW. Say and do what you must to survive, and get to your freedom.\n\nHow old is your sister? Depending on your state and her age, it might be possible for you to take your sister with you. It might also be possible to get legal help getting your money back, sounds to me like the real subreddit you need to be hitting up is the legal advice subreddits. Just like any other POW, sounds like your work needs to be strategic work to save yourself and your cellmate, not much else ethically factors in.\n\nEven if you leave without your sister, you could at least work hard in a more secure environment to create a place your sister can move to as soon as she's able. in some states, you can legally get emancipated at 16 if you can show you're living away from home. You could give your sister that bridge, so your moving our early without her for six months or a year might give her a way to move our and get free years earlier than she would have otherwise, if she's going to be 16 soon.", "Well maybe if CPS does even do a report it might make the mother think twice about what she\u2019s doing. I think you\u2019re right unless you end up in the hospital from physical abuse they really don\u2019t do anything. Sad but true\n\nHowever, if you do leave and get a place on your own let your sister know when things happen she can come to you. You need to get out of there to save yourself and help your sister.\n\nOnce you leave an abusive situation You\u2019ll be able to think more clearly and concentrate on getting yourself better and helping your sister. You won\u2019t be much help to her if you\u2019re all in that seems shitty situation.\n\nSo for both of your sakes move out get your life in order and help your sister out"]}
