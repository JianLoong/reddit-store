{"id": 15863, "submission_id": "131fey9", "title": "AITA For Choosing To Go To My Friend's Wedding Instead Of My Sister's?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (27f) am still getting flack for a decision that I made back in March and I'm starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong, because all of my friends think I'm in the right while most of my family think I'm not.\n\nI have an older sister (32f) \"Jane\" and a best friend \"Laura\" (27f). Growing up Jane and I had two different personalities and didn't mesh well because of it but still had love for each other. Laura, on the other hand, was someone that I met in middle school and during homeroom and our connection as BFFs was instant and with ease. Because of this, in a lot of ways I consider myself to be closer to Laura than I am with Jane but I still love Jane because she is my sister.\n\nDespite not being very close Jane and I had always promised each other that we would be each other's MOH so when I found out that Jane had asked her own BFF to be her MOH shortly after she'd gotten engaged I was a little hurt. However, I did feel that it was slight ridiculous to expect Jane to uphold a childhood promise so I tried not to make a fuss about it. I guess my efforts were in vain because Jane took me out to lunch and explained that while I wasn't going to be in the bridal party she still considered me an important person and how much she would value my presence.\n\nThis all initially happened about two years ago so I've obviously had time to get over it and was elated when Laura asked me to be her MOH. Unlike my sister Laura didn't want anything too big so she and her fianc\u00e9 Jason (30m) decided to opt for just a small wedding and fly out to Hawaii. Jason had a really good job and comes from money so I would be flown out first class and have everything that I needed paid for. The only thing that I'm actually coming out of pocket for is my share of the surprise bachelorette party and a wedding present.\n\nWhen Laura announced her wedding date it was actually going to be a week after Jane's so there was no danger but something happened with the venue and Jane and her fianc\u00e9 had to change their date to the same weekend as Laura's. Jane just mentioned that so casually to me and when she asked me if there was a problem she was surprised when I mentioned Laura's wedding. Something she was aware of. Jane fully expected me to drop out as MOH at Laura's wedding to attend hers with no hesitation.\n\nI told her I had to think about it and Jane went crying to our mom. Nearly everyone in my family is expecting me to attend Jane's wedding instead of Laura's. I told them that I wasn't so quick to leave Laura because unlike Jane's wedding I'm actually apart of the bridal party. I'm being called a petty and spiteful AH, am I?  \n\n\nETA: Since two people have mentioned so far I just wanted to say that the reason why I mentioned how Jason and Laura were flying me out was because I wanted to convey that in addition to being MOH they're spending money on me to be there. They're paying for my flight (to and from), hotel stay, dress, makeup, and she even got me a custom MOH gift.

It\u2019s not your fault that the wedding got moved, and you had already committed to being in your friend\u2019s wedding. Why should you have to miss your friends wedding and why should your friend have to find a new MOH because of your sister\u2019s date change? It sounds like you gladly would have attended both if possible.", "Tough call  \nIn bridal party > guest  \nEarlier arranged date > date that was rescheduled  \nSibs not close enough for Jane to keep MOH promise.  \n\n\nGo to Laura's wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou made a promise and were Maid of Honor. You were part of the main wedding party, in contrast to being a guest. There is often planning involved when it comes to the main wedding party and not a good thing to just drop out of, and a bit more complicated then missing a wedding as a guest.\n\nIt sucks you couldn't go to both, and a can see it as a hard choice as one was your sister while the other was a life long friend, but understand why you chose to go to the one you went to.", "NTA. You're committed to be the MOH at a small destination wedding. Compared to only being a guest at your sister's wedding, being MOH takes precedence. Also, the date was set, and when Jane's date was changed, she knew it was to the same date you'd be away. And Jane didn't care enough to honor your childhood promise *or even* to discuss it with you first.\n\nWhy are they saying you're being petty and spiteful?? Do they think you're going to Laura's wedding as MOH just to get back at Jane for not making you the MOH at *her* wedding? You were planning to go to both, and Jane's was changed. That's not your fault. They could have moved it to a different date if they really wanted you there.", "NTA you're a part of Laura's wedding party, but you're merely a guest of your sister's. You can't make both. You have to prioritize the one with the person you're closer to/have more responsibility with. Plus, Jane's wedding date is the one that changed to a time when you weren't available. You didn't back out of Jane's wedding for Laura's. Jane's plans changed in a way that excludes you.", "NTA Jane changed the date to one where she knew you already had a commitment.", "NTA. Jane showed you how important you were to her when you weren't good enough to even be in the wedding party. Her words about how she still \"considered you an important person\" are just that - words. Actions are what matter. \n\nGo to your friend's wedding and have a great time.", "NTA, this situation sucks. I would hate to have to choose one over the other here. But, I would probably stick to the one that was scheduled first that day. Real shitty situation. I personally don't fault your family for wanting you at your sister's wedding. But I think you're making the lesser of two shitty choices.", "NTA You made a commitment to your friend as the MOH which is kind of important. It's not your fault there was a venue issue. I can understand your sister maybe being a little hurt but it isn't your fault and your not even part of the bridal party.\n\n I'm getting married in a few months and I have a similar relationship with my brother (I don't have any sisters). My BFF is my MOH, I'd understand if my brother couldn't come but if my best friend couldn't be there to support me and dropped out I'd be crushed (and it would mess things up cause shes part of the bridal party)", "NTA your family just seems to have a case of \u201c blood is thicker than water, itis\u201d and lacks the common sense to realize that this is not on you at all. Being maid of honor, trumps being a guest in any wedding, and should always take the priority.  It\u2019s not your fault that your sister had to reschedule and chose to reschedule for the same day as your best friend\u2019s wedding ( do we know for sure that that wasn\u2019t on purpose?) I hope you have a wonderful time at your friend\u2019s wedding!", "It's an invitation not a summons. You're fine. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe date change isn\u2019t your fault. You are allowed to keep commitments over family rescheduling\u2026even for big family events.\n\nUltimately family is who you chose. \nYour decision will likely impact either relationship\u2026so choose the one you most want protected. \n\nSounds like that is yours and Laura\u2019s.\n\nAlso - did your sister HAVE to change the date? And to one you had plans for? Or is this some sort of test?", "NTA\n\nHave fun at Laura's wedding.", "NTA.  Your sisters date was changed. Why should other people suffer that. Stay strong.", "NTA\n\nYou have a prior commitment IN HAWAII! \n\nHave so much fun!", "No you\u2019re not the a h.  Totally don\u2019t miss you\u2019re bff awesome Hawaii thing!  Your fam will get  over it .. are they nuts?", "NTA. You're MOH and they're paying for your expenses. Doesn't make you petty or spiteful at all, you're just honoring your commitment. You're not part of Jane's bridal party whatsoever, you're just an invited guest/family member. It's not anybody's fault Jane lost her venue on her original date, but that doesn't mean she can expect you or anyone else for that matter, to drop everything to attend her wedding.", "The comment about being flown out first class wasn't necessary. That isn't relevant to the story at all. \n\nI'd say NTA. because you originally agreed to both weddings no problem, and it's truly not anyone's fault that the venue had an issue, and the wedding had to be rescheduled. I do think it sucks that they are on the same weekend, however, you are a guest at one and a maid of honor at the other.", "NTA. Jane changed her wedding date to the same day as Laura's wedding. You already made your commitment to Laura. Jane will be well supported that day and you want to honor your promise to Laura to support her and be a witness for her wedding.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "YTA. NTA But it isn\u2019t your fault. I know that sounds odd but  family bonds are\u2014unfairly demanding sometimes.  People would understand prioritizing family in this case. However, most family members would not understand prioritizing your friend over your sister. The negative consequences could be larger than you expect and remain for 40-50 years. I\u2019m sorry the  choices given you create such a conflict.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m so sorry you are in this position. \n\nI think it is fair that you made a commitment to your friend and you will honour that. Be prepared for blow back.
