Growing up Jane and I had two different personalities and didn't mesh well because of it but still had love for each other. Laura, on the other hand, was someone that I met in middle school and during homeroom and our connection as BFFs was instant and with ease. Because of this, in a lot of ways I consider myself to be closer to Laura than I am with Jane but I still love Jane because she is my sister.\n\nDespite not being very close Jane and I had always promised each other that we would be each other's MOH so when I found out that Jane had asked her own BFF to be her MOH shortly after she'd gotten engaged I was a little hurt. However, I did feel that it was slight ridiculous to expect Jane to uphold a childhood promise so I tried not to make a fuss about it. I guess my efforts were in vain because Jane took me out to lunch and explained that while I wasn't going to be in the bridal party she still considered me an important person and how much she would value my presence.\n\nThis all initially happened about two years ago so I've obviously had time to get over it and was elated when Laura asked me to be her MOH. Unlike my sister Laura didn't want anything too big so she and her fianc\u00e9 Jason (30m) decided to opt for just a small wedding and fly out to Hawaii. Jason had a really good job and comes from money so I would be flown out first class and have everything that I needed paid for. The only thing that I'm actually coming out of pocket for is my share of the surprise bachelorette party and a wedding present.\n\nWhen Laura announced her wedding date it was actually going to be a week after Jane's so there was no danger but something happened with the venue and Jane and her fianc\u00e9 had to change their date to the same weekend as Laura's. Jane just mentioned that so casually to me and when she asked me if there was a problem she was surprised when I mentioned Laura's wedding. Something she was aware of. Jane fully expected me to drop out as MOH at Laura's wedding to attend hers with no hesitation.\n\nI told her I had to think about it and Jane went crying to our mom. Nearly everyone in my family is expecting me to attend Jane's wedding instead of Laura's. I told them that I wasn't so quick to leave Laura because unlike Jane's wedding I'm actually apart of the bridal party. I'm being called a petty and spiteful AH, am I?  \n\n\nETA: Since two people have mentioned so far I just wanted to say that the reason why I mentioned how Jason and Laura were flying me out was because I wanted to convey that in addition to being MOH they're spending money on me to be there. They're paying for my flight (to and from), hotel stay, dress, makeup, and she even got me a custom MOH gift.

It's considered (at least in my experience) to be a significant acknowledgement of a close relationship, and is an honour to be asked as it means the bride thinks very highly of you and wants you to be Their Person for one of the most significant moments in their life.\n\nETA: MOH gifts are also not really seen as a motivating factor for people to accept the role.

They're so ridiculous and then interpreting your words as motivated by retaliation instead of a legitimate reason is just nuts. Jane changed the date and you had prior obligations. If she isn't prioritizing you why should you prioritize her?", "No, that's a perfectly valid reason and they're being assholes.", "That comment really did make you come across as petty and passive-aggressive. Really not a good choice of words.\n\nExcept for that NTA. Your sister should expect loosing guests when she changed dates. Also since she was well aware you were already booked that date this falls on your sister not you.", "I\u2019d split my statement and yours.\n\n\u201cNot going to betray my dear friend\u2019s trust after they made me the MOH and I made a commitment to them. I love Jane and am sad I\u2019ll miss her wedding, but unfortunately am not able to be in two places at once.\u201d\n\nAny reference to Jane not making OP the MOH will not work in her favor."]}
