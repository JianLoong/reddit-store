Honestly I would have opted forcefully out of this \"check in\" crap as soon as I moved out. Demanding a selfie every day is not \"checking in.\" Checking in is leaving your gran's for a 10 hour trip on scary ass roads and calling her when you get in safe and alive. Check ins are not group jokey joke selfie chats. Tell your step mom to get stuffed. She sounds controlling if she's gonna get this upset about a grown ass human being not being reachable every single second.   \n\n\nIdea - every time they demand a check in, tell them something shocking. \"Sorry, I was engaging in \\*blisteringly\\* good oral, just then.\" \\*My period cramps and diarrhea toilet selfie!\\*  \"I apologize for not replying IMMEDIATELY but I was popping an ass zit. Damn those suckers splat.\" Just like cross alllllll the lines. Maybe they'll get the hint about crossing \\*your\\* lines.", "You have no obligation to be the equivalent of surgically attached to your phone. You are entitled to use your phone when you feel like it.\n\n**NTA**. Tell them you're not doing the check-in anymore and to take you out of the group or you'll just block them for sending you junk. Also, change your locks and don't give a spare key to anyone you can't trust to use it **only** in an emergency.\n\nIf you can't do the above because extreme conflict avoidance, get therapy until you can. Real life comes with conflict and you need to be in a position to handle it.", "NTA! My sibs and parents and I have a group chat also. Most of us have it muted 24/7! People are at work, and can get fired for phone notifications. We believe in being present with our loved ones and that means ignoring the phone sometimes! And sometimes, we just don\u2019t feel like interacting with them. Reasons I\u2019ve ignored my fam group chat: I\u2019m watching a movie with my kids; I\u2019m cooking dinner; I\u2019m taking a nap; I am enjoying my husband\u2019s company more; a sibling or my mom is annoying me lately; I\u2019d rather play a phone game; I\u2019d rather text my friend chat group; we have friends over;", "NTA.  You're 38!  You don't have to tell anyone what you're doing or where you are unless your employer requires it at work or you're in prison or the military!  One of the few advantages of being 38.\n\nI would remove your spare key from whoever has it.  Hide it somewhere at your parents' house so that you know where to find it but no one else can show up at your house unannounced.\n\nI would make an agreement with them that you'll show signs of life every X days but will ignore the group chat other than that, unless you're in the mood.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult. Whether to participate or not is up to you.\n\nI also understand this on a different level - my family (parents/siblings) will start group texts where the \"humor\" goes directions I'm not interested in, so I \"check out\" of them.  I get it.", "You're 38 years old! You don't have to check in or do what family tells you. Just say NO. And don't let stepmom have a spare key. And mute them or say you're done with group texting.", "NTA  Time to go LC or NC and tell them all in the group text you've had enough for awhile and want some peace and GET YOUR DAMN KEYS BACK!!!", "NTA - mute that shit", "Ugh, family group texts are the worst. I feel ya on not wanting to deal with all that swearing and inside jokes. And honestly, who has time for constant check-ins? NTA in my book.", "NTA at all.  I'd absolutely put my foot down and no longer do a selfie check in and just slowly respond less and less to the group chat.", "NTA but your family sounds insane, and you need to put up some real boundaries You\u2019re 38 years old. You\u2019re not a child. \n\nAs for her sending over your sister with a spare key, change your locks.", "NTA Your family is ridiculously overbearing and nosey. Mute the ocnversation or opt out completely, that's just insane.", "NTA. That is ridiculous. Reminds me of a controlling partner needing to know your every move. I understand checking in if you've gone on holiday or something, but this just seems bizarre to me. Personally, I would say I'm not doing it and mute notifications. It's causing you a lot of stress (totally normal reaction) you've got to do what's best for you.", "NTA,  Girl, just leave the group text. Dang\n\nTake back the spare key too. Put them on an information diet and go low contact for a while.  She will learn to back off. And if not then cut her off completely", "What kind of Brady Bunch fuckery is this nonsense? NTA and leave the group chat. \n\nThis is such middle school bullshit \ud83e\udd23", "Nta your family sounds exhausting", "NTA.  \n\nThis one's easy.  Just ask them to start a new group text without you in it.  Be nice but honest, and just say that a text or two is one thing, but when you're busy, the constant dinging of your phone with texts going back and forth in a group text can get pretty annoying.  Also explain that you will respond to texts as convenient, so you may not respond immediately.", "NTA. I\u2019d remove myself from the group chat.", "Nta. That's unreasonable of them to expect you to drop whatever you're doing to take a selfie.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, not even close. If this was my own mother I'd be questioning her behaviour and calling it out. It's just so attention seeking and narcissistic... And, yeah, they're your family but fucking hell - you don't owe them every second, minute, hour and days of your existence to validate them and give them attention.\n\nI don't know how much to express this, but you're NTA.", "NTA. Not even a little. It's completely ridiculous to request that you drop everything and take a selfie whenever your stepmom feels like it. Even more ridiculous to give you a hard time over it. \n\nKeep the chat muted. Also, if they continue to drop in announced, consider having someone else keep your spare key.", "NTA I would leave that chat on mute and enjoy Netflix and a glass of wine, send the thumbs up emoji once a week and that is all.", "NTA people get busy.  You can\u2019t be expected to be able to drop a \u201ccheck in selfie\u201d at the drop of a hat.  People have lives.  If had been more than a few days sure.  Hours no.  Total overreaction from them.", "NTA\n\nPeople are allowed to put their phones down.", "YTA.\n\nPut your phone on silent ffs.", "Like so, so many of these posts, ESH, though your family less than you. You are an adult. Repeat that to yourself as often as you need to. All you have to do is send one text saying you will not be participating anymore and will be muting all future group chats, and then do it. You are almost 40 years old!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I think I only had to tell my mother once \"picking pus and lint out of my belly button\" before she quit demanding to know exactly what I was doing every minute. \"Digging out an ingrown crotch hair boil\" is also glorious.
