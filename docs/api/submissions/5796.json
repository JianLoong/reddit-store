You're jealous and petty of a 16 year old. The girl sounds amazingly talented and you brought her down. She sounds like more of an adult than you. Grow up", "YTA.\n\nYou had me though for a hot second thinking you actually cared about all the other cousins.  Then you revealed that you also have a kid and it became plainly obvious you're actually just jealous of a 16 year old.  Nobody was stopping you from talking about the good things your kid does, too.  Nobody was stopping you from talking about the good things all the other kids do, too, but interestingly you didn't bother to contribute there.  None of this required you badmouthing another child like you're a teenage mean girl.  Even the other kids behaved better than you.\n\nIs German one of the four languages Mara speaks perchance?  If so, ask her to translate fremdsch\u00e4men for you.", "I was expecting Mara was getting way better gifts and you would be in your right but this was just pathetic", "YTA,\n\nPoor Mara and you're poor kids that have to deal with this embarrassing behavior. You are jealous of a child, grow up.", "YTA. You're jealous of a 16 year old and put her down in front of her. Wow. Please grow up.", "More information needed:\n\nDidnt you post about her a few weeks ago with slightly less blatant seething resentment and jealousy? And in that one you mentioned that her parents had died when she was young and the whole family kinda dotes on her because they are all she really has?\n\nAnd you got raked over the coals as TA.\n\nSo you thought, its because of her tragic backstory, not because I'm dreadfully jealous and its awkwardly obvious....\n\nWell its a bold play cotton. Let's see how it works out for her.", "We lived through years of a Mara only it was a brother and sister that we had to hear about.  It was sort of funny (feel bad saying it)  when neither one of them amounted to anything after years of everyone hearing how amazing they were going to be.  One never graduated from high school and the other barely did and still lives at home doing nothing. Meanwhile the other kids in the family all have great careers.", "YTA.  Wow.  Just, wow.  \n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not your niece\u2019s responsibility to deal with your daughter\u2019s bullies.  If you know your daughter is being bullied and haven\u2019t stopped it, you have more problems than jealousy.", "Sounds like most people are misinterpreting this as jealousy and pettiness. Sounds like Mara is an arrogant little shit who's held high above the clouds by the family. This clear favoritism is corrupting Maras mind, while creating animosity between the children, they probably hate her already. The family is TA, for creating auch a toxic environment and thus harming all of the kids. Mara is as much a victim of this as are the neglected other kids. Talent is worthless if it's not accompanied by humility and self-reflection. And she was never taught this. There were a lot better ways to say it, but the topic had to be breached sooner rather than later and this should not have been the last time it's discussed in the family. Sometimes things have to get uncomfortable before they can begin to get better. NTA", "ESH As the \u201cMara\u201d in my family it\u2019s not fun being the measuring stick and the pressure that goes along with it. This was done by other family members not my parents. I didn\u2019t know about the measuring contest until I was in my 20s but luckily I don\u2019t think cousins that I actually like held that against me. My parents didn\u2019t brag, put down other family members or allowed my head to become overinflated but would bring accomplishments up briefly because they were proud. Though I would get embarrassed over feeling smug. Favoritism is a crap thing to do with kids and I can see this blowing up into their faces later on because the kids growing up will be living in Mara\u2019s shadow and compared to her or their accomplishments downplayed. Since OP is bias in this situation I\u2019m not entirely sure if Mara is being smug and arrogant but the pressure of expectations  may get to her down the road if her family can\u2019t live vicariously through her as someone to brag about if she chooses to do things \u201cnot interesting enough\u201d or \u201cfalls off the horse\u201d.", "YTA. Don't try to turn the conversation and make it about you/yours. It's not a good look on anyone.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your niece's fault that she was getting praised.  Also, \"taking an interest\" in something isn't really something they can have much of a conversation about.", "YTA. \nYes they talk about the one kid, but ya know what, who cares? She obviously is trying to be the center of attention. Either that or her parents push her to do all those things or she feels she has to to get any appreciation. Either way, just focus on your own kids and make sure they feel loved, another persons child, or how much other people talk about a child is not your problem", "YTA and you need to work on that very wide streak of jealousy you\u2019ve got going on.", "YTA. As someone who grew up as the family Mara, it\u2019s super stressful and puts a ton of pressure on you as a kid. What you take as smug, is probably a kid that doesn\u2019t know how to take in so much attention. If she\u2019s talented, she\u2019s talented, she shouldn\u2019t be made out as a bad guy. Sounds like your misdirecting your anger towards Mara when in your post \u201ceveryone\u201d aka the adults in the room are the ones discussing Mara\u2019s accomplishments. Your grip (a petty one at that) is with the adults in the family, not Mara.", "ESH\n\nIt's never good form to put other people down.\n\nAt the same time the other kids should get praise too.  The fact that the family focuses on one child is completely obtuse.\n\nNot to mention that the constant praise actually puts pressure on Mara.  She probably overachieves because she is expected to.  (I say this as a chronic overachiever).  She probably would appreciate a break from the constant focus.\n\nI would have relentlessly brought up the accomplishments of the other children in conversation until the other family members caught on.\n\nOR if they don't pick up on social and conversational cues, spoken to the other adults in private.\n\nI understand you got frustrated OP, but this was not handled well.   When frustrated it is better to regroup mentally and not speak until you do.", "Can you show us on the doll where Mara touched you?\n\nYes, YTA. A very petty, jealous AH.", "YTA. And regarded.", "If this isn\u2019t just a rehash of a post from a few weeks ago, YTA.\n\nLike, UNBELIEVABLY YTA. \n\nThere is a shit ton of secondhand embarrassment radiating from this post and the jealousy you have for a literal child. Pull yourself together OP and get a better grasp over how you feel in these types of situations. These are the types of people that others don\u2019t wanna be around and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people don\u2019t want to invite you around to events like this.\n\nAct your age.", "YTA", "I agree with you OP.\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole!\n\nThank you for recognizing this and bringing attention to this because this can really damage the other kid\u2019s mental health.", "YTA. You absolutely could have said nothing. You tried steering the conversation away, and it didn't work. You could have turned and started a second conversation with the person next to you and ignored the conversation about Mara. You could have asked if anyone had seen any good movies lately. There are loads and loads of things you could have done, and should practice doing in the future.", "YTA and a weirdo for being jealous of a child. lol\n\nOn another note, why was she playing baseball? It\u2019s not baseball season. This feels like a lie and is extremely similar to a story someone shared around Thanksgiving.", "YTA\u2026 be honest, if it was your child that everyone was gloating about, you wouldn\u2019t have wanted the subject changed\ud83d\ude12 And worse: you said this IN FRONT of Mara. Lady, you\u2019re vile and your kids probably got so much second hand embarrassment from your stunt. Your husband\u2019s right, you should\u2019ve just sat there and been quiet.", "YTA for being jealous of your niece. You want her to be less than her full potential?  I\u2019m assuming you embarrassed TF out of your kids.", "Oh boy!!!  YTA, and I hope you did not have your outburst in front of Mara.", "Can we spare some attention for the OTHER people who felt secondhand embarrassment? Because I cringed a LOT more than you did. I actually came top of cringing.", "Can you show us on the doll where Mara touched you?\n\nYes, YTA. A very petty, jealous AH.", "I think ESH! The adults were showing clear favoritism, but OP attacked a child instead of attacking the behavior of the adults! She came off as very jealous, even though she did have a point.", "There's a German word for that: Fremdscham", "She tried to bring Mara down, and then centered the conversation on HER kid.", "I agree, if it isn\u2019t bothering the other kids then this woman is just straight up jealous of a child.", "Or, she could write it, sensibly and calmly, in an e-mail to everyone.  That way she could make sure the didn't come off as bitter and angry.", "So OP knows their kid is getting bullied and isn\u2019t doing anything about it, but expects another kid to?", "She mastered four languages", "Well then again u were 40 soooo.....", "This really doen't sound like Mara does anything.  OP is projecting, but never has given an example of something bad Mara has actually done", "If I were the husband (or the kids) I\u2019d be mortified.", "Me too. Yikes is an understatement", "When I started to read this I wondered why it was reposted", "This made me cackle and neither of my cats appreciated it hahahaha", "Are they though? I mean it could be true, but I often find that adults who fixate on the \"quantity of attention\" that various people receive relative to each other are not the most reliable narrators.\n\nIt's telling that OP doesn't give any concrete examples of her children being disregarded- she literally only describes annoyance over folks *talking* about Mara \"too much\". If she'd said: \"Extended Family *always* attends Mara'a softball games but didn't show up for my daughter's science fair\" or: \"Mara received tons of great Christmas gifts from Extended Family while my daughter only got a few smaller ones\" I might agree that there was an actual problem. Based on the info we have, OP just gets annoyed whenever Mara is the topic of conversation.\n\nETA: also OP never specifies the other kid's ages.

Damn you can\u2019t be happy for anyone", "I don't think the issue you have with her is that everyone talks about her. \n\nI think you're jealous of a 16 year old, you've convinced yourself it's all about the kids.

Or are you going through something right now that impacts your confidence?\n\nI understand that overall, it's important to maybe have a discussion with the adults and say you're worried that because Maria is a high achiever the other kids might feel like they don't get as much attention when their accomplishments are mentioned. So maybe in family settings if any of the kids bring up any achievements, as a family you can hype them up and give them attention.  Then go back to Maria and her accomplishments. \n\nYTA in this situation. But I think there are issues here that need to be addressed by everyone but in private.
