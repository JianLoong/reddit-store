I just use it at home since the tumbler itself is great, but the logo looks awful.", "NTA. \n\nIf you were clear about this, she overstepped.

She asked, you gave her a rational reason on why you didn't want her to do it, she ignored your wishes, it looks like crap and you're the bad guy?

Small businesses need to put extra thought into how they represent themselves. It\u2019s not a hobby, it\u2019s your business. She needs to grasp that it\u2019s more complicated than it seems.

Your logo. Period.\n\nI work at a Fortune 100 where the look and feel of the logo is front and center. The corporate standard PowerPoint template distorts our logo (for internal presentations) and marketing flipped shit about it even though it\u2019s not customer facing.

Maybe \"she means well\", but she's doing a terrible job of showing it", "[deleted]", "She did something he specifically asked her not to do. That's not supportive.

Who wants their business represented by some crappy, half-assed logo?  \n\nThis is part of the reason clothing companies sue knockoff brands.  They really don't want anyone mistaking that folex watch that broke in an hour with their Rolex.", "NTA\n\nNope, this is about branding and how your business is represented.  That stuff *matters* for a business.  The offer to order her a shirt with her name on it is and always was entirely appropriate.  Why when presented with this offer in the first place she decided she had to have some weird bootleg made is beyond me.", "NTA.  You told her no.  She didn't listen.  She doesn't get to wear her cheap shirt.  She needs to understand boundaries.  No means no.  No doesn't mean she gets to do it, anyway and then guilt you about it afterward.", "As someone who tan a buisness for 15 years, be controlling, it's your fucking buisness. \n\nUnless you are paying someone to make decisions for you then you will always be the one making choices and dealing with the outcomes, and everyone will know exactly what you should do, while having nothing invested and no idea of what else their idea will affect", "NAH. You think this matters, but I promise you it doesn't.  I literally had this exact same thing situation happen fifteen years ago.  It's just a shirt and she was just trying to support you.  No one is going to judge your company because of her shirt.

I would never want to alter it or get another person to replicate it. Weird scenario.", "NTA. That is not being a control freak. That is being cautious and meticulous of your brand new business.

But she doesn't realize how serious this is to you that you look one way. It is just fun and games to her, something she can play around with.", "NAH, She meant well but got it wrong.

She tried to support and surprise you but unlucky for her, she couldn't do it too good but she didn't wear it or show to anyone so no harm done.

It seems like she\u2019s trying to get you to use her friends business by showing how well her friend can do but she can fuck off with these games.", "Well you should not have gone off on her.  You should have just had it ordered - you cannot sit here and tell me you don\u2019t know your girlfriend and the fact that she would have wanted one - you should have ordered it from the get go.

That would've avoided this all together", "NAH\n\nBut you will be if you don't drop it.\n\nShe has loving intentions. Even though she's an adult she will be disappointed much like a 5 yr old that you wouldn't hang their picture on the fridge. Even though she didn't make it it was her idea with love. If you make more comments this may be the beginning of the end of your relationship as you don't love her. Depending on her self-worth. But if you say nothing if it is as bad as you say people will talk and they will let her know the value of the shirt.

Her shirt will get attention, and that's what you want, right?  Don't destroy someone's self-esteem because you don't like her shirt.", "Honestly, a gentle YTA, she's wrong here, but it sounds like she really just wants to support you and you did say you'll get her one, and you didn't.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a graphic designer, so I understand the importance of your own designs, and any butchering of them is considered a death sentence, but you didn't get the shirt you promised.", "What does your logo look like? As a graphic designer that would confirm if you\u2019re in the arsehole territory. I\u2019ve seen so many people bring what they think are good designs and they\u2019re not.", "NTA, it's your business & 1st impressions are very important. Your logo represents you & if you're not happy with the version she has obtained, then you are within your rights to reject it. Tell her you're pleased she is supporting you & really appreciate it, but that your sorry, but the t-shirt she got wasn't a true representation of your logo & not from an approved supplier. You are happy with the version you have & feel it represents your business better & you had told her you will get her a t-shirt from that supplier.", "NTA - but you GF is being AH because you directly asked her not to do what she did. You were willing to order her one with her name on it. She disrespected you and your business. This is a red flag for me because if she is willing to do this over a shirt. What else is she willing to do this on then what else would she do in the name  of supporting you??", "NTA! She needs to understand how important this is to you. That said, let her know you\u2019re grateful for her interest.", "NTA\n\nYour GF overstepped.  There is no excuse for it.", "NTA.\n\nAll businesses must have a brand, and you offered to buy your gf a t-shirt.", "NTA. She essentially bootlegged/knocked off your design and had someone else make it for her. That is not being supportive of you, nor is that cool from an intellectual property standpoint. It makes your brand look worse and lower quality. You have offered to get her an official one made - that is more than a reasonable compromise.", "Is your whole business model built around 2 t-shirts? Will those shirts give you a life of love and support? Just order her a shirt and stop being a jerk. A partner who values you and your endeavors is better than anything.", "NTA branding isn\u2019t just a fun thing you do to show you \u201cmade it\u201d in whatever you\u2019re doing. Proper branding, for example a logo, is a source identifier which tells consumers \u201cthis thing comes from x\u201d and if x is good and trustworthy then the thing gets the benefit of that source identifier. This is what is commonly known as a trademark and it must be used continuously to mark goods and/or services that actually originate from that source. One of the requirements of trademark protection (whether you register it or not - though you should register it if you ever need to enforce your rights in it) is that you HAVE to exercise control and approval over its use. If you let someone use it or let them use it without restrictions, your trademark can be watered down or revoked. So, you can gently explain to your girlfriend that you really appreciate the sentiment but you\u2019re trying to build a brand and in order to properly establish and protect it you have to make sure it\u2019s used only on officially created goods and it has to be identical to the branding every time. So unfortunately for this you do need to go though the official t-shirt company using your high quality logo specs because it ensures it\u2019s done identically and is protectable.\n\nCongrats on your business OP!", "Definitely NTA. She asked and you said no, period.", "NTA. You are absolutely not the AH, your girlfriend is.
