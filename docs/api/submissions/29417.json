Maybe try to explain this to her and let her know you want her support but in a way that properly represents you and your business. I had a very similar problem with my mom and my small business venture. I had a name set up and an instagram and she went out of her way to make me cards with a completely different name and color scheme. Once I explained that it wasn\u2019t the image or branding I wanted for myself, but still appreciated her support, she got it and apologized.", "Nta branding is very specific and at the end of the day it's Your Business not a hobby it has to be taken seriously. Don't feel guilty set maintain & standards.", "NTA. Its your business and your branding. She didnt have to, and really shouldnt of overstepped there, even if she was trying to be helpful. Especially since she asked and you said no", "NTA - you are starting a brand and need your new shirts for work. There is zero reason why she can't respect that these are your work shirts and wait a paycheck until you buy her one of her own. Ignoring you to do whatever she wants is not being \"supportive\", it's just selfishness disguised as eagerness.", "NTA.  Marketing and branding are both very specific things and you don't want your logo out there looking like crap.  I get it.  A friend of mine made this tumbler for me to carry to job fairs with my company logo on it.  It looks awful.  I just use it at home since the tumbler itself is great, but the logo looks awful.", "NTA. \n\nIf you were clear about this, she overstepped. It's your company, you have a vision in mind for what the branding is. You *should* get to control that part.", "NTA\n\nHow could you possibly be the AH? She asked, you gave her a rational reason on why you didn't want her to do it, she ignored your wishes, it looks like crap and you're the bad guy? From your comments, it's been a week - why the rush to wear the shirt. \n\nShe has a screwed-up way of wanting to support you. Is she insecure that you are creating something of your own that does not involve her?\n\nTime to set some boundaries between your business and her \"help\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sometimes when people really want to support you, but are doing it in the wrong way, they just need to be told what they could do that would be genuinely helpful and will be happy to run with it.", "NTA \n\nYou were clear on reasoning. Sounded like she was so excited to support you that it became about her need to support instead of focusing on what you actually needed and desired.", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t go to Gucci and say \u201cI made a Gucci shirt just to support you\u201d so she needs to put some respect on you business and get the one you were going to have made for her from the beginning.", "INFO\n\n> she asked if I got one for her.

You said horrible but that\u2019s very subjective and this is your post so I don\u2019t think we can get a third party here unless she herself admits the shirt was bad. If it was bad NTA, if it was mediocre, YTA. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt because it\u2019s your business and reputation, so having it look bad can reflect on you.", "NTA. Small businesses need to put extra thought into how they represent themselves. It\u2019s not a hobby, it\u2019s your business. She needs to grasp that it\u2019s more complicated than it seems. Also, all she had to do it wait for a new one.", "Absolutely NTA. This is your business and you're wise to be careful with how it's marketed.\n\nIt's sweet of her to want to support you, but she should have listened to you.", "NTA.  Branding is a huge deal.", "NTA she went behind your back and bastardized your company logo. She's the one being toxic, tell her if she wears it in public, you'll sue her friend for unlawful use of your company logo lol", "NTA\n\nAt all. Branding and having a consistent look and feel can be crucial in building an image.\n\nIt may seem like a small thing to your gf, but it\u2019s pretty unprofessional to wear t-shirts that distort your logo.\n\nAlso, your company. Your logo. Period.\n\nI work at a Fortune 100 where the look and feel of the logo is front and center. The corporate standard PowerPoint template distorts our logo (for internal presentations) and marketing flipped shit about it even though it\u2019s not customer facing. You just don\u2019t fuck with company logos.", "A week.\n\nI asked to wait til I got paid because I didn\u2019t have money to spend on them. Which is why I only had the two for myself.", "It\u2019s not subjective. Other people\u2019s opinions don\u2019t matter. As the brand owner and logo designer he sets the rules on how his logo should be represented. It could be almost perfect but with the wrong shade of colour and he\u2019d be totally within his right to say it\u2019s not suitable to represent his business.", "Have you offered to let her wear one of yours for the time being? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not wearing both at once.", "Yes lol.\n\nThey get dirty/stained is the only reason I ordered two at all.", "Why can't she be an adult and wait a week or two? Why does op have to share their brand new work shirts? Can't op just have something new for work without having to share?", "No one said he has to lol\n\nBut relationships are about compromise and if his main concern is avoiding an argument & her not wearing that shirt, letting her borrow one of his is a fine compromise", "No, relationships are about respect, not just compromise. She has no respect for him in this situation. She wants what he's clearly using. She won't wait a paycheck to let op buy one for her. She won't listen when op was clear that second-hand logos weren't ok. \n\n\n\nShe's spoiled and selfish. Maybe \"she means well\", but she's doing a terrible job of showing it", "Literally how is she spoiled & selfish? She went out of her way to solve the \u201cproblem\u201d herself by literally making a shirt so her bf didn\u2019t need to spend more money. A shirt she wanted for the sole purpose of supporting him.", "She did something he specifically asked her not to do. That's not supportive. If she wanted to do it in a supportive way, she could have offered to pay for the order instead of having her friend make a shitty imitation."]}
