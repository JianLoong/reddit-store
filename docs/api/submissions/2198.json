The best thing now would be to help your parents see how your brother can thrive in the things he's passionate about so that they can help you. They shouldn't be mad at you especially if they enrolled you when you were his age and you're the one who paid for it. Honestly, there are worse ways to disobey your parents.", "NTA. You did a great thing for him.", "NTA, Your parents are bad people! (Not a whole judgement, but just in this situation) I can understand perhaps a small amount of hesitation at paying a fee for any examination, but seeing as they paid it for you there is no reason not to help your brother. They should be exited that he is interested in aspects of his education, god knows I\u2019m not interested in mine. What you did was incredible and if I was in his place I would be proud to have such a great sister. Your parents are entirely out of pocket for being mad at you here.", "NTA you are an amazing older brother!!! So glad he has you, you'll be helping him more through his life.", "The only thing I see you doing wrong here is telling your parents before the exam.

Failure to agree happens from time to time.

She gave told her brother she'd pay for it and gave him an incentive to do so.", "Filling the forms for him give me the impression you had to forge names....", "NTA. You're a great sister for listening to your brother's wants and showed him that you actually have his interests in mind, while your parents does the opposite by saying that they don't believe he can do something just because they've decided that he can't, when they have evidence of the opposite.", "Info: are there consequences for doing badly on this exam?", "NTA!  You did something nice for your brother.  Why should it matter if he excels at this examination?  The fact that he is asking to take it should be enough.

He want know unless he tries, and its good you supported him in wanting to take the exam. Parents like to think we know what's best in all things. They will get over it.

Which a lot of autistic people are.\n\nIt sounds like your parents are just writing him off. Maybe he won\u2019t do great in all subjects. But he could do really well at math and by extension sciences. Perhaps he could have a future as a mathematician or physicist.", "NTA, your actually doing more for him than your parents are. My son is on the spectrum so I understand how he's good at math but bad at testing. (Story of our Iives). I hope he finds the support he needs. Never give up on him.", "I think you are amazing and you care about your brother. Your parents need to chill out.", "NTA and it's possible he's dyslexic. \n\nI always excelled at logic and anything with an example. Completely failed at remembering formulas or reciting times tables or not counting on my fingers. It wasn't for lack of trying but I can see how it seemed that way. \n\nI skipped questions too. I was also thought of as bad at school until around high school when a teacher took an interest. Ended up with all A's apart from maths and physics which I completely failed.", "Nta unless he has a apa or other help at school. The exam might eliminate his eligibility if he does to well.", "The Brother told them, not OP?", "NTA. All your parents are doing is enforcing the fact that your brother won\u2019t be able to do anything in life because he\u2019s autistic. He\u2019s going to remember for the rest of his life that YOU let him do the test because YOU BELIEVED HE WAS SMART ENOUGH. You\u2019re doing a way bigger deed than you realize and I hope your parents smarten up.", "NTA and your brother might do really well on the test. If he is gifted in that way but unacknowledged, then his teachers might be able to do more for him. (I have a kid who is gifted in that way and he tests as 2x his age in logical reasoning. His teacher gave him a test in it and when she got the results, she was blown away. She came up with a million ideas of how to tap into that.)", "Okay, I misread that somehow.

So this should be something he'll excel at so their comment doesnt make sense. And even if he doesn't excel, there's nothing wrong with letting him try since he wants to.", "NTA you are an awesome big sister! You are making a difference in your brother's life. Your parents may not like it, but you are doing the right thing.", "NTA.", "NTA. If he's shown he's good at it, why shouldn't he get a shot at it?", "NTA\n\nYour brother might be neurodivergent but that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve the same opportunities to excel everyone else gets. I'm glad you gave him that opportunity.", "NTA, we're able to sign him up without their permission, it seems like their permission was not needed. It was your money to spend and given that they are actively trying to hold your brother back, it seems in his best interests for someone to be advocating that he should be given a chance to try", "OP says she was always enrolled for it so I think you're right, it's not the fee. The parents just don't think their son will do well so they see it as a waste which is like bad parenting 101, expect you're kid to fail and never even give them a chance to succeed.", "NTA  As someone with autism, his parents shouldn't hold him back. Your being an amazing sister to him and giving him better confidents that his parents can't give him. Plus its your money so i don't see why your parents would be bothered.", "Is there a benefit to doing well on it? I've never heard of this kind of test before.", "NTA. It is wonderful that you're supporting your brother.  \n\nYou may want to read a little about ADHD.  Some of his challenges you mentioned like skipping questions are very common with ADHD.  In spite of the name, many kids with ADHD are not hyperactive, so don't let that be a reason to say he doesn't have it.\n\n[Autism, ADHD and Highly Gifted have heavily overlapping symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/x4x0xw/adhd_autism_and_giftedness/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
