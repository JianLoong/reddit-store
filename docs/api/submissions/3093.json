There are apps like TalkingParents for tracking these conversations as him agreeing then at the last minute changing his mind is usually frowned on in court. Mediation and an app like that will help you keep it away from your son so he gets less trauma (and yes, of course therapy for him would be smart). I'm not going to call you an AH based on what's written here, and if he's as abusive as he sounds that adds a whole extra layer of confusion to your situation... but if it's closing in on a year you should be locking this down and getting your long term game plan in place to protect all of you, which will also in many ways protect your ex as well.", "ESH but mostly you should worry about you sucking bc you know he sucks.

Stop fighting in front of your son, stop crying uncontrollably in front of him, stop making him aware of your grown-up troubles. He is 6 and should have never felt the need to defend you to his father. This is a failing on both of your parts and you both need to get your shit together before you wreck you child.

Shock and not speaking up in the moment is not equivalent to actively trying to interfere in a parent/child relationship.  Please consider counseling for your son to help him deal with his feelings surrounding the divorce. Second, have your discussions away from the kids.

I have very little sympathy for anyone in this entire situation except for these poor kids. I\u2019m giving OP the serious side eye here. The crying and begging in front of these poor kids should never happen. I suspect we don\u2019t have the whole story. Even if we do, she is not doing a good enough job of maintaining emotional stability. If she needs to cry, fine. That\u2019s all good. But that needs to happen in private.
