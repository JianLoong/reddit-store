If you, as a parent, what to allege abuse or say the other parent is harming the child is any way, you need to be ready to demonstrate a laundry list of things you\u2019ve done to mitigate it - such as what is listed above - along with several instances of you putting yourself in danger to protect the kid. The \u201cbattered woman\u201d defense / \u201cI froze\u201d doesn\u2019t work in family court as it makes you sound like you\u2019re not all there.", "OP is saying absolutely nothing about abuse here, how do you people immediatly get to the point where the only reason OP and her ex could be fighting is because the ex is abusive?", "Yes, and, there's nothing HERE to indicate that.", "You don't know my ex then, they could easily go from a waterfall of tears to smiling in less then a minute. Manipulative people can easily do it (not that i think OP is one just pointing out that people can switch emotions easily)", "I work in child safety. This is not accurate.\n\nChildren, even at age six, are more than capable of grasping that adults have serious disagreements. I don't think that it's appropriate to dither back and forth about stuff like this and that parents should be careful not to paint the other parent in a bad light if the disagreement is literally just a disagreement and not one parent attempting to manipulate or mistreat the other parent or the child.\n\n_Both_ parents are absolutely responsible for modeling healthy problem solving. Both parents are also responsible for translating those disagreements and providing children with a safe and healthy place to talk about big feelings (including being scared if you overhear mom and dad disagreeing).\n\nOne of the more troubling things I see is when adults blame someone who is being abused or mistreated for allowing their child to see them be upset or hurt by this abuse or mistreatment, and a lot of the comments here go awfully close to that. \n\nThere's also a tendency to blame parents, especially mothers, for not placating and going along with the person they are disagreeing with just that the kids don't see the disagreement.\n\nIt's a fine line, and a complicated issue. But 6 or 7 is when they are definitely grasping a decent amount about adults and conflict.", "They had plans for a certain thing to happen. The father came in, unilaterally announced that the plan would not be happening, and the mother cried and begged. When one person cries and begs because of the actions of another, the natural human inclination is to side with the cry/begger. And if a six year old says he's tired of daddy being mean to mommy, that generally means daddy has been mean to mommy in his presence before. At least in his eyes, and kids see a lot more than we give them credit for.", "In which case it is neither the mother nor the child's fault.", "You honestly don't deserve to be down voted \n\nThis is a real example of why less men report domestic violence and abuse \n\nBecause people try to shame them into silence and pretend it doesn't happen", "I don't understand why people are downvoting this are men supposed to just let their abusive partners harm them??", "That's not about image. It's actually caring about their childrens mental health to stand up to abuse.", "I think its healthy for children to see people's real emotions, and reactions to things. If someone does something shitty, and makes you feel bad a kid seeing you just take it/not having a real reaction to it might make them think the shitty behavior isn't a bad thing.", "We call that room the basement, the front yard or sometimes the driveway. Even better use a Wendy\u2019s and make a rule that we don\u2019t talk about co-parenting during pick up/drop off, on the phone only.  Schedule it.  It\u2019s not hard, people do it all the time.  It\u2019s one of the things they will suggest if you ask \u201cmy ex and I don\u2019t always communicate well, how do we make this best on lil Alice?\u201d\n\nIf she had a new friend from work over in the next room she would have told baby daddy \u201cnows not a good time\u201d and gotten in to it later.  Show your kid the same respect by not getting into it in front of them", "Thank you for this.", "That's a ton of assumptions you're making here.", "If the father is also abusing the child, then she should have him in court, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Im not seeing how, if the child isn\u2019t also being abused, your response is nothing more than for image. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t get a pass for choosing a shitty partner as much as it sucks.\n\nYour kid doesn\u2019t need to see you yell back at their other parent when they don\u2019t know what the hell is going on anyways, when you can easily take the conversation outside. It\u2019s foolish to think they\u2019ll take anything from it at that age except that their parents hate eachother.", "Are these not things that can be taught to kids without actively causing animosity towards the other parent? At the age of 6, if the child is saying these things this is happening consistently. Literally just irresponsible at that point. Have grown up conversations away from your 6 year old child and save the life lessons for a day they\u2019ll actually understand.", "I'm literally quoting the post.", "Oook, but why are you putting all of that on the mothers?? Why wasn't it on the father for agreeing to OPs plans, then changing his mind last minute  and confronting her in person as said plans were supposed to happen thus making her cry? It sounds like they have had an unhealthy relationship in front of their child already. I agree that kids shouldn't even have to be around that. That's just not going to happen most of the time as emotions hit whenever they want to, and let's be honest most people don't have great emotional regulation even as adults.", "Men can absolutely be abused the same as women. The problem is that men being abused isn't the topic here. EVERY TIME a woman is talking about something a man did to them there are comments \"well men too\" deflecting from the topic at hand. If you're up in arms about the woes of men go make a post about it. This \"whataboutism\" on someone else's post is why you're getting downvoted."]}
