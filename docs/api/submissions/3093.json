This is not accurate.\n\nChildren, even at age six, are more than capable of grasping that adults have serious disagreements. I don't think that it's appropriate to dither back and forth about stuff like this and that parents should be careful not to paint the other parent in a bad light if the disagreement is literally just a disagreement and not one parent attempting to manipulate or mistreat the other parent or the child.\n\n_Both_ parents are absolutely responsible for modeling healthy problem solving. Both parents are also responsible for translating those disagreements and providing children with a safe and healthy place to talk about big feelings (including being scared if you overhear mom and dad disagreeing).\n\nOne of the more troubling things I see is when adults blame someone who is being abused or mistreated for allowing their child to see them be upset or hurt by this abuse or mistreatment, and a lot of the comments here go awfully close to that. \n\nThere's also a tendency to blame parents, especially mothers, for not placating and going along with the person they are disagreeing with just that the kids don't see the disagreement.\n\nIt's a fine line, and a complicated issue. But 6 or 7 is when they are definitely grasping a decent amount about adults and conflict.", "They had plans for a certain thing to happen.

Human behavior doesn't exist in a vacuum. If a 6-year-old sees his father treating his mother badly and repeatedly making her upset, his feelings *should* be affected.
