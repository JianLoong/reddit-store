One of them I have a good relationship with and the other one, let's call him [M38] Kyle, is a real pain in the ass. When I first started dating my wife, I thought he was just an overprotective brother, but then it went too far.\n\nKyle is very fond of my wife, I mean his sister. I don't mean anything bad, their love is brother and sister love and nothing weird, but he loves her way too much. He's addicted to her, he idolizes her. And he could never forgive me for \"stealing\" his sister. Kyle even has his own wife and life, but he continues to hate me and thinks there are guys in the world more deserving of his sister than me. \n\nHe tells me all of this right to my face. He can't stand me so much that he treats my kid worse than his brother's kids. He gives gifts to his brother's kids but not mine. One time my daughter was visiting him with my other brother-in-law's sons and she came back upset. I asked what was wrong and she said that Uncle Kyle gave the boys ice cream for dessert, but not her. I would love to cut off my daughter's interaction with her Uncle Kyle, but my wife insists that he is her relative and he is \"just jealous\". \n\nI can't write what happened last month or I'll get blocked, but I will say that in December, there was another altercation between Kyle and I that resulted in my broken laptop. \n\nAfter that, I decided that I would cut off all relations with Kyle. His wife had a baby a couple days ago. \n\nMy wife asked me what I would give his baby at the party Kyle was throwing. I told her I wasn't giving anything to Kyle or his baby. I said I wasn't coming to Kyle's party at all. My wife insisted that I had to show up to the party and give a gift. \n\nI said I wouldn't do it for two reasons. First, Kyle never gives gifts to my daughter. Second, Kyle broke my laptop and even if I wanted to give the stupid gift, I wouldn't have enough money because I have to buy a new laptop. \n\nMy wife doesn't understand this and keeps saying that Kyle just has a hard temper, that he's just jealous, that I should treat him with understanding. \n\nAm I really an asshole?", "created_utc": 1704304347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xp8ox/aita_for_not_giving_a_gift_to_my_brotherinlaws/", "score": 1409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her brother is not only mean to you, her husband, but also takes his grievances out on YOUR child.

Her behavior towards Kyle is not normal or okay. She has let him treat you like carp for years, and never stood up to him or shut it down. She expects you to still spend time with him even though it sucks for you. Basically, she puts Kyle's feelings first as more important than yours. She lets Kyle get away with awful behavior but expects a complete double standard from you where you treat him with respect and gifts. This is fudnemtnally unfair and shows a lack of respect for you.\n\nWorse, your wife is a bad mother. She's so far up Kyle's asshole (which they both are) that she lets her daughter be treated as second rate and made to feel bad. This is especially not normal. Most mothers would at least love their own kids enough to stand up to them, or not send them to Uncle's house to watch the other kids eat ice cream while they got none, etc. \n\nYour wife loves Kyle more then you or your kid. She treats him better and puts him first. And you've just allowed this for years? \n\n1. Show your wife this thread\n\n2. Tell your wife you need to see a marriage counselor together \n\n3.

If she's old enough (like 4+) talk to her about how Uncle Kyle  makes her feel when he gives things to her cousins and not her. Ask her if she had a good or bad time at Uncle Kyle's. Ask her if she wants to go back? Then use this when you talk to your wife. If you and your wife disagree on visits to uncle Kyle, talk to your daughter about how it's okay for her to say that's not fair or not want to go. And that if she ever dosen't want to go to Uncle Kyle's she can always hang out with you instead, you'll give her ice cream and do fun stuff with her so she dosen't miss out. Any time wife wants to take her, double check and ask her if hse wants to go. \n\nAnd most importantly, validate your daughter's feelings. Tell her \"That wasn't nice of uncle Kyle. I'm sorry he treated you that way. It wasn't fair. It makes me sad when Uncle Kyle is mean to me too. Do you want a hug?\" or whatever. That said, if she is happy to go to Uncle Kyle and your wife wants to take her you also shouldn't tell her to be unhappy about it. Don't tell your daughter how to feel. Keep communication open by being the parent who cares about and accepts her feelings. If she wants to go say \"Okay, have fun. And remember, you're my favorite kid in the world and just as good and special as your cousins.\" And smile. Don't try to get her to be sad about it.", "Wow your wife is okay with her brother mistreating her child.  \n\nKyle is a AH but SO IS SHE. \n\nIt's not only Kyle who has unhealthy relationship with his sister, it's her as well.   \n\nThey something seriously messed up between them.", "All of these comments!

I would honestly have an issue with the entire family at this point. Someone needs to step in and put a stop to his sh!t. Especially if a child is being bullied & mistreated. And make no mistake, that is exactly what is happening.", "NTA.\n\nBut you will be if you let this carry on. \n\nDude. OP. You have a wife problem. I know what this is like from the experience of the daughter. Situation being slightly different, is that my Mum's older brother hates everyone, including his sister. He competes in a competition that only he participates in. But he used to go around insulting me and my brothers, because he felt his kids were better than my mother's, and felt they should get all the attention. He'd get mad when he didn't. He absolutely hates me. He used to buy presents for his younger brother's kids, not his sister's kids. All the same schtick. \n\nBelieve me when I tell you, it's not just whether he gives presents or ice cream to your daughter. The kind of hate that involves treating your kid this way, means he's also saying nasty things to her, or about her, behind your backs. This behaviour is not just what you see, or what your daughter tells you about. It's what goes on that your daughter DOESN'T tell you too. My older Uncle spent years telling my whole extended family that I had special needs. He never bought me a birthday or Christmas gift. He'd walk into my birthday celebrations, that were held at my grandparents' home, and grab food and cake, and never wish me a happy birthday. He walked into my graduation party for my Bachelors degree, didn't greet anyone, and went to take food my mother paid for. Loaded down a plate and tried to run off. My grandmother lost her mind, and told him he either had to congratulate me and greet everyone, or he wasn't getting food. He stormed out, after dumping the food on the floor. \n\nMy Mum used to fight him about the things she saw and heard. But there was so much she didn't hear. Your wife is just as culpable as her brother, if she allows your daughter to be abused because 'he's just jealous'. Believe me. This treatment will go on, and get worse, because no one is stopping it. And your daughter will remember this, and she will ask you why, when she's old enough. \n\nYOU are also culpable, if you don't stop this. If your wife isn't interested in stopping this, she can go see her brother by herself. There's no reason for you to let your daughter go to be abused, while you stay at home. You have a choice. Give your wife two options. If she wants to carry on letting her brother abuse your daughter, then divorce. Because enabling is abuse. If she's okay with the way your shared daughter is treated by her brother, she's not worthy of being a parent. If she's willing to work on your marriage, you both go to see a couple's and family therapist. Because your daughter probably needs that right now too. And until your wife can set boundaries and follow them, go no contact with her older brother.\n\n\nRemember this OP. Evil triumphs when good men do nothing. \n\nIf you do nothing, you enable your child to be abused. So do something.", "Yeah, your wife should be upset for her daughter.

It never did. This grandma only loved me when I was on the outs with my mom. This grandma also clearly had some weird emotional incest issues towards most of the men in her family, given that when she was widowed, she kept talking about how she couldn\u2019t wait for her brother\u2019s wife to die so that they could finally move to the desert together.", "Your problem is your wife, not Kyle.", "What is Kyle jealous of?
