One of them I have a good relationship with and the other one, let's call him [M38] Kyle, is a real pain in the ass. When I first started dating my wife, I thought he was just an overprotective brother, but then it went too far.\n\nKyle is very fond of my wife, I mean his sister. I don't mean anything bad, their love is brother and sister love and nothing weird, but he loves her way too much. He's addicted to her, he idolizes her. And he could never forgive me for \"stealing\" his sister. Kyle even has his own wife and life, but he continues to hate me and thinks there are guys in the world more deserving of his sister than me. \n\nHe tells me all of this right to my face. He can't stand me so much that he treats my kid worse than his brother's kids. He gives gifts to his brother's kids but not mine. One time my daughter was visiting him with my other brother-in-law's sons and she came back upset. I asked what was wrong and she said that Uncle Kyle gave the boys ice cream for dessert, but not her. I would love to cut off my daughter's interaction with her Uncle Kyle, but my wife insists that he is her relative and he is \"just jealous\". \n\nI can't write what happened last month or I'll get blocked, but I will say that in December, there was another altercation between Kyle and I that resulted in my broken laptop. \n\nAfter that, I decided that I would cut off all relations with Kyle. His wife had a baby a couple days ago. \n\nMy wife asked me what I would give his baby at the party Kyle was throwing. I told her I wasn't giving anything to Kyle or his baby. I said I wasn't coming to Kyle's party at all. My wife insisted that I had to show up to the party and give a gift. \n\nI said I wouldn't do it for two reasons. First, Kyle never gives gifts to my daughter. Second, Kyle broke my laptop and even if I wanted to give the stupid gift, I wouldn't have enough money because I have to buy a new laptop. \n\nMy wife doesn't understand this and keeps saying that Kyle just has a hard temper, that he's just jealous, that I should treat him with understanding. \n\nAm I really an asshole?", "created_utc": 1704304347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xp8ox/aita_for_not_giving_a_gift_to_my_brotherinlaws/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is putting her brother above, not only you but your young child and turning a blind eye to her own daughters bullying by a bloody ADULT!!!!! \n\n\nYour wife is failing her own child for the jealousy of her brother. You need to sit her down and set some serious boundaries. If she disagrees, then you both need marriage counselling, and you need to fight for your daughter to be protected from the overgrown bully. \n\n\nIf something doesn't change soon, your daughter will never forgive her mother or you. She is already telling you she can see and feel the rejection and favouritism. Those are not feelings a child should feel, and if you continue to expose her to this vile behaviour it will affect her long after her childhood, you just need to check some of the posts on here to verify that.", "What sort of mother allows someone to treat their child like crap even worse her brother. Your wife is sick in the head yall should get that checked out.", "Absolutely not the AH here!  Your wife certainly is for not defending her child that is being left out!  How does she answer about her child being discriminated against because of her brother not accepting your kid?  Ask her that, why don\u2019t you?  This is a hill to die on.", "I'm confused, why is your wife asking you? It's her family. Does she not have access to money? That she can't just buy a baby gift that's on probably a registry somewhere ?\n\nI don't even mean it in the way, well she's a woman so she has to buy a baby gift. I mean it in, it's her family, why is he even involved with gift giving?", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to get her head out of the sand and start standing up for you.\n\nI also think it's a little strange you would be sending an individual gift instead of a family gift to begin with.", "In this situation, standing your ground and prioritizing your feelings and your child's well-being seems reasonable. So, I'd say you're definitely NTA. Family dynamics can be complex, and it's essential to set boundaries that protect your peace and the peace of your loved ones.", "NTA \u2014 And this is not brother-sister love! You say he loves your wife too much, but your wife loves him too much! She is putting him above everybody! This ain\u2019t normal! I I don\u2019t care what you think about me but I draw the line when you mistreat my child! Honestly your wife is a terrible mother\u2026 Even if she is getting everything else right!

What, he's got a bad temper & he's jealous, and he treats you and your little daughter badly to your face? Not giving icecream to one child in a group because you are not good enough for his sister? He's a total arsehole, and you absolutely do not have to appease him. Furthermore, while wife can see her awful brother, your daughter should be protected from him. I would be very wary of any event where he will be present, he is abusive, and violent.", "NTA at the first point of him mistreating your daughter it would be a hard no for me.", "First off I question your wife as a mother and as a wife. It\u2019s sounds like she is just as in love with her bro as he is with her. Bro sister relationship maybe. Even if it\u2019s just that and not gross what kind of a mother lets their siblings treat their children AND husband that way. My brother would be layed out if he did the things Kyle did. Your wife needs her head examined. And I would never show to any functions that Kyle is at. Nor subject your kids to it either. NTA", "You weren\u2019t the asshole, but your wife certainly is. She is allowing people to mistreat her own child that is really pathetic.", "NTA but your wife sure is (and a shit mother).", "NTA. This is something that's going to be impossible to avoid now. When you marry, your wife or your husband should be placed above everybody else: including respective mothers and siblings and what not.\n\nThe reason for that is that wife and husband will have a family. And you cannot prioritize your family if you cannot prioritize your SO. This is a classic example. Your wife does not want to chose between you and her brother. Her brother is not only mean to you, her husband, but also takes his grievances out on YOUR child. So by not prioritizing you she now neglecting the care of her child.\n\nThis issue will keep coming up because, fundamentally, your wife does not understand what marriage is about. The family you create should supersede the family that you originate from.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to give that child anything. You don\u2019t need to dance around his shitty behaviour. \n\nHe and his \u201chard temper\u201d can start learning a lesson how his actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's enabling has to get under control. ffs he is openly mistreating HER DAUGHER and it's ok cuz he is \"jealous\" of you??", "NTA and you need to get your daughter away from this toxic person no mater what.\n\nIf your wife won\u2019t protect your daughter you need too. Start documenting everything. From the emotional abuse to the physical abuse.\n\nIf need be leave your wife and file for emergency custody. If she let s her brother treat her daughter this way then she is as much a danger to her as uncle Kyle is!", "Immediate Ick about your wife's reactions/attitude. It's also very unhealthy that two grown adults have such an \"intense\" bonding, which negatively impacts spouses and kids. I'm sorry to be making assumptions but this is some wierd incest fiction level stuff. Ew.", "NTA. Your issues are with your wife, not your BIL. How dare she allow her brother to treat you and your daughter/her baby like that. I think it's time you set serious boundaries with her, for your sake as well as for your child. \n\nThis is not about a gift or a party. If your bil is so enamoured with his sister, she should have been able to set him straight the first time he disrespected you, and absolutely should have cut contact the first moment he disrespected her child.\n\nDo not allow your child to suffer from your wife's nonesense/unresolved issues with her brother.

You are absolutely not an AH, but you need to make changes to have a healthier family and life", "Wake up dude.  Your BIL treats your child with disrespect and is hurtful, he's damaged or destroyed your property and YOUR WIFE, makes excuses for him.  Where is her understanding and compassion for you, or your daughter?  Sounds to me like her loyalty lies with her brother and not your family.  I'd think long an hard before I let my daughter back around this jackass, and I would think equally as hard about your relationship with your wife who doesn't support you or try to protect your daughter.", "NTA but I am concerned about your wife, you is prepared to allow her daughter to be around a family member who openly bullies and taunts her. You need to step up and protect your kids from abusive treatment.", "Nta.  What's wrong with your wife?  Is there more going on here?  Any mom should be pissed off her brother didn't buy her kid ice cream but did buy it for her cousins.  That's not ok behavior.  Is she a mom or a baby?", "NTA.  You have a wife problem,  She likes the attention from her brother way to much and the fact that she allows to treat your daughter like trash is grounds to kick her out.   You don't even have to say what he did last month,  your wife did nothing and still does nothing.  Get rid of the wife,  she's clearly trash.", "NTA but why are you complaining about BIL when your own wife and mother of your children don't care about your children like her brother?!?\n\nIf mommy dearest don't care, you have a wife problem", ">He can't stand me so much that **he treats my kid worse** than his brother's kids.

They're your wife.", "Info: that is also her daughter that he is treating like sh*t right?", "NTA. KYLE IS TA and so is your wife for allowing your kids around someone who treats them that way.", "NTA - its kind of more concerning that your wife is not supporting you", "NTA Kyles gonna Kyle.", "NTA, but your wife sure is! How TF is she okay with your daughter being treated poorly?", "What kind of mother stands by and not only lets her child be mistreated but comes up with excuses as to why an ADULT is jealous and has a temper with a CHILD because he has a weird obsession with his own adult sister??? At this point your wife is participating in your daughter\u2019s mistreatment. \n\n\nDid she not get the memo that her husband and child should come above all else and above any other family members? \n\n\nYou have a wife problem, because if she wanted to she could check her brother but she doesn\u2019t so he is free to do as he pleases to you and your daughter. \n\nI would start making a log of everything your BIL does and your wife\u2019s response because it will be very useful to take to court if you ever end up there for a divorce and you will need to take full custody to ensure your daughter isn\u2019t around that psycho. \n\nNTA but you will be entering A H territory if you allow your daughter to continue to be around her uncle and be mistreated.", "Have you asked your wife why her brother deserves better treatment than your daughter?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
