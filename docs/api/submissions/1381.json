One of the guys in my studio, Jared, decided that the day before the showcase, he wasn\u2019t going to show up to perform. He was unprepared, nervous, and upset. I tried taking the gentle approach because I truly care for him and I asked him if everything was okay. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it so I let it go. We talked on the phone later yesterday afternoon and I asked him if it would be better if we talked to our professor and compromised to where he would only sing the group numbers and skip his solo. He said no that he wasn\u2019t going to show up at all and hung up on me. This morning I saw him and just looked at him and he went off on me. I asked him if he would just come to support his colleagues and he went off on me again. I was done with the bs so I looked at him and told him that he was immature and disrespectful to his studio by doing this. We did everything we could to try to help him. We even put a female voice on tenor so he wasn\u2019t alone. She learned it in a week for him. Then he attacked me for not showing up to class and was saying that it was the same thing as not showing up to a performance. I walked out after that because I was about to cry due to being so upset.

Also, I call bs on him saying not showing up to class as being the same as not showing up for a performance. It is absolutely not the same; not showing up for a performance is worse and effects people who are counting on you. Class, not so much (unless it\u2019s a final rehearsal or something).
