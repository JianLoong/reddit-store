And in those five years, they\u2019ve been trying to have a child, but every attempt was unsuccessful. \n\nMy SIL is adamant about having her own child, but my brother works a minimum-wage job, and my SIL is a stay-at-home wife. They struggle to pay rent, and my parents have to chip in occasionally. It\u2019s frustrating because SIL is always taking advantage of my parents. \n\nMy parents created a fund for my brother and me when we were young for college and weddings. My brother refused to go to college and blew up his money on partying, and had an extravagant wedding. It was over the top, tbh, and now they\u2019re broke. My parents live off their pension money, and I\u2019m studying abroad (in Europe). I\u2019m from an Asia country. \n\nI\u2019m doing my final year degree and plan to continue with my postgraduate degree. I have enough money from my funds, and I\u2019m working part-time to have extra income. I also have money for my wedding. But, I plan to use it to buy a house and invest it instead.\n\nMy SIL brought up the idea of IVF to my parents and asked for money to support the procedure. My parents admitted they did not have that much money and apologised. she tried gaslighting them, and they paid for the first round after selling my mum\u2019s jewelry. Well, that was unsuccessful, and now she\u2019s demanding more.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was on a video call with my family, and my brother and SIL joined. I told my parents my plan and they were happy. \n\nSIL was quiet the whole time and messaged me a few days later, asking how I would support myself financially. thinking she genuinely meant well, I told her I had savings. She then brought up her IVF treatment and asked me to pay for it because my degree should be enough and a master's is useless. she also said buying a house is not worth it when you\u2019re young.\n\nI told her to stop taking advantage of my family and not try to scam a 21 yr old. she was offended and told me to put family first because her having a daughter would be more suitable for the family than me buying a house or continuing my studies. I brought up her financial status and told her to stop trying for a child when she's broke and has to beg people, especially a 21 yr old and older people, for money.\n\nWell, shit hit the fan cause her side of the family is calling me a spoilt brat, and my brother wants me to apologise to his wife. My parents, who were afraid to voice out, are glad I did but think I could\u2019ve done it differently.

You and your wife are young and healthy, you are perfectly capable of supporting yourselves. She needs to get a full-time job. And you need to get a better one so you can support yourselves, and your future children. You can't expect us to do it for you. Or your sister.\"", "Your brother needs to renegotiate. She works again until they can afford more IVF, and then she can stop working if she gets pregnant. If the pregnancy is that important to her, it's the least she can do to make it happen. Especially before asking for handouts.\n\nYou're NTA, because you're right. Kids are expensive and a big important responsibility, and they both sound irresponsible af. Infertility is emotionally difficult so I'm sure she's not enjoying the situation, but it doesn't mean they need to keep being entitled AHs. It's definitely not up to you or your parents to keep financing them. (Is she scamming her side too, or are they calling you a brat in hopes you'll pay so they are off the hook?). And her doing IVF isn't more important than your life and your own stability, sheesh.", "And your parents just keep giving them money every time they ask? They should both be working. \n\nTell her to get a cat, it'll sleep in with her, unlike a baby...", "You better make sure the rest of your money is locked down tight. SIL is absolutely going to try to guilt your parents into giving it to her.", "No, they cannot see their MALE children suffer. I doubt you would receive the treatment if you were in trouble", "Cats deserve better than her", "Well, I do sometimes have to get up in the very early hours  and feed my cat and go back to bed.  But he just repeatedly bats me in the face; he doesn't cry or need a diaper change.", "That is absolutely true.", "Yeah... mine do that too. I wake up to one of them patting me on the cheek. The other one just bashes the door, yelling until I get up and serve him.", "Nta. Tell her and your brother to lose your number. They'll only use it to try and shame you or beg for money.", "NTA. If her family is so upset, then they should be supporting her and your brother and paying for IVF, instead of demanding you and your family do it. Keep protecting your parents and encouraging them to preserve their retirement. Your brother and SIL aren't going to take care of them, which would leave it on you, and you know your brother and SIL would continue to demand you help them too.", "NTA.  They can't even support themselves (based on the fact that your parents chip in periodically).  I wouldn't apologize.  You told her the truth.  Your brother should apologize to his wife.  He's the one who blew his college fund on frivolous things.", "What you did was entirely correct. Do not back down. Block her if you have to. She sounds like a nightmare. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I mean to be rude when I say her type of genetics do not need to carry on because once that baby is born your parents and you by proxy will be on the hook for a lot more and I mean this from personal experience \ud83d\ude1e. You are doing amazing and you keep being an amazing 21 year old and strive for your goals.", "NTA. \nIf  she wanted it that bad maybe she would work for her own money. Seems like your family just enabled her applied behavior, if it hit the fan you will see how their standards will change. Your completely right and will probably be very successful by 30.", "NTA - your parents need to learn to stand up for themselves and cut your lazy brother off. Also SIL needs to get a freaking job. \n\nMake sure your money can't be touched by ANYONE but you. I wouldn't be surprised if someone tried to steal your money somehow.", "NTA! Tell the side of her family to all of them chip in for the IVF if it is so important to all of them for her to have a child. Also talk about spoil when she doesn\u2019t even work when she perfectly could??? Why not work and sabe for the IVF? Why do peopl have to pay for her to have a baby? DONT APOLOGIZE! And tell your parents to stop giving money.", "NTA at all", "NTA. You do not owe her any money, and YOU DO NOT OWE HER AN APOLOGY!!!!", "That\u2019s a crazy situation,. My heart goes out to you for that. I understand what\u2019s your coming and feel frustrated on how your brothers wife could be so horrible. \ud83e\udd79", "Nta. If her family cares that much they can pay. She sounds ridiculous", ">She then brought up her IVF treatment and asked me to pay for it because my degree should be enough and a master's is useless. she also said buying a house is not worth it when you\u2019re young.\n\n>I told her to stop taking advantage of my family and not try to scam a 21 yr old.\n\nGood response!!! She is trying to scam you! NTA. \n\n>Well, shit hit the fan cause her side of the family is calling me a spoilt brat, and my brother wants me to apologise to his wife.\n\nBecause you.... refused to hand your entire future over to your brother on an off chance they might have a kid you will be expected to pay for? Your brother also had the chances you had but blew it all on partying and a wedding to her. Not sure why you are even hearing from her family.", "Oh I have a friend who got pregnant 2 months before her wedding, and her husband already had a son from a previous relationship. She didn\u2019t work and he was a general contractor. They got married and struggled financially for a long time. They have since had another child and have been living with her parents. Her husband now has a steady job and they are looking for a new rental (they can\u2019t afford to buy and don\u2019t have good credit) and she still stays at home. I completely agree though that you should not have a kid if you aren\u2019t financially responsible.", "NTA. I\u2019m Asian also and what kind of saintly MIL is your mother?!", "NTA. There was nothing wrong with the way you said it. The simple fact that she felt it her right to tell you how to use your money says it all. Just how do they plan to pay for a child if she ever gets pregnant? Not with one person working a minimum wage job. I don't understand why the fertility clinic would even treat her with IVF if they knew she couldn't afford to care for one child, let alone two or more. Seems like that should be part of the process for IVF treatment, just like for adoption. You can tell her that you are putting your family first. You are putting your parents first by telling your brother and SIL to quit asking for their money and possessions. You are putting the family you may have one day first by using your money to build a better life in advance, not that it is any of her business. They would have had a better life if your brother had gone to school instead of wasting his money on partying and if they spent less on the extravagant wedding. That use of money was his choice, he didn't give any to you. Why should you give any to him? How you handle your money is your choice and they will not get any of it.", "NTA. If they can\u2019t even pay their rent all the time, brother only has a minimum wage job, and SIL is unwilling to work, they are in no position to be parents right now, so should not be trying to be!", "NTA. What the heck does a stay at home wife do???? If they had kids then she would have a job. Cleaning the house and cooking is not a full time job. She needs to at least get a part time job then spend the rest of her time maintaining the home. This is ridiculous to just stay home while you are able to work leaving your husband to barely pay the rent!!", "NTA\nOne reason I tell people why I don't want kids, us because I'm poor as hell. I always get the \"well there's welfare\" like...no", "You are totally NTA. Your ability to see through manipulation and your ability to set boundaries with your family is brilliant. Your brother needs to face financial reality and leave your parents alone.", "I wanted to throw my phone when I got to the part about your parents selling jewelry to fund the first round of ivf. Good on you for standing up to her crap.", "Dunno how much of it is cultural but you're 1000% in the right on this one from start to finish.  Your parents SOLD JEWELRY to support this and can't see the issue....\n\nNTA", "I don't understand why she is a stay at home wife when their money situation is so bad? If she got a job maybe they could save and afford the IVF themselves. \n\nNever and I mean NEVER help someone financially who refuses to help themselves! NTA", "NTA - she can get a job to pay for IVF.", " It is irresponsible for a couple to actively pursue having a child when they have to borrow money on a semi-regular basis just to cover rent. NTA for being a voice of reason.", "NTA, your SIL sounds like a spoiled brat who's never had to work for anything and never been told no before.\n\nIf you can't feed, clothe, house, and pay for a child's medical expenses it's selfish to try for a baby.", "NTA, she needs to get a job.", "Ooof! Definitely NTA. She needs a reality check, and frankly I think your family does too. She needs to be cut off.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get a job & stop demanding money from others.", "You\u2019re a Gold! Hahaha well done kid!", "The real big question is: how can she be a stay at home mom if she has no kids?", "Yeah it\u2019ll be \u201cyou have to support my miracle child\u201d and \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you doing more for your nibling? They are a miracle\u2026 you need to help.\u201d", "Honestly if she isn\u2019t willing to work for ivf, how badly could she actually want it?", "But SIL can tel OP what to do with her money because she is \u201cpoor\u201d and OP \u201chas money\u201d?? Are you the SIL?????", "They want to pursue IVF- that\u2019s shit expensive. They are not just having a child they want to do IVF and can\u2019t pay for it. I do not think OP is biased at all and I think you haven\u2019t read it.", "She'll be back\n\nFor more cash", "and ever (ever)", "Stay at home spouse must be one of the most pointless occupations in existence... unless there's a disability at play, the fact that a grown ass woman is at home all day by herself, with no job, no studies, not even volunteer work just to do *something* is mind blowing.", "She didn't handle a part-time job and she thinks she can handle a baby? That's priceless", "If anything more is said by SIL, definitely bring up that she is more than welcome to fund her own IVF by working & paying herself. Op, How did you get the savings? Was it by working? All the more ammunition to point out that SIL should work her own way.", "Tell her to get a job taking care of kids and see if she is still gung-ho about having her own.", "I have a baby and she's gonna have a hell of a time when her newborn is waking up every 3 hours to feed. I love my son and am so happy I have him but those first few months were incredibly hard because of how tired I was and how urgent the needs of a baby are. NTA.", "It makes me so sad that your mother sold her jewelry for failed IVF. Your SIL is despicable.", "I might sound super crazy here but, no one in your family is expecting her to get a job? OK, she wants to be a stay at home mom, but there is no kids now. And if they let you study abroad, they don't sound like the type of parents that belittle women. \nAnd what about her side of the family? Can't they help? They seemed concerned about her getting pregnant...", "And congrats on your accomplishments at 21 years old. That's pretty suitable for any family. You seem to know where you're going with your life, managed to have savings, are independent and you still keep an eye on your elders. You go girl!", "I would love to be a stay at home wife, but I'm introverted af. I'd like to just mill around the house, cook, paint, embroider, etc. I'd keep a nice garden too and be by myself for most of the day.", "Dunno if I totally agree with that. I'm a lady and a feminist, but I think there's plenty to do in terms of taking care of the house/admin/upkeep for two people. (It's not a whole life; as you say, she should have some interests or engagements of her own. And since she and hubby aren't self-sustaining, she should have a job.) But \"homemaking\" is *almost* a full time job. My boyfriend and I both work full time, which for both of us is more than 40 hours a week, plus commute, plus work stuff we have to take home, plus frequent travel for him. We just honestly don't have time/energy to complete all the gross adult responsibilities (cooking, cleaning, shopping, bills, appointments, etc.) *and* enjoy leisure time (in any meaningful and enriching way.)\n\nIt would be healthier if the norm was that two people's part-time labor could sustain a household, leaving plenty of time and energy to have a work-life balance. Dunno if I'm just feeling extra burnt out these days, but I'd love a stay at home spouse for my boyfriend and me.", "Depends on the reason. A lot of military wives are stay at home because it is hard to impossible to find a career type job around the base. They don\u2019t want to hire a military spouse because they expect you to move every x years. So don\u2019t want to hire someone who will just move away. \n\nThis is one reason you see MLMs so prevalent on military bases. They prey on people who can\u2019t get a regular job and might have some disposable income.", "It is going to be a perfect baby and let her sleep or hubby or grandparents are going to take care of it.\n\nMy question is how did she pass a psyche test for the IVF?", "HA! My cats are up by 5 AM", "This is a good thought! Even if it doesn't legally qualify as elder abuse just yet, it is definitely going to go there once OP's parents start to need more support as they get older. They are either suffering elder abuse now, or are at very high risk of it in future.", "Totally agree! Especially since OPs parents have already sold jewelry to help her have IVF. Instead of getting a job herself and saving themselves they want to exploit elderly parents!", "Yeah I'm wondering this too because OP probably would've said if SIL wasn't able-bodied so it sounds like she is and just refuses to work.", "I had to go back and check OP\u2019s gender because I thought this exact same thing while reading", "Not this time. As mentioned by the OP the SIL quit her part-time job because \"she didn't like the commitment of having to get up early\" which pretty much says that she'll be just as committed to taking care of a child. Grandma & grandpa will end up taking over care of the child since I doubt that would be willing to allow their inept son & DIL to manage the child. It would be better for everyone involved if the SIL never had a kid.", "That's exactly what I do! I don't leave the house for days!!!! I'm a writer lol", "This is our eventual plan. I'm trying to further my education in a field that will make me money, even part time, so my FH can be at home at least until he gets bored (we both know they will happen fast lol). But still.  He's been in the navy for what will be 21 years when he retires out- and he's so physically broken I honestly think he deserves a serious break from working to loyally just survive for a while. I've got 2.5 years to make this happen, so I'm trying. After he goes back to work (knowing him I think he will be climbing the walls after less than 6mo ) then we will revert back to me working from home (I work remotely rn and am very, very lucky I get to make my own hours) and handling the house and hobbies. We're looking into fields with like a 3mo on 3 mo off kind of thing so we can still LIVE.", "I've lost friends to these stupid things.  Been a military gf for almost 7 years and we get married this week! But you're dead on.  I'm very, very,  VERY lucky I have a gig that will let me work from home and make my own hours but even with all the educative resources for spouses, the moving really screws it up and then everything is constantly on hold for the milspouses- especially if children are involved. \n\nMLMs are vicious, predatory and just overall evil.  Had friends go bankrupt over a MLM ( something like Lu la leggings) and this will dramatically affect the ability to get and maintain a security clearance. Depending on your job, you can get discharged from the military if you file bankruptcy cause now you're a massive risk."]}
