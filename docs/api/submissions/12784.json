And in those five years, they\u2019ve been trying to have a child, but every attempt was unsuccessful. \n\nMy SIL is adamant about having her own child, but my brother works a minimum-wage job, and my SIL is a stay-at-home wife. They struggle to pay rent, and my parents have to chip in occasionally. It\u2019s frustrating because SIL is always taking advantage of my parents. \n\nMy parents created a fund for my brother and me when we were young for college and weddings. My brother refused to go to college and blew up his money on partying, and had an extravagant wedding. It was over the top, tbh, and now they\u2019re broke. My parents live off their pension money, and I\u2019m studying abroad (in Europe). I\u2019m from an Asia country. \n\nI\u2019m doing my final year degree and plan to continue with my postgraduate degree. I have enough money from my funds, and I\u2019m working part-time to have extra income. I also have money for my wedding. But, I plan to use it to buy a house and invest it instead.\n\nMy SIL brought up the idea of IVF to my parents and asked for money to support the procedure. My parents admitted they did not have that much money and apologised. she tried gaslighting them, and they paid for the first round after selling my mum\u2019s jewelry. Well, that was unsuccessful, and now she\u2019s demanding more.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was on a video call with my family, and my brother and SIL joined. I told my parents my plan and they were happy. \n\nSIL was quiet the whole time and messaged me a few days later, asking how I would support myself financially. thinking she genuinely meant well, I told her I had savings. She then brought up her IVF treatment and asked me to pay for it because my degree should be enough and a master's is useless. she also said buying a house is not worth it when you\u2019re young.\n\nI told her to stop taking advantage of my family and not try to scam a 21 yr old. she was offended and told me to put family first because her having a daughter would be more suitable for the family than me buying a house or continuing my studies. I brought up her financial status and told her to stop trying for a child when she's broke and has to beg people, especially a 21 yr old and older people, for money.\n\nWell, shit hit the fan cause her side of the family is calling me a spoilt brat, and my brother wants me to apologise to his wife. My parents, who were afraid to voice out, are glad I did but think I could\u2019ve done it differently.

If she wants one, she should work with her husband to improve their income. If she's still adamant, then it'll just have to be sink or swim. Nobody else is bound to help her for premeditated bad decisions.\n\nIf you ever give them money, it should be a gift: cherished and appreciated as a token of your generosity and love for them.
