And in those five years, they\u2019ve been trying to have a child, but every attempt was unsuccessful. \n\nMy SIL is adamant about having her own child, but my brother works a minimum-wage job, and my SIL is a stay-at-home wife. They struggle to pay rent, and my parents have to chip in occasionally. It\u2019s frustrating because SIL is always taking advantage of my parents. \n\nMy parents created a fund for my brother and me when we were young for college and weddings. My brother refused to go to college and blew up his money on partying, and had an extravagant wedding. It was over the top, tbh, and now they\u2019re broke. My parents live off their pension money, and I\u2019m studying abroad (in Europe). I\u2019m from an Asia country. \n\nI\u2019m doing my final year degree and plan to continue with my postgraduate degree. I have enough money from my funds, and I\u2019m working part-time to have extra income. I also have money for my wedding. But, I plan to use it to buy a house and invest it instead.\n\nMy SIL brought up the idea of IVF to my parents and asked for money to support the procedure. My parents admitted they did not have that much money and apologised. she tried gaslighting them, and they paid for the first round after selling my mum\u2019s jewelry. Well, that was unsuccessful, and now she\u2019s demanding more.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was on a video call with my family, and my brother and SIL joined. I told my parents my plan and they were happy. \n\nSIL was quiet the whole time and messaged me a few days later, asking how I would support myself financially. thinking she genuinely meant well, I told her I had savings. She then brought up her IVF treatment and asked me to pay for it because my degree should be enough and a master's is useless. she also said buying a house is not worth it when you\u2019re young.\n\nI told her to stop taking advantage of my family and not try to scam a 21 yr old. she was offended and told me to put family first because her having a daughter would be more suitable for the family than me buying a house or continuing my studies. I brought up her financial status and told her to stop trying for a child when she's broke and has to beg people, especially a 21 yr old and older people, for money.\n\nWell, shit hit the fan cause her side of the family is calling me a spoilt brat, and my brother wants me to apologise to his wife. My parents, who were afraid to voice out, are glad I did but think I could\u2019ve done it differently.

And he doesn't want you shaming him when he clearly has no shame. \n\n I feel bad for your parents, because they've let him walk all over them. You say they were glad you did what you did, but are they willing to stand up for themselves now, and say, \"Sorry son, but we're not funding your life anymore. You and your wife are young and healthy, you are perfectly capable of supporting yourselves. She needs to get a full-time job. And you need to get a better one so you can support yourselves, and your future children. You can't expect us to do it for you. Or your sister.\"", "Your brother needs to renegotiate. She works again until they can afford more IVF, and then she can stop working if she gets pregnant. If the pregnancy is that important to her, it's the least she can do to make it happen. Especially before asking for handouts.\n\nYou're NTA, because you're right. Kids are expensive and a big important responsibility, and they both sound irresponsible af. Infertility is emotionally difficult so I'm sure she's not enjoying the situation, but it doesn't mean they need to keep being entitled AHs. It's definitely not up to you or your parents to keep financing them. (Is she scamming her side too, or are they calling you a brat in hopes you'll pay so they are off the hook?). And her doing IVF isn't more important than your life and your own stability, sheesh.", "And your parents just keep giving them money every time they ask? They should both be working. \n\nTell her to get a cat, it'll sleep in with her, unlike a baby...", "You better make sure the rest of your money is locked down tight. SIL is absolutely going to try to guilt your parents into giving it to her.", "No, they cannot see their MALE children suffer. I doubt you would receive the treatment if you were in trouble", "Cats deserve better than her", "Well, I do sometimes have to get up in the very early hours  and feed my cat and go back to bed.  But he just repeatedly bats me in the face; he doesn't cry or need a diaper change.", "That is absolutely true.", "Yeah... mine do that too. I wake up to one of them patting me on the cheek. The other one just bashes the door, yelling until I get up and serve him."]}
