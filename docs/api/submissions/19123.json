What \u201chelp\u201d did your mum give him? Need more info.", "ESH I'm particularly disturbed over the fact that your mom disowned her MINOR child over sending pics instead of, oh I don't know, being concerned that her bf is manipulating/soliciting/who knows what. Brother's actions were inappropriate at the funeral, but you all sound terrible.", "Shared DNA is not a life sentence for putting up with awful behavior. NTA.\nCut ties completely...", "Sorry... your mother kicked him out because he sent 'spicy' pics to HER boyfriend? Presumably her boyfriend was an ACTUAL ADULT, and she blamed her CHILD for that...?\n\nWithout info on exactly what it is your brother did leading up to that, it's hard to comment. But from what you've said, ESH. Your mum massively sucks for DISOWNING HER CHILD. Your brother sucks for choosing to use a funeral as a place to make snarky remarks. You suck for saying something cruel to your brother.\n\nI hope your whole family gets therapy.", "ESH I can\u2019t help but feel like something is missing. Kids rarely act like that for no reason unless he has some type of personality disorder, but even that stems at least partly from trauma. I\u2019m not going to discredit what you are saying but siblings often tend to side with parents without having a full understanding of certain situations. I\u2019m not drawing any conclusions as to who is certainly at fault here because I feel like there\u2019s not enough information. That being said, telling someone the day they were disowned was the best day of your life when clearly it\u2019s something they\u2019re still hurt by is a really nasty thing to do. And also him being gay probably means that outside his family, he\u2019s probably had to deal with others making him feel unwanted as well. Also the fact that he says himself he feels you guys are sick of him because he\u2019s gay says A LOT. Regardless of whether the issue was at home or elsewhere clearly your brother has been made to feel very unwanted, and the comment you made probably hit him like a million bricks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA.\n\nThink about why you said what you said.  What was the purpose?

How about showing some respect and keeping the comments to yourself.\u201d\n\nThen, if he turned and made a snide comment to you, you could let him have it with your comment because by aiming for you, it now became more personal and your defending yourself.", "ESH here except maybe the aunt.

That\u2019s a parenting failure. Plus it\u2019s extremely concerning that your mothers response to him sending inappropriate pictures to an adult, as a minor, was to disown him instead of being concerned about there being abuse", "YTA, your comment was unnecessary, petty, cruel and disrespectful to everyone involved, especially given the location and timing. You were supposed to be there to mourn your grandmother, instead you took the opportunity to be rude to your brother and widen the wedge between him and your mother. The feud is between your mother and your brother, not you. Stay out of it and don\u2019t unnecessarily involve yourself.", "YTA. 17 was very early for your mom to give up on your brother. Some kids are still in the middle of puberty and especially being gay actually makes that harder even if your parents were supportive. You didn\u2019t need to get involved and you absolutely didn\u2019t have to just be mean. If you really wanted to protect your mom, you could have told him to back him up. You didn\u2019t. You chose to be mean.", "NTA and I truly wonder why everyone in here is so quick to just assume her brother was some misunderstood saint", "I'm withholding judgment because we don't know the full story. Your Brother was I'm assuming a minor when he sent the pics to the BF, which is a sign of abuse.", "Fixed that, thxs", "Honestly I feel like this is a very surface level take. This is only OPs side of the story. I highly doubt the whole thing with the pics was as simple as he made it sound especially considering his brother was a minor.", "Who said he was soliciting.
