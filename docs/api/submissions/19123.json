Of course I don't know for sure, but I'd damn well be extremely concerned, especially with someone who has a history of acting out.", "I'm not your sister, and if it had been a 17 year old girl sending pics to a grown man and then being disowned, people would be freaking out.", "She sent him to his Aunt's home.", "Parents are responsible for their children, disowning your child before they even reach adulthood shows a screwup somewhere along the way. And we\u2019re gonna totally slide right past the minor sending inappropriate photos? That very well could be a sign of past or current abuse and mom just kicks him out? I see someone who was probably failed by the adults in his life", "Considering the brother was probably extremely hurt by his parents, an empathetic person would at least not be ruder than necessary.", "He was 17. OP also didn't say if the pics were wanted or unwanted? That seems like important info considering the brother could have been groomed by said boyfriend.", "I mean there is always the possibility of the BF encouraging that or blackmailing the guy. Some people are child predators and sometimes those predators are people you'd never expect. It doesn't sound like it is the case here, and some people really are just assholes, but OP may need to consider if there's more to this story than he (and the mother) knows about.", "Was the boyfriend innocent in this? Did he encourage the underage son to send those pictures? We really don't have all the information here.", "My father kicked me out at 16 because I was pregnant. It happens more than you think. Some parents suck.", "The fact that you jump straight into a major homophobic dog whistle like \"another gay guy wanting to subvert straight guys\" is really telling to me here.", "Thank you, I glossed over the typo in the quote \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab now I get it! Lol", "The key is how mom found out, did boyfriend tell the mom the first time it happened and was like \"WTF, something is wrong with your kid\" or did she find out another way.", "It's concerning yes but we also need to keep in mind that we don't know his bahaviour history.\nSo I think it's unfair to judge the moms \"immediate reaction\" , because this might not of been immediate. It might of been a long time coming, but that last thing pushed her to breaking point.\n\nHer reaction might be completely justified because of previous incidents. Everyone has a breaking point and limits on how much they can take.\n\nTo be fair the mom did try to take him to somewhere he'd be looked after, she could have kicked him out into the streets.", "Nope the same thing. Enticing men sexually is not appropriate, girlfriend. Just deserved.", "Sister is the same as sis, or dude, anyways not the point, point is he wasn't disowned just because he sent adult pics, seems like it was the last straw, we don't know the whole history of his bad behavior imo.", "It's not typical teenage behavior if he was constantly in trouble and getting suspended from school all the time.", "It was bad enough he got suspended multiple times. OP said his mom tried but I'm guess professional help was needed even before the picture incident.", "Or the kid is just a kid who chooses to act this way. Not everything is because of abuse. There are some people who enjoy getting people upset and love to watch chaos spread out around them, it makes them happy.", "A smart person would cut off and refuse to see anyone who did that to them instead of keeping a toxic relationship going. He should have cut off his family ages ago.", "What fresh hell is this?", "There definitely could be more to the story, but to me the crux of the AITA event is no matter what your grievances are, a room with a coffin in it usually isn't the place to grind your axe.", "Whay part about no context. Even if it was asked for... still not differnt.", "And what kind of minor sends pics like those to adults? Not well adjusted kids, that's for sure. Do we know why he sent those pics? Was he being coerced or groomed into sending them? Was the boyfriend innocent here or was he manipulating a minor desperate for affection? This doesn't sound like the full story to me.\n\nObviously I can't be certain, but something tells me this kid didn't get the kind of support he deserved. For one, kicking him out while he's a minor is child abandonment and is illegal.", "I'm sorry that's awful my sister and cousins did some pretty shitty things as teens but they weren't kicked out.I can't imagine kicking kids out", "I am not surprised and I completely agree, but I am talking about specifically a gay teenage boy and a straight adult man in his life, presumably being friendly with him in a non-sexual manner.", "Son sends mum\u2019s boyfriend nudes - boyfriend tells mum - mum tells son to stop - son continues. \n\nThat is how I see it playing out.", "It's normal to have a number of your parent partner. Would be odd not to have. What if you can't reach a parent? \nI have number on my partner's son and call him sunshine. Below zero sexual interest between us. It's called family.", "The OP started their post about how awful the brother's behavior was and how he was suspended from school all the time.", "I do not appreciate you calling my \"sister\" and \"girlfriend\". Stop.", "Clearly I know that sister is not literally. I can still not appreciate it.", "Plus we don't know how the mom found out, if the bf was the one who immediately told her then it's not on the bf. Idk a lot of missing info here imo.", " Being suspended is not reasonable. To disown your cuild", "A minor engaging in any kind of sexual behavior with an adult, including sending photos, should he grounds for immediate investigation for abuse. He was a literal child with a brain still a decade away from being fully developed. Abandoning your kid instead of doing everything to help them will always make someone an AH. He wasn\u2019t 25, he was only 17. Now he\u2019s definitely going to have issues for life because of how his shitty mom treated him. You don\u2019t get to just give up being a parent because it\u2019s hard. I\u2019m baffled that she didn\u2019t investigate her boyfriend, he very well could\u2019ve been telling the 17-year-old to send him photos. That\u2019s extremely common", "Good for you that you always have a perfect solution and never feel ambiguous at all", "If he was groomed and manipulated into sending those pics, that absolutely changes the context. That's my concern, here.", "..or did he send those pics to his moms boyfriend to get him.in trouble with the law?", "She sent him to live with an Aunt to live until he was 18, then the Aunt kicked him out. At 18 he's an adult. Sometimes kids are just out of control. You can try therapy, counseling, being supportive whatever you want and some kids just don't respond.", "It seems pretty clear from OP's description that he wasn't a well adjusted kid.  And I know that everyone loves to blame the parents but there is such a thing as crappy kids with good parents.   She didn't just kick him out, she sent him to his aunt's, which is completely legal and not child abandonment.", "He was 17.

My dad should never have been a parent.", "Yes, but that\u2019s how you see it being played out. That is not reality. You, or I, or both could be completely wrong about the situation; but we won\u2019t know until more info is given. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple tbh, because this could very well be a thing that the bf was in on, and used it to his advantage when caught. But we don\u2019t know, so it reallyyyy depends on how these nudes were found.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m viewing this in my legal Beagle mind, so I\u2019m going by what the literal text says and what could be deduced from it. Crazy that being rational and neutral until given all evidence is downvote worthy.", "The passwords of past you have successfully guessed, **but now it's time for the robot test!**", "The OP gave no examples beyond he got suspended.

If he was that bad, I'll just take their word, especially since we're not them and all have our own experiences that lead to us having certain thresholds and limits.

It adds blame to the boyfriend but 17 is older enough to not send pics to your parents partner.", "These types of threads and can't handle that some people are just born losers. I've met many of them in life, wonderful family, great siblings and fun to be around. They just love drama to the point they start shit for zero reason.\n\nSeems the brother is one of those types that can't handle being still. Something always needs to pop off.\n\nAnd yes, these types are the types that will flirt or send highly illegal shit to adults. Happened to my friend's sister with him. He had to just say she couldn't be over if their parents weren't around anymore because he couldn't trust her.\n\nThankfully these were in the days of TMobile sidekicks and flip phones so myspace and Facebook was the only thing she could stalk", "OPs description has very little detail. What did he do to get suspended? What part of the world/country is this, because there are still places in the US that would find a reason to suspend an openly gay kid just to get him out of their school.\n\nWhat kind of help did the mom try to give this kid? Did she send him to a therapist or an ultra conservative pastor? Was the kid supported and accepted when he came out? Or was the \"help\" offered to try to straighten him out? \n\nHow were the photos discovered? Did she happen to find them after they had been sending them for ages? Was the boyfriend innocent or complicit in these exchanges? Or did the boyfriend immediately show them to her the first time it happened?\n\nVery little about this \"seems pretty clear\" to me. A lot of important info has been left out. Unfortunately, when it comes to LGBTQIA+ youth, these questions are very important because the type of \"help\" offered isn't always helpful or affirming.", "I agree everyone acting like the mom is such a great mom.", "You're assuming based on nothing", "Seems like an important detail to leave out if she did. Just says she kicked the kid out after she found out", "So every 17 year old who slept with their high school teacher is equally at fault?", "Because the mom literally did nothing wrong.", "How am I assuming when I literally said we won\u2019t know until there\u2019s more info lmao", "Your putting words into my mouth. Extent of blame doesn't matter. They are to blame for their own actions. Why the fuck are we going to the Matt to defend a 17 year old sending pictures to their parents partner. Even if they were fucking seduced, they made that choice.", "She abandoned her son at 17", "\"Even if they were manipulated and groomed\"\n\nFTFY"]}
