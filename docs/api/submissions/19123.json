Presumably her boyfriend was an ACTUAL ADULT, and she blamed her CHILD for that...?\n\nWithout info on exactly what it is your brother did leading up to that, it's hard to comment.

I\u2019m not drawing any conclusions as to who is certainly at fault here because I feel like there\u2019s not enough information. That being said, telling someone the day they were disowned was the best day of your life when clearly it\u2019s something they\u2019re still hurt by is a really nasty thing to do. And also him being gay probably means that outside his family, he\u2019s probably had to deal with others making him feel unwanted as well. Also the fact that he says himself he feels you guys are sick of him because he\u2019s gay says A LOT. Regardless of whether the issue was at home or elsewhere clearly your brother has been made to feel very unwanted, and the comment you made probably hit him like a million bricks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s a parenting failure. Plus it\u2019s extremely concerning that your mothers response to him sending inappropriate pictures to an adult, as a minor, was to disown him instead of being concerned about there being abuse", "YTA, your comment was unnecessary, petty, cruel and disrespectful to everyone involved, especially given the location and timing. You were supposed to be there to mourn your grandmother, instead you took the opportunity to be rude to your brother and widen the wedge between him and your mother. The feud is between your mother and your brother, not you. Stay out of it and don\u2019t unnecessarily involve yourself.", "YTA. 17 was very early for your mom to give up on your brother. Some kids are still in the middle of puberty and especially being gay actually makes that harder even if your parents were supportive. You didn\u2019t need to get involved and you absolutely didn\u2019t have to just be mean. If you really wanted to protect your mom, you could have told him to back him up. You didn\u2019t. You chose to be mean.", "NTA and I truly wonder why everyone in here is so quick to just assume her brother was some misunderstood saint", "I'm withholding judgment because we don't know the full story. Your Brother was I'm assuming a minor when he sent the pics to the BF, which is a sign of abuse.", "Fixed that, thxs", "Honestly I feel like this is a very surface level take. This is only OPs side of the story. I highly doubt the whole thing with the pics was as simple as he made it sound especially considering his brother was a minor.", "Who said he was soliciting.

Yes, 17-year-olds are still kids, but acting as if it's unheard of for teens to be morons about sending inappropriate pictures is a bit naive.", "NTA, I'm in the exact same situation.  My brother is gay, and we kind of knew all through the 80's when he was in high school.  He graduated, got married, and started a family.  He started cheating on his wife with guys from work pretty early on and within two years they were divorced and he was out.  We didn't love the way he treated his ex-wife, but we didn't care that he was gay.  His behavior towards all of use just got nastier and nastier and we finally told him we wanted nothing to do with him and he screamed \"YOU'RE ALL HOMOPHOBES!\"\n\nNope, you're just an asshole, big difference.  We ended up keeping his ex-wife as a bona fide family member.  We see her and my niece constantly.

Sounds like the family has a litany of issues, not just the brother.", "If the boyfriend was up front and honest as soon as he received the pics, then I'd believe that they were unsolicited and unwanted.
