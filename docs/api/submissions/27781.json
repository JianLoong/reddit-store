{"id": 27781, "submission_id": "16u5152", "title": "AITA for not asking my fianc\u00e9 for permission to go to a concert?", "selftext": "I (24F) have been with my fianc\u00e9 (25M) for a bit over two years now. Now I am usually the type of girlfriend to stay home on a Friday night, and can say that my life is rather boring, which to me is bliss, since I like it that way. My fianc\u00e9 and I have a mutual friend group, and today, one of our friends (25M), asked me if I wanted to go to a Faye Webster concert. I said yes, since I\u2019ve never been to a concert and immediately was excited. This friend, for the purpose of the story I will call him K, is the newest addition to our friend group. We met him in our last year of college. I was his first friend, since he had huge troubles adapting, since he moved to the states. At first, it was just me, but then my fianc\u00e9 and best friend started hanging out with him too, so he is not an unfamiliar figure. He got the tickets as a deal, and had one remaining, so he asked me, since in this friend group he is closest to me. \nExcited, I told my fianc\u00e9 these news on our evening walk. Immediately, he started fuming and told me that I am not allowed to go, since I didn\u2019t ask him for permission first. I was bummed out, since to me these news were exciting, and me being \u2018not allowed\u2019 was a slap in the face. Suddenly it felt like I was a little kid again, being punished by my parents. \nHere\u2019s where I think I might be the asshole: maybe I should have brought it up as a question first, rather then just telling him. I feel bad for making him so upset, but I am still at a loss here.\nYes, I am engaged, but not imprisoned, and it was the first time I ever asked to go somewhere like that without him.\nEvery time we have a conversation since then, it just ends up being the continuation of a fight. \nI just feel like as an adult I need to have the freedom to be able to go somewhere without him. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1695871230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u5152/aita_for_not_asking_my_fianc\u00e9_for_permission_to/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're 'not allowed to go'? I'd go and be happy the whole time. You don't need to ask him to do anything. Go to the concert and have a night out to reevaluate your relationship. His behavior is irrational and frighteningly possessive. You're right, he's not your parents. You don't have to listen to him in terms of rules and regulations. \n\nFrankly, I'd go and tell him to go screw himself and do it with a smile. I'd also break up with him. This would be the biggest, brightest red flag shown to me. His behavior is reprehensible and he should be happy you're having a fun time out with friends. Not consistently belittling you and picking a fight over you wanting to have fun. Without him. Hell no.", "Yikes. Red flags flapping in the wind. You need to get away from this controlling guy so you can live your life. NTA.", "NTA\n\nDon't marry this guy! Consider it an early warning. Controlling behavior is likely to get worse.", "NTA at all... why in the world would you need his \"permission\"? And why did he forbid you?\n\n**Huge red flag here... worthy of reconsidering the relationship...**", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re your own person and you control what you do. Your fianc\u00e9e is supposed to add to your life, not take things away (like your autonomy). \n\nKeep an eye on him doing things like this, I feel like it could spiral and land you in a bad spot.", "NTA - you're an adult and can do whatever the hell you want. You don't need his \"permission\" to enjoy a show with your friends. That's a huge red flag for controlling behavior, and another for the jealousy he's exhibiting, and another for projecting the insecurity on you.", "NTA. Holy mother of red flags!! It's a concert and he's asking you to go as a friend as he had an extra ticket that would otherwise go to waste. It'd be one thing if your fiance said 'hey, we don't know this guy all that well (like if he'd just joined your friends group the day before and had offered the ticket). I feel uncomfortable with you going with him because of that' sort of thing. The fact that your fiance's first reaction is to lose their temper...run away fast. Not good.", "NTA - you do not need anyone\u2019s permission ! Anyone asserting that level of control is out of line. It\u2019s one thing for him to be a little put off for not being included but there is NEVER anything to do with asking PERMISSION ! That is crossing some big lines and is a major red flag !!  \n\nTake some time to consider this relationship dynamic carefully. I\u2019d sit down and ask him what makes him thing you need permission of that he has any authority over you to grant or deny permission. You are not a child and he is not your parent. This is very concerning!!!l\n\nI would suggest couples counseling to level set but also start being more aware of this pattern of behavior. Even married you don\u2019t need permission !  Being considerate of each others feelings is one things being chastised and forbidden is something else entirely. I\u2019d suggest carefully reevaluating this relationship !!!!", "red flag, huge red flag.   In no relationship should you have to ask permission.", "No. \nYou can go and do what you want when you are with someone! You let him know, which is kind. Now if he has concerns he can voice them and you two can have an adult conversations about them and if need be you may end up having to cancel out of respect for those concerns and the relationship. However, those are rare rare circumstances.!", "Please don\u2019t marry someone who is exhibiting controlling tendencies like this. You do not need to ask permission to attend an event. Shut that shit down right now. \n\nYou do not owe him an apology. Get his to explain to you why he thinks you aren\u2019t allowed to make decisions as an adult, and what other situations he expects you to seek his permission. NTA", "NTA - youre an adult who can make their own decisions. I get telling your partner your plans, which you did, but you dont need permission.", "Ask for permission? Oh hell no. I don't care who he is.", "NTA mega red flag that he jumped to \"you're not allowed to go\" and \"needing permission\" is disgusting. Even if there is some merit to having friends of the opposite sex, there should be a discussion about concerns so that everyone can discuss concerns and where they stem from.  This is not healthy behavior for a partner and I would not proceed with a marriage unless there is major couples therapy.  Behavior like that tends to get worse after marriage.  Please think carefully, you are an adult who does not need to ask permission and should not feel small due to what a partner says.  Best of luck and stay safe!", "Run \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Red flag alert. Do not proceed with the engagement until you figure out where this controlling behavior is coming from, and the likelihood of it reoccurring. Do proceed with the concert though.", "NTA. Your fiance does not control your life. You don't need to get his permission.", "NTA- I would never ask anyone for permission to do anything, I\u2019m an adult.", "NTA - this is a hill worth dying on, you are a grown adult woman you do NOT need his permission. There were only 2 acceptable responses from him 1) be excited and tell you to have fun. 2) ask if he could come too if he got his own ticket, not out of jealousy but to do something fun with you. But at no point did you need to ask permission.", "NTA red flags here. HUGE red flags here. Dude sounds controlling as hell. GET OUT NOW! Run away while you still can! Do NOT marry this person!", "NTA. But *please,* OP. Don\u2019t marry this person.", "NTA. Depending on what type of person \"K\" is I could possibly understand your fianc\u00e9 having some reservations about the concert, but regardless, using language like \"not allowed\" and demanding that you \"ask permission\" is fucking controlling psycho behavior. I'd strongly encourage you to break off the engagement unless you want to be a slave the rest of your life.", "Nta, that's weird and controlling behavior that's probably only coming out now because you've decided to do something without him so he has no control over what you do there. He probably thought that you would be easy to control this way because your usual preference is in the home, with him, where he thinks you should be. It's quite normal to tell your partner when you plan to do something like this, but not ask permission. Who does he think he is? Your dad?", "Yes men and women can be friends. Since this is a new addition to the friend group, maybe your fianc\u00e9e is seeing warning signs K is not just wanting to be a friend. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wording was inappropriate, but maybe it is out of concern for what he has seen or felt from K\u2019s interactions. \nI personally have been a victim to this type of behavior from a friend once before, and almost a second time until,I put a stop to it.", "NTA\n\nYou are in a controlling relationship that is right on the cusp of abusive.\n\n**DO NOT MARRY THIS GUY**\n\nHe thinks he owns you now, wait until you're married. Heaven forbid you have children.\n\n**This will be your life.**  Being told what you can and cannot do. Even if he takes it back right now, this is how he sees you. As property to be owned and controlled.\n\nYou deserve so much better.", "ESH. \n\nDid he overreact? Yes. But you also need to look at this from his point of view - you're effectively going on a date with another man, that you didn't tell him about beforehand. And \"I got these tickets as a deal\" is a pretty common excuse to get someone you like to go to an event with you. \n\nObviously, I can't know exactly without being in the scenario, but if my fiance sprung that on me, I would be at least a little uncomfortable with it.", "NTA. Bahaha, what has he asked YOUR permission to do? As you obviously own him as well, as his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nYou are not a child and he is not your parent. If he has a grievance or concern he can calmly discuss it with you as an adult partner.", "NTA and huge red flags\n\nYou don\u2019t ask a partner for permission to go. The only reason to ask your partner instead of tell them is if there\u2019s logistics involved (checking you have no plans, confirming that it won\u2019t interfere with other plans that are near it, arranging who is watching the kids if you have them Etc) but that\u2019s it. But that\u2019s not permission that\u2019s making sure you aren\u2019t missing information about your shared schedule as a couple\n\nYou aren\u2019t a teenager he can\u2019t ground you", "NTA\n\nYou will be miserable with this guy if you get married; he's a control freak.\n\nHe wants to own you and run your life. Get out while you can.", "NTA, but I would seriously reconsider marrying this man", "NTA. Why would you ask him for permission? You're not a child, he's not your dad. He is your partner, an equal figure. If you didn't have any plans, there is no need to ask for permission, you were just informing him. Period.", "YTA.  This guy shouldn\u2019t be asking engaged women on concert dates.  The fact he didn\u2019t even give your fianc\u00e9 the respect of letting him first know speaks volumes. \n\nInstead of sympathizing with his emotions, you played the victim.  There\u2019s a difference between being imprisoned/controlled, and hurting your fianc\u00e9s feelings by essentially accepting a date with a dude from college.  A lot of girls like to do these things then play dumb like they didn\u2019t read the situation correctly.", "YTA for multiple reasons.\n\n>This friend, for the purpose of the story I will call him K, is the newest addition to our friend group.

Suddenly it felt like I was a little kid again, being punished by my parents.\n\nThis wasn't a good reaction from your fianc\u00e9, but it is from an understandable position.  There isn't enough information given to provide the context to actually know the truth.\n\nThe reason that I say that you are the AH is based on the information you have provided, but I have one question.\n\n*Is the concert sold out?*\nIf not, why not suggest he get a ticket instead of demanding that it just be you and *your* friend of the opposite sex/gender?\n\nHave you tried to actually find a solution?  Because it doesn't sound like you have, and to be focused on attacking your SO.\n\nHonestly, I think you should probably break off the engagement.  Not because he did anything wrong, but it sounds like you are trying to rationalize your desire to.  This isn't about your \"freedom\" it's about respecting your relationship, and if you can't accept that your relationship is doomed.", ">Excited, I told my fianc\u00e9 these news on our evening walk. Immediately, he started fuming and told me that I am not allowed to go, since I didn\u2019t ask him for permission first.\n\nIf you are expected to ask for ' permission ' to go to a concert, you're not in a healthy relationship. \n\nDoes HE ask for your permission for his plans? \n\nNTA but you need to resolve this , now.
