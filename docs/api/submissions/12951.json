Or at least believe US government warnings that say it is dangerous to go to certain parts of Mexico.\n\nMexico is a wonderful place. But it isn\u2019t *safe*.

I don't understand why Holly won't believe you and your Mom know more about the city you're from than her friends do, and are in a better position to say whether or not it is a safe place to go?!   \n\nWith respect to 'being in touch with her roots', I have opinions. Which you are free to ignore, but it might help to hear from a grown up mixed race woman (half Chinese, half white, grew up in Hong Kong).  \n1. Alicia is only 5. One trip to Juarez isn't going to magically make her more feel more Mexican. I went to Beijing on  a school trip once when I was 10. Didn't make me feel any more or less Chinese. It was just a trip to a foreign country.    \n2. Spending time with you, your Mom, other extended family, any friends with Mexican/Juarez roots, celebrating cultural holidays, is the most important thing for Alicia to build that part of her identity. Especially if she learns to speak Spanish, too. My Mum didn't want me and my brother to be bilingual. Partly to influence what schools we went to, partly because she didn't want us to get sucked into a lot of drama on her side of the family. I still identify strongly with my Chinese heritage (Mum sometimes jokes I'm more Chinese than her, esp when it comes to food and folk traditions), but there is a level of remove there because I don't speak Cantonese fluently.    \n3. Even you telling Alicia that you hate how unsafe Juarez is doesn't stop you from telling her the things that you do appreciate about your heritage, and when she is old enough she can pick and choose for herself. My Mum is one of the most anti-Chinese Chinese people you could meet. I knew this growing up. I also knew that she wasn't putting me down for being half Chinese (or herself for being Chinese), just that she had a lot of frustrations with the culture, and didn't want me to grow up the way she did. Just be honest with Alicia, at an age appropriate level, when she does have questions, and she'll make her own mind up.  \n4. I haven't lived in Hong Kong full time since I was 17. And I haven't been back to visit since 2010. And the Chinese population in the city I currently live in, is neglible. I see my Mum like once a month. I feel more Chinese now than I did when I first moved away. You don't have to visit a place to feel a connection to it, and your cultural awareness isn't only fed by visiting a place - it's interactions with friends and family who share that culture which builds that identity, not simply presence in a place.  \n\nBut yeah, that's just my opinion. Your milage may vary.", "NTA. I'm from a little podunk town in the midwest, and even I have heard of Juarez. Your gf should listen to your mother, and you.", "Little one is your baby too. YOU know what it's like.

Traumatizing your daughter and wife just is not a high priority. They'll feel some kind of way at first, but then actually go to therapy, and let the friends know you're going for the TRAUMA you experienced in your childhood.

Most homicides are targeted assassinations against members of criminal organizations.

It probably won't have the same danger factor as Juarez, but it may make her realize how ridiculous she is being.\n\nDo you have family connections to somewhere else in Mexico that is less dangerous? Maybe you can re-focus her on \"heritage\" there instead of in Juarez.\n\nIt would probably just encourage her if you went to El Paso instead....but that might be an appropriate compromise, especially if you pick a day/time when the lines are likely to be long at the border, so she can't argue that you should cross over \"while you're there\"", ">I dont know if I should listen their word since most of them never visited mexico\n\nHey, I've seen tourist magazines, it's totes safe bro.\n\nSit your wife down, look her dead in the eyes, and tell her that you while you are alive you will not allow your daughter within 100 miles of Juarez.

I also would not want my daughter to come to dislike or fear or be embarrassed by the Mexican part of her being.\n\nYour daughter is still quite young right now so I would suggest talking to her about how your old home is not a safe place to visit right now because there are some bad people who do bad things there. You can also tell her that Juarez is not the only place where her Mexican roots come from, and that there are many other beautiful and safe places in Mexico that you can visit together, including the places you have already been. You can also help your daughter grow to appreciate her Mexican identity by exposing her to other aspects of Mexican culture, such as language (not just Spanish but also the many indigenous languages that predate Spanish... like Yoeme I say because I am Yoeme \ud83d\ude02), literature, history, traditions and celebrations. \n\nAs she gets older you can include more age-appropriate information about why certain places are no-go zones, how they got that way, and what is being done to change it.

They have those rosy American glasses on. I don't think they are being intentionally malicious but they are definitely giving bad advice and demonstrating a lack of understanding.

For several different valid reasons, none being that the home country of mother is unsafe, I've never set foot in Latin America. I still feel a close connection to my roots, and am not ashamed of my heritage.\n \nFor me the most important thing has been all of the other things my mother has done to show that she values we learn about her culture. She taught us Spanish thus making us able to speak to her side of the family, cooked us food frome her childhood, shared the importance of family, and continued with traditions that are practiced in her home country. For instance, we were told that our teeth were collected by el Ratoncito P\u00e9rez instead of the tooth fairy. This is just a small thing, but it was all of those small things that made the difference.\nShe also told us of her childhood and taught us the history of her country, and we have had close contact with my aunt who moved here with my mother.\n\n I don't blame my mother for not being able to take me and my siblings back to show us where she grew up, and I still feel connected to my heritage. \nIf my mother shared her culture with me as much as she could, took me to visit my grandmother in her home country, but explained that the reason she would not take me to the city she grew up was because of the dangers, I would be grateful to her for caring about my safety and understand her reasoning.
