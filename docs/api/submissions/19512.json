Talking man needs to shut up.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not his living room.  You were very appropriate.", "NTA.  Talking during a movie is selfish as hell.  I've told more than one person to be quiet during cinema trips.  You want to talk during a movie, watch it at home instead of spoiling other people's experience.", "NTA. If you said something rude immediately, that would\u2019ve been different but you said \u201cdo you mind?\u201d, which isn\u2019t that rude at all. \n\nTbh it is cinema etiquette to quiet down during a movie and it was the only thing you could do.", "NTA.\n\nYou are there to watch and hear the movie, not him.", "NTA. Shut the fuck up during the movie. How many announcements do they play after the previews?", "NTA. You were polite despite your irritation. You didn't name-call, you weren't aggressive, and you addressed him respectfully. He realized his mistake once you confronted him, and therefore whispered from then on. \n\nYou're concerned that you embarrassed him in front of his son, but that would be on him if he reacted badly to your request, which he didn't. He changed his annoying behavior, which was actually a good thing for his son to witness.  His father made a mistake, and he corrected himself. I wish more people could do that.", "NTA - it's simple movie theater etiquette to not talk during a movie. He was being rude by talking to anyone. It doesn't matter if it was his kid. He can rent at home if he wants to talk.", "NTA  \nIt's actually nice that you're concerned about someone other than yourself. At first, you were more concerned for your gf it seems, and now it looks like you're more concerned about his family. You're still not the asshole, though, because he's not supposed to be talking. Could you have been more polite? Sure. Could he have been more polite and not spoken so loudly? Absolutely. Just think, if he had been polite from the beginning, you probably never would have been bothered.  \n\n\nOne note, speak up sooner, ***before*** you get angry. That will usually curb the need to express irritation so forcefully.", "NTA. \n\nYou were so polite and restrained about it. I'm surprised that he said sure.", "NTA.\n\nIf he can't keep his mouth shut he should stay home and wait until he can stream it.", "NTA. Those people who talk are literally the worst. Good for you for actually saying something.", "nta...nuff said", "Watch the movie at home if you just want to talk. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were trying to watch a damn movie and this guy was talking like he was at a goddamn TED talk. You didn't insult him or start a fucking fight, you simply asked him to shut the fuck up. Maybe you could have worded it better, but who fucking cares? He stopped talking, didn't he? And let's be real, if he wasn't capable of understanding \"do you mind?\" then he's probably too fucking stupid to appreciate Spiderverse anyway.", "NTA", "NTA. You paid money to watch a movie, and it is expected that the audience needs to quiet during the showing of the movie. You were polite to this man. If not for you, someone else would have told him off or called the manager. He was being very rude.", "Unless you are experiencing a life threatening emergency I expect you to be quiet during a movie. We all paid to see the movie not listen to your mouth. So can it til the credits roll. You will never be in the right if you\u2019re talking. Don\u2019t put others in a position to have to ask you to shut up.", "NTA I like hearing comments during a movie thats why I watch at home with friends. I love random funny comments at action movies in the theaters, that\u2019s why I go to the theaters in lower income areas.", "NTA, you were still polite about it.", "NTA - \"sit back, relax, switch off your phone and switch off the outside world\" usual slogan played before a movie about etiquette and one such guideline is no talking during the movie. The occasional yelp of excitement at something? Not a problem. Constant talking? \"You're barred!!!\"", "> Could I have asked it more politely?\n\nI think it's kinda hard to quickly ask someone to quiet down without seeming a bit curt. In theory you could have gone through the whole ultra-polite spiel of \"haha hey buddy enjoying the movie? it's great right? anyway you guys are being a tiny bit loud, could you whisper instead? no worries tho haha\" - but I think you can see what the problem with that is if the whole point is to keep the place quiet lol\n\nSo yeah don't feel bad. It's a good sign regarding your character that your empathy kicked in, but you have nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA - more ppl were bothered by it, but no one dared to say anything. Though, Ive learned to say smth as soon as I find out they\u2019re not going to change it and before I get too annoyed, so it comes out more friendly and constructive. He likely didnt even think about the fact that he was talking, not whispering.\n\nHope you enjoyed the movie \ud83e\udd73", "NTA.\n\nYou were polite, considering he actually deserved a punch in the head!\n\nPeople who talk in cinemas are antisocial types who truly are deserving of a good flogging or maybe death by firing squad!", "NTA.
