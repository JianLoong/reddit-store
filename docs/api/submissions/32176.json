Is your family paying for any part of the wedding?\n2. Are you prepared to deal with the lifelong consequences of cutting off your family?", "NTA: but if you do decide to invite them, make sure the officiant does not do the \"if anyone objects\" part (which is mostly a Hollywood convention, but some do it).", "NTA  \nSome people would think you would be the AH for inviting them. They insult your fiance and do not support this marriage. Most likely they will be horrible to both your fiance and his family.

You don\u2019t insult your kids fianc\u00e9 unless there\u2019s an extremely good reason and there isn\u2019t one here. It\u2019s your wedding, you and your fianc\u00e9 get to decide what happens.", "NTA uninvite them because they are unsupportive but not because they have chosen their preferred accommodations and scheduled additional travel.  Destination weddings are all well and good (I am assuming        international travel is required), you can\u2019t really fault those who choose to extend their travel when they have already invested in travelling that far.

But I would just urge you to make sure you and your spouse to be are compatible.  You have cultural and class differences that may show up later in marriage.   Talk about all the major issues through before getting married, money, children, religions.  \n\nAlso, dont alienate them. While I hope you have a long and happy marriage, things dont always work out and you may need or want your family in the future.", "As someone who grew up in England, where there are still quite a lot of differences between the social classes, your upper class, \"very privileged\" family, if they are at all snobbish, may find very little in common with their \"lower class\" future in-laws. It's really a pity, because working class people in England are among the funniest, most down to earth individuals you could ever hope to meet. They could all have so much fun together, if your family doesn't try to impress and put on airs. If you don't uninvite all your American relatives, which I would be tempted to do in your place, I hope all goes well. I can certainly understand you not wanting to alienate yourself from your family, especially if it has never been an issue before you and your fiance met. \n\nCongratulations and best wishes.

I thought most people let the guests fend for themselves.\n\nI believe the mistake is yours for trying to book for your guests, and for inviting family who you knew were hostile to the marriage. I believe YWBTA for pulling a bait and switch if you disinvited your family for reasons such as those you shared.", "NTA. There is such a thing as 'chosen family', which is what we have when our birth family behaves dismally.

The second time. I had absolulty no family except my children present. We had friends we could trust and classed as our family instead.  I am old enough to be your mother. So take this from someone who had to cut her entire family away.\n\nYour finance is sensible living at home and saving rather than spending thousands on dead rent money.  There is nothing wrong with working from home.   His weight is nobody else's business. \n\nDoes he make you happy?  If the answer is yes and you have already discussed future plans such as living arrangements. Then they need to back off. \n\nIf your mother was sincere about attending, she would be staying with you. Supporting you. And doing whatever you needed to help you relx and enjoy every moment..\nYou mentioned your from a privileged background, which makes me wonder if your father does nothing,  because a divorce could be costly.  That's no excuse.   A parent should support and protect their child. \n\nInstead, they have purposely avoided you and made snubs about your wedding and choice of fiance. I suspect your mother only wants to attend, because it won't look good on her part if it's found she was not invited. Or to look down on you, cause a scene, and try and stop the wedding. \n\nI regret having my parents at my first wedding. They found fault with everything, and my dad refused to walk me down the Isle if he had to wear a pink shirt, (yup  he thought \"pink was for gays\". He is a homphobic moron!.  They spent the entire time with bils and sils  bitching about everything, they took every opportunity it to either make it about them or make fun.  My nm didn't come dress shopping, she didn't care. The lowest blow  was when they had offered to watch my son on the day of the wedding and on the day said no. \"I should have thought about having kids before I got married harder, they were there to enjoy a party\"\n\nIt was stressful, and no matter how hard I tried to please either of them  it wasn't good enough.   \n\nOn my second wedding I had no stress because my best friends and our own family  were absolulty amazing and supportive. Nothing was too much trouble, lots of excitement and no stress. Oh and we  got the brightest colours and everyone had a blast not wearing standard attire . \n\nThey will get worse, and they will push more boundaries. If you ever have children, she will find a way to make it about her. \n\nPersonally, I would say uninvite them. Have a best friend walk you up the Isle, or walk up together.  She has had years to change her behaviour.  I would recommend hiring security so they don't turn up and cause a scene.  If they want to fix the relationship, they can do it after the wedding. To show their commitment to it.  They clearly had other plans  to  vacation elsewhere.  \n\nPlease enjoy your day with your finance. I send you huge congratulations. Don't spend your day with regret. Your notnthere to please others. This is you and your finances day. X", "NTA. Uninvite them and then have security at the door to make sure they don't get in.", "Uninvite them and fast. Lol.", "It's a legal requirement in the UK. If they do come tell the officiant that there is a possibility that your family will be difficult. Ask what they do if someone objects.

He did not write the cheque.", "From the Book of Common Prayer, in the seevice of Holy Matrimony: *\"Therefore if any man can shew any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.\"*", "Wise advice.", "It's pretty normal to book a group of rooms for close family IME.", "It can be for a destination wedding, though if the couple can afford it, they might pre book a block of rooms & pay a deposit", "What bsit and switch?
