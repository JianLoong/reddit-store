It worked out great for us. Someone was always home for the kids. I also had Mon-Thrus off. This was great during the summer. Anyway, if money for child care is the problem, maybe working opposite shifts can be an option. \nMy mom also started a trust for both my girls.

It was available to them when they turned 25. It was a very sizable amount. My sister was pissed because there wasn't  one for her kids. But a letter in Mom's will stated why, that there was a trust for her kids way back when. Since her kids turned 14, not once did any of them ever say \"thank you\" for anything ever given to them from her and grampy. Not one phone call, card, or email. Not once did her kids ever want to spend any time with the grandparents unless a gift or money was involved. That my sis never attempted to have the girls be part of their lives. There's a bit more, but I'm already rambling. So mom got rid of their trust fund. If my sister wanted to, she could give whatever she wanted to her girls. But it would come from her portion of the inheritance. Boy, was she mad. Why was I getting more than anyone else. No, I got my share, that's it. Not my fault that my kids were brought up differently than hers. \n\nAnywho.... the OP isn't TAH. If the MIL wants to use the trust for leverage, I'd tell her to keep it.

We lived on a windy, narrow road with no sidewalks, but my MIL found a stroller without my approval and took her for walks along the road without telling me. I'd come home to no baby, no MIL, no note, no text... Not great for a mom struggling with anxiety. I also found MIL in the kitchen one day with the baby in her car seat on the counter, with MIL yanking a strap to make the seat rock back and forth. My poor baby was dazed.\n\nOk, that was a lot about me lol. Point is, don't put up with it. You are the parent, make your choices clear. You don't need to explain yourself or your reasons.
