You are the parent, you set your boundaries. It really is that simple.\n\nBut to solidify why she\u2019s TA: You\u2019re not forcing her to watch your bub and be stuck in a house all day. She quits, then cries that you\u2019re not allowing her access, so it seems like while you are benefitting from her watching your kid, her motive is just to spend time with them. Not that she\u2019s doing it expressly to help you.\n\nShe sounds dramatic and threatening to close a trust fund bc she doesn\u2019t get her way is her trying to exert financial control.", "You don\u2019t have a MIL problem. You have a husband problem. These are your husband\u2019s parents. It\u2019s his job to tell them no. It\u2019s his job to enforce rules with them. It\u2019s his job to tell them that if they can\u2019t follow your rules, threaten you and the baby, or blow up in any way, you will go LC with them. If during LC times, they further can\u2019t get it together, you will go NC with them. \n\nYou should stop relying on them at all for babysitting and hire a professional or part time preschool that you pay for when your mom can\u2019t take him. That way, your MIL has no leverage.", "NTA. You've already told her your boundaries as a parent, she should respect them and she's not. Your husband really needs to be on the same page as you, no matter what his mom says or does. What she's found out is that throwing a tantrum and complaining to her son will get her what she wants. \n\nI think you and your husband really need to sit down and hash out the rules for grandma and then make sure that both of you are telling her the same thing. When she starts making a fuss don't rise to the bait, just reiterate that you've already discussed this with her and you're not changing your mind.", "NTA. You are the parent and you and your husband are the ones who get to decide who does what with your baby. Period.", "You are NTA. She bought a car to \u201ctake him wherever she wants?\u201d That is weird. My mom has NPD and sounds like something she would do.

It\u2019s your child and you are in charge no matter how much that frustrates her.", "\"since your trust fund comes with strings attached and you can't follow simple safety as NO phone while driving, you can keep it all only see your grandson at our house or when we are able to visit you\"", "NTA. Car accidents kill too many kids. And many people secure child sears wrong!", "NTA, and, WTF?!?  Of course you shouldn't let her take your 9mo child.  To a mall??  What's there that a 9mo would care about?", "YTA because your comments throughout and in the post indicate your MIL is unstable, an alcoholic, and irresponsible, and you allow her to watch your child despite this.  \n\nYou trying to draw a line now is too much, too little, and too late.", "NTA The baby is 9 months old, and over an hour away is too far that young. There is nothing wrong wanting to be close to YOUR child lest something happens and you need to get to them quickly.", "Why does she want to put baby in a \ncarseat and go to a mall?  In the cold.  \nThat's a slightly wierd request.  \nDefinitely say no.", "Info: why exactly are you not comfortable with her taking him more than ten mins from her house? That is extreme. \n\nYou either trust her as a babysitter or you don\u2019t. If you do, 70 minutes isn\u2019t far. If you don\u2019t, she shouldn\u2019t watch your kid.", "YTA Because you know she texts and drives but allow her to do it with your baby within a ten minute radius.", "These are always tricky situations because MIL is doing you a *huge* favor by providing free childcare. I would find it difficult to impose rules on someone who was doing me that big of a favor free of charge. Plus they have a trust fund set up for the baby? Difficult situation indeed. \n\nIf you keep a hard line here, be prepared to have to find alternative childcare (unless your mom would be happy to make 4 days a week a permanent schedule). \n\nNAH because I don't think it's unreasonable for MIL to want to drive more than 10 minutes away with the baby when she's doing this free service for you. Unless she has a terrible driving record that makes you think shes susceptible to accidenta. But i also don't think you're an AH for looking out for the child's safety.", "Baby is 9 months old, \u2026.so I\u2019m not really seeing a problem with MIL  taking him to mall that is outside your prescribed acceptable distance\u2026.the Escalade is a safe vehicle and you\u2019ve not stated any real concerns about MIL\u2026.so maybe you\u2019re a slight YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
