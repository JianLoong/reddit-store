I think she honestly isn\u2019t able to control it without putting a TON of active thought and effort into it, and that\u2019s not something she wants to prioritize. But she\u2019d also be the first one offering to replace or fix whatever was broken, it\u2019s wild to me that OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t even really seem sorry.", "I don't think the OP is wrong to be upset or to ask that she be more careful but I think screaming at her and the language he used is over the top so it's more of an ESH", "Start shitting on her seat.", "I don\u2019t think so. Not hint that was said was rude just spitting fact. The reason that people in society are worthless is they all have main character syndrome and never take accountability.", "Yeah I also think ESH for slightly different reasons.\n\nOP shouldn't be putting food on places where people sit and then complaining that people sit there and knock it over. I mean... just what? Especially YELLING at her over knocking over food is insane? Like damn it happens, get a coffee table dude. Saying \"I leave food all over the couches randomly\" etc makes OP sound like a slob.\n\nThat said, electronics are more understandable and one should definitely expect some electronics to be on the couch. Edit: also I missed it in the OP, but OP says his wife is the one that left in on the couch too. So that was definitely doubly irresponsible of her.\n\nAnd yeah, setting a baseline that you can yell at your partner indefinitely when they make you mad is not healthy. I totally understand being frustrated, but yeesh, it also kind of sounds like OP has anger problems.\n\nFor example, my bf broke my laptop due to carelessness, and I certainly did not yell at him, or anything even close to it. I was in college at the time too and needed it too! Generally, people seem to think yelling is okay, when they're not the ones being yelled at. My guess is if it was OP that made a mistake and got screamed at, he'd suddenly think screaming was wrong.", "Why did I have to scroll so long to find this?

For me it is earnestly NOT malicious (and I guess I could attribute it to my severe ADD, but I\u2019m not sure) and it definitely isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t care about other people or their things.\n\n\nI will say, I have trained myself not to care about stuff (or my stuff, at all!) and to basically never own expensive things, as a coping mechanism. It works pretty perfectly. If I never own expensive pants, it never matters if I stain or tear them. And I NEVER borrow important items from other people.", "All of us?", "Yeah.

This is something that can be trained like a skill; if she is very intelligent and able to gain new skills, she can probably master this quickly and perhaps cross-apply it to other areas of her life that require more detailed attention.\n\nSo if your wife decided to use this, she might go up to what she wants to sit on, point at it (or brush it off casually, which is a normal thing to do), make a note that it's clear for her to sit on it (probably mentally), and then sit. This will draw her attention to the place she's about to sit to make sure it's in the right state for her to sit on it. Another idea is for her to have something to sit on that she puts down first, like a handkerchief, \"to protect her clothes\" is a good polite excuse.\n\nA side note is that if she's really traumatized from sitting on an anthill she may be even more avoidant of looking before she sits because she might not want to have to confront the idea she's about to sit on something nasty/pointy/bitey.

I'm going to assume that his wife hasn't been severely depressed or struggling with some other mental illness for the entirety of their relationship\n\nI'm instead going to assume that she does actually care whether or not she hurts herself, traumatises herself, embarrasses herself, etc\n\nwhich means she's tried and failed\n\nthat doesn't mean that she is incapable of learning or doing anything about this\n\nIT MEANS SHE NEEDS TO TRY OTHER THINGS AND LEARN OTHER WAYS\n\nthis by the way is something that's true for just about everyone regardless of their neurology. people learn things in different ways and take different routes to the same end goal. if you're reminding someone of something everyday and it doesn't make a difference then that is probably not the best way for them to learn\n\nand she almost certainly doesn't need a diagnosis to find and try other things\n\nthe majority of the resources she likely needs will be found under ADHD resources. she can read ADHD stuff without having a diagnosis (and yes even without having ADHD) and she can still benefit from it! she can benefit from a therapist who specialises in ADHD whether or not she has it. because they'll be well versed in things like adaptive mechanisms for poor proprioception, inattentiveness, difficult switching focuses, etc\n\nin this case SHE left something on the sofa, forgot, and sat on it. constantly checking where she sits is one way to handle that situation but another way to handle that situation is that every single time she gets up she moves her stuff to the table in front of her. that might be an easier thing for her to implement while she works on other things\n\nbut simply telling her to do better isn't going to change anything\n\nshe needs to figure out what parts of this are hard for her and what parts are easier or what things help and that is a really difficult thing to do on your own without any support or resources\n\nand she deserves support and resources regardless of her neurotype\n\noh and btw? the entire point of ADHD is that we have interest based attention systems. it's extremely common for people with ADHD to thrive in high pressure jobs and then not be able to transfer those skills to other settings because their brain literally responds differently. that's one of the most basic things about ADHD to understand precisely so that you can figure out how to make things work\n\nyou sound like every goofus telling ADHD people just to try harder when in reality we generally need to try differently. trying harder can work for awhile for some people, but usually causes burnout and crash. working with your brain is gentler, easier, and sustainable and what everyone deserves\n\noh and btw? people with ADHD aren't all alike and don't all have the same capacity. some need a lot more supports or different supports and that's okay too", "if you really think that this woman sat in VOMIT and an ANT HILL and was deeply traumatised by that and still just doesn't care enough to try? \n\nthen you should be encouraging OP to get his wife help because if you don't care if you get hurt and traumatised and so on, you're not okay. those are signs of severe depression or other mental illnesses\n\nhowever I think it's much more likely that OPs wife simply needs to learn how to do things differently and in a way that's compatible with her brain. and that's honestly much easier and there are lots of great resources readily available", "What country is \u201cthe whole country\u201d?", "That sounds nice and all, but you\u2019re saying you should never get mad at your wife. This is a ridiculous double standard that treats women like they are children. There a reason 99% of the comment section disagrees with your take. Saying the husband is an asshole in this situation is delusion", "Fellow ADHD person, and I agree. I have trained myself to *constantly* check myself like this. \n\nStill have issues with postural sway and general clumsiness. So many bumps and bruises.\n\nToday, I have inadvertently knocked over the broom, the shop-vac, some boxes near the trash bin, a glass of water on the coffee table, and have dropped the same bag 3 times and my fork. I stub my toes so much I don't hardly notice.", "Smart people with something like ADHD would make the same mistake over and over", "Wow, today I learned everyone with any kind of memory-affecting disability is actually just stupid.", "Sighs in: spilled ice tea this morning, egg dumped on the floor while cooking, milk sprayed all over the kitchen also while cooking, one dropped tv remote, one dropped ps5 controller, spilled pet water\u2026 and that was all before noon. Lol.", "Leaving it on the couch is normal tho if you are going to use it so leave it there to pick up afterwards", "so based", "Fr. My goblin monk has a high wisdom stat, and didnt know wtf was seaweed until she had a mission near the sea", "This is what I was going to mention. My partner and I have had some Spicy Conversations about my habit of knocking drinks over, until I explained to him that when he sets a drink down, it gets noted in his mental map of the space around him, so when he goes to reach for something he automatically adjusts around that. But when I set a drink down, its location never makes it to the mental map, it goes into a temporary buffer and gets overwritten by the next thing I'm focused on. So as far as my mental map goes, it doesn't exist, and when I go to reach for something my brain won't account for the drink and whoops there it goes.\n\nThat said, having a mental blind spot like that is still something you can be expected to work around. My solution was drinks with lids. I use lidded water bottles for things like juices or water or whatever, and buy bottles of soda rather than cans. Now if I knock it over, it's not getting everywhere.\n\nTruth told I'm not sure what the equivalent to that would be in this situation."]}
