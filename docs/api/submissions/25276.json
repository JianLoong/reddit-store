I think she honestly isn\u2019t able to control it without putting a TON of active thought and effort into it, and that\u2019s not something she wants to prioritize. But she\u2019d also be the first one offering to replace or fix whatever was broken, it\u2019s wild to me that OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t even really seem sorry.", "I don't think the OP is wrong to be upset or to ask that she be more careful but I think screaming at her and the language he used is over the top so it's more of an ESH", "Start shitting on her seat.", "I don\u2019t think so. Not hint that was said was rude just spitting fact. The reason that people in society are worthless is they all have main character syndrome and never take accountability.", "Yeah I also think ESH for slightly different reasons.\n\nOP shouldn't be putting food on places where people sit and then complaining that people sit there and knock it over. I mean... just what? Especially YELLING at her over knocking over food is insane? Like damn it happens, get a coffee table dude. Saying \"I leave food all over the couches randomly\" etc makes OP sound like a slob.\n\nThat said, electronics are more understandable and one should definitely expect some electronics to be on the couch. Edit: also I missed it in the OP, but OP says his wife is the one that left in on the couch too. So that was definitely doubly irresponsible of her.\n\nAnd yeah, setting a baseline that you can yell at your partner indefinitely when they make you mad is not healthy. I totally understand being frustrated, but yeesh, it also kind of sounds like OP has anger problems.\n\nFor example, my bf broke my laptop due to carelessness, and I certainly did not yell at him, or anything even close to it. I was in college at the time too and needed it too! Generally, people seem to think yelling is okay, when they're not the ones being yelled at. My guess is if it was OP that made a mistake and got screamed at, he'd suddenly think screaming was wrong.", "Why did I have to scroll so long to find this?

Losing your temper is completely understandable here.", "I don't think you read the post well, bc OP clearly stated that he has been avoiding putting things down on places where she sits, and that this time, *she* was the one who left the macbook on the couch and then sat on it.

For me it is earnestly NOT malicious (and I guess I could attribute it to my severe ADD, but I\u2019m not sure) and it definitely isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t care about other people or their things.\n\n\nI will say, I have trained myself not to care about stuff (or my stuff, at all!) and to basically never own expensive things, as a coping mechanism. It works pretty perfectly. If I never own expensive pants, it never matters if I stain or tear them. And I NEVER borrow important items from other people.", "All of us?", "Yeah.

This is something that can be trained like a skill; if she is very intelligent and able to gain new skills, she can probably master this quickly and perhaps cross-apply it to other areas of her life that require more detailed attention.\n\nSo if your wife decided to use this, she might go up to what she wants to sit on, point at it (or brush it off casually, which is a normal thing to do), make a note that it's clear for her to sit on it (probably mentally), and then sit. This will draw her attention to the place she's about to sit to make sure it's in the right state for her to sit on it. Another idea is for her to have something to sit on that she puts down first, like a handkerchief, \"to protect her clothes\" is a good polite excuse.\n\nA side note is that if she's really traumatized from sitting on an anthill she may be even more avoidant of looking before she sits because she might not want to have to confront the idea she's about to sit on something nasty/pointy/bitey.

Your girlfriend is the AH because of the defensive reaction but again, I dont think it\u2019s an atypical reaction and done just because she is an AH, it\u2019s self defense.

The not seeing details like things she\u2019s about to sit on makes me think it too. I don\u2019t want to give an armchair diagnosis but it could also give insight into her reaction- which isn\u2019t an excuse, its still something she\u2019s responsible for managing, but emotional regulation is another common issue for adhders. It\u2019s a skill that isn\u2019t really taught so even lot of neurotypical people struggle with it too, but that also means people can improve it-like any other skill.

I don\u2019t struggle with this particular problem so I can\u2019t have offer any super helpful suggestions unfortunately, but she needs some sort of cue to help her remember to check or her seat choosing options need to be specific so she has to actually pause and think before she sits.

Adults should have more common sense than to sit on a bunch of things without even looking\u2026", "I think she needed to be talked to harshly in this situation, but I totally agree. She may have ADHD or some other neurological issue. When I get really depressed, I become way more clumsy for instance. A sleep issue can cause this too, your brain feels like shit when you are chronically not well rested. BUT! She is an adult and needs to take this as a wake up call that her clumsiness is more than a quirk, it is harming her relationships with people. She needs to figure *something* out.", "I figured that was were the story was going. He knows his wife is a klutz and sits on stuff and he put it on a kitchen chair or something. But this is 100% on her and I'd be pretty mad.", "Puts baby on couch to grab something. Sits down on couch to breastfeed baby. Where did baby go? Ohh no! Baby broke, none months of hard work just wasted.", "I have a chihuahua terrier mix and she loves being under blankets and, like all dogs, just hanging out on the sofa. Sometimes I'll slowly lower my butt over her and act like I'm going to sit on her, saying \"oooooh nooooo! I hope there's not a dog here!\" thinking she'll dart out at the last minute but she just sits there wagging her tail. She fucking loves the smush! (I always avert last moment and only half smush, mostly leaning to the side).", "I have a biewer. Really small (2.5 kg), loves to lie as close to me as possible, and/or under blankets, and has soft fur which resembles that of a blanket or cushion. I've leant to look for him before  sitting anywhere.", "At least he had an excuse: he was so high he didn\u2019t know what he was doing", "What, was it barking ?", "I think it\u2019s pretty normal to put things down next to you if you\u2019re sitting on a couch or to leave things on chairs. It\u2019s not pretty normal to never look before you sit down - what if they have a small pet or child??", "Has she checked or heard of dyspraxia? It's a learning difficulty that effects balance, usually always seen as being clumsy. My nephew has it, and I wouldn't be surprised if my brother has it as well because he's constantly unaware of what his body is doing, and he can't ride a bike. My nephew walks/runs into walls, and no amount of telling him to be careful would stop him because he's dyspraxic.\n\nDyspraxia and dyslexia are closely related and can show the same symptoms, but the former has physical symptoms as well.", "She needs to pay for the screen replacement, not you", "Sure but as a functioning adult you should look where you sit. Single or in a relationship.", "Haha wamens amirite gtfo", "i have ADHD. My entire family has ADHD. I can't tell you how many things of ours - priceless things - have been accidentally broken or ruined by myself or others in my family. It sucks, especially when it's something of ours that someone else broke. We try not to make the same mistakes again. We don't always succeed. We don't always take it well. We forgive each other. I have an anxiety disorder from trying to manage my ADHD, and i still mess up every day. Look, if my partner screamed at me after i accidentally sat on his laptop and broke the screen, I'd understand. I'd probably cry like a baby, but I'd feel completely awful and ashamed and I'd get why he was that upset. If he thought i *deserved* to be screamed at, i would fucking break up with him. Nobody *deserves* to be berated in that manner over an accident. Holy shit. Like, some of you guys, i just don't get what your thought process is, that she hasn't been verbally abused for it enough for her to stop sitting in puke? Is it that you don't think she feels guilty? You don't think she feels ashamed? Do you think maybe she wanted to sit on an anthill? Do you think that maybe there's a certain amount of screaming where her brain chemistry will function appropriately every time afterwards and she'll always watch where she sits? What is it about a pervasive mental disorder you don't understand?", "For his behaviour?\n\nIf his behaviour hurt his wife, he should feel sorry for that. If his behaviour was the result of something hurtful she did, that's a separate issue.\n\nYou don't get to be hurtful because somebody hurt you, that's not how this works. It doesn't matter \"who's right\", what matters is whether or not you take responsibility for your actions. Frankly we don't know whether or not the wife has taken responsibility for her actions, we only know that she keeps doing it. Perhaps it's a bad habit. You may have heard of them? Perhaps you even have one or two? How's it going trying to stop that bad habit? Have you successfully banished it yet?", "Wow, what a problem solver! A lot of cats would take it personally and just give dirty looks and run away", "I oughta suffocate you!", "I totally get it. I was just wondering if someone is  living with someone like her, don't they somehow develop extra cautiousness?", "No, it likely won\u2019t. I replaced my MacBook retina screen through Apple repair sans AppleCare and it was in the $600-$800 range iirc. I mailed it off and they repaired it at a central facility, maybe it costs more if you drop it off at the apple store? A wider screen might cost more but so would the laptop MSRP. If MacBooks didn\u2019t retain a decent amount of retail value it might not be made the same sense, but I figured the cost of the repair was still much less than what I could sell the laptop for (with a working screen), so a repair still made sense, even though it was expensive.", "Wow. Reason #124 why I will never go Apple. I've replaced so many screens in broken laptops/chrome books/phones/tablets myself. Just today I was taking apart an old tablet to see if I could re-use the screen with my Pi or an Arduino. Making repair nearly impossible to drive up sales is so predatory!", "Sounds more like add because there seems to be no hyperactivity. Source: I have add.", "> Frankly we don't know whether or not the wife has taken responsibility for her actions\n\nNow you\u2019re ignoring the post. \n\n> She called me a jerk for talking down to her because I have asked her many to look where she sits\n\nShe has never apologised for her behaviour. Your opinion does not align with reality assuming the post is real.", "It could also be autism spectrum. I have a hard time noticing the floor when I'm walking, unless ALL I'm doing is staring at the floor. I'm usually focused on a task and end up stepping on a lot of stuff. My husband is always telling me I need to look where I'm going, but my brain simply doesn't have room for that, especially if it's been a stressful day.  \n\n\nI also struggle to moderate my tone. When I get excited, I talk loudly. No matter how many times I got excited and talked too loud and got in trouble, I literally could not control it. It was terrible to always be admonished and in trouble for something I couldn't control. I feel for this woman.", "I'm curious what you mean by \"weaponised incompetence\"? Is it some kind of power play that she's doing? I'm genuinely asking what you mean here.", "How does this...\n\n>She called me a jerk for talking down to her because I have asked her many to look where she sits\n\nIndicate that she's **never** apologized for her behavior?", "Weaponised incompetence is a buzzword this subreddit throws around whenever they think a man should be fully capable of doing something but doesn\u2019t have the ability to do it (for example him not doing chores \u201cproperly\u201d or basically the sentiment of \u201cI\u2019m so bad at this can you handle all of this work?\u201d so the wife has to take on more).\n\nShe\u2019s basically amounting to \u201cI can\u2019t tell myself to not sit on hazardous stuff so can you work your life around that?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry but if you cannot understand being repeatedly told to not sit on expensive stuff to the point it had caused measurable financial and professional loss to the family, to the point that your spouse is having a mental breakdown, it is an example of weaponised incompetence.", "Anyone apologetic for destroying someone\u2019s property wouldn\u2019t be calling them a jerk for asking them repeatedly to not take an action that would result in that.", "That's not the same thing at all and it should be obvious. Being aware of gross motor and items around the body in space is a completely different skill domain than being able to use fine motor and hyper focus to do something tiny, intricate, and up-close! \n\nOP himself admits she hyper-focuses. Please, can we not burn people at the moral stake for stuff that's possibly hard-wired in the brain until a doctor does a battery of assessments. \n\nOP,  you are trashing your wife in these comments. I realize that you are angry but I really feel concern that there is something deeper going on here.", "I understand what you mean by weaponized incompetence now, but I don't yet agree that it's most likely the case.\n\nI don't see her play here.\n\nDo you think it's something that serves her in some way and that because of that she hasn't stopped doing it?", "Almost everyone who is getting shouted at is going to call the shouter a jerk.", "Are you familiar with what hyperfocusing means in the context of neurodivergence? In that situation someone isn't *choosing* to hyperfocus in a way that a surgeon does. It's a symptom that needs to be managed in a way beyond just saying, \"Think before you do [insert thing] while hyperfocusing\" because the external world ceases to exist and they're not thinking about anything else except the singular thing they're hyperfocusing on. You're talking about a very different type of focus that doesn't apply here.", "My kids are both autistic and severe ADHD, but super smart. I've observed for several years how they don't seem aware of their surroundings or other items in space that they are about to sit on or walk on. It's a total lack of spatial & situational awareness more than social cues. I see their body just move (poorly) and they are imagining what's around, possibly because they are overwhelmed by the billions of thoughts inside their minds. It's like they can't stop thinking about the thing, stop to check physical surroundings, then move body. Injuries galore. I used to get hit for the kind of accidents they get into. But I can see that this is a disconnect in the brain for them. \n\nFrom what OP says about wife's intelligence it may be something like that? Only OP would know. \n\nA person who is neurodivergent usually takes things way, way harder than other people (because they are ashamed of themselves) and experiences intense pain (\"rejection dysphoria\") when someone talks to them in a hateful way (like cursing at them with \"why the fuck\" and using terms like never/always etc.)\n\nI realize your computer is expensive OP, and I'm sorry this happened, but, was there a better way to speak to her in this case? You are probably the one person she feels safe with. If you said this impulsively, own it and talk to her. If you have a kid, how would you talk to them about it? \n\nCouldn't you, knowing this is her body's way of working, just be more careful about not putting things where they can be sat on? Don't put food on an ottoman, don't place items on the couch? Use tables. I can't fully say you are the A-H but I mean .. are you willing to learn and make plans how to live with this issue she has more skillfully, or do you expect her to somehow change? Bc this doesn't sound like something that she CAN change. Maybe couple's therapy would help."]}
