Edit: also I missed it in the OP, but OP says his wife is the one that left in on the couch too. So that was definitely doubly irresponsible of her.\n\nAnd yeah, setting a baseline that you can yell at your partner indefinitely when they make you mad is not healthy. I totally understand being frustrated, but yeesh, it also kind of sounds like OP has anger problems.\n\nFor example, my bf broke my laptop due to carelessness, and I certainly did not yell at him, or anything even close to it. I was in college at the time too and needed it too! Generally, people seem to think yelling is okay, when they're not the ones being yelled at. My guess is if it was OP that made a mistake and got screamed at, he'd suddenly think screaming was wrong.", "Why did I have to scroll so long to find this? OP and his wife seem to have a deep lack of respect for each other. Both of them are assholes; her for not doing something he\u2019s asked her to time and time again and breaking his mac, and him for speaking to her that way! Jesus Christ! ESH", "She left the computer on the sofa", "Why can't OP have both the Macbook and trust that his stuff won't be broken so casually?", "Apparently, he's already done that multiple times and it didn't change anything. Losing your temper is completely understandable here.", "I don't think you read the post well, bc OP clearly stated that he has been avoiding putting things down on places where she sits, and that this time, *she* was the one who left the macbook on the couch and then sat on it. So she either forgot that she put it there, which is her fault, or she remembered it was on the couch but didn't bother to make sure she wasn't going to sit on it, which is her fault.", "How's OP the one putting his Macbook in danger?", "Suffocated with love", "That was different.. she crawled under there. For warmth.", "I *really* need to know the story of how she sat in puke. Why was it not cleaned up??", "Unless you have Apple Care, replacing the screen will cost just as much as the laptop itself.

Third+ time, willful disregard.", "I would have learned after sitting in vomit, on an ant hill or a fucking spider ya.", "She just doesn\u2019t seem to care then. You can still be absorbed into whatever and still being able to make sure  you don\u2019t sit onto things or ran into something. It\u2019s the most basic common sense. She\u2019s already this bad, what if you two have kids or small animals around. She gotta fix that behavior.", "Does she have ADHD ??", "Not to mention the toll it takes on your spine, which I hear is significantly harder to replce.\n\nI used to do this, as a kid. Much like you, I simply learned not to.\n\nSounds like the wife is just inconsiderate. It's her problem if she sits in puke again, whatever. But it's becoming other people's problem, in an expensive way. Mindfulness isn't that hard.", "So I\u2019m not as bad as your wife, but I constantly whack my husband in the face and knock shit over, I lose things constantly and I definitely have never in my life looked before I sat down. \n\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to make my brain DO that. It\u2019s like if someone demanded I stick out my tongue before every time I called someone by name.\n\n\n\nHow long would it take you to form that habit? Insanely difficult right? For me it is earnestly NOT malicious (and I guess I could attribute it to my severe ADD, but I\u2019m not sure) and it definitely isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t care about other people or their things.\n\n\nI will say, I have trained myself not to care about stuff (or my stuff, at all!) and to basically never own expensive things, as a coping mechanism. It works pretty perfectly. If I never own expensive pants, it never matters if I stain or tear them. And I NEVER borrow important items from other people.", "All of us?", "Yeah. Stressful situation plus poor coping skills.\n\nLast night we were putting together a bookshelf. I didn't realize the particle board back panel was still in the box, so I stood up and broke the \"empty\" box in half over my knee, snapping the panel in half and ruining our plans. My wife and I did have a little disagreement about it today, but only because she'd been teasing me mercilessly for 12 hours straight and I needed a break. Then we got a replacement from IKEA and now we have a nice bookshelf.\n\nJust wanted to tell someone because it's hilarious. Like I literally did a backbreaker on this thing like it was a Mortal Kombat fatality. Point is, we all make mistakes, sometimes repeatedly. Be nice to each other!", "Fair.

I wouldn\u2019t want my MD to be clumsy and careless like this\u2026", "She\u2019s a resident doctor? Am I understanding that correctly?

There\u2019s nothing to be done I\u2019m afraid. Their heads are too full for common sense. NTA though, they all are!", "There's intelligence, and there's common sense. They do not necessarily correlate. You would hope her intelligence would allow her to deduce she should look before sitting after suffering negative consequences because she didn't. Unfortunately, for some, their utter lack of common sense overrides what their brain should be telling them. If she was a (very) young child, this might be excusable. For an adult to continue to do something after multiple bad outcomes AND someone telling them repeatedly to *look* before you sit ffs! Not excusable, in the least. And now she owes you a computer.", "Does she have adhd?", "I guess with all that book knowledge she has no room left for common sense and consideration for others. That\u2019s disappointing. You are not the ahole. She is because she has no remorse and was rude when you expressed valid anger.", "Stupid is as stupid does.\nShe's an idiot in practice unfortunately.", "As a very smart woman with ADD, I bet she\u2019s got ADD.", "Well good thing she\u2019s going to be a doctor, so she can afford to replace your mac book. Definitely NTA, if you\u2019ve gently suggested to be more careful and she\u2019s had multiple mishaps already tbh I think I would have reacted more strongly than you did lol", "When you talk to someone like that the conversation becomes about how you said what you said instead of the issue at hand. Apologize for how you talked to her. I\u2019d say something like I was really frustrated because this is a long standing issue and because that\u2019s an expensive computer. I shouldn\u2019t have talked to you that way and I\u2019m sorry I did. Then the two of you talk about how to resolve the situation. It seems fair to me to ask her to replace it and also set a new rule like she don\u2019t use your stuff.

Maybe she can take a test and graduate with honors but that doesn't make her not an idiot.", "Ha, sounds a lot like my wife.

A $3000 completely avoidable \"accident\" would probably warrant another round.  When I said screaming, I don't mean some psychotic outbreak, I just mean loud, well articulated declarations.  No drooling, incoherent ramblings, flailing arms or anything of that nature.\n\nAnyway, accidents rarely just happen, especially the same one, over and over.  They're the result of an unbroken broken chain of preventable failures. When someone is constantly having the same \"accident\", there is an underlying cause that needs to be addressed.  As OP clearly stated, she has been repeating this behavior to the point that OP has to take on the responsibility of always performing preventative damage control by moving things around.", "Explain it for me.", "Eh reading skill at 0 i suppose?\nShe out the laptop there and then sat on it, so how did he put it in danger, other than letting the wive use it?", "Honestly the people who comment on this sub are usually teenagers.

I can say with certainty that if OPs wife can make it through school successfully and hold a high-stress job well, then she can learn to look before sitting. It's quite simple and easy for us ADHD folks to learn good habits and learn from our mistakes.\n\nEven while undiagnosed I was never this bad, and while I know individuality is exactly that, please don't think this woman is incapable of learning to look before sitting... because she is (maybe) ADHD. Trust me on that, I wear glasses and know how to care for them. I also know to look before I sit. \n\nWere she to sit on their sleeping kitty(if they had) I bet she would learn pretty quickly to never do it again; the assumption that she can't learn to look before she sits because she is easily distracted is like saying she's unable to adequately look before crossing the street everytime, when both of these are clearly false.\n\nGive us ADHD folks more credit than that, thanks.
