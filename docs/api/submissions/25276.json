I really made an effort not to just flop", "I do too. But, he knows her and her ways and it IS his computer. I wouldn't let anyone leave mine lying around. The ambiguity of the situation made me say N A H.", "Item, the one item. His computer. She\u2019s TA for this one incident where she sat on the computer that she left on the couch. Every other example is about OP leaving expensive things on seats or situations where the only person actually affected is the sitter herself.", "It's not criticism tho. OP was raging like a wild beast", "Interesting that you're condining verbal abuse.", "shit happens. like what are you going to accomplish by shouting at her when she's probably a lot vulnerable herself and is broken up about it? reddit just likes to do gotcha even if it's your own wife. that shit won't work. Also, she probably has undiagnosed ADHD or something.", "It's okay he is pissed. He just went overboard for me. \n\nAlso. If you buy a $3000 laptop and you are struggling financially, insure the thing. It can always break", "I'm not disputing that? It's still just a laptop.", "For not being mad over a laptop?

I knew a Yale graduate who was dumber than a box of rocks. Like I said, she's being careless and irresponsible and when you called her out on it, of course she doubled down saying that she's not wrong.\n\n This is what people like her do. If it were me, it would show me that she doesn't care about other people's things or how they feel. I totally understand why you finally lost it with her. It's causing you to be inconvenienced all the time and it gets frustrating.", "Good lord I hope she's not a surgeon.", "Cool she\u2019s book smarts. The most useless kind of smarts in the real world.", "clumsiness is not a personality trait and given the rather extreme consequences she's paid for this, I highly doubt that she's careless\n\nfrom your comments you've described someone who:\n- has poor proprioception\n- hyper focuses on things to the point of being unaware of her surroundings\n- actively focuses on other things while walking and moving about\n\nyou say you thought she had ADHD and took the TOVA\n\ndunno what other testing she had but the TOVA isn't supposed to be used as a singular diagnostic test and is less accurate for inattentive type ADHD than hyperactive type\n\na non diagnosis doesn't mean these things aren't an inherent part of how her brain works. at the end of the day a diagnosis is only for a few things - insurance, finding people like you and support, and understanding yourself\n\nwhether she qualifies for an ADHD diagnosis or not, instead of getting upset with her for it, you both should be working WITH her brain\n\nthe changing where you leave stuff part is great. it's a good first step\n\nbut in the comments you're shitting on her and acting like this is a choice. how could she not learn her lesson after the ant hill and the PTSD from that you ask? you grouse about it just being a basic survival skill. you call her careless\n\nokay that time you were tired and you forgot and sat on your glasses? try to imagine that your entire life is like that. that remembering to look takes momental effort every single time. that remembering where you left stuff takes ridiculous effort. that you have to actively concentrate heavily on items and your relation to them to not break things\n\nthese are background processes in your brain constantly running so of course it's obvious to you. but they aren't in her brain. and there is no way to make them be\n\nI don't know your wife but I'm guessing that she actually does put a lot of effort in and still just.... fails, constantly. because that's what life is like when you have to actively focus on a million tiny things that are repetitive - you drop the ball and drop the ball and drop the ball. and clearly this costs her dearly too - I can only imagine the number of her own items she's broken, not to mention the horror of sitting in puke, or on an ant hill\n\nnot to mention - do you really think you're the first person who has gotten mad at her for this? how often do you think she got in trouble growing up? if it seems like she doesn't care or is defensiveness - how do you think she got that way?\n\nI don't know your insurance, but your wife can probably see a psych or therapist who specialises in ADHD even without a diagnosis. and there's tonnes of info about ADHD that's accessible without a diagnosis", "Good, that means she'll have the money to replace it.", "Being clumsy does not mean she cannot learn. I, too, am clumsy (mainly because I am always in a hurry). I will have random bruises and not know when I got them because I run into things so much.  However, I am not clumsy to the point where I break property, sit in vomit, etc.  She can learn; she just doesn't think the request is important enough for which to make an effort.", "She can\u2019t even do something as simple as looking before she sits. I\u2019d want her as far as possible from the operating table.", "Yep. Puke is a bodily fluid and can transmit communicable diseases. That's really gross anyway. How could she do that and still not learn her lesson? This is why I concluded that she just doesn't care. That and all the other times like sitting in the ant pile, etc. She just doesn't care how it's inconveniencing other people.", "Then the people with jobs showed up.", "Is it an overreaction? Yes\nIs the overreaction justified? Also yes", "Sounds justified", "You clearly did not read it (or failed to comprehend) correctly. SHE put the macbook on the couch.", ">and it IS his computer\n\nI mean it's her rear end.", "Addressed in another comment - she does not have ADHD.\n\nI don't think shouting is about accomplishing something, but more about expressing an emotion (anger).

I'm just trying to clarify that this is not an intelligence issue, but a carelessness and clumsiness issue.", "Imagine she sits on the heart she was supposed to give the patient", "She is a surgeon. Her clumsiness doesn't extend to that, though. She's actually rated at the top in her program for technique/clinical. She's also an amazing painter / artist. She's actually really good at things she can hyper focus on.", "Then it's not an overreaction.", "Not an overreaction actually. She\u2019s refusing to listen and do what she should be.", "Yeah, definitely. Like I said. I would be upset/bummed. I just don't understand the point of going crazy. It's not like she purposely threw it out of the window. She was a bit careless and it sucks for OP.", "I don't know who Mr Rogers is. I just don't get why you would get so furious over a replaceable thing. It's also not very wise he didn't insure the laptop, seeing how often the gf breaks stuff. Not saying it's his fault, obviously. But if my gf breaks my laptop, console, car or whatever, I would just be bummed a bit", "Sure. I honestly don't get the big issue here. My gf broke my PS4 years ago. She dropped it when we where moving. It's just a playstation, nothing that can't be replaced. \n\n\nAlso, we all broke stuff accidentally. I don't see the point in getting mad as hell over that.", "Sure but at this point I would be questioning whether it's an issue of her just not caring that you're being inconvenienced. Clearly she knows that this bothers you and she has continued to do it.", "It's a she doesn't respect or care about it issue. That's why she doesn't take note.", "Has your wife every been checked for neurodivergence? Your descriptions of her sound like NVLD. In which case her clumsiness and lack of attention is essentially caused by brain damage. \n\nIt can make pwNVLD feel horrible to have expectations placed on us that because we are smart we must be doing things like this on purpose or through a lack of trying OR to be called dumb for things like this like I'm seeing in other comments.", "Could be ADHD?", "What an interesting person. Still, she has no excuse for not checking where she sits. That's just on her", "She\u2019s a surgeon but replacing a MacBook screen is a financial burden?", "It was more than needed but I think it\u2019s justified none the less", "Exactly. Stuff like this is basic adult skills 101. It's also called how to be a decent person who cares about other people and their things besides yourself.", "OP said in another comment that it is insured through apple care but would likely cost $300 to fix. Sounds right because I had a laptop break before (my own fault) and definitely had to pay despite having apple care. \n\nSounds like you haven't ever had a gf if you think being bummed out is the natural reaction to conflict in a relationship.", "A once in a while freak accident should be forgiven, especially if care was taken and it just spontaneously *happened*. Like if she genuinely has no idea why it happened, they thought they had a perfect grip on it and that it was well within their comfortable carrying weight, they were watching where they're walking, and they're genuinely confused as to how the hell it managed to drop it. Or if it was because neither of you took the care to pack it up safely and it spilled out of a badly-balanced box or one whose tape gave way. Genuine freak accident, live and learn and forgive.\n\nIf you know you're a clumsy forgetful person who has a HISTORY of sitting absentmindedly, and you actively leave something somewhere you'll possibly sit and then DOUBLE DOWN on that mistake by managing to sit on it absentmindedly because you never check what you're sitting on? I'd be frustrated as hell too, that they haven't figured out a system or diagnosis to help them manage this behavior.\n\nHE specifically doesn't leave it or anything else out like this any more, to specifically avoid this situation. To him, I'm sure this feels very similar to her just pulling out a hammer and then whacking the screen on purpose, because WHO misses an entire laptop on a seat when THEY of all people should be able to notice and remember it's there because THEY left it there?", "Yeah no clue. It honestly inconveniences her way more than me (commented to someone else that the ant hill situation literally gave her some PTSD about ants).", ">Sounds like you haven't ever had a gf if you think being bummed out is the natural reaction to conflict in a relationship.\n\nMaybe you haven't been in a good relationship. I never fight with my gf, it's a waste of time. We have our disagreements, but being mad as OP is a sign of weakness for me. Maybe it's a cultural thing, who knows", "\n\n\n\n>WHO misses an entire laptop on a seat when THEY of all people should be able to notice and remember it's there because THEY left it there?\n\nPeople with ADD or ADHD.

It's a sign of two people who are scared to speak up for themselves. Anger (getting mad) is a normal human emotion, and pretending it is a sign of weakness just makes you sound stupid TBH. It's definitely not cultural."]}
