{"id": 15148, "submission_id": "12rfygy", "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to pay my dogs $1,500 vet bill?", "selftext": "So, some background: My roommate (f24) and I (m25) have been living together for 3 years now. We've had an extremely rocky go of it financially. We own a mobile home (in my name) and our lot rent is just $475 a month. Even at that measley payment there have been multiple months where I have had to cover her side of the rent. \n\nIn the past year my girlfriend (f27) has also moved in with us. We split bills now three ways and even so my roommate has still missed rent due to calling out or taking vacations from work. So needless to say, finances have been a stresser. \nThat brings us to the vet bill. \n\nYesterday me and my girlfriend were out from 11 am till 8 pm (not important but we were going to car dealerships all day). We leave my girlfriends two dogs in kennels anytime we are out so that they dont get into anything. I came home and my roommate had let the dogs out of their kennels. Though, not a big problem, we didnt ask our roommate to let out the dogs. I went about my usual and let my girlfriends dogs, plus my roommates one dog, outside. \n\nWhen I went to let them back inside i noticed that one of my girlfriends dogs (20 Ib jack russell) was wobbly and stumbling around. I noticed a baking pan on the ground and immediately put two and two together. My roommate has been making pot brownies the past two weeks. I immediately go to ask my roommate how many brownies were in the pan and she said all of them but one. Me and my girlfriend loaded her dogs into the car and took them to the emergency vet. I asked my roommate the recipe and how many mgs of thc were in them. she told me 200mg for the entire pan. \n\nThe vet looked them over and said they would be fine we just had to keep them hydrated and watch them for any signs of tremors. We took them home, gave them pedialyte and went to sleep for work in the morning. \n\nI woke up to my girlfriend screaming that one of the dogs (70 Ib german shepard) wasnt moving or breathing. I checked her and she was barely breathing. we rushed her back to the er vet and they told us it was obvious she had more than 200mg. It turned out the pan had between 800-1000mg. Our dog is currently at risk of heart failure and other dire problems.\n\nThey then brought in the bill for us to pay to leave her overnight. It was $1,300. Of course neither of us had that kind of money on hand so I opened a heath credit to be able to pay it. We let our roommate know she would be responsible for this bill. She said there was absolutely no way she would be paying the vet bill for someone elses dog and is blaming the dog for eating the food she left out on the counter. \n\nAt this point I am so frustrated with all the financial strain I dont know what to do. I believe she should pay the bill because she is the one who caused this.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit:\n1) Im not sure why so many people are tripped out about this but we dont live in a camper or a travel trailer, our mobile home is 3 bedrooms and has a backyard, which is where I let the dogs outside in the post.\n2) We do not normally kennel our dogs every day or for as long. When we kennel them, it is for their protection, not because they \"arent trained\" or \"act up\"\n3) Me and my girlfriend do not struggle financially.", "created_utc": 1681876619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rfygy/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_pay_my_dogs_1500/", "score": 482, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rule number one is keep that stuff far away from any children or animals who might innocently want some because it looks good. There is no reason she should be leaving a full pan of weed brownies outside on the ground of all places. On top of that, it was extra shitty that she lied to y'all about the dosage, it was a medical emergency and she should have been honest before it was a problem. If she had been honest in the first place they likely would have been able to pump their stomachs, get them on a saline line for a lil to get some fluids and then you might not have had this big ass bill for the overnight stay.\n\nAs an extra point, doctors and vets are not the cops, they really don't care if you've done drugs or have them in your system, they care about you not dying.

She can't be off leash with other dogs, but she walks with the pack so happily! And the most important ingredient has been consistency and love. Me, in other words. My wife loves her and vice versa, and Poundcake was amazing with my son when he was born six years ago and ever since. Tho we were worried! We paid big money for an expert to assess her before our son came home. They cleared her with flying colors. They were right. She is a gentle, beautiful girl.\n\nBut I am her person. Her constant. To an unnerving degree. The dog before her was a husky. I had her 16 full years. That's old for a husky. And she knew I was her person? But she didn't like to acknowledge that fact very overtly. She was her own girl, the most independent irrepressible spirit I ever met.My girl. My dog. She traversed four states with me and saw me through four love affairs, some of them more ill advised than others. She was an asshole. And also perfect. Technically, she needed me?

The way you need the person who prepared the food and dished it up for you four times a day that delivered you from 29 pounds and every one of your bones is exposed?

Some days I want to drop her back off at the pound. Sigh.\n\nAnd the very first time we left her at alone at home? We looked back up at the window as we walked toward the subway, and she had jumped on the dining room table and was staring back at us with concentration camp eyes. Terrified. Desperate. \n\nWe had been on our way out for a special anniversary dinner. We went home and got takeout. It was too much. That's when we got her a crate. And when we leave? She happily ambles into her crate and receives a cookie. There she would stay until we came home without anxiety. Without angst. She would stretch out and sip at her water and wait for us. We were rarely gone more than four hours between the two of us. She liked it and there. To this day she does. And sometimes when we were both out all day, she could stay in there up to nine hours. We rarely subjected her to that and she had a regular dog walker during the week. But if the  occasional weekend outing went long? She was solid. Her crate soothes her. Its her den. \n\nKeep talking smack about crate training, people.

I was just pointing out that it may vary by state", "Exactly. A long time ago (in a galaxy far far away) I worked as a vet assistant. Crate training is a great tool for anxious (and destructive!) dogs. We have used it for all our dogs but eventually they don\u2019t need it anymore. They still have the option to go in them on their own if they want to. We had a rescue German shepherd who tried to eat a mattress and another rescue who would drag her very large bed up and down the stairs while we were gone.
