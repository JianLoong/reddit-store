We've had an extremely rocky go of it financially. We own a mobile home (in my name) and our lot rent is just $475 a month. Even at that measley payment there have been multiple months where I have had to cover her side of the rent. \n\nIn the past year my girlfriend (f27) has also moved in with us. We split bills now three ways and even so my roommate has still missed rent due to calling out or taking vacations from work. So needless to say, finances have been a stresser. \nThat brings us to the vet bill. \n\nYesterday me and my girlfriend were out from 11 am till 8 pm (not important but we were going to car dealerships all day). We leave my girlfriends two dogs in kennels anytime we are out so that they dont get into anything. I came home and my roommate had let the dogs out of their kennels. Though, not a big problem, we didnt ask our roommate to let out the dogs. I went about my usual and let my girlfriends dogs, plus my roommates one dog, outside. \n\nWhen I went to let them back inside i noticed that one of my girlfriends dogs (20 Ib jack russell) was wobbly and stumbling around. I noticed a baking pan on the ground and immediately put two and two together. My roommate has been making pot brownies the past two weeks. I immediately go to ask my roommate how many brownies were in the pan and she said all of them but one. Me and my girlfriend loaded her dogs into the car and took them to the emergency vet. I asked my roommate the recipe and how many mgs of thc were in them. she told me 200mg for the entire pan. \n\nThe vet looked them over and said they would be fine we just had to keep them hydrated and watch them for any signs of tremors. We took them home, gave them pedialyte and went to sleep for work in the morning. \n\nI woke up to my girlfriend screaming that one of the dogs (70 Ib german shepard) wasnt moving or breathing. I checked her and she was barely breathing. we rushed her back to the er vet and they told us it was obvious she had more than 200mg. It turned out the pan had between 800-1000mg. Our dog is currently at risk of heart failure and other dire problems.\n\nThey then brought in the bill for us to pay to leave her overnight. It was $1,300. Of course neither of us had that kind of money on hand so I opened a heath credit to be able to pay it. We let our roommate know she would be responsible for this bill. She said there was absolutely no way she would be paying the vet bill for someone elses dog and is blaming the dog for eating the food she left out on the counter. \n\nAt this point I am so frustrated with all the financial strain I dont know what to do. I believe she should pay the bill because she is the one who caused this.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit:\n1) Im not sure why so many people are tripped out about this but we dont live in a camper or a travel trailer, our mobile home is 3 bedrooms and has a backyard, which is where I let the dogs outside in the post.\n2) We do not normally kennel our dogs every day or for as long. When we kennel them, it is for their protection, not because they \"arent trained\" or \"act up\"\n3) Me and my girlfriend do not struggle financially.", "created_utc": 1681876619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rfygy/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_pay_my_dogs_1500/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point, simply getting her to leave so that she stops putting your animals at risk is probably the best you can hope for.", "NTA.\n\nAside from that, why is she still living there? If she doesn't pay rent, and she was responsible for hurting my dogs so severely, I'd be handing over an eviction notice straight away. \n\nYou're struggling financially and she skips rent frequently, her being there isn't helping you.", "NTA. This is your roommate\u2019s fault every step of the way.

Take every bit of legal action you can.", "NTA\n\nThis was 100% on roommate.  \n\nThat said, I'd like to introduce you to a concept called \"judgement proof\".  It's when a lawyer knows they can win a judgement against someone, but they also know they have basically zero chance of ever collecting said judgement.  This is pretty much the situation you find yourself in:  Trying to collect $1500 from someone who has trouble paying their third of $475 rent is going to be... challenging.", "NTA.

How are you going to get that money?", "NTA. Your roommate should have the common sense not to leave food out if there is a possibility the dogs could get to it. This is absolutely on her - *she* let the dogs out of the kennels, so they were able to reach the brownies *she* made and left out. \n\nThe fact that she is also a dog owner makes her an even bigger AH (and irresponsible owner). She presumably knew that the food has ingredients harmful to dogs, and probably does know given that she lied about the amount of THC.\n\nEdit: wording", "You're NTA for asking her to pay it. Good luck getting her to pay it, however. You kept her on as a freeloader for so long that you must be aware of her limitations as a person who will pay you money she owes you. I think you should take her to small claims court over this. And get a judgment. Just so you have it and if she ever makes that much? You can get it from her. Good luck. Sorry about your puppies! I trust that all are recovering well. You've got to get rid of that roommate!

Isn't a Mobile Home the same as a Camper?", "I don't know. There's a whole lot to dislike here. I guess I'll lean to NTA since she let them out without permission. That being said, you're not getting any money out of her, so it doesn't really matter.", "ESH. Three dogs and three people in a mobile home is too many. You guys can barely afford your monthly payment, but you have dogs, which are expensive. I would also think 9 hours in a kennel is a long time for dogs? Yes she should be paying, but this situation doesn\u2019t sound great.", "NTA. And charge her for the bills, go to court and then evict her. If she can afford pot and vacations, she can pay you back.

I can\u2019t imagine the stress relief you\u2019d get with the roommate gone.", "Probably ESH... Are the dogs in large kennels that they can actually run in or are they in smaller crates? If the latter, then leaving them in crates for so long really isn't a good idea (or, you know, humane). However, that does NOT absolve your roommate from responsibility if she let the dogs out and didn't supervise them properly. She should be responsible for the vet bill.", "NTA.  Kick her out.  She's costing you more money than its worth.", "NTA, however you can kiss that money farewell because you will never see it again. \n\nYou need to get her out of your home like yesterday. Consider the $1500 the price to get her out of your life, and it\u2019ll be the best money you\u2019ve ever spent.", "NTA for the issue of her leaving out the pan for them to eat, or her not paying fees appropriately. \nHowever 9 hours is pushing the limits for dogs to be kenneled. No food or water for nine hours in the day? That's rough.", "You leave your dogs locked up for 11 hrs? \nYTA.", "She is not responsible for the vet bill. The dog ate her brownies. The dog, caused the dogs problem. All the dogs should know not to take food off the counter.  Also You are NTA.

You didn't leave the dog at a doggy daycare where if something happened that they would be somewhat responsible, that is if they didn't have you sign a waiver to go there.  \n\nYeah it's her fault that the dog got into them but you all are potheads and didn't see something like this coming?  Even if you are not,  you are allowing it to be in the house.  You expect her to be responsible while she is high?  You let her live there knowing she gets high so yeah, shit is going to happen.  Did you discuss with her if you care for my dogs against my wishes you will be responsible for any damage occured?  \n\nMy ex watches my dogs they got into some shit at his house and I had to pay for it.  He called the vet line that cost x amount of dollars without my knowledge and I paid for it even though that wasn't the route I would have chose to do, nor wanted him to do but I trust that he will do his best in the best interest of my dog.  We can't control how other people care for our pets, or our children we just have to chose who we feel will do the best for the best interest of our loved ones.", "I wouldn't pay for your ill trained dogs either.
