My fianc\u00e9, Josh (28M) and I (26F) have been together for 5 years, engaged for 3. He has a little brother, James (24M) who has been with his girlfriend Sally for 2 years. \n\nWe have a great relationship with my fianc\u00e9s brother and his girlfriend. We have been there for them during their rough patches and overall supportive of their relationship. Even though they live a 10+ hour drive away, we stay in touch weekly and sometimes daily. We visit them Atleast once a year and they have still never come to visit us but they live in a fun beach town so we never complain about a tropical weekend trip haha. Sent birthday gifts and Christmas gifts without getting anything in return but my love language is gift giving so as long as they were happy with their gifts, I was happy. They are doing great to the point James has a ring and plans to propose soon!\n\nA little backstory, a few years back we went to visit them and stayed in this beautiful hotel and wedding venue. We both fell in love but at the time there was no way we could afford it. \n\nBack to the main story, as you can tell, we got engaged pretty young and at the time we didn\u2019t feel ready to get married. Honestly, I\u2019m not big on weddings but my fianc\u00e9 wants one so we agreed on a smaller affair to celebrate. Since we decided to wait a few years, about 5 months ago we decided to take a shot at the venue we dreamed of and turns out we can afford it!! We can afford it on our own but both of our loving families are chipping in so we are totally within budget and over the moon. 5 years and we are FINALLY getting married! \n\nThis entire time we have been keeping Sally and James in the loop since it\u2019s in their home town. Asking for advice on vendors and just overall excited chatting about it. \n\nMonday last week, we locked down a date and just had to pay the $1,000 deposit by tomorrow. I held off to confirm the date was good with my family since my cousin has a wedding scheduled 3 weeks after ours. We planned to pay it today after I got the blessing.\n\nYesterday, my fianc\u00e9 got a phone call from his dad asking if he spoke to James recently. His dad further explains that James, who has no proposed to his girlfriend yet, decided to book the same venue THE WEEKEND BEFORE our wedding. \n\nTo say I\u2019m upset is an understatement. We have been talking to them for months about our progress. They had never once showed interest in the location. Frankly, I could care less that it\u2019s at the same place, the weekend before is just a slap in the face. I don\u2019t think I can bring myself to forgive them, let alone attend.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go to BILs wedding?\n\nEdit: only BIL and FSIL live in the town the venue is located in. It is a 5+ hour drive for the closest family member, everyone else is 10+ hours drive or flight away.

Maybe the father got confused over something James said. Maybe James booked it ahead of time for some other reason. Maybe James just thought \"Hey everyone will be in town, might as well get married\".\n\nIf James is planning to get married a week before your wedding then that is pretty rude. He should have talked to you about it first... He also should have probably talked to his possible future fiance first...\n\nNTA but you need to talk to the source, not play a game of telephone.", "NTA. Who books a venue when they aren\u2019t even engaged yet? Either way, go if you want or don\u2019t, just focus on your own wedding day. It doesn\u2019t really matter in the end if they\u2019re having theirs at the same place.", "You're NTA. It's a mind boggling move to book the weekend prior, knowing no one can attend both events, and knowing how much time and effort you have put into this. Sounds like you all laid the groundwork, and they're swooping right in now.\n\nI-n-f-o: are they in a race with the 9 month clock? What's the rush?", "NTA \n\nI wouldn't go and not interact with them, going forward. Will you be changing venues? Everything feels tainted, now........", "NTA \nThe only assholes here are your bil and his gf.\nHow ridiculous of them to do this.And u mentioned it was a destination wedding so your finances family could attend only one.They purposely did it.\n\nThe only thing is if you guys were getting cold responses like not visiting you or giving gifts no matter how small(idk how significant these are but since u felt to mention i guess it mattered to you) despite making efforts why didn't you realise something was off .I mean wasn't there any such probable hint that they weren't very fond of you guys or something because no family will intentionally do this .", "INFO: Do either of your family live in this town where the venue is located or is everyone traveling? Is it possible they chose that date/venue since fiance's family will be in town already?", "NTA. At all. BIL made a seriously AH move. I would *love* to know what his thought process was for that considering he can't be ignorant of the fact that it is basically a destination wedding for both of you.", "NTA and seems stupid to book the same venue if BIL hasn\u2019t even propped yet. I think I\u2019d ask fianc\u00e9 to have a conversation with his brother about it.", "Info:\n\nAre you worried people won't come to both? Is it because it's before yours and you want to be first with the location?", "NTA but before you do anything you should probably talk to them directly. My first thought when I read this was that this was a well intended but ultimately silly attempt to make everyone's life easier. Perhaps that's the optimist in me but I'd be curious to know if his justification is that this way everyone flying in can stay for the entire week. I understand financially and logistically that's probably not possible but is there a chance that your BIL is an idiot?", "NTA. With the dates being as they are, it's possible that not everyone will be able to attend both. Before you do anything else, talk to the couple. As it stands right now you're getting this info second hand. There's a lot of room for misunderstandings.", "> Monday last week, we locked down a date\n\nINFO: was your BIL aware of the date you chose?\n\nHis wedding is timed so that you have to travel for 10 hours *the weekend before your own wedding*, and then 10 hours *again* for your own wedding. You should point that out to him, because if you have a good relationship, he will surely see the problem and love his own date.\n\nDefinitely NTA for *not* wanting to travel long distance 2 weekends in a row, when you probably have a mountain of stuff to do - never mind any other reasons you might have for not wanting to go.", "NTA. \n\n*INFO: Why does it matter to you? Have people decided that they can only go to one or the other? Will this not make it easier for people travelling in?*", "INFO: have you actually spoken to BIL about this and why they made the choice? What did he say?", "NTA for your actual issue but destination weddings are an AH thing to impose on people unless you're paying for their travel expenses.", "I may get downvoted but YTA. You are still getting your wedding day with the venue you love and the people you want. No one is taking that away from you by getting married the weekend before do you boycotting a wedding simply because it\u2019s the weekend before yours means you are acting like a petty  asshole.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Monday last week, we locked down a date and just had to pay the $1,000 deposit by tomorrow. I held off to confirm the date was good with my family since my cousin has a wedding scheduled 3 weeks after ours. We planned to pay it today after I got the blessing. Yesterday, my fianc\u00e9 got a phone call from his dad asking if he spoke to James recently. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So BOTH OF YOU booked the venue AT THE SAME TIME for close to the same date. NO AHs here, just bad luck.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"I held off to confirm the date was good with my family \" .. and now you found out it wasn't. Where is the problem? Cancel your venue, and don't pay the deposit. Everything is fine.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBIL handled that very well, and polite: 4 weeks distance to the other known planned wedding (your cousins). So EVERYTHING IS FINE.", "So a few thoughts here, the first being, I think you're in panic mode especially given that BIL and GF aren't engaged yet and she may not even *want* to get married at that location, let alone on that timeline. You need to have a proper conversation with BIL and see how this all plays out. \n\nSecondly, while its understandably annoying, your wedding is *your* day. Not the weekend before, not the day before. Your BIL may have assumed that because people were coming into town anyways for your wedding that this would help cut down on travel for some guests. This may have been a good, if not naive, intention on his part.\n\nThird and finally, you really have to decide if this issue is going to be worth wrecking the entire relationship you have with BIL and FSIL. If you boycott that is a possible once in a lifetime experience you'll miss out on and one you can't recover. While what BIL has done is annoying and tactless, I don't think this is the hill worth sacrificing what you state is a meaningful relationship. \n\nI think YWBTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They knew the details along the way and WITHOUT an engagement on their end, decided to maliciously book the same venue a WEEK before OP\u2019s and her fianc\u00e9s wedding date, knowing it\u2019s destination. If that is not some sort of entitlement and selfishness to ruin OP\u2019s special day then I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m also baffled that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9s parents haven\u2019t berated BIL for what he has done. OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 should definitely let his family know what BIL has done immediately. This is where fianc\u00e9 needs to speak with his father again to gain confirmation and then speak with his brother, with someone else present to ensure that no lying and twisting of the narrative happens. \n\nOP- you have decisions to make. You can decide to still continue on with the wedding. You just need answers from your fianc\u00e9s family on which wedding they will be attending, which will be messy and cause additional drama, if they can only afford to attend one. Or if it isn\u2019t too late pick another venue and change the date. I would not invite BIL and FSIL or attend their wedding.

Like bought Sally and James a $500k house on a whim, rich. Apparently James went to go ask for her hand in marriage and the in-laws immediately started getting excited. I\u2019m not sure when they started planning but Sally is for lack of a better term high maintenance and there\u2019s no way she would have just gone with a wedding venue without completely being onboard. They just have the money to throw at it and are paying for the whole thing Vs. Us having to budget. \n\nI just feel blindsided. Like I said in my post, I could care less that it\u2019s the same venue. Just picking the weekend before is shitty without as much as giving us a heads up. We talk to them constantly and they haven\u2019t even mentioned wanting to look at that venue or a wedding at all.", "Everyone is traveling. There\u2019s no way they could attend both.", "OP edited it, says it's becouse people probably won't attend both weddings, since it's 5-10 hours long drive for everyone.", "Yes he was aware of the date the same day we booked.

It's not like they are flying to a remote country. The place is within driving distance.\n\nWith people spread out all over it is practically guaranteed that some people are going to need to drive/fly a ways to get to a wedding. Not everyone lives in the same city as their relatives/friends.", "OP stated that family and friends will be travelling as it\u2019s a destination wedding. Meaning family probably won\u2019t be able to stay for both. Leaving family to choose.", "Well the problem is, that the destination is 5-10 hours away from the rest of the family. How many of them would do 5-10 hours ride there and than back 2 weekends in a row? So yes, they are taking away the venue with people they love.", "No non, the brother in law booked the same venue for his wedding without being engaged and picked the WEEK END BEFORE OP's wedding. Making him the AH.", "It seems a bit naive to assume the BIL just *happened* to choose the same venue for a week before the OP's wedding, and just forget to tell the OP or his Brother.\n\nMaybe it was with good intentions like you suggest (although the OP's edits make that very unlikely) but even then he was extremely thoughtless not to mention his plans to the OP.\n\nAside from the travel conflict the BIL's decision can easily impact the OPs wedding in other ways\n\nFirst of all weddings can take a lot of prep and set up, especially in the week before. The BIL's decision essentially doubles this load for family members who would be involved in both. The MIL, for example, might need to write two speeches in a row, *and* make them feel unique and special for each brother.\n\nSecond of all people get tired and bored. When you show up for a wedding it can be really exciting seeing all the people and getting pumped about the ceremony. It is a festival, and that festive energy is part of what makes the event fun. But if every day is a festival then it stops being special. It will be less exciting the second weekend when you are seeing the same people and a similar ceremony all in the same place. \n\nLastly having the weddings in such close proximity, especially in the same place is really inviting comparison between the two. Nobody wants their wedding to feel like a competition.", ">4 weeks from the aleady planned wedding\n\nIt's the weekend *before* OP's wedding...", "Theres a few things to do. They all involve lying but might not be the worst. I don't think you'll actually have to move the date if I'm right\n\n1) Tell your BIL that for unforeseen circumstances that you had to cancel and see what happens. Then act accordingly but keep him far out of the loop until the month before \n\n2) Tell him you're moving the date \"So as not to interfere with their plans\" then see what happens. \n\n3) Lie and say you're moving date/venue to something even more expensive for shits and giggles and see what happens.\n\nIn reality do nothing of the sort. Keep the date and the people who can/want to come after you explain what happened are the people you keep talking to.", "But it seems unbelievable that they would choose the weekend before your wedding no matter what the venue is .Even if it was different location (probably a destination wedding since she is high maintenance) even then could your finances parents and most other common family attend both? If yes then I guess they weren't wrong.But if no how was it not intentional? \n Pretty sure they know how pathetic of them to do this...as they didn't even have guts to say this to u directly instead did it via someone else.\n\nSeems like Sally makes the call.And ur BIL has to agree as her parents are the one paying for everything even their house.", "It sounds like this only just happened.
