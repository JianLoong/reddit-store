He has a little brother, James (24M) who has been with his girlfriend Sally for 2 years. \n\nWe have a great relationship with my fianc\u00e9s brother and his girlfriend. We have been there for them during their rough patches and overall supportive of their relationship. Even though they live a 10+ hour drive away, we stay in touch weekly and sometimes daily. We visit them Atleast once a year and they have still never come to visit us but they live in a fun beach town so we never complain about a tropical weekend trip haha. Sent birthday gifts and Christmas gifts without getting anything in return but my love language is gift giving so as long as they were happy with their gifts, I was happy. They are doing great to the point James has a ring and plans to propose soon!\n\nA little backstory, a few years back we went to visit them and stayed in this beautiful hotel and wedding venue. We both fell in love but at the time there was no way we could afford it. \n\nBack to the main story, as you can tell, we got engaged pretty young and at the time we didn\u2019t feel ready to get married.

We planned to pay it today after I got the blessing.\n\nYesterday, my fianc\u00e9 got a phone call from his dad asking if he spoke to James recently. His dad further explains that James, who has no proposed to his girlfriend yet, decided to book the same venue THE WEEKEND BEFORE our wedding. \n\nTo say I\u2019m upset is an understatement. We have been talking to them for months about our progress. They had never once showed interest in the location. Frankly, I could care less that it\u2019s at the same place, the weekend before is just a slap in the face. I don\u2019t think I can bring myself to forgive them, let alone attend.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go to BILs wedding?\n\nEdit: only BIL and FSIL live in the town the venue is located in.

Maybe the father got confused over something James said. Maybe James booked it ahead of time for some other reason. Maybe James just thought \"Hey everyone will be in town, might as well get married\".\n\nIf James is planning to get married a week before your wedding then that is pretty rude. He should have talked to you about it first... He also should have probably talked to his possible future fiance first...\n\nNTA but you need to talk to the source, not play a game of telephone.", "NTA. Who books a venue when they aren\u2019t even engaged yet? Either way, go if you want or don\u2019t, just focus on your own wedding day.

Is it possible they chose that date/venue since fiance's family will be in town already?", "NTA. At all. BIL made a seriously AH move. I would *love* to know what his thought process was for that considering he can't be ignorant of the fact that it is basically a destination wedding for both of you.", "NTA and seems stupid to book the same venue if BIL hasn\u2019t even propped yet. I think I\u2019d ask fianc\u00e9 to have a conversation with his brother about it.", "Info:\n\nAre you worried people won't come to both? Is it because it's before yours and you want to be first with the location?", "NTA but before you do anything you should probably talk to them directly. My first thought when I read this was that this was a well intended but ultimately silly attempt to make everyone's life easier. Perhaps that's the optimist in me but I'd be curious to know if his justification is that this way everyone flying in can stay for the entire week. I understand financially and logistically that's probably not possible but is there a chance that your BIL is an idiot?", "NTA. With the dates being as they are, it's possible that not everyone will be able to attend both. Before you do anything else, talk to the couple. As it stands right now you're getting this info second hand. There's a lot of room for misunderstandings.", "> Monday last week, we locked down a date\n\nINFO: was your BIL aware of the date you chose?\n\nHis wedding is timed so that you have to travel for 10 hours *the weekend before your own wedding*, and then 10 hours *again* for your own wedding. You should point that out to him, because if you have a good relationship, he will surely see the problem and love his own date.\n\nDefinitely NTA for *not* wanting to travel long distance 2 weekends in a row, when you probably have a mountain of stuff to do - never mind any other reasons you might have for not wanting to go.", "NTA. \n\n*INFO: Why does it matter to you? Have people decided that they can only go to one or the other? Will this not make it easier for people travelling in?*", "INFO: have you actually spoken to BIL about this and why they made the choice? What did he say?", "NTA for your actual issue but destination weddings are an AH thing to impose on people unless you're paying for their travel expenses.", "I may get downvoted but YTA. You are still getting your wedding day with the venue you love and the people you want. No one is taking that away from you by getting married the weekend before do you boycotting a wedding simply because it\u2019s the weekend before yours means you are acting like a petty  asshole.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Monday last week, we locked down a date and just had to pay the $1,000 deposit by tomorrow.

Everything is fine.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBIL handled that very well, and polite: 4 weeks distance to the other known planned wedding (your cousins). So EVERYTHING IS FINE.", "So a few thoughts here, the first being, I think you're in panic mode especially given that BIL and GF aren't engaged yet and she may not even *want* to get married at that location, let alone on that timeline. You need to have a proper conversation with BIL and see how this all plays out. \n\nSecondly, while its understandably annoying, your wedding is *your* day. Not the weekend before, not the day before. Your BIL may have assumed that because people were coming into town anyways for your wedding that this would help cut down on travel for some guests. This may have been a good, if not naive, intention on his part.\n\nThird and finally, you really have to decide if this issue is going to be worth wrecking the entire relationship you have with BIL and FSIL. If you boycott that is a possible once in a lifetime experience you'll miss out on and one you can't recover. While what BIL has done is annoying and tactless, I don't think this is the hill worth sacrificing what you state is a meaningful relationship. \n\nI think YWBTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can decide to still continue on with the wedding. You just need answers from your fianc\u00e9s family on which wedding they will be attending, which will be messy and cause additional drama, if they can only afford to attend one.

The BIL's decision essentially doubles this load for family members who would be involved in both. The MIL, for example, might need to write two speeches in a row, *and* make them feel unique and special for each brother.\n\nSecond of all people get tired and bored. When you show up for a wedding it can be really exciting seeing all the people and getting pumped about the ceremony. It is a festival, and that festive energy is part of what makes the event fun. But if every day is a festival then it stops being special. It will be less exciting the second weekend when you are seeing the same people and a similar ceremony all in the same place. \n\nLastly having the weddings in such close proximity, especially in the same place is really inviting comparison between the two. Nobody wants their wedding to feel like a competition.", ">4 weeks from the aleady planned wedding\n\nIt's the weekend *before* OP's wedding...", "Theres a few things to do. They all involve lying but might not be the worst.

Then act accordingly but keep him far out of the loop until the month before \n\n2) Tell him you're moving the date \"So as not to interfere with their plans\" then see what happens. \n\n3) Lie and say you're moving date/venue to something even more expensive for shits and giggles and see what happens.\n\nIn reality do nothing of the sort.

Also, you basically saved the date - do you know what his parents will do in terms of which wedding to attend since they have known your date much longer?", "NTA\nIt is a crappy thing to do to you, but James is also an AH to his girlfriend who he hasn\u2019t even proposed to, but has now booked a venue on his own, without her input, in just a few months.\n\nI hope she turns him down. What a selfish oaf.\n\nBut please do talk to him and get the facts from him.", "NTA\n\n> James, who has no proposed to his girlfriend yet, decided to book the same venue THE WEEKEND BEFORE our wedding.\n\nWTF?\n\nIs James pulling some kind of badly concieved prank?\n\nDoes he think people will be able to stay an entire week to make both weddings?\n\nI\u2019d be pissed.\n\nAlso the weekend before I\u2019d be busy anyway.\n\nBut the real hurt is going to be after all your careful planning, people will have to choose - and someone is going to lose. Setting people up for that makes James an asshole.", "NTA and don\u2019t give them anything else", "Sorry but they have always been TA. They never ever sent u a birthday gift or Christmas gift. They never made the effort to visit you. They really just took from you and I\u2019m having a hard time trying to figure out what you got in return from your post. you are most certainly NTA but I think you should re-examine your friendship", "NTA", "I\u2019m going with NTA - don\u2019t know what the issue is but sounds like a case of one upmanship. I think your hubby needs to talk to his brother.", "I did this actually. We knew we were getting married and when because we started discussing it when we went ring shopping. So I had actually booked the venue to make sure we got what we wanted (he was on the same page) before he officially proposed. When you discuss getting married and what ring you want, the actual proposal is only a formality.", "I dont think it\u2019s the fact that they booked around the same time but it\u2019s just so deliberate. The BIL hasn\u2019t even proposed; he chose the EXACT venue he knew OP worked hard to get, and then picked a date right before OPs. I know you don\u2019t exactly get a wide variety of dates to choose from with in demand venues but there\u2019s no reason they couldn\u2019t have asked for some time not the weekend before.", "Nope. BIL hasn't even proposed yet to his gf. He took the information he was being told by OP, including the venue, price, dates, etc and then booked his wedding the weekend before OP had booked his. Hell, BIL doesn't even know if GF will say yes and he went ahead and booked his \"wedding\" just to upstage OP it seems.", "No, an engagement isn't necessary and BIL doesn't necessarily have to propose or *be engaged* to Sally, but Sally should at least know that's she's getting married, right? From the OP it sounds like BIL has booked the venue without input from anyone *including his girlfriend*.", "> But it seems unbelievable that they would choose the weekend before your wedding no matter what the venue is\n\nIf was at best poor planning and at worst outright malicious.\n\nJust got married myself earlier this year and one of the things we did was choose a date around the important dates of people we wanted there the most as much as possible. We did our best to avoid birthdays, anniversaries and other life events. If we even got a whiff of something might be happening for them, we looked for other dates because we didn't want to make them choose us over anything else important if we could help it and risk them not being there.\n\nBIL didn't do that at all and you would think if he was much more in the loop about the general time frame of when the wedding was going down, he would make sure to ask for a specific date from them or just move it to another season when he knows for sure they aren't planning the wedding. Not doing so just about guarantees a whole lot of potential problems or just makes things more of a hassle for any guests that would potentially be going to both weddings.\n\nAs it stands now, I doubt OP *can* even attend without at least some great effort that comes with a lot of sacrifices because you don't have much time leading up to your own wedding. Attending one a week after your own would be tough for most people so BIL made attending OP's wedding harder than it needed to be.\n\nIts why I say at best, BIL is a poor planner and maybe inconsiderate.", "Do you expect him to surprise his partner there?", "You don't need to make a big deal out of the proposal, but you still have to have some conversation along the lines of \"Hey, do you have any interest in the two of us getting married? You do? Great, let's do that then!\", and that's still a proposal.", "> OP just fixed the date, and found out that BIL had fixed his wedding a week before.\n\nWithout knowing if his partner will even be up for getting married yet.....\n\nOP says this:\n\n> Since we decided to wait a few years, about 5 months ago we decided to take a shot at the venue we dreamed of and turns out we can afford it!! We can afford it on our own but both of our loving families are chipping in so we are totally within budget and over the moon. 5 years and we are FINALLY getting married!\n\n> This entire time we have been keeping Sally and James in the loop since it\u2019s in their home town. Asking for advice on vendors and just overall excited chatting about it.\n\nBIL has known about all the details the last 5 months as they planned it out.", "Always check the username when a comment just seems out of place.\n\nAdjective_NounNumber\n\nI've just been assuming every one of those I see is a bot. Almost every time I see a comment that doesn't make sense, or is outrageous, or deliberately contradictory, 9/10 have followed this naming pattern.\n\nStart keeping your eyes peeled for it, and it will jump out at you."]}
