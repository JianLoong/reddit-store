My fianc\u00e9, Josh (28M) and I (26F) have been together for 5 years, engaged for 3. He has a little brother, James (24M) who has been with his girlfriend Sally for 2 years. \n\nWe have a great relationship with my fianc\u00e9s brother and his girlfriend. We have been there for them during their rough patches and overall supportive of their relationship. Even though they live a 10+ hour drive away, we stay in touch weekly and sometimes daily. We visit them Atleast once a year and they have still never come to visit us but they live in a fun beach town so we never complain about a tropical weekend trip haha. Sent birthday gifts and Christmas gifts without getting anything in return but my love language is gift giving so as long as they were happy with their gifts, I was happy. They are doing great to the point James has a ring and plans to propose soon!\n\nA little backstory, a few years back we went to visit them and stayed in this beautiful hotel and wedding venue. We both fell in love but at the time there was no way we could afford it. \n\nBack to the main story, as you can tell, we got engaged pretty young and at the time we didn\u2019t feel ready to get married.

We planned to pay it today after I got the blessing.\n\nYesterday, my fianc\u00e9 got a phone call from his dad asking if he spoke to James recently. His dad further explains that James, who has no proposed to his girlfriend yet, decided to book the same venue THE WEEKEND BEFORE our wedding. \n\nTo say I\u2019m upset is an understatement. We have been talking to them for months about our progress. They had never once showed interest in the location. Frankly, I could care less that it\u2019s at the same place, the weekend before is just a slap in the face. I don\u2019t think I can bring myself to forgive them, let alone attend.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go to BILs wedding?\n\nEdit: only BIL and FSIL live in the town the venue is located in.

Maybe the father got confused over something James said. Maybe James booked it ahead of time for some other reason. Maybe James just thought \"Hey everyone will be in town, might as well get married\".\n\nIf James is planning to get married a week before your wedding then that is pretty rude. He should have talked to you about it first... He also should have probably talked to his possible future fiance first...\n\nNTA but you need to talk to the source, not play a game of telephone.", "NTA. Who books a venue when they aren\u2019t even engaged yet? Either way, go if you want or don\u2019t, just focus on your own wedding day.

Is it possible they chose that date/venue since fiance's family will be in town already?", "NTA. At all. BIL made a seriously AH move. I would *love* to know what his thought process was for that considering he can't be ignorant of the fact that it is basically a destination wedding for both of you.", "NTA and seems stupid to book the same venue if BIL hasn\u2019t even propped yet. I think I\u2019d ask fianc\u00e9 to have a conversation with his brother about it.", "Info:\n\nAre you worried people won't come to both? Is it because it's before yours and you want to be first with the location?", "NTA but before you do anything you should probably talk to them directly. My first thought when I read this was that this was a well intended but ultimately silly attempt to make everyone's life easier. Perhaps that's the optimist in me but I'd be curious to know if his justification is that this way everyone flying in can stay for the entire week. I understand financially and logistically that's probably not possible but is there a chance that your BIL is an idiot?", "NTA. With the dates being as they are, it's possible that not everyone will be able to attend both. Before you do anything else, talk to the couple. As it stands right now you're getting this info second hand. There's a lot of room for misunderstandings.", "> Monday last week, we locked down a date\n\nINFO: was your BIL aware of the date you chose?\n\nHis wedding is timed so that you have to travel for 10 hours *the weekend before your own wedding*, and then 10 hours *again* for your own wedding. You should point that out to him, because if you have a good relationship, he will surely see the problem and love his own date.\n\nDefinitely NTA for *not* wanting to travel long distance 2 weekends in a row, when you probably have a mountain of stuff to do - never mind any other reasons you might have for not wanting to go.", "NTA. \n\n*INFO: Why does it matter to you? Have people decided that they can only go to one or the other? Will this not make it easier for people travelling in?*", "INFO: have you actually spoken to BIL about this and why they made the choice? What did he say?", "NTA for your actual issue but destination weddings are an AH thing to impose on people unless you're paying for their travel expenses.", "I may get downvoted but YTA. You are still getting your wedding day with the venue you love and the people you want. No one is taking that away from you by getting married the weekend before do you boycotting a wedding simply because it\u2019s the weekend before yours means you are acting like a petty  asshole.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Monday last week, we locked down a date and just had to pay the $1,000 deposit by tomorrow.

Everything is fine.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBIL handled that very well, and polite: 4 weeks distance to the other known planned wedding (your cousins). So EVERYTHING IS FINE.", "So a few thoughts here, the first being, I think you're in panic mode especially given that BIL and GF aren't engaged yet and she may not even *want* to get married at that location, let alone on that timeline. You need to have a proper conversation with BIL and see how this all plays out. \n\nSecondly, while its understandably annoying, your wedding is *your* day. Not the weekend before, not the day before. Your BIL may have assumed that because people were coming into town anyways for your wedding that this would help cut down on travel for some guests. This may have been a good, if not naive, intention on his part.\n\nThird and finally, you really have to decide if this issue is going to be worth wrecking the entire relationship you have with BIL and FSIL. If you boycott that is a possible once in a lifetime experience you'll miss out on and one you can't recover. While what BIL has done is annoying and tactless, I don't think this is the hill worth sacrificing what you state is a meaningful relationship. \n\nI think YWBTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is where fianc\u00e9 needs to speak with his father again to gain confirmation and then speak with his brother, with someone else present to ensure that no lying and twisting of the narrative happens. \n\nOP- you have decisions to make. You can decide to still continue on with the wedding. You just need answers from your fianc\u00e9s family on which wedding they will be attending, which will be messy and cause additional drama, if they can only afford to attend one.

The BIL's decision essentially doubles this load for family members who would be involved in both. The MIL, for example, might need to write two speeches in a row, *and* make them feel unique and special for each brother.\n\nSecond of all people get tired and bored. When you show up for a wedding it can be really exciting seeing all the people and getting pumped about the ceremony. It is a festival, and that festive energy is part of what makes the event fun. But if every day is a festival then it stops being special. It will be less exciting the second weekend when you are seeing the same people and a similar ceremony all in the same place. \n\nLastly having the weddings in such close proximity, especially in the same place is really inviting comparison between the two. Nobody wants their wedding to feel like a competition.", ">4 weeks from the aleady planned wedding\n\nIt's the weekend *before* OP's wedding...", "Theres a few things to do. They all involve lying but might not be the worst.

Then act accordingly but keep him far out of the loop until the month before \n\n2) Tell him you're moving the date \"So as not to interfere with their plans\" then see what happens. \n\n3) Lie and say you're moving date/venue to something even more expensive for shits and giggles and see what happens.\n\nIn reality do nothing of the sort.

These people were suppose to be good friends. I hope OP can explain what they've done to all invitees and hope to count on their support. \n\nIf you push me far enough, petty is getting off easy. OP, I propose you attend the other wedding in a shiny white wedding dress (not your actual dress) Then grab the microphone and announce your pregnancy. Twins! I might even pay a woman to show up and pretend to be the side piece and make a scene.\n\n*shrugs* a girl can dream...but I have a feeling you'll take the high road. Class vs trash. Your wedding will put theirs to shame.", "NTA You're the couple that's engaged. Get the save the dates out ASAP and then when he finally does propose only crappy family members will bail to go to his instead. Most will go to the wedding they RSVPed to first.", "Change your venue to somewhere close to home and the week before BIL, then put him on an information diet.  One of them seems determined to undermine your plans.", "NTA. I'm guessing their side of this is that they feel entitled to the venue because it's in the town they live in and perhaps feel that you 'stole' it from them? Maybe they don't want everyone coming to 'their' town for 'your' wedding because they feel their event would then be less special or they'll have to take on some hosting/planning duties?\n\nThey're definitely TAs, to be clear, especially for not communicating at all about this and choosing the path of most drama. I wonder if they're just trying to force you to pick a new venue and may not even keep the date they booked once it's too late for you to change back.", "And they\u2019re now avoiding contact? There is your proof they knew exactly what they were doing. Otherwise they\u2019d be on their knees apologising for not thinking straight and trying to resolve the issue. \n\nIf I were you, now book the venue the weekend before theirs. Two can play at that game, right?", "Book the venue, send out the invites, be nice to folks that can't afford to attend both, RSVP no on theirs once they send out invites since you'll be too busy with preparing for your wedding. Then never visit them again.", "So send your RSVPs out as soon as you can. You are the couple that's actually engaged. Most (decent) people will go to the event they committed to first. They aren't engaged yet, so any \"notice\" they give people is completely informal.", "I mean I think you can know you're getting married to someone without being engaged.\n\nYou know how everyone says that you should know the answer before you propose? So are you engaged if you've discussed that you both want to get married but want a formal proposal?", "I really don\u2019t care about this hill you all seem to be fighting on. But generally speaking, most couples have already discussed their future plans when it comes to marriage. The proposal in most cases, IMO, is essentially a \u201cformality\u201d. Very few couples are going into a proposal blind or completely blind. \n\nThis just seems like a relevant piece of information for this topic you all are having.", "I'm intrigued. Tell me more about this wedding sack.", "Apparently it can't be changed once it has been \"finalized\". To get a new username you'd need to create a new account. \u2639\ufe0f", "Funny, huh? The best thing about this particular theory is no one can convince me otherwise, because the bots are already pretty sophisticated. Enough to make believable comments regularly.\n\nEvery one of these other replies might as well be bot comments too, haha!", "Are you talking about a wedding weekend type of thing? It still doesn\u2019t compare to the actual marriage, and having contentious relationships within the family because of hurt feelings over a wedding day  or in this case two wedding days . And im talking about the guests invite to the weddings. They have to deal with financial  costs as guests. The wedding gift, a lot of weddings involve cash gifts the day of the wedding. If it\u2019s a child free wedding, guest might have to pay babysitters. And if a destination wedding is one of the weddings, guest have travel costs, hotel cost and possibly childcare costs", "SIL\u2019s parents sound like the type who won\u2019t want their Princess to be married at the same venue a peasant is getting married at!! Make sure her parents know about this.", "NTA", "Looks like BIL has some hidden jealousy for his brother or your relationship. This is just not on. This is vindictive and slimey. Bil gives me the chills.  Op he knew what he was doing. Why else did he not tell you both that they booked the venue a week before your wedding, and he has never even proposed! Your Fil had to drop a hint because Bil wasn't going to say anything until the last minute. I would find somewhere else because what else is he going to do to ruin your wedding day. Look closer at Bil girlfriend to I bet she's behind this as well. NTA", "NTA . You BIL on the other hand", "NTA. They're takers. Vampires. Users. You give presents, never receive any? YOU stay in touch? YOU go to visit? Cut all contact. They ate NOT your friends. This last stunt proves it beyond a doubt.", "Why would they shoot themselves in the foot like that?\n\nNTA", "It sounds like there's travel involved for the families no matter where OP has her wedding. It's not like her fiance's whole family lives in one town except the BIL. So they may still only be able to attend 1", "It does suggest you haven't read the post that carefully. Or the comments replying to you, as this isn't the first time you've been corrected on OP's gender.", "Edit: only BIL and FSIL live in the town the venue is located in. It is a 5+ hour drive for the closest family member, everyone else is 10+ hours drive or flight away. There would be no way to attend both.\n\nit\u2019s a destination for all invited (flight or 5+ hours of driving). My fianc\u00e9s family will now have to choose which they will attend now. His immediate family is small with limited vacation time so there\u2019s no way they could swing both.\n\nThis is the problem", "Edit: only BIL and FSIL live in the town the venue is located in.

I've made peace with being an Active Persimmon though! The number annoys me a bit, tbh, I wish I could change it...", "As someone who also just took the default reddit name, I feel personally attacked \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
