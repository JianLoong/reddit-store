We live with our mom, who is divorced.\n\nThe thing thats been going on is that I can't focus on my studies, (graduating this year) I haven't been able to invite my bf over, all because of Nia's and Matt's treatment towards me or my boyfriend. When I study, I use our PC that's in my siblings room. (I have my classes, homeworks and books online or downloaded.) But for months, I wasn't able to study on weekends for more than a hour without being interrupted by Matt, Nia and my brother screaming, shouting, arguing, drinking or smoking in the back. Matt is always buying cigs, or alcohol to my siblings, which should be pretty illegal, however my mom decides to not care, because \"she argues enough with them and gets no result\". Eventually, my sister got addicted to cigarettes, throws a fit when she can't get it.\nWhen I'm studying, I ask them to lower the volume of their music, TV, or just go outside. Their answer to this is that \"i can go someone else's house\", and \"its their room so they do what they want\". I told them that we could solve this if we moved the PC to my room, which caused my siblings to throw a fit, because they need it. I told them they can still play on it when I'm not using it, Nia argued that she also needs it to study. (She frequently skips school to stay with Matt, doesn't plan to graduate). \n\nI told my mom that it's impossible for me to study in these conditions, and she said I can just study in my room without the computer. I told her that my stuff is online and she didn't believe me. I also told her that she better not expect me to get into a top university and graduate perfectly, if she can't tell my sister that Matt can't come over for a FEW weekends. She called me an AH for being selfish, and not letting my sister be with Matt, and it's my fault for not studying harder and using the computer for videogames. (I play when I'm finished, or unable to keep studying).\nI mentioned to her that Matt literally picks on my boyfriend everytime he comes over (calls him a f*g, comments on his looks), and that's why my boyfriend never comes over. She said it's not her problem, and if my boyfriend can't get over \"such childish comments\", then he shouldn't be in our family. \n\nAlso, I wanted to host a Halloween party at home, but my mom refused because Nia needed to rest from school. But Nia and Matt are hosting parties every second weekend? When I argued about this, she called me selfish for not letting Nia live a calm life.\nI live in a dorm on weekdays, and today my teacher approached me because I looked upset. I told her this. She said that tomorrow she'll call my mom if she won't provide me a chance to study, changes something about Matts or Nias behavior, she MIGHT contact authorities. \nI'm already scared of my mom's reaction, and I do feel like an AH here for telling an outsider about what's happening. \nSo, am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1670268669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdgvrq/aita_for_telling_my_teacher_about_whats_going_on/", "score": 273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly your mother allowing them to smoke and drink out back at 17,14,13 is not legal at least in my country, saying that you\u2019re being selfish when it seems you\u2019re the only one trying to apply themselves and you keep trying to fight through\u2026 is annoying and shouldn\u2019t be happening. \n\nYour mother is clearly picking favorites, is clearly passing you off (I assume your the oldest and as she is divorced just expects you to deal with it and handle it as she has which is not ok) and then gaslights you into how it\u2019s your fault. This is sadly neglect and abuse and not ok ever. \n\nAlso to allow your sisters bf over and be permitted to degrade your bf and you to be chastised for it is insane.

It's hard to see a situation when you're on the inside of it, but you deserve peace more than they deserve to party. Because EVERYONE deserves peace first and foremost. If you can't think in your own home, that isn't okay. It's good that your teacher is invested! I definitely think she should have approached it with more care, though.\n\nIf your mother isn't stopping them, though, the sad truth is that she isn't going to stop you. So it's okay to fight for what you need and set boundaries. You aren't doing anything wrong.", "NTA. Clearly your mother had decided to take the path of least resistance, and she tries to justify that decision to herself every time you try to push back.

Staying with your mum won't given them that life.", "You are NTA for telling a teacher. You will not be the asshole if your teacher has to report some aspect of your living situation to the authorities. You will not be the asshole if you and your siblings are removed from your mother\u2019s care. Got that? \n\nThis situation is bad. It is not your fault. You are doing your best. Your mom needs to step up regarding your siblings\u2019 behavior and it is unlikely she will do so, based on past performance. \n\nI hate to say it, but do not let the animals be the only reason you stay. Rehoming them elsewhere would be kinder to them if you were to leave to live at your dad\u2019s, and you should go live with your dad if he is willing to have you.", "NTA and neither is your teacher. Would you be more comfortable if you asked your teacher to speak with your dad?", "NTA. First, I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this. It breaks my heart when I see other children have to deal with these situations. OP, I grew up in a similar situation as 2nd oldest of family of 6. My eldest sister finished HS/started college by living with a close friend and that family. I was able to get out because I started working when I was 14 and never stopped. By 17, I was a clerk (basically cleaned and filed paperwork) at an insurance office and moved up to receptionist. Then studied and got my insurance licenses to be able to support and sell insurance at the office. This is all while living in a similar chaotic household, studying for high school exams/state exams, applying to college, studying for the SAT/ACT. With the promotions at the insurance gig, I was able to move out at 18 (splitting rent with a shitty roommate - still better than my abusive and wild family). I can give you several more ways to make moving out at 18 a possibility. The successful adults in my family all found a way and the first step was getting out. My siblings that stayed had more hardships than necessary and are still struggling (we\u2019re all mid 20s-mid 30s now). \n\nI\u2019m now in my 30s, successful career (not in insurance, though that remained a stable income through college) able to support my family even if my husband didn\u2019t also work. I had two dogs that I got after college (one passed away this year). \n\nI\u2019m writing this out to stress that I can empathize with your situation. The way out of this hell is education and opportunity. Prioritize that. You must take care of yourself before you\u2019re able to support your pets. Honestly, it was a bad decision to have pets when you\u2019re unable to care for them (vet bills, food costs, addtl fees when you rent, medication costs when they are super old). I know they are your babies, but the decision to get them in the first place needs to be remedied. It is the same advice I told myself when I was in high school that under no circumstances can I have a pet or end up pregnant because I have to get out. I asked for a dog every birthday and Christmas. Thank god my single mom hated animals or I would have been stuck making the same difficult decision to rehome them. It is so so so important for your future to rehome your pets. It is a better environment for them to rehome them too.", "NTA but your mum definitely is. Your sister is a victim of child sexual exploitation. Matt is likely grooming your other sibling also. Authorities have to be involved. Your mum has allowed a predatory man into the house IDGAF if he is still a \u2018minor\u2019 he shouldnt be be with a 14 yr old girl and DEFINITELY shouldnt be giving them Cigarettes and Alcohol.", "Ask your teacher if there's a program that can hook you up with a laptop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's allowing your 14yo sister to date a 17yo, which is problematic at the least and dangerous at the worst. 14 and 17 year old teenagers are in completely different developmental/maturity stages and your younger sister is likely being used by this 17 year old for whatever he can pressure her in to. Your mother is allowing her minor children to be in incredibly dangerous situations because she can't be bothered to parent. And I'm not saying all this on the fly or from the seat of my pants. I know from personal experience how dangerous the situation your family is in. If no one intervenes, your sister will end up pregnant before her 18th birthday. You seem to be the only person in your household that is trying your damndest to be responsible and mature. You deserve better than what you are dealing with. CPS 100% needs to be involved with this.

Kinda crap parenting if you ask me. NTA.

In my country (uk) 16 is the statutory age so a 17 year old doing things (assume since he's staying over all weekend getting drunk with your sister) could go to jail for sleeping with a 14 year old. Honestly the difference in age and maturity between a 17 and a 14 year old is HUGE. That would be my biggest concern. Your mother's lack of parenting and control in all this is insane.

Honestly, it sounds like your family could use some help.", "What makes you think she isn't already pregnant", "Hi, NTA and when it comes out what's going on, custody could be open to change.
