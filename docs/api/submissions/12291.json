A friend of mine asked me if he could use my login to watch it rather than pay for it himself. I said sure and sent him my username and password - but under the condition that I get to kick him out if he's watching it and I want to (I only have single screen access). He said that was fine.\n\nThis morning I went to watch the last episode and I got a message that I'm already watching somewhere else, so I message him asking him to quit so I can watch. (I know, sort of a dick move, but we did agree those terms, and also I only had an hour free this morning before work). He replies that it's not him, but that he'll ask \"Samantha\" to sign out. Samantha is a friend of his.\n\nI ask why Samatha has my login and he said he shared it with her. I asked why the hell he thought that was appropriate, and he said it's no big deal, she just wanted to watch the show too, she's a friend of his and I've met her and \"like her\", so I shouldn't care either. I told him that was a ridiculous thing to say, and he had no right to do that. \n\nI immediately signed into my account, kicked them both out and changed the password.\n\nHe's pissed at me, thinks I'm overreacting and won't apologise/ admit he was wrong. I think it was not an okay thing to do.\n\nWhich of us is TA?", "created_utc": 1678814729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rcfd0/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_friend_for_sharing_my/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s probably unlikely but in theory that\u2019s what could happen. Not to mention Samantha giving the login to her friend then before you know it half of the planet is freeloading off your subscription. At the end of the day it\u2019s about principle, he shouldn\u2019t have given it out. You shared it with your friend not Samantha.

Your friend, Samantha, and all the other people he shared your login with have such an easy solution to their \"problem\"--get their own account.", "And this is exactly why you never share your login credentials for anything with anyone. You have zero control who they choose to share it with, and who that person shares it with, and who that person...\n\nMaybe it's because I work in IT, people sharing login credentials is a pet peeve of mine. The only thing that peeves me more are the people who leave their passwords (all of them) on a postit on the case of a laptop itself.\n\nAnyway, NTA, you have pretty clear terms and your friend wasn't able to follow that.

You shared your password, and somehow you are flabbergasted by the result.  They.......well, that's easy.", "ESH. I say this because who gives out their password?  If you do, they have the potential to access your personal information as well as lock you out of your own account.

If there are subsequent texts from this duo, I suggest you share them on r/ChoosingBeggars.

You agreed to share the account with him and only him and he disregarded that. \n\nEven while this may seem small, you should probably take this into consideration regarding what kind of 'friend' he is. If you can't trust him to keep your account password/information safe without him getting pissy, imagine how he might act if you try to trust him with something more important in the future.\n\nYou did the right thing by kicking them off.
