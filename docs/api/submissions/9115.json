What an exhausting situation for you when you're just buying road food at a gas station! It's not like you were in a restaurant and you ordered and ate while she sat there hungry. Does she always make you walk on eggshells for absolutely no reason? Why would you be expected to pick out her food? Sounds like no matter what you did, she would've been annoyed at you.", "NTA. How is it disrespectful to order food a few minutes before her? You're both getting something to eat; who cares how far apart the orders are made? And would she have yelled at you for bringing her the wrong kind of food? Sounds like a lose/lose situation either way.", "NTA.  Your gf is totally overreacting.  She said she didn't know what she wanted and you ordering isn't a big deal.  It's her that is disrespecting you by her childish fit and behaviour.", "NTA --- Your not a mind reader and like you said whatever you would have ordered for her would probably have been wrong anyway.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you could have done better is tell her what you were going to do before you did it.\n\nHer overreaction made her go hungry, that's not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYou knew what you wanted to order and she didn\u2019t. You placed your order and decided to check on her after the fact. I think your response could have been better, but since it sounds like she never told you to wait until she decided on something, there was no need for her to be hostile about the situation.", "NTA. Both of you were in the gas station, not a restaurant where the waiter disappears for several minutes after ordering. She still could have ordered something a minute or two after you were done, but she chose to walk out with nothing.", "NTA. In a restaurant, sure, this would've been strange and rude. But if you're going to be eating in the car, how on earth does it matter if you buy your food before she chooses what she wants?? This seems like a very strong, concerning reaction that smacks of emotional manipulation. Either that or there's something else she's upset about and is projecting onto this, like she thinks you don't care due to other things and this is \"proof\" that you only care about yourself by ordering first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think she wanted you to order for her like you're assuming, she just wanted you to wait for her to grab her water and order together. My SO and I have had times where we have to compromise on efficiency vs quality, like when we're running errands on the weekend. Yeah, we could probably get them done a little faster if he went one place and I went the other, but we more often go to both places together because being together is often more of a priority than getting it done faster. I think that's what she means by considering her feelings - not asking you to consider what she wanted, but just waiting for her to do it together.", "Nta she's probably just mad because if you ordered together, she'd probably expect you to pay for everything and you ordering before her ruined that even though she didn't even know what she wanted in the first place. I've ordered separately many times over the years with different partners when I knew what I wanted but they didn't, makes things easier for the ones preparing your food, instead of holding up the line. Sometimes it helped them pick what they wanted since they knew what I had and could trade bites.", "NTA, it might have been a little rude to not order with her but definitely not worth being that mad over. I kno0w most people would not care.", "You're both AHs. You could have waited and she over reacted. Assuming you're eating together the polite thing would be to order together so you're eating at roughly the same time. However you being impolite didn't merit her stomping off. You both need to work on your relationship.", "Soft YTA. You couldn\u2019t have just said \u201cI know what I want. Okay if I just go ahead and order?\u201d", "Kinda YTA. You don't order for yourself when with others, until everyone is ready to order. However, she did have a rather childish reaction which caused her to not get food. But then, you didn't think to grab her something, anything. That's was a bit mean. You're going to need to learn to be more considerate and thoughtful. Even if this relationship doesn't work you'll have the same issue in the next.", "NTA\n\nThis is nonsense. Extremely disrespectful on what planet...\n\n1. She doesn't know what she wants\n2. Sounds like she might have possibly ended up ordering nothing.\n3. She could well have ended up picking up something that didn't need ordering.\n4. She then didn't order or buy anything anyway\n5. You are then supposed to mind read what she wanted and order her something anyway.....\n\nSorry but had you been in the car for 10 hours. Because this sounds like picking an argument for argument sake.... I am not sure why you are apologising except to make the ridiculousness go away...\n\nOr Question if you had waited for her would you have ended up paying for her food and drink? Is this about her having to potentially pay for herself?", "NTA-it's a gas station..so her reaction seems extreme for the situation.", "NTA. It was a gas station, not French Laundry", "NTA but she is ridiculous and childish. You did nothing disrespectful. You ordered your breakfast. She couldn't make up her mind and wandered away. She seems like way too much drama.", "NTA. Girlfriend sounds exhausting. Ordering first is not disrespectful at a gas station.", "NAH - But your GF needs to get off her high horse. She\u2019s a big girl and she can make decisions for herself - if she wants food all she has to do was order some.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you would have to wait?", "NTA.\n\nShe would have been literally minutes behind you ordering.\n\nShe also chose to leave and not eat no way I would have got her food and I wouldn't have apologised for not getting food. Its a pathetic power play, she's hungry because of her own childishness not yours.", "NTA I assume she is a grown up, or at least competent enough to order her own damn food.    She's acting like a small child throwing a tantrum.", "NTA. Your gf sounds verrrrry high-maintenance. I would have zero patience for that kind of passive aggression.", "What?? Having worked at convenience stores for several years I can say there\u2019s a high chance that your food would not be ready at exactly the same time even if you ordered together. Fried foods take longest followed by hot foods and then cold is the quickest. It just makes them hold onto it vs handing it over individually. This is a strange hill to die on.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how ordering food first is disrespectful?", "NTA. Like wtf did she expect. \n\u201cWhile I am starving, and my food they have got, I shall wait for your order my queen, since what food you know not\u201d", "NTA - it sounds like she does this all the time and you knew you\u2019d be standing around for 30 minutes while she pondered the options before deciding she\u2019d prefer to eat someplace else", "NTA. a: You are not a mind reader. b: Were you a mind reader, you would not be able to read hers as she clearly does not know what she wants. Reconsider this GF if she tends to make an issue of something so petty.", "NTA what ?", "Run Forest, Run!", "Yes, definitely not worth staying hungry over it. NTA", "They are buying stuff to eat in the car...no one is sitting down at a table.", "This is a gas station. You typically order at a machine and it spits a receipt at you. She\u2019s overreacting as she could have literally just done this herself as well with virtually no difference.", "Doesn't matter where it is. No one I know would do that.", "I feel like she\u2019s mad because she wanted you to order together so you would pay for her, but doesn\u2019t want to admit it. \n\nBut for whatever reason she\u2019s is mad still NTA she has ridiculous expectations", "NTA. Why didn't she just say \"I'm not sure yet, but please wait to order until I do\"? It's not hard.", "NTA Is she really worth all this drama?", "NTA. who orders together at a gas station? I mean sure if you are paying together maybe, but if she doesn't know what she wants, it's totally normal to order separately and then go grab whatever drinks, chips, etc. you want to finish out your meal. at a fuckin gas station lol.", "Wow she sounds like hard work. NTA", "NTA.  Sounds like if you had waited for her to decide you'd still be in that gas station.", "NTA. This is not about food, or ordering breakfast. It sounds like she felt the need to stir up some drama to get your attention and breakfast was a convenient excuse. The way to solve this is for her to learn to say what's really on her mind, and for you to be able to hear and understand it.", "I didn't know a princess would eat at a gas station.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour gf got angry over something ridiculous and then chose to pout like a child. She chose to go to the car without getting any food. That is 100% on her. She needs to grow up.", "INFO: Did you pay your stuff? Is she pussed she has to pay her own way, for a change?", "NTA. Must be hard dating someone so codependent they can\u2019t even order their own food nor figure out that if you end up ordering the same it\u2019s only a matter of a minute or so in difference and heck if she orders something quicker she might have even gotten her food before her.", "Nta and she being dramatic for no reason. If she wants food she can go order for herself", "NTA If this is like the gas stations around here you\u2019re ordering from a touch screen kiosk. You were both going to be eating in the car. Who cares?", "NTA And want to bet this woman makes a point of telling people she's not here for the drama?", "NTA. I'm tired just reading her shit.", "Going against the grain, but you're totally the AH here.\n\nYou couldn't wait 5 minutes to order? That's insanely rude and inconsiderate. You're a couple, a partnership, a pack. Packs eat together when they are together.\n\nEven your \"she didn't have to feel offended\" comment was out of line. You're basically saying her feelings shouldn't matter. Like she's not allowed to feel hurt that you ate without her?\n\nYes, it's on her to make sure she eats, but this was an avoidable scenario where your impatience led to alienating yourself from your partner.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f. GF sounds really high maintenance.", "Right?  Maybe rethink this relationship.", "What does that matter?"]}
