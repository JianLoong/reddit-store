It started many years ago in earlier childhood. Our dad died when my sister was only 1 and I was only 6. Our mom remarried less than a year later and my sister gained a dad, but I was only ever able or willing to see him as a stepfather. This has been a problem for my sister and for my stepfather. I have not cared for him in quite some time. My sister adores him and everything he does. She is very protective of him and perceives me as someone who insults him every day of my life because I refuse to call him my dad and I refused his offer to adopt me when she was adopted. There have been moments over the years where she would become angry at me for refusing to add a photo of my stepfather to my room or for refusing to buy him a Father's Day card addressed to a father.\n\nShe was angry on her dad's behalf when I moved into my home with my husband and did not display a single photo of him but had many of my dad. She told me my home was a big middle finger to her dad and was insulting to the two of them, as well as lacking the heart to be a home.\n\nMy sister asked if we could put our issues aside and become closer. It's only the two of us and she feels like I don't want anything to do with her. So we met and we spoke and we met again and we spoke and we spent a little time getting to know each other as adults. The issue at hand was not raised until last week when she said we needed to talk about it. She told me how much it hurts her that I feel like her dad isn't good enough or worthy enough to be called dad when he has done everything to be an awesome dad to the two of us. She said it feels like I want to punish them both for dad's death and for them becoming father and daughter so easily. I told her I had not wanted to do that but if that's how she felt then I was sorry. She told me she could never understand and I said she never would be able to. That because of our ages when dad died, we had different childhoods. I told her she did not grieve and mourn the same way I did, not that she didn't at all, but I had known and had memories of dad and it made him irreplaceable for me. I said nobody, no matter how good they might be, could measure up to the man who was taken from me too soon. I also told her that her dad's offense at not being called dad and not being allowed to adopt me meant our experiences with him were different also. I told her that would always be something we could never fully have in common and if she needed me to see how she felt then I needed her to see how I felt.\n\nMy sister became agitated and angry and accused me of making light of her grief and she told me the different childhoods thing is bullshit and I'm simply refusing to move on.

Maybe you've got a little bit of rose colored glasses (you seem to remember your dad as perfect, when in reality he was just human), but that doesn't take away from the fact that you and your sister did have very different experiences with your dad and stepdad. There's nothing wrong with that, it just is what it is. \n\nI think that until shes mature enough to acknowledge that you had *very* different experiences with your dad's death due to the age difference, you'll probably be at an impasse. Just let her know that you're not trying to minimize her grief/experience, you just want her to recognize that it's fundamentally different because of your respective ages at the time.", "NTA. You seem very well-balanced about this and you're absolutely right that the two of you had vastly different childhoods. It's a little weird that your sister, at 22, can't see that and needs you to play happy families. I hope you can get past this. And I'm sorry for your loss. Take care.", "NTA.  You tried, she did not.  You shared with her, she rejected it.  Stepparents don\u2019t get to bulldoze their way to parent, it\u2019s something that occurs when the circumstances merit.  Your remembrance of your father and the attempts by others to force you to obliterate his memory precluded any acceptance.  Your sister is out of line.  She\u2019s unwilling to maturely see the situation.  She\u2019s the inverse of you - her lack of remembrance of her genetic parent and embrace of the only father she clearly remembers causes her to reject your feelings.  She is intentionally and willfully part of the problem.  Her aggressive rejection of a honest assessment of the situation, her pushing the issue,  and her conduct make her TA.  Sorry y\u2019all can\u2019t be close siblings.", "NTA I have a sibling with a large gap & despite us sharing the same biological parents we totally had differing childhoods from each other, everyone in the family acknowledges this. Neither was bad just different. \n\nFrom the sounds of it your step father tried too hard to be \u2018dad\u2019 got sulky when you pushed back as most 7/8/9yrs olds would & therefore any bond was harder to form so you naturally see him as different to your sister who at just 2/3 would have taken much more easily to the dad/daughter relationship. I think your sister is the unreasonable one but she is pretty young so given a bit more maturity maybe in the future you can get closer.", "NTA, for saying it; you\u2019re right. You did have different childhood experiences. That\u2019s just a fact. Your sister and stepfather need to be more understanding about what you call your stepfather. (I\u2019m assuming you just use his first name and not a insulting nicknames). That said, unless you haven\u2019t shared something in this story, absolutely refusing all images of him in your home seems a bit extreme. He\u2019s been around since you were 6; that\u2019s a long time to harbor animosity for him.", "Your sister doesn't get it. Your position is entirely understandable. It was right for you to say the things you did. Hopefully your sister can take some time to reflect, and grow in her perception of you and your family. \n\nYou are entitled to have your own relationship with your step father. Your sister is in the wrong for taking up her father's side and inserting herself into your relationship with him. Whether or not you love your step father has no bearing on her love for him, and she needs to back off. It's not her business. \n\nIs your stepfather contributing to this dynamic? I can imagine how he might be hurt by your rejection, but as the adult, as your parent, hurt feelings are really not an appropriate thing to express in this situation. Losing a parent is a huge deal. He should be able to be a committed, loving person in your life without the expectation that you would ever call him Dad. A parent's relationship with a child is not reciprocal.", "Nta. She is not mature enough for this conversation or to have a relationship with you. She wants you to hear and understand her feelings/ perspective but wants to g\u2019nite yours? \n\nShe just wants you to adopt whatever she feels. She just wants to make you feel what she wants you to feel.", "NTA\n\n>She told me my home was a big middle finger to her dad and was insulting to the two of them, as well as lacking the heart to be a home.\n\n You can tell her that her not caring about your dad is insulting to you and him (even if he is dead). \n\nNot having pics with your stepdad in your house doesn't mean your house lacks the heart to be a home. Your life, unlike hers, doesn't revolve around your stepdad.", "NAH - there\u2019s no interpersonal conflict here, just feelings and emotions. \n\nBut I do think your sister is right. You have whatever relationship you want with your stepfather but it does sound like you have not really allowed yourself to process your father\u2019s death.", "NAH\n\nI wonder what other areas of your life this is affecting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She shouldn\u2019t be involving herself in your relationship with your stepdad. The choice of being adopted is very personal and what\u2019s right for her might not be for you. \n\nShe needs to focus on your personal relationships and stop getting upset about your relationship with your stepdad", ">My sister became agitated and angry and accused me of making light of her grief and she told me the different childhoods thing is bullshit and I'm simply refusing to move on. \n\nHello projection, my old friend. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nNothing ensures a child will never have a parental relationship with you than trying to force it on them, and then holding a grudge against them when they reject said forced relationship.\n\nAlso, if you consider a parent and child relationship a two way street where the kid has to love you to deserve love in return, you aren't cut out to be a good parent anyway. Bio, adopted, step, foster or otherwise. You chose to be a parent and owe the child the follow through on that choice no matter what, the child didn't make any such choice that they need to follow through on.\n\nYou said you didn't want your step dad to replace your bio dad, he should have respected that and loved you anyway by whatever name you chose to use for him, even if that meant backing off sometimes. That's how he would have been a good parental figure to you.\n\nThat was his responsibility to rise up to but he was too selfish to meet it. Who knows how strong your relationship might be now if he had.\n\nYou are NTA for keeping a man like that at a distance and NTA for telling your sister the truth.\n\nAs a side note though, maybe your sister unconsciously realised that he will only give as much love to his kids as they give to him, and that's why she's like this. Maybe she's scared he will withhold love if she stops speaking against you not wanting him as your dad.", "It sounds like your sister is the one who needs to seek therapy. No offense. If she respected you and your decisions you wouldn\u2019t have a problem. Same goes for stepdad. ( Stepdad is the real AH for helping to pit you both against the other.) Does she even realize she actually had a dad before stepdad? It doesn\u2019t sound like it. I get it though. I was raised by a stepmom who was more of a mother than my living mother. But she didn\u2019t pass and that is the difference. NTA at all. Your sister should really get help because her defensiveness on her position tells me she lacks maturity and understanding. Or she just wants one happy perfect family.", "NTA - Does your sister have any photos or memorabilia of your bio Dad in her room or anywhere at all?", "NTA.\n\nUp front no one should dictate to you your relationship with anyone else.  \n\nAt any point in this saga was there a suggestion of therapy to include both you and your step-father aimed at trying to get the two of you to a place you can both be happy with?  Or the whole family, actually, post 2nd marriage?  If not I wish there had been - it might have helped change the situation all find yourselves in now.  It may \\*still\\* help really.\n\nThe only thing I can say about the relationship between you and your sister is that she probably feels what she feels as strongly as you do and sounds less equipped to deal with it.", "NTA \n\nAnd you\u2019re absolutely correct in the difference in childhood. Your mom should have handled this situation when it happened instead of enabling it. It\u2019s unfortunate that your sister can\u2019t see past what she perceived as grievances against her dad and herself. She still won\u2019t accept your valid reasons and if this continues you might want to consider cutting contact. \n\nOne thing that really made me angry on your behalf was when she insulted your husband and your home. It shows how immature she still is! Of course for her it\u2019s lacking the heart to be a home since it\u2019s not her home nor her dads. Hopefully one day she will realize that the heart of the home isn\u2019t the place you dwell in but the people that dwell in that place. In this case your heart is your husband.", "NTA Out of curiosity what has your mom said about all this, about the relationship between you and stepdad and rejection of adoption etc?", "NTA. I\u2019d ask her what she would have done if your stepfather had passed away and your mom immediately married someone who wanted to replace your stepfather. Does she think he\u2019s so replaceable?", "That is a fair point. I mostly focus on the amazing because that is what I remember mostly. I was so young when he died it was hard to know the less perfect side. If he had been around longer to raise me into my teens I'm sure I'd have found some complaints lol. \n\nThat is putting it into the perfect words. I'm not sure if my sister is capable of getting there. Ideally we would be able to respect that the journey of loss and a new stepparent has been different for both of us and accept that we're not the same, neither are our experiences, but we can have a relationship anyway.", "I think it's her defense mechanism that gets in the way. She feels like my different relationship with her dad is an insult. I would say part of that comes from him viewing it as an insult. So she feels as though accepting the reality of events would be allowing the insult against him. All it actually does is drive us apart but I think she feels as though she is doing right by him.", "Yes, that is exactly it. Even beyond sulky at times. He was offended. Sometimes he appeared truly angry about it. Any respect I had for him went because it was not something he got over. He carried that around with him and showed his displeasure. He has the ability to do good as evidenced by how much my sister adores him. But he didn't accept my no. It made him bitter instead.", "It's very common for children with the same bio-parents, living in the same house to have very different childhoods.   I have a friend who is  8 years older than his youngest sister and often says \"We had the same parents, the difference was, hers were rich and mine weren't\".  Their parents financial situation improved dramatically when he was in high school, so the youngest never had to do without anything.\n\nThere are so many stories here about step parents who expected to be seen as the only dad/mom and were never able to bond with a child who had active memories of their bio-parent.   He's sad because if they were able to back off and accept the role of an involved third adult, the relationship could have been much more successful.", "The animosity between us now stems from his reactions to me calling him by his first name instead of dad, and turning down his offer to adopt me when I was a child. He holds a grudge for both of those things and I was unable to warm up to him because of it. I knew he didn't like it. I don't like that he cared so little about my feelings that he would be angry at me for saying no to both those things. I was respectful. I never used insults against him. But he was unable to accept not being as important to me as he was to my sister.", "I don't think OP is refusing photos in the house so much as choosing what sentimental objects they want displayed in their home. It's their home. They don't have to put up pictures of certain people if they don't want to. If my dad's wife ever demanded I put up family pictures with her in it in my home instead of my dead mother, I'd tell her and anyone who agreed with her to go pound salt because it's my home.", "I think he is possibly contributing to it. I feel as though him showing the offense he has over the issue, the range of emotions he has shown about it, anger included, that it has fueled my sister's belief that my decision to call him by his name instead of dad and my saying no to his adopting me, is an insult to him. I feel like it has trapped her in the cycle of feeling like she needs to defend him and stand up for him.", "I have processed his death the best I could possibly process the loss of the most important man in my early life. For me there was no moving forward and accepting a new father or equal father figure into my life and heart.", "NTA, and Completely Agree with jrm1102.  I think there\u2019s some good reasons to try a couple sessions of therapy here, With or without sister present, to see if you can put closure to this terrible thing that happened to the both of you at such a young age.", "The issues between my sister and I? I can't say it affects other areas of my life.", "Your sister is insisting that you look at life through the same lens as she does, and that's irrational.\n\nIt's fine that she sees stepdad the way she does, it's fine that you don't. The assholeness on her part comes when she insists that you see stepdad the way she does.\n\nThe assholeness of stepdad comes in him insisting that you see him as father the way your sister does. That's irrational and intrusive. It also damaged your relationship with him - had he not insisted on being dad, had he simply been an additional nice supportive adult in your life, you'd likely feel a lot warmer towards him than you do. This is also something your sister is unable to comprehend.\n\nIt sounds like you need to de-emphasize your sister in your life. She seems unable to have a relationship with you unless you adopt her views, and that's untenable.", "It sounds to me like your sister needs some therapy to help her get some perspective.   She identifies too much with your stepfather and doesn't want to understand your position at all.", "NTA, your stepdad is for not respecting your feelings and not realizing he was putting your sister against you", "I am sorry he wouldn\u2019t listen. Total AH move to dump his adult expectations & anger on a child. \nHopefully your sister can mature & realize why your relationships with him differ.", "Your feelings are valid. I just meant it\u2019s no way to live. Have you tried counseling (if that\u2019s available to you). Stepdad and sister could probably use it too. I think this is a common stepparent mistake (trying to a force a close relationship). But if it\u2019s causing so much turmoil; perhaps telling them your going NC until they respect your feelings? Either way NTA as I said.", "I wasn\u2019t thinking \u201cinstead of\u201d I was thinking \u201cin addition too\u201d.", "I think at any time a stepparent should accept that it is up to the child to choose whether or not to act/see the parent as stepparent or not. It is nice if the kids cals you daddy or mommy, but it is not relevant indoing your best as a parent and raising a kid properly.\n\nI don't think you should blame your sister, but clearly your (step)parents have made the isse way too importent and she has grown up with the feeling that you did something wrong", "I have attended therapy frequently over the last five years. Therapy is a great tool to access and I do feel it has helped me.", "The issues you have with your father. Your step-father. And your sister. And your mother remarrying.\n\nIt's clearly more than *just* your sister.", "I understand. If my stepfather had never shown any resentment or anger over my choice to call him by his name and to say no to being adopted, I would say it would be better to find a way to work through it all together. But he was still bitter about it last time I saw him. I can't hold any respect for him when he's like that toward me, for something I consider to be a fair part of being a stepparent. I can acknowledge he has good points when my sister is as close to him and as protective of him as she has been for most of her life.\n\nETA: I have been attending therapy and it has been helpful. I am no contact with my stepfather now.", "He was and adult holding a grudge against a six year old for loving her dead father. He even screwed up the relationship between op and her little sister. And he's still holding the damn grudge! Imagine how great their relationship would have been if he'd behaved like an adult. \n\nYou can't alienate your step daughter this way and expect a perfect father daughter relationship. He broke it, if he wants it fixed, he can get to work fixing it. \n\nOp is not the problem here.", "That's nice, but still not necessary. Honestly I wouldn't be too keen on putting up pictures of a person who couldn't accept their role in my life and had become petty/distant because their demand to be allowed to replace my dead loved one wasn't met.  I'm sure OP and stepdad and sister would have a much better relationship if stepdad could've accepted the relationship OP could offer as a child who was grieving the loss of their father for years and gave their relationship room to breathe and grow, instead of trying to force themselves into a a family role that, for OP, was not open to fill and then both stepdad and sister turning on them after they did not want to be adopted. He still cannot just accept being a loved stepdad called by his name and is sour about not being seen as their dad. Imagine the doorways that could open if he could just accept that while OP cares for them, he can't replace their dad. OP might even want to put a picture of him up then.", "It is more than just my sister. There are issues with my stepfather and those have not spilled into my life in any other way than I no longer have a relationship with him and he lost my respect a long time ago.\n\nNone of it has affected my life outside of the relationships with them. The loss of my dad and my grief is still present but I attended therapy and that helped me figure out my path forward without him. But it has not prevented me from having a good life. Even before therapy I was still capable of happiness and enjoying my life. I can just miss my dad and wish he was here in a less intrusive way when certain periods of my life come up."]}
