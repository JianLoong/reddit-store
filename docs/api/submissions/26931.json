{"id": 26931, "submission_id": "16jjgc7", "title": "AITA for not vacating the house for my mom a third and fourth time?", "selftext": "So I live with my mom and we both pay rent. She works days and I work nights. She wants to have \u201cgirls nights\u201d without me in the house. When it was her birthday, she asked me two back to back weekends each if I could stay out of the house. Because it was her birthday, I reluctantly agreed (and wound up with two fresh bite marks as a result of taking care of two dogs new to each other). Now she wants me to leave again and wants to plan me leaving again with only a week gap. \n\nAITA for not wanting to give up half of my off days for a third and fourth time? Is this normal roommate behavior? Usually just try to take it because I want to be a good roommate, but I haven\u2019t asked for anything like this even once and I feel like this is an unfair request especially repeatedly. I was going to just sleep in my car to accommodate her request, but she texted me that she wanted to do it a four time in two weeks, and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m unwanted in the place I pay rent to live. To clarify, she is asking me to leave for one day each out of my two days off.\n\nEdit: she has given me the choices of either staying with my grandpa 30 miles away or staying with a friend.", "created_utc": 1694798866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jjgc7/aita_for_not_vacating_the_house_for_my_mom_a/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That would be totally unacceptable and inappropriate request from a roommate, and it's galling that your mother is totally fine with you sleeping in your car to give her \"space\". It may be better to put your rent money to use in a new place where your rights be in the place where you pay to live will be respected.", "NTA.\n\nMove.\n\nYou need a more compatible roomie.", "Holy shit, that\u2019s toxic! What kind of shitty mom is she? Even for a room mate that\u2019s asking too much. But a mom? She obviously doesn\u2019t give a shit about you.\n\nNTA you need to find a different accommodation solution", "This seems out of order unless she pays for you to stay somewhere, even then its not fair every or everywhere weekend", "NTA - \"Well, tell you what, if you want me out of the home that I pay rent to live in for the weekend, you will need to put me up for the weekend at this nice resort I found here...\"\n\nOr more realistically, \"No, I'm sorry, I pay rent to live here, it is my home. Perhaps you should work it out and have girls weekend at one of your friend's homes for a change. Otherwise, I will be here, in my home.\"\n\nIt's unreasonable to ask you even the first time to leave your home for the weekend so she can have a party.", "NTA, you should ask her to pay you to stay at a hotel if she refuses then don't leave the house, you pay rent too, it's not fair", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve never been asked by a room/house mate or a family member to stay away for the weekend. That\u2019s just not normal behaviour for people in a shared living situation.\n\nEspecially now she\u2019s trying to do it most weekends.\n\nYou either need to learn the word no. Do it back to her so she learns the inconvenience or find somewhere else to live. Honestly I\u2019d be inclined to text back saying \u201cawkward, I was planning to ask you the same thing this weekend given I\u2019ve stayed away so much lately. I just wanted to have some friends round and have the place to myself\u201d", "NTA, however you should both address this situation together as roommates. Would she be willing to pay more in rent for the days you need to be away from home? If she did pick up more of the rent, would this be a satisfactory solution for you?\n\nUltimately you would both be wise to find different housing options.", "I'd rather be the ass wipe than continue anything with your mom except  civility. You are not her convenience crutch.", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA\n\nThis is an unfair living arrangement. If it's possible to live with someone else or on your own that might be a much better option for both of you.\n\nShe can always attempt to leave the apartment for other arrangements if your presence is an issue too btw..\n\ngood luck!", "NTA, you pay half the rent and utilities?  If so, then you're entitled to live there.  It was nice of you to give her the space for her birthday . . . TWICE . . . but that's enough.", "NTA\nHer requests that you leave your home are excessive and inappropriate. The whole point of renting is to have your home space. She is denying you the peaceful enjoyment of your home far too often for, what? What does she need you out of the house for that going to your room for a while wouldn't accomplish equally well?\n\nAsk her how convenient she would find it to vacate the same amount of time. However, her answer doesn't change the fact that she is asking too much of you. Then, when you did it for her a couple times, she wants to make it a habit!", "Does your mother need help? If not, and you're an adult, move out. It's her house. She's your mother. Not your roommate.", "NTA. What she's asking you to do is not normal roommate behaviour. It sounds like she wants to make it out like she's living alone when she's actually not. Do not sleep in your car. Remind her it's your home too and you can keep out of the way, but you won't be gone.", "NTA. I'd move out.", "NTA you pay rent. I'd tell her you'd stick to your room but no way are you leaving every weekend a month (unless she wants to start paying more and you wanted to save cash).
