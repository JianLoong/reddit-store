Your reaction is justified. This has been going on too long. Especially if you have told her and reported her, it isn't funny, and it is scary. Most stalkers are men, so the research about women stalkers is not as extensive, and the behaviors and escalations do differ. It is possible that this type of emotional confrontation is what will make her stop. I hope that is the case. Keep all the information you have, any evidence, screen shots, or anything.

It could turn violent.", "Go to the police, it's stalking, harrassment and putting your photos on the internet without your consent", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely take this further to cover yourself.\n\nAs for the friend who said your reaction was extremely cruel, ask him how he would feel if he was the object of her obsession?

There was a chick in my Freshman cooking class that I had never seen before. She was way out of my league in the looks department, like 8/10, but was a total nutbucket. Never spoke to anyone, just stared at me all the time unless I happened to look up. Then she would look away. I mean I could feel her eyes boring holes into my fucking head from across the room. I played it cool and kept my distance the entire semester. She wasn't there our tenth grade year but came back our Junior year. By that point, I had refined my game quite a bit, and that kind of attention towards me was all I needed for the sharkfin to be cresting the water (Cue Jaws theme).\n\nShe was back to her old tricks of eye-fucking me from afar. I made my move on her after breaking up with my then-girlfriend. It was a quiet pump and dump situation before it even got all that far. Banged her a few times on the QT and then set her adrift. Once I did that, I knew she would never want to see me again and I went back to my girlfriend a couple weeks later, who was never the wiser.  \n\nActually, I pulled that one twice during that relationship. I'd find someone I wanted to fuck, break up and do it. Then go back.

The authority figurese in your life are just appalling, this should have been nipped in the bud ages ago. I wonder how many other kids are being stalked in  your school because people think it's, \"cute\", and they \"should be flattered\"?

Your parent's argument, and if I were you, I'd mention this too, is the same as telling a male victim of rape that he's a guy and he clearly enjoyed it because he had an erection. (Physical responses aren't always controllable, so fuck that noise) You being a guy and her being a girl doesn't make it flattered. You shouldn't be flattered. You should be creeped out. You are.

I needed people to literally surround me at lunch so he wouldn't force himself next to me and he would still sit nearby and stare at me all lunch. after weeks of this and teachers not really seeing a problem (not even the one who let me hide in his classroom during lunch), I went to the school administration\n\nthey told me that I should be nicer to the boy. the vice principal told me that the boy didn't have many friends and he just looked up to me and he wasn't doing anything harmful and why couldn't I be nicer and more understanding of him. while he had the support of the administration and teachers, at least didn't have social support because he was considered a \"weird loser.\" he wasn't thought of that way because he harassed me, or because of the other people he had harassed. but because he was disabled and considered unattractive \n\nthe second time someone started harassing me in school and stalking me....

This is how my stalker in high school started! \n\nDuring lunch we (my friends and I) were standing at our lockers just eating and being kids, when apparently this random guy, 2 years older, was talking to his friend and she asked who he thought was cute and interested in to date and he pointed out me. His friend knew the older sister of one of my \u201cfriends\u201d and contacted her to get my information. \n\nIn the beginning it was weird, but harmless. He would send me texts, messages on msn and such. I didn\u2019t know the guy, never noticed him (I have adhd, so if he wasn\u2019t standing right in front of me talking, I wouldn\u2019t see him). My \u201cfriends\u201d and his friend kept encouraging him to talk to me. At some point I was walking to school with a girl that was in his year and I got a text saying :\u201dYou look so cute today, give *girl I was walking with* my regards\u201d and we were incredibly creeped out! \n\nThen the guy decided it would be a good idea to give me chocolates. But because he was too shy, so he put it on top of our lockers and my \u201cfriends\u201d had to give it to me, so they did. I walked up to him to give the chocolates back, and telling him, I\u2019m not interested, please leave me alone! And his response was to \u201cgive the chocolates to my friends, they would like them\u201d. I didn\u2019t eat any out of principle and my \u201cfriends\u201d told me I was mean and ate all the chocolates. \n\nHe kept stalking me until he left school, 2 years later. It was horrible. I never felt safe, I was never alone, always with someone. I realized my so called \u201cfriends\u201d were only encouraging him and cut them off. If they didn\u2019t realize how wrong they were encouraging a creepy stalker, they were no friends. \n\nEven today, over 10 years and another stalker later, I have severe trust issues.. \n\nIf you say no, it means no. Girls can be just as creepy as guys, even the shy ones, it\u2019s those types that are the most likely to escalate, \u201cbecause they mean no harm, just have a crush and they are sooo incredibly shy, you are just mean!\u201d \n\nSo, conclusion, you are NTA. If your \u201cfriend\u201d is saying you were cruel and your actions were uncalled for, ask them what they would do in your situation and ask yourself if they are really your friend and not encouraging the creepy girl behind your back\u2026 perseverance is fine, but not to this point!", "NTA and feel free to remind your \u201cfriend\u201d that if a guy was doing this to her she would feel invaded and threatened not complimented and it shouldn\u2019t be different for you just because you\u2019re a guy.

So basically I had to work every day to avoid him for months until he was gone\n\nMy ex was more complicated. We started dating and he got possessive and controlling and jealous very quickly and I knew I needed out but that breaking up with him would be dangerous. So I needed him to dump me and I needed it to be his idea. And it couldn't be because I had done anything wrong or he would also be dangerous. even if I was just too busy with school and other activities, he was mad I didn't prioritise him\n\nSo I pretended to be sick. To be honest I did not have a good plan if that did not work. But he had dated around a bit before dating me, and he had become so obsessive so quickly that I was banking on him dumping me relatively quickly also. So I just faked sick and I missed school and I missed school and I missed school. I made sure that everyone thought I was sick. My sister didn't know I was faking so when he came by the house she would tell him that I was sick and had been home all day. I need sure to miss the calls of most of my friends in the same social group and only occasionally answered one of them and made it sound like I had just woken up and I had a really creaky voice or kept coughing. I would still respond to his texts but only like every 12th text and hours later. I made sure to fill up my voicemail as well so he couldn't leave me voicemails but also he knew that I was not checking my voicemail because the box was full. So basically I engineered a situation in which he wouldn't see me and he would get annoyed at not seeing me but he couldn't get jealous - not even of my spending time with friends or on extracurriculars because I was literally just sick in bed. It took most of a month but it worked. He dumped me\n\nWell it worked mostly. Some time later he started stalking me again, I guess I fell back into interest. But I largely avoided him and pretended to be hurt that he'd dumped me and made it look like I was just focusing on school. I avoided our mutual social group and ate lunch in classrooms of amendable teachers and did work. So essentially I made it impossible for him to have any opportunity to talk to me privately or any space in which he could confront me. Avoid avoid avoid essentially. He escalated for awhile and then cooled off. Thought that was it but then he came round again. This happened for a bit. I'm pretty sure that he essentially stalked me in between new love interests.

They may be drugged.\n\nDo not accept any gifts from your stalker, no matter how expensive. They may have tracking devices attached. Also, if you accept a gift, she may later use this as 'evidence' that you are really in a relationship. Destroy any gifts as soon as you safely can.\n\nDo not allow yourself to be alone with your stalker. Travel in packs of trusted friends when you are in school. Outside of school, avoid isolated or darkened areas, stick to well-lit public places.\n\nEvaluate your behaviour in general - you want to make your dislike of her plain to her. More importantly, you want to make your dislike of her plain to everyone around you, so that if/when she makes an unpleasant allegation, you will have witnesses to back you up. Use loud and shock-inducing phrases like 'I said NO!' or 'Stop harassing me!'. If you feel scared, say so, loudly.\n\nRemove as much private material from the internet as possible.\n\nBuy net curtains for your windows so no-one can see into your bedroom in the day, and keep the blinds or curtains drawn the second it gets dark. Remain fully-dressed in public places at all times. Under no circumstances should you use your school changing rooms or showers, she may be watching. \n\nIf you have a school locker, stop using it - keep your belongings on you at all times. If you have a car, check for tracking devices (remember some modern tracking devices can be as small as a coin). If possible, don't bring your car to school. Leave it locked in the garage and carpool with a friend instead. \n\nIf you are forced into a circumstance where you must interact with her, do your best not to engage. Try not to become emotional. Be clear about the fact that she's scaring you and you don't want to interact. Be loud - the more witnesses, the safer you are.\n\nStart a FU binder. Record every interaction with her, including dates and locations. Print off any written/computerised evidence of her being creepy and add it to the binder. If you need to get a restraining order, the FU binder will provide valuable evidence. Make at least two copies of this binder, and store at least one of them in a safe location outside your home.\n\nRemember that people who have been rejected sexually can become violent. Start taking safety precautions like not walking home alone at night and being constantly aware of your surroundings. This is especially important if you live in a place where guns are generally available: stalkers with grudges and guns should be treated as serious health-and-safety risks!\n\nConsider going to the police and making a complaint about her. In theory, the police are supposed to help innocent people who are targeted by stalkers. They may be able to scare her off. They may be able to put you in touch with resources or charities that support stalking victims. They will also be able to start a paper trail - if your stalker becomes violent, coercive or rapey, then an existing paper trail could be the difference between her facing justice and her being allowed to torment you unhindered.\n\n(Unfortunately, you may be in a situation where police involvement is useless or even dangerous. If you are POC or LGBT, then contacting the police may be a bad idea. Think carefully before getting the cops involved!)\n\nSurround yourself with trustworthy, supportive friends. Jettison any victim-blaming binlids. The twazzock who texted you and accused you of being cruel to your stalker can get in the sea: he is not your friend.\n\nBecause your parents are not supportive, they may end up placing you in greater danger. If you have a good relationship with your parents, try sitting them down and explaining that you are not flattered, you are scared, upset and freaked out. Use words like 'sexual harassment' and 'stalking', this kind of strong language might shock some sense into them.\n\nIf your parents remain unsupportive, then assume they are a risk to you. Do not underestimate how dangerous this kind of stalker-apologism is. Prepare an escape strategy, including a ready supply of cash in an acount they can't access, your important documents and sentimental items in a packed bag stashed in an easy-to-grab spot, and an address you can run to where your parents won't be able to find you for a day or two.\n\nI don't know how your school system works, but they need to be involved. Go back to the Dean and this time, kick up a huge fuss. Use words like 'sexual harassment' and threaten to get the police involved.\n\nYou are NTA, but that's no longer important. Being safe is more important than being nice. Stop worrying about being an AH, and start worrying about your safety.\n\nGood luck and God protect you, we're all hoping this will be safely resolved.", "Yep. You didn't escalate it until she did.

It\u2019s also not cool that your parents are invalidating your feelings about it being creepy. I\u2019m sure your parents are lovely but sometimes (I fear especially with guys), parents can be \u201cin my day\u201d minded, and they really lose sight of and confuse what is OKAY, with what was ACCEPTED back in their day.

It also might be why your friend texted you in the way she did. The comments you made were straight up not nice. And PLEASE hear me out bc, it can affect you too. I get that you are creeped out by her and rightfully so, and her actions are NOT okay. That being said, by having reactions that are mean towards someone that is clearly TOO fond of you, you can kinda shoot yourself in the foot. \n\nI had a similar situation in school and at first I was nice to this person bc I thought he was just weird and I didn\u2019t want to be mean. But he made me uncomfortable, and was stalker like as well. I definitely got more support than you\u2019re experiencing (potentially bc I was a girl dealing with a guy and people tend to unfairly judge the opposite still), but eventually I would say things on the meaner side to this guy when he would interact. I believe now that it was kinda my subconscious effort to show that I was strong and wouldn\u2019t put up with shit once I realized he was a threat, not just an awkward kid that liked me (and you have the tumblr thing too, I didn\u2019t have anything like that, so yours is even more stalker-y than mine was). \n\nAnyway, people would see this behavior from me and would either chastise him (like most of your friends did) which at the time seemed productive to me. But in reality it made a situation where I was in danger LOOK like a mean girl situation. It ended up putting me at further risk. I wasn\u2019t a bully but I looked like one (towards him) if you didn\u2019t know the details. It made it a lot harder to get people that could help, on my side. That logic your parents have? About how you should be flattered?? Adults were telling me that, and when he would offer gifts, they\u2019d consider him harmless. \n\nAnd honestly I didn\u2019t realize it at the time but as a senior in HS I was coming out of my ugly duckling phase where I thought I was still awkward looking but to others, I was actually a pretty girl. So teachers and faculty would tell me things like the occasional \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t mind it if you found him handsome/cute/cool\u201d,  and thought it was just a nerdy or awkward kid, dealing with a pretty girl who was mean and wanted nothing to do with him, rather than recognizing him as a threat. It allowed him to look like a victim and go unaddressed by adults around me. And it also made him lowkey angry bc HE felt as though he was being bullied by me when he \u201cjust liked me\u201d (doing drive bys of my house and following me places with my friends, and magically showing up places where I am, coming to my job, is NOT okay). \n\nSo basically I was in more danger bc now this kid was getting the mean girl treatment (albeit as a defense from me, just like yours), and getting angry about it, but also  I wasn\u2019t getting help from adults at school, AND them not helping me, fueled him in thinking he wasn\u2019t at fault, and that what he was doing was okay. I just wouldn\u2019t want the same for you and it really honestly does make the situation more potentially dangerous for you to have reactions like that. You can ofc let her know you\u2019re not interested, and vocalize that, but I would keep it at stern, not name calling. \n\nOther people on here have mentioned that she probably has some mental struggles and she most likely does. That doesn\u2019t make her actions any better or \u2018okay\u2019 by any means, but the words can affect that too as well. Which can do further damage to her, but also to you if you\u2019re insulting someone who doesn\u2019t have awareness or control of their own mental faculties. \n\nMy advice? Be stern, make it clear you\u2019re not interested, and ask that of your friends as well. Things like \u201clisten this isn\u2019t cool, he said he is not interested and you\u2019re disrespecting his personal space and requests\u201d WITHOUT mocking or laughing, while it may feel silly at the time or \u201csoft\u201d, will really be more effective; and although you should already be receiving support, you are not, and this approach is a more effective way to have the people around you realize that she is the aggressor, and that you are not being mean, you are being harassed. It\u2019s easier to back you and easier to garner support. Also like a lot of other commenters are saying, keep a record of all of your odd interactions. Maybe screenshots of any odd activity, her tumblr posts with your face, write a note in your phone of any interactions, who was around, date/time, what transpired. If she contacts you, keep records of those interactions as well. Notes on things like you mentioned about her being in your lunch period when she\u2019s supposed to be in your friend\u2019s class. It sounds like a lot but this is how you collect evidence for a stalker situation.\n\nAnd I would absolutely have a convo with the friend that texted you and have a convo with her kinda explaining that while this girls intentions could be harmless, (like they seem very fan-girly, horse girl, boy band enthusiast level stuff *super common, I\u2019ve been there* but pal you are NOT Harry Styles or a backstreet boy, it\u2019s not normal to stalk real people the way it\u2019s become acceptable towards celebs, and making edits is in the same vein as that), HOWEVER it doesn\u2019t matter her intention. What she is doing is unacceptable. What she\u2019s doing is stalker like for sure. Hopefully when this is handled, she can realize that and stop. But nobody should be minimizing it just bc she is doing \u201cnice\u201d things for you rn. And it\u2019s worth pointing out to your friend that texted you bc it sounds like her heart is in the right place but she\u2019s missing that this is harassment and it would be a learning opportunity. Might even be worth saying so she doesn\u2019t ever find herself in a situation where she\u2019s enabling herself or her other friends to be harassed either.", "NTA. Ask your female friend how see would feel if the situation was reversed? You\u2019ve done all the right things, you are not obligated to be kind to your stalker, because she is a stalker. Report her to the police because you may be her first, but you won\u2019t be her last.", "YTA. This girl is obviously special. Just let her have a crush on you. If you wake up in the middle of the night tied up, then you probably should have done something else more drastic.", "NTA that's pretty much stalking and yep sound creepy", "He is reporting her because he is being harassed by this girl.\n\nShe\u2019s 18, she should already know the basics. At the very least, she knows the word STOP and the word NO \n\nIf half of his friend group is upset with him, I\u2019m going to take a not so wild guess that this girl has a known developmental and/or other disability of some kind. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is harassing him and stalking him. If she does have a disability, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the special education staff aren\u2019t stepping in, and I would be even less surprised if someone at the school or in her family are encouraging this behavior.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry OP. NTA", "We'll be here a-hwile", "That's BS, I live in Massachusetts and you can get a restraining order for a stalker & Internet stalking has its own set of laws!", "Stalking and internet stalking have thier own charges. You can get a restraining order, based on the relationship of the stalker, or an anti-harrassment order (which has the same conditions of a restraining order) for someone who does not meet the requirements of a restraining order. The judge can also grant a stay-away order as part of the conditions of release for someone who is charged with stalking.", "I think there's some consideration for not escalating verbally when she's clearly unstable. Not for her benefit, but for his. I agree absolutely with his refusal to take the gift, but I would stop conversing with her in any way. Even negative conversations she can remake into couple's spats in her delusion, which will only deepen her conviction they're in a relationship. \n\nAs many other comments have said, he needs to focus on getting the admin to take this seriously. And/or report to the cops.", "There's this scene in one hentai where she uses a certain white thing of hers in a cookie", "I can\u2019t believe his parents. WTF IS WRONG WITH THEM and the school. I hope one adult helps him.", "Well I don't think OP should be involved in any way with talking to her parents, they've obviously dropped a ball or two along the parenting journey. OP is a VERY young adult and the police will be better at acting as go-betweens.", "We are talking about thise closets to him like his mates and parents. 100% his parents wouldn't tell him to he flattered if it was their daughter being stalked and hatrased. I've personally been told I'm lying about a guy trying to rape me so I get it but men often don't come forward because they \"should be flattered\" or \"men can't be raped\" ect. Men get laughed at almost every time where for us woman it's honestly a 50/50 if we get believed and the right support. There are far more support systems in place for woman then men. In the end no one deserves it and we need to be doing better to protect all victims regardless of gender, age, beliefs, culture ect.", "She was one of the loveliest people I had the privilege to teach over a 34-year career.  She\u2019s been gone almost 20 years and I still think about her.  I have no idea what kind of sentence the guy who killed her got, but I hope he\u2019s never seen the outside again.", "There are more in place specifically because women have advocated and started these groups because it is so prevalent for women. And you can\u2019t be so sure about people supporting their daughters. Plenty of parents, especially religious ones, would and do find ways to blame their daughters.", "Oh there is an anime that's much worse. Lolol but good anime \"in a world where dirty words are illegal\" or something like that.", "Please convey my sincerest apologies to your cat XD", "coffee coated is also an accurate description", "If she can't take a joke.....eff her lmao\n\nJk i love my kitty, and she accepts!!", "Lol! Itc, she's probably just hoping it's a latte next time.\n\nBut for real...\"stalker cupcakes\" is not a phrase I ever could have predicted or imagined without this wtfdidIjustread for inspiration. Glad you got some laughs from it."]}
