I know, because so do I.\nThird, and this is where I\u2019m gonna need you to set aside your self-concern and listen to me for a sec, this girl is being abused.\nNot every person with BPD has been abused as a child. Some were \u201conly\u201d emotionally abused or neglected.\nHowever, the behavior you\u2019re describing, particularly her obvious shame about it\u2014so she clearly knows her behavior is socially unacceptable, but she can\u2019t stop herself\u2014yeah. Someone is abusing this girl. \nShe needs help.\nNot as in, \u201cshe needs help to not do this.\u201d\nI mean, yeah. But mostly? She needs HELP.\nShe needs your HELP.\nScrew your school. Go tell the police what\u2019s happening. Make them listen to you. Tell them she\u2019s acting weird. Say the words \u201cunstable,\u201d \u201chysterical,\u201d \u201cemotional wreck,\u201d \u201cobsessed,\u201d and tell them you think there\u2019s something wrong with her that her parents won\u2019t fix.

You need help and it sounds like shoes does as well.", "You should probably consider talking to the cops with what you have. They won't do anything BUT try to have an official record of the complain and record everything she does.\nI don't know what her problem is (mental, behavioral, etc) but she is escalating and she sounds like a stalker. \n\nNTA for what you said, you could have handled it more tactfully though. \n\nBut please, report it to someone.", "NTA she's literally your stalker take a restraining order out on her before it escalates more.", "NTA-she was literally harassing you in every way possible, yes, including sexual. and honestly, you made the right choice, she definitely gives off \"date rape in food/drink and you wake up tied to a bed in her basement where she forces you to have sex with her\" vibes. those cupcakes were definitely drugged or maybe she took a page from Midsomer and put her period blood and pubes in them.  very creepy and it's best if you have contacting the police as an option and try as much as possible to get evidence of what she's doing. the adults in your life aren't doing shit and that's just sad.", "NTA.  You don't know what she may have done to, or put into, those cupcakes.  You were right to throw them out. And, she was stalking and harassing you. It is creepy.", "NTA \u2014\u2014 I\u2019m sure someone else could give you better advice and more in depth but she is stalking you and you should report this to the police. \n\nAlso, Report it to your school counselor or advisor, whatever you have at your school who is not the dean. Teachers. As many people as possible.", "Obviously, you could have stated it better, but this girl was sexually harassing you. She was **stalking** you. The behavior you describe is practically the textbook definition. Prior to this incident, you had repeatedly told her that she was making you uncomfortable and that you wanted her to stop following you around. NTA.", "NTA. She is clearly stalking you. You could honestly get a restraining order if you need one", "She is legally an adult, as are you.  File a police report and get a restraining order.  Don\u2019t accept any gifts from her, report her to all your social media, and file a formal complaint with your school\u2019s Board of Education.  NTA.\n\nEdited to add, that you should keep and file any text messages from her as well as screenshots of her tumbler pages, these can be used as evidence to establish a behavior pattern of unwanted contact.", "NTA. I mean, it sucks that it had to get to this point, but it sounds like your school not doing shit really left you no choice. You've blocked her, avoided her, and she still keeps doing this kind of thing, so eventually there's no option left but to go nuclear", "NTA and once again nobody gives a crap about male sexual harassment.", "When you threw her gift in the garbage, it may have triggered her into hate mode. It may cause the stalking to turn into vengeance.", "NTA at all. Can you talk to an another adult who is more useful than your negligent parents and dean?", "nta, she\u2019s been stalking and harassing you. if you can prove that account is owned by her and you have witnesses to her behavior, you have a case to even try to get a protection order.\nbased on what you\u2019ve said abt her behavior, when you said she gave you baked goods, i was really worried she put something in them (not necessary drugs or stuff like that, but anything weird, i could just be paranoid though lol)", "This is beyond creepy and technically stalking. Get legal help now.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Someone needs to take her actions serious before something far more serious happens, with you or a future object of her obsessive delusions.", "Your reaction was extreme, but her behavior is also extreme. I\u2019d say obsessive. You\u2019ve made it clear that you didn\u2019t want her to keep pursuing you and she couldn\u2019t respect that. Harsh, but NTA.", "NTA \nTo state the obvious here, if you were doing this to her the dean would be all over you. This is still sexual harassment and you need to find an adult who will advocate for you. Good luck", "NTA. You tried more mundane methods in the past and they didnt work. Sometimes you have to do something extreme in order for someone to get the message. It really sucks that no adult is helping your situation, as it never shouldve even gotten this far.", "NTA - You're being harassed and stalked. It absolutely sucks no one around you is taking it seriously. \n\nShe's crossed the line numerous times, it's not just an innocent crush from someone lacking social skills.\n\nYou deserve better friends and your parents and dean need to wake up.", "With context nta .but I am concerned with her behavior that she could escalate. Her behavior is stalkerish and signs of significant mental health issues. (Yes your behavior was mean on a surface level, but that's not really important, and is really an under reaction... because she is stalking you and being a total creeper). Find a trusted teacher and tell them you are being sexually harassed repeatedly And it's starting to get creepy... Because omg it is a big red flag.", "NTA. Holy shit. File a police report. This is super creepy.  And I feel like the response you're getting from adults in your life is straight up sexist. If the gender rules were reversed, 100% their response would be different.", "NTA if the genders were reversed I doubt there would be so much inactivity from the adults. \n\nI would go to the Dean again and tell him, when he inevitably does nothing go to the cops and report her for harassment show them the DMs and the tumblr page, they probably can't do much but start a paper trail. Then I would take the report to the school and turn it in so they \"have it on file should she choose to keep up with the harassment.\".", "NTA. I feel sorry for the girl, but she is basically stalking you. Sounds like she really needs some help.", "Do you have a teacher you could talk to? You weren't kind in the moment, but I definitely understand why. The situation needs to be addressed by and adult. No one should be taking and posting pictures of you without your consent. NTA", "NTA. She's been sexually harassing you for months. Asking her to stop many times didn't work, so now you're escalating. Good for you.", "Nta you should honestly take all the dms and tumbler to the cops", "Obviously, you could have stated it better, but this girl was sexually harassing you. She was **stalking** you. The behavior you describe is practically the textbook definition. Prior to this incident, you had repeatedly told her that she was making you uncomfortable and that you wanted her to stop following you around. NTA.", "Make a report to the local police.  Ask for a restraining order against this female.  Under no circumstances allow her to talk to you again.  If you see her, leave.  If you can't leave, say clearly and loudly, 'stay away from me'.  Do whatever you must.", "Lol & so do I but that doesn\u2019t make me think I\u2019m qualified to diagnose someone & their home life over the internet. Holy shit.", "I hate being this guy but reverse the genders in this situation and tell me if you would give this same advice\n\nThe reality is even if everything your saying is true about her it is not his job to care for the person that has been stalking and harassing him for a year", "Definitely get screenshots, op!", "And how did you reach that conclusion?", "Would her actions be considered illegal? And is there a legitimate chance she actually would be punished?", "That would be the part of the Dean taking no action and OPs parents not being concerned. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Yes two unwanted contacts is legally stalking if you are in the US ask for a restraining order", "It depends where you live. Where I live, in Chicago, in the US, it definitely would be.\n\nIs there a teacher that you can go to and explain that you are being \"sexually harassed\" and that the dean is not helping? If it's a public school in the US, can you go to the school board? I'm sorry that your parents aren't helping you. you have the right to go to school free of harassment.", "Yes. Stalking is viable for punishment. Especially if you have proof. SS fast and best of luck, OP.", "OP, document everything. Screenshot all DMs + the tumblr pages. Make sure your friends to back up your side if this becomes a legal issue. Complain to campus security, whatever student affairs Centre takes care of stuff like this kn your campus and the Dean *in writing* to make sure you gave proof of submitting a harassment complaint and they didn't follow up. After that, file a complaint with the police and if all of that comes to nothing, it's time to get a lawyer involved. She's stalking you and it's not harmless or funny. She needs to stop.", "Yep.", "Exactly, make sure to have copies of everything."]}
