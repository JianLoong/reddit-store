If saying that is what finally causes her to stop stalking you then good on you. My question is why are all the other adults completely underreacting? Id suggest bringing up if your genders were reversed if theyd feel differently, and pointing out a woman is just as capable of obtaining a weapon and harming you... whos to say she wont stop and escalate her behaviour... im genuinely concerned for you.", "NTA. This girl is harassing you and your school should deal with it. Report her and your negligent dean to the principal. She should leave you alone if you tell her to.

Your reaction is justified. This has been going on too long. Especially if you have told her and reported her, it isn't funny, and it is scary. Most stalkers are men, so the research about women stalkers is not as extensive, and the behaviors and escalations do differ. It is possible that this type of emotional confrontation is what will make her stop. I hope that is the case. Keep all the information you have, any evidence, screen shots, or anything. You may need it because it could also go the other way, and the escalation could be worse than what she has been doing. It could turn violent.", "Go to the police, it's stalking, harrassment and putting your photos on the internet without your consent", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely take this further to cover yourself.\n\nAs for the friend who said your reaction was extremely cruel, ask him how he would feel if he was the object of her obsession?

You deserve to be taken seriously and she needs to stop", "NTA\n\nI'm your parents age, and I handled a similar situation much, much differently. There was a chick in my Freshman cooking class that I had never seen before. She was way out of my league in the looks department, like 8/10, but was a total nutbucket. Never spoke to anyone, just stared at me all the time unless I happened to look up. Then she would look away. I mean I could feel her eyes boring holes into my fucking head from across the room. I played it cool and kept my distance the entire semester. She wasn't there our tenth grade year but came back our Junior year. By that point, I had refined my game quite a bit, and that kind of attention towards me was all I needed for the sharkfin to be cresting the water (Cue Jaws theme).\n\nShe was back to her old tricks of eye-fucking me from afar. I made my move on her after breaking up with my then-girlfriend. It was a quiet pump and dump situation before it even got all that far. Banged her a few times on the QT and then set her adrift. Once I did that, I knew she would never want to see me again and I went back to my girlfriend a couple weeks later, who was never the wiser.  \n\nActually, I pulled that one twice during that relationship. I'd find someone I wanted to fuck, break up and do it. Then go back. I was kind of a scumbag back then, though, so don't do that sort of thing.", "NTA she is creepy but I don\u2019t like the word bitch tbh\n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong here though I just don\u2019t appreciate that language", "You need to talk to your parents, again.

Definitely document everything. Get a restraining order if you fear sexual assault, violent actions, or worse. I do think she is being very creepy and clearly cannot take a hint.

I woulda went for her throat.", "NTA", "NTA. You don't have to be nice to anyone exhibiting this type of behavior. You did the right thing by dumping the cupcakes. Hopefully the humiliation she experienced will be a deterrent.", "I was about to call you out for being mean but then I read the whole thing... You've rejected her multiple times in a less rude way.  I think your response was appropriate, although I wouldn't have personally called her a bitch, creepy is absolutely justified!\n\nIf you were female and it were a guy secretly photographing you, I think you'd have a lot more sympathy than you're getting now.\n\nPeople are being sexist; this girl is a fucking stalker.

Creepy and illegal. You've made it clear you're not interested and someone is stalking you. You're not an asshole for reacting negatively to someone who is stalking you and making you uncomfortable. The authority figurese in your life are just appalling, this should have been nipped in the bud ages ago. I wonder how many other kids are being stalked in  your school because people think it's, \"cute\", and they \"should be flattered\"?

I bet your friend would take it more serif you were female and being stalked by a male. So NTA.", "I see how you finally had enough. NTA", "NTA this is stalking and harassment, this is a legal matter, and I'm sorry your school and parents aren't taking it seriously.", "NTA.

Your parent's argument, and if I were you, I'd mention this too, is the same as telling a male victim of rape that he's a guy and he clearly enjoyed it because he had an erection. (Physical responses aren't always controllable, so fuck that noise) You being a guy and her being a girl doesn't make it flattered. You shouldn't be flattered. You should be creeped out. You are. She needs to be told by an authority figure to stop. And your parents need to have your back. That's pissing me off.", "NTA. And you report her to the police.

But she should be seen as a potential victim of mental illness.\n     You should be worried about what she might do to herself because often times these people that stalk are often suicidal.

I needed people to literally surround me at lunch so he wouldn't force himself next to me and he would still sit nearby and stare at me all lunch. after weeks of this and teachers not really seeing a problem (not even the one who let me hide in his classroom during lunch), I went to the school administration\n\nthey told me that I should be nicer to the boy. the vice principal told me that the boy didn't have many friends and he just looked up to me and he wasn't doing anything harmful and why couldn't I be nicer and more understanding of him. while he had the support of the administration and teachers, at least didn't have social support because he was considered a \"weird loser.\" he wasn't thought of that way because he harassed me, or because of the other people he had harassed. but because he was disabled and considered unattractive \n\nthe second time someone started harassing me in school and stalking me....

He's a victim of constant creepy harassment, OF COURSE its about him! . If this was reversed and she was being stalked you'd change your tune.", "Not his job to get her help or treat her", "Yes, because it\u2019s OP\u2019s job to help the person creeping him out. Makes perfect sense.", ">:if you would stop the me me me crap, you would probably be able to see that she needs help because she shouldn\u2019t be acting irrational\n\nThis is about him, he's the victim. If she needs help that's on her, not on him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You should\u2019ve gotten help for her sooner than this. She shouldn\u2019t be made a criminal because she\u2019s ill.\n\nOnce again it was never his responsibility to get her help, and she's by law a criminal regardless of her mental state. Claiming he should be the one to get her help is the most outlandish take I've ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You should be worried about what she might do to herself because often times these people that stalk are often suicidal. Which would make you TA should she committed suicide\n\nThis right here takes the cake, every piece of it. He's the victim og a creepy stalker and what do you do? You pin the blame for the stalkers potential suicide on the victim of said stalker. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There\u2019s more to life than just I\u2019m a victim. It is your job if you want to make her quit and make her pay.\n\nSo it's the victims responsibility to make sure the stalker stops? What world are you living in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour comment is vile, and you should definitely be ashamed of yourself for trying to pin all the blame on OP-", "The fact that you are the mother of a little boy is absolutely terrifying. And I truly mean that. Reading this comment and seeing that you have a young son honestly makes me extremely worried for him. How on earth will you react if a women stalks, abuses or rapes him in the future?", "Not cruel and heartless if he\u2019s already, multiple times, asked her stop.", "NO MEANS NO! Consent matters", "No tff she does NOT need sympathy. You wouldn't say that genders reversed. This is gross harassment !", "Nah, stalkers deserve to be treated poorly. This was entirely within acceptable bounds for how to treat a stalker, the only concern is if she escalates, not her feelings.", "Why are you trying to act like its OP\u2019s responsibility to get this girl help? She\u2019s harassing him and who knows how this could turn out.", "Reverse the genders and you'd believe every word of it I guarantee, leave your bias at the door.", "It\u2019s not OPs job to do anything other than report the behavior and if those in charge are not taking him seriously he is well within his right to go to the police about it. No one should have to suffer in a place that should be considered safe.", "People really aren't responsible for solving the problems of people harassing them. Its good to help others but come on the last people you should be trying to make feel responsible for it are their targets", "Dude get a restraining/protection order this is disturbing as HELL. This Isnt a cute little crush, this is how stalkers end up finding your house and climbing in your window to watch you when you're asleep. You being a guy doesnt make it any different , this is harassment and your parents/friends suck major ass for those reactions", "Don\u2019t forget the ongoing sexual harassment/online sexual harassment and stalking. None of this is okay and if we reverse the gender roles we would question what exactly was in those cupcakes and shame the person heavily", "Not your fault but I gotta say, this just sounds like the beginning of her supervillain story...or maybe it's just me. Like something straight out of a cartoon, like Powerpuff Girls. \"He threw my cupcakes in the garbage, now he must paaaaaaay!! *lightning strikes in the background*\"", "NTA sometimes it takes an action like that for someone to get it what she is doing is stalking you and sexually harassing you who know what she could do there are many crazy stories about things and situations like this with not very good endings she sounds unstable and may have mental issues which can be dangerous I would definitely recommend getting a restraining order against her and contacting the police with all the evidence you have plus the witnesses you could be in danger I\u2019m not try to scare you but just make you aware this sounds like she is obsessed with you which isn\u2019t healthy at all please be careful", "Ask that friend of yours if she thinks the same if a guy treated her the same way too.", "Actually punished is not likely. Scared enough to stop? Probably. Important enough for your Dean to take it seriously? Yes.\n\nGo in with an adult (older adult) you trust, so they can help make sure the police takes you seriously.", "Yes. What she is doing is illegal. And should be reported. She needs to learn that these behaviours are not acceptable.", "Yes, she\u2019s stalking you. It would be quite easy to get a restraining order against her. And if she violates that in any way, she risks being arrested. \n\nYou should also bring this up to other adults at your school. The school should absolutely step up when one of its students is stalking another.", "Yes- and just try to think if the genders were reversed and it was some dude posting edited \u2018couple\u2019 pics of someone and sending their creepy fantasies it wouldn\u2019t even be a question. She\u2019s stalking you. \n\nWomen can be creeps too. Women can be dangerous too. Hopefully you calling her out this time will be enough. If it\u2019s not tell her you\u2019ll get a restraining order.", "Yes! \n\nLegal definitions of stalking differ depending on where you live; however stalking is a crime under the laws of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Territories, and the Federal government. Stalking is serious, often violent, and can escalate over time.\n\nI made a comment about it, there is a number in the US which you can call to get guidance in the subject before going to the police if you want:  National Center for Victims of Crime at 1-855-4-VICTIM (1-855-484-2846).\n\nHope this helps.", "When I worked in the mall, a guy I was not interested in kept sending me flowers.  If I was there I refused delivery since if I wasn\u2019t willing to spend time with him it was inappropriate to accept any gifts.  This still led to an unpleasant meeting with my manager over a guy whose only interaction with me ever was literally 5 minutes in that store.  That was more than 30 years ago.  Your folks and the school need to have your back.  NTA", "How did you resolve both of your stalkers? I'm sitting on the edge here!\n\nMy daughter, whom avoids social media, had someone post a video of her not standing for the pledge of allegiance on social media and fortunately the administration took her side and made him delete the video. We've had to be hyper-vigilant since then and it sucks.", "It could be pretty uncomfortable / dangerous if he would give her sympathy, it just means that she is not \"evil\" and he needs to understand that she probably won't act rational, so that the usual \"talk to her, comunicate\" probably won't work.", "Her delusions If that may worsen the situation or alter any charges if she is eligible for intervention of some kind. I just don't have memory of these cases being treated seriously if no actual harm has been done or threat seen.", "Dude didn't say to give her sympathy because of it. Looks more like an elaboration on why he should be concerned she could escalate it.", "His parents and friends laughed at him dude...", "She might not be able to know what she\u2019s doing. Otherwise she would stop. We don\u2019t know what is going on in there even if it is creepy. What is so wrong with trying to get people to understand that something isn\u2019t right about her? Yes I had a guy get creepy with me like this boy is getting it but I got his attention and he quit but he understood what I said and what I was capable of doing. It\u2019s evident that she doesn\u2019t and she needs help before someone really stops her or she commits suicide.", "Is the Stalker\u2019s Reddit account", "Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t trust stalker cupcakes enough eat them. Nor let anyone else eat them. Into the bin they go.\n\nAnd considering how many times he\u2019s told her no, she has no claim to a sensitive or diplomatic response. Yeah, it was a bit savage to chuck them in front of her\u2026and that savagery was earned.", "Isn't that Harassment not stalking? \n\nWhat the girl doing is stalking, for sure, but the two unwanted contacts sounds way closer to Harassment.", "Not everywhere in the US.", "Yeah but despite all the crazy movies out there, it\u2019s VERY rare for a female to actually do something like that to a male.   Men are much more likely to commit that sort of abusive violence.  \n\nNTA, OP.  I would definitely document everything.   If you are seriously concerned for your safety, report it.", "You mean like Megs hair pie she fed Brian? \n\nI can't stop laughing while also being skeeved to hell and back.", "I have seen watch mojos of that anime", "The amount of excuses people on this subreddit goes to excuses women fuck up is insane. \nAssholes don't have gender.", "\"She's a teenager\" isn't an adequate excuse especially given she is of legal age to be dealt with as an adult. She is more than old enough to know what she is doing is wrong.\n\nUnless she has a diagnosis from doctor or medical professional you can't excuse her behaviour by assuming she has a mental disorder. This is an insult to those who actually have mental conditions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> She brought him cupcakes, she didn\u2019t attack him.\n\nDid you read the actual post or a fantasy post where you ignored anything that made her look bad?\n\nOP told her not to talk to him or interact with him. She is targetting him because she is cutting class to follow him. \n\nShe needs to know that punishments exist for this behaviour. If she gets a diagnosis for a disorder then she also needs professional help for that. Until you know she does you should stop using it as an excuse. \n\nYou should really take a look in the mirror and ask yourself if you would defend male stalkers in this manner and how your inability to hold AH women accountable is affecting you.", "Looks like my report worked lmao", "You're a dumbass. OP just did what you described, he let the creepy stalker know they're being creepy. Trying to pin her \"potential suicide\" as his fault is pathetic, and you should be ashamed of yourself.", "You absolute donut more worried about the stalker rather than the victim who's being blamed and told to like attention from girls he doesn't want any part in. Her own mental health is hers to take care of and op just wants to be left alone. This is no different than saying \"She wore a short skirt so she wanted it\". No means NO! Learn consent", "It's like you're saying this girl is dumb and brainless therefore she cannot be held accountable for her own actions. That's sexist.\nThis shouldn't be OP's problem. He already told her NO! She needs to get her crap together and grow up and back off. Life isn't a fucking rom-com.\n\nEditing to add: Stop making excuses for this type of behavior and to throw the threat of suicide in this makes your comment even worse.", "Have you ever seen the docuseries I Am A Stalker? Because if you have, you would see that engaging with them just eggs them on. The fact that you\u2019re victim blaming this guy and expecting him to bear the responsibility of helping his HARASSER is disturbing af. Oh and of course he\u2019s worried about himself only because he\u2019s being fucking stalked and no one is helping him stop her. Bottom line is that it not the victim\u2019s responsibility to \u201cfix\u201d the attacker.", ">Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t trust stalker cupcakes enough eat them.\n\nI just died reading this line.

Male domestic violence victims etc are never taken seriously", "Yeah, me too. <dry heaves>", "They said not everywhere in the US, as in different states have different rules...\nGenius.", "Re read their comment genius", "yeah not only is the fact that it's a female perpetrator and a male victim that's an issue here, but unless her stalking escalates to something actually illegal or violent, there's very little cops will do about it. stalking is one of those crimes where everyone knows where it leads but until it crosses a line law enforcement doesn't have much standing to do anything against the stalker even if they wanted to.\n\nunfortunately op's best bet is to try to get the school to intervene again. maybe try to get a teacher he trusts or a counselor involved. a little social media public shaming tends to get things moving.", "The dean being useless isn't surprising but a counselor, or someone else in the district might be more able hopefully. His parents are disgusting for the idea that it's flattering that a girl is stalking him too, holy fuck."]}
