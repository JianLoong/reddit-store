Your reaction is justified. This has been going on too long. Especially if you have told her and reported her, it isn't funny, and it is scary. Most stalkers are men, so the research about women stalkers is not as extensive, and the behaviors and escalations do differ. It is possible that this type of emotional confrontation is what will make her stop. I hope that is the case. Keep all the information you have, any evidence, screen shots, or anything.

There was a chick in my Freshman cooking class that I had never seen before. She was way out of my league in the looks department, like 8/10, but was a total nutbucket. Never spoke to anyone, just stared at me all the time unless I happened to look up. Then she would look away. I mean I could feel her eyes boring holes into my fucking head from across the room. I played it cool and kept my distance the entire semester. She wasn't there our tenth grade year but came back our Junior year. By that point, I had refined my game quite a bit, and that kind of attention towards me was all I needed for the sharkfin to be cresting the water (Cue Jaws theme).\n\nShe was back to her old tricks of eye-fucking me from afar. I made my move on her after breaking up with my then-girlfriend. It was a quiet pump and dump situation before it even got all that far. Banged her a few times on the QT and then set her adrift. Once I did that, I knew she would never want to see me again and I went back to my girlfriend a couple weeks later, who was never the wiser.  \n\nActually, I pulled that one twice during that relationship. I'd find someone I wanted to fuck, break up and do it. Then go back.

Your parent's argument, and if I were you, I'd mention this too, is the same as telling a male victim of rape that he's a guy and he clearly enjoyed it because he had an erection. (Physical responses aren't always controllable, so fuck that noise) You being a guy and her being a girl doesn't make it flattered. You shouldn't be flattered. You should be creeped out. You are.

I needed people to literally surround me at lunch so he wouldn't force himself next to me and he would still sit nearby and stare at me all lunch. after weeks of this and teachers not really seeing a problem (not even the one who let me hide in his classroom during lunch), I went to the school administration\n\nthey told me that I should be nicer to the boy. the vice principal told me that the boy didn't have many friends and he just looked up to me and he wasn't doing anything harmful and why couldn't I be nicer and more understanding of him. while he had the support of the administration and teachers, at least didn't have social support because he was considered a \"weird loser.\" he wasn't thought of that way because he harassed me, or because of the other people he had harassed. but because he was disabled and considered unattractive \n\nthe second time someone started harassing me in school and stalking me.... I simply didn't go to anyone for help. and this person was popular. and I'd dated him. and both of those things made it harder for me to find anyone to take my side.

I figured he'd move on and not retaliate because I'd gotten him to dump me and it had been his own idea.... but as soon I was back in school he started stalking me. he was popular so a bunch of my friends and classmates didn't see a problem because I was the bitch for breaking his heart (even though again, he had dumped me). hell he even would stand outside where I lived and knock on the windows and my sister didn't see this as scary and fucked up, but would answer and talk to him about me despite the fact that I had made it very clear that I didn't want to see him or talk to him or have anyone tell him anything about me\n\npeople are not very good at respecting other people's boundaries, and especially especially as if it's inconvenient for them, or they don't understand or agree with your choices\n\ncreepy people are often given free license to operate. they don't get expelled from social circles and instead, their victims work around them. avoid places that they'll be, avoid being alone with them, etc. and if you stand up for yourself, people will often have an issue with that and exclude you for defending your own boundaries\n\nhell it's incredibly common for rape victims to get dumped by their friends group because the group doesn't want to dump the rapist and gets made because they're being forced to choose   \n\nthere is an enormous number of people in the world who would much rather you be uncomfortable quietly then expect them to do anything that makes them uncomfortable  \n\nand in this case, it's very easy for this to get twisted against you. \"she just gave him a present and he freaked out and threw it away and was so rude and called her names\"  \n\nseriously, go get a restraining order. she doesn't respect a no and is very obsessed with you and this could easily turn dangerous. even if it never does, you deserve not to be stalked and harassed. and yeah your school should be protecting you from that and your classmates and peers should too. but they will respect a piece of paper from the court hell of a lot more than anything you say to them. and in the case of the school they're legally compelled to enforce the order  \n\nif you want to think about it and not do it right away.... at the very least document everything. save every message and post and phone records and write down dates and times of day and notes if she does something in person.", "This! It\u2019s unfortunately unlikely anything will come of it, they generally won\u2019t do anything without specific threat of harm (and not even that sometimes). But, you need to start legally documenting this. Bring the screenshots, take notes of dates and specific interactions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t normal, and I\u2019m so sorry your school is failing you. Is there someone at the school you can escalate to? A parent or older adult that can help advocate for you? \n\nNTA at all, and I\u2019m so sorry anyone ever made you feel like you were.", "Yup it's absolutely sexist. \n\nThis is the f'ed up otherside of the sexual harassment coin. Women \"deserve it\" for having a body, and men should be appreciating it because it's flattering. God I hate it.", "Giving zero fucks about sexual harassment from women is its own form of misogyny and presents the shitty argument that women don\u2019t have the capacity to be bad, dangerous, or malicious. It\u2019s infantilizing towards women and harmful to anyone (such as OP) who is being sexually harassed by a woman.\n\nOP is NTA. This girl clearly is in the wrong here. It\u2019s incredibly messed up that OP\u2019s parents and dean aren\u2019t taking this seriously.", "What an abhorrent comment and take. How do you know she has BPD? How do you know she is being abused? You are being extremely rude to those who have been abused or do suffer from BPD by using those terms as a way to reduce the accountability of this sexual stalker.\n\nDo you really think that the only way a woman can be a sexual harasser is if she has a mental condition? You don't think that just like every other human, that there are women who could do this? Women who could do this **who do this on purpose. With agency?**\n\nYour take is a prime example of what is wrong with this subreddit and its shocking inability to hold AH women to account", "You don\u2019t have right to privacy in public.

I'm not saying fighting fire with fire is always the right answer, but BIG yikes accusing a victim for defending themselves.", "Congratulations, you\u2019re blaming a victim of harassment and stalking for defending themselves.", "Yes. She's harassing you. You've warned her to leave you alone, she hasn't. \n\nHonestly, dumping the cupcakes was not so cruel considering she otherwise wasnt taking the very obvious hint. \n\nIt's not like you were doing it to be mean either, but rather out of frustration. \n\nI think taking it up with your teachers and counselor is in order.", "It should, but unfortunately sometimes police don\u2019t take these things seriously and it sucks (I\u2019ve heard horror stories from men and women who\u2019s been stalked)", "Definitely stalking and harassment at this point. The falsified images of y'all as a couple could be slander as well.", "It's probably enough to be considered stalking, doesn't hurt to ask. The cops will know if they can pursue a case or not. Reporting it to them will establish a paper trail if nothing else in case this escalates at some point.", "The cops are not going to take this seriously because of sexism.  Hopefully calling her a creepy bitch finally got her to see reality", "ya... I'm sure they were spiked with something of hers. barf", "The South Park episode where Kyle's little brother is molested by his teacher is like shockingly accurate to what this poor OP is experiencing.\n\nIt's so gross.

It\u2019s infantilizing towards women and   \nharmful to anyone\n\nWelcome to AITA.\n\nThis sub infantilise AH women all the time if it means they can reduce the blame on them. \n\nEver seen a husband come here about a wife who doesn't contribute to the household? Wait 10min and count the comments that diagnose her with ADHD, PPD, BPD and then call him an AH for not supporting his poor wife who definitely has a disorder (keep in mind that was diagnosed by Redditors). Yet nobody mentions mental illness in posts with lazy husbands.\n\n\nOr you get assumptions and hypothetical abuse scenarios. Once I saw a post here about a woman who cheated on her BF and moved in with her side piece in the middle of the night. Nothing in the post mentioned abuse. Comments had hordes of people fabricating scenarios where it was a poor meek abused woman who fled from her evil boyfriend despite no evidence. \n\nThis sub infantilises AH women because they can't fathom women who act like AHs of their own will.", "Agreed!\n\nTo the person above, who this reply was on: Sorry to say, but how do you know she has BPD based on these actions and/or is being abused? I totally agree that this girl probably has mental issues going on and probably needs therapy, but this is why there is such a huge stigma on BPD. Everytime someone acts batshit crazy, people are so quick to label it as BPD.\n\nFor the record, I have BPD myself and trust me, there are plenty of people with BPD who would NOT behave this way and would also find the actions of this girl deeply disturbing. The fact you have BPD doesn't automatically mean you are fit to diagnose people with the things you have.\n\nPeople really need to stop throwing BPD accusations around when someone is showing signs of being deeply unstable. Not all unstable people have BPD. Not all people with BPD are batshit crazy.\n\nSorry for my rant.", "Lol she\u2019s a teenager. \u201cThis is a prime example of failing to hold women accountable\u201d my god.
