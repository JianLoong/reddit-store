There's me 19f, my brother 18m and our younger sister 12f. My brother and I are the closest of the three of us. We were always friends as well as siblings and he has always been my ally. My sister is someone I have a complicated relationship with. As the baby of the family she was obviously a bit spoiled when she came along, especially when she was a surprise baby for our parents. But once she was a little older (4 or 5) and she had a lot of energy and was often very hyper, our parents forced me to take on a role as a caregiver of sorts. I was expected to help feed her and calm her down before bed. I was told I needed to walk her to school once she started. If I was going to see friends she was always forced along. The more time she was pushed on me, the more she wanted me and the more my parents made me include her. They never expected that from my brother. Even told us to our faces that of course sisters will be closer and will take care of little sisters. That it's not a brother's job.\n\nThey made everything surrounding my sister for me a chore. I was never hanging out with her because I wanted to, but because I had to take care of her. I had to keep her safe on the way to school. Had to make sure she ate (and this would be when our mom was home, btw). I had to take her along with me as if I was a single mom without childcare. So my feelings for my sister are complicated and the sad thing is she considers me her second mom as well as her sister. She used to call me mommy-sis and even as she grew older she would describe me as her sister-mom to people. I have found it hard to truly maintain a relationship with her because I always want space and time from her, to figure out my feelings, but know it would hurt her if I did take that time, because she is so used to me being around.\n\nWhat happened is my brother and I went on a weekend trip with some friends of ours. My parents found out and told me I should have taken my sister along and how awful it was that I was pulling away from my sister and spent far less time with her than I should be. They said they can clearly see I love my brother more and that's wrong. I snapped and told them they were sexist assholes for only expecting that kind of role from me and that if they want to blame anyone for the way things are with my sister and I, then they should blame themselves for forcing me to take care of her when I was just her sister, not her parent.

This isn't your sisters fault and it certainly isn't your fault. The blame for all of this can be laid firmly at the feet of your parents.

You were used as a sort of au pair while your brother did what he wanted to. It is NOT natural for a child with two parents to call her sister a 'mom' of any kind. \n\nYou said the right thing to them and I don't know where you go from here, but you can no longer be forced to care for your sister.

Instead of growing up as sisters you see her more of someone who is always invading your space and as someone who has taken away a lot of your childhood. Your relationship with your brother on the other hand is more rewarding as its what you wanted. As both of you are adults, you can decide how you want to live your life and tell your parents to sod off as your little sister is 12 and they can take care of her if they want to. You have every right to your life and its time you did things that you wanted as I am sure the 12 year old can fend for herself as she is no longer a baby.

Peaceful. I started building a shelter out there. Nobody screaming at me. Just birds and my deer. Left home just after my 17th birthday.\n\nWell, now she's 48 and I'm 55. She somehow still expects me to just provide whatever she wants, while she insults me. I moved clear across the damn country to get away from it. Cannot stand her. Super entitled, and a pill popper too. I have one glass of wine, the hills echo with accusations of alcoholism. She has her 4th car-totaling wreck while completely zoned on Ambien, *with her small daughter in the car*, they want me to move home and take care of the kid, and everyone else, and their damn dogs, and pay for everything. Including the groceries which I'm supposed to cook. And rent. RENT. Like I'm gonna pay 600 a week to be chef, chauffeur, maid, and IT  (nobody else knows how to do any damn thing, it's exhausting, I dont have all the answers either, I look that shit up; they suddenly go all helpless. Usually turns out that they stepped on the power cord).\n\nNope. \n\nOur parents finally died, thank fuck, once the estate clears, that's fucking it, I will never speak to my sister again. Will prob have her daughter on my doorstep in a few years. That's okay, got a room for her, and I know a metric fuckton of good lawyers. Sis will be paying me child support. Her poor kid, damn. I send that girl random stuff to be a bit of happy.\n\nLook what I've dealt with. I'm damn strong, it nearly broke me. I still have crying fits; why the fuck was I never loved? I tried, I tried SO HARD, why? *Why*?\n\nThere is no answer apart from, my parents were selfish assholes.\n\nBut I...I can be, and am, better.\n\nSave yourself some pain. Protect yourself. Don't end up like me, weeping for a life wasted on chasing love that does not and will not exist. Once you get out, block everyone but your sister; she will need your help - she has to make the jump herself, or you both will subside into old patterns with her as the child. Bad move. \n\nNever look back. Real family doesn't treat you like this. I have one now. Picked up a sister here, brother there, countless cousins, daughters, sons. They're amazing. Not related by blood. Genetics don't matter, love does. \n\nLove is what you and I don't have from our genetic line. Doesn't matter. Create your own family.\n\nI'll be your momma, if you want. However different we are,  I will love and cherish you. \n\nSend me a PM if you like. I can be just your Internet mom, or you can join the family. The youngest is 22. I'm the oldest. Only rule is to take care of each other. Including all. Got some trans kids, kids of different colors, kids of different religions. Questions are generally okay, gotta learn somehow, but be nice.\n\nNobody in my fam will get creepy. We don't roll that way. If I don't catch it, one of the aunts or uncles will. Never have had a problem. I would get my ass on a plane to forcefully explain why someone is being evicted from the fam. My people. OUR people. Everyone in the fam knows to gather round, defend, and protect. Some aren't good at it, maybe not now, maybe never. Doesn't matter. They have different strengths, they'll do what they can when they can. They already do. They are, to me...they are light, no matter how dark it gets. \n\nThey taught me love.", "They expect some weird stuff. Almost seems like they're using your sister to keep you in line.
