There's me 19f, my brother 18m and our younger sister 12f. My brother and I are the closest of the three of us. We were always friends as well as siblings and he has always been my ally. My sister is someone I have a complicated relationship with. As the baby of the family she was obviously a bit spoiled when she came along, especially when she was a surprise baby for our parents. But once she was a little older (4 or 5) and she had a lot of energy and was often very hyper, our parents forced me to take on a role as a caregiver of sorts. I was expected to help feed her and calm her down before bed. I was told I needed to walk her to school once she started. If I was going to see friends she was always forced along. The more time she was pushed on me, the more she wanted me and the more my parents made me include her. They never expected that from my brother. Even told us to our faces that of course sisters will be closer and will take care of little sisters. That it's not a brother's job.\n\nThey made everything surrounding my sister for me a chore. I was never hanging out with her because I wanted to, but because I had to take care of her. I had to keep her safe on the way to school. Had to make sure she ate (and this would be when our mom was home, btw). I had to take her along with me as if I was a single mom without childcare. So my feelings for my sister are complicated and the sad thing is she considers me her second mom as well as her sister. She used to call me mommy-sis and even as she grew older she would describe me as her sister-mom to people. I have found it hard to truly maintain a relationship with her because I always want space and time from her, to figure out my feelings, but know it would hurt her if I did take that time, because she is so used to me being around.\n\nWhat happened is my brother and I went on a weekend trip with some friends of ours. My parents found out and told me I should have taken my sister along and how awful it was that I was pulling away from my sister and spent far less time with her than I should be. They said they can clearly see I love my brother more and that's wrong. I snapped and told them they were sexist assholes for only expecting that kind of role from me and that if they want to blame anyone for the way things are with my sister and I, then they should blame themselves for forcing me to take care of her when I was just her sister, not her parent.

This isn't your sisters fault and it certainly isn't your fault. The blame for all of this can be laid firmly at the feet of your parents.

You were used as a sort of au pair while your brother did what he wanted to. It is NOT natural for a child with two parents to call her sister a 'mom' of any kind. \n\nYou said the right thing to them and I don't know where you go from here, but you can no longer be forced to care for your sister.

Instead of growing up as sisters you see her more of someone who is always invading your space and as someone who has taken away a lot of your childhood. Your relationship with your brother on the other hand is more rewarding as its what you wanted. As both of you are adults, you can decide how you want to live your life and tell your parents to sod off as your little sister is 12 and they can take care of her if they want to. You have every right to your life and its time you did things that you wanted as I am sure the 12 year old can fend for herself as she is no longer a baby.
