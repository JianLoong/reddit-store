{"id": 12099, "submission_id": "11p97k4", "title": "AITA for calling my parents sexist and telling them to blame themselves for the things they aren't happy about?", "selftext": "My parents have three kids together. There's me 19f, my brother 18m and our younger sister 12f. My brother and I are the closest of the three of us. We were always friends as well as siblings and he has always been my ally. My sister is someone I have a complicated relationship with. As the baby of the family she was obviously a bit spoiled when she came along, especially when she was a surprise baby for our parents. But once she was a little older (4 or 5) and she had a lot of energy and was often very hyper, our parents forced me to take on a role as a caregiver of sorts. I was expected to help feed her and calm her down before bed. I was told I needed to walk her to school once she started. If I was going to see friends she was always forced along. The more time she was pushed on me, the more she wanted me and the more my parents made me include her. They never expected that from my brother. Even told us to our faces that of course sisters will be closer and will take care of little sisters. That it's not a brother's job.\n\nThey made everything surrounding my sister for me a chore. I was never hanging out with her because I wanted to, but because I had to take care of her. I had to keep her safe on the way to school. Had to make sure she ate (and this would be when our mom was home, btw). I had to take her along with me as if I was a single mom without childcare. So my feelings for my sister are complicated and the sad thing is she considers me her second mom as well as her sister. She used to call me mommy-sis and even as she grew older she would describe me as her sister-mom to people. I have found it hard to truly maintain a relationship with her because I always want space and time from her, to figure out my feelings, but know it would hurt her if I did take that time, because she is so used to me being around.\n\nWhat happened is my brother and I went on a weekend trip with some friends of ours. My parents found out and told me I should have taken my sister along and how awful it was that I was pulling away from my sister and spent far less time with her than I should be. They said they can clearly see I love my brother more and that's wrong. I snapped and told them they were sexist assholes for only expecting that kind of role from me and that if they want to blame anyone for the way things are with my sister and I, then they should blame themselves for forcing me to take care of her when I was just her sister, not her parent. They told me I was not the only kid ever asked to care about young siblings and am the asshole for blaming them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678608954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p97k4/aita_for_calling_my_parents_sexist_and_telling/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents abused you, BTW. It's not your sister's fault, but I guess those are the consequences.", "NTA. They made you her parent, and didn't extend the chore to your brother. I can't believe they made you take your 7 years-younger sister with you all the time, and even though you're now an adult they are still at it.", "NTA your parents were forcing you into the parent position when they couldn't be bothered. You were just a child yourself. There's major differences between babysitting your sister and actively being forced into an adult role. That's unhealthy and not right on your parents part. This gives me the impression she was an accident and so were passing her off which is god awful for your sister too wtf...", "NTA.  They failed to do THEIR responsibilities and projected them on you.  I would consider low to no contact with them.  You are not your sister's keeper and never should have been.", "NTA\n\nThey screwed her and probably you up, and were too lazy to raise her.", "NTA. They put to much on you and parentified you. Kids need time with kids their own age. They should have respected that then and now.", "NTA. Your parents have really failed at basic parenting. They pretty much forced you to take an adult\u2019s role when you were just a child, and denied your sister having a normal sibling relationship with you. Also, did she even have a chance to make friends and be with children of her own age?", "NTA what your parents did was parentification which is a type of abuse. It seems like your sister just wants a regular sibling relationship but realized early on it wasn't one. It might be time to pull away from your parents if you can.", "NTA. This isn't your sisters fault and it certainly isn't your fault. The blame for all of this can be laid firmly at the feet of your parents. You were entirely correct in your last paragraph except for one thing, you are not the AH for blaming them. They need to step up and become parents.", "NTA.", "NTA. You were a ready made nanny. Parents do ask older siblings to watch out for younger, it\u2019s always been that way, and yes, historically it was more girls than boys because they helped on the farm or around the yard/house. But. Your parents sound lazy and just gave you the responsibility of raising your sister taking away your own childhood. I hope you can get over feelings of resentment towards her, it was your folks who were in the wrong.\n\nThey are upset because now they have to take on the responsibility for her.", "nta\n\nthey broughtg her into the world, she is their job, not yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nother parents pushing their duties onto children does not make your parents doing the same any less incompetent or less irresponsible.", "NTA. You are right, they treated you differently because you are a girl and that has had an effect on your life that your brother doesn't have to worry about.\n\nYou had to do a lot of work with your sister, and give you lot of your time, when actually your parents were capable of doing that themselves. You were used as a sort of au pair while your brother did what he wanted to. It is NOT natural for a child with two parents to call her sister a 'mom' of any kind. \n\nYou said the right thing to them and I don't know where you go from here, but you can no longer be forced to care for your sister. You need to start living your own life. I don't know what your plans for the future are, but if you can get out, do it.", "NTA. Your parents dumped their responsibilities onto you. Not only is that a really rubbish thing for your parents to do, but they also added some casual sexism into the mix too by never expecting your brother to help with the youngest.\n\nParentification is a word that is sometimes overused on reddit, but it's completely accurate in this case. \n\nI don't understand how they can watch your little sister call you \"mommy sis\" and not realise how badly they are failing the both of you.\n\nI hope you have the ability to distance yourself from your parents (move out etc.) As I truly do not see them ever realising how negatively their actions have impacted you, without you taking significant steps. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYour brother should be as much as responsible for your sister as you are. Your parents need to learn that they can't make a sibling bond.", "NTA They didn't want to parent your sister at all and because they were sexist, they forced that role on you. Awful behaviour. I'm sorry for you and your sister and I hope in the future you can mend your relationship as none of you are at fault here. \n\nYou should move out and hang out with your siblings as you want to when you want to.", "If your description is accurate, definitely NTA. \n\nThey say you\u2019re not the only kid ever asked to care for younger siblings- has your brother *ever* taken care of your sister? \n\nThe way they guilt you with their \u201cwell, you clearly don\u2019t love your sister as much as your brother\u201d along with the fact that she calls you mom-sis is really disturbing.\n\nWhat does your brother say to all this? \n\nAnyway, the word here is parentification. It\u2019s normal for siblings to look after each other a bit, but when it\u2019s this excessive and this sexist and your parents stoop to manipulating you with guilt trips to keep offloading your sister\u2019s care onto you, it\u2019s just plain wrong.", "There's a difference between care *about* and care *for*. You were forced to care *for* your sister, get her to school, make sure she ate, take her with you when you just wanted to be with your friends. NTA, and what you told them is the truth. They were wrong to make you do that. Not stopping your sister from calling you a variation of  *mom* was an especially AH move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No one should be forced to do this and while helping out at home is fine, being a full time carer without any space is not right. Your parents have been pretty miserable parents and they should have thought about that before they got funny in between the sheets 12 years ago. They somehow wanted their lives and with you and your brother grown up, decided to just dump her on you resulting in your resentment towards her, which is unfair on you both. Instead of growing up as sisters you see her more of someone who is always invading your space and as someone who has taken away a lot of your childhood. Your relationship with your brother on the other hand is more rewarding as its what you wanted. As both of you are adults, you can decide how you want to live your life and tell your parents to sod off as your little sister is 12 and they can take care of her if they want to. You have every right to your life and its time you did things that you wanted as I am sure the 12 year old can fend for herself as she is no longer a baby. Enjoy your life and move out if you can to allow for more space and to enjoy life before you get older and miss out on a lot of fun you can have in your young adult life. Wish you well.", "NTA, your parents are trying to absolve themselves of some responsibility for your sister. Yes you're her big sister and should look out for her but you still deserve your own life and interests that don't involve her. What will happen if you and your bother go off to college, or when you get a full-time job?", "NTA - your parents are fully to blame for how your feel about your sister. Instead of you seeing her as a future friend when she gets older, she was made a burden to you. An expectation you had to meet. Like who wants that? No adult would like that so why are you, a teenager, expected to have that and love it. \nYour parents are daft. But I\u2019m guessing by their behaviour they will not be emotionally mature enough to evaluate their actions and thus the consequences they have created.", "NTA but keep in mind the sister is innocent in all this. Don't throw your anger on her or be rude on her for what your parents are doing.", "NTA\n\nIf you sister calls you sister mom dose that mean she calls your mom Grandma?", "NTA\n\nStand your ground. Don\u2019t cave ever when they give you that BS answer. Stand in your truth. YOU ARE RIGHT!\n\nWhat you told your parents is THE truth. \n\nAlso, space will help your relationship with your sister in the long run. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. You need the space to miss your sister and change the dynamic of the relationship.\n\nMaybe try explaining to your sister why you need some space? Or make a weekly or every other week, sister date to make up for having to spend less time with her on the regular. Make mom and dad parent and spend time with their child.

That's how they see it.", "That's like the understatement of the year to me. NTA.", "Beer gophers", "I 100% know it's not. But I also can't force the feelings to change. Maybe in the future it will be easier but as of right now the difficulty in the relationship is a consequence of years of being forced to act as a parent to her.", "It was so annoying and they then can't understand why I might be closer to my brother. I was never forced to spend that kind of time with him and we could build our relationship as it worked for us. Not by force.", "She did but mostly it was her tagging along with me or me having to take her to see her friends. So I was still very much involved, I guess.", "I already moved out, so has my brother.", "He never had to take care of her. It was always me.

I was told he would take me with him on dates! But he did that because he wanted to. I certainly wasn't tagging along at age 12 with the next oldest when he was 18. I have often \"joked\" that I didn't have siblings, I had 4 extra sets of parents (the oldest 3 were all married before I turned 10, the last when I was in HS). But they definitely didn't raise me, my mom and dad did, because they weren't assholes! I'm sorry your parents saw things differently.", "Yes, and that is understandable. Anyway, your sister is 7 years younger than you, so it's natural that you don't want her with you when you go out with your brother. 7 years might not be much when you are both in your 60's but it's a lot when you are a teenager.", "I might be the AH here, but you should be having a conversation with your brother, too. He got off very lightly, didn't he? He gets to go away for weekends without any interference. \n\nHe should be recognising what his privilege in being a boy has done to you and supporting you in front of your parents. He's old enough now to see how the land lies.", "OMG your parents are unbearable. It's not their business how you spend your own time.", "Has he said any of this to your parents?", "Oh wow, then your parents definitely need to reconsider what they expect you to do.", "They do.", "He does support me. He was always there when I needed someone to talk to and agreed it was unfair.", "He needs to do that in front of your parents now, he's old enough. It's OK saying 'there, there' in private and letting everything carry on as usual. But that doesn't help you. He's in a position now to help turn this around for you. If he's Golden Boy, let him say to his parents that they're wrong, have treated you appallingly and he won't stand for it anymore. I know you love him but he needs to do this."]}
