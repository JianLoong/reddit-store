Which was actually an inside joke between the 3 of us lol\nI also want to say again that I had met him several times, we were not strangers. I\u2019m quite shy and wouldn\u2019t say anything like that to someone I didn\u2019t know.

Simple.", "NTA Well he was rude to you and I get that 1000%, someone said that to me they\\`d be straight out of any plans I had ever. Secondly your wedding, your choices. She doesn\\`t get a say. Honestly rescind the invite to this person of dubious quality", "I'm so confused. I know what a Maid/Matron of Honour (MOH) is. What's an MOA? I assume something similar?\n\nAssuming that it is . . . **ESH.**\n\nYou absolutely are not obligated to make her one of your wedding attendants. Yes, these things are often reciprocal, but there is no rule of etiquette that states that it has to be. She is an AH for making any such demand.\n\nThat said, you're an AH for not inviting her husband. A husband is not a +1. You either invite married couples in their entirety, as a couple, or you don't invite them. That's the social obligation and rule of etiquette in these matters. Ask Emily Post, Ann Landers, or any other such expert. \n\nAnd just to be clear: you have every right not to like her husband. He was exceptionally and shockingly rude to you. On the other hand, it seems to me that you were rather disgustingly rude to him as well, and at his own wedding. It doesn't matter if you framed it as a \"joke\" . . . you walked up to this man who barely knew you and \"\\[gave him\\] the typical 'don't hurt my friend or else' \\[speech\\]\" about HIS new bride, a woman who you fully admit at that point you were only tangentially friends with anymore, but who was the love of his life?! Do you have any idea how deeply inappropriate and unbearably rude it was to give him ANY kind of a \"warning\", no matter whether you delivered it in a lighthearted, joking tone or not? Frankly, I have to wonder if he was rude to you because he was appalled at your audacity.  That whole interaction was not at all one-sided. \n\nNonetheless, however you and he may feel about each other, and even if this WERE entirely about him, your choice was to invite them as a couple with the understanding that he would likely decline anyway based on your mutual dislike . . . or to not invite them at all. You don't invite half of a married couple to your wedding. It's tacky AF. \n\nESH, and it's probably best that you just let this friendship go.", ">Mary was elsewhere so I went up to Will to give the typical \u201cdon\u2019t hurt my friend or else..\u201d jokingly. He got offended.\n\nWhat do you mean hurt her?  Imply at his own wedding that he might cheat on her?  Can you explain the funny part of that joke?  I struggle to see it.  I only see that you very seriously insulted the groom and your friend's marriage at their own wedding.  Bravo. I think he went overboard with his reaction, but I'd be pretty damn offended too.\n\nThen, you double down on it by only inviting Mary and not her husband.  I'll assume you're aware that's highly insulting and the kind of invitation nobody would accept.  Yet she did somehow.\n\nI'd say that if you wanted to make things right, you'd apologize, take responsibility for the whole thing, and send Will an invitation.
