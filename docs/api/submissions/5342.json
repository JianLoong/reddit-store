I typically head to my parents' place from my campus apartment around a week after finals end, but made the decision to head back early this year thanks to predicted inclement weather during the time I usually make the drive, and multiple instances of the heat going out in my building. I had already completed my in-person exams at that point and all I had left to do was finish up an essay that could be remotely submitted.\n\nMy parents' house is kind of in a state of chaos right now. My sister and my nieces are staying with them for the time being and while I love seeing them and thought I could handle it, a house full of people isn't really essay writing friendly for someone with ADHD. After asking a few local family and friends if they had a place for me to hang out for the next few days and finish up, I ended up at my brother-in-law's sister's house. (A little confusing, I know.) I had met her (Dee, 30f) on multiple occasions, and had hung out with her husband (Sam, 29m) and my BIL fairly often over the summer. They had a guest room for me to sleep in and Sam has a pretty kick-ass home office / library sort of thing he said would be perfect for me to write in. \n\nI arrived on December 7th, and my essay was due on the 9th. From the time I got there, Dee seemed a little put off about the whole thing - something I found odd - but I just focused on my work. Sam and I had a few drinks that night and hung out in his study until Dee came in and basically demanded he come to bed. I ended up finishing and submitting my essay the next day around 6pm, but Sam requested I stay longer as Dee was going on a girls trip for the weekend. I agreed.\n\nI had a really great weekend. Sam and I had been close for a while, like I said, but I hadn't ever gotten to hang out with him alone. We had a routine of smoking a little, then going to his room to put on a movie that we would inevitably end up ignoring in favor of talking about anything and everything. He and I have a lot in common so it was one of those situations where we'd get lost in conversation and then suddenly it's 3am at which point I would typically head to the guest room.\n\nOn Saturday night, we did the same thing, but we both must've dozed off at some point. I woke up to Dee basically yanking me out of bed, telling me I had 'overstayed my welcome' and that she had expected me to be gone by the time she got back from her trip. I essentially got kicked out, and later got a text from my sister asking me why Dee was blowing up my BIL's phone and that I had embarrassed her in front of her in-laws. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I mentioned this above, but I\u2019m 24.

Nobody in this situation seems to be able to communicate properly. \n\nYou got caught in the crossfires of their inability to communicate but if you got a vibe and it was clearly about your relationship with Sam, you could have talked to Dee or read the room. \n\nHonestly it's a bit shitty all around for everyone.", "\u201cI woke up to Dee basically yanking me out of bed\u201d. I think you mean, \u201cyanking me out of *her* bed\u201d, y\u2019know, the one with her husband currently in it? \n\nYTA, and honestly Dee handled you waaaaay nicer than I would have\u2026\n\nBtw how did you already establish a \u201croutine\u201d of smoking with her husband and staying in their bed when you\u2019d only been there for like 3 days? Weren\u2019t you \u201cfocused\u201d on your essay?", "Why would you \u201cgo to his room\u201d to watch a movie? You said the house was nice\u2026 they don\u2019t have a living room and couch?", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m a dude and I\u2019m best friends with my brother in law, my sister and he live at my grandparent\u2019s house and as such the gaming consoles are in the bedroom. My sister would be weirded out if we were both asleep in there, she might even tell me to avoid letting that happen in the future.\n\nBut if OP didn\u2019t fuck Sam, then I think OPs okay. Wife is also justified in being pissed, but nobody did anything wrong except maybe Sam. Who should\u2019ve known how his wife would react.", "NTA.  This is a conflict between Sam and Dee.  Sam invited you into his bedroom.  Dee disagreed, but she took it out on you not Sam.  They have a communication problem, and a boundary problem too since they involved your sister.", "Whoah... I was all ready to put N T A here until I saw the other comments and re-read to realize you were sleeping in his bed with him?!?  YTA... but I'm not even sure if AH is the right word here.  Clearly Dee and Sam have issues, but nah dude don't sleep in a married persons bed without clear communication about what the situation is.", "She found you in bed with him. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve also destroyed his marriage.\n\nGreat job. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - \u201cwatching a movie\u201d in bed with the woman\u2019s husband is overstaying your welcome alright. Good grief, you can\u2019t possibly be this clueless.", "YTA and Sam too.  The master bedroom is never an appropriate place to entertain anyone.  Ever.  You really don\u2019t understand why someone would be pissed off to find you sleeping in her fucking bed with her husband.", "YTA\n\nI think this is the reason I avoid socially awkward situations in general. Seriously though, you say from the start she was \u201cput off\u201d by you being there. So you had to of known she wasn\u2019t comfortable with you crashing at their place, and to be clear it is THEIR place, not just your friends. The fact you didn\u2019t just introduce him as a friend and went through family relations makes it feel like more of an acquaintance. \n\nEither way she obviously made it clear you were not welcomed to stay longer, sure he may have said that, but the socially correct thing to do would have been to say you couldn\u2019t stay but would love to hangout later. \n\nNgl though if I walked in on my husband high/drunk with another man in my bed that I didn\u2019t want staying in the first place I would have also immediately booted you out and called whatever family members got you in the door in the first place. Sure they need to communicate better, but you gotta pick up on social cues.", "ESH. And by everyone I mean you and the husband. Life tip: learn to read the room. You were invited for a couple of days to work on your essay. You end up in the master bedroom after a couple of days smoking/ staying up all night and enabling the husbands obviously immature behavior. This couple has other issues going on. Your presence wasn\u2019t helping.", "She literally found you in bed together lol yta", "I\u2019m going to say NAH on this one. It sounds like you and Sam had some platonic bonding, but at the same time, if I came home and found my partner sleeping next to my house guest, in my bed!, while I was out of town, I think I would have asked the guest to leave too. It\u2019s not your fault, but hanging out in their bed watching movies just feels a bit off. It\u2019s really on him for crossing a boundary with his wife, but I am surprised you are surprised about her reaction. \n\nYou also called it \u201cSam\u2019s room\u201d not THEIR bedroom. It\u2019s hers too. And you just kind of made yourself at home in her spot on the bed. You couldn\u2019t watch movies in the living area? Is there some info missing here? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything inappropriate, but I don\u2019t think her reaction is out of proportion either.", "YTA. \nSam is a cad. Let\u2019s get that out of the way first and foremost. He should not have been inviting you into his room to watch movies. Honestly it comes off like he was testing the waters to see if you were into him and how far he could take it. \n\nBut also, you are old enough to know that that is wholly inappropriate behavior. You should not be getting blitzed and then getting into a married man\u2019s bed. Period. Do they not have a living room TV? \n\nI can\u2019t fault Dee here honestly, because if I came home and found my husband asleep in bed with another person, I\u2019d be throwing them *both* out.", "YTA Stay out of a married man's bed.", "NTA if OP was a girl and his friend was the wife it wouldn\u2019t be seen as a problem. Two ppl hanging out in the master bedroom is not a crime. But if your friend knew his wife was uncomfortable then he should\u2019ve communicated better", "How is everyone missing that OP is male. If I came home to find my husband asleep in bed with his new guy friend after hanging out smoking and shooting the shit.. I would be annoyed you\u2019re in my bed but that\u2019s about it and I wouldn\u2019t make it obvious nvm yank you out of bed. NTA.", "Babe, you know this is dangerous territory. You don\u2019t stay at someone\u2019s house over the weekend while their wife is out of town. Period. While you and Sam have some things in common and can casually hang out, he\u2019s married. Don\u2019t be that girl. YTA.", "I go with NTA. But I also think there is more to the story here.  Maybe he has cheated on his wife with a man.", "INFO: how did Dee discover yall when waking yall up? Were you both under the covers on the pillows? Was it a situation where yall were watching a movie and yall fell asleep above the covers facing the TV?", "NTA - It sounds like Sam didnt communicate you would be staying the weekend while Dee was on her girls trip, and didnt expect you to be at their home, let alone in her bed right when she got home from travelling. I can understand her frustrations, but shes taking it out on the wrong person and you got caught in the middle of it.", "NTA. Were you supposed to sit on the floor or something to watch a movie? Because it sounds like you guys were just using it as a place to sit while watching a movie. It\u2019s not cheating to be sitting on a bed together watching a movie. You accidentally fell asleep because it was late. Yeah it probably looked bad, but Sam can explain that nothing happened and if Dee chooses to believe it or not is up to her.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault Dee and Sam don\u2019t communicate properly.", "I think everyone is missing that he said 24M not F. Feels like op is oblivious that Sam is bi.\n\nETA: Nta", "YTA do you not realize how inappropriate you BOTH were? My bf would have gotten crap thrown at him if I walked into MY BEDROOM to see him an a friend passed out on MY BED. She has every right to be raging. You slept in her bed and flirted with her husband. You couldn't sound more in love with him if you tried", "NAH. You were invited to stay and didn't do anything wrong, although maybe you didn't quite read the room as far as Dee was concerned.\n\nIt probably did look a little weird though for her to walk into her bedroom and find you and her husband asleep together.\n\nEdit: I'm changing my judgement from N T A because after I thought about it that judgement implies that Dee did something wrong; which she didn't. Although I don't think you really did anything wrong as an invited guest, her reaction to coming home and finding you in her bed with her husband wasn't wrong, either.", "NTA. \n\nHow could other comments be saying you broke up a marriage? I get the visual that she must\u2019ve had but come on. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it was probably cool that you had a friend to hang out with. \n\nI feel like the communication between them is absolutely the problem. Dee should not have agreed to have you there if there was some underlying issue she had with her husband or she was worried about you overstaying.", "Y\u2019ALL - OP is a MALE. The amount of comments confused about this is staggering. I am torn on this one. As I read it, one does get the impression that someone is feeling something more than just friendship here, but I can\u2019t assume that. If it\u2019s truly platonic, Dee should have a conversation with her husband to set boundaries and share feelings vs. being rude to an invited guest. The husband extended the invite and seemed to be okay with hanging out in bed so, while this may be odd to some, to each their own. I\u2019m going to call NTA, but some more situational awareness in the future would be sensible to respect Dee\u2019s feelings.", "NTA. It seems like Dee\u2019s got some insecurities", "OP - where do the \u201cin-laws\u201d come in? She told your sister you had embarrassed her in front of her in laws? We\u2019re they in the bedroom too when she woke you two up? Was she also waking up the ice a the same time? So many missing details here.", "Edit: I'm changing mine to NTA based on OPs comment below. Sam and Dee have some communication issues. \n\nYou got there on the 7th, which means the night Dee told you to leave was the 10th. So the 8th, 9th, and 10th you stayed in Dee and Sam's bed till 3 am. From what you've written it looks like she hadn't left on her trip yet when she kicked you out. You said she was acting weird the whole time you were there? My guess is she didn't want you staying there in the first place, and either your BIL or Sam talked her into it. \n\nYou're TA cause even if you and Sam didn't do anything inappropriate (and yes I do realize you're male), staying in their room till 3 am is *insanely* rude. What did Dee do during this time, just wait for you to be done so she could go to bed? I'd be pissed at you by the 3rd night too. Not to mention that's weird AF to begin with. \n\nSam and Dee are also TA cause Sam should be more considerate of his life partner, and Dee should have expressed her frustration to Sam and gotten him to kick you out the day you said you'd leave. I'm assuming either she didn't or Sam refused to. Either way, they have communication issues.", "NTA. Dee clearly has some issues but I don't see what you have done wrong to warrant her attitude.\n\nAlso many posters seem to have overlooked the fact you are a guy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mmm ok.", "Geez, Oprah told me years ago that it takes six weeks to establish a habit. OP really made quick work of establishing his routine. Why can\u2019t I make myself exercise every day? What\u2019s his secret?!", "I agree with the second part, but you'd be surprised how inaccurate your first statement is. Almost everyone in my friend circle cuddle together / smoke / watch movies. But we are also the spiritual / connected /hippy /whatever you want to call it type of people. I'm not saying this was at all the case for OP and sam, just pointing out a lot of people can and do, do these things platonically.", "OP is a guy\n\nStill weird they\u2019re hanging out in the couple\u2019s bed though", "It's a 19yo relative by marriage. If Sam is considering this a prospect he's far more fucked inn the head than simple infidelity; it's pseudo-incest and arguably grooming, given OP surely knew Sam while OP was still a minor.\n\nA 19yo kid in my family would, well... still be considered a kid in a lot of ways. I'm truly baffled that so many people, See included, assumed something salacious and sexually untowards.", "Nope they shouldn't.  Just tailoring my comment to this specific situation.", "Absolutely, The husband is wrong. I was alluding to something isn\u2019t being disclosed", "So if I found my husband in bed with a woman I should just assume nothing happened because I trust him? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a spouse has been duped into trusting their cheating SO. Not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening or that harmless mistakes can\u2019t happen, but sometimes you do have to look at facts as well.", "\"lets head up the bedroom and smoke\" and then wife finds them passed out in bed together? I'm a guy, I have plenty of friends. I've never shared a bed with any of them. Especially when there's a whole house for us to hang out in.", "Okay, yeah, then I did read that right. By saying she expected you would be gone by the time she got back, she meant that, when she left, she thought you would be gone when she got back, but was suprised you were still there (and in her bed!)\n\nId say NTA. You were invited, but the two of them seemed to disagree and put you in the middle of it. Sam and Dee are the ones who need to work this out.", "Personally, no.\n\nThese are two (seemingly) straight men. One is just above legal, the other is married. OP stated they had been friends beforehand, and they wanted to bond a bit.\n\nI have fallen asleep in the same bed as my friends before, Ive even fallen asleep in the same bed as my married girl friend, and we're both bi. Her husband knew there wasnt anything going on and didnt care.\n\nDee is, of course, entitled to her boundaries. She is entitled to be upset, and she is not in the wrong for being upset.\n\nBut please, lets not try to make *everything* about sex, or cheating. The way the post is written almost feels like OP idolizes the husband, the way a younger sibling idolizes an older. Not romantic.", "I\u2019m so glad you said this. I didn\u2019t realize it because I thought it said 24f before he changed it to say the full gender.\n\nIt is really strange. I totally agree.", "So what? Doesn\u2019t mean no sex occurred.", "Politely clarifying that I\u2019m 24, and Sam and I aren\u2019t related. My sister is married to Dee\u2019s brother. I agree that 19 definitely feels like a kid in a lot of ways, though.", "Dee might just be upset that she\u2019s come home from a trip to not only still have a houseguest, but to also have said houseguest in her room where it reeks of weed. \n\nYou guys could\u2019ve smoked in another area of the house that was not in their personal bedroom.", "Could be...", "You know your husband, not me.", "It was updated, but the post I was responding to referred to OP as \u201cher\u201d. \n\nIt is definitely a possibility that they banged."]}
