I\u2019ve grown up with the belief that the entire purpose of a holiday is spending it with the ones you love - so why would you celebrate it when someone has to miss out?\n\nFor years, my in laws used the excuse that they did it on that day to accommodate his grandparents. I could understand this to an extent, and I even attended a few times without my husband to be cordial (they are very nice people, but we have absolutely nothing in common). My husband and I have one kid (11) who would join me. \n\nUnfortunately, the grandparents are no longer around this year to celebrate. My MIL asked if I would be joining them for thanksgiving this year and I, gently, tried to ask that we do it on Sunday instead, so that EVERYONE in the family could attend. She laughed and said no, probably not. I didn\u2019t push any further because this is not the first time I\u2019ve made this request and been brushed off. \n\nMy family is having ours on Saturday just so my husband can attend. I feel like the asshole because my son is missing out on time with that side of the family, but I also don\u2019t want him thinking it\u2019s ok to leave family out of big holiday events. There\u2019s nothing stopping them from doing it Sunday other than \u201cwe don\u2019t want to\u201d - so am I the asshole for skipping it on principle?\n\nEditing to add some info - he makes triple time on thanksgiving. There have been some years where he picked up a shift for that reason. I certainly did not fault his family for not accommodating that. However, when a shift you normally work (in this case Thursday) falls on a holiday, you can\u2019t schedule off unless there some serious extenuating circumstances. The schedule changes every 6 months, so this is how people are able to work a holiday one year and have the opportunity to be off the next if they choose. His family seems more irritated about it this year when it was not his choice to work. They HAVE moved a holiday once to accommodate my sister in law, so that does make my husband feel bad. \n\nThere is no family traveling here. All of these people live within a mile of each other. Everyone is off for the entire weekend (they all work normal 9-5 type jobs). Their only reason for not changing it is because they don\u2019t want to. And that\u2019s valid, they don\u2019t have to - I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO MOVE THE HOLIDAY TO ACCOMMODATE US! I\u2019m simply asking if I\u2019m the asshole for not attending based on that choice.

Everyone who will be at the Thursday Thanksgiving dinner could go any day the entire WEEKEND? But they can't change the date? Hogwash.\n\nMy husband and I are retired, and we've told our daughter that for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, whatever other family get-together is planned, we are the ones who are more than willing and able to make dinner here or go there on any day that works best for them. They're the ones who have children -- we don't. They're the ones who work -- we don't. If it's easier for them to come here, great! I'll cook. If they have hockey/dance/judo/yoga/work and it's easier for them to not travel, great! We'll go there and fit into their schedule. \n\nI can't imagine planning a get-together \"for family\" and not including my son or daughter!", "Our parents generation are big on doing things on the actual day of regardless who shows.  Both my parents and in laws are all like this.  We\u2019ve been able to move it to the weekend before or after in past but they always make comments.  It\u2019s probably nothing against you and your husband, they\u2019re just set in their ways.  Enjoy your time with your family and hopefully if his family really wants you guys there or maybe even when grandparents pass, they\u2019ll come around to changing the date.  We\u2019re I. big trouble as today is my MILs bday and we celebrated last weekend but she\u2019s angry that we\u2019re not all doing thanksgiving with her today.  We can\u2019t win either way.", "NTA, in my family we basically do a poll and whatever date the majority can come is the date we choose, it doesn\u2019t have to be on the exact day, life isn\u2019t like that. You can ask each year but they can say no and have said no. It\u2019s up to you if you want to go without your husband, it\u2019s pretty crappy though that your family tries to accommodate him and his own family won\u2019t even try.", "NAH. It's a completely reasonable request and not attending without your husband is also reasonable.\n\nOn their side, some people consider holiday dates (like Thanksgiving) sacrosanct, and the idea of moving it is unthinkable. It's one of the reasons why Christmas and Thanksgiving have never been made Monday holidays.", "NTA. At all. Why can\u2019t he get at least some thanksgivings off?", "NAH. Thanksgiving is on Thursday. Not Saturday or Sunday. The rhythm of the holiday season is built that way: most stores are closed or have extremely limited hours on Thursday, the only tv is football, and the thanksgiving food, napkins, etc, are all gone from the groceries by Wednesday night (one of the things I've noticed about groceries here is the way they switch over seasonal items to the next holiday before the current holiday is even here yet). By Saturday, everyone will have moved on to Christmas shopping, tree lighting ceremonies and so on. People may have other engagements. If you can't attend or your husband can't attend because of work, that's fine, but other people shouldn't have to sit and twiddle their thumbs alone in a depressing, quiet house on Thursday because your husband is working. If his family want to have Thanksgiving on Thursday, I think that is fine. \n\nThat doesn't mean you and your husband and child have to miss Thanksgiving together.  If you want a Thanksgiving feast that your husband can attend, why don't you host one on Saturday? It can be your \"thing.\" Lots of families have two Thanksgiving dinners, hosted by two family members, to account for this sort of thing. My own family, for years, has had a 'regular' Thanksgiving on Thursday at grandma's, and a gluten-free, cat-welcoming one elsewhere on Friday. My SIL can only eat a few things at the Thursday dinner because she has celiac disease, and then she hosts the Friday dinner and my kid can't attend because he's allergic to her cats.\n\nI'm also confused why he has to work on EVERY Thanksgiving. Don't the holiday rota switch off who has to be working so that each person can be off for holidays at least SOME years? Also, he chose to work in a field that tends to work on holidays, I don't understand why everyone else in his entire family has to stare at the walls on holidays because of his choice.", "NTA\nAs a nurse I completely understand where you are coming from.  We can\u2019t choose what holidays we work and family needs to understand that.  Otherwise they are just self centered iMO", "NTA.\n\nThis reminds me of my favorite thanksgiving tradition in my family. My parents were divorced and my dad gave my mom Thanksgiving yearly and did ours Friday. Because everyone was still off school/work, we could invite extended family who would be elsewhere Thanksgiving day *and* us kids got to invite a friend each to come celebrate with us. Regular thanksgiving was forgettable. Thanksgiving Friday at dads? The best! \n\nHis family is missing out on the fun alternate thanksgiving because they believe it wouldn't be the same any other day.", "NTA. Two of my adult sons are working today (Thanksgiving Day) so guess what? We're celebrating on Saturday when everyone has the day off. See how easy that is?", "With the additional info NTA.", "NTA. I feel bad for your husband that his own parents think celebrating on a particular day is more important than having him there.\n\nMy MIL used to be like that. If she didn't get to celebrate your birthday on the actual day, then it doesn't count (so sorry everyone, you've never actually had a birthday that counts!). And holidays were the same, they HAD to be on the particular day. And then hubs decided we should go away for Christmas one year as a little mini vacation, and now Christmas is celebrated a week early. She's still sour about it, but she understands that it's that or nothing.\n\nWe always try to schedule to have the max amount of people attending, but there's also a limit to that. Thanksgiving (Canadian) this year dinner wasn't until 8pm to accommodate everyone. We're not postponing dinner that late for Christmas, but will make sure there's food left over for the late comers. It's about finding a balance.", " Our daughter, her husband and our grandaughter drove up to join us (7hr drive) for thanksgiving and will stay a few days. Our Grandson and our grandaughter's boyfriend can't join us on Thanksgiving so obviously we are waiting till Saturday to have our Thanksgiving dinner with everyone. How obvious is that? The two missing kids will be flying up to join us. We're having flank steak +.", "Going anywhere on thanksgiving (or any day) is not mandatory", "NTA.  We had my husband's thanksgiving two week ago so his dad could be with his wife and her family out of state on the holiday.  We are all with my family but not having the official dinner till Friday night because cousins are coming and they see their inlaws on Thanksgiving Day, and my sister is a nurse and picked up today's shift. We are just hanging out together all weekend and are having \"Thanksgiving\" on the day that worked best.  Do your own thing and don't go if your husband can't go, they seem to be so set in their traditions they forget the people.  And if they are upset tell them you would love to come hang out sometime soon, you will check husband's schedule!", "My in laws have never accommodated us ever-not at any point during the year. So they stopped getting holidays with us. My son is growing up realizing how little they actually try to be in his life and I won\u2019t push him to have a relationship with people who don\u2019t care enough to even try to be present or accommodate our schedules when we have always gone out of our way for them.", "NTA. And please thank your husband for working the holiday. People need medical care 24/7, and I\u2019m sure everyone who is under his care today is lucky to have him there working. I\u2019m sorry his parents don\u2019t appreciate the important and noble work he does.", "NTA\n\nIf they are too stuck in sticking with their tradition, then they need to understand that it might mean your section of the family does not attend. Given that they accomdated your SIL in the past, it is very likely that she is the favorite. While they may care about your husband, they do not care enough.\n\nMy MIL tried to do something similar about Christmas Day- always demanding we be there at 6AM and pitched a giant hissy fit if we left before noon. Gave zero fucks that we still had FIL's side, and my side to accommodate, with 10 to 50 miles of travel. We just stopped leaving the house on December 25th.  \n\nIf your husband continues to work on a holiday, just make it something special for you and your son. Make a lunch or dinner that you both really enjoy that isn't typical holiday food, create some new traditions of your own like seeing a movie or playing board or video games together or whatever else you can do to create some nice memories together. I would bet money that in the future, your son will appreciate and cherish it.", "My whole adult life I\u2019ve worked in fields that required me to work on holidays. That includes almost 30 years in emergency medicine. This year my schedule rotates and I\u2019m working Thanksgiving and Christmas. My Mom has always just asked me what day works to celebrate. You are NTA for requesting to celebrate on a different day.", "NTA, and I'm glad you got to grow up with a family that actually puts family first and it sounds like they have taken your husband under their wings.  \nMy parents divorced when I was little, holidays always rotated between.  \nWith my mums side, the holiday meal/activities happened when all could make it. On my dads side, it was on the date in question, hard stop. Leftovers the next day...if I was lucky.", "NTA\n\nCelebrate with your family and husband. If your child's grandparents feel they are missing out that's on them.", "NTA, and I\u2019m glad you are sticking up for your husband. I work a lot of holidays too and for years was reminded that I \u201cpicked the job that meant I might miss out\u201d\n\nCouldn\u2019t argue with that. But it still hurt. Until the multiple hears in a row Christmas was planned around my sister. One of those years I was left totally alone except the random strangers in my building who invited me over. It hurts. And I low key hate Christmas now.", "Your husband chooses to work, which is fine. However, expecting everyone else to not celebrate at the time of their choosing in order for him to be included is, at best, out of touch. Why should anyone accommodate for him when he chooses to not make accommodations for them?\n\nYou can skip whatever you want, but YTA for putting this on them when it really sounds like the onus is on your husband.", "NTA.  Your own family comes first.", "NTA My family moved Christmas dinner often enough because they needed a date that would work for the adults. In high school and college I worked a job where I really had to work on Christmas and Thanksgiving. I could attend the dinners if they were a little earlier in the day, but my parents and I couldn't convince people to move it even an hour earlier. Then I'd get comments about how I never made it to holidays. Your family has the right idea. Picking the day that everyone can make it makes sense. The only reason it wouldn't would be if the other days proposed didn't work for other people which isn't the case here. Have a wonderful day with your family this weekend!", "My dad was a policeman - I remember one year we had Thanksgiving dinner at midnight, because that's when he got home. \n\nThis year we were supposed to go to Mom and Dad's house, but I got a cold and one of them is immunocompromised so we are going to do \"Thanksgiving\" later - possibly January. LoL\n\nHeck even here in my own house, since I haven't been feeling food, we did some food prep today (Thanksgiving Day) and we will do the turkey and big dinner tomorrow or Saturday. \n\nI always figured the idea was to spend time with family.\n\nNTA", "Your husband works in the medical field and they aren\u2019t willing to adjust a day or two? My mother was a nurse and worked double shifts on Christmas, new year, Easter, Mother\u2019s Day, you name it because she needed the money (single mom). Every single time we celebrated the day she had off that week (or weekend) before or after. It isn\u2019t about the date. People calling you the a\u2014-hole for prioritizing the money don\u2019t get it. You get paid more for working it but if you\u2019re scheduled, it\u2019s a black out day and you Can\u2019t take off.

The holiday is supposed to be about family, who cares if it is on the actual day or not?", "We have this endless argument with my MIL about Christmas. She is adamant we MUST see her on the day whereas it works better to see my family which is much bigger and harder to get everyone together. It\u2019s only her that we see on his side. Every year it turns into an argument about how we may as well not bother since we aren\u2019t seeing her on the actual day. I just don\u2019t get the attachment to the day, particularly when religion isn\u2019t a factor. \n\nI did enjoy when she was busy lecturing my other half how when he was little he attended 3 Xmas day celebrations and loved it and he looked at her in horror and said \u201cwhat childhood are you remembering? I hated that!\u201d", "If it was just you who would be going, I would feel differently, but your son counts here too. I'm gonna say YTA.

I think it\u2019s a little unreasonable to not pick a day in that long weekend that works for the majority (OP mentions Sunday would work for everyone).", "Er. Christmas Day is a Monday this year so you aren't entirely correct on that part that Christmas is never a Monday. It's wherever the 24th and 25th lands and this year is a Sun/Mon", "The world of medicine stops for no one.  Most places do rotate. But personally, I preferred to work Thanksgiving over Christmas.", "He makes triple time on thanksgiving and it\u2019s a huge boost leading into Christmas. Our son\u2019s birthday is only a few days after Christmas, so the extra money helps a lot.", "This is the best answer. This way they don\u2019t have to do nothing on Thanksgiving. A lot of families I know do two Thanksgivings, one that works for the the largest number of people to get together and celebrate. And one on  actual Thanksgiving Day.", "This is actually a fantastic idea - I never considered hosting our own for them. I wouldn\u2019t mind doing that at all. I doubt they would take us up on it or come, but if this happens again next year that\u2019s at least something I could try to do. Thank you!!", "To me, the important caveat is that they\u2019ve moved it for his sister but not him. And he can\u2019t get off this particular year even if he wanted to. I don\u2019t understand being a stickler for the day. I\u2019m lucky that neither my family nor my husbands are the \u201cdibs\u201d kind of family.", "He\u2019s not choosing to work this year, he\u2019s on the schedule. And he\u2019s on the schedule so that morons who flash fry turkeys and drive drunk don\u2019t die, so maybe his family could take that into account.", "It\u2019s weird that they\u2019ve moved it for another spouse of a child of theirs but not for him. His own parents are being weird. \n\nMedicine doesn\u2019t always just let you have all holidays off. He\u2019s NTA and neither is OP.", "You are absolutely correct and that is the only reason I\u2019m here questioning my choice. My husband left the choice up to me. I asked my son for his opinion and he said he felt bad going without his dad. If it were just me, I wouldn\u2019t care about any of this honestly.", "His parents, his grandmother who lives with them, his sister and her husband and kids. That\u2019s all. And all of these people are off not only on thanksgiving, but on the weekend as well.", "How A-hole-ish do you think it is when you go into an ER and there are doctors and nurses and lab techs and staff there because they were willing to shift their lives around to accommodate you?", "My son said he felt bad going if his dad could not. I did let him have an opinion on if we went or not. If it meant a lot to him, I would absolutely take him.", "I hope you never need medical care on a holiday.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why the actual date of any holiday is more important than the people at the gathering itself.  There are so many variables even if you all live close to each other so why not be flexible? \n\nIt seems like eating at set times instead of when everyone is hungry or available. \n\nI have a friend who is one of 5 kids who lives live across a number of states from  Vermont to Virginia so they do Christmas in July every year so that no one has to deal with flights during frantic times or long drives in winter weather. Christmas thus comes twice a year since of course they do their own at their respective homes. \n\nCompromise is meeting in the middle rather than being dictated by arbitrary dates, customs, or superstitions.", "Yeah, so is Independence Day (July 4). But they're never moved to the nearest Monday like Labor Day and Memorial Day.", "Thanksgiving date changes, but  it's always the 3rd Thursday of November.", "There's a difference between a Monday Holiday (i.e.: covered under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act) and one hat happens to fall on a Monday in a given year.", "One year when I was little, Christmas was on a Sunday. My grandfather was offered triple time to work. We all got up and opened presents a 5:00 am, had breakfast and he went to work. We also always have Thanksgiving on Friday. The day or time doesn\u2019t matter, only the people.", "Is your husband upset? I\u2018m retired but the first five years I worked at that company I worked on Christmas Day. I missed out because my niece was a small child & my parents & sister weren\u2019t going to delay that for their adult daughter/sister. If hubby would rather make the $ than have dinner with HIS family, I don\u2019t understand why you care so much. YTA", "So \u2026 year after year you choose money over family? And you want them to move Thanksgiving to accommodate your choice? Oh yeah, YTA", "So what you\u2019re saying is, your husband liked the money more than seeing his grandparents? You all couldn\u2019t pick up extra shifts over the other holidays or throughout the year?", "Well, sorry. YTA. It's your husband's choice to work Thanksgiving.  And those others may have plans on the weekends. If your husband gave a little, maybe so would his parents. But it's not reasonable to expect them to always schedule everyone around him.", "There\u2019s a difference between having to work because you\u2019re scheduled and choosing to work because you get triple pay. My mom was a nurse and then in social work. I totally know the sacrifices she had to make. She didn\u2019t expect us to change our lives for her though; we still celebrated on the holiday when she was scheduled or called in; then we celebrated with her when she was available. It\u2019s not fair to make everyone else change their life to accommodate one person.", "If the 25th is a Monday than Christmas is a Monday", "Today is part of his normal scheduled days - he would have been working regardless. Thanksgiving day/ Christmas Day / New Year\u2019s Day are not allowed to be scheduled off if it\u2019s your normal schedule. They have moved a holiday before for my sister in law - so yes, he\u2019s a little upset about it.", ">If hubby would rather make the $ than have dinner with HIS family, I don\u2019t understand why you care so much. YTA\n\nRIGHT? \n\nThis comment should be higher. And adding in that OP likes the triple money bit as well, so I'm not sure what \"principle\" she's standing on with this.", "Sorry, I wasn\u2019t clear on this. I\u2019ve updated my post to explain.", "Way to jump to conclusions.", "It\u2019s his regularly scheduled day to work. You\u2019re not allowed to request off Christmas Day / New Year\u2019s Day / thanksgiving day if you are normally scheduled to work that day (in this case, he always works Thursdays).", "If he works in emergency medicine, it's probably not his choice. The department *has* to be staffed.", "People need medical care on Thanksgiving too. Which means that lots of people are going to be at work instead of with their families, in order to protect the rest of us from dying. I\u2019m sure if he had a choice, he\u2019d love if illness and injury took a holiday today, but they don\u2019t, so every year, someone is going to be at work that day. And saving the dinner until he can be there is literally the least his family can do to support his important work.", "You're right Christmas Day is on a Monday this year.", "Yes, the point u/extinct_diplodocus is making is that Christmas is always observed on December 25, regardless of which day of the week it falls on. When it falls on Wednesday, we don't observe it on a Monday or a Friday to make it in to a long weekend. Holidays like Labor Day and Memorial Day are on a specific Monday of their respective months, the date is fluid.", "And this coming Christmas is on a Monday :)", "Clearly his parents like his sister significantly more.  NTA for not wanting to continue sweeping their blatant favoritism under the rug.", "You implied in another comment that he works because he makes triple time.", "She said in the comments that it's his choice 50% of the years, and on those years he still does.", "Sounds like it can\u2019t be!! /s", "Nail on the head :( it bothers me more than it bothers him.", "OR, she had only one year she couldn\u2019t make the holiday. It sounds like most years husband is choosing triple pay over spending holidays with family, rather than being naturally scheduled on that day. That would make anyone unlikely to want to change the date, if they were just doing it so someone else could make more money.", "Apologies, I wasn\u2019t clear. It is an important time for him to work because of triple time. This year was not his choice, and this is the year his family is being weird about it.", "And the other 50% of the years he\u2019s there so that someone else can be with their family without their patients dying. It\u2019s a noble thing he\u2019s doing, and his family should be more supportive.", "Then his family would\u2019ve adjusted for him the first year, which they didn\u2019t.", "Regardless of his family being weird about it,  they are still your son's grandparents. And your in-laws. So they are your family too. So yes, you should spend it with them, even if your husband can't make it. You said you get on with them, so it's not like we're talking about spending time with people you hate here. Unless you secretly can't stand being around them without your husband in tow.", "No. 50% of the time he is there because he has to be and  the other 50% of the years he is there because he gets paid tripple that day and it helps them to have money before Christmas. OP says that is the reason very explicitly in the comments. There is nothing noble about it. And they are as supportive as is reasonable. They are not asking him to stop, they are just not bending their plans around it.", "Gosh I miss the time when we realized that healthcare workers are crucial to the functioning of society and gave them a modicum of respect for half a minute.", "Gosh I miss the time when we realised that not rearranging things for everyone because someone wants to make triple pay one day is not the same as not giving a person a modicum of respect. \n\nWhat an asinine comment."]}
