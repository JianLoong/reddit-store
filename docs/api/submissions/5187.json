Although I'm close with him, I don't know his fianc\u00e9 very well since I currently live in another state. I've probably met her about 10 times give or take, and each time has been fine (cordial and friendly, but I'm not calling her just to chit chat). \n\nI was happy to receive an invitation to their engagement party. After accepting, I received a package in the mail from my SIL. It was an outfit (sweater, jeans, shoes, and jacket) from a fast fashion brand that looked pretty cobbled together (she left the price tags on them and they were all discounted). \n\nI texted asking her what the package was for, and she told me it was for me to wear to the party so I wouldn't upstage her. I asked her if other attendees received outfits, and she said no. I then asked her if I ever made her feel uncomfortable (because why else would she do this?), and she said no, but just wanted to \"make sure\" that I didn't look better than her. \n\nThe whole thing didn't sit right with me, and I told her I wasn't comfortable being the only person wearing the random outfit (it didn't even fit me well), and asked if I could maybe send her a photo of my outfit first for approval, or buy something myself that she liked. It was all no no no, so the day of I decided to just go with a similar outfit she picked, but in my own clothing (i.e. she sent me a blue sweater, so I wore a similar colored blue sweater but from my own collection). I made sure that I had no visible logos and did not bring one of my designer bags, opting for a simple tote. \n\nWhen she saw me, she was LIVID.  To the point that when she took me to the kitchen to ream me out. I told her she was being unreasonable, but she told me that because she's the bride, nothing could ever be \"unreasonable\" because it was her special day and her way or the highway. \n\nI decided to leave because I clearly wasn't welcome and she wouldn't be reasoned with, but on my way out she threw her iced coffee at me, ruining my sweater. \n\nI had originally promised my brother a $15,000 check as a wedding gift, but now told him that unless his fianc\u00e9 apologized and paid for a new sweater ($100) then I will not be attending their wedding nor giving them the check. \n\nThey're currently fighting. Some family members are on my side while others called me an AH for not just wearing the random outfit to make the bride happy. It's turning into a huge \"thing\" so I'm wondering if I'm the AH for the whole thing. I know I could have sat out of the event, but I wanted to be there for my brother.", "created_utc": 1671523763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqint5/aita_for_not_adhering_to_a_dress_code_at_a_bridal/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she tried to control what you wear and then got angry was bad enough but she then threw iced coffee on you?? You should have just done the same to her. It's bizarre how much importance people give to weddings and aesthetics and how much bridezillas get away with. You definitely shouldn't attend the wedding unless she apologises.

Unless she had a \"dress code\" for the entire guest list, it was unreasonable and unfair to expect you to wear something she chose so you wouldn't upstage her!  Sounds like she has a little bit of insecurity and a self-esteem issue, and that is HER issue to solve.  She was wrong, 100%.  Then to throw her iced coffee on you?!  She owes you both an apology for behaving badly, for taking a tantrum and throwing a coffee at you, which she should have known would stain.  She owes to either have the sweater professionally cleaned or owes for a new one.  13K is an enormous amount to give as a wedding gift.  After her treatment of you, and his lack of insisting that she make amends for her inappropriate behavior, I'd skip the wedding and send 10 bucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
