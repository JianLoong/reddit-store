I can be sympathetic to the mother for having that income taken away, but that does not create an obligation on someone else, particularly an 18 year old who is likely to still need support from parents.\n\nThere is certainly no legal obligation to continue payments. That said, if OP wants to help her out, that's certainly a possibility and a nice thing to do.  OP, if you do help, make sure it is 100% clear that you are NOT paying alimony and that payments will NOT continue, that your mother is going to have to take responsibility for herself.

I do think that it might be fair to give her a cut off point because she was expecting another 6 years of this, sure it was a bad idea to just rely on that but this might be a compromise you can work with, after all it's not like you have the income to keep up the payments just the money", "NAH. That said she is your mom and she was under the impression she'd get them for 10 years. Consider help her get on her feet.

Of course, it goes without saying you should consult a lawyer.", "I think a short term loan would have been a reasonable request if that's what she had asked for.

Do NOT pay her a dime until you consult with an actual lawyer. Otherwise you risk her pulling a nasty trick like that on you. Your dad died recently and you\u2019re young.

If you can find the details of the alimony agreement look at them to see if there is any kind of stipulation that payment continue after death of the payer.

Plenty of people who could pursue an at fault don\u2019t because of that. A court is not going to make the divorce into an at fault unless that is what the parties want.", "Fine... if she only got alimony because her circumstances ticked enough boxes such that it was a possible outcome within the law that she receive alimony, so be it. OP's father paid that out to her diligently for four entire years.\n\nRight now, OP's situation ticks enough boxes such that it is a lawful outcome for them to cut payments to their egg donor entirely. Fair is fair, OP does not owe the woman who destroyed their family and who did not raise them for the past 4 years a cent.", "I do wish alimony judgements would take into account the potential receiver\u2019s future potential at the time of the marriage: some people (women and men both) who receive alimony never were gonna be worth what they get as alimony, if you catch my drift.", "That depends entirely on the local laws. My state does not allow fault to be considered in splitting the marital estate but does allow fault to be a factor in setting alimony.", "A guy I used to work beside had this as an alternative:\n\nAway outside and throw shite at yerself.\n\nLegendary imo. He was Irish.", "NTA. You owe her nothing then from the estate and she took the gravy train for granted, okay mother or not.", "Give her a couple months then cut off the money. That should give her ample time to get her affairs in order, then you wouldn\u2019t have to feel bad for whatever may come after. A lot of people would consider than more than generous considering the affair.", "NTA and don\u2019t give her anymore. She had more than enough time to find a job. \n\nShe\u2019s an adult, you\u2019re her child. You should not be paying for her. She\u2019s supposed to help you out.", "She had plenty time to save, she basically got 60k a year for nothing, the mind boggles.\n\nRe firm your message that the money has now stopped, she is on her own, or with whoever she is with now.\n\nmy condolences for the loss of your dad\n\nNTA", "That baffles me so often in these stories. I get that some people barely scrape by as it is. But a lot of people seem to think, nothing ever changes and don't invest in life insurance, education, employment possibilities etc and cry when something happens. The money and time spent living their best lives and getting a lot of children they can no longer feed.", "We don't know where OP lives, but in some places yes. OP's Dad promised/was ordered to pay alimony for 10 years and in a lot of cases that's a debt that the estate owes just like a mortgage.", "The odds are pretty good that if you aren\u2019t very careful now, if you start giving stuff you\u2019ll never stop. :(", "I don\u2019t actually disagree with that but anyone having their source of income cut off suddenly will struggle. I am not saying he should always support her but there is a massive space between paying alimony and cutting her off suddenly and giving her a little help until she is standing on her own two feet. \n\nHe could agree to help for a fixed period of time to allow her to get a job, he did say she had been a good mum to him.", "OP refers to her as an ok mother, so while she's obviously not winning any awards, referring to her as the 'egg donor' seems over the top. It's not as though she gave birth and then bailed.", "No don't give any money. If he does then she will start asking for one more month, one more month and it will never end. Better to say no now and stick to it.", "She was getting 60000 a year and saved none of it.  That is on her.", "OP claimed she was an OK mom, but I do see your point. My concern is that the mom now just expects to live off of her son for at least the next six years (and maybe after that as well). Maybe half payments for half a year to get things in order for her, so instead of 60k over a year, she gets 15k over 6 months, but let it be known there will be no more subsidizing her life after that.", "Counterpoint: It's entirely OP's money and they can do whatever they want with it. If they decide to continue paying alimony, so be it. If they decide that what the mother did to the dad was terrible and has gone unpunished for too long that it outweighs her being a mediocre but not abusive mother so the mom deserves no money now, so be it as well.", "> Maybe half payments for half a year to get things in order for her, so instead of 60k over a year, she gets 15k over 6 months, but let it be known there will be no more subsidizing her life after that.\n\nOP, don\u2019t do this without (a) talking to a lawyer unconnected with your mother to make sure that this wouldn\u2019t give her an opening to demand more, and (b) getting her to sign whatever needs to be signed to establish that any money you are giving her is a gift, not an entitlement on her part.", "Oh I definitely agree to consult a lawyer. I was just spitballing an idea if, for whatever reason, OP does decide to help the mom. I wouldn't, but that's just me."]}
