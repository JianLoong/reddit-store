It was December of 2022.\nShe was coming at my door (i live with my boyfriend)begging me to sleep in a guest room which of course i couldn't say no to. She was saying he doesn't answer her texts, he is ignoring her and being mean when she tried to talk and had cheated on his ex in the past. I advised her to stop dating him since it has only been 2 weeks. But she said she loves him so much. \n\nTo make this story a bit shorter ( i can write a book on this) she became delusional. She moved in with him. She didn't leave his side, she left college for him so they can move to Sweden (thats what he promised they will do and ofc they didnt he manipulated her). He manipulated her into thinking she is psychotic and mentally ill and that she needs to change. He told her our family wants to ruin her life and she should cut us off, which she contemplates. She became obsessed with him to the point that she moved in with him and he kicked her out because \"he cant stand to live with her\u201d.\n\nShe recently started providing for her and J. He called her one night and begged her to come back to live with him. Now my sister pays the bills and food from her minimum wage job while he does nothing. It was the last straw. I told her during out conversation that he is awful, and many other bad words. I told her everything I think of him and tried to show her what he is doing. I said that she should leave him, that it hurts me and our family. She got mad and defensive, protecting him. After 30 minutes she slammed the door of my apartment and left.Now she refuses to talk to me and our whole family. I feel guilty\u2026 Should i have done this? Should i have kept my mouth shut?

All you can do is keep the door open and be there for her when she sees the light.", "NTA - she needed to hear it. But you may have isolated her from you and the family by saying it, so you may want to reach out to make it clear that you will still be there if/when she chooses to leave. So she knows she has somewhere to go and doesn\u2019t have to stay", "The epitomy of coercive control and emotional abuse by this guy and well done for calling it out. The problem is that your sister is so programmed by this guy she will defend him until something really bad happens or she finally sees the problem. Don't stop calling him put, leave the door open for her. NTA", "Definitely NTA but you should try and help her too. Stuff like this happens and being so close to her you know what\u2019s it like. Save her from a spot she may not be able to get out of", "INFO: You said he kicked her out, but is she back living with him since she's \"providing\" for him? This all sounds super fishy.", "NTA. You are absolutely right to encourage her to leave this loser. But unfortunately this will need to play out. She is under his spell.  Just let her know you will always be there for her.  Hopefully, she will find the dignity to leave him.", "NTA \n\nHowever, next time you may try to see things from her perspective and approach it in a more diplomatic way. Insulting someone she claims to love (even if he deserves it) won\u2019t change her mind. Quite the opposite, it fuels *his* narrative that her family is a negative force in her life. \n\nThis is not about being right or wrong, this is about communicating the message in a constructive way.", "NTA. Who else would encourage her out of an awful situation like that? And convince her that you're still there for her? It's definitely a tricky discussion to have, but it has to be done and it sounds like you tried to be respectful of her.", "NTA but I was in a similar situation a few years ago. At the time I missed the red flags. Eventually I wised up to what a narcissistic bastard he really was, but by then I had physical and mental scars from my time in his clutches. I still am traumatised by some of things and do not wish to elaborate but it couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse than it did at the time. You\u2019ve done the right thing by telling your sister what you perceive to be a bad / dangerous situation but it will just take more time, people who are being a**sed will often go back to a tormentor many times. Let your sister know you are there for her though, please don\u2019t let her feel like she\u2019s got nobody to turn to like I felt at the time. Let other people know, the authorities in some countries let you check to see if someone had been abusive or violent in the past.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am second hand scared for her. She\u2019s with a clean cut case of narcissism and when you\u2019re deep in like that there\u2019s nothing you can say to change her mind. She\u2019s going to have to realize it on her own.", "NTA and there is nothing you could do at the moment. She will have to make this mistake on her own. Let her know you're there for her when she lands on her ass (and once that comes around, keep the \"I told you so\"s to yourself, even if they are tempting). You can't save someone who does not want to see that they are being drowned.", "Definitely NTA \n\nOne is free to make their choices, but one is not free from the consequences of said choices. \n\nMaybe have a calm conversation with her, and explain where you\u2019re coming from and why you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying, all the while making sure that your tone is compassionate and that she see\u2019s you are speaking with love, with no vested interest other than her own well being. \n\nAfter that, let her know you\u2019re always there for her. \n\nSome people can\u2019t be saved. \n\nMy sister and I had a similar conversation 10 years ago. Last year, after years of domestic violence, multiple burns, a kid and a few police complaints later, I helped her file for divorce and custody. That\u2019s still ongoing. \n\nSometimes that\u2019s all you can do.", "Sounds a lot like the situation with my sister and both her ex bf and current husband.", "I'm so so sorry. Its agonizing watching someone you love stay in an abusive relationship. \n\nThere isn't much you can do until she's ready, but you can have resources ready to help her when she's ready to break away from him. \n\nI so hope she gets it soon. For all your families sake.", "Update when the true crime forensic files episode comes out plz.", "YTA you reacted in the worst possible way, confirming all his lies. He managed to manipulate you as well indirectly, and you unfortunately played right in his hand. It\u2019s hard to do, but the best is to remain calm and show concern and lead her to through questions and conversation to reach the correct conclusion on her own.", "NTA. No  pity for the tarnished", "Being mad at her did not help. Saying you will always be there to listen and that you are sad that she is a shell of who she was is more accurate.", "NTA, but you may have inadvertently played right into his hands, helping him to isolate her from her family. This is a tough issue. Some helpful resources here: https://www.thehotline.org/ Good luck!", "NTA.\nIt's a difficult situation, your sister is in an abusive relationship and only time will tell if it will turn physical.\nI would let her be, because she won't listen to you.\nBut send her a message that she can always come back and crash in the guest room of things get bad.\nTo show her that you will support her no matter what, but you won't support him.", "NTA. She is forever dumping problems he causes on you, what can she expect?", "NTA.  Unfortunately, she is going to have to see the manipulative, abusive & gaslighting behavior on her own.  I doubt there is anything you could do or say that would get her away from him.  You will only make her cling to him even more.  Been there.  The more you say, the harder she will cling.", "Agreed, NTA. Although, there are more diplomatic ways you could have approached the situation. Keep reaching out to your sister and support her in any way you can, she will need time to cool off.", "Exactly! Tough situation, NTA, just keep the door open for her.", "He kicked her out and for around 2 weeks she has lived with our parents. After that time, he randomly called her around 10 pm apologizing and asking her to move back in and she accepted. He told her he doesnt have money and cant work since he travels to Sweden often to see his ill grandma. So she started providing for him and still is.", "You are right. I will work on it. Thank you so much", "NTA\n\nYour sister is being played. Sad thing is, she will likely have to reach that conclusion on her own before she wakes up."]}
