I advised her to stop dating him since it has only been 2 weeks. But she said she loves him so much. \n\nTo make this story a bit shorter ( i can write a book on this) she became delusional. She moved in with him. She didn't leave his side, she left college for him so they can move to Sweden (thats what he promised they will do and ofc they didnt he manipulated her). He manipulated her into thinking she is psychotic and mentally ill and that she needs to change. He told her our family wants to ruin her life and she should cut us off, which she contemplates.

All you can do is keep the door open and be there for her when she sees the light.", "NTA - she needed to hear it. But you may have isolated her from you and the family by saying it, so you may want to reach out to make it clear that you will still be there if/when she chooses to leave. So she knows she has somewhere to go and doesn\u2019t have to stay", "The epitomy of coercive control and emotional abuse by this guy and well done for calling it out. The problem is that your sister is so programmed by this guy she will defend him until something really bad happens or she finally sees the problem. Don't stop calling him put, leave the door open for her. NTA", "Definitely NTA but you should try and help her too. Stuff like this happens and being so close to her you know what\u2019s it like. Save her from a spot she may not be able to get out of", "INFO: You said he kicked her out, but is she back living with him since she's \"providing\" for him? This all sounds super fishy.", "NTA. You are absolutely right to encourage her to leave this loser. But unfortunately this will need to play out. She is under his spell.  Just let her know you will always be there for her.  Hopefully, she will find the dignity to leave him.", "NTA \n\nHowever, next time you may try to see things from her perspective and approach it in a more diplomatic way. Insulting someone she claims to love (even if he deserves it) won\u2019t change her mind. Quite the opposite, it fuels *his* narrative that her family is a negative force in her life. \n\nThis is not about being right or wrong, this is about communicating the message in a constructive way.", "NTA. Who else would encourage her out of an awful situation like that? And convince her that you're still there for her? It's definitely a tricky discussion to have, but it has to be done and it sounds like you tried to be respectful of her.", "NTA but I was in a similar situation a few years ago. At the time I missed the red flags. Eventually I wised up to what a narcissistic bastard he really was, but by then I had physical and mental scars from my time in his clutches. I still am traumatised by some of things and do not wish to elaborate but it couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse than it did at the time. You\u2019ve done the right thing by telling your sister what you perceive to be a bad / dangerous situation but it will just take more time, people who are being a**sed will often go back to a tormentor many times. Let your sister know you are there for her though, please don\u2019t let her feel like she\u2019s got nobody to turn to like I felt at the time. Let other people know, the authorities in some countries let you check to see if someone had been abusive or violent in the past.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am second hand scared for her. She\u2019s with a clean cut case of narcissism and when you\u2019re deep in like that there\u2019s nothing you can say to change her mind. She\u2019s going to have to realize it on her own.", "NTA and there is nothing you could do at the moment. She will have to make this mistake on her own. Let her know you're there for her when she lands on her ass (and once that comes around, keep the \"I told you so\"s to yourself, even if they are tempting). You can't save someone who does not want to see that they are being drowned.", "Definitely NTA \n\nOne is free to make their choices, but one is not free from the consequences of said choices. \n\nMaybe have a calm conversation with her, and explain where you\u2019re coming from and why you\u2019re saying what you\u2019re saying, all the while making sure that your tone is compassionate and that she see\u2019s you are speaking with love, with no vested interest other than her own well being. \n\nAfter that, let her know you\u2019re always there for her. \n\nSome people can\u2019t be saved. \n\nMy sister and I had a similar conversation 10 years ago. Last year, after years of domestic violence, multiple burns, a kid and a few police complaints later, I helped her file for divorce and custody. That\u2019s still ongoing. \n\nSometimes that\u2019s all you can do.", "Sounds a lot like the situation with my sister and both her ex bf and current husband.", "I'm so so sorry. Its agonizing watching someone you love stay in an abusive relationship. \n\nThere isn't much you can do until she's ready, but you can have resources ready to help her when she's ready to break away from him. \n\nI so hope she gets it soon. For all your families sake.", "Update when the true crime forensic files episode comes out plz.", "YTA you reacted in the worst possible way, confirming all his lies. He managed to manipulate you as well indirectly, and you unfortunately played right in his hand. It\u2019s hard to do, but the best is to remain calm and show concern and lead her to through questions and conversation to reach the correct conclusion on her own.", "NTA. No  pity for the tarnished", "Being mad at her did not help. Saying you will always be there to listen and that you are sad that she is a shell of who she was is more accurate.", "NTA, but you may have inadvertently played right into his hands, helping him to isolate her from her family. This is a tough issue. Some helpful resources here: https://www.thehotline.org/ Good luck!", "NTA.\nIt's a difficult situation, your sister is in an abusive relationship and only time will tell if it will turn physical.\nI would let her be, because she won't listen to you.\nBut send her a message that she can always come back and crash in the guest room of things get bad.\nTo show her that you will support her no matter what, but you won't support him.", "NTA. She is forever dumping problems he causes on you, what can she expect?", "NTA.  Unfortunately, she is going to have to see the manipulative, abusive & gaslighting behavior on her own.  I doubt there is anything you could do or say that would get her away from him.  You will only make her cling to him even more.  Been there.  The more you say, the harder she will cling.", "Agreed, NTA. Although, there are more diplomatic ways you could have approached the situation. Keep reaching out to your sister and support her in any way you can, she will need time to cool off.", "Exactly! Tough situation, NTA, just keep the door open for her.", "He kicked her out and for around 2 weeks she has lived with our parents. After that time, he randomly called her around 10 pm apologizing and asking her to move back in and she accepted. He told her he doesnt have money and cant work since he travels to Sweden often to see his ill grandma. So she started providing for him and still is.", "You are right. I will work on it. Thank you so much", "NTA\n\nYour sister is being played. Sad thing is, she will likely have to reach that conclusion on her own before she wakes up.", "NTA. She's in an abusive relationship and still in denial about it. One of the main tactics of abusers is to cause rifts with their friends and family in order to isolate them. Give her a little time, then reach out, apologize (even though you're right), and see if she'll talk to you. Keep reaching out even if she doesn't respond. The best thing you can do is stay in her life or keep the door open so that she knows when she's ready she will have help and support. If she starts talking to you about him, don't say anything about him unless she does. Just listen, nod, and respond at the level that she's giving you. If she's positive about him, be non-committal. \"It's nice that he made dinner for you\". If she's mad at something he's done, validate her anger but don't show more anger than she does. She will need you when she's ready to leave, but if she feels like she's gonna hear an \"I told you so\" from you, she'll avoid you.", "I don't know that you are an AH, but you just pushed her further into his arms--He wanted her isolated from her family-and you just provided the impetus.\n\nI'm sorry, but all you can do for her at this point is TRY to be there for her when she comes to her senses.  You really cannot do anything to help her at this point as she is so completely mind-f\\*cked that there is nothing you can say that will change her mind.", "NTA but you must be careful and thoughtful when helping someone in an emotionally abusive relationship. It would be beneficial to do some research on best methods of assistance and communication with victims.", "NTA and I am so sorry. I\u2019ve been watching a guy do similar things to my sister, on a smaller scale since they\u2019re both still in high school but it is absolutely sickening to watch. Unfortunately with abuse and trauma bonding, it\u2019s extremely common for victims to blame their loved ones instead of the abuser for awhile to protect the image of the abuser they have in their head. And with his attempts to isolate her, it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s automatically blaming you. Keep right on loving her but you may want to switch to just emotionally supporting her when she does come to you. By attacking him, deserved as it may be, it just fuels his ability to convince her YOU are bad. But if you\u2019re just a safe place for her to go, when she finally wakes up to what an asshole he is, she\u2019ll know she can come to you.", "Your sister is being abused. I don't mean that in a reddit hyperbole way, I mean that what you are describing fits within the legal and clinical definitions of domestic abuse.\n\nThis is very tricky, because showing anger towards her and even just badmouthing him can further isolate her, and make it seem like what he's saying is true. \n\nYou're NTA, far from it, but you and your parents need to speak to a professional about how to properly support your sister in this situation.", "Maybe controversial, but YTA. Obviously the dude is the biggest asshole here. However, he's been saying you and your family will ruin her life, and now she feels like you are, totally playing into what he is saying. He sounds abusive and is intentionally trying to isolate her to gain more control. Though that may have been my knee jerk reaction to show what a trash person he is, best practice for people in abusive situations is to support your sister, try to keep your opinions on the boyfriend to a minimum and make it clear you will be there for her. If the boyfriend doesn't want her to see you, it doesn't sound like she will. As awful as that is, some access to her to support her through this is better than not knowing how she is. On average it takes 7 tries before someone leaves their abuser. \n\nHere's a resource from the National Domestic Violence Hotline to help guide your conversations with your sister: https://www.thehotline.org/support-others/ways-to-support-a-domestic-violence-survivor/", "My bet is he has another gf he leeches off of", "NTA. You\u2019re not an asshole, and I completely understand why you reacted the way you did, but unfortunately it\u2019s not the best strategy for getting her to leave him. \n\nHe\u2019s been telling her that you all are awful and mean and want her to be unhappy. When you blow up like that, you give him a chance to say \u201cSee?\u201d and say that you\u2019re trying to sabbotage her relationship because you\u2019re jealous or want her to be unhappy or whatever shit he can make up. That hurts your credibility when you try to help her in the future. \n\nAlso, think about how you would react if someone called your boyfriend awful. You\u2019d be pretty offended, right? Just because in her case it\u2019s totally true doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t feel the same way. If you\u2019re insulting her boyfriend, she probably feels like you\u2019re insulting her for being with him by extension. No one wants to be the poor, stupid girl with the shitty boyfriend that everyone else knew was shitty before she did. \n\nIt really, really sucks, but unfortunately you have to play the long game here. You have to support her and validate her feelings without telling her what to do or insulting him until she puts it all together and decided to leave on her own. Do not give him a chance to convince her to cut you out of her life.", "This is my strategy I\u2019ve used with friends before as well. Worked 2 out of 2 times. Be their backup not their guide.", "She\u2019ll be back cuz this guy sounds like a loser, and them breaking up again is inevitable. It\u2019s just going to take a bit longer for her to see it", "NTA, this isn't really a question about being an AH but rather getting the right resources to help your sister (if possible). She is in an abusive situation. Best of luck."]}
