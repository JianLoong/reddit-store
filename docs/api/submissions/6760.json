All of the kids are younger than me, 9 and under. \n\nAnd more family lives across the street, My great Aunt(50), her 2 daughters(30) and (26), and her granddaughter(6), the daughter of 26. And also the younger daughter\u2019s boyfriend (26)\n\nThe younger daughter across the street (26), is one of the more sexual people, when this topic came up on my great aunt\u2019s birthday, the 26 year old said she got a toy from her mom at 14 so she\u2019s surprised I haven\u2019t gotten one yet.\n\nSorry if this is confusing.

They're adults saying those things to a minor!! It sounds like it has been going on for years and that's terrifying. Honestly, I'll go even a step further: report them to your child service. I doubt they'll stop at you and they're gonna do it to the younger kids too. Edit: Please make sure to collect behavior of this evidence, too, if possible.
