We are going to be moving out in May because that\u2019s the only time an apartment is available in our price range. We currently pay my parents 600 in rent. 7 months ago my 17 year old brother got into a car accident and has been in a coma ever since. My dad and my brother had to transfer to a hospital 2 hours away. While there my dad befriended a homeless man and even brought him up to the hospital room so he can help take care of my brother. My mom refused to help. About a month ago my dad came home to stay the night and brought the man with him. The biggest red flag of all is that he stole 6 of my mothers anxiety medications. Well now my dad is back home for good because my brother transferred to a local rehabilitation center and of course he brought this homeless man to come stay with us. Apparently my mom wants to give him another chance. My dad said he has a wife and child 1000 miles away and he\u2019s supposed to go back to them soon. I just feel so uncomfortable. He seems like a nice man but I don\u2019t even like interacting with strangers out in public because of social anxiety never mind where I live. Plus for the fact that I have a 2 year old daughter who he says he wants to take for a walk to the park. Like there\u2019s no way I would ever let that happen. He\u2019s living in the living room and I feel uncomfortable to go out there. It\u2019s hard to be stuck in a room with a toddler.

Except for family and close friends, in 99% of the cases NOBODY wants to spend time with a toddler unless they are a). Paid to do so (babysitters) or b). Don\u2019t have the best intentions. \nI\u2019m not going to comment on your living situation as I\u2019m an introvert and I will never understand why would someone share their hone with a stranger unless forced to do so (but that\u2019s just me!!!). I\u2019m just going to say - and you already know this, you\u2019ve said it loud and clear - you are perfectly right to be freaked out by the fact a grown up man with no connections to you wants to take your kid to the park.", "NTA. I would not want to have my child in that situation either. The park thing makes me very uneasy too. I hope you can find another situation for your family, or that your parents would reconsider and pick you and their grandchild to stay rather than this stranger.", "NTA\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 have a daughter to take care of because her safety is important (and yours too).\n\nYou and your family literally don't know this man, and he immediately stole drugs from your mom. I wonder what else he stole.\n\nI hope you are able to move out soon.", "NTA. Can't see the grass for all the red flags. Got a name? Check him out online. No the guy needs to go. His request to take your daughter out alone is too much. Also if he has family why can't he go to them now? Offer to help pay for a ticket. Trains are not expensive.", "NTA, in my opinion, you don't know this man, and neither does anyone else, your daughter's safety should be everyone's number 1 priority. Doesn't seem like your parents care about safety.", "NTA. Spend the $600 rent in April and stay in an extended stay until you can get into your new apartment.", "NTA. Have you checked to see if he\u2019s on the registry.", "Is there any other place you can stay until the apartment is available? 6 weeks is a long time to live in a situation that feels highly unsafe.\n\nNTA.\n\nI'm all for helping people but none of you know this guy.", "I know this is a very odd situation", "NTA. You pay rent there, you should have a say. And you have every right to worry about your child\u2019s safety around a strange man. Also\u2026.your dad met him at the hospital and took him to your brother\u2019s room to help??? Help with what??? This is so weird", "NTA. You might be TA if you just didn\u2019t want a stranger living in the same house and tried to get him kicked out, since your parents are the homeowners, not you, but you have EVERY RIGHT to feel unease in this situation.\n\nThe guy steals medication from your family (either to sell or use) and wants to be alone with your child!? The frick?\n\nYou don\u2019t have the right to get him out of the house, but you need to leave as soon as possible.", "NTA. It does sound like a sketchy and uncomfortable situation and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem with voicing your feelings about it. You are paying rent and didn\u2019t expect a random man to be staying in your living room. I can understand why you\u2019d feel even more uncomfortable having him there with your daughter living there too. Hopefully they can help him get back to his family soon.", "NTA omg. As the mother of a 2 year old I would be so unbelievably uncomfortable. This man is a stranger and your baby is being put in an extremely vulnerable situation. I'm so anxious just thinking about it. What is your dad thinking? UGH.", "You should trust your gut on this. A random man offering to take your two year old to the park is beyond creepy. Even if he had only good intentions, what kind of idiot wouldn\u2019t understand how creepy that is? Please install a lock on your door, and use the money you would pay your parents for rent to live somewhere else. Your parents wanting to let this man back into their home when he promptly stole your mother\u2019s meds is insane. Living with a friend of a friend or going into debt staying at an extended stay hotel for a couple months is a much better idea than staying in this situation. Hell, go to a random local charity or religious community and ask for help. Your parents are showing shockingly bad judgement and no concern for the safety of their grandchild. NTA obviously.", "NTA - these are your parents, you should be allowed to tell them how you feel.\n\nEither way, consider investing in locks and cameras for your living spaces.", "NTA - trust your instincts and keep your daughter safe.", "This is just plain weird like your dad is bringing home a boyfriend or something. There is definitely more to the story than they are letting on. You could always tell your parents that you will just pay them $300 for rent since the new tenant should pay his half. Is it an asshole move? Yes, but what does it matter if you are already the asshole?", "NTA\n\nStole your mom's anxiety medication.\n\nNope.  He's not nice.   Keep him at arm's length and watch your child at all times.\n\nWhat does your fiance say about this?  Your parents are TA.  They know nothing about this dude.    You need to find out who he really is (check online).\n\nSorry about the situation.  Can you move?\n\nPlease update on the situation.", "Him wanting to take your toddler to the park is just creepy. I would not leave him alone with your child for any amount of time. \n\nYou were not wrong for expressing your concerns to your parents. Unfortunately, you cannot force him out as it isn\u2019t your house, but you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA for the situation. Maybe reconsider the way you talk about homeless people with more respect because you never know someone\u2019s circumstances \nBUT in this context it\u2019s entirely relevant to you and your daughters safety. \n\nHe is an entirely anonymous person. Usually there is some context to relationships- \u201cmy dads friend from his softball league\u201d \u201cmom\u2019s coworker\u201d is sleeping on the couch- there is some degree of familiarity and accountability. If he was arrested for assault, his place of work would have known that. If he had a home and was a sex offender- he would have to register. Not to say these familiar people couldn\u2019t also harm your daughter, but there is some form of background check in other relationships. \n\nAlso as you are paying rent you should have some say. There are resources and places for him to stay, especially with your fathers help. There are group homes. He could get a job at a care agency and become your brothers caregiver in a legal capacity. There are other options that can help him AND make you feel safe. It\u2019s not about him as a person, but the risk is too high. \n\nYour parents are thinking with their hearts but not their heads.", "NAH.  He may be a stranger to you. But to your parents, who own the house your family is living in, he's the man who helped care for your comatose brother for an important bit of time. \n\nI get it that you couldn't go visit and/or help care for your brother.  But had you gone to where he was, you would have had an opportunity to get to know this man the same as your father. \n\nI'm saying that NAH because each of you -- you and your parents -- is judging this individual based on your interactions with him. In your case, your primary concern is for your young child.  In your parents' case, it's to repay someone who helped them during their time of need. \n\nI'd say to move out of your parents home as soon as you can. In the meantime,  getting to know this stranger might help you meet the person who your father got to know.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s something really off-putting about how one-dimensionally you characterize this person: \u201ca homeless man\u201d. You say he\u2019s nice enough, but he\u2019s \u201ca homeless man\u201d, with the implication being that he\u2019s inherently dangerous and has a very low ceiling on how inherently good, worthy, or valuable he could actually be. It\u2019s dehumanizing. You\u2019re every bit as homeless as he is at the moment.", "YTA\n\nIt ain't your house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
