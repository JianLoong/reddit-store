We currently pay my parents 600 in rent. 7 months ago my 17 year old brother got into a car accident and has been in a coma ever since. My dad and my brother had to transfer to a hospital 2 hours away. While there my dad befriended a homeless man and even brought him up to the hospital room so he can help take care of my brother. My mom refused to help. About a month ago my dad came home to stay the night and brought the man with him. The biggest red flag of all is that he stole 6 of my mothers anxiety medications. Well now my dad is back home for good because my brother transferred to a local rehabilitation center and of course he brought this homeless man to come stay with us. Apparently my mom wants to give him another chance. My dad said he has a wife and child 1000 miles away and he\u2019s supposed to go back to them soon. I just feel so uncomfortable. He seems like a nice man but I don\u2019t even like interacting with strangers out in public because of social anxiety never mind where I live. Plus for the fact that I have a 2 year old daughter who he says he wants to take for a walk to the park. Like there\u2019s no way I would ever let that happen. He\u2019s living in the living room and I feel uncomfortable to go out there. It\u2019s hard to be stuck in a room with a toddler.

Your parents wanting to let this man back into their home when he promptly stole your mother\u2019s meds is insane. Living with a friend of a friend or going into debt staying at an extended stay hotel for a couple months is a much better idea than staying in this situation.

Maybe reconsider the way you talk about homeless people with more respect because you never know someone\u2019s circumstances \nBUT in this context it\u2019s entirely relevant to you and your daughters safety. \n\nHe is an entirely anonymous person. Usually there is some context to relationships- \u201cmy dads friend from his softball league\u201d \u201cmom\u2019s coworker\u201d is sleeping on the couch- there is some degree of familiarity and accountability. If he was arrested for assault, his place of work would have known that. If he had a home and was a sex offender- he would have to register. Not to say these familiar people couldn\u2019t also harm your daughter, but there is some form of background check in other relationships. \n\nAlso as you are paying rent you should have some say. There are resources and places for him to stay, especially with your fathers help. There are group homes. He could get a job at a care agency and become your brothers caregiver in a legal capacity. There are other options that can help him AND make you feel safe. It\u2019s not about him as a person, but the risk is too high. \n\nYour parents are thinking with their hearts but not their heads.", "NAH.  He may be a stranger to you.

But had you gone to where he was, you would have had an opportunity to get to know this man the same as your father. \n\nI'm saying that NAH because each of you -- you and your parents -- is judging this individual based on your interactions with him. In your case, your primary concern is for your young child.  In your parents' case, it's to repay someone who helped them during their time of need. \n\nI'd say to move out of your parents home as soon as you can. In the meantime,  getting to know this stranger might help you meet the person who your father got to know.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s something really off-putting about how one-dimensionally you characterize this person: \u201ca homeless man\u201d. You say he\u2019s nice enough, but he\u2019s \u201ca homeless man\u201d, with the implication being that he\u2019s inherently dangerous and has a very low ceiling on how inherently good, worthy, or valuable he could actually be.
