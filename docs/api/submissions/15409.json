Gina also has a job, I'll try to get her into this new company I work with now since they pay more than what she's making now.

However now we're planning a short trip to destress from work and she wants me to pay for everything since I have savings and she doesn't. She said she spent all her money on the wedding stuff and since we're a couple I shouldn't mind paying for her. I told her she should pay with the money she saves each month for personal stuff since a trip is also something \"personal\" (not a necessity) then she got upset and said that splitting was stupid when we were about to get married. \n\n\nWe argued and she kept saying she won't cut money off her personal stuff expenses since she needs that. She called me an asshole and greedy. I told her that I was not ok with being her piggybank and that if she can't pay for the trip then maybe she shouldn't go (I said this so she'll accept to pay herself) then she blew off at me because I'll rather go alone then pay for her. She got upset and left to her mom's house. She came back the day after but now she said I either pay for her to go, or leave alone and forget about the wedding.

You need to get in the same page financially immediately, otherwise don\u2019t bother getting married", "ESH.\n\nIt doesn't have to be all you paying, and it doesn't have to be her paying half when she makes so much less than you. In general, if a married/long-term couple doesn't merge their finances, it's recommended that they pay by percentage of income. This goes for all household expenses like a mortgage and utilities and groceries, and I think it's fair to use the same general rule for vacations. So, if you make $100,000 and she makes $50,000, then you should pay for 2/3 of the trip and she should pay for 1/3. So if the trip is $3,000, you're paying $2,000 in this scenario, and she's paying $1,000. You're paying based on income. FWIW, it should probably be the same split for the wedding. If you make twice as much as her, are you paying for 2/3 of the wedding costs?\n\nIf you don't have any major assets or major debts at this stage in your life (like one of you doesn't own a house already or something), then I'm a pretty big advocate for married couples merging finances and making financial decisions together, including making a budget. It takes away this idea of your money vs. her money. In my view, a marriage isn't just a romantic relationship but also like a business partnership. I view my husband as someone on my team, and we make financial decisions together because it's *our* money. So, compared to the scenario above, we wouldn't have to worry that he makes $100,000 a year and I make $50,000 and we need to split 2/3 and 1/3. Instead, it's just a \"We make $150,000/year\" attitude. It's merged.", "NAH but you need to figure your finances out immediately or this is going to be an issue forever. Combining or separating are both legitimate strategies - you just need to agree beforehand. \n\nIMO though...why get married at all if you're unwilling to combine finances? Not that money makes the marriage, but isn't it supposed to be all about literally sharing a life together? Why is money the one exception? At the very least, combining is a whole lot simpler than constantly calculating the correct ratios, stressing over who pays for what, etc.", "ESH!

She just spent her fun money on fun things and now expects you to bankroll the trip.\n\nIf you never discussed having joint finances, she doesn't get to pull that out of thin air when it benefits her. The fuck is her behavior?? No discussion, no openes about her finances. Just an emotional tantrum, bouncing and then threatening to call off the wedding. That is not how a grown-up communicates. That's a blackmail. Nothing got resolved with you just giving in. Either you go all in and join the finances, no matter who makes more at any point in your lives. Or you do % according to your incomes for everything. So if you at this point make 20% more than her, you pay for 20% for the trip.", "NTA and here is the one small point that shows me why.

What she really meant was that she wants to share your money but keep hers to herself.  That\u2019s a huge marriage red flag to me and should be settled before the wedding.\n\nMy wife and I share all of our money equally.  We have one checking account, one savings account, one credit card, are both on the mortgage, etc.  We are both pretty responsible when it comes to money so it works.

I do 95% of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, meal planning, budgeting, etc.", "Thank goodness I have a husband who is not an AH and knows that my job is just as valuable as his. (He says it's more valuable). When he got a $100k (after taxes) award, I told him to buy something for him...nope... he paid off OUR house and we took a trip as a family.", "Theyre getting married. You want your partner to be happy and as comfortable as you are. If you are rolling in cash and your partner doesnt earn enough to put away any savings while not spending frivously, if youre ok to stand back and watch that while doing nothing to help then you shouldnt be in a relationship with that person.", "but OP isn't paying more. they're making more and saving it, while still paying the same thing. OP's salary literally doubled", "You dont work? How do you split things evenly then?", "Hahaha completely agree! While engaged we discussed what we would do once married. We still had completely separate finances then, because there was no legal contract protecting either of us in case of a break up.\n\nBest of luck with your marriage!!", "But she makes less than you. So she's being burdened.", "It\u2019s not fair for a 50/50 split if you make 1.4 times as much as her.", "Bali is expensive, we wanted to go there, it's not weird at all", "I wouldn't give my input whether I think it's necessary or not. If she wants a day at the spa despite having one day off at the spa two days ago I'll pay for it because she feels she needs it, it's not about that", "That's what abusive people do.", "So.... assuming in the US that extra $55k is taxed at 22% + 7.65%. \n\nSo you've got $39k going straight to your bank account more than she does every year.  Over $3k ***a month*** straight to the bank.  \n\nAnd you're wanting her to have no savings instead?  \n\nShe's paying equally for everything else.  Realistically she should be paying 40% for everything now while you pay 60%.  But you didn't, so she's already overpaying.  So why wouldn't you cover the vacation as compensation for her over paying on everything else?  \n\nAre you saying this vacation would cost $39k out of your pocket?", "Holy shit, talk about first world problems. You were gifted a house and make a combined 300k and you're bickering over a weekend trip?", "You've nearly doubled your income,  and as one poster says,  we estimate you're now saving nearly 40k a year.  But you insist that she have little or no savings,  and that before you pay for something fun for the two of you,  she should first sacrifice all the little comforts she pays for herself,  like having her hair done.  And the trip is 10k, so the 150 or so she save by not having her hair done is literally a drop in the bucket.   It's just kind of mean, in both senses of the word.", "Glad to see someone mention a normal healthy partnership on reddit u/LingonberryPrior6896 - was beginning to think it was just me that was odd.\n\nIt shouldn't make any difference who earns what, all the money that comes into our house is our money, not his or mine, ours. After the bills are paid we each spend whatever we want, we discuss any big purchases or holidays.\n\nCan't believe people actually live with this 50/50 set up, it seems to just breed resentment when one half of the partnership either falls short or earns more so kudos to those who manage to make it work.", "He bought his/your home, so he did buy something for himself. \n\nAnd, again, why should the household expenses not be split 50/50?", "Where does it say it doubled", "Context clues. \"Did\" refers to I DID. Past tense. I also said, \"nowadays\". I don't work now, but I did.\nAnd as for how I split things now that I don't work, I'm basically a housewife.", "Yep. She is essentially paying more for the wedding since there is more of a burden on her. Although, I think they need to have a big conversation on money. My husband & I keep our finances separate but we had a huge talk about finances and we don\u2019t argue over money.", "Dude you\u2019re so out of the loop it\u2019s insane\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Bali is famously cheap - you\u2019re rich and out of touch and didn\u2019t even consider trying to make it affordable so you think it\u2019s expensive when it\u2019s not.", "Okay yes, we understand your concept of money is flawed by having so much. What's your point?\nI also didn't say anything was weird about ithe situation?", "You HAVE given your input. I hope she realizes she will be a victim of financial abuse if she married you.", "I'm getting the feeling that you might actually have a good intention and sincerely don't understand. So I'm going to do my best to explain how I (and a lot of other women) would interpret this situation. You know your fiance best, so of course I might be wrong.\n\nI fully support myself since I graduated. I'm extremely lucky and grateful that my parents loaned me the money for a small apartment interest free and with small monthly payments.\n\nI haven't asked ANYONE for money since, with the exception of two times my parents loaned me a small sum I payed back within two months - again, I consider myself very lucky. \n\nI budget according to what I earn and what I want, if I don't have enough money for something non vital, I would go without. It's not in me to ask someone for it, and that includes my partner. \n\nI think you and your fiance skipped an important talk and you both made assumptions that have now exploded in your face. \n\nShe assumed you would pay, because in your shoes it's what she would have done (and otherwise she wouldn't have agreed on this trip right now), you assumed she would pay for half, because in her shoes you wouldn't mind having no savings and asking her for money for your personal extra expenses for a couple of months.\n\nHaving no savings is not an option for me. Makes me extremely uncomfortable and anxious.\n\nIf I were in her shoes and we were planning on having kids I would right now be extremely worried. Having kids significantly reduces not only your earnings that year, but causes you to miss promotions and future increases in pay (I know because it did for me), and that's assuming you have a healthy kid and a lot of support. In my case, with a healthy kid but not as much support I had to reduce my hours, and thus my salary (otherwise no one can pick her up from daycare some days)\n\nDo you see the point? I can explain it differently if some part is not clear.", "What do you think marriage is? \n\nI\u2019m not asking this to be rude.\n\nTo most people, marriage is about sharing your life with another person. That doesn\u2019t just mean parts of yourself and parts of your life. It\u2019s all of yourself and your life. Good times, bad times, stupid funny moments, stressful hard stuff. And money. \n\nIf you\u2019re going into marriage with a \u201cthis is mine\u201d or a \u201cthis isn\u2019t fair\u201d attitude then you\u2019re not going to have a successful marriage. Marriage is about putting someone else before yourself and figuring things out together. \n\nBased on everything you\u2019ve said here, I suggest you really reflect about what marriage means to you. Cause wanting things to be \u201cfair\u201d and keeping score is a surefire way to end up miserable and/or divorced.", "Financial abuser in its larval form. He\u2019s had everything handed to him very easily, but he can\u2019t bear the feeling he has that he\u2019s somehow losing out in the calculations he\u2019s making. All arbitrarily created in the comfort of his own brain. \n\nHe\u2019s happy to *gift* her things when she\u2019s out of money because it keeps him in control. And then he can use that control just like he describes on his op, to hang over her head and manipulate her. If I were her I\u2019d be running for the hills and immensely grateful his mask slipped before the wedding.", "Personally I think 50% of these people are trolls and many others are incels. My husband and I don't have the perfect marriage. I used to do all of the housework, child rearing and day to day mental load. \nHis job was demanding and for a while I let that happen. Then we had to negotiate and he needed to take some things off my plate (this was met with initial resistance- but he did listen). More negotiating after nest emptied, and as we both near retirement, we will have to look at how things are done again.", "Nope. I have been joint on all of our homes. 50/50 we would never have the home we have now.", "Well the last line made it confusing, where you said you still split everything down the middle (Present tense), so its confusing how you pay for half the expenses without working. Trust fund?", "So you're saying you don't split things evenly now due to a change of circumstances just like OPs job was a change of circumstances. Gotcha. I think you think you've made some point that you didn't.", "And that seems to work well for you guys. We put our money together. There's no \"yours or mine\". We just talk to eachother about purchases over a few hundred dollars as a check in rather than \"may I?\". Larger purchase we budget for. \n\nWe been through it all, one spouse not working, one making double what the other earns, earning the same. Swapped places a few times too. \n\nEvery couple is different, but if the disagreements start before marriage it's not going to end well. Finances are too important in a marriage to disagree on and usually a reason for divorce.\n\n You have to have the same mindset and general agreements on how finances are handled or like the OP says there will be feelings of \"unfairness\" and not being able to trust eachother.", "How is it a burden on her? Come on.. They are getting married and live together.. Their money becomes both of their money. This is a pointless ridiculous argument."]}
