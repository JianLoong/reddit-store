I told her she should pay with the money she saves each month for personal stuff since a trip is also something \"personal\" (not a necessity) then she got upset and said that splitting was stupid when we were about to get married. \n\n\nWe argued and she kept saying she won't cut money off her personal stuff expenses since she needs that.

You need to get in the same page financially immediately, otherwise don\u2019t bother getting married", "ESH.\n\nIt doesn't have to be all you paying, and it doesn't have to be her paying half when she makes so much less than you. In general, if a married/long-term couple doesn't merge their finances, it's recommended that they pay by percentage of income. This goes for all household expenses like a mortgage and utilities and groceries, and I think it's fair to use the same general rule for vacations. So, if you make $100,000 and she makes $50,000, then you should pay for 2/3 of the trip and she should pay for 1/3. So if the trip is $3,000, you're paying $2,000 in this scenario, and she's paying $1,000. You're paying based on income. FWIW, it should probably be the same split for the wedding. If you make twice as much as her, are you paying for 2/3 of the wedding costs?\n\nIf you don't have any major assets or major debts at this stage in your life (like one of you doesn't own a house already or something), then I'm a pretty big advocate for married couples merging finances and making financial decisions together, including making a budget. It takes away this idea of your money vs. her money. In my view, a marriage isn't just a romantic relationship but also like a business partnership. I view my husband as someone on my team, and we make financial decisions together because it's *our* money. So, compared to the scenario above, we wouldn't have to worry that he makes $100,000 a year and I make $50,000 and we need to split 2/3 and 1/3. Instead, it's just a \"We make $150,000/year\" attitude. It's merged.", "NAH but you need to figure your finances out immediately or this is going to be an issue forever. Combining or separating are both legitimate strategies - you just need to agree beforehand. \n\nIMO though...why get married at all if you're unwilling to combine finances? Not that money makes the marriage, but isn't it supposed to be all about literally sharing a life together? Why is money the one exception? At the very least, combining is a whole lot simpler than constantly calculating the correct ratios, stressing over who pays for what, etc.", "ESH!

She just spent her fun money on fun things and now expects you to bankroll the trip.\n\nIf you never discussed having joint finances, she doesn't get to pull that out of thin air when it benefits her. The fuck is her behavior?? No discussion, no openes about her finances. Just an emotional tantrum, bouncing and then threatening to call off the wedding. That is not how a grown-up communicates. That's a blackmail. Nothing got resolved with you just giving in. Either you go all in and join the finances, no matter who makes more at any point in your lives.

What she really meant was that she wants to share your money but keep hers to herself.  That\u2019s a huge marriage red flag to me and should be settled before the wedding.\n\nMy wife and I share all of our money equally.  We have one checking account, one savings account, one credit card, are both on the mortgage, etc.  We are both pretty responsible when it comes to money so it works.

Hopefully she'll get a new job in my company so she'll make more money soon and this won't be a problem anymore.", "I'll pay anyway, I already did but haven't told her yet, but I think it's unfair", "But he'd need to pay her back for all the expenses if they don't.", "Great point!", "I paid half the wedding too", "This, 100%.", "The \"small\" raise is that now he makes twice as much as before.", "No she has her own expenses. He made that clear. She's not spending his money on that, it's her money.\n\nShe spent her money on the wedding, he did not. What are you missing here? He's not pulling his financial weight.", "We already have a prenup", "This is why guys don't want to marry anymore.\n\n\" her money is hers, your money is her too!\" Okay...", "It's not very equitable if he makes a lot more but the cost of everything is split 50/50. What if the income disparity is extreme? What if a person makes $20,000/year but their partner makes $200,000/year? If a long term couple doesn't share finances, they are supposed to split based on percentage of income. In this case of extreme income disparity, the person making so much less would pay 10% of expenses, and the person making so much more would pay 90%.", "50/50 splitting only works if you only live within the lower income person\u2019s comfortable budget. The fair 50/50 solution here would be not to take the trip at all. \n\nEconomic and responsibility equity is a better way to go than a 50/50 split in most relationships, and certainly in most marriages. \n\nOP is in fact being the AH here. While it might be fair to ask his fianc\u00e9 to pay for meals, tips and entertainment on the trip up to a cutoff amount that would fit into her budget, without causing her to go into debt or go without personal care items she needs, he has instead decided it\u2019s fair to demand she go into a financial hardship to enjoy the trip with him. This is not how you treat a respected, valued and loved partner. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t treating him like a piggy bank, and what he\u2019s doing has everything to do with control and nothing to do with equity or equality.", "1. You don't know that. You cannot make decisions based upon some hypothetical situation that will never occur. It's a relationship not a game.\n\n2. She paid for \"wedding stuff\". He didn't. He can put his share in now.", "YTA. If you were sharing expenses equally because your income was similar, and then yours doubled, you should have changed the way expenses were split to allow her the same opportunity to save that you now have. She now makes 1/3 of the total income but has been responsible for 1/2 of the expenses for almost a year. She has been subsidizing your savings for 10 months at the cost of her own.", "YTA. Finances were the number one reason for divorce. Please do pre-marital counseling if you're going to get married. Also since you make double, you have more savings than her and is benefiting from the equal split, which is NOT equitable.", "If you earn double, pay for the trip.

Double is not a bit.", "Yikes. At least you'll likely have to pay all the legal costs for the divorce.", "My partner and I used to split 50:50, he now earns 50% more than I do, so he pays more into our joint expenses.

It can get really messy really quickly.", "If you think that\u2019s a solution, you shouldn\u2019t get married. When couples keep separate finances, you\u2019re supposed to keep an equitable, not equal split. The percentage of expenses covered is decided by each person\u2019s income, also allowing for x% of income to be put into savings for each person (vs either person being stretched so thin they cannot have savings); not 50/50.", "Huh? Even if she did get that job, what about 20 years from now? What if she has a kid? What if YOU lose your job and she doesn't?", "Why did you propose to her if you're clearly resistant to what marriage actually entails? What happens if she gets pregnant and can't work? What happens if you get laid off? What happens if she gets laid off? \n\nThis is why divorces are so common, so many people enter marriages they're only willing to make work if all circumstances remain the same.", "Due to the gender pay gap, you will likely not ever earn less than she does. This will always be a problem if it's a problem to you now.", "Someone else said it perfectly. When you got the raise, you were able to start saving more and she was not because you did not change how you split expenses. She\u2019s been subsidizing your savings and you\u2019re irritated with her for not being able to save more for vacation while she pays for your wedding. \n\nYou want to destress with her by stressing her out by dangling something you\u2019ve already paid for over her head?\n\nHow do you not see how screwed up that is?", "What if she doesn\u2019t? What if you have children and she takes maternity leave? Oops, guess she has no money! What a freeloader she is. /s", "Dude, if you think it's about \"fair\" you are NOT ready to be married. What type of games are you playing with her?", "You should NOT get married! You are not ready for marriage. You\u2019re missing the entire point here.

You guys have a lot to work out because there are bigger issues which require agreement and compromise. What happens if you buy a house?", "You did pay but you haven't told her yet so you can make her suffer in the meantime. When she finds out, in her shoes, I would decide not to go at all.\n\nI think you're expecting her to be all happy and grateful when she finds out you paid, but she's probably going yo be even more angry because you wasted all this time making sure she was as hurt and upset as possible so she will know she was wrong and you were right but you're being the bigger person.\n\nIck. YTA for sure", "YTA If you would rather go alone than pay for her, you have no business marrying her. She is spending her extras on things for YOUR wedding. You are going to be getting married and going to be a team. You making more money means the team has more money. You don\u2019t keep it for yourself & think you are the star player. You need couples counseling or you need to rethink what is fair. It\u2019s not fair your fianc\u00e9e is putting in her all her extra personal money & TIME into planning your wedding while you want to use your extra personal money to go on a trip without her.", "You do realise to continue splitting things 50/50 within your marriage you'll have to budget within her earnings. You can't go on an expensive trip and expect her to live like a monk for the next few months to pay you back. Do you even love this woman? You're about to spend the rest of your life with her and you're complaining about being 'her own personal piggy' bank over having to pay for one short trip and threatening to go without her.", "Do you want a wife and life partner or a savings account that only benefits you?", "Think of it this way. You're making more now, but maybe she'll make more in the future. So it all evens out. And if you are very confident that she'll never make as much as you, then it sounds like she should be the one complaining about fairness.", "Why do you think it's unfair OP??? Because she earns less and you earn more so why should the person earning more contribute more ????? \n\nHonestly, do you even love this woman? This is a distress trip right?? Would you rather she stresses out ??? \n\nSo essentially you want each one of you to live a life based on their income and not the joint income of the couple. I guess next time it'll be, you can't spare money to buy at this expensive restaurant so I'll go and you stay. \n\nMassive AH.", "Honestly you come off like a child. You don't have the mentality to be a husband. It's like you don't have any protector or provider qualities. You're like a brother battling with his sister.", "You\u2019re not ready to be married and share financial responsibility. Do yourself and her a favor by canceling the wedding.", "That makes you even more the jerk. YTA for giving her a hard time, manipulating her and making her feel guilty for something you have already paid for. Your true colours are showing and they are ugly AF", "So it's fair she paid for the wedding? Why aren't you helping pay for that?", "Holy shit. I hope she sees you for who you are before she legally ties herself to you. My god.", "Are you sure you\u2019ve paid half? I only ask because it\u2019s hard to get carried away with party planning.

The kind of things you don\u2019t really see but that make all the difference on the day", "After you pay for the trip (if you pay for both) will you still have savings? If she pays for herself, will she?\n\nIs there a reason why you didn't firstly work out whether or not you could both afford the trip before you even booked it?", "Good lord YTA", "The problem is that she's making an ultimatum: \"Pay for my vacation or we won't get married.\". If you give in to this ultimatum and pay for her vacation, then (1) you aren't going to enjoy yourself on it because of lingering resentment and (2) you'll have taught her that you'll roll over anytime she makes a threat.  So, you absolutely shouldn't take her on vacation.\n\nShe is literally saying that she isn't willing to make sacrifices for priorities and that you better give her what she wants or else.  Ever see a toddler screaming in a store and the Parent kinda walking away instead of buying the toy the kid is demanding?  It's the same thing here.  If you buy whatever your fiancee demands any time she throws a fit, she's going to throw fits constantly to get what she wants.\n\nEven with a prenup, you need counseling and to discuss handling of marital finances immediately.  If the wedding needs to be postponed while you work this issue out, then do that.", "Which guys? She earns less. It shouldn't be difficult.", "I know women and folks who are non-binary who also don't want to get get married due to the financial implications.  The reality is that marriage binds your finances together and that partners with disparate approaches to finances are going to struggle in a long term relationship.", "Absolutely, it's not equitable and in the comments, he mentioned he makes double what he used to. They used to make the same with her making a little more.

She just wouldn't have as much money for hair appointments and that kind of stuff if she would've paid. \n\nWe spoke together about the trip, when we were discussing about paying for it is when we had our argument.", "Yes the answer would be the same - it has nothing to do with gender.", "How did you parse who paid for what? Surely there was something that needed to be worked out.", "Okay but those \"hair appointments\" aren't unnecessary because women are judged on their attractiveness and you will judge her that way whether or not you think you will notice. So it's maintenance money. I really hate the way guys demand women be attractive, even ridicule women for not being attractive, then have the nerve to suggest that maintaining attractiveness is a frivolous expense. \n\nDid you pay for the trip before you discussed how you expected payment to work?\n\nIf you have savings left, personally I would see that as a non-issue and would not ask my partner to pay.\n\nIf this is really important to you, you need to have a proper discussion and if you do not reach an agreement, I would set you both free to find financially compatible partners. As I said, it's one of the main reasons for divorce and if it's an unresolved issue now, it will not go away.", "But this is after you already paid for it, so now you\u2019re just trying to be manipulative for reasons. \n\nSounds like you don\u2019t want to get married and are looking for a fight.", "For the house?
