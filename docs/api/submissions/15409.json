Gina also has a job, I'll try to get her into this new company I work with now since they pay more than what she's making now. Despite the raise on money, we haven't had any big changes regarding our lifestyle, so I've been able to save some extra money. We have planned the wedding too which was expensive, we both paid for most of it with our parents paying for some particular stuff as a gift. \n\nWe're used to split expenses since we earned about the same before and it made sense. However now we're planning a short trip to destress from work and she wants me to pay for everything since I have savings and she doesn't. She said she spent all her money on the wedding stuff and since we're a couple I shouldn't mind paying for her. I told her she should pay with the money she saves each month for personal stuff since a trip is also something \"personal\" (not a necessity) then she got upset and said that splitting was stupid when we were about to get married. \n\n\nWe argued and she kept saying she won't cut money off her personal stuff expenses since she needs that. She called me an asshole and greedy. I told her that I was not ok with being her piggybank and that if she can't pay for the trip then maybe she shouldn't go (I said this so she'll accept to pay herself) then she blew off at me because I'll rather go alone then pay for her. She got upset and left to her mom's house. She came back the day after but now she said I either pay for her to go, or leave alone and forget about the wedding. Am I really an asshole for thinking that we should split costs?\n\nEdit: I already paid for the trip, I haven't told her yet, I just want to know if I was an asshole for expecting her to pay too", "created_utc": 1682166795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v4m9n/aita_for_expecting_my_fiancee_to_pay_for_half_the/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Generally couples financially help each other out; if you're going to argue about 'fair' and threaten to go on holiday without her, you aren't ready to be married.", "ESH.

You need to get in the same page financially immediately, otherwise don\u2019t bother getting married", "ESH.\n\nIt doesn't have to be all you paying, and it doesn't have to be her paying half when she makes so much less than you. In general, if a married/long-term couple doesn't merge their finances, it's recommended that they pay by percentage of income. This goes for all household expenses like a mortgage and utilities and groceries, and I think it's fair to use the same general rule for vacations. So, if you make $100,000 and she makes $50,000, then you should pay for 2/3 of the trip and she should pay for 1/3. So if the trip is $3,000, you're paying $2,000 in this scenario, and she's paying $1,000. You're paying based on income. FWIW, it should probably be the same split for the wedding. If you make twice as much as her, are you paying for 2/3 of the wedding costs?\n\nIf you don't have any major assets or major debts at this stage in your life (like one of you doesn't own a house already or something), then I'm a pretty big advocate for married couples merging finances and making financial decisions together, including making a budget. It takes away this idea of your money vs. her money. In my view, a marriage isn't just a romantic relationship but also like a business partnership. I view my husband as someone on my team, and we make financial decisions together because it's *our* money. So, compared to the scenario above, we wouldn't have to worry that he makes $100,000 a year and I make $50,000 and we need to split 2/3 and 1/3. Instead, it's just a \"We make $150,000/year\" attitude. It's merged.", "NAH but you need to figure your finances out immediately or this is going to be an issue forever. Combining or separating are both legitimate strategies - you just need to agree beforehand. \n\nIMO though...why get married at all if you're unwilling to combine finances? Not that money makes the marriage, but isn't it supposed to be all about literally sharing a life together? Why is money the one exception? At the very least, combining is a whole lot simpler than constantly calculating the correct ratios, stressing over who pays for what, etc.", "ESH!

She just spent her fun money on fun things and now expects you to bankroll the trip.\n\nIf you never discussed having joint finances, she doesn't get to pull that out of thin air when it benefits her. The fuck is her behavior?? No discussion, no openes about her finances. Just an emotional tantrum, bouncing and then threatening to call off the wedding. That is not how a grown-up communicates. That's a blackmail. Nothing got resolved with you just giving in. Either you go all in and join the finances, no matter who makes more at any point in your lives. Or you do % according to your incomes for everything. So if you at this point make 20% more than her, you pay for 20% for the trip.", "NTA and here is the one small point that shows me why.

What she really meant was that she wants to share your money but keep hers to herself.  That\u2019s a huge marriage red flag to me and should be settled before the wedding.\n\nMy wife and I share all of our money equally.  We have one checking account, one savings account, one credit card, are both on the mortgage, etc.  We are both pretty responsible when it comes to money so it works.
