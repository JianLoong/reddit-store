My sons who are soon to be 29 and soon to be 26 both have Autism. I raised them as typical as I raised their sister who will be 28 this year. They knew the rules, how to behave in stores and restuarants and around others. My oldest is non-verbal but, functions mentally around 16 or so his younger brother talks enough for 20 people but is around 3-4 years old mentally. If I see him starting to act up I as his mother put a stop to it. Because, if I didn't.. I wouldn't be doing him any favors. I ask many parents of kids that have special needs what happens when you die and the kids don't have you to run interference?? Well, then the police or mental health judges get involved. Stop it! You aren't doing your kids any favors.", "NTA. A diagnosis is not an excuse for poor behavior. It's on them to learn strategies to deal with the world.", "NTA.  You were pissed off. You werent rude you just overshared more than what he's asking you. You didnt know he was gonna get into a panic attack.

Clearly he never was taught how to respect boundaries. I do however think you went to far and could have told him if he didn't stop you would report him.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. He was clearly using his autism to shield himself from consequences. There's no way he didn't understand you clearly telling him no; he just got away with it before and assumed he would again.

Even if you had been one of these things, he'd already had his second chance, and even a third chance, if these previous cases are anything to go by.

You are absolutely correct about the difference between an excuse and an explanation, especially if this was a repeated occurrence.", "Sounds like OP\u2019s complaint was the last straw for this coworker  tbh", "I definitely could see a kid with autism doing this, but a working adult should have made counter measures or worked past some problems, my sister with Autism could speak to anyone outside family till half why through middle school, and even then it was a slow process with one teacher getting her trust and expanding outwards, she hates crowds what does she do? Leave and enter school/class early,", "Idk, i mean i think many workplaces employ autistic people only because it would look good for their image or maybe theres a regulation somewhere but they are also less tolerant of them, and would look for an excuse to get rid of them. I cant tell with this one", "Anyone that pesters other employees to the tune of multiple complaints is risking their job.\n\nIf it was one incident, sure, but multiple strikes?", "This! I work in a grocery store, and we had one special needs girl who kept begging for change. She got caught stealing candy (her mother wouldn't allow her to have candy) and was fired. But, her mother was friends with one of the brothers of the store ownership family.  So, they *had* to rehire her after she got fired the first time. Then, I guess when she got caught stealing change from the registers, they finally were able to fire her for good. \n\nShe knew that theft was wrong. She just didn't care because she knew her mother wouldn't reprimand her.", "I have had lots of people down the years feel it was their right to know how my father died (if it cropped up in conversation that he had). I'd be confident the majority of them were not autistic, so I don't think we can assume this man's autism is a reason or excuse. I enjoy making them squirm with the details, hopefully it makes people think twice about being so damn nosy in future. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nLike I said in another thread, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. He asked. He did not respect your boundaries and suffered the consequences. \n\nAutism isn\u2019t an excuse to have people be nice to you and let you get away with stuff", "NTA- He pressed- this just ended badly still NTA", "NTA- he fucked around and found out", "NTA. At his age he should know how to respect people's boundaries.   You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  He persisted even after you plainly told him that you didn\u2019t want to talk about it.", "NTA so sorry you lost your dad under such tragic circumstances and that this idiot made you relive it.", "NTA", "NTA. Tired of autistic people on the internet being entitled people incapable of behaving normally.", "Don't ask questions if you don't want the answer.\n\nAfter multiple different work-leaving panic attacks, one should be able to identify a pattern of answers one does not want.\n\nHe's a melt, NTA.", "NTA. Your colleagues are trying to excuse the other guy's behaviour with his autism. As you said there is a difference between an excuse and an explanation. This is exactly what you get for prying.", "NTA.   \nAutism isn\u2019t an excuse to be an AH.", "General comment towards people who push for private info: its frustrating when they continuously push and have the nerve to get offended at answers and try to get YOU in trouble for it. \n\nNTA. He pushed, you told. People saying you are an asshole are using his autism as an excuse. And like you said, this wasn't the first instance. Coworker was basically harassing you for private information that he had absolutely no need to know.", "I have an autistic teenager and not pushing people for answers is something we work on a lot.  That said I feel like you could have just said no and reported him to hr so I'll go ESH.", "Seriously...he wanted to know, and now he *fucking* knows, and has hopefully learned a lesson about why you stop asking questions when people tell you to stop unless you *actually* want or need to know.", "Autism is absolutely something that causes one to accidentally pry and ask inappropriate questions. I think OP *might* be the AH *if* he did this intentionally to cause distress and he didn\u2019t tell the coworker clearly he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. But he did say that. Clearly, and directly, it seems, so NTA. (\u201cIt\u2019s sensitive\u201d is too vague in my view for the record. I would get it, but it\u2019s one of those neurotypical phrases I hate and makes no sense, and lots of folks would miss it. But \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u201d is clear.)\n\nBut autism can make folks seem to be prying quite accidentally. I\u2019ve accidentally asked the wrong question, even multiple times, and why on top, sincerely and totally accidentally with no sense until after that anyone was bothered, because no one told me directly to stop and people were upset I couldn\u2019t take a hint. People do need to understand that and be willing to be direct (I read social cues well enough to be pretty much effectively masked and still not well enough, many autistic folks struggle more than me). I\u2019m just saying that to emphasize the importance of direct communication, even when neurotypicals don\u2019t think they need to, to your statement, though. OP was direct, it seems, and got frustrated understandably.\n\nKind of a fucked up reason to fire the guy if this was the whole context though. But that\u2019s not on OP and maybe the guy did something worse prior? It doesn\u2019t sound like OP even filled a complaint or anything. The guy got overwhelmed and had to go home, even with prying questions, not usually a fireable offense, especially for someone who has a directly related disability.", "Not really, actively reporting is way further than simply \"Fine dude, here's your answer, happy?\" Besides, reporting an autistic person for social incompetence isn't likely to go very far.\n\nIf this were a deliberate move to upset him, fair, but it wasn't even an attempt to fuck with the guy, he's just a massive wet wipe. Looks like everything worked out perfectly, he lifted up an unassuming rock and found bugs. He screamed and ran away. The very epitome of a self-solving problem.", "As an adult on the spectrum, 0 support level, I agree. My parents did NOT treat me differently or let me use differences as an excuse to behave badly. My dad told me \"You had better learn to get along in the world because it won't change just for you. You're smart and capable, so act like it!\"", "The kid didn't take no for an answer.  Also, I'm curious reporting them to HR is better how and for who?", "OP did say no; \"I don't want to talk about it\" is a firm no.\n\nThe coworker did not care; what followed is on them.", "Very true but there are some people who just are unable to leave something alone then they have to suffer the consequences of knowing.  YANTA \nI knew female decades ago she was inquisitive beyond any normal nosiness.  Well it turned out her uncle was her dad and her mom was her 14 year older sister\u2026. Let\u2019s just say she didn\u2019t handle it well.  \nShe had bothered an aunt? Bout it for so long the aunt told her the story.    When she bitched to her aunt bout she was hurt to learn the info.   Supposedly the aunt yelled at \u201cyou\u2019re the stupid idiot who will not stop poking after your told no or leave it alone.  ( yes the woman in the story is def a bit odd but not on any spectrum (to my knowledge)", "But OP stated several times that they did not want to talk about it. It\u2019s one thing to be accidentally too prying, but OP set a clear boundary.", "OP states that he articulated, **repeatedly**, that he did not want to talk about it and that it was sensitive. \n\nNeurotypical or not, that\u2019s a pretty damn explicit indicator to stop asking.", ">I think OP might be the AH if he did this intentionally to cause distress\n\nI\u2019m neurodivergent but 100% disagree with this part of your take. If someone clearly tells you (universal you) to back off and you keep going, then regardless of the reason why you pushed, you\u2019re TA and the other person has no obligation to play nice or cater to your sensitivities.", "It\u2019s not the company\u2019s fault the autistic guy harassed OP and then had a freak-out from the answer. And it sounds like he did it to other people based on the complaints."]}
