He was out of line and apparently fucked up a few other times so I don't think him being let go is on you. He was let go for causing problems and being an legal risk.", "NTA and I'm tired of people treating people aren't typical Autism, Adhd and whatever else you wanna tack on there as if they shouldn't be held accountable  to the fullest of their ability to their bad behaviors. My sons who are soon to be 29 and soon to be 26 both have Autism. I raised them as typical as I raised their sister who will be 28 this year. They knew the rules, how to behave in stores and restuarants and around others. My oldest is non-verbal but, functions mentally around 16 or so his younger brother talks enough for 20 people but is around 3-4 years old mentally. If I see him starting to act up I as his mother put a stop to it. Because, if I didn't.. I wouldn't be doing him any favors. I ask many parents of kids that have special needs what happens when you die and the kids don't have you to run interference?? Well, then the police or mental health judges get involved. Stop it! You aren't doing your kids any favors.", "NTA. A diagnosis is not an excuse for poor behavior. It's on them to learn strategies to deal with the world.", "NTA.  You were pissed off. You werent rude you just overshared more than what he's asking you. You didnt know he was gonna get into a panic attack. I'm sure co workers had also done some things insensitive to your autistic co-worker. I know I probably would have, not because I intend to but because I just dont know how to treat them best.\n\nNot your fault your boss decided to use that as an excuse to fire him.", "NTA im autistic and autisim is not an excuse for not taking no for an answer. Clearly he never was taught how to respect boundaries. I do however think you went to far and could have told him if he didn't stop you would report him.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. He was clearly using his autism to shield himself from consequences. There's no way he didn't understand you clearly telling him no; he just got away with it before and assumed he would again. He fully deserved to be both panicked and fired. Hopefully it teaches him a lesson in respecting boundaries", "NTA. You're not the one who fired him. You're not even the one who reported him. Even if you had been one of these things, he'd already had his second chance, and even a third chance, if these previous cases are anything to go by. Autistic people are perfectly capable of learning why harassment is wrong: he crossed the line from autistic behavior to asshole behavior several second chances ago.", "Nta: just because you\u2019re autistic or have some underlying problem doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to be an AH. You did nothing wrong, just gave him the answer that he apparently just couldn\u2019t live without.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are absolutely correct about the difference between an excuse and an explanation, especially if this was a repeated occurrence.", "Sounds like OP\u2019s complaint was the last straw for this coworker  tbh", "I definitely could see a kid with autism doing this, but a working adult should have made counter measures or worked past some problems, my sister with Autism could speak to anyone outside family till half why through middle school, and even then it was a slow process with one teacher getting her trust and expanding outwards, she hates crowds what does she do? Leave and enter school/class early,", "Idk, i mean i think many workplaces employ autistic people only because it would look good for their image or maybe theres a regulation somewhere but they are also less tolerant of them, and would look for an excuse to get rid of them. I cant tell with this one", "Anyone that pesters other employees to the tune of multiple complaints is risking their job.\n\nIf it was one incident, sure, but multiple strikes?", "This! I work in a grocery store, and we had one special needs girl who kept begging for change. She got caught stealing candy (her mother wouldn't allow her to have candy) and was fired. But, her mother was friends with one of the brothers of the store ownership family.  So, they *had* to rehire her after she got fired the first time. Then, I guess when she got caught stealing change from the registers, they finally were able to fire her for good. \n\nShe knew that theft was wrong. She just didn't care because she knew her mother wouldn't reprimand her."]}
