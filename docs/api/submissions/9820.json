Leave and enter school/class early,", "Idk, i mean i think many workplaces employ autistic people only because it would look good for their image or maybe theres a regulation somewhere but they are also less tolerant of them, and would look for an excuse to get rid of them.

I work in a grocery store, and we had one special needs girl who kept begging for change. She got caught stealing candy (her mother wouldn't allow her to have candy) and was fired. But, her mother was friends with one of the brothers of the store ownership family.  So, they *had* to rehire her after she got fired the first time. Then, I guess when she got caught stealing change from the registers, they finally were able to fire her for good. \n\nShe knew that theft was wrong. She just didn't care because she knew her mother wouldn't reprimand her.", "I have had lots of people down the years feel it was their right to know how my father died (if it cropped up in conversation that he had). I'd be confident the majority of them were not autistic, so I don't think we can assume this man's autism is a reason or excuse. I enjoy making them squirm with the details, hopefully it makes people think twice about being so damn nosy in future.

Coworker was basically harassing you for private information that he had absolutely no need to know.", "I have an autistic teenager and not pushing people for answers is something we work on a lot.  That said I feel like you could have just said no and reported him to hr so I'll go ESH.", "Seriously...he wanted to know, and now he *fucking* knows, and has hopefully learned a lesson about why you stop asking questions when people tell you to stop unless you *actually* want or need to know.", "Autism is absolutely something that causes one to accidentally pry and ask inappropriate questions. I think OP *might* be the AH *if* he did this intentionally to cause distress and he didn\u2019t tell the coworker clearly he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. But he did say that. Clearly, and directly, it seems, so NTA. (\u201cIt\u2019s sensitive\u201d is too vague in my view for the record. I would get it, but it\u2019s one of those neurotypical phrases I hate and makes no sense, and lots of folks would miss it. But \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u201d is clear.)\n\nBut autism can make folks seem to be prying quite accidentally. I\u2019ve accidentally asked the wrong question, even multiple times, and why on top, sincerely and totally accidentally with no sense until after that anyone was bothered, because no one told me directly to stop and people were upset I couldn\u2019t take a hint. People do need to understand that and be willing to be direct (I read social cues well enough to be pretty much effectively masked and still not well enough, many autistic folks struggle more than me). I\u2019m just saying that to emphasize the importance of direct communication, even when neurotypicals don\u2019t think they need to, to your statement, though. OP was direct, it seems, and got frustrated understandably.\n\nKind of a fucked up reason to fire the guy if this was the whole context though. But that\u2019s not on OP and maybe the guy did something worse prior? It doesn\u2019t sound like OP even filled a complaint or anything. The guy got overwhelmed and had to go home, even with prying questions, not usually a fireable offense, especially for someone who has a directly related disability.", "Not really, actively reporting is way further than simply \"Fine dude, here's your answer, happy?\" Besides, reporting an autistic person for social incompetence isn't likely to go very far.\n\nIf this were a deliberate move to upset him, fair, but it wasn't even an attempt to fuck with the guy, he's just a massive wet wipe. Looks like everything worked out perfectly, he lifted up an unassuming rock and found bugs. He screamed and ran away. The very epitome of a self-solving problem.", "As an adult on the spectrum, 0 support level, I agree. My parents did NOT treat me differently or let me use differences as an excuse to behave badly. My dad told me \"You had better learn to get along in the world because it won't change just for you. You're smart and capable, so act like it!\"", "The kid didn't take no for an answer.  Also, I'm curious reporting them to HR is better how and for who?", "OP did say no; \"I don't want to talk about it\" is a firm no.\n\nThe coworker did not care; what followed is on them.", "Very true but there are some people who just are unable to leave something alone then they have to suffer the consequences of knowing.  YANTA \nI knew female decades ago she was inquisitive beyond any normal nosiness.  Well it turned out her uncle was her dad and her mom was her 14 year older sister\u2026. Let\u2019s just say she didn\u2019t handle it well.  \nShe had bothered an aunt? Bout it for so long the aunt told her the story.    When she bitched to her aunt bout she was hurt to learn the info.   Supposedly the aunt yelled at \u201cyou\u2019re the stupid idiot who will not stop poking after your told no or leave it alone.

And it sounds like he did it to other people based on the complaints.", "NTA\n\nAutism doesn't make you take no for an answer.  It could make the person not recognize your apprehension if it wasn't verbalized clear but, of course, the word no is simple enough for anyone to understand.", "NTA, he kept pestering you and you answered despite you telling him several times to basically drop the subject. He did it to himself unfortunately and this is one of those situations where the saying \u201cmind the business that pays you\u201d fits perfectly.", "Mental illness is not an excuse, coming from someone with illness.

You did NOTHING wrong !", "NTA Autistic people sometimes can struggle with social cues, that's not the same as just ignoring when someone says they're uncomfortable.", "NTA\nYou told him no, he kept prying, if he didn't like the answer he got that's all on him.", "Autistic here - NTA. Just because one is autistic doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t understand boundaries, especially when people clearly say \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about X\u201d.

Statements like that are not subtle or hard to interpret. \n\nAutism isn\u2019t an excuse to be an insensitive jerk. As with any disorder, autism isn\u2019t his fault but it is his responsibility. That guy had a history. Hopefully he learns from being fired and actually examines himself.

I've had two autistic friends I had to cut out (after giving warnings) for either super rude or incredibly invasive behaviour. But have family members on the spectrum and they are perfectly fine. I understand the spectrum part, but when you see someone acting one way with you and one way with others it's hard to believe it's not a choice. Also, not autistic but I do have adhd and while it gives challenges, it gives you powers as well. I think it's important to see both and you sound like a wonderful parent!", "Dude. 'No' is a complete sentance.

It sucks but if you are capable of holding a job then you\u2019re capable of understanding what \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u201d means. As you said, OP was very direct more than once. If they are incapable if knowing what no means, there\u2019s people out there that\u2019s paid to be by your side every second you\u2019re working. In my area they are usually called Life Coaches.

She raised him to never do half the crap I read people do on here daily and think they should get away with. I raised my kids knowing 1 day I'm not gonna be here anymore to protect them. By not having rules, goals and consequences  it's setting a bunch of people up to fail. Life is NOT fair. I didn't hand out participation  trophies yet all 3 of my kids graduated from high school and are happy and healthy * as they can be* my daughter is a surgical  nurse and knows I love her and did my best.
