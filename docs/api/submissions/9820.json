Are there just a bunch of trolls with a vendetta against people with ASD or something?? Because while people with autism are in fact people and can absolutely be AHs, statistically this baffles me. In the last day alone, there were roughly *five* *posts* about people being excused/excusing themselves for bad behavior specifically because of their diagnosis, and roughly *nine* *total* that involved people with ASD.\n\nContrast that with, say, ADHD, where the lowest statistic I could find put the percentage at 2.2% (others were 4.4% and up to 9.8%) so at least double and potentially a much higher number of people. And yet there is a also a grand total of only about *five* posts in the last day that I could find centering that, and three of them, MORE THAN HALF, mention the person with ADHD also having ASD!\n\nAnd ADHD can also often be a cause for interpersonal conflicts (e.g from impulsiveness, unable to listen, forgetfulness/executive function issues), just like ASD can cause interpersonal conflicts - and people with ASD do in fact have empathy and good chunk of us absolutely have the ability to follow social rules/direct requests once they're provided if we haven't figured them out logically by ourselves first (also I can provide statistics/references on all info in this post this if people can't do the basic google searches). That isn't even touching on statistics for AITA conflicts involving other disabilities/neurodivergences. So is there something I'm missing? Are people who know people with officially diagnosed ASD just somehow coincidentally congregating en mass to AITA?
