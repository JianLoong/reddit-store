I think it's kinda creepy that 3 men in their 20s are okay with sharing a room with a 12-year-old girl, even if you are their sister.\nSurely they must be uncomfortable with the situation as well so maybe talk to them and all approach your father together. Convince him that a divider is best for everybody and it'll be harder for him to say no.\n\nAs for the bathroom, a small bolt that's flimsy enough to be broken in an emergency should be easy enough to find. That way you get privacy when showering and dad knows that if something were to happen then he or one of your brothers can still get in. \n\nHope you're able to come to some sort of arrangement but rest assured that you are NTA.", "NTA but you and 6 grown men are sharing a 2 bedroom place? That\u2019s not right. Your father should be providing properly for you!", "What in the world did I just read? NTA! It doesn't matter what genders are involved - every child deserves privacy when they're getting changed or even just sitting there on their own bed reading. \n\nThis is very short-sighted of your dad. Do you have a female relative in his age group who can talk to him? She wouldn't even have to say \"OP told me you're being short-sighted and tone-deaf, you plonker\". All she'd have to say is, \"Wow, I have no idea how OP is coping for privacy in your house right now. I bet you have some screened-off part of the room for her, right? Right??\" \n\nIf you don't have a relative that age who you can go to, think of family friends. Your dad will be more likely to listen to them rather than his own child. You are NOT being selfish.", "NTA. A divider is as simple as constructing a light curtain to fall over your bed space to allow changing and privacy. And most homes have locks on the bathroom door, without emergency incident.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm not sure how these chores can possibly be fair. You are a 12 year old cooking for yourself and 6 grown men? And doing the laundry of yourself and 6 grown men?\n\nThose are like the two hardest and most time consuming chores.\n\nBetween the 6 adults they manage to what, take the bins out and hoover? Wipe down counter tops? Wash the dishes? Between 6 of them?\n\nYou're probably spending more time each day doing chores than they spend each week.\n\nThen on top of that you can't lock the bathroom door or have a room divider.\n\nYou are not selfish at all, and you are the one being treated unfairly here. And if its not due to the fact you're a girl I'll eat my hat.", "NTA, and I\u2019m really curious to know why your brothers (who are all old enough to get a job and move out) are okay with that living situation, too. I\u2019m sure they want some privacy, too. Sounds like it might be time for some of them to start moving out.", "Nta, it's entirely reasonable to want privacy and your own space, especially at your age", "The divider could be a curtain, suspended from the ceiling.that shouldn't be too intrusive. As for the bathroom, has there been an issue with people walking in? A closed door should mean stay out.", "NTA. You are coming to the age now where you will need your privacy. And I don't know where you live but in many places, it is illegal for a female child to share a room with their male siblings. Especially considering your brothers are adults.  You are the only girl and your dad may not be considering the differences between you and your brothers. But this is not OK.", "Absolutely NTA but why are your adult brothers living with you and your father in a two bedroom apartment? That is not normal.", "NTA. Does CPS need to make a visit? Because that doesn\u2019t seem conducive to a healthy environment at all. Also, there are doorknobs with locks that allow for emergency access with a small cylindrical key with a flat end. That\u2019s a more than reasonable option for the bathroom situation.", "Aww man, this must be so hard for all of you, firstly your dad has done so well and he needs to know that but at your age you need your space from the boys - you know in the UK in certain predicaments different gendered siblings of a certain age are not allowed to share bedrooms \n\nFirstly the lock on the door, you have a twisty lock installed, the type that you could open with a knife from the other side (or even a coin, as my child likes to do) that way you have the privacy and they can have access if there\u2019s an emergency \n\nSecondly, you really do need a curtain, this isn\u2019t about being selfish, you are going through puberty and you need privacy, you aren\u2019t sharing a room with other people in the same boat, they\u2019re fully grown adults and to call you selfish is really unfair (I understand why he\u2019s defensive but it\u2019s not the time or the place for him to be so) you\u2019re a young woman, I am sure he is doing a super job but neither he or your brothers can understand your need for some space, I think a partition of some sort of a wonderful idea.\n\nMaybe use this post to show him, with some outsiders perspectives - if you see this Dad, you\u2019re smashing it with them kids but give the girl a curtain man!\n\nEdit to add: NTA", "Are your brothers contributing toward expenses? With multiple people contributing a four bedroom should be doable unless you\u2019re in California. Even nyc has four bedrooms under 5k a month. You need your own room.", "NTA\n\n I'm not sure where you live, but every house I've ever been in has a lock on the bathroom door. \n\nA young girl has a right to privacy in a house full of boys. Your dad just might not want to acknowledge that you're growing up, but he's going to have to eventually. His attitude might change once you get a bit older and start fully going through puberty.", "NTA I understand you completely. Unfortunately there's no space in your house to have the privacy you need, but your solution is great. I suggest to talk about the divider in your room with your brothers too, so you can explain what you need and ask if it'll be okay for them. If you siblings agree, your father will agree too. About the locker, I understand your father point of view too, but you could compromise with a sign to put outside the door, so you guys see when the bathroom is being used.", "NTA. But the situation is that your dad does not have the money to put in room dividers, and if it's an apartment he probably cannot do so anyway.\n\nI very much hope his adult sons at the very, very least have jobs and are paying rent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No worries, what your thinking and feeling is 100% normal. And you might be able to quietly resolve this yourself. Bathroom privacy is a huge thing, and the easiest solution is a door wedge or door stop. It's a little triangle of wood or rubber shaped like this \ud83d\udea9, and you shove the skinny tip under the door wherever you want it to stay.... In your case, close it all the way and then jam it under the door. Someone might be a able to crank the door a bit, but won't be able to open it very far. (Pro tip! When you get older, always have one when you travel or visit people.... Chain or bolt locks can be flimsy, Better safe than sorry)\n\nAs for privacy, you can use cheap king sized flat sheets to curtain off your bed. They can be held in place with simple thumb tacks. Save up your pocket money or ask to do extra chores for cash, if not your family maybe neighbors? Like running errands or babysitting?\n\nNow for your dad. He needs a 'come to Jesus' moment, and at 12, you're going to have to get him there. This is a tough convo but here's what you need to do. You need to ask your dad to a a private talk with him, ALONE. You need to tell him that you are becoming a young lady and you need your privacy. That the your brothers *the  young men that you share your bedroom with* also need their privacy. That you are a girl child in a house full of grown men and deserve to feel safe and relaxed in your own home, and not have to feel afraid of a young man seeing you naked.

But calling him a garbage parent simply because he can\u2019t see her POV on account of having raised 5 boys before OP+ being overworked, is just extreme.

But as it is saying there is no issue with the share of chores on the 12 year olds shoulders is ludicrous. 6 adults and only one of them would need to wash up after cooking more than one day a week.\n\nAnd all of that is relevant because it makes OP even less of the A because she is doing way more than her fair share of chores, yet her dad won't let her have privacy and called her *selfish*.", "Not about empathy but a decent parent would try and see the perspective and point of view of all his children. He has a daughter and it doesn\u2019t seem that he is considering her feelings at all. So yes not considering your child\u2019s feelings does make you a garbage parent.

If her family tells her that's fine, and people like you tell her that's fine rather than take the tiny flick to your pride that it would be to admit you hadn't considered the chore allocation when you first commented about how well her dad was doing, she will believe that it is fine. It is not fine. She is doing way more than her fair share despite being the only child in the flat. It is not fine.\n\nAnyone who has ever been responsible for a household, even if they were living alone, knows doing the cooking and the laundry are the chores that take the longest, and cooking is the one that takes the most effort.\n\nThe only way that's not true is if someone lives in a giant house that takes ages to hoover. But this is a two bed one bath flat, so no.\n\nIf you want to continue reinforcing that the only child and only girl should spending more time and effort doing chores than the 6 adult men she lives with, go right ahead.

You sound like quite a grown up 12 yo so just know this, boys are stupid when it comes to what women actually need and want, you want privacy but I would say you actually need it.  Your brothers are all young but even sitting them down and explaining that their younger sister needs privacy now and then for 'womens' things would probably surprise you.\n\nGood luck.", "Abso-freaking-lutely NTA , OP! For a couple reasons.\n\nOkay, first of all : you\u2019re a YOUNG GIRL living with SIX GROWN MEN, sharing a bedroom with three of them. You should have your own space, regardless of their feelings on it. In no way is this okay. Giving you the divider you asked for is the least your dad can do. Is there like a basement? Or a dining room separate from the kitchen that can be converted into a bedroom for you? I know in some places a young girl sharing a room with grown men could potentially be against the Child Protection Laws, unless there\u2019s a way that gives you privacy. Even just hanging a curtain(s) in a small area (like close to and around your bed, maybe? At least, I hope you have your own bed, OP).\n\nSecond : the bathroom door lock thing? ALL locks can be gotten into; it\u2019s just a matter of figuring out what works. Sometimes it\u2019s a card that works or a flathead screwdriver. You can also buy locks that come with a key that can be used to unlock from the outside. Not to mention, it\u2019s always a good thing to have a place to run to and lock yourself in in case of like an intruder.\n\nThird : is there not a common area like a living room your brothers and their friends could hang out when you want to go to bed? They\u2019re adults and you\u2019re not; you shouldn\u2019t be the one compromising your comfort for them. \n\nFourth : your brothers should at least be contributing to the household and work. Instead of them complaining about lack of space, they should DO something about it. Maybe a couple of them move out into a place together. Regardless of them being in college/university/trade school. They should be paying their own ways at this point in life. \n\nLastly : you\u2019re the child in this situation - you should not be mothering grown adults! Cooking and doing laundry for that many grown adults is hard for even an actual adult to do. I should know - I help my mother with laundry for the house (myself, my mom, dad, and my two older brothers) and it\u2019s Hard even as an adult. I swear, one of them uses more clothes than me and my mom combined! We also do most of the cooking unless it\u2019s on the barbecue or we\u2019re eating outI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t do something you enjoy (like cooking), but you also deserve to actually be a child. And 12 is way too young to start those particular \u201cchores\u201d, let alone having been doing them for a while. What does your dad and brothers do around the house? \n\nBut firmly NTA on your part, OP! Your dad and brothers are A  Holes though, in my opinion", "NTA.
