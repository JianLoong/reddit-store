We all have our own chores to do (i do all the cooking because I like cooking, and also do the laundry) and most ofthe time it's all good and we get along.\n\nWe live in a small apartment with only two bedrooms, so my dad is sharing a room with two of my brothers and I'm sharing a room with three of my brothers. I was always okay with it but now I kind of want more privacy. i feel like I can't be in my room or go to sleep because i can't change into my pyjamas and sleep when there are other people in the room. sometimes my brothers have friends over so it is even more difficult. It wasnt a problem before but I think because i'm getting older I'm becoming a more private person. when showering too, I get really insecure and anxious when i'm showering because theres no lock on the door so i am really afraid of someone coming in while i'm in the shower.\n\nSo I asked my dad if he can put a lock on the bathroom door and if I can put a divider in my room so i have more privacy and not have to worry about someone seeing me when i'm getting dressed. my dad said it wasn't okay because being able to lock the door from the inside is dangerous and if something happened nobody would be able to come in to help, and putting a divider in my room is unfair to my brothers because im taking space away from them because it is also their room. i tried to convince him but he told me to stop being selfish and that we're family so i shouldn't make a big problem out of not having privacy. \n\nNow I wonder if i am being selfish for asking for my own space?", "created_utc": 1687854500, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k7qy8/aita_for_asking_to_put_a_divider_in_my_room_and_a/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it's kinda creepy that 3 men in their 20s are okay with sharing a room with a 12-year-old girl, even if you are their sister.\nSurely they must be uncomfortable with the situation as well so maybe talk to them and all approach your father together. Convince him that a divider is best for everybody and it'll be harder for him to say no.\n\nAs for the bathroom, a small bolt that's flimsy enough to be broken in an emergency should be easy enough to find. That way you get privacy when showering and dad knows that if something were to happen then he or one of your brothers can still get in. \n\nHope you're able to come to some sort of arrangement but rest assured that you are NTA.", "NTA but you and 6 grown men are sharing a 2 bedroom place? That\u2019s not right. Your father should be providing properly for you!", "What in the world did I just read? NTA! It doesn't matter what genders are involved - every child deserves privacy when they're getting changed or even just sitting there on their own bed reading. \n\nThis is very short-sighted of your dad. Do you have a female relative in his age group who can talk to him? She wouldn't even have to say \"OP told me you're being short-sighted and tone-deaf, you plonker\". All she'd have to say is, \"Wow, I have no idea how OP is coping for privacy in your house right now. I bet you have some screened-off part of the room for her, right? Right??\" \n\nIf you don't have a relative that age who you can go to, think of family friends. Your dad will be more likely to listen to them rather than his own child. You are NOT being selfish.", "NTA. A divider is as simple as constructing a light curtain to fall over your bed space to allow changing and privacy. And most homes have locks on the bathroom door, without emergency incident.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm not sure how these chores can possibly be fair. You are a 12 year old cooking for yourself and 6 grown men? And doing the laundry of yourself and 6 grown men?\n\nThose are like the two hardest and most time consuming chores.\n\nBetween the 6 adults they manage to what, take the bins out and hoover? Wipe down counter tops? Wash the dishes? Between 6 of them?\n\nYou're probably spending more time each day doing chores than they spend each week.\n\nThen on top of that you can't lock the bathroom door or have a room divider.\n\nYou are not selfish at all, and you are the one being treated unfairly here. And if its not due to the fact you're a girl I'll eat my hat.", "NTA, and I\u2019m really curious to know why your brothers (who are all old enough to get a job and move out) are okay with that living situation, too. I\u2019m sure they want some privacy, too. Sounds like it might be time for some of them to start moving out.", "Nta, it's entirely reasonable to want privacy and your own space, especially at your age", "The divider could be a curtain, suspended from the ceiling.that shouldn't be too intrusive. As for the bathroom, has there been an issue with people walking in? A closed door should mean stay out.", "NTA. You are coming to the age now where you will need your privacy. And I don't know where you live but in many places, it is illegal for a female child to share a room with their male siblings. Especially considering your brothers are adults.  You are the only girl and your dad may not be considering the differences between you and your brothers. But this is not OK.", "Absolutely NTA but why are your adult brothers living with you and your father in a two bedroom apartment? That is not normal.", "NTA. Does CPS need to make a visit? Because that doesn\u2019t seem conducive to a healthy environment at all. Also, there are doorknobs with locks that allow for emergency access with a small cylindrical key with a flat end. That\u2019s a more than reasonable option for the bathroom situation.", "Aww man, this must be so hard for all of you, firstly your dad has done so well and he needs to know that but at your age you need your space from the boys - you know in the UK in certain predicaments different gendered siblings of a certain age are not allowed to share bedrooms \n\nFirstly the lock on the door, you have a twisty lock installed, the type that you could open with a knife from the other side (or even a coin, as my child likes to do) that way you have the privacy and they can have access if there\u2019s an emergency \n\nSecondly, you really do need a curtain, this isn\u2019t about being selfish, you are going through puberty and you need privacy, you aren\u2019t sharing a room with other people in the same boat, they\u2019re fully grown adults and to call you selfish is really unfair (I understand why he\u2019s defensive but it\u2019s not the time or the place for him to be so) you\u2019re a young woman, I am sure he is doing a super job but neither he or your brothers can understand your need for some space, I think a partition of some sort of a wonderful idea.\n\nMaybe use this post to show him, with some outsiders perspectives - if you see this Dad, you\u2019re smashing it with them kids but give the girl a curtain man!\n\nEdit to add: NTA", "Are your brothers contributing toward expenses? With multiple people contributing a four bedroom should be doable unless you\u2019re in California. Even nyc has four bedrooms under 5k a month. You need your own room.", "NTA\n\n I'm not sure where you live, but every house I've ever been in has a lock on the bathroom door. \n\nA young girl has a right to privacy in a house full of boys. Your dad just might not want to acknowledge that you're growing up, but he's going to have to eventually. His attitude might change once you get a bit older and start fully going through puberty.", "NTA I understand you completely. Unfortunately there's no space in your house to have the privacy you need, but your solution is great. I suggest to talk about the divider in your room with your brothers too, so you can explain what you need and ask if it'll be okay for them. If you siblings agree, your father will agree too. About the locker, I understand your father point of view too, but you could compromise with a sign to put outside the door, so you guys see when the bathroom is being used.", "NTA. But the situation is that your dad does not have the money to put in room dividers, and if it's an apartment he probably cannot do so anyway.\n\nI very much hope his adult sons at the very, very least have jobs and are paying rent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No worries, what your thinking and feeling is 100% normal. And you might be able to quietly resolve this yourself. Bathroom privacy is a huge thing, and the easiest solution is a door wedge or door stop. It's a little triangle of wood or rubber shaped like this \ud83d\udea9, and you shove the skinny tip under the door wherever you want it to stay.... In your case, close it all the way and then jam it under the door. Someone might be a able to crank the door a bit, but won't be able to open it very far. (Pro tip! When you get older, always have one when you travel or visit people.... Chain or bolt locks can be flimsy, Better safe than sorry)\n\nAs for privacy, you can use cheap king sized flat sheets to curtain off your bed. They can be held in place with simple thumb tacks. Save up your pocket money or ask to do extra chores for cash, if not your family maybe neighbors? Like running errands or babysitting?\n\nNow for your dad. He needs a 'come to Jesus' moment, and at 12, you're going to have to get him there. This is a tough convo but here's what you need to do. You need to ask your dad to a a private talk with him, ALONE. You need to tell him that you are becoming a young lady and you need your privacy. That the your brothers *the  young men that you share your bedroom with* also need their privacy. That you are a girl child in a house full of grown men and deserve to feel safe and relaxed in your own home, and not have to feel afraid of a young man seeing you naked. A curtain divider takes no space away from your brothers, they don't use the air above your bed. \n\nI really feel for you sweetie, and hate that you're going thru this. I know your mom would handle this for you if she were there. I don't know if you have a trusted teacher or advocate at your school that could her you...

He won\u2019t even try and make accommodations to make you feel comfortable you should report him.", "Do you live in a big city or something?

Between 6 adult men.

You slating his parenting is not helping the situation at all, us being judgemental about something that was not asked is completely unfair to her and him - would it be a situation I\u2019d have if I was in that dynamic, probably not no, but that man still deserves acknowledgment for raising all those kids, all by himself, in probably one of the hardest times of his life, not to be accused of being a shitty parent because the chores that are divided up aren\u2019t what you agree with - for all we know she may hate the tidying, hoovering etc. which is why she chooses to cook and do laundry. I know if I could pick between stuff they would be my favourites to do out of everything", "Dude. It\u2019s one story, one incident. Are you seriously going to call him a garbage parent without getting any idea at all about their day to day interactions?! Are you serious? Did your parents never say no to you?! So what, do you think your parents are garbage as well for that?! Did you report your parents as well for it?\n\nOP is NTA and once again, the father is at fault here. But calling him a garbage parent simply because he can\u2019t see her POV on account of having raised 5 boys before OP+ being overworked, is just extreme. You need to calm down.\n\n\nYou are commenting under a post that a young, impressionable 12 year old has written about her father who\u2019s A SINGLE PARENT TO 6 KIDS, and these are the words you choose to describe her parent?\n\nI\u2019m glad that you were such a good single parent back when you raised 6 children under your roof, but not everybody is born with that knowledge. Learn to have some damn empathy.", "> All of the chores will be time consuming when it\u2019s that many people in one space, the tidying and cleaning after cooking takes just as long as the cooking. \n\nYou are just doubling down out of defensiveness now.\n\nAny scale up of how long each chore takes also applies to OPs chores so that cancels out.\n\nSo again, they are all daily chores yet OP probably spends more time doing chores each day than they do each week.\n\nIf it was one person doing all the rest you might just have a point, just. But as it is saying there is no issue with the share of chores on the 12 year olds shoulders is ludicrous. 6 adults and only one of them would need to wash up after cooking more than one day a week.\n\nAnd all of that is relevant because it makes OP even less of the A because she is doing way more than her fair share of chores, yet her dad won't let her have privacy and called her *selfish*.", "Not about empathy but a decent parent would try and see the perspective and point of view of all his children. He has a daughter and it doesn\u2019t seem that he is considering her feelings at all. So yes not considering your child\u2019s feelings does make you a garbage parent. And that 12 year old came here to a form of strangers asking for advice.", "No, I\u2019m doubling down out of experience not defensiveness\nThe tidying after cooking takes the same amount of time if not longer. \n\nAll this \u2018probably\u2019 takes longer / takes less time is completely irrelevant. We don\u2019t know how long it takes, nor do we know how long her siblings spend doing stuff \n\nSo you judging the fathers parenting over this is cruel and not what OP asked for. \n\nMy comment literally says he should not have called her selfish and that he was wrong to", "> The tidying after cooking takes the same amount of time if not longer.\n\nEven if we say that's true, she is doing *all* the cooking with 6 adults left to divy up the washing up. \n\nWhat's cruel is reinforcing that it's fine and fair that a 12 year old does all the cooking and laundry for herself and 6 other adults. If her family tells her that's fine, and people like you tell her that's fine rather than take the tiny flick to your pride that it would be to admit you hadn't considered the chore allocation when you first commented about how well her dad was doing, she will believe that it is fine. It is not fine. She is doing way more than her fair share despite being the only child in the flat. It is not fine.\n\nAnyone who has ever been responsible for a household, even if they were living alone, knows doing the cooking and the laundry are the chores that take the longest, and cooking is the one that takes the most effort.\n\nThe only way that's not true is if someone lives in a giant house that takes ages to hoover. But this is a two bed one bath flat, so no.\n\nIf you want to continue reinforcing that the only child and only girl should spending more time and effort doing chores than the 6 adult men she lives with, go right ahead. I'm not going to continue going round this circle with you because it's too frustrating and makes me too sad for OP and what the world is setting her up to accept as normal."]}
