This dog barked very loudly as soon as I walked in, cowers against my mom at all times, wanders listlessly and cries whenever she leaves, and whenever I walked out of my room would bark aggressively, and once rushed up to me barking and growling. I told her he needed training, but no, she says he would never bite. \n\nShortly after, he snapped at her friends young daughter when they met on a walk.

My husband hugged me while my mother took our picture, and Max ran up to me and grabbed my pant leg and ripped it off from the knee down. Oh no, he thought I was being hurt and was protecting me!

This kind of behavior is unfair to the dog because, as you said, when it hurts someone, it's the one that will pay with its life. Your mom is a terrible, irresponsible pet owner, and she is TA for her selfishness.", "NTA.  In my country if that dog bites someone, especially a child, it would be impounded and euthanised.  I wonder how your mom would feel about that?  It is irresponsible of her to not get the dog some training, not only for the safety of people but for the dog as well.", "NTA. That dog is for sure a liability and will attack someone. Especially if it is biting at people that it knows. And that is a working breed so if that extra energy is probably being expressed in unhealthy ways.", "You're completely right, but they're just not listening.\n\nTry a different approach. Show them some videos of clicker training. The dog enjoys the training and gets treats. It's like a game. That may get them to at least look at it in a different light.", "NTA. The dog is definitely going to bite a kid before it's all over with.", "NTA. I have a dog and have quite a few friends that also have them and I have **never** had my pant leg ripped off by one.\n\nHowever, there are a couple things here that are common (and non-harmful) dog behaviors\n\n\\- barking at someone entering, yeah it's annoying and of course they should be told \"No!\", but it's not dangerous\n\n\\- whining/crying when someone leaves (this used to happened a lot with my sister's dog, but it lessened over time.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My other family members have an 80lb poodle who barks constantly. But it doesn\u2019t sound ferocious or menacing, just loud. This dog barks like it\u2019s terrified, not just being a dog. It\u2019s very loud, very fast, tail down, posture low, and teeth halfway out. It is a scary bark. \n\nAs far as the wining, it it like he cannot stay still. He wanders for hours crying, and will pick at himself if left too long. My mom cannot and will not leave him home alone for more than 30 minutes a result. She even will take him to the grocery store. If she must be gone for longer, she takes him to a friends house.", "Thanks for the clarification. The added info definitely makes this even more concerning. That kind of bark is NOT GOOD.\n\nYour mom is coddling him like parents who let their children misbehave without any consequences do. Taking a (non-working) dog to a grocery store?!?!\n\nIt sucks that your family is excusing and enabling the terrible behavior and calling you \"anti-dog\" for it. I *love* dogs and I would **certainly not** want to be near a dog like that. And your gut feeling is 100% right!"]}
