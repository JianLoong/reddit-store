I'd be holding your ground on this. How he perceived it is on him.", "All the posts saying apologize to keep the peace are dead wrong, in my experience. OP, never apologize to anyone just to sweep things under the rug. If you give in on this, your FIL will take it as permission to stomp all over any boundaries you and your wife set.

And that\u2019s how it should be. Controlling when someone puts on a jacket or if they can go to a store by themself is only for small children or folks with developmental delays.

She likely has a condition that doesn\u2019t allow her to feel temperatures, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from affecting her body the same as they do anyone else. The problem is she won\u2019t realize it so she can easily get heat stroke, frost bite, hypothermia etc. It can actually be extremely dangerous. \n\nHer parents should have picked up on this when she was a young child and taught her to always check the temperature before going out, and what temperatures to wear what types of clothes. By adulthood this should be so ingrained in her that it\u2019s second nature. Not having taught her this borders on negligence on the part of her parents.", "I'd be worried that if she herself isnt dressing for the weather, she wouldn't dress the babies correctly either.

Do not apologize. You do it once, it will happen again.", "NTA. Your wife is an adult and she has the ability to go out when she wants to whenever she wants to without a minder. \nIf she chooses to not wear a coat, again her choice. FIL is an AH for yelling at you for something she chose to do.", "NTA Some people really like the cold. I don't get it but your wife is old enough to dress herself and you're right, you're not her babysitter.", "Lol. I grew up going through proper NE winters in gym shorts and t-shirts. Hoodia at the most, never pants. I don't have any medical conditions I'm aware of.", "Better if he does. Bet this wife who goes out in a t-shirt and gets her own chocolates will have some comments too!!", "NTA but I do wonder about your wife. She may not think too much of the weather (and as some other commenters have said, may have some medical condition) but it does still affect her body. It might be good to see what she thinks about mindfully wearing more appropriate and protective clothing for cold weather to model it for your children. It can be hard enough to get littles to wear appropriate clothing without having a parent who just goes out in a t-shirt in the snow! And babies are definitely more susceptible to temperature changes, to the point it can be dangerous. You can still tell FIL to stuff it tho, lol.", "NTA. And I know you said she's always been like this in the cold, but after I had twins my body was a roaring fire for about 2 years, so add that onto your considerations. This was Wisconsin, so also cold winters.", "NTA sounds like the rest of the family is resigned to the fact that FIL is an ass. While you're here maybe take the time to decide how you want to deal with him the next time you see him. Preparation is key to dealing with terrible family. Trust me.", "Some people genuinely feel fine and do fine at lower temps, especially through their teens and twenties. A healthy and energetic young woman may genuinely be okay. One of my young adult kids is like that, and so was I when I was younger. (I had my twins in my 30s and didn\u2019t bounce back like I did from having my oldest in my 20s\u2014my temperature regulation went to heck.)"]}
