Sorry this blew up more than I expected it too. \n\nFirst thing I want to address. She does now in fact have a safe place to go, that is away from my children. \n\nSecond, I agree. I could have done things differently. But upon watching the video of when I asked her, I was very calm, didn\u2019t have a raised voice, and did not come off as treating at all. To those saying that you can\u2019t be angry while calm, yes. Yes you can. \n\nThird: I was very angry about the giving of melatonin, but now that I\u2019ve calmed a bit, what I\u2019m most angry about is giving my child something to try and sedate her, so that she (sam) could sleep longer because she didn\u2019t feel good and is tired. Which I do in fact have her admitting on camera. She has told us no to baby sitting multiple times, which is okay. I do not use it as a tool to control. I promise. She is able to come and go as she pleases, if she needs money or anything I didn\u2019t hesitate to help out because of my own personal up bringing. Sam does in fact know that it is a night time only thing, recommended by my child\u2019s doctor, as she recently watched my child over night (for the first time ever.) while my husband and I took one night away. Not a weekend. Not a week. Not even a full 24 hours. Just one night. \n\nFourth: looking back through our footage, I have caught more instances of this on the times I completely left the home with her watching the kids. I have two of the tamest children. Do they get wild occasionally, yes. But no matter what, my child should not have been given anything under the thought it would help induce sedation. \n\nFifth: I had full hands walking out of the house today, and just asked her to lock and turn the alarm on. I didn\u2019t think it was a hard task, but I take responsibility for not doing it myself. \n\nSix: somewhere I explained in a comment that when I came in to use the restroom, I was angry about the door situation. I also originally assumed that they were watching a movie or something in her room, which they have done plenty of times. I should have clarified that I didn\u2019t realize she was putting them to sleep until I watched the camera, and that when I came back home for the 2nd time is when I actively caught her in the act of sleeping. When hubs and I left this am, we had fully woken her up and she was having a FULL conversation with us before we headed out the door, she was sitting on our couch. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is long and confusing. I was angry and in fight or flight when writing this. Mostly worried about my child. For things I have done wrong, I will accept responsibility. 100%, but I will also not put my children\u2019s health and safety at risk. Ever. \n\n\n\nHi there, I apologize in advance because I\u2019m so angry I\u2019m shaking. \n\nMy (f26) and husband(28) took in one of my little sisters friends (f18, just shy of 19). Let\u2019s call her Sam. Sam has been with us for almost a full year, and we\u2019ve been taking care of her. We also have two small children (3 &1) who live in our home as well. \n\nWe occasionally ask Sam to watch the kids for us when we have errands to run or want a date night etc. She graduated high school in May, and did not have a job over the summer nor paid any sort of bills, so we didn\u2019t think it was a huge ask considering we pay everything. Cellphone, shoes, clothes, anything she needs.\n\nWe just finally trusted Sam enough to watch the kids over night so we could go out of town to celebrate our anniversary. Everything went fine and we returned home with no issues. Or so we thought. \n\nToday, I had some errands to run while husband went to work, so I asked Sam to watch the kids for about 2 hours last evening. Sam is in no way a morning, and it\u2019s VERY apparent. For reference this is at 7:12 am. The kids had just gotten up at 6:30.\n\nThis morning when she got up to watch the kids, she instantly fell asleep back on the couch. Husband and I had to wake her up before we left. We have a car in the shop currently so I was dropping him off then doing my errands. I had to use the restroom after dropping him off so I stopped back home, to find my house door unlocked and the home alarm not turned on. Sam was in the room with the kids sleeping. This was at 7:50 am. She had no idea I ever entered the house. I was angry but got back into my car to go do what I needed to do. \n\nWhile I was driving, I had a nagging feeling to check the living room camera from after the time we left. What I see on the camera horrified me as a mom. Not even 10 minutes after we left, Sam goes to the spot we keep the children\u2019s melatonin (my child is autistic and takes it nightly) and proceeds to plop one into my child\u2019s mouth. \n\nI saw red I sent the video to my husband to confirm what I saw, and he agreed. I then also sent it to my mom to triple check. I fly home and go inside to confront her. She lies and lies to me until she tells me that she actually did do it. \n\nI told her that she needed to be out of my house today by 1pm. And she had a total meltdown. She gave me every reason in the book as to why she did it, and freaked out that she has no where to go. \n\nI told a few people because I\u2019m so upset I\u2019m crying. I had some people who agreed with me, but some saying I shouldn\u2019t kick her out since she has no where to go. Making me feel horrible. \n\nSo my question to you is; AITA for kicking her out over giving my child melatonin?", "created_utc": 1698337757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h0fae/aita_for_kicking_out_sisters_friend_over_melatonin/", "score": 2531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She watched your kids last night or this morning? Or both? Did she give the kid a gummy this morning so he\u2019d sleep and she could too? Or was that last night?", "INFO\n\nCan she say \"no\" to watching the kids?", "INFO: Is it even legal to evict someone who's been living with you that long with such little notice?

But I don\u2019t think your hands are totally clean here, and this is why: \n\nFirst: there\u2019s a power dynamic here. Sam is completely economically dependent on you and your husband (not totally sure why, but setting that aside for now) and since you have no familial or other bonds, Sam has an _incredibly_ precarious position in your household. That means no matter what you may think or intend, what you ask Sam to do has an implied \u201cor else\u201d attached to it. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s not clear to me that Sam knew the thing that is so obvious to you - that giving your child the melatonin in the morning was the wrong thing to do (since you give your child the melatonin at night, and the only effect is helping them sleep). \n\nFinally, it\u2019s not clear to me that you explicitly gave Sam clear instructions on how to watch your kids, and what not to do. You may have thought that living with you would be enough \u2014 that Sam would pick up the details by osmosis. But living in a family\u2019s household while not being a caregiver to a child is very different than being a child\u2019s caregiver. That difficulty is increased when a kid has a need for routine, like your kid does, and it\u2019s doubled when there are multiple small kids. \n\nSam didn\u2019t do the right thing, and neither did you.", "So you knew this woman wasn\u2019t really prepared to watch kids early in the morning, none the less an autistic child who has needs that are different than normal children, and left her anyway? On top of that she left the front door of your home unlocked and you decided to continue your own personal irresponsibility by leaving the kids there in a situation you personally got to see was completely unsafe for them to be in? ESH", "YTA. While that wasn't very responsible of her, I don't think you fully understand how melatonin works. Its not a sedative, it does not make you fall asleep, it simply helps with your sleep cycle. Melatonin is essentially a vitamin and is necessary to the human brain. A little extra melatonin is not gonna cause any harm. But there was still no reason to give the child extra melatonin.", "ESH\nHer for giving melatonin to your kid after waking up.\nYou for leaving her alone the weekend and then again with two toddlers (1 neurodivergent)\u2026 this is pro nanny job.

Doesn't matter if you're taking care of the costs of her life or not.", "Lmao @ the people saying she \u201cdrugged him\u201d. By that logic you the parent \u201cdrug him\u201d nightly.\n\nBtw using it nightly builds a dependency.", "ESH.

And one of your kids is neurodivergent?! She\u2019s overwhelmed. She also shouldn\u2019t be giving the neurodivergent kid melatonin outside of his bedtime, but you shouldn\u2019t be taking advantage of the no job, kicked out into the streets, teenager that just graduated high school this year.", "Op your 100% the AH. She gave them a dietary supplement that can help someone who is already sleepy get to sleep. Instead of having a talk about it with them and explaining your not ok with that (which is your right as a parent) you broke the law and forced a tenant out of there home with a few hours notice. If that's not bad enough during the past year instead of helping said tenant get on there feet you used them as a free babysitter and basically used the power dynamic to ensure you kept a free babysitter.", "INFO. How often do you leave the house without locking the door? Why did you see her sleeping when she was supposed to be watching the kids and do nothing?", "Everyone kinda sucks here.  She should be working or in a college and not letting you support her.  You should require some type of rent and not be enabling her to do nothing.  \n\nYou should not feel entitled to her babysitting because your have failed to make the requirement listed above.  \n\nShe fails because she should have told you no to the last minute babysitting and for giving the kid\u2019s melatonin for breakfast. But she probably feels like she can\u2019t say no because, ya know, above.  \n\nEveryone failed here.", "YTA.\n\nI think what this really boils down to is one person did something objectively questionable and another person did something objectively bad.\n\nShe shouldn't have given your kid melatonin. Let's get that right out. Maybe she thought it would make them sleepy, allowing her to go back to sleep or maybe they were just being particularly active and she thought it would calm them down, who knows. Either way, it was not a great thing to do but I just don't believe that there could honestly have been any malicious intent in giving your kid a small dose of such a ridiculously mild supplement.\n\nYou and your husband, on the other hand, left her with your kids even after you had doubts. It doesn't matter if it only took 10 minutes for you to get go back to the house. Did she do something stupid? Yes, obviously, but teenagers are fkng stupid. They do dumb things all the time and this, while dumb, wasn't that bad. It's fkng melatonin, something safer than your average breakfast cereal. You're the adult here right? You made a bad decision that created a bad situation and, when the next bad decision happened (Sam's) your reaction wasn't to recognize that this was a multi-faceted problem you caused and a learning moment, but to rage and throw this girl out on the street? YTA.", "ESH\n\nLeaving kids, one being autistic, with a sleeping person was on you\n\nTeenager should not be giving out supplements without approval of the parents. \n\nKicking her out without notice though makes you the far bigger AH of the bunch IMO.

You know she\u2019s not a morning person, you know you and your husband had to try to wake her up to leave, you stopped back home and knew they were all asleep which was weird and you left again anyway. I mean, that\u2019s all wild and you had so many chances to stop this before it started.\n\nShe absolutely SHOULD NOT have given them melatonin to make them easier to care for, but it was the kid\u2019s melatonin so it\u2019s not like she introduced a new drug. I think people are pushing it with assault charges on that one, and for you to be crying shaking with anger over a supplement you give the kid every night is an overreaction. It\u2019s melatonin. Not cocaine.\n\nYou need to give her more time to find a place to live, but yeah, there\u2019s probably no coming back from that.\n\nESH", "Melatonin?

You get what you pay for", "[removed]", "YTA why did you leave the house again when you seen that she was sleeping?", "ESH-   If Sam isn't a morning person and wasn't finished sleeping, it wasn't cool of you to ask her to babysit.   That would be the equivalent of waking someone up at 3 am and saying \"Hey can you just watch the kids for two hours while I go run some errands?\".   You're TA for asking her to provide childcare during her normal sleep hours. \n\nShe is for sure TA for drugging your kid so she could sleep more, but to be honest, she probably didn't consider it to be drugging.  It's likely that she didn't think this through.  She likely thought that melatonin was a natural herbal supplement with minimal harmful effects.  Still not great to drug a kid, but she wasn't giving her nyquil or weed gummies or something like that.  I don't think her intent was harm.  Her actions were dumb, but not malicious.  \n\nYou are not TA for being upset that this happened, but you're TA for giving her only a few hours notice to move out of her home.  That is an illegal eviction.  She has rights even if she isn't paying rent.

Did the kid mess up? For sure. But she did it because she\u2019s seen you do it. If she wasn\u2019t provided instructions for when the melatonin is appropriate to give, how would she know? The insinuation that your child was drugged is asinine. You\u2019re making an 18 year old homeless for a mistake that was precipitated by your actions. Not to mention the fact you likely can\u2019t legally just kick her out with such short notice when she lives there.", "Your reacting as if she shot your kid up with heroin or something. Yeah it's not great to give a kid melatonin in the morning but it's not going to damage the kid or something. At worst you'll have a hard time getting it to sleep that night.", "NAH\n\nLook. She's a teenager. She's going to make the wrong call. That's part of it. \n\nShe gave your child a product you give them in a dose you give them. Should she have cleared it with you? Absolutely. But was it dangerous or should she think it was? Definitely not. \n\nShe made the wrong call but she did not endanger your child. \n\nConsidering not everyone locks their doors or has an alarm system, I also don't think not having them on is some crazy irresponsible thing either. \n\nTeenagers going to teenage.

It\u2019s not terribly often, MAYBE A FEW TIMES A WEEK!! \nFirstly that is not often it\u2019s VERY often. \nSecondly having her watch them overnight is completely taking advantage of her.

Let\u2019s make no mistake here you were benefiting just as much as she was so yeah that makes you the ah. \nHowever the medicating the child behind your back is also Ahole move.

I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m in so much shock about that. \n\nI will say on your end, having her watch the kids 3x is frequent. You need to find an actual babysitter and not have someone who\u2019s living in your house and can\u2019t stay awake for the life of her take care of your children. This isn\u2019t okay. You need to take the children with you or do errands in the later morning. NTA but you need to also do better as a responsible parent too.", "NTA! WTF! I have two young kids and would see red too! This is not okay. Trying to sedate little kids to make it easier on her??? She needs to grow up. She\u2019s not 13, she\u2019s almost 19 and can\u2019t stay awake to watch kids while living in a house paying no bills? I wouldn\u2019t trust her around my kids again. I wonder how many times she\u2019s already done that. This is so creepy!!!!!\n\nEdit: you\u2019re not kicking her out over melatonin. You\u2019re kicking her out for trying to sedate children in the morning so she didn\u2019t have to babysit. Seriously so creepy. Obviously, melatonin isn\u2019t a sedative, but that\u2019s what she was trying to do: make your kid tired so she didn\u2019t have to pay attention to him (when I saw in another comment) you asked her the night before is she could watch your kids. Again, I wouldn\u2019t trust this chick around my kids.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't have melatonin, would she have used cough syrup? Weed? Alcohol?\n\nThe intent is the same.

You confronted her about it. *She then proceeded to lie to you about what she had done with your child*. \n\nMaybe you ask her to watch the kids too much, I don't know. If you do, that would suck. But that lie is such an egregious violation of trust that I cannot fathom how anyone is saying YTA for wanting to kick her out. It overshadows every other part of the story, at least to me.\n\nHad she immediately admitted it and tried to justify it, even if it was the wrong thing to do, then I think this would be a YTA.\n\nAs it stands, she lied to your face about what she gave your child, all seemingly in service of sleeping longer (unless I misread that part). \n\nStrong NTA from me....", "Why did you take in your sisters friend in the first place? What responsibility of that was yours. YTA, you came home, realized the alarm wasn\u2019t set and the door was unlocked.

BUT, I will say that her just popping any kind of medication, vitamin, supplement, anything in your child\u2019s mouth without your permission or knowledge is INSANE. She knew exactly what she was doing and she did it because she wanted to go back to sleep. Do i think you should kick her out? Well idk that depends on the role she plays in your house. Why is she there? To what end is she going to be there? It seems like you\u2019re raising her and it\u2019s been an entire year.", "NTA you already give her a free place to stay plus phone food and clothes, ya she should be watching the kids, she could always get a real job if she wants", "NTA. \n\nSam will find out real quickly watching some kids a few times is way better then being in a homeless shelter..\n\n\nThis reminds me of the saying \"No good deed goes unpunished\". You should have zero regrets or sympathy.", "NTA - But you know if she plants her feet you'll have ot go through the legal process to end her residency there, right?

Let\u2019s call her Sam. Sam has been with us for almost a full year, and we\u2019ve been taking care of her. We also have two small children (3 &1) who live in our home as well. \n\nWe occasionally ask Sam to watch the kids for us when we have errands to run or want a date night etc. She graduated high school in May, and did not have a job over the summer nor paid any sort of bills, so we didn\u2019t think it was a huge ask considering we pay everything. Cellphone, shoes, clothes, anything she needs.\n\nWe just finally trusted Sam enough to watch the kids over night so we could go out of town to celebrate our anniversary. Everything went fine and we returned home with no issues. Or so we thought. \n\nToday, I had some errands to run while husband went to work, so I asked Sam to watch the kids for about 2 hours last evening. Sam is in no way a morning, and it\u2019s VERY apparent. For reference this is at 7:12 am. The kids had just gotten up at 6:30.\n\nThis morning when she got up to watch the kids, she instantly fell asleep back on the couch. Husband and I had to wake her up before we left. We have a car in the shop currently so I was dropping him off then doing my errands. I had to use the restroom after dropping him off so I stopped back home, to find my house door unlocked and the home alarm not turned on. Sam was in the room with the kids sleeping. This was at 7:50 am. She had no idea I ever entered the house. I was angry but got back into my car to go do what I needed to do. \n\nWhile I was driving, I had a nagging feeling to check the living room camera from after the time we left. What I see on the camera horrified me as a mom. Not even 10 minutes after we left, Sam goes to the spot we keep the children\u2019s melatonin (my child is autistic and takes it nightly) and proceeds to plop one into my child\u2019s mouth. \n\nI saw red I sent the video to my husband to confirm what I saw, and he agreed. I then also sent it to my mom to triple check. I fly home and go inside to confront her. She lies and lies to me until she tells me that she actually did do it. \n\nI told her that she needed to be out of my house today by 1pm. And she had a total meltdown. She gave me every reason in the book as to why she did it, and freaked out that she has no where to go. \n\nI told a few people because I\u2019m so upset I\u2019m crying. I had some people who agreed with me, but some saying I shouldn\u2019t kick her out since she has no where to go. Making me feel horrible. \n\nSo my question to you is; AITA for kicking her out over giving my child melatonin?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[deleted]", "NTA.

It's time she begins her adult life and gets a job and finds someplace else to live.  Also tell Sam the cellphone bill will be paid for another month and then you're dropping her from your plan.", "While giving your child any sort of medication without your permission is absolutley grounds to immediately boot her- I'd be more interested in knowing why Sam couldn't stay awake after a full night of sleep?

Just because it helps with sleeping and your sleep cycle doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. You can\u2019t just give a child (a goddamn toddler) more than the recommended dose, which is what she was doing. The effects could have been serious!\n\nAlso, she did this for selfish reasons. She just wanted to go back to sleep. She didn\u2019t care for their well-being, about their needs, she just wanted sleep, which is ultimately a big issue.\n\nIf my understanding is correct. She got up to babysit and fell asleep. You woke her up when you left to drop your husband off, came back to her sleeping again. You left, to when she woke up, and that\u2019s when the incident occurred, right?  Because if so, that\u2019s shitty of her.

They never felt able to speak up because they had nowhere to go and just needed to make it to college and get out. \n\nIF you move a teen into your home you need to be super clear on what you are offering them and what you expect from them in return.

She may also not make the best decisions because she is 18!

She should be working or doing all that she can to contribute to the household that is providing her with everything she needs and more.\n\nETA: Also, explicit instructions or not, Sam was so far in the wrong to drug OP's child back to sleep in the morning once they were already up and out of bed.

The power dynamic is unavoidable (nevermind that if they want a live-in nanny, expenses should be paid along with an additional salary), communication about expectations is suspect, and this whole thing doesn't need to be a big deal. \n\nObviously drugging a kid isn't a good thing, but it's only melatonin.

There's pressure \n- Ask her to tidy after herself? She's gonna feel that or else her living situation depends on it\n- Ask her to do some household errands? Better get it right, or else you're out\n- Ask her to do chores?\n\nLiterally what you're describing is a situation where an 18 is ENTITLED to live with someone pressure free and not obligated to pay rent, bc if the 18 yo doesn't pay rent she's out on her feet.

I'm at work, I feel pressure to do my job well or else I'll lose it. I feel pressure to make sure I'm adhering to all rules in the presence of authority. It didn't matter if the friend was 18 or 58, that power dynamic of being economically dependent will always exist. We don't chide SAHParents when their partner is economically dependent on someone else and sure you can argue it's a familial relationship that's fair, but who is anyone to criticize an 18 yo who accepts free lodging they need at risk of babysitting a few hours a week and a couple who asks for reasonable things. It's not like the friend is being put on blast for feeding the child too much, or keeping them up late watching movies, it's a highly negligible thing to feed a child drugs unwarranted and if you think the friend is too immature to warrant such a task, then I have news for you about being 18 and homeless, it's expected unless you have parents that will take care of you, that you provide yourself your own job, funds to live and feed yourself. \n\nIt seems like a reasonable scenario and the analysis' being pulled from it are so hyper critical.", "I think it\u2019s more ESH.

How often would she do this if you hadn't caught her? It is incredibly inappropriate for her to be giving any kind of medication or supplement without your permission.

Asshole move? Sure, 100%. But it's not like she used ambien or any actual sleeping pills that stood a real chance of knocking your kid out.

The fact that\u2019s she has refused pay is likely because you have the attitude that it is the least she can do and she is *nineteen*.  You should be the adult that you are and compensate her fairly.  Deducting room and board is totally fair, not paying her is not.\n\n3. Two toddlers are challenging.  A toddler with special needs is even more so.  And, yes, L1 is still special needs.  And she\u2019s nineteen, which is basically just a kid.  I am guessing that she is feeling overwhelmed.\n\n4. Concerning the melatonin, you realize that most parents do not drug their children to make them sleep, yes?  In fact, using sleep aids can cause dependency and melatonin in particular carries a risk of poisoning and side effects.  I think you are most at fault here for even giving this to your child as an easier way to handle bedtime vs. the 19yo who likely thinks that these gummies are harmless, as many do about OTC meds.\n\nMy ultimate verdict is that you should simply speak to her about this.  And you should start paying her because this is basically a job.  I mean\u2026could she get a job outside your home when you expect her to watch your children so much?\n\nOh, and on the subject of being free to go home\u2026why did she choose to just leave home?

We couldn't let them become dependent on us and just then decide to like... move to a different state. And if they do ever need to move in with us, we will have a clear, written contract of what support we will provide and what household responsibilities we'd expect them to take on (not in payment but as part of being in the household) and what behavior would not be okay in our home (as well a structure for dealing with infractions we could all agree on but that would not be \"you violated an unwritten rule and now you are homeless\").", "I'm not definitively saying she did this, but as someone that used to be a kid, you can usually guess what the \"correct\" answer to a question is based on the tone of voice asking (read: sometimes screaming and yelling) it.\n\nVery anecdotal experience, but kids lie when they think they're going to get in trouble, even if they didn't know what they were doing was wrong until after the fact.", "Cause she's freaking out that she's gonna be fucking homeless at 18.

Sam is completely economically dependent on you and your husband \n\nOOP stated that they always asked for her availability and that other sitters are also available in-case she says no.

This is not her first rodeo of babysitting. Let's not expect OOP to walk us thru her first experience of babysitting. This is an AITAH, not a diary.

The care of your kids with pretty high needs really shouldn\u2019t be taken that lightly. Also, it\u2019s good you had the camera and stuff, but why is it on if someone is watching the kids?
