Let\u2019s call her Sam. Sam has been with us for almost a full year, and we\u2019ve been taking care of her. We also have two small children (3 &1) who live in our home as well. \n\nWe occasionally ask Sam to watch the kids for us when we have errands to run or want a date night etc. She graduated high school in May, and did not have a job over the summer nor paid any sort of bills, so we didn\u2019t think it was a huge ask considering we pay everything. Cellphone, shoes, clothes, anything she needs.\n\nWe just finally trusted Sam enough to watch the kids over night so we could go out of town to celebrate our anniversary. Everything went fine and we returned home with no issues. Or so we thought. \n\nToday, I had some errands to run while husband went to work, so I asked Sam to watch the kids for about 2 hours last evening. Sam is in no way a morning, and it\u2019s VERY apparent. For reference this is at 7:12 am. The kids had just gotten up at 6:30.\n\nThis morning when she got up to watch the kids, she instantly fell asleep back on the couch. Husband and I had to wake her up before we left. We have a car in the shop currently so I was dropping him off then doing my errands. I had to use the restroom after dropping him off so I stopped back home, to find my house door unlocked and the home alarm not turned on. Sam was in the room with the kids sleeping. This was at 7:50 am. She had no idea I ever entered the house. I was angry but got back into my car to go do what I needed to do. \n\nWhile I was driving, I had a nagging feeling to check the living room camera from after the time we left. What I see on the camera horrified me as a mom. Not even 10 minutes after we left, Sam goes to the spot we keep the children\u2019s melatonin (my child is autistic and takes it nightly) and proceeds to plop one into my child\u2019s mouth. \n\nI saw red I sent the video to my husband to confirm what I saw, and he agreed. I then also sent it to my mom to triple check. I fly home and go inside to confront her. She lies and lies to me until she tells me that she actually did do it. \n\nI told her that she needed to be out of my house today by 1pm. And she had a total meltdown. She gave me every reason in the book as to why she did it, and freaked out that she has no where to go. \n\nI told a few people because I\u2019m so upset I\u2019m crying. I had some people who agreed with me, but some saying I shouldn\u2019t kick her out since she has no where to go. Making me feel horrible. \n\nSo my question to you is; AITA for kicking her out over giving my child melatonin?", "created_utc": 1698337757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h0fae/aita_for_kicking_out_sisters_friend_over_melatonin/", "score": 580, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She watched your kids last night or this morning? Or both? Did she give the kid a gummy this morning so he\u2019d sleep and she could too? Or was that last night?", "INFO\n\nCan she say \"no\" to watching the kids?", "INFO: Is it even legal to evict someone who's been living with you that long with such little notice? Seems like even if I grant that you're right in everything else, Sam is a tenant who has rights.", "This is pretty tangled up, and I hate to say it, but NAH. \n\nI get your mama bear outrage and desire to protect your baby. But I don\u2019t think your hands are totally clean here, and this is why: \n\nFirst: there\u2019s a power dynamic here. Sam is completely economically dependent on you and your husband (not totally sure why, but setting that aside for now) and since you have no familial or other bonds, Sam has an _incredibly_ precarious position in your household. That means no matter what you may think or intend, what you ask Sam to do has an implied \u201cor else\u201d attached to it. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s not clear to me that Sam knew the thing that is so obvious to you - that giving your child the melatonin in the morning was the wrong thing to do (since you give your child the melatonin at night, and the only effect is helping them sleep). \n\nFinally, it\u2019s not clear to me that you explicitly gave Sam clear instructions on how to watch your kids, and what not to do. You may have thought that living with you would be enough \u2014 that Sam would pick up the details by osmosis. But living in a family\u2019s household while not being a caregiver to a child is very different than being a child\u2019s caregiver. That difficulty is increased when a kid has a need for routine, like your kid does, and it\u2019s doubled when there are multiple small kids. \n\nSam didn\u2019t do the right thing, and neither did you.", "So you knew this woman wasn\u2019t really prepared to watch kids early in the morning, none the less an autistic child who has needs that are different than normal children, and left her anyway? On top of that she left the front door of your home unlocked and you decided to continue your own personal irresponsibility by leaving the kids there in a situation you personally got to see was completely unsafe for them to be in? ESH", "YTA. While that wasn't very responsible of her, I don't think you fully understand how melatonin works. Its not a sedative, it does not make you fall asleep, it simply helps with your sleep cycle. Melatonin is essentially a vitamin and is necessary to the human brain. A little extra melatonin is not gonna cause any harm. But there was still no reason to give the child extra melatonin.", "ESH\nHer for giving melatonin to your kid after waking up.\nYou for leaving her alone the weekend and then again with two toddlers (1 neurodivergent)\u2026 this is pro nanny job. And then leaving her on the street  basically with only couple of hours of notice.", "ESH - you left your toddlers with someone who was fast asleep?  yeah, you own some of this. \n\nWhat she did is wrong too, no question, but you also came home, saw she was asleep, then left without the kids, leaving them with a sleeping person. \n\nNone of you are acting responsible in this situation. \n\nAlso, parentification of someone who isn't even your kid is... no more okay than if she were your kid.  Doesn't matter if you're taking care of the costs of her life or not.", "Lmao @ the people saying she \u201cdrugged him\u201d. By that logic you the parent \u201cdrug him\u201d nightly.\n\nBtw using it nightly builds a dependency.", "ESH. Sounds like you\u2019re asking too much from a recently kicked out teenager and then taking advantage of her no job to babysit your kids pretty frequently\u2026 do you even pay her??? And one of your kids is neurodivergent?! She\u2019s overwhelmed. She also shouldn\u2019t be giving the neurodivergent kid melatonin outside of his bedtime, but you shouldn\u2019t be taking advantage of the no job, kicked out into the streets, teenager that just graduated high school this year.", "Op your 100% the AH. She gave them a dietary supplement that can help someone who is already sleepy get to sleep. Instead of having a talk about it with them and explaining your not ok with that (which is your right as a parent) you broke the law and forced a tenant out of there home with a few hours notice. If that's not bad enough during the past year instead of helping said tenant get on there feet you used them as a free babysitter and basically used the power dynamic to ensure you kept a free babysitter.", "INFO. How often do you leave the house without locking the door? Why did you see her sleeping when she was supposed to be watching the kids and do nothing?", "Everyone kinda sucks here.  She should be working or in a college and not letting you support her.  You should require some type of rent and not be enabling her to do nothing.  \n\nYou should not feel entitled to her babysitting because your have failed to make the requirement listed above.  \n\nShe fails because she should have told you no to the last minute babysitting and for giving the kid\u2019s melatonin for breakfast. But she probably feels like she can\u2019t say no because, ya know, above.  \n\nEveryone failed here.", "YTA.\n\nI think what this really boils down to is one person did something objectively questionable and another person did something objectively bad.\n\nShe shouldn't have given your kid melatonin. Let's get that right out. Maybe she thought it would make them sleepy, allowing her to go back to sleep or maybe they were just being particularly active and she thought it would calm them down, who knows. Either way, it was not a great thing to do but I just don't believe that there could honestly have been any malicious intent in giving your kid a small dose of such a ridiculously mild supplement.\n\nYou and your husband, on the other hand, left her with your kids even after you had doubts. It doesn't matter if it only took 10 minutes for you to get go back to the house. Did she do something stupid? Yes, obviously, but teenagers are fkng stupid. They do dumb things all the time and this, while dumb, wasn't that bad. It's fkng melatonin, something safer than your average breakfast cereal. You're the adult here right? You made a bad decision that created a bad situation and, when the next bad decision happened (Sam's) your reaction wasn't to recognize that this was a multi-faceted problem you caused and a learning moment, but to rage and throw this girl out on the street? YTA.", "ESH\n\nLeaving kids, one being autistic, with a sleeping person was on you\n\nTeenager should not be giving out supplements without approval of the parents. \n\nKicking her out without notice though makes you the far bigger AH of the bunch IMO.  I hope karma bites you in the ass for that someday.", "I mean, this is really poor thinking on your part. You saw the girl this morning. She clearly was in no position to watch the kids this morning. You know she\u2019s not a morning person, you know you and your husband had to wake her up to leave, you stopped back home and knew they were all asleep which was weird and you left again anyway. I mean, that\u2019s all wild and you had so many chances to stop this before it started.\n\nShe absolutely SHOULD NOT have given them melatonin to make them easier to care for, but it was the kid\u2019s melatonin so it\u2019s not like she introduced a new drug. I think people are pushing it with assault charges on that one, and for you to be crying shaking with anger over a supplement you give the kid every night is an overreaction. It\u2019s melatonin. Not cocaine.\n\nYou need to give her more time to find a place to live, but yeah, there\u2019s probably no coming back from that.\n\nESH", "Melatonin? The thing that if you take it at similar times over a few days it'll generally help encourage sleep? \n\nWhat's next? Caffeine?", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have left your children with someone who clearly was asleep and would likely fall asleep again. She shouldn\u2019t have been giving them melatonin in the morning though. Both of you made bad decisions.", "I\u2019m a nanny. YTA for leaving two toddlers under 4 with an 18 yo overnight. That\u2019s just a dumb idea all around. \u201cWe finally trusted Sam enough\u2026\u201d She\u2019s a teenager!! Oh my god.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. \nYou suck for letting her live with you and being fine with her having no job and no school, which makes it awfully convenient for her to watch you kids, which the frequency of which keeps changing in you comments. \nShe sucks for melatonining the kids again to sleep in. We know what melatonin is, so does she, or she wouldn\u2019t have used it. \nYour husband also sucks cause he\u2019s like what your passenger in all this? \nLay down real expectations of yourself and this girl you\u2019ve got living with you, or throw her out and get actual child care. You get what you pay for", "[removed]", "YTA why did you leave the house again when you seen that she was sleeping?", "ESH-   If Sam isn't a morning person and wasn't finished sleeping, it wasn't cool of you to ask her to babysit.   That would be the equivalent of waking someone up at 3 am and saying \"Hey can you just watch the kids for two hours while I go run some errands?\".   You're TA for asking her to provide childcare during her normal sleep hours. \n\nShe is for sure TA for drugging your kid so she could sleep more, but to be honest, she probably didn't consider it to be drugging.  It's likely that she didn't think this through.  She likely thought that melatonin was a natural herbal supplement with minimal harmful effects.  Still not great to drug a kid, but she wasn't giving her nyquil or weed gummies or something like that.  I don't think her intent was harm.  Her actions were dumb, but not malicious.  \n\nYou are not TA for being upset that this happened, but you're TA for giving her only a few hours notice to move out of her home.  That is an illegal eviction.  She has rights even if she isn't paying rent.  It's ok if you don't want her living with you, but you need to give her a reasonable time frame to leave.", "Extra melatonin can be dangerous for a young child, so I don't know why so many of you are trivialising it.", "YTA. Did the kid mess up? For sure. But she did it because she\u2019s seen you do it. If she wasn\u2019t provided instructions for when the melatonin is appropriate to give, how would she know? The insinuation that your child was drugged is asinine. You\u2019re making an 18 year old homeless for a mistake that was precipitated by your actions. Not to mention the fact you likely can\u2019t legally just kick her out with such short notice when she lives there.", "Your reacting as if she shot your kid up with heroin or something. Yeah it's not great to give a kid melatonin in the morning but it's not going to damage the kid or something. At worst you'll have a hard time getting it to sleep that night.", "NAH\n\nLook. She's a teenager. She's going to make the wrong call. That's part of it. \n\nShe gave your child a product you give them in a dose you give them. Should she have cleared it with you? Absolutely. But was it dangerous or should she think it was? Definitely not. \n\nShe made the wrong call but she did not endanger your child. \n\nConsidering not everyone locks their doors or has an alarm system, I also don't think not having them on is some crazy irresponsible thing either. \n\nTeenagers going to teenage. They will not make the same decisions you as a full-grown adult and parent will. \n\nYou are overreacting. It's not the end of the world - you can BOTH learn from this.", "Aitah? What's the big deal about melatonin? Why is this seeing red, shaking, crying worthy? Wtf?", "She does watch the kids occasionally. It\u2019s not terribly often, MAYBE A FEW TIMES A WEEK!! \nFirstly that is not often it\u2019s VERY often. \nSecondly having her watch them overnight is completely taking advantage of her. Add on top of that a child with autism. She\u2019s a teenager ffs. Of course she\u2019s not going to say no if your paying for everything AND you know it! Let\u2019s make no mistake here you were benefiting just as much as she was so yeah that makes you the ah. \nHowever the medicating the child behind your back is also Ahole move. Your over reaction though proves you weren\u2019t looking after her out of the goodness of your heart!", "Yta you took in a vulnerable child and you get her to watch your child every fortnight. And now overnight. And you let your kids with a sleeping young adult.", "YTA.  I understand how upset you could be.  But ultimately its harmless and you put a kid who had no proof of good child care in charge of a 1 and 3 year old.  To me that is way to much for a kid that age.", "I don't think you actually trusted Sam at all. You did have to go out and celebrate your aniversary and left them with a pre-adult. And really small children by the way. YTA and Sam, and your friend also.", "For understanding, you're furious and kicking her out for doing something you do every day?  Melatonin is perfectly safe, you know this I'm sure, and the girl gave her some in the morning when she's struggling to try and make it easier to watch your kid so it's not like she hurt your child or anything.  \nESH. She shouldn't have fallen asleep watching kids and should've asked about giving melatonin.  You knew she struggles in the mornings and asked her to watch the kids early anyways and you overreacted in regards to the melatonin considering you give it to them daily which I'm sure she knows how freely you give it to them.  Plus I don't think she had any malicious intent", "ESH. Unless you have a formal (written and signed) aupair relationship with Sam, she shouldn\u2019t be watching your kids without pay. Doesn\u2019t matter that she insists on not taking payment, pay her anyway. If you don\u2019t pay her, you\u2019re taking advantage of someone in need. If food/board exchanged for childcare is the written agreement, that\u2019s different, but you explained the living situation as charity, not business. I understand being pissed that someone gave your kid melatonin. Sam was wrong, but you also give melatonin to your kid, so I\u2019m not sure that Sam deserves to be in the street over this.", "ESH.

End of story.", "NTA\n\nShe drugged your child to make them easier to care for. Just kicking her out is kind. Getting her arrested wouldn't be unreasonable.", "This is at least an ESH. You came home to Sam sleeping whilst your kids were fast asleep. Instead of taking them with you and continuing your errands you knowingly left them with her . She shouldn\u2019t have drugged your child but you shouldn\u2019t have left your kid with someone incapable of looking after them .", "YTA You view her as a child in need and yet also as ready made help.\n\nTo me a healthy 13 year old should know better, but she isn't prepared to watch your kids who need a mindful adult. You knew better but are also expecting more than she is capable of.\n\nIf she is a child, help her as one and don't ask help of her. You are the adult, so you can say no when she offers help out of her reach.", "NTA I'd kick her ass out too. Tell Sam family so they can take her in or have the ppl that's against you kicking her out take her in instead.", "NTA she drugged your child.  She is lucky you don\u2019t use the video to press abuse charges.  On the other hand, if you did press charges she wouldn\u2019t be homeless anymore.

My husband and his mom have been mending their relationship. He thought it would be a good way to build the relationship again.", "The fuck is wrong with this woman. She gave your son melatonin so he'd go back to sleep and stop being in her hair and speaking from the perspective of someone who had that done to him as a child that's disgusting. I don't care how much of a morning person she is, that's just despicable.\n\nNTA for throwing her out on zero notice.", "SOFT YTA. My younger sister and I are 10 years apart. That means there were many times my parents asked me to babysit and I swear each time she was the most difficult child. I couldn't control her and my parents didn't back me up when I tried to get her to do as told. I started getting frustrated after getting in trouble for not being able to babysit her without there being a problem, so around her bedtime (when she was screaming and crying for her parents), I would give her benedryl. I had seen my parents do it before on car rides and thought it was an easy solution. \n\nShould I have done that? Maybe not. Should Sam have given melatonin to your kid? Maybe not. But it's not the worst thing she could have done. I really think you're overreacting about melatonin. In my opinion, I think you need to have a good conversation with Sam. Figure out why she's did it, talk to her why you're not okay with it and maybe see if she's even wanting to babysit your kids. I know you said it seems fair because y'all pay for everything, and I totally get that. But I've also been on the other side of things where I've felt obligated to do things I don't want to do because I feel like I owe someone for the things they've done for me.", "ESH. Obviously Sam was wrong for doing this. But you\u2019re also leaving your young kids with a teenager who doesn\u2019t seem to have the qualifications to babysit and clearly has no interest in doing so. \n\nWhen you took her in was there an agreement that she was to provide free babysitting? Because if not, it\u2019s pretty ridiculous to expect her to.", "Both parties are at fault here. You shouldn't leave your kids with a sleepy teenager. She shouldn't have lied. She knew it wasn't the right time to give him melatonin. She didn't drug him. You give it to him before bed right. It just wasn't the appropriate time for melatonin. You shouldn't kick her out with no where to go. Not cool. I think both parties need to apologize and come to realistic expectations of childcare and household chore duties.", "This girl is also a child and you\u2019re kicking her out as she\u2019s no one to you. Why took her in in a first place?", "Nta. An adult you trusted to watch your small children basically drugged them. I don\u2019t understand why people are making excuses for her.

I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m in so much shock about that. \n\nI will say on your end, having her watch the kids 3x is frequent.

Let\u2019s call her Sam. Sam has been with us for almost a full year, and we\u2019ve been taking care of her. We also have two small children (3 &1) who live in our home as well. \n\nWe occasionally ask Sam to watch the kids for us when we have errands to run or want a date night etc. She graduated high school in May, and did not have a job over the summer nor paid any sort of bills, so we didn\u2019t think it was a huge ask considering we pay everything. Cellphone, shoes, clothes, anything she needs.\n\nWe just finally trusted Sam enough to watch the kids over night so we could go out of town to celebrate our anniversary. Everything went fine and we returned home with no issues. Or so we thought. \n\nToday, I had some errands to run while husband went to work, so I asked Sam to watch the kids for about 2 hours last evening. Sam is in no way a morning, and it\u2019s VERY apparent. For reference this is at 7:12 am. The kids had just gotten up at 6:30.\n\nThis morning when she got up to watch the kids, she instantly fell asleep back on the couch. Husband and I had to wake her up before we left. We have a car in the shop currently so I was dropping him off then doing my errands. I had to use the restroom after dropping him off so I stopped back home, to find my house door unlocked and the home alarm not turned on. Sam was in the room with the kids sleeping. This was at 7:50 am. She had no idea I ever entered the house. I was angry but got back into my car to go do what I needed to do. \n\nWhile I was driving, I had a nagging feeling to check the living room camera from after the time we left. What I see on the camera horrified me as a mom. Not even 10 minutes after we left, Sam goes to the spot we keep the children\u2019s melatonin (my child is autistic and takes it nightly) and proceeds to plop one into my child\u2019s mouth. \n\nI saw red I sent the video to my husband to confirm what I saw, and he agreed. I then also sent it to my mom to triple check. I fly home and go inside to confront her. She lies and lies to me until she tells me that she actually did do it. \n\nI told her that she needed to be out of my house today by 1pm. And she had a total meltdown. She gave me every reason in the book as to why she did it, and freaked out that she has no where to go. \n\nI told a few people because I\u2019m so upset I\u2019m crying. I had some people who agreed with me, but some saying I shouldn\u2019t kick her out since she has no where to go. Making me feel horrible. \n\nSo my question to you is; AITA for kicking her out over giving my child melatonin?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Just because it helps with sleeping and your sleep cycle doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. You can\u2019t just give a child (a goddamn toddler) more than the recommended dose, which is what she was doing. The effects could have been serious!\n\nAlso, she did this for selfish reasons. She just wanted to go back to sleep. She didn\u2019t care for their well-being, about their needs, she just wanted sleep, which is ultimately a big issue.\n\nIf my understanding is correct. She got up to babysit and fell asleep. You woke her up when you left to drop your husband off, came back to her sleeping again. You left, to when she woke up, and that\u2019s when the incident occurred, right?  Because if so, that\u2019s shitty of her.

Wasn't safe at home, a couple from church took them in but weren't clear on expectations/responsibilities and they basically ended up being a free nanny while trying to finish high school, had to sleep on the couch, and was sexually abused by the dad (a bishop in the church). They never felt able to speak up because they had nowhere to go and just needed to make it to college and get out. \n\nIF you move a teen into your home you need to be super clear on what you are offering them and what you expect from them in return. And you should NOT expect that they automatically know the right way to care for children or rules you haven't made clear. Teens don't move into unrelated adult's houses because their lives have been easy. I am sure Sam is dealing with trauma and may not always make the best decisions. She may also not make the best decisions because she is 18! I know when I was a teen I didn't fully understand why giving a kid Benadryl to make them sleep was bad (I never did when babysitting this but we knew someone who did and my mom was horrified and I was like \"what's the big deal, its harmless!\").

For example, for our trip we we asked my MIL to come watch the kids, and Sam told us that\u2019d she do it, so MIL didn\u2019t have to travel 4 hours to come watch the kids.\n\nYou have a point that Sam's position is somewhat precarious, but none of us are owed free room and board. She should be working or doing all that she can to contribute to the household that is providing her with everything she needs and more.\n\nETA: Also, explicit instructions or not, Sam was so far in the wrong to drug OP's child back to sleep in the morning once they were already up and out of bed.

There's pressure \n- Ask her to tidy after herself? She's gonna feel that or else her living situation depends on it\n- Ask her to do some household errands? Better get it right, or else you're out\n- Ask her to do chores?\n\nLiterally what you're describing is a situation where an 18 is ENTITLED to live with someone pressure free and not obligated to pay rent, bc if the 18 yo doesn't pay rent she's out on her feet. Hm sounds like power dynamics play a role in landlord and tenant relationships.\n\n@OP first mistake was being charitable, their second mistake was posting it here so people can accuse them of taking advantage and pressuring and parentifying an adult who consented to babysitting, who pays nothing to live there, and fed the child drugs to accomodate their sleep schedule.\n\nI can agree there's pressure to feel you need to contribute, that shouldn't be unexpected or criticized. I'm at work, I feel pressure to do my job well or else I'll lose it. I feel pressure to make sure I'm adhering to all rules in the presence of authority. It didn't matter if the friend was 18 or 58, that power dynamic of being economically dependent will always exist. We don't chide SAHParents when their partner is economically dependent on someone else and sure you can argue it's a familial relationship that's fair, but who is anyone to criticize an 18 yo who accepts free lodging they need at risk of babysitting a few hours a week and a couple who asks for reasonable things. It's not like the friend is being put on blast for feeding the child too much, or keeping them up late watching movies, it's a highly negligible thing to feed a child drugs unwarranted and if you think the friend is too immature to warrant such a task, then I have news for you about being 18 and homeless, it's expected unless you have parents that will take care of you, that you provide yourself your own job, funds to live and feed yourself. \n\nIt seems like a reasonable scenario and the analysis' being pulled from it are so hyper critical.", "I think it\u2019s more ESH.

My point to using the word DRUGGED is based on the fact that this person gave a child a medication that altered the brain function (may have been just sleep, but the point remains) for her own needs, not the child's. And, as I have stated already, it is very easy to mess up a child's sleep pattern, especially one with autism. Since he had barely been awake, then given melatonin to make him sleep even longer, that prolonged amount of sleep could have made it hard for him to keep his usual sleep child. And a grumpy child in general is no fun, but a grumpy autistic child can be very much a handful.", "19 is old enough to be able to take responsibility when you realize you've bitten off too much to chew and ask for help rather than trying to essentially drug the child into sleeping.

Considering the power imbalance as well, and how OP openly expressed she didn\u2019t think it was a \u201cbig deal,\u201d you aren\u2019t really giving the girl many options. That level of care should be provided by someone much more responsible or at least experienced in child care. \n\n2) Look up Au pairs, it\u2019s incredibly normal to stay with the family and be *paid* for child care provided. They require their own bedroom and three meals a day *on top* of that, as well as two weeks of paid vacation. \n\nOP clearly has a savior complex but is taking advantage of a girl with no other options, who was overwhelmed and clearly didn\u2019t think her actions were that out of pocket.

You don\u2019t know how much the kid might have already taken or how recently, it could screw up the kid and the whole family\u2019s sleep cycle for days. \n\nShe did it out of malice, laziness, or a complete disregard for the children\u2019s care.

I also don't feel like it's that fucked up to give a melatonin gummy to a child who gets it regularly anyways. The chances of the kid falling asleep from it is pretty unlikely, especially after the child JUST woke up. Melatonin doesn't make you fall asleep, it's purpose is to relax and aid you in falling asleep. The kid probably just got a little drowsy.
