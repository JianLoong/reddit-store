We are not very close as we go to different universities, but we were on good terms. My roommate is on the chubbier side and talks about how she\u2019s body positive a lot, which I don\u2019t have an issue with. We also go to the gym together sometimes and are very regular with our gym schedules. My issue with her is that a lot of times when I'm doing something that has to do with my own self-improvement, she tends to leave comments on that. things like one time I was eating a salad for breakfast while she was eating a sandwich, and she gave me a dirty look and left. Or making comments on my exercise or yoga routine and saying stuff like \"you\u2019re exercising too much\" or \u201cyou don\u2019t need to do all this\u201d. I know it\u2019s stupid, but all of this I've come to ignore because I didn\u2019t want to cause problems with her. \n\nA few days ago, I got an Apple Watch as a birthday present and have been using it to count my steps and see how many calories I've burned in a day. To complete my step goals in a day, I tend to take the staircase (we live on the 5th floor) instead of the elevator. She saw me take the stairs one day and said that I was trying to \u2018one up her', and I was baffled because I had no idea what she was trying to say. This comment of hers made me feel uneasy as I'd not done anything to her (to my knowledge), and the next day, I asked her what she was trying to say, and she said that I'm always trying to prove that I'm better than her because she\u2019s fat (her words, not mine) by eating salads for breakfast and taking the stairs instead of just using the elevator, and proceeded to finish by saying \"We get it, you're thin\". I was standing there shocked because I had never done anything targeted at her and was just trying to stay healthy.\n\nI stood there quietly for a few seconds and told her that I genuinely apologise to her if I've made her feel this way, but I did tell her that I feel that she\u2019s projecting her issues onto me because I've not done anything for her to feel this way and have just been trying to stay healthy. She teared up, called me an asshole, and left angrily. Later that day, I got a text from her friend (21 f) on Instagram telling me that I was rude to my roommate and that I should apologise to her. I admit I could\u2019ve worded my sentence in a better way, and I am ready to apologise for that, but I won\u2019t be apologising for eating salads, or taking the stairs because that\u2019s just ridiculous.\n\n I have apologised to my roommate for the comment, and she has apologised to me for calling me an asshole, and she\u2019s also been giving me the cold shoulder since then. But i still feel weird about this and needed a third person pov, so AITA?\n\np.s: our lease finishes in two months so i\u2019ve already started looking for new places to stay because i don\u2019t want to live with her anymore \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "created_utc": 1693497300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166exrq/aita_for_telling_roommate_shes_projecting_her/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
