That is long. If men can handle seeing women with mini skirts far shorter or bikinis for that matter, then can also deal with a long shirt.", "Yes and as I open the very first one I can see that it is literally sewn in at the waist.  UNLIKE a tee shirt. \n\nThe third one comes down to the woman's calves.  LOL. \n\nThe fourth is literally. LITERALLY pulled in at the waist and looks nothing like a t shirt.  \n\nIn the last link the item description says to pair it with pants or leggings.  LOL. \n\n\nIf you really cannot see the difference between a tee shirt and the dresses you linked...You're either lost or being insincere. \n\nAnd no it's really not hard.  Thanks for making my point for me.  LOL.\n\nETA: did you even look at what you linked?", "The shirt is extremely baggy and I'd have to see how OP defines almost reaching her knees.  \n\nIt's not what men can and cannot handle.  It's whether or not it's far enough from normal to be distracting.  \n\nI can handle seeing a guy at work in a viking helmet.  But it'll be distracting and it has nothing to do with sex.", "Total of six. First six from a search. Didn\u2019t filter out any to fit my point. Just the first six. Four of which show you you\u2019re just utterly wrong, *but* you choose to point out the only two that support your opinion, yet I\u2019m the one being insincere...ok bud."]}
