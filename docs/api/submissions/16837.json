I was at home, wearing shorts my size, but a 3XL shirt, so the shirt was larger than the shorts, making me look as if I was ONLY wearing an oversized shirt. I was minding my own business, checking our shelves and fridge to see what we need so I can order groceries online, when my roommate came to me and asked me if I could please change either my shirt or my short because I was distracting her boyfriend.

So she asked me if I could please put on either larger shorts or a shorter shirt that doesn't cover the shorts, so her BF stop staring at me. \n\nI thought she was being ridiculous, so I told her I will not change so if it makes her uncomfortable just tell her BF to stop staring at me. \n\nShe is now mad at me and is not speaking to me and is really awkward to share home with someone that is not speaking to me, so I'm wondering if I was an AH.

You should absolutely not have to change your clothes in your own home! More fool him for admitting to his girlfriend that you were distracting him! I\u2019d be more concerned with telling her to RUN! If a man thinks it\u2019s ok to objectify a woman and openly sexualise someone in front of her what on earth is he doing behind her back!  Gross!", "NTA\n\nIf your shirt is long enough to cover shorts, throw on a belt and call it a \"shirtdress.\"  Even if you didn't have shorts, it would have been long enough to be decent.", "NTA - Her boyfriend was the one imagining what you did or didn\u2019t have on under your shirt. He was sexualizing you, and contrary to roommate\u2019s popular but ignorant beliefs, what women wear actually has very little to do with men hellbent on sexualizing them.\n\nRoommate has a boyfriend problem and she\u2019s grossly misdirecting her anger.", "NTA.  If the shirt was long enough to cover the shorts, there clearly wasn't any sort of inappropriate exposure.  This is like demanding you change out of a dress.  Your roommate needs to direct this anger at her skeevy bf, not you.", "Nta. You were wearing shorts, even if they arent immediately visible. And it's your home, you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in.\n\nPS congrats on your weightloss journey!", "NTA.  Your roommate has the issue not you.", "NTA, and i'm struggling to find what's offensive or distracting about wearing a shirt that's longer than the shorts that are covering your ass... it just means even *more* of your legs are covered than they would be if you were wearing a shorter shirt...", "NTA. First of all, congratulations on your weight loss!\n\nThe problem here is not you, it is the BF. He is the one who needs to learn not to stare or be distracted. His problems are not your responsibility.", "NTA. You don't have a clothing problem. You have a roommate problem. Her BF should keep his eyes in his head and act like a grownup.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, congrats on achieving your goals so far ! Wishing you luck with the last little bit.\n\nYou were dressed perfectly fine. If her boyfriend can't stop his eyes from wandering, that sounds like a him issue.", "NTA, your roommate has issues, and her boyfriend is disgusting", "NTA - He can\u2019t control himself so his insecure girlfriend is trying to control you. You can wear whatever you like in your own home, if an oversized shirt is that distracting tell them to go outside and touch grass.", "NTA\n\nShe has a BF problem.", "NTA- you are not responsible for a grown man's behavior", "NTA at all!! Your roommate is being WILDLY inappropriate, as is her boyfriend. And everyone telling you change up your outfit is missing the point! The point is that you can absolutely wear WHATEVER you want to (within reason, so long as your bathing suit parts are covered lol) because it\u2019s YOUR apartment!!! Strangers shouldn\u2019t be sexualizing you in your apartment. That\u2019s your safe place. If he can\u2019t handle being around you, he needs to stop coming by YOUR apartment.", "NTA - your roommate's boyfriend is the asshole here. He shouldn't be sexualizing you to the extent that you become \"distracting\" to him. He shouldn't be staring at you. He's a gross perv.\n\n\nSidenote: if both the shirt and shorts are acceptable independently how the fuck are they not when combined???", "NTA. Reality is on your side. You were fully dressed. Any problem is in his head.\n\nHowever, that isn't a good look. Try tying the t-shirt in a knot at one of your hips. That used to be a fashionable thing to do. I can't remember when, but it was.", "NTA. 1. It\u2019s your home and even if you were wearing a bikini, that\u2019s your business. 2. Sounds like your roommate has a pervert boyfriend problem. He needs to stop ogling women in front of his girlfriend. Tell your roommate it\u2019s a shirt dress because it technically is! If he can\u2019t stand a woman in a dress, then he needs to seriously sort out his priorities. What a creep! Sorry you\u2019re having to deal with that.", "NTA this sounds like a bf issue not a you issue", "NTA. Simple... creepy boyfriend banned.

Secondly - Your room mate must be very insecure as you have done nothing at all wrong.", "NTA it\u2019s not your fault her bf is a creep. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. You can and should wear whatever you like in your own home. \n\nBut\u2026 I realize you are on a weight loss journey and you haven\u2019t reached your goal yet, but you really should buy some clothes for the current size you are at. You will feel so good! Go to a thrift store and buy a couple of tops!! \n\nI\u2019ve lost 90 pounds so far and I find so much joy being able to fit into a size large shirt instead of the 3XL that I started out in. And I will feel equally happy when I get to a medium or a small. Celebrate ALL your victories!

FYI on clothes, check out charity thrift shops.  There are some really nice clothes there.  Just wondering what your roommate's weight is like?", "NTA.  You are wearing shorts.  That's all your roommate needs to know.", "Or you know tuck it in so the shorts are visible but I mean that just seems so hard to do.

Your roommate\u2019s insecurities are not your problem, and she cannot control your sartorial choices.

Have fun shopping!!", "Because then the looker is not plagued by impure thoughts!/s", "Because it does give the illusion that someone isn't wearing pants and I'm used to seeing people wearing pants or some sort of bottom.", "How is it any different from wearing a dress?", "Because tee shirts aren't dresses.  Even a tee shirt dress doesn't just look like a t-shirt it looks more like a dress.  Or it has a belt to make it clear that the bottom part is meant to mimic a dress."]}
