I'm assuming you know how to peel an orange and eat it without making a massive mess. Why the heck is she worried about your orange juice spraying her in the mouth? That's weird.\n\nIts a high school cafeteria table - you are not the only one who has eaten oranges on that table that day. I'd get it if it was a peanut oil allergy but this one is weird.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She, indeed, could have gone to another table.", "NTA\n\nHer allergies are exactly that: HER issues. It's up to her to remove herself from areas where her allergies could become an issue, not the other way around. She could have easily asked to switch seats with someone so she wasn't directly across from you; she could have switched tables; or she could have just excused herself and left the area altogether. (Which, ultimately, is what she ended up doing anyway.)\n\nWe have no obligation to ensure those with allergies are accommodated. Sometimes, we make exceptions, but that's a choice we make, not one we should be forced to do. \n\nIMO, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. If she was uncomfortable sitting at your table while you were eating an orange, then she should have politely excused herself from the table. You were just following your usual routine and shouldn't have to forego your lunch for her benefit. She was rude to ask you to put your orange away after you had already started eating it.", "NTA What does she expect? The world to revolve around her? She needs to grow and realize it doesn't. If she's that allergic then SHE needs to move. Enjoy your oranges.", "NTA.", "NTA, she has the right to get up and walk away, not tell you what you can and can\u2019t eat.", "NTA - imagine if we had to cut out foods from our diet to suit everyone who can see us, there\u2019d be nothing left to eat!", "NTA\n\nIf any of the juice accidentally got in her mouth?  WTF?  That doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nShe is the one who is new to the table, and she is the one who has the allergy, so she is the one to move.", "NTA. Dude. I had a friend in high school that was allergic to oranges too. I'd sometimes eat my orange like an apple to get laughs out of my other friends, or I'd eat it normally. Regardless, the friend always sat a few chairs down from me, even when we were crammed, 10 in one booth, 2 in the other (we were all touch starved kids). He took advantage of the fact that there were numerous other solutions. This girl could have too.", "NTA.  She has to learn to manage her allergies and not to depend on others to capitulate to what she needs.", "NTA, if she has allergies then it's her responsibility to take measures to avoid exposure, she could've done this quite easily by just moving to another table with no oranges.", "Any of the juice gets in her mouth? Does she think you're going to regurgitate it and spit it into her mouth?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\n>if any of the orange juices accidentally went in her mouth she would have a reaction. \n\nThis is just fucking absurd. Orange juice doesn't just magically splash into people's mouths. Now, if it had been one of those crazy, \"I can't even withstand citrus fumes\" allergies, she'd have a point, but she's just being fussy.", ">she said she was allergic and if any of the orange juices accidentally went in her mouth she would have a reaction.\n\nWell that's pretty ridiculous. Everyone doesn't have to avoid her when eating an orange, especially when only a unrealistic scenario is what she's would cause her to have a reaction. Tell her to sit somewhere else if she's so afraid.  \n\nNTA", "NTA- It seems like it\u2019s only an allergy to ingesting orange as the only way for a reaction is for the juice to go into her mouth which is unlikely in itself. If she was that allergic she\u2019d carry an epi pen or just move away as your eating the orange then maybe come back if the table had been wiped", "NTA, the smell wasn't hurting her and you didn't force feed her. Its a her problem, not a you problem", "NTA... i can understand the lack of apeel from her.. but orange ya gonna stand your ground on this one?", "Even if it was a peanut allergy, it's not up to OP to ensure this girl doesn't come into contact with peanuts.", "I\u2019m allergic to bees and wasps I don\u2019t just suddenly never go out in the summer to avoid all bees, if your the type to let your allergies control your life your gonna be avoiding so many stupid scenarios. Might also be a case of parents putting that fear into her head, my mum goes wild when I\u2019m near bees.", "Do\u2026do you not do that with your friends? Am I the weird one for baby birding snacks?", "In fairness, oranges do tend to squirt when you try to peel them or separate their segments. I don't think it's likely to go specifically into someone's mouth, but it's not as if there's no mechanism by which it could.", "Maybe parents are putting fear into her.  Sorry about your allergies - I have a friend who has the same thing and it can be life-threatening.  Hope you stay bite-free!!", "Mines life threatening as well but it\u2019s not too bad to avoid, I usually just ask the nearest person to take them out the room. I do need to get a test tho because I haven\u2019t been stung since i was a kid and I don\u2019t have an epi pen"]}
