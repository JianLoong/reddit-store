I'm assuming you know how to peel an orange and eat it without making a massive mess. Why the heck is she worried about your orange juice spraying her in the mouth? That's weird.\n\nIts a high school cafeteria table - you are not the only one who has eaten oranges on that table that day. I'd get it if it was a peanut oil allergy but this one is weird.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She, indeed, could have gone to another table.", "NTA\n\nHer allergies are exactly that: HER issues. It's up to her to remove herself from areas where her allergies could become an issue, not the other way around. She could have easily asked to switch seats with someone so she wasn't directly across from you; she could have switched tables; or she could have just excused herself and left the area altogether. (Which, ultimately, is what she ended up doing anyway.)\n\nWe have no obligation to ensure those with allergies are accommodated. Sometimes, we make exceptions, but that's a choice we make, not one we should be forced to do. \n\nIMO, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. If she was uncomfortable sitting at your table while you were eating an orange, then she should have politely excused herself from the table. You were just following your usual routine and shouldn't have to forego your lunch for her benefit. She was rude to ask you to put your orange away after you had already started eating it.", "NTA What does she expect? The world to revolve around her? She needs to grow and realize it doesn't. If she's that allergic then SHE needs to move.

I had a friend in high school that was allergic to oranges too. I'd sometimes eat my orange like an apple to get laughs out of my other friends, or I'd eat it normally. Regardless, the friend always sat a few chairs down from me, even when we were crammed, 10 in one booth, 2 in the other (we were all touch starved kids). He took advantage of the fact that there were numerous other solutions. This girl could have too.", "NTA.

Tell her to sit somewhere else if she's so afraid.  \n\nNTA", "NTA- It seems like it\u2019s only an allergy to ingesting orange as the only way for a reaction is for the juice to go into her mouth which is unlikely in itself.

Am I the weird one for baby birding snacks?", "In fairness, oranges do tend to squirt when you try to peel them or separate their segments.

You don\u2019t have to be considerate if you don\u2019t want to.", "To be clear, NTA.  Person eating did nothing wrong. And I do think it\u2019s up to the allergic person to move away.

If the situation were truly dangerous to them, they should get up and leave immediately.\n\nThat said, I have a colleague who is allergic to oranges.  If she walks into a room where an orange is being peeled, it\u2019s enough to cause a reaction.  It\u2019s because the act of peeling aerosolizes the allergen.  We do not eat oranges in the staff room.  I honestly don\u2019t know how she survived high school.

I seem to be a tad more tolerant now but I don\u2019t risk it anyway.", "My skin itches and my throat gets puffy with citrus. But that's eating it. The only reason I wouldn't want someone eating an orange near me is cause I'm jealous, oranges used to be my favorite fruit (allergy developed in my 30s). But I'm not worried about dying cause someone has an orange around me. That girl was something else", "No but I do think peanuts can be more complex. \n\nMy son has a peanut allergy and has always excused himself from the table if someone broke out peanut butter. It was on him to move but it did make the table unsafe for him to sit there and he also had to be very careful of contact with the peanut butter eater. Peanut butter residue can be hard to get rid of and a kid who ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and wipes his hands on his pants can transfer that to another surface. That was how my son had an anaphylactic reaction in 1st grade. He's also had reactions due to cross contamination. \n\nI am not saying that means my son prevents people from eating peanuts or peanut butter around him. He knows it is on him to stay safe but a peanut allergy can be more of a challenge to navigate in social situations.", "My school used to sell crisps made by kp who are famous for making nuts and certain items that may contain nuts were banned due to a kid having an allergy but still they sold kp Crisps", "NTA, if she has allergies then it's her responsibility to take measures to avoid exposure,", "She didn\u2019t make the request until after it was peeled, though!", " She\u2019s concerned about the orange juice accidentally getting in her mouth.", "Orange juices aerosolise when peeled (source, have an orange allergy).\n\nThat said - if she is able to move then I don\u2019t see why not.\n\nI move, if necessary.\n\nThe only exception is at home and at work, where it\u2019s not reasonable for me to be unable to access a space I need to be in.", "NTA, I thought I was the only one in this world with an orange allergy. If you waited until the end of the meal, she could have easily excused herself. I would have done the same, and my allergy is so severe that if I even smell an orange for more than a couple of minutes then I'll have a bad reaction. I once got really sick and had trouble breathing because a colleague was eating an orange in her office (next to mine).

This is *allergy signalling.*\n\nYou're not smashing the orange with your fist here.\n\nAnd like others said, if she could get \"orange juice vapor anaphylaxis\", that's another matter.

Does she demand the oranges at the store be removed too?", "NTA\n\nThe setting is important. This is a high school cafeteria. The expectation is that oranges are present. I own my allergies, and others have the same responsibility.", "Hi all, I\u2019m actually allergic to oranges too. The orange oil is the the worst.

Actually, yes there is risk for some juices to splash and that would be bad. But the way she explained it was not very clear. \nShe may need to learn how to explain her allergies. And OP needs to learn some empathy, and accept that hopefully this girl would never talk to him again", "When you peel the rind, orange oil is released and sprays quite far. I\u2019m sure that is what she was referring to. Had a bus driver that would have an allergic relaxation to oranges even if it was someone in the back seat eating one. \n\nOp is NTA. She should have moved seats.

My mom has a severe citrus allergy and can't be in the same room as a peeled orange.

He graduates high school this year and will be attending college out of state this fall. I am part of a parenting group for teens and young adults with allergies and I am stressing a lot less than others. Some of the parents never really prepared their kids for dealing with their allergies. They sent them to nut free schools and were always around in case anything happened. My kid knew from kindergarten how to look out for his allergens and what to do if he accidentally consumes them.

Was she planning to kiss you, maybe? Normally, I'd say that yes, you were the AH because you continued to eat something around someone who has told you they're allergic--if she hadn't been sitting with you before, how was she to know what your habits are, and no matter how long you've been doing something, it doesn't outweigh the risk of severe allergic reaction or death. But her saying she'd have a reaction \"if any of the orange juices accidentally went into her mouth\" makes me wonder if she just doesn't like oranges (and if it's just oranges, or citrus in general?).

Said person continues to eat their lunch to include their orange and you think you have the right to tell them not to finish their lunch as opposed to simply moving to another table on the other side of the cafeteria?", "That\u2019s when you are peeling it, not someone else on the table. And they have to get it in their mouth, they didn\u2019t mention their hands.", "Nope", "I loved seafood in my younger years.  I started developing allergies to it in my mid-30s.  Also, apparently, certain balsam oils, which make me break out in hives and well up like a balloon.  Anaphylactic shock is no joke.   I am also diagnosed celiac.  But my allergies and issues are mine to deal with.  It's not so hard to just remove oneself from the situation to avoid the allergen.  \n\nOne of my pet peeves as well as other sufferers, especially when it comes to the celiac and the fish, is the people who think they \"know better\".  I was at an event and had an acquaintance swear she made gluten-free items for me, only to spend several days in agony because they most certainly were NOT gluten-free.  So I just don't eat anything that I don't make myself or \\*know\\* is gluten-free (unprocessed meats, grilled veggies, fresh fruit).", "I work with someone highly allergic to nuts and we can't bring anything to the office that could harm them.. I'm happy to change my snacks to keep my colleague alive...\nI  think my colleague either have empathy or  just don't want anyone going to the hospital because of them.\nAs for my friends. Sometimes they suggest a place I know I can't go and I skip that one. And then I chose the next one. Or if someone is cooking something I can't eat they are ok with me bringing something else. It's called being a friend. \n\nBut as I said before, there are better ways to explain things to people and the girl with the allergy could have said it better. Maybe she even needs to understand her condition better\n\nBut people with allergies still deserve to live and to be at school and not being afraid of people thinking they're crazy or entitled.\nI can assure you that they would prefer not to have a shitty allergy", "My sister was the first in our district to have deadly nut allergies. She had an ambulance take her to the hospital two times in one week when she was in elementary school. By middle school she was homebound due to stress migraines because of how fearful she was of being exposed because the district decided they couldn't/wouldn't ban foods because it essentially \"wasn't fair\" to other kids. She ended up getting her GED at 16 because she was never able to return back to school full time.", "That's very true. \n\nIt still doesn't change the fact that it's up to the person with the allergy to make sure they are not putting themselves in a situation where they are certain things. It's not up to other people to ensure the safety of this person.", "personally I would have moved! that is definitely usually best! but \u201cthis girl who never sits with us sat with us and didnt talk the whole time\u201d sounds like missing story to me! and big chunks of missing story\u2026 usually means OP is TA.", "personally I\u2019d\u2019ve moved! but there is a LOT missing from OP\u2019s story.", "I wouldn\u2019t say most.

Elementary school they were but I think even in middle school they could have peanut butter sandwiches.", "I also had a coworker with a citrus allergy, but to make matters worse, she had no sense of smell (lost it after a head injury). So she sometimes didn\u2019t see the citrus until she was right up on it, which was no bueno.", ">but \u201cthis girl who never sits with us sat with us and didnt talk the whole time\u201d sounds like missing story to me! and big chunks of missing story\u2026 usually means OP is TA.\n\nOr, you know, she sat there because there were no other seats left. Maybe she was late to the cafeteria. Maybe her friends were busy. Maybe her usual spot was taken. \n\nIt's not that complicated and it's in bad faith to call OP an asshole over that.", "That is definitely possible.

When I was stung as a kid my arm/leg would blow right up and I would struggle to breath aka start going into anaphylactic shock. This is all in my medical record so I don\u2019t know why they need to check?", "Do you mean Central America?", "I\u2019m in MA, bluest of the blue states, and my school only has a nut-free/allergy table in the cafeteria. The kids are allowed to bring anything they want from home.", "I wonder if there aren't any kids actively attending with allergies? Or airborne severity? With a kid like that it's REALLY hard to regulate so they usually have to have an all or nothing policy.", "Same here. A different true blue state and we have a nut free table", "Also a blue state. Nut-free table as well, and occasionally the principal's office if it was Uncrustables day.", "The number of children with the allergy are going down because the guidance about allergen exposure has been updated. So many of the kids going to school now have been exposed from the age of 6 months to all major allergens and therefore have fewer allergies and less severe ones.\n\nIt turned out that avoiding giving your children allergens actually increased the number and severity of allergies.\n\n\nAll this said I have a food allergy that I've had my entire life despite being exposed so I am aware of the complications and struggle when you do have an allergy.", "Unfortunately for my sister that didn't work! She was regularly consuming nuts and then the allergy started. She was about 3 when it started and she's 34 now and they're still deadly. But she's allergic to more things than not: all nuts, legumes/beans, a bunch of fruits & veg, and some fish.", "As a food allergy sufferer... I'm on the fence because you really don't understand if you don't have a food allergy.  Many people I know with citrus allergies have adverse reactions to just being around an orange when it is peeled and eaten.  It may be she has a reaction but only has full anaphylaxis when ingesting it and doesn't know how to explain that.  That said before meeting someone who had a citrus allergy I never realized how much eating an orange really does spray.  So please keep that in mind for the future.\n\nIf you had said she was still eating while you consumed the orange I would definitely have a different answer for you.  However it seems like you were at the end of your lunch period and she was not still eating.  In which case the argument was uncalled for and she could have easily excused herself from the table.  Going to the bathroom may very well have been self protection, to ensure she didn't have any droplets on her, or even possibly she felt a reaction to the orange coming on.  \n\nNTA. But you should be aware that some allergies are multifaceted and not everyone knows how to communicate this.", "I know someone who is very allergic to grapefruit and can't around when grapefruit is peeled because of the stuff that gets released into the air when you peel the grapfruit.", "It would have been so easy to be nice about this, but you chose not to be. People with serious food allergies have to be on guard all the time. It's a scary way to live. So yeah, you sound like a jerk and YTA.", "No. I have a pepper allergy. I am responsible for ensuring that I don't eat peppers or come into contact with them (sometimes breathing them trips my allergies.)

It\u2019s an entire cafeteria and you were there first.  It was up to her to move.", "i\u2019m allergic to oranges also and i literally have always moved myself away because that\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.

Because it's responsible and I'm part of a community in which I don't want others to go to the hospital.  \n\nYou're certainly within your rights to be a jerk about it, you're not an AH per se, but we all adjust our lives to be better community members and in the future you could consider that.", "Guess the safest thing for that person is to keep their mouth tightly shut so no juices get in.", "NTA.

NTA", "I agree and this OP is NTA but I also know someone with an orange allergy and even the juice that kinda aerosolizes when you peel it is enough to set her off. \n\nHowever, you still have to be pretty close for that to be an issue.

Or at least they did 15 years ago at my high school. The art teacher let students with nut allergies eat in her room so that we could be assured a safe space. \n\nI for one, am super glad I outgrew my childhood nut allergy. Peanutbutter is tasty.", "Right.

Some schools don\u2019t even allow latex gloves. That not the point of the what I was saying.  Nut allergies can be air born that\u2019s why schools ban nut products from being allowed in the school.

To a point, it is up to schools to make adjustments for their students.

The cost of medications in this country is a completely separate argument and it's not the responsibility of anyone other than those who have to pay for them", "just say you dont like peanut butter and move on man", "Thank you for answering. That is very interesting! I wonder if anyone checked what that's about. Peanut allergies can be very dangerous, but I never saw a lot of research on why peanuts specifically are so dangerous to a lot of people", "I know but I'm asking why. What is it about peanuts that even opening a jar can be bad for someone? Peanut allergy is one of the only allergies I have heard about that is airborne in a lot of cases.
