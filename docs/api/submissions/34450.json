Its confusing to me that you both could be spending thousands of dollars without some kind of agreement over who was responsible for what. From the sound of it, if you both lived in the apartment then it should be an equal split. But who paid for the ongoing rent? Bills? Food? You say you were a financial burden? What does that mean? If your sister payed for all these other things then she might feel that you do owe her \u00a33000? Idk. Seems like a weird situation", "ESH- so can we clarify by \u201cbought\u201d you mean \u201crented?\u201d \n\nYes you only should pay her back for the portion she spotted you, if you two had agreed you\u2019d split everything totally down the middle to begin with. Are you paying equal rent? If so she\u2019s crazy for demanding the full 3000, and threatening to sue you is extreme. I\u2019m NAL but I don\u2019t believe her argument would hold up in court, and if she\u2019s that broke good luck to her affording a lawyer. \n\nYoure TA for agreeing to move into a plsce you couldn\u2019t afford in the first place, and not paying her back what you owed as quickly as you could. And now for telling her you\u2019d pay the whole thing. Just pay her the 750 and you\u2019re even", "Has your sister always been bad at math?\n\nIt\u2019s simple\u2014the move in cost for the apartment was $4500, which divided in two should have been $2250 each. She paid $3000 (an extra $750), and you paid $1500 ($750 less than half). You owe her $750, which would make it so each of you paid $2250.", "NTA. You owe her $750.", "Info:\nWhat kind of apartment you can buy for 4500$?", "info: the apartment is on your name and/or your sister name ?", "YTA for not already paying her the remainder of your half. \n\nLife is not a Judge Judy episode. She helped you and covered costs last year. \n\nThis is not about the deposit. This is about you not paying her back and your miserly attitude when she is in difficulty. \n\nHas she moved out? Then no? You don\u2019t owe her the full amount. You owe her half.", "YTA for moving in with a psycho chick, she's your sister, you should have seen this coming. \n\nAs for suing, since the amount is less than $10,000 she can sue you in small claims court. However, she would need to win the case, which anyone who passed 3rd grade math knows you owe $750 not $3000. Even if she got a ruling for $3000 she needs to enforce collection which is a whole other nightmare. Honestly, I think most jurisdictions you can just claim you are BK and the entire case is a waste of the courts time.", "It sounds likes you made an agreement. Unless this so called verbal agreement was manipulated and were in a good headspace. You should fess up. She held you in a finical burden and then you want to f her off.

I mean COME ON.", "If you still live there give her the $750. That means you've each paid half of the up front costs. But font give her the full $3000, that would be you paying the entire first, last and deposit which isn't fair when you're both living there and rented it together", "Why did you have to put down 4 months of rent for security?", "Her math is wrong - you only owe her $750 but ESH for failure to communicate.", "ESH you owe her the 750 which you know so", "NTA she should've asked for 750 bucks in order to break even", "NTA\n\nYou're correct, the most you mind that owe her is $725, resulting in both of you splitting any return of the security deposit.  Alternatively, you could pay her nothing and she gets the entire security deposit when the two of you move be out.", "We split the rent evenly every month, we both pay $750 each, not including the gas or electric but we go half and half on that as well. The only reason she put down $3000 on the apartment and I only put down $1500 was because that was all I had in my bank at the time, and she was very eager to get out of our mother\u2019s house due to the living situation over there!!! Now she\u2019s telling me I should pay her back $3000 all because she had to put down more than me and it took a toll on her financially, which I think is very freaking unfair!! I OWE her $750 (the other half I couldn\u2019t afford). It\u2019s not my responsibility or my fault that she\u2019s broke. She was the one who did all the communicating with the landlord, not me!! She could\u2019ve told the landlord that she wanted to pass up on the offer and keep looking!! But NO. Now this falls on me somehow ??", "Unless she isn\u2019t living there and it\u2019s just OP. Some people use other people info to be able to get into apartments.", "They\u2019re renting. It was the security deposit.", "We signed a lease, it\u2019s under both of our names im pretty sure.", "First of all, I\u2019ve already been paying her back in small increments for what I owe her.  I think it\u2019s a little ridiculous that she thinks I should owe her $3000 though!! $750 is what I owe her and so far I\u2019ve given her $60 so now it\u2019s at $690. And no she hasn\u2019t moved out, we are still living together .", "Yes, I agreed to it to get her off my back!! but if I\u2019m paying her $3000, that means she paid nothing! Tell me how this makes sense to you? I don\u2019t technically \u201cowe\u201d her $3000, that\u2019s just what she wants. I owe her $750 and I\u2019ve been paying her back in small increments, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve just told her to F off and that I\u2019m not paying her .", "She can't win. You signed a lease and are each responsible for half. Paying her the remainder of your half of the original $4500 brings you even.", "They didn\u2019t, their rent is 1500/month. So upfront they had to pay 1500 for first months rent, 1500 for last months rent, and 1500 security deposit, totaling 4500", "Your splitting 50/50,  so your right.  At most you owe her \u00a3750,  but then you would get 50% of the security deposit back.  Definitely don't pay her for anything more", "Probably NTA then. But you still should have had this worked out before going into it", "OP said they bought it", "ok, thx.\n\nNTA, I think you just owe her 750, not 3000.", "\u201cSmall increments\u201d since last February and that only totals $60?? Have you been paying her like $3 at a time? It\u2019s been almost a year, you guys should have figured out a payment plan as soon as she leant you the money. You do not owe her the full $3000, but you should have definitely paid her back by now", "You\u2019ve paid her $60 over the past year. If that\u2019s not an F you to someone who helped you idk what is. I can see why she\u2019s at the end of the rope and desperate for that cash since you\u2019ve clearly been taking advantage of her.", "Did you take the 1500 to move in from her? Therefore making it as much as you owe? You\u2019re the AH.", "Yes exactly", "I\u2019m taking advantage of her? Please\u2026 You sound ignorant. It\u2019s not easy paying someone when your rent is $750 a month, $60 phone bill, $36 gym membership, $50-80 on groceries a week, $12 at the laundromat every week, plus electric/gas that we both go half and half on\u2026. We were also months behind on rent at one point which I had to save every freaking dime I made so we wouldnt get thrown out of our place. I pay her whenever I can!!! So NO it\u2019s not a fuck you to her actually, im trying the best that I can here. At least I\u2019m still paying her!! Better than nothing at all.", "Did you not read anything ?"]}
