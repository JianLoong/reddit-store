Yes she\u2019s getting older and could save it for herself, but she chose to give you guys a gift.

My Na would do the same thing where anytime we were over she\u2019d give me and my brother money. I hated accepting money from her so I would find a way to either put it back in her purse, jacket, bedside table, or somewhere where she\u2019d eventually find it.

You may have thought you were doing the right thing by not taking it, but, for a lot of grandparents, they get far more joy giving money to their grandkids than keeping it for themselves.

Don't deny her of that if she can afford it.", "Eh probably should have taken her out to lunch with it.\n\n\nNAH as you had good intentions. Your sister is the exception though", "YTA- You should take the money. It's not much but she planned and thought about you kids and you rejected her gift.  She know's that it can't be 1000's of pounds but she was giving what she could and felt proud for herself. You pitied her instead.", "YTA just say thank you and accept it. She was probably really excited at the thought of being able to do that for all of you.", "YTA, Just take the money you ungrateful brat. She gives it to you because she wants to. Shut up and take it.", "Woah kinda surprised by all the Y T A but I guess maybe my perspective is different. I think there are NAH. Grandma honestly, probably, already considered her finances before giving the gift- and that's why I think the best option here is to gracefully accept the gift and make a big deal of taking her out for dinner or w/e as a thank you to her thank you. Something  like this shows her you value her efforts, while also letting you feel less guilty about such a thoughtful gift. If it were my grandma we'd be going out for spaghetti to celebrate.", "The most polite thing to do is graciously accept the gift, then either hide the money somewhere or buy her groceries of an equivalent amount or see if there is somewhere she would like to go with you.", "When my grandma gives me money, I usually buy her groceries or invite her to dinner for the amount she gave me.

I was not rude about it and it was definitely not thrown in her face as if I simply didn't want anything she had to give me.", "I was very appreciative of the thought and gesture, and I made her aware of this. I just didn't think it was right because she is nearly 80 and doesn't have much retirement funds to live off of.", "Yeah, this is a fair point. I just thought she could keep it with the cash we collect for a vacation every year. She usually keeps all the money that we will use for food, travel etc.", "I've done this before by just putting back in her purse on my way out, but I didn't get a chance when she wasn't in the room to do it this time.\n\nI'm going to speak to her tomorrow to make sure she isn't upset.

In my culture 11/21/51/101 Rupees are considered auspicious amounts. Whenever an elderly person offers me a cash gift, I return the bulk amount and only keep the minimum auspicious amount as their blessings. You could do the same thing. \n\nTell her you appreciate the thought and ask her for a \"Lucky\" Dollar note or coin and tell her that you'll always keep it in your wallet to remind you of her love. I can bet this gesture will go a long way in making her happy. And nothing like it if you do manage to retain that note or coin.", "In the future, I would take the money and put it away to save in case there's some family situation you can help out with financially.", "And she is an adult and knows that. YTA for taking away your grandma's agency. She is an adult.", "Always accept the gift, then sneak it into her purse/bag later. No hurt feelings, no one feels embarassed, and she finds extra money in her bag later. Everyone wins.", "That's a good suggestion. I would struggle to use the whole \u00a380 to buy her gifts or lunch because she (like me) refuses to let others pay for her or give gifts when it is not her birthday/Christmas. If I only took a small amount, I could probably figure out a good use for it.", "I know she is an adult. She is very healthy and fit for her age and is perfectly capable of looking after herself and her money BUT I would have refused the money no matter who it had come from.", "So you\u2019re just rude in general when someone gives you a gift, not just to your sweet grandma?  Yta", "That is a YOU problem. One of the rules is not to argue and accept your verdict. Doesn't change. You don't get to decide how people spend their money. I wouldn't ever gift you anything again if that's how you are. You need to trust that adults in your life can handle their own lives and money. Why don't you trust your grandma? Actually, I don't want to know.", "Sure", "YTA\n\nThis is something I\u2019ve had to come to terms with. My grandpa is really generous, and money isn\u2019t an issue for him. Since I spend a lot of time with him, I get benefits like going out for meals a lot or going to the casino. He also gives me money for helping him with things.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to politely decline in the past because he doesn\u2019t need to pay me to help him, and I feel like I\u2019m taking advantage. However, as I\u2019ve been told by others, it\u2019s something he wants to do. It\u2019s how he says thanks and what he feels is right. How he wants to help.", "YTA. You should accept a gift whether it is cash, or a ceramic piggy bank painted pink. Your Grandmother planned and saved to give you this gift. While your heart is in the right place, your refusal is very insulting to your Gma and embarrassing as well.\n\nNow, could you use the cash to make her life easier? Sure. Buy some groceries or whatever else she needs. Just refusing is sssoooo rude.", "YTA You are extremely rude thinking you know better than Granma and trying to take her decisions away from her.  You most likely made her feel awful.  Get over yourself.", "Is there a term to say that you were in the wrong but not an a#shole? It\u2019s generally rude to not except a gift but you weren\u2019t an a#shole about it", "Soft yta. You could have saved it to buy something nice for her.", "YTA your grandmother is getting old. What is she gonna do with that money not much if she gives you the money use it enjoy it go out drinking with your mates regardless", "Honestly? NAH but your family might disagree. You wanted your grandmother to have that money to take care of herself, but *she* wants to use it to take care of *you.* \n\nOne of the biggest regrets of my childhood is telling my grandma I could pay for my own earrings (those clay millefiori things that were *so* popular in the 90s) while we were on vacation. She passed suddenly a few weeks later, and I just wish I'd let her buy them for me.", "NTA.", "YTA. I always appreciated the thought of getting a gift from my grandparents.  When I turned into a young adult the gifts were always money, as they thought young adults need it more than children.  What they didn\u2019t know was that, I always used that money to buy them stuff with it.  That way no one\u2019s feelings get hurt, and there is no misunderstandings.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI'm in my early thirties and my grandmother still always gives me approx 50$ when she comes to town. Last year I commented to my mother that it felt silly because I most likely have more money each month than my grandmother and felt weird accepting money from her. My mother explained to me that I should keep accepting the money because it makes my grandmother feel good. So I keep accepting, hugging her and thanking her for the gift. I feel this situation is much the same. Sure she is giving you a gift, but accept it for her not for yourself.", "Ugh, I'm going to say YTA\n\nI hate taking money from old people but you know it came from her heart. I love my gma and accept anything she gave me. She cooked, I ate, she gave us money I accepted. She just wants to see you happy. You could have went over to where ever she is and clean or cooked a meal to show appreciation. Time is what matters not money. And that money is not a small amount, you may want to humble yourself before business school.", "YTA - refusing a gift is always going to hurt the givers feelings - no matter how politely you try to explain yourself.", "Ooof. That\u2019s her love-language. She\u2019s at the stage in life where she gets her way\u2026.. know what I mean?", "My wife use to reject money from her grandmother and her grandmother would sneak into my jacket pocket when no one was looking. \n\nThe first few times we were really confused since I never carry money but eventually we figured to out but never told her grandmother we knew. \n\nIt stayed out secret and we usually used to money to by people coffee. But it made her grandmother happy while my wife got to \u201creject\u201d the money. \n\nI\u2019m not going to judge on this one but I wanted to share. We miss her grandmother", "Sorry, but YTA. It would have been far more polite to accept the gift at the time, then go back alone to privately return the money. Or, even better, use the money to take your grandmother on a variety of outings for just the two of you. You could have created so many wonderful memories with her.", "Yep, if it was me and my nana, I'd be uncomfortable taking the cash too. \n\nHowever I would use it to take her out for a nice meal or whatever she enjoys.\n\nThat way you're not being selfish in taking the money and you get to spend fun memorable times with your grandma.", "Unfortunately, that\u2019s what you did without meaning to. You\u2019re not really an asshole, but I gave you a soft YTA too.", "I have a friend like this. I finally go through to her that at a certain point, she\u2019s insulting me by not accepting my generosity.  You definitely came from a good place, but for some people, this is a way of showing love. My sister and I were just talking about how our dad would hide $20 in our purses (which was a lot in the 90s)!  It is still such a sweet memory bc I knew he was getting such a kick out of it. Let your grandmother be generous to you.", "Don't know why you're getting downvoted for this lol", "You\u2019re a rude child telling an 80 year old woman you know how to manage her money better than her. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nDude. You were totally disrespectful to her. She was being generous and you outright refused her generosity which probably made her feel lousy. Your intentions might have been \u201cgood.\u201d But to me, you come off as a pompous ass. Like you\u2019re too good for any sort of monetary gift as it would be better spent on \u201ccharitable things.\u201d\n\nA gift is not a bribe. I have read your other comments and using her age as an excuse just makes it worse. Does she discuss her finances with you often? Because if not, you\u2019re just assuming she is under financial hardship which would make her feel even lousier. You need to work on being humble, and appreciative rather than treating loved ones like desperate charity cases. Just take the money next time. It won\u2019t damage your self esteem. Just say thank you and accept it. You don\u2019t have to spend the money, you\u2019ve overthought this and it made you come off really shallow towards your family.", "YTA. People give money to show love and to make your life easier. They don\u2019t do it when they don\u2019t want to. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be a little harsher than others to offer a perspective you perhaps haven\u2019t considered. This is the classic case of someone being such a people pleaser that they swing around to being a giant asshole. People give gifts because they *want to.* Especially family. Of course she\u2019s going to be upset when you don\u2019t appreciate or accept it. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly condescending to act like you know better than a grown ass woman what she can afford to give. She\u2019s an adult, and she feels comfortable parting with this money. For you to insinuate that she shouldn\u2019t be, or that you\u2019re somehow doing her a favor by not accepting her gift, is borderline infantilizing. Don\u2019t tell adults how they should/shouldn\u2019t spend their money. \n\nAlso don\u2019t try to paint your sister in a bad light because she joyfully accepted a very kind and thoughtful gift. I\u2019m sure your grandmother appreciated her response far more than yours. It doesn\u2019t make you look kind or thoughtful to refuse a gift because you don\u2019t think the other person is truly wishing to part with it, it just makes you look like you think you know them better than they know themselves. It\u2019s rude. It\u2019s one thing to not accept a gift when the gift is done is poor taste, or if it\u2019s mean spirited, etc. It\u2019s an entirely different thing to take a very thoughtful and kind gift and shove it back at someone because you don\u2019t think they know themselves enough to know that they\u2019re willing to gift that thing.", "YTA for doing it the way you did! \n\nShe offered it to all of you, as a gift. If you're sure that you don't want to take your gift from her, the right thing to do would have been to accept it with gratitude, then pull her aside later *in private* and give it back to her. Explain your stance to her in private. \n\nNot only did you come across as ungrateful to your audience but you put your siblings in a shit situation too. \n\nOur older family members don't always have a lot to live for. If it gives them joy to gift their grandkids, then let them have that joy.", "YTA. Stop trying to save her from giving a gift. Old people like giving young people money because they know you're poor. If you don't want to accept a gift, you sit down with the person later and tell them why, you don't poop on the party.", "NAH... except maybe your sister. Ease know that your grandma wanted to give you that money and that it made her happy. Your sentiment was beautiful but next time accept graciously", "YTA. Learning to accept the generosity of others is an important life lesson. Your \u201cgesture\u201d only made YOU feel better despite your supposed intentions. Being grateful would have made your grandma happy. Instead you made a spectacle out of treating her as being poor and pitiable. YTA YTA YTA", "YTA - you should know how much it means to her to give you what little she has, and this is from her heart and you threw it back. You could take that money and spend it back on her. Things aren\u2019t black and white, sounds like that\u2019s how you operate but life and emotions are more nuanced.", "YTA. It was the thought behind the gift. Your grandmother was trying to give you something and it was an insult that you gave it back. Would you have done the same if it was a blanket or some other trinket or would you give it back saying you don\u2019t need it because they need it more than you or you already have it?!? Appreciate what is given to you and say thank you.", "Your grandmother is an adult, this is something she wanted to do for you and your siblings and you rejected it. A gift is a gift, accept it graciously.", "NTA\n\nIMO, just the fact that you may have hurt her feelings in a minor way temporarily does not make you an AH. However, if you accepted it, and kept doing so each time she offered despite feeling you shouldn't, to me that seems dishonest, which while she might not ever know was the case, if you respect her, would be a much greater slight to her in terms of intent. \n\nAs is, you set a boundary, and are clearly not acting cowardly as you stated you intend to follow up privately with her, so I think what you did was the kindest of your options if accepting the money would make you feel uncomfortable. \n\nGrandma likely would rather you take her money, but if she cares about you, and believed it would legitimately make you feel bad to do so, I have to assume she'd rather not do that. Often grandparents feel like money is the reasons their grandkids come see them, so if you turn it down and continue visiting, that has to feel like a win as well.", "Soft yta.   As a matter if pride and love grands/parents often WANT to give money or provide in some way.  They actually get joy and happiness being able to do so.  You basically threw her happiness in her face.\n\nIf you\u2019re worded about finances\u2026use the money on her.  Bring groceries and make dinner, buy her some nicer Christmas or birthday presents (quietly, don\u2019t let her know the full cost or be showy).  If your parents are helping your grandma out, funnel the mom to them.\n\nJust way better ways", "Soft YTA because you meant well, but you were still rude.\n\nGiving you this money meant a lot to your grandmother. You should have graciously accepted it, thanked her profusely, and done something nice for her on another occasion that would repay her generosity. Maybe you could give her something that would help on her next vacation. (If she is taking vacations she is probably not too hard up for money.)\n\n\"Grandma, I saw this pretty dress and thought it would be perfect for your cruise\".\n\nOr, \"Grandma, I noticed that you needed a new........so I picked this up for you the other day.\"", "NTA\n\nYou accepted the card and want to follow up with her to make sure she understands why you don't want to accept money from her.\n\nWhen my mother was in charge of giving me and my cousins gifts each year from my grandfather's bank account I always declined because I didn't feel the need to take money from someone who needed it as much as me. I would either lie and say that I got something with the giftcard that he had (not) gotten me, or my mother would gift me money from her account instead, insisting that I get a specific item because he wanted me to have it.\n\nEach family is different and I think you're trying to be a respectful adult who doesn't take advantage of their aging relatives. That's a remarkable quality to have.", "NTa.  I wish my kids would give me back the money I give them.  And the cake. Lol", "I don't think you are an AH but sometimes accept things with grace.  She likely felt very embarrassed to be handed it back in public like that. \n\nYou could have also used it to buy her something she needs that she wouldn't buy for herself.  There were so many ways to be graceful here.", "Amateur! You got to make a big deal about it thank her and when she's not paying attention, put the money back in her wallet. \n\nAt least that's what I do when my nanny gives me money, she's disabled and on a fixed income.", "Your not really an asshole, but that was rude to your grandmother. She wanted to give you the money and you gave her gift back. It really does make you look like you\u2019re treating your grandmother like she shouldn\u2019t be able to make her own decisions.", "Soft YTA. Always accept money from grandparents or Elders, because at the end of the day, they just want to help you however they can.\n\nFurthermore, you can use that money to take them out to eat, go shopping with them, or like me, simply reverse pickpocket the money back into their bags so they can discover \u2018surprise money\u2019 for bingo or whatever they like doing", "NAH. Your heart was in the right place,  but returning the cash is a slight, however well intended. Next time, just thank her, and then surprise her shortly after by taking her to a lovely lunch or something with the money (but not mentioning that's the money you're using), or some such thing.", "So very gently, YTA. You are who/what she wants to spend her money on. This is how she is telling/ showing you that you matter to her, she cares about you. You can't take the money with you when you die.", "I understand what you mean, but grandmas are gonna do grandma things such as give you money.\n\nPersonally,  I would have accepted the money and then used it to have lunch with her. Your treat.\n\nI suppose your grandma would like to spend time with you. So this would be a nice way to give her back her money without making it seem like you are rejecting her gift.\n\nEhhhh. YTA.", "graduating college at 18?", "NAH. Next time, take the money. Then use it to buy stuff she needs like stamps or things but won't buy for herself, a new blouse, shoes, books, food that you can make together. You get the idea. \n\nLet her give you a gift. You can regift it back to her subtly. She doesn't want to feel like a burden. She can still contribute. \n\nApologize that you offended her and give her a hug.", "Gentle YTA - Here is a life lesson you can learn from. \u201cHelp others by letting them help you!\u201d \n\nPeople love giving presents to others and it makes them feel really happy! So don\u2019t take that away!", "YTA . If I was to give money as gift to my little nephews or nieces and they refused, I would be heartbroken ngl. People take joy in giving these gifts to their littler kin and to be refused is actually quite upsetting for some people. But hey are you Asian by any chance? Because my grandma constantly gave us money in the red envelopes lol. As I got older I learned the game/ritual. The ritual is you're supposed to do the \"oh no that's too much I can't accept that! \"oh, But I insist.\" \"Oh no please\" and hand the money back and then Grandma tells you to take it and forcefully puts it in your pocket, then you go back in forth with refusing/insisting/wrestling the money away from and to your hands or pocket until you finally say, \" Ohhhhh oh alright.....Thank you Grandma!\" and then take the money lol", "Technically YTA but you\u2019re not actually an AH, I see your intent.

But as people get older they start to lose the things they can do to express love to people around them. \n\nYour grandma was showing you she loved you by giving you a gift. Turning down the gift can be seen as 1. Rejecting her love. 2. Taking away her independence by not allowing her to make her own choice with her own money and 3. Making her feel useless by telling her you don't need her help. \n\nAnd no matter what words you use to explain away your rejection, it's still rejection and it still hurts. \n\nGraciously accept gifts from old people.

Let me elaborate.\n\nMe and my brother got gift from our grandfather last christmass and on one of those we got a bit of money on it. My brother and i declined the money, we told him that we both are working and that money is more useful for him than it is for us and if he really wanted to do something for us we can accept something to eat to get with the family (If someone read this comment, his wife, my grandmother had to deal with cancer and a lot of medical bills and the idea of that money be used on that was more important than just expecting anything for xmas). Like you we both didn't want to be rude, wanted to be assholes, or just downplay the intention but he got a little bit affected by it and yes i felt like shit and it broke my heart a bit. Difference with you our family didn't blame us for doing it, as I spend some time when we exchanged gifts being really thankfull for the gift but saying that we can't accept that specially with everything that was going around until he understood, and it didn't took long but still he got emotional (in a very emotional year).  \n\n\nSo yeah, I'm in the middle.

I realized that it simply made them happy and they weren't in financial straits so I should take it, say thank you, and tell them something that I end up using it for (white lie is acceptable for the last part).

Not just for birthdays but just bits and bobs all the time for no reason. Unless it was a birthday/Christmas gift, I would just say \"no, thank you\". Easier for me as she would give me cheques and I just wouldn't cash them.\n\n\nYears later, she told me off (nicely). She said that she knows I don't need her money but that it was actually not possible for her draw out all her money between now and when she dies. If she just left it all in her bank, it would all be subject to inheritance tax, however, if we just take her handouts, they are gifts and therefore not subject to tax. So basically she said I may as well take it now tax-free than later, heavily taxed!\n\n\nMy grandparents always gave money as gifts in sensible sums but this was after my grandad died and she was seemingly just writing us out \u00a31000 cheques. She actually died shortly after my telling off so I never did actually take her advice/money but retrospectively wish I had because my family squirrelled away all the inheritance in the end anyway!\n\n\nThat said, I don't actually regret it. I didn't need the money and I had a wonderful relationship with my nan despite rejecting her money. :)\n\n\nSummary: NTA whatsoever - but I would advise considering potential ulterior motives AND I also recommend that if you're not already doing so, see that woman as much as possible while you still can.
