I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really an asshole, but grandmas love giving you money! She WANTS to give it to you. The best gift you can give her is to be grateful. :)", "YTA. She tried to do something nice and you threw it back in her face.", "Very gentle YTA. Your grandmother is trying to be nice and if she has the sore cash lying around, why not accept it? I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole, you\u2019re just concerned about something that doesn\u2019t really matter. If your grandmother didn\u2019t want to give you cash, she wouldn\u2019t have. Don\u2019t make the decision for her.", "YTA because it was a gift she wanted you to have. You upset her even more by not being appreciative.", "YTA.\n\nYour heart might be in the right place but refusing to accept a gift is insulting to the giver. You could accept it and really don't feel like keeping it, find another way to regift it to her. In cash, or buy something she needs. That's the better way.", "Gentle YTA, \n\nI completely get your reasoning. My grandmother does the same thing, but look at it this way. Yes she\u2019s getting older and could save it for herself, but she chose to give you guys a gift. By you rejecting it, though your reasoning isn\u2019t wrong, technically you\u2019re showing you don\u2019t appreciate her kind gesture.", "YTA. Don't hurt her feelings by refusing a gift. You could have earmarked that money to spend on doing things with her or maybe help her get groceries etc.", "Soft YTA. Some folks way of showing love is giving. You essentially took her meaningful way of showing care and said \u2018no thanks\u2019. If you were concerned about her finances, the nicer thing to do this accept the money, save it, and gift her something in the future she needs.", "YTA\n\nI get where you're coming from, but she gave it to you, because she wanted to. She probably wishes she could give you more towards school. Either way, it is quite rude to hand a gift directly back to the giver, especially in front of others.", "YTA it is rude to not accept a gift, OP. It doesn't matter if you want the money, she wanted to give it to you as a gift to help you. Part of being polite is accepting gifts graciously, even if you don't want  it necessarily.", "YTA but not a huge one. My Na would do the same thing where anytime we were over she\u2019d give me and my brother money. I hated accepting money from her so I would find a way to either put it back in her purse, jacket, bedside table, or somewhere where she\u2019d eventually find it. That way she wouldn\u2019t feel bad from me rejecting money and I wouldn\u2019t feel bad taking it. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option, you could always use the money on her. Like take her out to lunch or something?", "Yta it was a congratulations gift.  If such a thing happens again jn the future, take the monry and buy a textbook  with it. Then send granny a pic of you with the book signed 'thanks grandma!  I'll think of you when I'm studying!!'", "It was well intended but YTA by accident. You\u2019ll learn as you get older", "YTA put it in your grama fund. Take her to lunch or dinner. Bring her a small gift plant or candy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You may have thought you were doing the right thing by not taking it, but, for a lot of grandparents, they get far more joy giving money to their grandkids than keeping it for themselves. I mean, the fact that she gave it to you on \\*her\\* birthday should have made that clear.", "There is often joy in giving. Don't deny her of that if she can afford it.", "Eh probably should have taken her out to lunch with it.\n\n\nNAH as you had good intentions. Your sister is the exception though", "YTA- You should take the money. It's not much but she planned and thought about you kids and you rejected her gift.  She know's that it can't be 1000's of pounds but she was giving what she could and felt proud for herself. You pitied her instead.", "YTA just say thank you and accept it. She was probably really excited at the thought of being able to do that for all of you.", "YTA, Just take the money you ungrateful brat. She gives it to you because she wants to. Shut up and take it.", "Woah kinda surprised by all the Y T A but I guess maybe my perspective is different. I think there are NAH. Grandma honestly, probably, already considered her finances before giving the gift- and that's why I think the best option here is to gracefully accept the gift and make a big deal of taking her out for dinner or w/e as a thank you to her thank you. Something  like this shows her you value her efforts, while also letting you feel less guilty about such a thoughtful gift. If it were my grandma we'd be going out for spaghetti to celebrate.", "The most polite thing to do is graciously accept the gift, then either hide the money somewhere or buy her groceries of an equivalent amount or see if there is somewhere she would like to go with you.", "When my grandma gives me money, I usually buy her groceries or invite her to dinner for the amount she gave me. She is happy. That she could gift me something and I don't feel bad taking money from her.\n\nYou meant well but didn't think it through. Soft YTA", "I gave her the money back and explained why I couldn't accept it. I was not rude about it and it was definitely not thrown in her face as if I simply didn't want anything she had to give me.", "I was very appreciative of the thought and gesture, and I made her aware of this. I just didn't think it was right because she is nearly 80 and doesn't have much retirement funds to live off of.", "Yeah, this is a fair point. I just thought she could keep it with the cash we collect for a vacation every year. She usually keeps all the money that we will use for food, travel etc.", "I've done this before by just putting back in her purse on my way out, but I didn't get a chance when she wasn't in the room to do it this time.\n\nI'm going to speak to her tomorrow to make sure she isn't upset. She knows me well, and she also knows I really struggle to let anyone pay for my meals or give me money when I am able to provide for myself and my loved ones.", "Whether you intended to or not, that\u2019s exactly what you did.", "I'm an Indian. In my culture 11/21/51/101 Rupees are considered auspicious amounts. Whenever an elderly person offers me a cash gift, I return the bulk amount and only keep the minimum auspicious amount as their blessings. You could do the same thing. \n\nTell her you appreciate the thought and ask her for a \"Lucky\" Dollar note or coin and tell her that you'll always keep it in your wallet to remind you of her love. I can bet this gesture will go a long way in making her happy. And nothing like it if you do manage to retain that note or coin.", "In the future, I would take the money and put it away to save in case there's some family situation you can help out with financially.", "And she is an adult and knows that. YTA for taking away your grandma's agency. She is an adult.", "Always accept the gift, then sneak it into her purse/bag later. No hurt feelings, no one feels embarassed, and she finds extra money in her bag later. Everyone wins.", "That's a good suggestion. I would struggle to use the whole \u00a380 to buy her gifts or lunch because she (like me) refuses to let others pay for her or give gifts when it is not her birthday/Christmas. If I only took a small amount, I could probably figure out a good use for it.", "I know she is an adult. She is very healthy and fit for her age and is perfectly capable of looking after herself and her money BUT I would have refused the money no matter who it had come from.", "So you\u2019re just rude in general when someone gives you a gift, not just to your sweet grandma?  Yta", "That is a YOU problem. One of the rules is not to argue and accept your verdict. Doesn't change. You don't get to decide how people spend their money. I wouldn't ever gift you anything again if that's how you are. You need to trust that adults in your life can handle their own lives and money. Why don't you trust your grandma? Actually, I don't want to know.", "Sure"]}
