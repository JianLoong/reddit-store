Yes she\u2019s getting older and could save it for herself, but she chose to give you guys a gift.

My Na would do the same thing where anytime we were over she\u2019d give me and my brother money. I hated accepting money from her so I would find a way to either put it back in her purse, jacket, bedside table, or somewhere where she\u2019d eventually find it.

You may have thought you were doing the right thing by not taking it, but, for a lot of grandparents, they get far more joy giving money to their grandkids than keeping it for themselves. I mean, the fact that she gave it to you on \\*her\\* birthday should have made that clear.", "There is often joy in giving. Don't deny her of that if she can afford it.", "Eh probably should have taken her out to lunch with it.\n\n\nNAH as you had good intentions. Your sister is the exception though", "YTA- You should take the money. It's not much but she planned and thought about you kids and you rejected her gift.  She know's that it can't be 1000's of pounds but she was giving what she could and felt proud for herself. You pitied her instead.", "YTA just say thank you and accept it. She was probably really excited at the thought of being able to do that for all of you.", "YTA, Just take the money you ungrateful brat. She gives it to you because she wants to. Shut up and take it.", "Woah kinda surprised by all the Y T A but I guess maybe my perspective is different. I think there are NAH. Grandma honestly, probably, already considered her finances before giving the gift- and that's why I think the best option here is to gracefully accept the gift and make a big deal of taking her out for dinner or w/e as a thank you to her thank you. Something  like this shows her you value her efforts, while also letting you feel less guilty about such a thoughtful gift. If it were my grandma we'd be going out for spaghetti to celebrate.", "The most polite thing to do is graciously accept the gift, then either hide the money somewhere or buy her groceries of an equivalent amount or see if there is somewhere she would like to go with you.", "When my grandma gives me money, I usually buy her groceries or invite her to dinner for the amount she gave me. She is happy. That she could gift me something and I don't feel bad taking money from her.\n\nYou meant well but didn't think it through. Soft YTA", "I gave her the money back and explained why I couldn't accept it. I was not rude about it and it was definitely not thrown in her face as if I simply didn't want anything she had to give me.", "I was very appreciative of the thought and gesture, and I made her aware of this. I just didn't think it was right because she is nearly 80 and doesn't have much retirement funds to live off of.", "Yeah, this is a fair point. I just thought she could keep it with the cash we collect for a vacation every year. She usually keeps all the money that we will use for food, travel etc.", "I've done this before by just putting back in her purse on my way out, but I didn't get a chance when she wasn't in the room to do it this time.\n\nI'm going to speak to her tomorrow to make sure she isn't upset. She knows me well, and she also knows I really struggle to let anyone pay for my meals or give me money when I am able to provide for myself and my loved ones.", "Whether you intended to or not, that\u2019s exactly what you did.", "I'm an Indian. In my culture 11/21/51/101 Rupees are considered auspicious amounts. Whenever an elderly person offers me a cash gift, I return the bulk amount and only keep the minimum auspicious amount as their blessings. You could do the same thing. \n\nTell her you appreciate the thought and ask her for a \"Lucky\" Dollar note or coin and tell her that you'll always keep it in your wallet to remind you of her love. I can bet this gesture will go a long way in making her happy. And nothing like it if you do manage to retain that note or coin.", "In the future, I would take the money and put it away to save in case there's some family situation you can help out with financially.", "And she is an adult and knows that. YTA for taking away your grandma's agency. She is an adult.", "Always accept the gift, then sneak it into her purse/bag later. No hurt feelings, no one feels embarassed, and she finds extra money in her bag later. Everyone wins.", "That's a good suggestion. I would struggle to use the whole \u00a380 to buy her gifts or lunch because she (like me) refuses to let others pay for her or give gifts when it is not her birthday/Christmas. If I only took a small amount, I could probably figure out a good use for it.", "I know she is an adult. She is very healthy and fit for her age and is perfectly capable of looking after herself and her money BUT I would have refused the money no matter who it had come from.", "So you\u2019re just rude in general when someone gives you a gift, not just to your sweet grandma?  Yta", "That is a YOU problem. One of the rules is not to argue and accept your verdict. Doesn't change. You don't get to decide how people spend their money. I wouldn't ever gift you anything again if that's how you are. You need to trust that adults in your life can handle their own lives and money. Why don't you trust your grandma? Actually, I don't want to know.", "Sure", "YTA\n\nThis is something I\u2019ve had to come to terms with. My grandpa is really generous, and money isn\u2019t an issue for him. Since I spend a lot of time with him, I get benefits like going out for meals a lot or going to the casino. He also gives me money for helping him with things.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to politely decline in the past because he doesn\u2019t need to pay me to help him, and I feel like I\u2019m taking advantage. However, as I\u2019ve been told by others, it\u2019s something he wants to do. It\u2019s how he says thanks and what he feels is right. How he wants to help.", "YTA. You should accept a gift whether it is cash, or a ceramic piggy bank painted pink. Your Grandmother planned and saved to give you this gift. While your heart is in the right place, your refusal is very insulting to your Gma and embarrassing as well.\n\nNow, could you use the cash to make her life easier? Sure. Buy some groceries or whatever else she needs. Just refusing is sssoooo rude.", "YTA You are extremely rude thinking you know better than Granma and trying to take her decisions away from her.  You most likely made her feel awful.  Get over yourself.", "Is there a term to say that you were in the wrong but not an a#shole? It\u2019s generally rude to not except a gift but you weren\u2019t an a#shole about it", "Soft yta. You could have saved it to buy something nice for her.", "YTA your grandmother is getting old. What is she gonna do with that money not much if she gives you the money use it enjoy it go out drinking with your mates regardless", "Honestly? NAH but your family might disagree. You wanted your grandmother to have that money to take care of herself, but *she* wants to use it to take care of *you.* \n\nOne of the biggest regrets of my childhood is telling my grandma I could pay for my own earrings (those clay millefiori things that were *so* popular in the 90s) while we were on vacation. She passed suddenly a few weeks later, and I just wish I'd let her buy them for me.", "NTA.", "YTA. I always appreciated the thought of getting a gift from my grandparents.  When I turned into a young adult the gifts were always money, as they thought young adults need it more than children.  What they didn\u2019t know was that, I always used that money to buy them stuff with it.  That way no one\u2019s feelings get hurt, and there is no misunderstandings.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI'm in my early thirties and my grandmother still always gives me approx 50$ when she comes to town. Last year I commented to my mother that it felt silly because I most likely have more money each month than my grandmother and felt weird accepting money from her. My mother explained to me that I should keep accepting the money because it makes my grandmother feel good. So I keep accepting, hugging her and thanking her for the gift. I feel this situation is much the same. Sure she is giving you a gift, but accept it for her not for yourself.", "Ugh, I'm going to say YTA\n\nI hate taking money from old people but you know it came from her heart. I love my gma and accept anything she gave me. She cooked, I ate, she gave us money I accepted. She just wants to see you happy. You could have went over to where ever she is and clean or cooked a meal to show appreciation. Time is what matters not money. And that money is not a small amount, you may want to humble yourself before business school.", "YTA - refusing a gift is always going to hurt the givers feelings - no matter how politely you try to explain yourself.", "Ooof. That\u2019s her love-language. She\u2019s at the stage in life where she gets her way\u2026.. know what I mean?", "My wife use to reject money from her grandmother and her grandmother would sneak into my jacket pocket when no one was looking. \n\nThe first few times we were really confused since I never carry money but eventually we figured to out but never told her grandmother we knew. \n\nIt stayed out secret and we usually used to money to by people coffee. But it made her grandmother happy while my wife got to \u201creject\u201d the money. \n\nI\u2019m not going to judge on this one but I wanted to share. We miss her grandmother", "Sorry, but YTA. It would have been far more polite to accept the gift at the time, then go back alone to privately return the money. Or, even better, use the money to take your grandmother on a variety of outings for just the two of you. You could have created so many wonderful memories with her.", "Yep, if it was me and my nana, I'd be uncomfortable taking the cash too. \n\nHowever I would use it to take her out for a nice meal or whatever she enjoys.\n\nThat way you're not being selfish in taking the money and you get to spend fun memorable times with your grandma.", "Unfortunately, that\u2019s what you did without meaning to. You\u2019re not really an asshole, but I gave you a soft YTA too.", "I have a friend like this. I finally go through to her that at a certain point, she\u2019s insulting me by not accepting my generosity.  You definitely came from a good place, but for some people, this is a way of showing love. My sister and I were just talking about how our dad would hide $20 in our purses (which was a lot in the 90s)!  It is still such a sweet memory bc I knew he was getting such a kick out of it. Let your grandmother be generous to you.", "Don't know why you're getting downvoted for this lol", "You\u2019re a rude child telling an 80 year old woman you know how to manage her money better than her. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nDude. You were totally disrespectful to her. She was being generous and you outright refused her generosity which probably made her feel lousy. Your intentions might have been \u201cgood.\u201d But to me, you come off as a pompous ass. Like you\u2019re too good for any sort of monetary gift as it would be better spent on \u201ccharitable things.\u201d\n\nA gift is not a bribe. I have read your other comments and using her age as an excuse just makes it worse. Does she discuss her finances with you often? Because if not, you\u2019re just assuming she is under financial hardship which would make her feel even lousier. You need to work on being humble, and appreciative rather than treating loved ones like desperate charity cases. Just take the money next time. It won\u2019t damage your self esteem. Just say thank you and accept it. You don\u2019t have to spend the money, you\u2019ve overthought this and it made you come off really shallow towards your family.", "YTA. People give money to show love and to make your life easier. They don\u2019t do it when they don\u2019t want to. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be a little harsher than others to offer a perspective you perhaps haven\u2019t considered. This is the classic case of someone being such a people pleaser that they swing around to being a giant asshole. People give gifts because they *want to.* Especially family. Of course she\u2019s going to be upset when you don\u2019t appreciate or accept it. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly condescending to act like you know better than a grown ass woman what she can afford to give. She\u2019s an adult, and she feels comfortable parting with this money. For you to insinuate that she shouldn\u2019t be, or that you\u2019re somehow doing her a favor by not accepting her gift, is borderline infantilizing. Don\u2019t tell adults how they should/shouldn\u2019t spend their money. \n\nAlso don\u2019t try to paint your sister in a bad light because she joyfully accepted a very kind and thoughtful gift. I\u2019m sure your grandmother appreciated her response far more than yours. It doesn\u2019t make you look kind or thoughtful to refuse a gift because you don\u2019t think the other person is truly wishing to part with it, it just makes you look like you think you know them better than they know themselves. It\u2019s rude. It\u2019s one thing to not accept a gift when the gift is done is poor taste, or if it\u2019s mean spirited, etc. It\u2019s an entirely different thing to take a very thoughtful and kind gift and shove it back at someone because you don\u2019t think they know themselves enough to know that they\u2019re willing to gift that thing.", "YTA for doing it the way you did! \n\nShe offered it to all of you, as a gift. If you're sure that you don't want to take your gift from her, the right thing to do would have been to accept it with gratitude, then pull her aside later *in private* and give it back to her. Explain your stance to her in private. \n\nNot only did you come across as ungrateful to your audience but you put your siblings in a shit situation too. \n\nOur older family members don't always have a lot to live for. If it gives them joy to gift their grandkids, then let them have that joy.", "YTA. Stop trying to save her from giving a gift. Old people like giving young people money because they know you're poor. If you don't want to accept a gift, you sit down with the person later and tell them why, you don't poop on the party.", "NAH... except maybe your sister. Ease know that your grandma wanted to give you that money and that it made her happy. Your sentiment was beautiful but next time accept graciously", "YTA. Learning to accept the generosity of others is an important life lesson. Your \u201cgesture\u201d only made YOU feel better despite your supposed intentions. Being grateful would have made your grandma happy. Instead you made a spectacle out of treating her as being poor and pitiable. YTA YTA YTA", "YTA - you should know how much it means to her to give you what little she has, and this is from her heart and you threw it back. You could take that money and spend it back on her. Things aren\u2019t black and white, sounds like that\u2019s how you operate but life and emotions are more nuanced.", "YTA. It was the thought behind the gift. Your grandmother was trying to give you something and it was an insult that you gave it back. Would you have done the same if it was a blanket or some other trinket or would you give it back saying you don\u2019t need it because they need it more than you or you already have it?!? Appreciate what is given to you and say thank you.", "Your grandmother is an adult, this is something she wanted to do for you and your siblings and you rejected it. A gift is a gift, accept it graciously.", "NTA\n\nIMO, just the fact that you may have hurt her feelings in a minor way temporarily does not make you an AH. However, if you accepted it, and kept doing so each time she offered despite feeling you shouldn't, to me that seems dishonest, which while she might not ever know was the case, if you respect her, would be a much greater slight to her in terms of intent. \n\nAs is, you set a boundary, and are clearly not acting cowardly as you stated you intend to follow up privately with her, so I think what you did was the kindest of your options if accepting the money would make you feel uncomfortable. \n\nGrandma likely would rather you take her money, but if she cares about you, and believed it would legitimately make you feel bad to do so, I have to assume she'd rather not do that. Often grandparents feel like money is the reasons their grandkids come see them, so if you turn it down and continue visiting, that has to feel like a win as well.", "Soft yta.   As a matter if pride and love grands/parents often WANT to give money or provide in some way.  They actually get joy and happiness being able to do so.  You basically threw her happiness in her face.\n\nIf you\u2019re worded about finances\u2026use the money on her.  Bring groceries and make dinner, buy her some nicer Christmas or birthday presents (quietly, don\u2019t let her know the full cost or be showy).  If your parents are helping your grandma out, funnel the mom to them.\n\nJust way better ways", "Soft YTA because you meant well, but you were still rude.\n\nGiving you this money meant a lot to your grandmother. You should have graciously accepted it, thanked her profusely, and done something nice for her on another occasion that would repay her generosity. Maybe you could give her something that would help on her next vacation. (If she is taking vacations she is probably not too hard up for money.)\n\n\"Grandma, I saw this pretty dress and thought it would be perfect for your cruise\".\n\nOr, \"Grandma, I noticed that you needed a new........so I picked this up for you the other day.\"", "NTA\n\nYou accepted the card and want to follow up with her to make sure she understands why you don't want to accept money from her.\n\nWhen my mother was in charge of giving me and my cousins gifts each year from my grandfather's bank account I always declined because I didn't feel the need to take money from someone who needed it as much as me. I would either lie and say that I got something with the giftcard that he had (not) gotten me, or my mother would gift me money from her account instead, insisting that I get a specific item because he wanted me to have it.\n\nEach family is different and I think you're trying to be a respectful adult who doesn't take advantage of their aging relatives. That's a remarkable quality to have.", "NTa.  I wish my kids would give me back the money I give them.  And the cake. Lol", "I don't think you are an AH but sometimes accept things with grace.  She likely felt very embarrassed to be handed it back in public like that. \n\nYou could have also used it to buy her something she needs that she wouldn't buy for herself.  There were so many ways to be graceful here.", "Amateur! You got to make a big deal about it thank her and when she's not paying attention, put the money back in her wallet. \n\nAt least that's what I do when my nanny gives me money, she's disabled and on a fixed income.", "Your not really an asshole, but that was rude to your grandmother. She wanted to give you the money and you gave her gift back. It really does make you look like you\u2019re treating your grandmother like she shouldn\u2019t be able to make her own decisions.", "Soft YTA. Always accept money from grandparents or Elders, because at the end of the day, they just want to help you however they can.\n\nFurthermore, you can use that money to take them out to eat, go shopping with them, or like me, simply reverse pickpocket the money back into their bags so they can discover \u2018surprise money\u2019 for bingo or whatever they like doing", "NAH. Your heart was in the right place,  but returning the cash is a slight, however well intended. Next time, just thank her, and then surprise her shortly after by taking her to a lovely lunch or something with the money (but not mentioning that's the money you're using), or some such thing.", "So very gently, YTA. You are who/what she wants to spend her money on. This is how she is telling/ showing you that you matter to her, she cares about you. You can't take the money with you when you die.", "I understand what you mean, but grandmas are gonna do grandma things such as give you money.\n\nPersonally,  I would have accepted the money and then used it to have lunch with her. Your treat.\n\nI suppose your grandma would like to spend time with you. So this would be a nice way to give her back her money without making it seem like you are rejecting her gift.\n\nEhhhh. YTA.", "graduating college at 18?", "NAH. Next time, take the money. Then use it to buy stuff she needs like stamps or things but won't buy for herself, a new blouse, shoes, books, food that you can make together. You get the idea. \n\nLet her give you a gift. You can regift it back to her subtly. She doesn't want to feel like a burden. She can still contribute. \n\nApologize that you offended her and give her a hug.", "Gentle YTA - Here is a life lesson you can learn from. \u201cHelp others by letting them help you!\u201d \n\nPeople love giving presents to others and it makes them feel really happy! So don\u2019t take that away!", "YTA . If I was to give money as gift to my little nephews or nieces and they refused, I would be heartbroken ngl. People take joy in giving these gifts to their littler kin and to be refused is actually quite upsetting for some people. But hey are you Asian by any chance? Because my grandma constantly gave us money in the red envelopes lol. As I got older I learned the game/ritual. The ritual is you're supposed to do the \"oh no that's too much I can't accept that! \"oh, But I insist.\" \"Oh no please\" and hand the money back and then Grandma tells you to take it and forcefully puts it in your pocket, then you go back in forth with refusing/insisting/wrestling the money away from and to your hands or pocket until you finally say, \" Ohhhhh oh alright.....Thank you Grandma!\" and then take the money lol", "Technically YTA but you\u2019re not actually an AH, I see your intent. I used to do this too. But once my aunt pulled me aside and told me \u201cyour grandparents have money, and it\u2019s a little rude to not accept, they find it offensive so always take it and say thank you\u201d so that\u2019s what I do now.", "YTA. I see where you're coming from. And your heart was in the right place. But as people get older they start to lose the things they can do to express love to people around them. \n\nYour grandma was showing you she loved you by giving you a gift. Turning down the gift can be seen as 1. Rejecting her love. 2. Taking away her independence by not allowing her to make her own choice with her own money and 3. Making her feel useless by telling her you don't need her help. \n\nAnd no matter what words you use to explain away your rejection, it's still rejection and it still hurts. \n\nGraciously accept gifts from old people. Let your grandma love you in the way she chooses.", "Soft YTA. \n\nFor years my grandmother would give me money and I would use it to buy a gift card to her favorite restaurant, then when we would meet there for lunch I\u2019d always conveniently remember I had a gift card. \n\nMaybe next time she gives you money, set it aside to do something special with her?", "The softest of Y T A s.\n\nI've done the same, turning down money to replace a fridge and having to be talked into accepting it by my family.\n\nWhat I didn't understand is that people age their ability to be useful diminishes and eventually they feel useless.  Giving money becomes their only viable contribution and they'll jump on a deserving cause.\n\nTake the money, and be honored she thinks you're worthy.", "You graduated college and got accepted into business school at 18 years old?", "i dont have a judgement to pass on, just some of my grandparents wisdom-- my grandparents would always want to give me money every time they saw me. my poppa and nonna would bicker about who got to give it to me each time. i was always uncomfortable and always told them to take it back, but they always told me to hush and that they wanted to give it to me. \n\nwhen my grandparents started to get older, id do the same thing but i stopped after my grandfather said to me, \"i want to give this to you while im still alive, not when im dead,\" (talking about wills and such) and it. changed me to be honest.... hes doing this now, for me, because it brings him joy to help me with money he worked so hard for. every time after that, i always always always gave them each a big hug and told them thank you and that i loved them. \n\ntheyve since passed, but my grandfather was right. i was much happier seeing him, and watching him be happy giving me money, than to get it from their deaths. Next time you see your grandmother, tell her thank you, you love her, and youd love to take her to breakfast", "NTA but you might have hurt her feelings by not accepting it. Maybe next time, accept the cash and find a way to sneak it back to her so you can spare her pride.

I don\u2019t know about you, but refusing gifts from grandma was probably worse than adultery in my family.  I 100% understand where your coming from, me and my mother were dirt poor for a long time and it\u2019s made it difficult for me to accept gifts/ask for things.  You are currently the WORLD to that woman, I guarantee she would give you her bank account if it made you happy.  You are not an asshole at all, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "Very mild YTA, she really wanted to give you the money. You accepting and appreciating it would've made a good birthday gift for her.", "Yea YTA it\u2019s pretty rude to refuse someone\u2019s gift like that. Especially when it\u2019s an elderly person who is just trying to love on you. She just wants you to feel supported and like she doing something for you when she can probably do very little compared to everyone else. The joy she feels knowing she\u2019s done something is taken away from her when you refuse. With the little life she has left you could at least accept the sacrifices she makes for you so she can leave the world knowing she did SOMETHING for her granddaughter. It might also make her feel like her contributions aren\u2019t big enough or don\u2019t make a difference to your life if you refuse so next time just be gracious and grateful and just say thank you.", "YTA\n\nYou should have done that privately.  I can understand you not wanting to accept money, especially when she gifted all 3 grandchildren at the same time. That could be a lot of money for someone on a fixed income.", "YTA only for rejecting it publicly. You should have taken the money then gave it back to her privately.", "YTA, but only because it\u2019s clear it means something to your grandma for you to have the money. I know it can be awkward and we\u2019d rather they keep the money for something else but this is a grandma thing. Imagine her making you food and you saying no thank you and handing it back. That\u2019s how it felt to her.", "Next time if you don't want it, buy something for HER or take her out to lunch or something with the $ she gives you. Everyone's happy.", "Piggybacking to say that you sound like a sweet granddaughter. That said sometimes the best you can do is to graciously accept said gift. And for some that is not easy feat(myself included) . But it\u2019s worth trying. \n\nI remember telling my grandfather his and my grandmothers gift was too much and he told me it wasn\u2019t enough. I found it so touching. The best I could do was say thank you.", "As people get older, they want to see the things they worked for passed down to help their family.  And many would prefer to do this while they're alive to see it.\n\nShe's very proud of you, and she knows how challenging this phase of life is for young people, so she wanted to help.\n\nUnless there are concerns about her mental health (ie not knowing she's giving money away), the appropriate response is \"thank you so much!  I'll put this toward getting set up for school (or insert other good cause)\" and a hug.\n\nIf you feel guilty, you can also follow it up with a \"Hi Nan!  How are you?  Just calling because, do you remember the money you gave me last week?  Well I bought this great backpack for all my school stuff, and I think it's going to be fantastic, and I wanted to thank you again\"  Then talk about whatever for a while.\n\nThat's it.  That phone call from a grand-daughter will make her week.", "There needs to be a different term than AH. OP means well, but her grandmother was just trying to do something nice.

Turning immediately around and getting her things that she could've gotten if she didn't give you anything is just rejecting the gesture with extra steps.", "It's her money, she gets to choose how she spends it. I think most women her age would rather have relationships with their grandchildren than lonely vacations. \n\nShe's also trying to interact with you and make a connection. And you shut that right down.", "So she has meager means and she scraped together a small gift to make sure she gave you *something* because it was important to HER to do so.\n\nCould you imagine putting together a loving card and gift for someone you care so much about. Probably going without in order to make sure you could. Then proudly giving them that gift wishing you could give more - only to have them refuse it? What a punch in the gut to your poor grandma.", "You really are a condescending little know-it-all, thinking you can manage your grandmother's budget better than she can. It's really disrespectful to act as if you know better than her how she should spend her money. Especially if you are saying she couldn't afford the cash gifts she gave. If she couldn't afford it, she would have given less.", "I would be so upset if my 18 year old grandchild thought so little of me and my ability to manage my own life and finances that she'd disrespect me like this.  YTA.  Not sure who taught you manners but perhaps you need to go back for a remedial course.", "You didn't intend to be rude, but it definitely hurt her feelings when she wanted to do something nice. \n\nIt's also patronising to assume that she's giving you something that she can't afford. She obviously figured she could afford it, as she is an adult who has been capable of setting a gift budget for decades before you were born. If she couldn't afford to give away \u00a3240 (80 x 3), she would have set a smaller amount. She didn't have to give anything at all. \n\nShe made an independent decision to be generous, and your response was that she had done the wrong thing.", "Dude, my grandma once gave me a an orange tree branch with oranges on it for Xmas because she wanted me to have something from her but didn't have anything else to give me, and i graciously took it. I thiught it was hilarious. No matter how polite you were, grandma likely feels bad you didn't want her gift.

It's not that I need the money, but I just figure it gives her a sense of purpose and value.  That she can still give something, and that it means something to us.  Denying it is kinda like saying \"no no, don't bother, your worthless!\"  I say that because that's what I was told from an elderly gentleman in a similar situation.\n\nI'm trying not to tell you what you are or are not, but just to illuminate another perspective.  Instead of telling your grandmother what she should do or think, maybe listen to what she wants, and thinks.

It was a gift. I have to ask were you trying to \u201cone up\u201d your siblings? \nThis was a classless move on your part. The whole world is not about you.

She took the time and thought of you. Be grateful. Life works so much better.", "That\u2019s a traditional gift. YTA. You also made it weird. Stop being so holier-than-thou and just be gracious. What you did wasn\u2019t gracious.", "Soft YTA. Wouldn't you be hurt if you put a gift together for someone to surprise them and they publicly refused to accept it? You may have meant well but you took the joy of giving away from your grandma. Refusing the money also puts your siblings in an awkward situation and it isn't fair to them. If you truly don't think she can afford it, sneak it back later or use it on her.", "Soft YTA. I think when you\u2019re younger you prioritize upholding principles rigidly. However, you need to become more flexible in life and sometimes bend those rules to maximize the happiness of others, especially your grandma who seems wonderful.\n\nThink of how much joy she gets from you gratefully accepting.

Have you ever heart the phrase, \u201cit\u2019s more blessed to give than to receive\u201d? This is a true statement. By refusing to accept her gift, you are denying her that blessing. It makes her feel good to do it, and it\u2019s giving her a chance to invest a little toward your education or to use it to treat yourself. That makes the sacrifice worth it. She is in the stage of life where ppl start thinking of the legacy they want to leave behind. As long as she\u2019s of sound mind and not destitute, let her be generous.", "NAH but my advice, just take it. Give it charity. Save it for doing something for her on Christmas or her next birthday. Pass it forward to someone. She knows what she's doing and understands what her money is worth, and knows tat the value the money represents as a gift and recognition is worth more than the financial loss of giving it away.\n\nWhile people like you do this out of a kindness and humility that is respectable, I think it takes more humility and respect to recieve a gift and trust in the giver.\n\nGift giving is fun and a core part of the human experience.
