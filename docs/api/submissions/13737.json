However, this shouldn\u2019t have been allowed 10x +. Kim\u2019s passive aggressive, and clearly unfit for the job, and that\u2019ll show to everyone in HR.

She was making her peers uncomfortable.", "NTA. The one thing I would have done differently was discuss with HR what you were going to do and why, before you met with her.
