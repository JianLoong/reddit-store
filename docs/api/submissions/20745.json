Her biological father is unknown and her aunt did not want her. \n\nMy father's ILs mentioned my name to CPS initially and I was asked if I would take her as well. I said I would not.

Our father wouldn't have noticed since he was not the kind of father who really cared.\n\nEver since my father's wife died her parents have been contacting me (mostly via social media or email). They wanted me to take their granddaughter. Would not take no for an answer. Tried to get my siblings to ask for us to have her. Was promptly blocked from all their accounts and later mine (not active enough on social media to care for a while). The emails continued and then I found out they had taken my number from my father's phone and started making contact through that. I dealt with this until May when I reached out to CPS and told the case worker that they were trying to pawn their granddaughter off on me and I was not interested but they refused to take no for an answer. I did this after multiple attempts to tell them no and tell them to stop and even trying to ignore them and not respond.\n\nThey went crazy on me after this. I know it's them buying either some burner phones or having a bunch of sim cards or something. I'd block a number and a new one would come. They told me I am being an evil shit and we are ignoring our sister (she is not biologically related to us and our father never adopted her). They said she belongs with her siblings and misses them.

They're harassing you. Like, within the legal definition of *harassment* and you could consider a restraining order at this point.\n\nIn my state, for example:\n\n> conduct directed toward a victim that includes but is not limited to repeated or continuing impermissible contact that would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress and that actually causes the victim to suffer emotional distress.", "NTA. Seems likely that girl is not safe with them and CPS should be involved. Frankly I'd talk to your local PD about a restraining order as well. What they're doing absolutely rises to the level of harassment.\n\nAlso can't hurt to talk to a lawyer, just to have an initial consultation and establish that relationship, that way you'll have someone to call who already knows the situation if/when things escalate.", "NTA.  There\u2019s no biological relation AND it appears your siblings didn\u2019t have an attachment.  Seems to me her grandparents are narcissists who only care about themselves, rather then their grandchildren.", "NTA. Your reports need to be to police not CPS. The issue here is stalking and/or harassment. Document everything. Time/date/number etc. Change your phone number and take care to protect your family. The girl probably does miss your siblings- they\u2019re the only \u201cfamily\u201d she really knows but that doesn\u2019t legally make her your responsibility or theirs. She\u2019s completely innocent and my heart breaks for her but at 22 you have enough on your plate here.", "NTA \n\nGet a lawyer and send a cease and desist.\nReport the harassment to the police \nDocument and keep everything", "NTA, as their strong desire to get rid of the girl could be a red flag for neglect. I understand your siblings not having any real attachment to the girl, but if she\u2019s under 10 (as you think she is), she may have a different perspective. If she saw your siblings a lot more than her grandparents, she may view them as more familiar than her grandparents. I feel bad for the poor girl because no one appears to want her just because she\u2019s an orphan. You may not want to adopt her, and I don\u2019t think you should give her grandparents any indication that you\u2019re willing to take care of her, but I would have a conversation with your siblings regarding possibly meeting up with her on occasion so she still has a sense of family (that of course depends on how long her mom was with your dad\u2026a few months probably not, but a few years, I would say that makes you something of a family because that\u2019s a good chunk of her life thus far).", "NTA\n\nI feel for the kid. But you already took on a lot with your bio siblings. You did the right thing.", "NTA and at this point, I think you have enough proof to report them for stalking. They're basically harrassing you.", "NTA\n\nThey don't care about boundaries.", "NTA.. time to change your number.  Most phone companys will do it for free if it is due to harrassment.  Also restraining order. I filed one myself at the courthouse.  No charge.", "NTA. You should also report them to the police for harassment & stalking. It'll help if you saved any social media or recorded messages.", "NTA\n\nNo means no. You are not obligated to take in a non-related kid, especially when you already have your hands full with your two siblings.\n\nGet a restraining order.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have not seen her or had anything to do with her since. I saw my siblings but had nothing to do with her. Though I do admit she may have attached to my siblings some.

They are the AHs. No matter how old my parents are they\u2019d fight to have and care for their own grandchild  in this situation  and be keen to look after her even at aged 80..! \n\nI agree with others I\u2019d be tempted to change my mobile number despite the annoyance that\u2019d bring\nThey are harassing you . You have said no and asked them to stop contacting  you", "This is what I came here to say.  My law school absolutely had one, and I think most of them do."]}
