Things have moved very quickly, we see each other 4/5 times a week, she stays at mine 4 nights a week. She\u2019s coming to live with me for 2 weeks soon while her parents are away, we were looking at holidays. \n\nShe has a gay friend, Tom, who she\u2019s known (works with) for a long time but has only been friends/close with him for 4 months, after she split with her ex 5 months ago. Tom is now married as of this year too. Tom & I get on well, and we do things as a 4 sometimes now too. \n\nShe showed me this romantic getaway lodge in the forest \u201clook what Tom sent me, Tom & I are thinking of booking what do you think\u201d I thought she meant booking for her & I, Tom & Toms hub. \n\nWe were having a conversation about boundaries, she asked me what I considered to be crossing the line. I said for me, sharing a bed with another man. She said \u201cso I can\u2019t go away with Tom then?\u201d I said what do you mean, turns out she meant for just her & Tom to go away on this romantic getaway lodge, not the 4 of us.\n\n1. I said I\u2019m not comfortable with her sharing the bed with any man, which includes Tom. It\u2019s just crossing a line. Just get twin beds..?\n\n2. Why would you want to do something romantic like that with someone you\u2019re not romantic with? Especially given that her & I haven\u2019t even done that yet? It feels really weird\u2026? \n\n3. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m the third man in the relationship. We were talking about going away for my birthday; Toms birthday is 2 days before mine and \u201coh but then I can\u2019t see Tom on his birthday\u201d I said that\u2019s fine, you can see him the day before? She seemed upset. The other night, Tom was round hers after work. I said do they want to come to the coast. She said no because her & Tom were having a Chinese with her parents later but we could meet for a walk for a bit. After, her and Tom went back for the chinese with her parents and I had to go home on my own. My sister was shocked she didn\u2019t just invite me to join too, it very much felt like they were the relationship item, and I was the third wheel. \n\nYesterday, we almost split because she didnt like that I felt uncomfortable about Tom and would never sacrifice her friendship - I never asked her to, I only said I have a boundary on sharing the bed and that it made me uncomfortable, but that I wouldn\u2019t stop her regardless, she just knows how I feel. She actually said she understood this and agreed when we discussed it. Now she wants to hold off on booking my birthday away and a holiday we were planning and wants to take things slow, no longer wants something \u2018serious\u2019 yet but she\u2019s happy where we\u2019re at - basically if I said will you be my girlfriend right now, she\u2019d say no. \n\nYes, the dude is gay, but she\u2019s said how if he was straight he\u2019d be the perfect partner, and I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be the 3rd person in the relationship. I believe it\u2019s important your partner has to be prioritised as number 1. \n\nAm I the arsehole?", "created_utc": 1693982126, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bcslq/aita_for_having_boundaries_even_with_her_gay/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But she takes Tom to dinner with the parents, is going on a romantic weekend with Tom, says he's the perfect partner except he's gay and he's more important to her than you are.

Which, tbf, at the beginning of a relationship I think it's fair that your actual friends are more important than your romantic partner - as you never know quite how long you'll be dating them whereas your actual friends will likely be in your life for a long time. \n\nThat said, at some point that needs to switch. When you get serious about a relationship, your partner should become your first priority, above all other relationships in your life. It sounds like you are already at that point, whereas your girlfriend clearly isn't. I think it's smart to have a conversation about that, and see if you can get to be on the same page. If she isn't ready yet or expects to never be ready to make you more of a priority, and you feel like this needs to be the case from now on, then splitting up is probably your best bet. However, if she feels like you're not together long enough right now but she expects to be there after 6 months or a year, for example, then you could consider whether that's worth it to you.", "NTA.\n\nHer relationship with this guy goes back years, while you\u2019ve only known her a couple of months.

Just because your relationship is romantic and sexual doesn't mean it automatically supersedes all the longer platonic relationships in her life which are equally as important and meaningful. Accept that she has other people she cares about and makes meaningful commitments to if you want to keep dating her. \n\nAlso, as a side note, it's understandable that you feel uncomfortable if your partner is sharing a bed with someone else. But I see a lot of talk about 'boundaries' being used these days in ways that are very unhelpful. It's good to chat about relationship expectations, but you don't set a 'boundary' around someone else's behaviour: boundaries are something you set for yourself ('if X happens, I will do Y'). What you're talking about is creating rules that the other person has to follow. Not quite the same thing and that can be a slippery slope to controlling behaviour. I'm not saying you are being controlling in this instance, but something to think about for the future.", "I would be worried too, it seems like she loves gay men.
