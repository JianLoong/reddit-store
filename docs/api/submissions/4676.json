After that, I have 2 ideas to share with you\n\n1. Respect is a two-way street. Respect is reciprocal in relationships where both parties value each other and want to interact to their mutual benefit. It would appear that your friend doesn't have enough respect for you to accept you as you are. Nor does she respect you enough to simply *not lie to you*. \"I knew you wouldn't come\" indicates that she's convinced she's the only one in the relationship with enough brains to make the right decisions - in her view you're clearly incapable of making good decisions as you continue to make the wrong decision (you're not choosing god).\n2. Concepts and beliefs merit consideration, not respect. There's a huge difference between a person and the beliefs they hold, it's important to understand the difference. I'm happy being respectful to the people around me, but there's nothing wrong with questioning, analyzing, considering, assessing, making fun of, and critiquing beliefs. She is doing this with your beliefs, but seems unimpressed when you do the same to her beliefs. Why is this?\n\nPeople can get their feelings hurt if we treat them poorly (harsh words, insults). Beliefs have no feelings- you can't insult beliefs. You have tried to speak to your friend in a polite and less aggressive way, but she refused to accept your words. That's on her, and she is the one who put you in a position where you had to be more forceful in order to try to get your point across.\n\nThis one is entirely on her.", "NTA I also have lots of Christian friends and I have been invited to all of their churches at least once.

As a born again Pagan, who has had Christianity pushed on them forever, I can empathize with you.  In my quest on my spiritual path I explored Christianity, I went to several churches and I even read the Bible cover to cover.
