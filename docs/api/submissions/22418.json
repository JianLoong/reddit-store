This is a heartbreaking situation, but your mothers actions cannot be allowed to disrupt your life and that of your family.  You have already done more than most is trying to fix your mother's mistakes.", "NTA BUT look at all the possibilities. Ask if you can get qualified as a foster parent and then have her as your foster child. Foster parents can get reimbursed for a lot of things including day care, plus they get paid (not nearly enough!) for being foster parents. As long as you don\u2019t adopt her, she is entitled to some benefits as a foster kid. Also, you qualify for respite care as well.", "NTA.  You are doing the right thing to consider this option.

Is the extra stress worth a child being put into a likely abusive situation? Some foster kids end up doing well, but many do not.\n\nOne thing to consider is whether or not you are eligible for compensation as her foster parent. This might take enough of the burden off to make it worth it. \n\nThere also might be scholarships for the kiddo to attend daycare. \n\nYou might have luck with crowd funding.\n\nIt's worth looking into if you are still on the fence and finances are the main concern, but you are not obligated to take care of a child that is not yours, even if they are related to your kids.

Tough call but you must do what is best for your family first.", "NTA. It's a terrible situation but you are not responsible for caring for a child just because of a tertiary relationship.

If the only reason you aren't confident in welcoming the child into your home is financial, they CAN help. It may be a lot of paperwork, but it is possible.\n\nCPS wants to keep family members together, even if they're only half siblings.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of resources that can help lower income families. CPS has information on that. Please talk to them about what they can help you with (even if you decide not to take her in as well, they have programs that can help with your own kids).", "Can you register as a foster parent so you can get the foster stipend?", "Depends where you at. In Texas, kinship placements get a stipend, and you qualify for food stamps. Other states may not be that generous. \nThe key is you save only the ones you can. The state can find a good foster home and you get visits to ensure she\u2019s taken care of well.", "NTA. Could you ask CPS if you could get licensed as a foster parent and get paid to foster your niece?", "NAH. \n\nPlease weigh your options, though. You have every right to refuse to take her in. Your kids also may never forgive you for allowing their sister to be enrolled in foster care. Especially if she endures any kind of abuse there.", "Ask them (CPS) for help, ask for what programs you can get to get help with keeping her with you. They should have different types of help.", "This is a great suggestion! It\u2019s my understanding foster parents do get stipends for the children that come into their home.", "Yes, as neither of you is related to the child, maybe you can be the permanent foster parents and be paid for raising her.", "You can become a foster parent.  Stipend is usually $900 or so a month in my state, pays for daycare, and a small yearly clothing allowance.  It may take a few months.", "I\u2019m in the US and had custody/ foster care of my niece and nephews. Because we were family, they took our income into account ( he was an E5 military and I was SAHM), we didn\u2019t get any assistance. I think it was just that state tho, cause they suck lol", "Sadly, it\u2019s also in the older childrens\u2019s best interest for this little girl to be placed elsewhere. Not only do the eldest daughter feel she has to parent this child but the bio mother\u2019s attempts to get her back jeopardise the older child\u2019s stability. Perhaps she can be placed somewhere that the op and her family can keep contact.", "Probably not, but they could get qualified as foster parents fairly quickly and then they would be reimbursed for a lot of her care. Depends on the county and state.", "This is the answer OP.  You are simply not in the position to do any more.  This is on your mother.", "It\u2019s not on OP\u2019s mother. It\u2019s on the bio mother of the girls/OP\u2019s husband\u2019s ex.", "So they lose half of their household income and have even more trouble taking care of all the kids?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t agree with not parentifying kids, but this seemed like a temporary situation in another hard situation.", "from what i\u2019ve been told they do, and if adoption is something they are interested in they\u2019ll revive an adoption check to cover the extra expenses of another child", "Friend, are you in the US? If so, a few things. It differs by state, but there are generally two types of legal statuses that allow someone to be the temporary caregiver of a child who has been taken away from their parents. One is being a foster parent; the other is being a kinship guardian (name can vary by state, but basically a relative who doesn't have a formal foster license).\n\nYOU CAN GET FINANCIAL SUPPORT WITH EITHER OF THESE. The fastest route, again depending on your state, is to stay a kinship guardian - but for my state at least you could get a little over $600/month from the state in food support for the child.\n\nThis does not include connecting with non-profits in the area that may exist to further support foster parents and kinship guardians, and can often help out with the GOODS that you might need to make a space in your home / help her out on an ongoing basis (clothes, backpack, school supplies, etc.)\n\nI'm not in any way saying that you are an AH if you don't take her in, but if it's money alone that's holding you back, know that support is available!!!\n\nPlease feel free to PM me to discuss further. And ask CPS if the child can be assigned a CASA or a guardian ad litem. The social worker should have heard of at least one of these.", "When you talk with CPS, be honest and tell them that you would need financing and protection from biomom if you were to do this.  If they can't help with that, then they will need to find another placement.  \n\nYour heart is in the right place, you just need to be responsible and put your family first.", "Yes", "Tell them you need cash to take care of them ptoperly.", "You need to talk to the foster agency. They will provide  daily stipend and may have access to childcare resource as well.", "Talk to CPS about your financial situation and ask if there is any assistance available if you take her in more permanently. What would it take for you to officially be her \"foster\" parent?", "You are not an awful person for having a child who is not yours who you cannot afford go into foster. But please try to keep contact between your girls and their sister. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou might consider talking to a social worker about getting funding for the children, or see if you qualify for something. Maybe see if you can somehow become foster parents (there are usually classes required for this, but they can often be scheduled for evenings) and get some money to care for her. Perhaps a form of child support from the bio dads of these kids? \n\nThe bottom line is, if you can't do it, you can't do it. If nothing else, maybe the fosters can be convinced to allow visitation, or maybe some overnights during holidays and such. It's a horrible situation to be in, be kinder to yourself.", "Technically you and your husband are not a relative but are for her siblings. If the daughter is a ward of the court and they place her with you. You should qualify for a stipend and child care voucher. Ask what all your financial support would be from the state before making a decision. Ultimately your family needs come first, but it a tough decision to be made.", "So my sister in law lost custody of her kids, and her parents were awarded custody. They became foster parents to foster their grandchildren instead of guardian ship because the mother didn't want any of this. The state helps pay for daycare and or helps provide for the kids finances. \nI don't know if this is something you would consider, you could choose to only foster her. \n\nNta if you can't do it, you can't. I got my tubes removed for the same reasons. And I don't know if I could take any nieces or nephews in finacialy", "NTA. Very sad situation. What if bio mom keeps having babies?  I'm sorry for everyone involved here.", "NTA but if finances are your main concern, ask CPS about resources.  I work for Social Services and people can get benefits in situations like this where you get benefits for the child only.  I don't know where you're located but in my state (California), CPS will get you childcare.  People who take in foster kids typically also get a stipend to help support the kiddo.", "NTA if you can't get government assistance to help out with her, don't put the other kids in jeopardy for her sake. Your kids come first, make the right decision for them", "My husband isn't the oldest's biological father & he got temporary custody of her over a similar situation with bio mom. He has never received anything ever for her, but maybe things have changed. I'll ask the worker tomorrow.", "No, you have to become a certified foster in order to get assistance. My wife and I just took in her cousins 5 children and we get absolutely no help from the state. And to top it off I lost my job in April and just recently found a job delivering pizzas for now until I can find something better.", "In my area, there are also nonprofits who can help foster parents get clothes, furniture, etc for the kiddo. Wouldn't hurt to check into it!\n\nI also think foster parents can receive SNAP for their foster kids, to help offset the cost of food.", "This a million times. If the issue is financial the agency will have options for you. Please please explain to the social worker. They\u2019ll likely pay for the daycare as well.", "Yes! And there are also daycare vouchers for foster kids!", "Agreed on this, I work solely with relative and kinship care providers for children in foster care. Most states offer a stipend per day that pays out like a job every two weeks; it's not a lot but it helps. Also many states pay for childcare for children in state custody, but the hard part is finding a provider with an opening.", "Depends heavy on where you live but always worth looking into", "Yes, ask the worker.  It's possible this is a difference situation or he might have been eligible for more than he got.", "This is possible in most states if you are willing to become a licensed foster home. But once the question of permanency comes up - permanent legal guardianship or adoption in order to close the case out after parental rights are terminated - the stipend would end. Source: I used to work for CPS in a Midwest state.", "Where I live even if a relative is fostering they get a stipend. This isn\u2019t forever, obviously, eventually the goal is to go back to the parent (if safe) or be adopted. \n\nA friend had her sister\u2019s children for a year while her sister went through a difficult time.", "Unfortunately many areas are bad at informing relative guardians of the financial support they are eligible to apply for.", "It\u2019s highly dependent on what state you live in. I\u2019ve supervised a family placement that got a stipend, SNAP, and free childcare. OP your best bet is to talk to the social worker assigned to the case, and if they\u2019re not helpful ask for a guardian ad Litem. You may have options.", "But many places allow you to be approved as a foster parent just for the individual placement (esp if it will be long term).", "In some states, foster children are eligible for Medicaid.", "Oh yeah I know. Tbh, they may have even been wrong, they definitely were some of the worst social workers I ever saw.", "I'm sorry you didn't receive the support you should have.", "It\u2019s definitely ok! We made it work, the community had food banks (which we qualified for income wise. Weird?lol) and other church programs and such for food and clothing. The community itself was AMAZING!"]}
