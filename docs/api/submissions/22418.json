If so, a few things. It differs by state, but there are generally two types of legal statuses that allow someone to be the temporary caregiver of a child who has been taken away from their parents. One is being a foster parent; the other is being a kinship guardian (name can vary by state, but basically a relative who doesn't have a formal foster license).\n\nYOU CAN GET FINANCIAL SUPPORT WITH EITHER OF THESE. The fastest route, again depending on your state, is to stay a kinship guardian - but for my state at least you could get a little over $600/month from the state in food support for the child.\n\nThis does not include connecting with non-profits in the area that may exist to further support foster parents and kinship guardians, and can often help out with the GOODS that you might need to make a space in your home / help her out on an ongoing basis (clothes, backpack, school supplies, etc.)\n\nI'm not in any way saying that you are an AH if you don't take her in, but if it's money alone that's holding you back, know that support is available!!!\n\nPlease feel free to PM me to discuss further. And ask CPS if the child can be assigned a CASA or a guardian ad litem. The social worker should have heard of at least one of these.", "When you talk with CPS, be honest and tell them that you would need financing and protection from biomom if you were to do this.

You may be eligible for SNAP for the entire family, WIC for any children under 5, day care assistance, etc.  Please ask. \n\nIf you do not believe you can provide a safe and loving home for the child, you are NTA for saying so.  But if you can, and you just need help?  The case worker will do their best to help.", "This is a hard spot to be in and no matter what you choose your doing the best you can x", "You do know that the state will help you take care of her why are you even considering putting that cold into the system so your kids will always look at you sideways for not caring", "NTA but yikes this is a horrible situation!\n\nMoney: you literally got your tubes tied because you couldn't afford another kid. Does your location offer kinship care? If so become foster parents and you should get a stipend for all the kids that aren't legally yours? Would the stipend make a difference? If the above happened and you have kinship care of the youngest (and oldest who is also not you or your hubby's kid) should have Medicaid, etc and the stipend should help cover a lot of her costs. Caseworks and others on her case should be able to help with stuff as well. There are a lot of resources you may not know about? Before and after school programs, etc. Maybe you can get daycare for free if she's in the foster system?\n\nWith that being said, I would personally do everything I could to keep this child. \n\nIf you can't, don't feel guilty. Kinship care is 1000x harder than just fostering since you have those familial ties to the Biomom, especially with her being an addict. If you can't keep her  I would recommend you do any and everything you can to keep her in the \"family.\" Sleepovers, play dates, dinner, etc.", "NTA.  \n\nBut your daughters will be harmed by watching their sister go into foster care.  If there is any way you could take the child, your daughters will be blessed.", "NTA Have you considered getting approved to foster her? We had friends who did that recently. It was a pretty invasive process but, like you, they didn\u2019t want the kid to suffer (not maligning the foster system but it is traumatic to get removed from your home) for her mom\u2019s actions.", "Foster parents who are not related are paid to cover the child's expenses. Those who are related get paid in some places under kinship care agreements.", "No. It\u2019s not on OP\u2019s mother. OP\u2019s mother didn\u2019t cause her daughter\u2019s husband\u2019s ex to do anything. It\u2019s all on the little girl\u2019s mother.", "NTA. Very sad situation. What if bio mom keeps having babies? I'm sorry for everyone involved here.", "If money is that tight you may qualify for daycare assistance, food, etc\u2026 even for your own kids. Check into it and talk to the cps rep for referrals", "In reality... It's not up to anyone on the Internet. Please sit down and have a full convo about this with your husband."]}
