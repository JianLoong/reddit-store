If he has a problem with who you choose to walk you down the aisle, that says more about him than it does about anyone else. Stick to your guns and have your brother by your side on YOUR special day.", "NTA\n\nNo clue what's going on with him, and his excuses make no sense at all.", "NTA but pay attention to how your fiance handles this. It may give you more information to work with, in deciding if he is really someone to marry.", "NTA. i am sure your brother would be proud to walk you down the isle. if its family and friends why would anyone make fun of him? i agree as the bride it is up to you who gives you away ( walks you down the isle)", "Definitely NTA. Your Fiance on the other hand.", "NTA. This is exactly how we modernize the sexism out of the ceremony.  In Olden Days the bargain (worst case description) was between whatever male had rights over you and whatever male was purchasing those rights.  For you to take the \u201cgiving away\u201d and make it into \u201cHere\u2019s where I am coming from\u2026 this is my best representation of the family and history I\u2019m bringing to this moment\u201d instead of it just being someone who is entitled to give you away \u2026 that is magic.  Let your groom make choices for his side of the aisle.  If he is unwilling to back off of your freedom to choose your side, rethink/rehash what this marriage will be like.", "NTA. He doesn't  have a issue with your brother. He has a issue with other people seeing your brother. Everyone wants to be cool. Your brother is not cool. If your brother was a celebrity he would have no problem with it & would probably insist. This is just how humans operate unfortunately.", "NTA having your brother walk you down the aisle is sweet.  There is nothing wrong with it and it wouldn\u2019t take attention from anyone.  If people can\u2019t treat him with respect they don\u2019t need to be there.", "NTA because you control the bride's party and he controls the groom's so you get to choose who has the honour of walking you down the aisle.\n\nI did be more worried about your fianc\u00e9 being embarrassed by your brother....what a doosh bag.", "NTA. This will be a feel good moment for your guests seeing you honor your relationship with your brother. \n\nYou need to discuss your brother\u2019s disability further with your fianc\u00e9. If your brother doesn\u2019t get meltdowns, being overwhelmed should be the only concern\u2014that your brother can enjoy the wedding. His concerns are otherwise insulting.\n\nNow to ask who will walk your mother into the ceremony? Will it be your uncles\u2014her brothers? That has a charming symmetry.", "NTA\nBoth your day or not it is up to you who walks you down the aisle! Having your brother do it is very sweet. I would be talking to my fianc\u00e9 about the issues with my brother.", "NTA at all, but I would have concerns about this relationship.", "NTA. I find the whole walk the bride down the aisle somewhat archaic, but if you do it I'd say you as the bride get to decide who will be alongside you.", "NTA\n\n>When discussing plans for the wedding I told my partner I wanted my big brother (40M) to walk me down. My Partner immediately stated he didn't want that as it'd take away attention from us and perhaps lead to people making fun of my brother who has Down's syndrome. He told me I should just have my Mum walk me down the aisle instead.\n\nWow. Just wow. What an awful thing to say to you about your brother and your guests. No one will \"make fun\" of your brother. I don't know how to process such a vile statement.", "NTA, and your fiancee has a problem.", "NTA, and apparently your fiance is quite ableist. It wouldn't be all that wrong of you to kick him out of the wedding for what he said about your brother (half joking, but please seriously think about the fact that he sees disability as a grab for attention)", "NTA. You aren\u2019t yet married and legally attached to this man. You should prioritize making sure he doesn\u2019t have a problem with your brother before the wedding. What happens if your brother needs your support after you get married and your husband decides you shouldn\u2019t? Will he attempt to steer you away from your relationship with your brother? Why is this a thing he\u2019s getting worked up about? You get to choose who walks you down the aisle for sure. But, this situation requires you learn more before getting married to this person- for your own wellbeing.", "NTA\n\nAnd if he sees your brother walking you down the aisle is an embarrassment, *call it off* and consider yourself to have dodged a bullet.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 sure is. The fact that it isn\u2019t that he\u2019s your brother, but that he thinks that his having Downs Syndrome will take away attention and cause people to make fun of him is your fianc\u00e9 revealing his true colors and how he really feels about your brother. As a parent of an autistic child I may be biased but this makes him ableist , non inclusive and someone I would never consider family (I already said the AH part but it bears repeating). You have some thinking to do on how you want to address this with your fianc\u00e9. I can see why you didn\u2019t tell your family what he said.", "NTA", "Trying to sweep aside brothers existence as much as he can.", "While I think this is her decision, it absolutely is THEIR wedding, not just hers.", "Exactly, I would not hesitate in kicking anyone out who so much as looked at him the wrong way. I just am so confused by his resistance to this.", "I honestly don't either, I don't want anyone but my Brother to walk me down the aisle and him stating that makes me even more set on this. I would have never even considered what he said so I don't know why he would.", "\\^\\^This. Is your brother able to live independently now, or is your mother his primary care giver? If your mother is his primary care giver, would your husband support you wanting to be be his primary care given once your mother is gone? This needs to be discussed before you are married.\n\nedited for missing word", "I\u2019d be pausing the wedding until you find out why he think it\u2019s ok to disrespect your brother like this. He\u2019s the one looking at your brother the wrong way.", "Seems like he\u2019s feeling insecure about your brothers disability.  My sad guess is he\u2019s afraid of what others will think.  Possibly thinks he\u2019ll get judged because of it too.  Which is just wrong.  Time for an honest heart to heart conversation.", "Is he getting family pressure? In which case he needs to grow a spine and stand up for your brother. If he can\u2019t do that, then you know what your married life will be like.", "I can't believe anyone would say something like that to anyone about their sibling but for your fiance to say it you, that's awful. My first thought was how sweet not let's lock your brother in the basement.", "Our Mum is his primary care giver and I am going to be his caregiver if our Mum passes before him or becomes unable to continue to care for him. This is something my partner is aware of and never had any issue with which is why this take from him has taken me by surprise.", "He *absolutely* has an issue with it. He just doesn't plan for you to find out until *after* you marry him and he thinks you're stuck.\n\nThere is *zero* chance this man is going to be good to or allow you to care for your brother.", "Glad this is something you had discussed, and yes, I can see why this has taken you by surprise then. \n\nPlease do walk down the aisle with your brother. There's of course many choices within a wedding that can/should have input from both the bride and groom, but this isn't one of them. I don't imagine he wanted input into who his best man should be?"]}
