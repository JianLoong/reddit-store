As a parent of an autistic child I may be biased but this makes him ableist , non inclusive and someone I would never consider family (I already said the AH part but it bears repeating).

Stupid thing for your fiance to have an issue with.", "NTA. There are parts of a wedding that really are one person's call, who walks the bride down the aisle is the bride's call. \n\nI don't know why he thinks anyone would care if its your brother walking you down the aisle. I honestly never really notice who's walking with the bride. It's about 30 seconds of the ceremony.", "NTA.  I would reconsider this relationship as his attitude toward your brother's disability is ableist and rude.  He needs to give concrete reasons why your brother shouldn't be in the wedding.  His rationale that the attention will be taken off you and onto your brother resulting in people making fun of him shows that he is ashamed of your brother.  Have  a LONG conversation about your brother and his involvement in your life after marriage.", "Your fianc\u00e9 is embarrassed to be associated with your brother.  He\u2019s the one you should be kicking out of your wedding.  NTA", "You need to dig into this more. I think it is 'embarrassing' to him that your brother's Down Syndrome will 'be on display' at the wedding instead of trying to hide it. Just a guess, but this is important. Most grooms have little strong feeling about ANY wedding decisions and this is the hill he is trying to die on? Something is happening here. I think having your brother walk you down the aisle sounds sweet, if this is a tradition you want to honor.", "NTA - it's a sweet and lovely gesture.", "NTA. And I would rethink this wedding", "So you are kicking your fianc\u00e9 out of the wedding right? He is discriminating against your brother. Ask him how long he has hated  people with special needs.

Everybody else is a backup singer and you are the star of the show.  The bride is the Queen.  If you want your brother to walk you down the aisle then that\u2019s what you get.  And that\u2019s all there is to it.   That being said, I would talk a long hard look at how your future husband looks at your brother.   Is he somehow embarrassed by him? Threatened?  This is a red flag popping up.", "NTA you decide who walks you down the aisle. \n\nbut you need to find out if your fiancee is making comments about your brother when you are not around.  Because this leads me to believe that he is not the same person when you are not around.  And that is not ok.  What has he said in your brother's company that may have been inappropriate.", "NTA - of course you get to choose who walks you down the aisle. Your partner's response to this is worrying, though - I'd nip this in the bud before getting married. If this is his attitude towards your brother (and folks with Downs syndrome) then you all need to work this through before getting hitched.", "Rethink your choice of spouse.  NTA", "NTA. However, this would be a dealbreaker for me. If he can't let you do something that makes you happy for fear of how it looks, you are going to have bigger issues down the road.", "NTA, and WTF, Partner? Sounds like someone has issues with your brother being seen by others.", "My dad will almost certainly pass before I get married and I plan on having my brother walk me down the aisle as well, he has downs too. If my future spouse has an issue with that then they should marry someone else. No one who I would ever invite to my wedding would make fun of my brother. If my spouse's family has issues with disabled folks then my spouse can deal with them.", "NTA I recommend resolving this issue before you marry. The issue being why your fianc\u00e9 thinks that your brother draws too much attention and is embarrassing.", "This includes your fianc\u00e9 I\u2019m afraid", "I usually think people overreact over things on Reddit and say immediately relationship over, but this is a fucking giant waving red flag with alarm bells going off and some kind of smoke coming out of somewhere.", "Yeah without knowing where on the scale they are my only concern ever with something like this would be how do they react / handle high pressure or center of attention scenarios. Having them being in a situation where they may ended up being very overwhelmed isn't fair to anyone. But I would hope that op making this decision they know their brother will be perfectly fine. If their partner brought up something about op underestimating when their brother gets overwhelmed I would understand his concern. But they brought up that they think he will get made fun of, making me think he has family already making jokes or comments about the brother.", "Um...... if it isn't her partner's wedding.... exacly who is she getting married to.....????\n\n<insert facepalm emoji here>", "It\u2019s not just her special day it\u2019s also his. She is NTA but he is and your comment regarding that is ridiculous.", "Your fianc\u00e9 is looking at him the wrong way. \n\n\nHe is prioritizing potential ableists over your brother.", "Sadly it might be the groom who needs to be kicked out of the wedding. Does he accept that your brother will be living with you if something happens to your mother? He said ok now but does he think he can change your mind after you are married? Has he had issues with your brother that you haven\u2019t noticed or have brushed aside? \n\nYou and he have to have a serious conversation about your future. Let him know your brother will always be in your life, and walking you down the aisle is your public acknowledgment of this. If he can\u2019t handle this now, he won\u2019t be able to handle this when your brother lives with you.\n\nAnd what about children if you plan to have them? There is a beautiful video of a man\u2019s son and his relationship with his DS brother. Uncle and nephew have been best buddies since the son was born, and he has filmed them as the boy grew. Make sure your fianc\u00e9 knows your brother will uncle to your kids and will be seen in public with them all their lives. \n\nPlease post an update. Either your fianc\u00e9 accepts your brother or he doesn\u2019t, but you need to know before the wedding.", "Who does he think will \"make fun\" of your brother? I'm going to guess that no one in your family or friends will be saying anything negative about him. They all know your brother and care about him. Anyone who had the potential to \"make fun\" of him will not be at the wedding. (I'm speculating here, but you don't strike me as the type of person who would invite someone to your wedding who doesn't love your brother.)\n\nSo who is left? It's his side. His family and friends. He is worried that *someone he is close to* will have a problem with your brother. You need to figure out whose opinion matters more to him than your own, and then uninvite that person from the wedding. And if he's not willing to take that step, then you'll know where you stand.", "My thoughts exactly. This is in no way a bridezilla thing.", "I  interpreted that as his family are ableist and he doesn't want anything there that will set them off.", "You know the stories about how dad's new fiance was so nice, and the minute the ring went on it was hell until 18?  And now dad and the kids haven't talked since because stepmom demands an apology?\n\nIt sounds just possibly like a variant of that story might be about to happen to your family.", "I had an aunt with serious intellectual disabilities.

Long time ago, I was dating someone who said \u201cnone of my money would ever go to care for her\u201d. I dumped him soon after.

He will make you choose between him and your brother.
