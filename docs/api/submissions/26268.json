My sister (35F) is going through a really rough time. She got evicted from her apartment where she lives with her 3 children. Her ex, who's the father of the kids, wasn't good to her, and she's dealing with anxiety and bouts of depression from past traumas.\n\nThe situation is even more challenging because her former apartment was in an awful state - dirty furniture, moldy and wet carpets, clogged toilets and sinks, and all-around poor condition due to her three young kids. She lost her apartment because she fell behind on rent after quitting her job since she couldn't find suitable childcare.\n\nI want to help, but the last time she stayed with me, it left my place in bad shape, and I lost my security deposit. I do have some space in my home, but I'm not sure if I can handle the responsibility of caring for 3 small children right now. I'm torn between wanting to be there for her and worrying about my own well-being and our relationship.\n\nFor the last month, my mother and I have been funding my sister and kids stay in an extended stay but it's becoming to much for both of us to keep doing.\n\nI really don't feel comfortable having all of them in my house. I have actually been growing angry because my sister is relying on my mother and I to support her but it\u2019s overwhelming shelling out so much money. It isn\u2019t a situation that we created but it frustrating that my sisters position has gotten so bad that it\u2019s hard to support her.\n\nI want to maintain certain boundaries but I feel that it\u2019s just not going to get better and the kids may have to live either in foster care or go with their dads until she can get her life together.\n \nAITA for not allowing them to stay with me?", "created_utc": 1693924585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16apyxq/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_and_her_kids_live/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve tried moving her in before, it didn\u2019t work.. She needs to grow up a bit and get help for her own issues.", "Absolutely do not let her and the children move in with you.  You allowed her before and she ruined your place and cost you money.  Your sister needs to reach out for any public assistance including job training and daycare resources. This is not on you and your mother anymore.  Your assistance cannot sustain her and her children\u2019s lives. Your sister needs to do that.\n\nNTA \nEdit for judgement", "NTA;  Based on what you have described - you would effectively be committing to providing housing/support for them all long term.  After all - once she is with you, what's going to change from when she had a place, but couldn't afford it because she couldn't work?", "NTA. Sister needs to get her stuff straight and stop expecting you and mom to keep bailing her out. If the dads are 'safe' for the kids, it would make sense to send them there while sister gets back on her feet. Dragging them along through all this isn't helpful to anyone.", "NTA.  You saw how she left your place the last time she was there.  She hasn't changed. She's literally being evicted, at least partially, for how she treated the place she lived in. And  you say you can't handle caring for three children right now - *which means you assume you will be caring for them if they move in, instead of their mother.*  Nope.  This is a no go.  If you let them in, they'll never leave, and they'll destroy your home and peace of mind in the process.   \n\nLook, I know you want to help, but....at some point, she has to face the music.  You don't mention how long she's been struggling, but there isn't a time limit on responsibility.  If she can't support those kids, she can't keep depending on family to do her favors indefinitely.  You and your Mom are at the end of your financial rope.  It's her turn. **She** has to do what she needs to do to get back on her feet.  She needs to do the work to either get a job or get help.  There are a lot of government agencies all over and local charities that absolutely can get her going in the right direction. **But SHE has to do the work and find them, get signed up, and use that help.**   She can't just throw her hands up and expect someone else to care for her and her children. And unfortunately, that might mean the kids have to go in the system for a while.  But, that's not necessarily permanent.  It may be the kick in the butt she needs to get her act together.", "NTA I wouldn't let her move in. If she asks, just tell her you can't afford it. I would also put an end date to giving her money. Tell her you can do another 2 months and then she'll have to figure something out.", "Nta your sister is using you. If you let her move in you u will regret it. You will have to evict her.\n\nIt\u2019s time you set your sister down and tell her she has a month to get a job and a place to live.

It\u2019s time for some tough love. \n\nIf you let her move in. She will destroy your home.

It sounds like she has issues with finances, childcare, and general adulting. She needs guidance if she\u2019s going to manage a home of her own. \n\nIt\u2019s time to contact professionals who can help. If you\u2019re in the US, you can dial 211 to get hooked up with the appropriate charities. They can help.", "NTA\n\nIt amazes me how adults that have multiple children depend on other adults to support them.  Your sister needs to look for public assistance if it available in your area.  She won't make her kids be civil, and keep her home tidy, she will destroy yours also.  \n\nI would be kind, but firm, I'm sorry sister, I love you, but you will have to find help somewhere else in 30 days, I can't afford to continue to support you.

She can too.", "NTA. As an adult who has also had to worry about adult siblings - it\u2019s exhausting. The children are who need care and looked after.

My 2 years old understands that we only can play football inside with soft balls and if she draws on walls there are consequences like crayons taken etc. Mold? Wtf?", "NTA. It's a tough situation but you have to think about you and your financial situation first sometimes, even more if you want to keep helping her. You could try to compromise but, no matter what you do, don't let the kids go to their father, specially if he was physically abusive.", "NTA\n\nWouldn't it be easier to help her arrange childcare so she can work?", "NTA and your sister needs to apply for assistance and other social services. You and your mother can not continue to financially support her and you should absolutely NOT let them stay with you.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, have you come up with a solution? Like a list of daily choresso the place stays clean? Structure might also be benefical to her mental heath.", "Oof that's tough... Not the asshole for not wanting her kids to wreck your house, or have to take care of 3 kids yourself (you didn't sign up for that). I totally understand that...  \nBut also, you could be doing more then just throwing money at the problem. Your sister needs help, not just funding. Depression and anxiety can be debilitating and she's having to take care of three kids on her own after being in an abusive relationship it sounds like? Damn, I'm depressed myself and just thinking about me in that situation and I'd find it hard not to hang rope. That's a tough spot. You could be helping her by looking into assistance programs, local support groups, charities, etc who can help.

This sounds like he11 to me. Can you preemptively draw up some reasonable boundaries in a contract so that your sister understands you can't help her if she doesn't hold up her end and manage her kids?\n\nHas she asked the county about emergency resources for housing and food for her family?", "NTA- Her situation sounds terrible but if she stayed with you in the past and it caused you to lose your security deposit, its unfair for you to have to sacrifice more again. Not to mention you HAVE been helping her out financially. \n\nIf I were you, once again you dont owe her this, I would set strict ground rules about her living with you and try it out for just a week.

Trashed her own apartment, left yours in bad shape, costing you your SD. Bad track record which suggest how it will go if they move in.", "NTA.  And why the mom amd kids always suffer when the other partner skips out.  Think of \u201cmom\u201d as any gender.", "NTA. Your sister needs to find her own solution", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is going to have to dig really deep to work her own way out of this hole, but you and your mother can't keep this up indefinitely. I would not allow her to stay with me based on your previous experience with her and how she handled her home on her own.\n\nOP, there is more than one way to help people. And sometimes that's not the way they would prefer for you to help them. Often times, they want help that directly inconveniences or causes sacrifice to the person they're asking rather than to do what is necessary on their end to change their circumstances. I don't recommend any course of action that will cause you to ultimately have to change your whole lifestyle in order to cater to her.\n\nTo assist her, I would recommend that she contact local non-profits/charities because some do help to fund daycare in total or partially (if in the U.S., a non-profit called Family Guidance Center or even Catholic Charities may be able to help). In the meantime, if the father of the children (or willing family members of his) has a place to stay, she will need to place the children with him over foster care. Again, the daycare assistance would be available to either of them. Whatever work shift the father has, she can apply for work on an opposite shift from him so that they both become responsible for the care of their children. Depending on the area she lives in, she may qualify for Section 8 housing assistance (though there may be a longer wait for this) and food stamps to feed her children. There are even non-profits that assist with utility bills. Your sister is going to need to call around to every single agency that she can in order to change her situation. That's on her and it's not up to you or your mom to mitigate her life issues.", "NTA they can stay with your mom as your sister needs to teach them manners.", "NTA - She trashed your house last time and that eliminates your responisbility now.", "Question: Was the reason she couldn't find child care because the kids were so out of control?", "NTA", "Send her womens shelter information", "Pay for her rent or house her and step up with the chores. Kids are a handful, but deal with it. They're family. Shit happens. Hold her accountable too though.", "NTA. Why can't she stay with OP's mother?  If OP continues to help her sister, she'll never work because she's being financially supported.  OP, It's a no- win situation, so do what's required to save yourself.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your home, not hers, and you know she'll (along with the kids) trash it.  She needs a job and child care, and child support from the ex.  Even have the kids stay with the ex if it's a safe situation and he's got partial custody, they're his too after all.  In any case, it's not your responsibility to support her or pay for her poor life choices.  Cut off the financial support and keep firm on no housing.", "Ok im mixed here, but i think its because family first in my mind.   My bro has lived with me a few times and is a complete mooch.   I feel if you let her stay she need major rules and a contract.  She needs a job and a schedule for childcare to get one her feet as well as applying for hud or section 8.  That's not saying you need to do this, its just an idea because no one wants these kids in the system or with an abusive father", "> she fell behind on rent after quitting her job since she couldn't find suitable childcare.\n\nThat was smart /s", "Yeah, that\u2019s something I am doing. I rewrote her resume. She has always been great at her jobs but doesn\u2019t always talk about it well. I\u2019m helping her with that.", "No, the reason was because she has a hard time trusting someone to watch them. Our family is not large enough or close geographically for family to so.", "...you rewrote her resume....I mean...good first step I guess?   \n\n\nI'm meaning you taking an afternoon at the very least, looking up all the different assistance programs she could utilize, correlating a list of names and numbers she can call, walk her through calling them or calling them yourself with her there to fill in the blanks, making her appointments, setting up a calender for her, etc. That sort of help. When you have depression it can be hard to even get out of bed. When you have anxiety issues, it is hard as hell to pick up the phone and talk to strangers.   \nYou just redoing her resume is like me asking you to help me clean out and organize the garage for a garage sale, but instead you go and do yardwork and paint the fence. I mean, it'll make it prettier for the sale, but it didn't actually help the core issue at all", "The goal really was to ensure she had at least a good start to finding a job. It\u2019s apart of the boundaries I have right now. I want to help her be productive. Using my network to help with the job search and help her with resumes and interviewing is something I\u2019m naturally good at."]}
