Trashed her own apartment, left yours in bad shape, costing you your SD. Bad track record which suggest how it will go if they move in.", "NTA.  And why the mom amd kids always suffer when the other partner skips out.  Think of \u201cmom\u201d as any gender.", "NTA. Your sister needs to find her own solution", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is going to have to dig really deep to work her own way out of this hole, but you and your mother can't keep this up indefinitely. I would not allow her to stay with me based on your previous experience with her and how she handled her home on her own.\n\nOP, there is more than one way to help people. And sometimes that's not the way they would prefer for you to help them. Often times, they want help that directly inconveniences or causes sacrifice to the person they're asking rather than to do what is necessary on their end to change their circumstances. I don't recommend any course of action that will cause you to ultimately have to change your whole lifestyle in order to cater to her.\n\nTo assist her, I would recommend that she contact local non-profits/charities because some do help to fund daycare in total or partially (if in the U.S., a non-profit called Family Guidance Center or even Catholic Charities may be able to help). In the meantime, if the father of the children (or willing family members of his) has a place to stay, she will need to place the children with him over foster care. Again, the daycare assistance would be available to either of them. Whatever work shift the father has, she can apply for work on an opposite shift from him so that they both become responsible for the care of their children. Depending on the area she lives in, she may qualify for Section 8 housing assistance (though there may be a longer wait for this) and food stamps to feed her children. There are even non-profits that assist with utility bills. Your sister is going to need to call around to every single agency that she can in order to change her situation.

OP, It's a no- win situation, so do what's required to save yourself.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your home, not hers, and you know she'll (along with the kids) trash it.  She needs a job and child care, and child support from the ex.  Even have the kids stay with the ex if it's a safe situation and he's got partial custody, they're his too after all.  In any case, it's not your responsibility to support her or pay for her poor life choices.  Cut off the financial support and keep firm on no housing.", "Ok im mixed here, but i think its because family first in my mind.   My bro has lived with me a few times and is a complete mooch.   I feel if you let her stay she need major rules and a contract.  She needs a job and a schedule for childcare to get one her feet as well as applying for hud or section 8.

Our family is not large enough or close geographically for family to so.", "...you rewrote her resume....I mean...good first step I guess?   \n\n\nI'm meaning you taking an afternoon at the very least, looking up all the different assistance programs she could utilize, correlating a list of names and numbers she can call, walk her through calling them or calling them yourself with her there to fill in the blanks, making her appointments, setting up a calender for her, etc. That sort of help. When you have depression it can be hard to even get out of bed. When you have anxiety issues, it is hard as hell to pick up the phone and talk to strangers.   \nYou just redoing her resume is like me asking you to help me clean out and organize the garage for a garage sale, but instead you go and do yardwork and paint the fence. I mean, it'll make it prettier for the sale, but it didn't actually help the core issue at all", "The goal really was to ensure she had at least a good start to finding a job.

They've been thrown to the wolves and the state of their apartment was because their Mother neither parented nor fixed their behavior. \n\nWho was feeding them? Are they getting regular nutrition?\n\nI'm not saying that the kids should be taken from her. I'm saying that if SIL can neither financially or mentally handle having kids, then she needs to access additional resources.

You can be poor, but you can keep a house clean). If you think she cant take care of the kids you have to let the autorities know. They can help her and the kids and they can see if the father is capable of taking care of the kids if needed. \n\nYou dont have to put your life on hold, unless when its really really necessaire.

Write down all the basic needs and decide how much you both can help by calling organizations with her. She can\u2019t leave the hotel until she has a job and enough savings for down deposits and utilities. So the hotel might be the most attainable for a bit. Make it a 6 month goal to get an apartment. She\u2019s truly struggling, so having some timed goals and things to check off might really help her. One thing at a time. \nI think its very important that she gets into therapy asap. There are free services at many hospitals. The wait time is awful, but so worth it. I also recommend she read the book (or listen to the audiobook) Keeping House While Drowning.
