Should he be like, I don't date ppl who have had a past\u2026? \n\nHaving a troubled past isn\u2019t the same thing as being vulnerable. You can *have been* vulnerable, but since have worked through your trauma and be in a much more stable place. Generally, I would say that people should avoid starting a relationship with someone who hasn\u2019t yet worked through serious trauma. It\u2019s not a recipe for a healthy relationship. \n\n>Should he be like, I don\u2019t date people\u2026 who expect things from me\n\nPeople should expect certain things from partners, but it should be a fairly equal exchange. If one partner is giving substantially more than the other, that imbalance creates problems. In this case, because he likely made her feel \u201csaved\u201d by him, it created a sense of debt between them - one that could never be repaid. That makes it very difficult for her to leave if she wants to. \n\n>Should all SAHM get divorced?\n\nWhile having a stay-at-home parent (especially a SAHM, as you pointed out), can certainly lead to a power imbalance, it doesn\u2019t need to. This power imbalance typically comes from the attitude that childcare and housekeeping is easy, leading to it being undervalued. \n\nThe solution is simply to value the work of stay-at-home parents, and not to believe that the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d is contributing more. \n\nAs far as practical considerations, spousal support and child support allow for stay-at-home parents to be just as free to leave the relationship as the \u201cworking\u201d parent. \n\nBasically, as long as nothing else messed up is going on, and both people are proactive about having healthy attitudes towards childcare and housekeeping, a couple can have a stay-at-home parent be part of their arrangement without there being a power imbalance.", ">It\u2019s not the least bit pedantic.
