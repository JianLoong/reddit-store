Seen it way to much that the ex will sell of the gifts or accidentally \"break\" them and they disappear.", "NAH\n\nIt probably would have been best to talk with your ex. Also, if it were things your ex couldn't afford, perhaps it would have been a good idea to give her some of the expensive presents that were \"from Santa\" to reduce enmity between your ex and your fiancee?\n\nI mean, your post didn't indicate anything other than your ex having less money to spend and you/your fiancee having enough money to spend like that.", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 was just trying to celebrate Christmas like she always wish to but you need to talk with her about not crossing boundaries by spoiling too much gifts!

That was more for her than it was for anyone else. Your ex doesn\u2019t understand that, and her jealousy is preventing her from doing so. Your fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t \u201cupstage\u201d anyone.", "You should have communicated this to your ex first so she wasn't blindsided.  So sorta the asshole.

It sounds like your fiancee only did those things from a place of love and joy. Don't let your ex try to tarnish it.", "NAH, but only narrowly because you didn't think it through. The gifts seem excessive, especially with the fact that the kids do get gifts from their mum, too. Really, I've seen too many spoiled children and you don't want your kids end up like them. \nNext time you make sure that you coordinate better and tone it down a little. In the end, the things that  really matter and that will stay long after the tablet is broken and the console becomes vintage are the memories and the experiences.", "NTA. Your fiancee sounds like a very kind person. If I were the ex, this is exactly the type of person I would want as a step parent for my children - someone who cares about them and wants to make them happy. I had a step parent who was the complete opposite, and it sucked. Seems like your ex is just jealous.", "NTA.

If your fianc\u00e9e just went and bought them all this stuff on a normal\nTuesday, then yeah, that would be a little much.

Now yeah if one home is poorer than the other it does suck for said parent to feel they can't provide or spoil their kids the way they wish they could but honestly just be happy anyone loves your kid enough to do so", "NTA, nor is your fiancee. I would hope your ex would be happy that her kids are getting a good Christmas with someone who is also really excited about it.\n\nGonna address the elephant in the room here, too. Your fiancee is *really* young for you. She's only 24, she didn't have much of a childhood herself, and now all of a sudden she is going to be a stepmother to two school-aged kids? You can make all sorts of excuses about how \"age is just a number\", \"we're just two people who love each other\", etc. but I don't think this is going to end well.", "Your fianc\u00e9 saved your ex a lot of money.

But getting the kids everything on their lists without checking with their other parent is a little rude. \n\nHaving said that - it sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9e just got caught up in the excitement. There\u2019s no need to make a massive deal out of it, but as a family you need to work on communication, especially as you\u2019re introducing someone new to your kids\u2019 lives. \n\nNext Christmas maybe presents should be something which are discussed before hand, but no need to scale back on everything else (which, let\u2019s be fair, the kids will remember way more fondly and for far longer than their presents anyway).", "so how long have you two been dating?", "NAH.  But, I think when co-parenting it\u2019s important to communicate re gifts, etc., in advance.  If one parent is going to go \u201cabove and beyond,\u201d that\u2019s fine, but give the other parent a heads up, make sure they don\u2019t have concerns about big gifts like a tablet (kid\u2019s age could be a factor, for example).  Communicating in advance can avoid the other person seeing things through a less favorable lens.", "NTA really BUT: It might have been good to communicate with her what presents they are getting this Xmas,  too many expensive things repeatedly might be result in major spoiling / influence their character on the long run.

If your fiancee bought everything they asked for, what was left for their mom to gift them?", "1) why is this the first time your children had an amazing Christmas. Would you not allow their mother to give that when you were a family. \n\n2) how long have you been with your child bride? 13 year age difference and she was a kid only 6 years ago. A kid with a lot of trauma which makes me concerned that there may have been some grooming going on. \n\n3) And again - asking the first question again cause we all know your fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t pay for Christmas - why did you not let mom do this when y\u2019all were together?\n\nI\u2019m going with YTA for being a pervy old man and being engaged to a kid with trauma and being on board with doing everything you can to make your children\u2019s mom look bad.", "NTA.", "ESH - I get that your fianc\u00e9e was excited but if it was gifts from a Santa letter, then there should have been a discussion had with your ex, their mom.

Your fianc\u00e9e made the holiday about her and giving the kids exorbitant gifts is not a good precedent to set.\n\nOn an unrelated note your fianc\u00e9e is very young (no judgement here), inexperienced, and has a lot of life trauma. I doubt she is well positioned to \u201cbe a mom\u201d. If she\u2019s not in therapy for that trauma, it\u2019s worth exploring so she can get a handle on her past before it affects you and the kids.", "YTA\nthere are plenty of ways for your fianc\u00e9e to revel in the Christmas spirit without upstaging the mother of your children.\n\nAt the at the very least, you should\u2019ve discussed the gifts with your ex.\n\nEdit:  I am aware that none of the gifts were on the mom\u2018s list. Still, it\u2019s a massive overreach of boundaries to buy these excessive things.  It totally upstages anything the mom bought for them.", "Not going to vote, but I\u2019m going to give you advice.  When you are coparenting, you always communicate and coordinate with your coparent about gifts for the kids.", "INFO: did you coordinate with your ex about buying the kids\u2019 gifts? Or did you buy everything they wanted, give it first, and then leave her to return half of what she bought and only give them the boring needful things like socks? Because if so, that was an AH move, for sure. \n\nThe rest of the exuberance was fine, but you cannot forget that you are CO-parenting and all need to coordinate on some things.", "YTA because you don\u2019t upstage the mom and you are way to old for your fianc\u00e9. She clearly had trauma from her family and you are taking advantage of her daddy issue. You are 13 years older than her.", "INFO: How long have you been dating? Did she use her money or your money for all this?", "INFO - if she bought *everything* on your kids list, it's very likely she bought things their mother already bought them... did you guys communicate at all so that wouldn't happen? Is it possible that's what the actual issue is?", "INFO\n\nSo why aren't you talking to your kids mom about whether she thought the gifts were appropirate as well?", "ESH. You should coordinate gifts with your ex so that you each get more or less even gifts. Your fianc\u00e9e is of course free to go all out with decorations, baking cookies, etc. Your ex didn't have to blow up at you though - she also could have tried to coordinate all of this.", "NAH. Maybe this should be seen as a learning experience for your new relationship and next year maybe your girlfriend and you can co ordinate what is ok to do with the kids their mum.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 wasn't trying to upstage anyone, she just wanted a Christmas she always dreamed about.\n\nYour ex needs to realize not everyone grew up in a happy family. Also that some people *really* enjoy gift giving and making people happy.", "The 9yo may or may not still be a believer in Santa. Also, a lot of families are being counseled against Santa being the giver of big gifts, as it leads to children in poorer families seeing what \u201cSanta\u201d gives others and wondering why they aren\u2019t good enough for Santa to give them the big things too. OP and his ex should have talked about expectations and gift giving ahead of time to avoid issues like this. By going all-out this year, OP\u2019s girlfriend may have set some very high expectations that they may not be able to meet in the future.", "That gecko lied to me all my life.", "They were discussed in order to prevent gifting duplicate items", "This is the advice I'd hoped to see. Communication stops multiple gifts, inappropriate gifts, \"outdoing\" and so on.", "I asked what she was planning to buy(some toys and a few books) I made sure not to get anything she was buying", "Child bride? She is a 24 year old woman. Women have their own minds too.  If it was a man that was 24 you wouldn't call him a boy.", "I thought the same thing with the mention of trauma and her never really having an adult role model, and now she's suddenly engaged and a step mom. Bit of an unhealthy power dynamic, but I don't think he's automatically a perv because she might be getting therapy or something, and they have a healthy relationship.\n\nAnyways, I think they're the AH for not checking with bio mom to see what she was going to be getting them since the kids wrote a list for (presumably) both parties and step mom got EVERYTHING on it without considering bio mom. It's weird that neither party knew anything about the other during a holiday that should revolve around kids. Bio mom is also TA for not communicating because she could have done the same thing, and OP would have never known until the day of.\n\nI'd say ESH or NAH because neither party communicated, but that might be what works for them, so now you can't really get mad at a situation you both created.", "Exactly, there are some huge red flags in this story. The age gap and playing out a childhood trauma with his kids are two.", "She wasnt planning to buy those she was just mad because my fiancees gifts were much more expensive than hers", "OP commented that he did speak to her about the presents and he made sure not to buy anything she was already buying.", "He asked ahead of time. He stated in another comment.", "Im the one taking advantage? She was the one who spent all my money lol\n\nAnd thanks for the math lesson", "What is inappropriate about the gifts? Doesn't seem like anything that requires that type of conversation. Just a simple heads up that this is what they're getting the kids so there's no duplicates.", "What was there for the ex to coordinate? Are you implying that she was aware of fianc\u00e9e\u2019s plan?", "I down voted you for making the fianc\u00e9e\u2018s trauma the exes problem. Not sure if the fianc\u00e9e actually did anything wrong, because someone told me that the OP and ex discussed the gifts and that he made sure his fianc\u00e9e wasn\u2019t buying anything on the ex\u2019s list. \n\nBut if in fact the fianc\u00e9e did overstep boundaries in some way, then an apology would be in order.

How can OP have checked there wouldn\u2019t be any duplicates if he knew his partner was planning to get everything on the list? If he didn\u2019t know she was planning to do that, there *would* have been duplicates. And, more importantly, if it had been discussed, it wouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to his ex the next day.", "I\u2019m going with YTA.  how is he, fancy electronic toys are going to upstage books and most toys.", "So your kids had two separate Santa letters? If so then I would clarify that in your post, because that does change how it reads.", "Can your ex afford those expensive gifts?", "Info: were your own gifts also more expensive than your ex\u2019s? If yes, do you normally spend a lot more money on birthday and Christmas gifts than your ex does?\n\nWere these gifts unusually expensive? What I mean is, was it a shock that the kids got an Xbox and an iPad?", "Oh OK. That would\u2019ve been pretty important to include in the OP lol. Then I\u2019m not sure why the ex would be upset.", "Wow. Great way to think of someone you are going to marry. \u201cThey spent your money\u201d. She spent it on your kids and if you are getting married then property becomes co owned.", "No i dont think so", "The gifts were from both of us not just my fiancee\n\nWe don't spoil them so maybe? I mean its not something i cant afford but I guess it was unusual because I dont usually spend that much money in one occasion", "Based on the comment. I dont think his ex was able to afford big gifts and was jealous. He said she was planning on buying some toys and books.", "It was a joke relax", "I guess maybe that's why she felt that way, or maybe she doesn't want to get the kids used to that. Regardless I agree with the other comments. There should have been more of a discussion of your fianc\u00e9's plan with the mom.\nSo she wasn't as caught off guard.\n\nEdit: it's not nice to have the step parent buy way more expensive gifts you can afford, I can create some problems especially with young children. Her delivery wasn't the best though. I feel like there needs to be more communication with each other.", "Your OP says your fianc\u00e9e bought them all of these things. So this comment is kind of confusing. Either way, you share these kids with another person. They\u2019re not emotional support animals for your fianc\u00e9e to heal her trauma through.", "Thanks. I just saw the comment. I think I\u2019m gonna change my judgment to YTA. Obviously, the mom is going to feel bad that she can\u2019t afford these things and this other woman comes in and buys all these nice things.", "Is that on op though? Like yes it sucks but his ex should put her feelings aside and be happy for her kids. \n\nThe only thing I think op could have done is asked if she wanted to go in on it and it was a gift from them all instead.", "Yes, I think it is on the OP. Fianc\u00e9e is something of a replacement mother figure and she is trying to work through her trauma by spoiling someone else\u2019s kids. Like I said in my other comment, there are many other ways to get into the Christmas spirit without spending excessive money. And I wonder whose money it actually was. Probably not a 24 year old\u2019s."]}
