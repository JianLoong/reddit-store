Wtf.", "You knew that this would be upsetting to your ex wife and you still let it happen. It\u2019s not about the gifts. It\u2019s about taking advantage of your ex not having the finances to buy big gifts and letting your fianc\u00e9 upstage her- that\u2019s what happened.\nIt\u2019s just disrespectful .

That way everyone gets something the kiddos really want.", "This. If I had an award I would give it to you. When my son was little I would have extensive conversations with his stepmom so we could make sure that between them, myself, and their families and mine (all large groups of people) we could avoid duplicate or over the top gifts. It was kind of exhausting and I have (unknown back then) ADHD so I struggled but it worked.", "Agreed. There needs to be clear communication, especially when there is a brand new SO being brought into the picture.

Communicated with the adults of the respective households, and they gifted games to go with the consoles.", "Yupp. Each kid gets ONE cheap gift from Santa. So sick of going over this with my ex wife and her family every year.

A much more sustainable approach would be to \u201cgo all out\u201d in the form of decorating and fun activities, not tons of presents.

She\u2019s, obviously, got daddy issues and OP is taking advantage of that to marry a super young girl.", "1. Allow her? I don't allow a grown woman she is allowed to do whatever she wants. With her own money. We had separate finances\n\n2. She is not a child\n\nUgh you caught me. I'm totally using her. That's why I got her to attend therapy and am supporting her through med school.

Nothing pervy about it, I did all the chasing initially. No daddy issues here, I just fell in love with someone older than me. Just trying to say an age gap doesn't mean that someone was groomed, nor that it was the older person being \"pervy.\" Nor is 24 a kid anymore. Maybe give the fiance the benefit of the doubt that she knew her own mind.", "lol", "Someone asked OP why this was the first Christmas like this for the kids even though he could afford it, and whether the ex wasn\u2019t allowed to make such a Christmas when they were together. OP said ex was a grown woman and allowed to do whatever she wants, but added they kept their finances separate. It sounds like he is willing to allow the young fianc\u00e9 to \u201cspend his money\u201d (he made reference to her \u201cspending his money\u201d as a reason why it couldn\u2019t possibly be *him* taking advantage) on the kids, but didn\u2019t act similarly in his past relationship.

Thanks for the random laugh today...", "I 100% agree.  The age difference really caught be by surprise as well.

Why do people always jump to this with older men and younger women (not that OP is even old) but it's ok reversed?", "They know it was a one time thing. They even helped me make this christmas better for her. They did extra chores to get more money and buy her a gift. You should have seen her face, she didn't expect it", "LMAO,\n\nSo you asked, she told you, and she... Never asked you the question back? She really should have asked what you were gonna do for the kids you share, you even gave her the perfect opening. It's not ideal for your fiancee to be basically spoiling these kids with items so expensive that their other household can't even afford to keep up, and I think you should step up to address that issue. But also damn, how could mom be so interested? Sigh. Poor kids.", "Do you pay child support?", "I don't really care how other people spend their money on gifts for Christmas. However,  I do agree with the sentiment that kids who get way too many expensive gifts do usually end up as spoiled and ungrateful.\n\nI don't like the attitude of leaving people out of the discussion loop or having one bio parent feel like they're not doing enough or that they look bad.
