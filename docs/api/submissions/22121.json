It was all cool and dandy when all of our kids were children, but now that they are all teens and older, with the youngest being 15, it kind of got awkward. During our recent trip, my son(15M) as well as one of my nephews(16M) came to me and my eldest brother and asked us if it was possible to not have Selene come on the next trip with us because they would like to have a father-son trip with just us, since they can't really speak freely or behave how they want because it feels weird having her there. I understood where they were coming from, since most of them are in that awkward phase and having a girl present when you just want to rowdy with your cousins can feel very weird, so I discussed it with my eldest brother and we decided to ask James if it was possible for him to not bring Selene on the next trip, and bring another one of his kids instead so we could have a father-son vacation.   \n\n\nJames did not take this well at all, and said he will simply not be coming even though we explained our reasoning very well to him and I had my son and nephew tell him how they felt so he could see their perspective.

How exactly are you raising these boys if they don\u2019t feel comfortable \u201cbeing themselves\u201d around a girl? Being able to interact politely with women is a normal part of everyday life that they need to adapt to. You are raising your sons to think it\u2019s ok to act one way around just other men, and a different way around women. That it\u2019s ok for them to treat women as second class citizens. This is why women were historically kept out of many careers, hobbies, sports, clubs\u2026 so that men could get have their \u201cboy\u2019s club\u201d at women\u2019s expense. I\u2019m guessing that this is not the only sexist message that you are inadvertently teaching your son. You should instead be teaching him that women are people just like men are.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair and sexist to exclude your niece for this reason.", "YTA.", "YTA for supporting this \u201cspeak freely\u201d, \u201cbehave how they want\u201d and be \u201crowdy\u201d business to exclude one cousin.

If a man feels like he can\u2019t speak freely in front of a woman (or in this case, teenage boys feeling that way in front of a teenage girl), what that tells me is that they want to say something misogynistic, most likely something overly sexualizing women. It\u2019s your responsibility to teach your sons that it\u2019s not okay to treat women like that, not cater to them by trying to exclude your niece.", "YTA. You have the exact degenerative mindset of \u201cboys will be boys\u201d. What do you mean \u201ccant speak freely\u201d, what cant be said around specifically a girl?

You and your brother can give yours sons the experience they want without excluding your niece who has been going on these trips with her father for a decade.", "YTA, obviously. You're teaching your sons it's ok to exclude your niece while at the same teaching your niece where she stands in this family - kudos on the multitasking. You said the trip is for everyone who's interested - I'm sure Selene used to have fond memories of going fishing with her cousins, dad, and uncles until you made her feel unwanted.  \"I just wanted to listen to my son and nephew and give them the experience they wanted and not dismiss their feelings and make them feel heard.\" I guess that sentiment doesn't  include women.", "YTA- niece was there first, not fair to exclude her now.", "YTA\n\nIf there's something you or your brother want to say or do that you feel is inappropriate to say or do in front of a girl, then it's equally inappropriate to say or do it in front of your male children.

What if this was your daughter?
