I understood where they were coming from, since most of them are in that awkward phase and having a girl present when you just want to rowdy with your cousins can feel very weird, so I discussed it with my eldest brother and we decided to ask James if it was possible for him to not bring Selene on the next trip, and bring another one of his kids instead so we could have a father-son vacation.   \n\n\nJames did not take this well at all, and said he will simply not be coming even though we explained our reasoning very well to him and I had my son and nephew tell him how they felt so he could see their perspective.

We have a boy and a girl. And sometimes we do boys days and girls days and we go all do our own thing. And sometimes we flip that and do father/daughter and mother/son days.

I have a cherished group of friends and sometimes they'll join and we'll break off in different dynamics and configurations.\n\nMy point being they should have taken that opportunity to add to the situation (more trips!
