Obviously there is no reason to negatively judge teen moms, but that doesn't mean it's a good thing to become one.  And honestly it sounds like what your mom is doing could even approach emotional abuse.  She sounds like a popular girl bullying you for being a \"nerd.\"  For her to question your sexuality????

You finally express your feelings and she cries? I\u2019m curious what other ways she has needed your emotional dependency and attachments. \n\nStart planning your launch, when possible.

Being a teen mom is nothing to be proud of. I also became a mom at 15. I love my kids more than anything and I'm proud of what I've accomplished, but there's a reason people should at least wait until they're, you know, adults. It's a major struggle especially for someone that is still growing. \n\nInstead of trying to force partying and boyfriends on you, she should be accepting you for who you are.

You were a bit harsh but it sounds like she wasn\u2019t letting up. In the future maybe just be very firm that you want to go to college, have a career, whatever it is that you\u2019d like to do and be clear those are your goals.

You choose not to go out, to rarely leave the home ever, and to have few friends. \n\nYou're an AH because you seem to think that socializing results in pregnancy. (I really hope you know socializing is not unprotected sex). Your mom can encourage you to go out and have friends (which you don't do often and don't have many of) without at all encouraging you to get pregnant (have unprotected sex). Pretending like there is no difference between socializing and teen pregnancy is weird and an AH move. You can leave the home without getting pregnant and she's not encouraging you to get pregnant by encouraging you to go outside. \n\nSimilarly at age 17 having conversations with you about your future (like what you want to do and where you are going to be.. is literally her job as a parent). She supposed to be talking to you about your plans and what you plan to do in the future and when and how. Like yeesh...", "Of course YTA.

I should know, I am one. \n\nOur son is 18 and we had the same fears as your mother. He could spend days up in his room. His mother would ask him if he was going out to see his friends and he would say that he wasn't. That he could talk to them online. He used to be very athletic but now didn't exercise at all and was putting on weight. We were afraid for what kind of life he was going to have. He never expressed any romantic interest at all to the point where we assured him we would love and support him no matter what his sexuality.\n\nThen this fall he went to college and now he has friends he goes out with all the time. They play ping pong and basketball and he is back in shape. No sign of any romance but I am so very relieved. His grades are improved and he is engaged with looking for a career other than professional gaming now for the first time. Now I think that life is just different than when his mother and I grew up. Likely it's the same with your mom. Maybe you could reassure her that your behavior is normal for your generation.
