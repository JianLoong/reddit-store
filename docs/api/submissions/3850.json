You can apologize for saying it but it\u2019s still a reality. If she brings it up again ask her \u201cwhy is it so important to you that I throw my education away and get knocked up young?\u201d  Don\u2019t say it mean.  Just ask out of curiosity.", "She did need to hear it.  She's pressuring you to be like she was, but its clear that behavior of hers had some serious consequences. Obviously there is no reason to negatively judge teen moms, but that doesn't mean it's a good thing to become one.  And honestly it sounds like what your mom is doing could even approach emotional abuse.  She sounds like a popular girl bullying you for being a \"nerd.\"  For her to question your sexuality????  Lord Almighty!\n\nNTA.  You can apologize to keep the peace, but communicate to your mom that you feel hurt when she compares you to herself, and that you feel hurt when she questions your intelligent life choices.", "NTA. Your responsible and sounds like she\u2019s peer pressuring in to doing irresponsible behaviors. Unfortunately seems like she\u2019s a 30 year old stuck in her high school mindset. You were with in all rights to say what you did because it\u2019s true!", "NTA. My mom also had me at 15, and tried to relive her ten years through my sister and myself. It's not ok and she obviously needed to be put in her place, it's not our fault they \"missed out\" because they were irresponsible.", "NTA. She beat her failures into your brain all the years. You finally express your feelings and she cries? I\u2019m curious what other ways she has needed your emotional dependency and attachments. \n\nStart planning your launch, when possible. Then, you and mom can have a relationship  that has equanimity (or at least you will).", "NTA. She got a taste of her own medicine.", "A soft NTA, because it was a mean thing to say. OTOH, your mother is very clearly trying to relive her teen years vicariously through you and that's just craptastic.\n\nNext time, just say, \"you do you, mom, and I'll do me.\"", "NTA Your mom is the last person that should pressuring you into that lifestyle. Being a teen mom is nothing to be proud of. I also became a mom at 15. I love my kids more than anything and I'm proud of what I've accomplished, but there's a reason people should at least wait until they're, you know, adults. It's a major struggle especially for someone that is still growing. \n\nInstead of trying to force partying and boyfriends on you, she should be accepting you for who you are. And she should be thankful you don't want to repeat her struggles.", "NTA and be careful - sometimes families don\u2019t like to see you be more successful than they were, and they will redefine their choices as \u201cachievements\u201d and your choices as \u201cfailures\u201d. You were a bit harsh but it sounds like she wasn\u2019t letting up. In the future maybe just be very firm that you want to go to college, have a career, whatever it is that you\u2019d like to do and be clear those are your goals. Ask her to support those goals and if she can\u2019t then let her know how you feel about that. Try not to make it about her.", "NTA.", "NTA what you said may have been harsh, but your mom never seemed to emotionally mature beyond her teen years.

You were right.", "You are nta", "ESH. Your mom shouldn't compare the two of you unless she's using herself as an example of behaviors/actions to avoid. You shouldn't have said that shit. Bar none.", " ESH. Your mom should get off your case. You should watch your mouth & go back to studying. As for being happy you\u2019re not a teen mom - you\u2019re only 17.

You choose not to go out, to rarely leave the home ever, and to have few friends. \n\nYou're an AH because you seem to think that socializing results in pregnancy. (I really hope you know socializing is not unprotected sex). Your mom can encourage you to go out and have friends (which you don't do often and don't have many of) without at all encouraging you to get pregnant (have unprotected sex). Pretending like there is no difference between socializing and teen pregnancy is weird and an AH move. You can leave the home without getting pregnant and she's not encouraging you to get pregnant by encouraging you to go outside. \n\nSimilarly at age 17 having conversations with you about your future (like what you want to do and where you are going to be.. is literally her job as a parent). She supposed to be talking to you about your plans and what you plan to do in the future and when and how. Like yeesh...", "Of course YTA. It's her job to worry about you and look out for you and want you to have friends and a social life. Shaming her for what she did as a teen is uncalled for.
