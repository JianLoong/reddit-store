The wedding was out of state so my husband and I were going to make it into a three-day weekend. We had a sitter lined up months ago. The day before we were set to leave she had to cancel for a family emergency. We tried to find a last-minute sitter that we trusted and could also do just overnight but came up empty. I tried calling and texting my brother about the situation but couldn't get hold of him. We were both in the wedding party and I didn't want to leave my brother and his soon-to-be-wife in a bind. So I called my mother after that since I knew she was with them. I explained the situation and she said she'd call me back after talking to him. \n\nFour hours pass and we didn't hear back. We had to make a decision, and since we are currently sharing one vehicle couldn't really leave my husband and kid without a vehicle, and had put a lot of money already into the wedding and trip, we just took our baby with us. We got there later than we originally planned and just went to our room. The next afternoon was the wedding, and my husband and I planned to swap time out- I'd go the ceremony and part of the reception while he stayed with the baby, and he could attend the second half the reception while I stayed with the baby. When the ceremony was over and we were heading inside to the reception, my husband had the baby inside in her stroller. I joined my husband and went to say hello to some family members, and went with him to congratulate my brother and new SIL. Husband said his hellos and congrats, then went back to our room with our child. \n\nI left the reception area a few times to bring my husband some small plates of food so he didn't have to wait for his turn to eat. On one of my trips back my brother spoke with me about it being a child-free wedding and his wife was upset that my husband had the baby in the lobby and that I kept leaving the reception. I told him they can't be too upset because we didn't bring the baby into the wedding area or the reception. The rest of the time I was at the reception I kept getting comments from who I'm guessing were SIL's family and her bridesmaids about how I was trying to steal her thunder by having my baby there. SIL kept asking why I didn't just leave them at home and would not accept my reason for not doing so.\n\nIt's been a sore spot for my family and her all weekend. Am I an A-hole for bringing the baby with us?", "created_utc": 1676313271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111gbbh/aita_for_bringing_my_baby_to_the_hotel_resort_my/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she also try to ban all babies from the hotel?\n\nYou are NTA here - you managed a very difficult situation while still respecting the requirements of your brother's wedding.  Did his new wife plan on you being by her side every single second? That's not realistic or practical.

They sound very inflexible and I fear there is nothing you could have done anything different that would have been 'right' in their eyes. Don't let them talk you down. It's their problem not yours.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard finding childcare in the first place especially last minute.

I\u2019m childfree and completely agree with childfree weddings. In this case, you made the best possible decision based on the circumstances and you didn\u2019t bring the baby to the ceremony or reception.

They weren\u2019t available for an opinion and I\u2019m willing to bet had y\u2019all skipped the wedding all together because childcare fell through they would be just as if not more mad. I kinda hope they get put in this position when they have children.", "NTA. You got hit by a cancellation last minute that you couldn't really prepare for and it was better to bring your baby than literally abandoning it. Your brother and SIL should understand that those things happen ALL THE TIME and its always good to make accommodations whenever something that like that happens, especially for a child-free wedding.\n\nIf your brother and SIL were understanding, they would've had accommodations knowing that sometimes people cannot afford to keep their child at home, or last minute occurrences occur that make you bring the child to the wedding. Shit happens, not your fault though.", "NTA. \n\nI have no children, I would want a child free wedding, I might throw up a flag of worry seeing a baby in the lobby (of a wedding guest). But I'd keep an eye on it, and seeing as no children entered the wedding area, would move on. You did the best you could given the situation, and honored the wishes of the couple, besides a baby sighting in the PUBLIC LOBBY. \n\nThe only reason to be bothered by people leaving the reception a few times is because the couple is choosing to focus on that kind of small thing instead of having fun. I can't imagine spending money on food, decorations, and space, and then giving a shit who was in the room at any given moment. I'd be eating, chatting, and dancing, not patrolling the room to see who has escaped. \n\nThis is a situation where I think you should fully ignore the comments and snide remarks you are hearing. If your brother and SIL address it with you again, then just say \"listen, we had a plan, the sitter cancelled, we had no one else we trusted. I couldn't leave my husband without a car, it was all very last minute, we wanted to be here for you and not create drama, and also respect your child free wishes. The baby has to go through the lobby, and other than that, you had no sighting of said child, so I think we did a pretty good job. I would have assumed you had bigger things to focus on that day then me stepping out a few times and seeing a baby, once, in the lobby.  I'm not going to apologize for trying to make this work in the best way possible, and my child exists and I'm going to make sure she is properly cared for. Your next child free event, I will note that if I can't find a sitter, you'd prefer I not come at all, so don't worry, this kind of thing won't happen again.", "Haha those critics sure told on themselves. How did all those people see your baby out in the lobby, away from the reception, unless they were dipping out on the reception themselves? Sounds like the party was insufficiently engaging, and stirring up unnecessary controversy is how the bored drama llamas are entertaining themselves.\n\nNTA. You did everything right and the bride and groom got the reception that happens when they refuse to answer their phones. Shit happens. You dealt with it admirably in light of their lack of input, making an impossible situation somehow work. You have nothing to be ashamed of. A baby cannot be left unattended, period. Whereas the bride and groom could have gotten married without you. So you would have been reasonable to stay home. Instead, you skillfully threaded the needle so that it was possible to do both. Kudos.", "NTA, you had 2 choices, do what you did or not go; either way you would have had comments\n\nAmazing the amount of people who want child free weddings not realising guests will prioritise their kid over the wedding", "NTA\n\nYou had care that ended up not working out. You tried your best to get ahold of the bride and groom. You made a plan to make sure that the child wasn\u2019t at the ceremony and reception (one that sounded super inconvenient to you and your husband).  You honestly did the best you could do in the situation. It wasn\u2019t like you waited till the last minute to try and find care and it wasn\u2019t like you disregarded her wishes. Solidly NTA.", "Given everything you said... NTA. You did what you could to accommodate their request. I am not sure how you leaving the reception is taking away anything from the couple", "NTA\n\nThey're going too far on this child-free status.

Hopefully you can bring the baby to your brother\u2019s next wedding!", "NTA, I get the drive behind the \"child free wedding\" but don't understand the practicality of it. Especially when these people get mad when those with children are unable or unwilling to attend.", "NTA. But SIL is.", "NAH because you tried to get ahold of them but they wouldn't answer and you were forced into making a decision. And outside of just not going at all I think you chose the best course of action.", "NTA\n\nGo lc with the SiL and her family. Bday and holiday cards only.

Lots of nuance to it.", "Yes but op leaving several times is obviously disrupting to the other guests which is why they started saying something.", "No but it's reasonable to not have someone keep getting up several times and being distracting to other people which is why the other guests said something too.", "Are you serious? Have you ever been to a wedding? Do you not go to the bathroom? Like ... how is it disruptive to quietly leave for a few minutes?
