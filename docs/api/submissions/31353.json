We\u2019ve since had a good relationship where we meet and usually go for a walk or eat in a resturant. \n\nAfter the test I said that i had promised to give his cousin an update.

However, I hope to be in touch and able to share more soon. Until then, I\u2019d appreciate your discretion.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile tell your biological father that you are going to send the above to your cousin precisely because the cousin keeps asking. Not saying anything / just not responding is going to lead to a conflict because cousin may instead try to find out the answers he isn\u2019t getting from you elsewhere in ways that are troublesome to your father and cousin may see you as withholding things when he tried to help you. In other words, just ignoring as your father wants can still result in this blowing up and explaining that to your father may help him see the difficult position he is putting you in. On the other hand, messaging your cousin behind your father\u2019s back and telling him exactly what your father asked you not to tell is going to impair trust between you and your father when he inevitably finds out you did say something.\n\nThe best way forward is to be honest and open with both of them, without sharing the part your father doesn\u2019t want shared, his name, and while still respecting everyone\u2019s wishes and privacy within reason.

Give him time to figure out how to handle this.", "Ask your father why it should be kept from him and why your sister gets a speaking part to make that decision", "NTA\n\nYour sperm donor doesn't get to control this information. It's just as much your information. And it's not sperm donor's daughter's information at all. Do with it what you please.", "Well this is tricky imo. You may be related but it is his family and he might know best as to how things should go down. However, do make it clear to him how uncomfortable you are with the situation and ask him to be more forthcoming with the why he feels things need to be going this way!", "NAH. Just tell the cousin you don't really have anything to report but when you do, you'll keep them in the loop.", "NTA -But your bio-dad definitely is! \nWhy did he wait until only 2 weeks ago to tell his daughter when you found out in July? If he wanted to have an opinion on who got told and when he should have done it 20 years ago when you were born. Since he didn't it is no longer his decision. If he was so worried about his daughter knowing about something that happened 20 years ago, he had the chance to to tell her at any time before now. If he had no idea you were conceived then it shouldn't be an issue unless he cheated and doesn't want that information out. If so, that's on him and he is afraid of the consequences and will never tell anyone. You probably haven't been contacted by the daughter because she doesn't know, if he was so worried about it he would have told her before he went to meet you. Do what feels right to You. You are the only one that really has any say in this. \nI found out at about 35 that I had a half sister....who was 50, She  found out she was adopted and started searching, she somehow connected to someone that connected her to me. She contacted me about the possibility of being related....you can be dann sure I contacted her back INSTANTLY!", "Bonus points for using \"tricksy.\"", "This is the way.", "Her father already blew up his marriage when he had his affair with OP's mother. OP has confirmed that. They gave Dad time to tell the daughter. He's had plenty of time to bring this out. He's a coward and a liar. OP should be free to reach out to other members of the family.", "Oh fuck off", "Or processing", "I'm sorry, so your suggestion to this girl who just met her father and is otherwise attempting to establish a relationship is, Ruin his life? Are you on drugs?\n\nWhich one of her family members exactly do you think is going to welcome her with open arms when she does this?", "Yeah, depending on how far away that \"other city\" is and what she does for a living, an irl meeting could genuinely be a pain in the ass to arrange due to distance, busy schedules, cost, etc.", "So, is he still with his wife? Is he trying to keep you a secret so he doesn\u2019t have to explain? Because I\u2019m concerned he didn\u2019t actually reach out to his daughter", "Major agree! \n\nAnd OP said it's been how long? 5 months or something? Her father isn't just taking away OP's ability to converse with the single cousin but the WHOLE FAMILY by doing it this way. It's already been taken from OP once, and he's trying to do it again. \n\nThat aside, I do think it's rather strange to put aside the potential that everyone else in the family might welcome her with open arms even if the half-sib doesn't. Like does this single person's discomfort mean that OP doesn't get to meet and have family in these other people?\nThere's definitely a delicate way of handling this but this moving of the goal post makes me feel like it's not at all about OP or the sister really, but her father not wanting his dirty secrets aired and still wanting to have the relationship.", "Yeah, it's a very odd situation. Even if he did tell her, which there's no confirmation he did even though it would be very easy to do nowadays, it's still not a matter that only pertains to her. That sort of idea that she has the right to *demand* OP tells no one else comes from a place of control only, in my opinion. You may not want something to be shared, but people are still gonna be able to share it if they want to. You can't control that. You can be upset, it may be fitting or not to the situation. You can also try to negotiate things so both parts are happy to some extent, rather than only one's wishes being taken into consideration.", "I mean, it was a conscious choice from the cousin using MyHeritage too. Like being linked to potential new relatives and ancestry services is like\u2026 literally the whole product.\n\nDoes do regions and stuff obviously for ancestry/heritage, but that specific product is very family tree and history centered versus like 23andme which offers ancestry services for extra $$, but DNA origin breakdown and health are options there too. (I don\u2019t think 23andme links to potential relatives in their ancestry packages but I could be wrong).\n\nI get having patience and waiting to tell the rest of the family until OP\u2019s half-sister can process\u2026 but like homie who is tracking his family tree *knows*", "Actually if anything OP\u2019s silence is probably *more* sus to the cousin."]}
