I have trouble navigating social situations (though I think I\u2019ve gotten better since coming to college) which makes me think I might be in the wrong here.\n\nSince coming to college, I got a group of friends and it\u2019s been fun except they insist that I\u2019m in love with our new friend Mark (20m). He joined our group about a month ago. Me and Mark have a lot of things in common so we bonded quickly. Because of that, our other friends said that \u201cwe are in love\u201d and \u201cmade for each other\u201d. It was a good laugh until they kept repeating it. They kept making claims that made it sound like I had feelings for him and it got super weird. For instance, one day we were hanging out in Mark\u2019s dorm and I left when an emergency came up. In my rush I left my charger. It got returned to me but the others claimed I left it on purpose so I \u201ccould leave a piece of me with him\u201d. Another time I was eating spaghetti and some of them said I was \u201cpracticing to eat Mark\u2019s ass\u201d\u2026.Comments like this occur about 6 or 7 times a day. I have no idea where it\u2019s coming from. I\u2019m not even gay.\n\nA week ago. I asked Mark if he was as uncomfortable with it as I am. He didn\u2019t know they said those things because they never said it to him. It\u2019s only been to me (idk why). I sent a message to our group chat: \u201cguys, the comments you make about me and Mark are really making me uncomfortable. Especially since I found out they\u2019ve only been directed at me. Please stop. I don\u2019t find them funny or amusing.\u201d They apologized and said they wouldn\u2019t do it again. \n\nFriday, 6 of us (excluding Mark) went to dinner together. While we were waiting to order, Jada (19f) asked if I wanted to date Mark. I told her no and to drop that stuff since it makes me uncomfortable. She asked why I was so uncomfortable if it\u2019s not true. I told her that\u2019s exactly why: it\u2019s not true but they keep talking like it is. She said it is true and she knows it\u2019s true. I could feel myself getting angry and didn\u2019t want to meltdown so I just left. Walked out and drove back to my dorm. I texted the group chat that I did not wish to be around Jada given what happened. Jada got mad and said I was \u201cletting a guy ruin our friendship\u201d and \u201ci didn\u2019t know how to take a joke.\u201d I\u2019ve ignored her messages and calls.

If any of your group of \"friends\" try and tell you that, please don't believe them.\n\nIt's weird that they've got fixated on this idea of you having a romantic or sexual attraction to Mark, and even weirder that they only tease you about it and not him. \n\nBut given their frequency of bringing this up and then Jada continuing after you made it very politely but explicitly clear that it makes you uncomfortable and to stop, they are being AHs.

You set a boundary (and it sounds as though you were reasonable when asking them to knock it off), and they chose to ignore that. You have every right to be angry and cut them off, if they consistently refuse to acknowledge your boundaries.

Honestly idk if I'm reading too much in to it but for me it is verging on homophobia because it has a feeling of \"it's funny because they're both guys and that means they'd never actually do that\". If you think that someone might actually get together you wouldn't use it to make jokes because then you'd more or less just be stating facts? \nIdk I might be way off base here but I'm still 100% sure that Jada sucks.", "NTA. Letting it happen from Jada after you set the boundary would have signaled that it was ok for them to start back up.

They are basically bullying you low key. The faster you learn to stick to your boundaries the better. Stand up for you my young friend.", "Nah, you're NTA.  It's perfectly normal for some joking and ribbing among friends. However, once you expressed that it was to the point where you were highly uncomfortable, and you requested that it stop, and It didn't,  I think you handled it well enough.  There's no reason to continually endure that kind of shit.", "NTA. A little teasing between friends is ok, but they took this way too far.", "NTA. It is no longer a joke when you have expressed that you do not find it funny and you do not appreciate it. It is now bullying. It is also quite strange that they insist on this. Is it possible one of your friends has a crush on Mark and is jealous of you having such good rapport with him?", "NTA. THey're being idiots and really immature. they should stop because you've said it upsets you.", "NTA, you should always avoid toxic people.", "NTA you asked them to stop bc it was making you uncomfortable and Jada decided to continue.

He\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d The normal response is to then drop the subject and not bring it up again after you\u2019ve told them you don\u2019t see Mark that way. It is NOT normal or socially acceptable to then keep hounding someone about it, especially with that comment about \u201ceating ass\u201d. That\u2019s just so many levels of inappropriate and rude. \n\nMy guess is that your friends could tell their comments were making you uncomfortable and they were getting off on it. Your reaction amused or entertained them. That\u2019s why they did it.
