You leave, and let him figure it out.", "Nta- he is most likely (and i mean almost guaranteed) carrying on with another relationship. Not only the not letting you stay with him but the jealousy and mistrust (especially when so absurd) come from a guilty mind. He cant be trusted so why would he trust you.", "NTA.  Break up with that guy.  You asked if you could stay with him and he made excuses which forced you to find another option.  The fact that he knows you were his first choice and is still going to flip out is a gigantic red flag.  Sounds like he\u2019s flaky as hell.", "Of course you're NTA! Where did he expect you to stay? A house with no power? A hotel?", "NTA.

Based on this snippet of how your relationship is with this man I'd say just leave. He sounds like an ass and lowkey seems like he's projecting. I think he probably has a side piece and is trying to turn it on you by insinuating you're either in a relationship with your daughters boyfriend or his dad, both of which would be gross to assume", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend said no to having you stay during the storm so he doesn\u2019t get to judge.

A neighbor I got to know saw my plight,  she said she had a spare room and I could stay there instead of driving 200 miles a day. \n\nI told my wife of the offer, since she asked, I told her the truth, the lady was about our age, divorced and fairly attractive. I could tell she wasn't crazy about the idea, but she gave her permission saying, \"I'd rather having you banging the neighbor than dead on the highway from driving when you're exhausted\". \n\nOf course neither the banging or getting killed on the highway happened.
