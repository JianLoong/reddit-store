Not only the not letting you stay with him but the jealousy and mistrust (especially when so absurd) come from a guilty mind. He cant be trusted so why would he trust you.", "NTA.  Break up with that guy.  You asked if you could stay with him and he made excuses which forced you to find another option.

Is he comfortable with you just stopping by any time you want? If you normally do those things, then he's probably open and above board, but did he give you a legitimate reason why he didn't want to help you when you really needed him?
