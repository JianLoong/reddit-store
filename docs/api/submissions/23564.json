It\u2019s good either of y\u2019all said something though. Idk maybe it\u2019s superstition but I think it\u2019s always better to wait a while before announcing because the first few weeks can be murky waters. This just happened to my sister in law actually. Went to her obgyn for a check up and it went great, heart beat was good etc. 6 hours later she was in the ER having miscarried. \n\nNTA though dude. Just be by your wife\u2019s side. If any family comes nagging you I\u2019d say just ignore them until you can stand to deal with them in a way that won\u2019t lead to unnecessary lashing out from either party.", "NTA\n\nIt was harsh but well deserved.", "Definitely NTA. That\u2019s a common concern for people not wanting announce early.

Mom is a giant YTA for not having listened to your wishes about keeping quiet. Your NTA for being upset that this happened.", "NTA.  \n\n\nSo, let me get this in a ballsack. Your mom, against your wishes, started posting publicly your private information, so, you commented that private information was no longer a reality.   \n\n\nIn less of a summary, she pooped all over your wishes, apparently had no idea what happened because she didn't call to follow up or check up on you or your wife, and in a moment of anger, you told her, very tactfully, I might add, that she shared that information prematurely. \n\nI wouldn't share any information with her ever - she's completely breached every ounce of trust I have in her, and I don't know her. She shared something that isn't hers to share. I'm so sorry for your loss, and I wouldn't blame you for going LC for a while while you recover.", "YTA,  NOT because of how you responded to your mother being super inappropriate (which she was) but because what you did was just as bad as what she did. You made personal information public without your wife's consent. Now you are getting condolences which you don't want because YOU put it out there. \n\nThe right move would have been to call your mother immediately when she posted the news of your pregnancy and tell her that not only has your wife miscarried, but she (your mother) has proven that she can't be trusted with any information from now on, so she will not get any information that you're not ready to make public.", ">my dad says that I have every right to be upset but that I could have been nicer.\n\nWhat is the nicer way of saying \"my wife had a miscarriage\"? NTA.", "NTA unless your wife is not okay with your response. Your mother chose to not respect your wishes, everyone knows it can go wrong early in the pregnancy. Your mother was the butthole for posting it online, she took the risk and she made herself look like an insensitive dumbdumb. I also know (from experience unfortunately) that a miscarriage just makes you feel so empty, you sometimes don't really care about how you handle things.\n\nI hope you and your wife are okay, or otherwise will be okay soon.", "[deleted]", "First, I am so sorry for your loss.  Your feelings about everything that just happened are so valid, and I understand why you did what you did.\n\nThat said, unless your wife gave you explicit permission to put her information on your mom's Facebook, YTA.  Perhaps a justified asshole, but one nonetheless.  Ignore your mom's wailing, she got what was coming to her, but check in on your wife and mute your phones so you can take the time the two of you need.", "NTA", "Man it\u2019s like shitty boomer parents week on here. NTA your mother was way wrong for doing that.", "NTA x infinity \n\nand FECK all these relatives that swear they'll keep the pregnancy secret then blow it up on social media. \nShe got barely any of what she truly deserves.\nShe'd be out of any pregnancy/delivery info forever if it was me.\n\nSo so sorry.... Cocoon in with your wife, shut the world out. Just breathe for a while.", "Info: how does your wife feel about you having posted that she had a miscarriage?\n\nI feel N T A for how you treated your mom, but maybe Y T A if your wife didn\u2019t want to be telling people about the miscarriage publicly. \n\nAnd sorry for your loss.", "NTA. And I'm sorry.", "Your dad is right.  You have a right to be upset buy you could have handled it differently.  For example, by calling her on the phone.  Your mom was wrong, you were also wrong.\n\nESH", "Yta. I feel terrible for your wife", "Nta. Your mom disregarded your wishes. She violated your privacy. When SHE decided SHE wanted everyone to know SHE told YOUR information. Your private information. She posted\u2026you corrected her misinformation. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what you share and when. Explain to her from now on your private life is private from her until you are ready for everyone else to find out\u2026at which point she will find out when everyone does. NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to decide when and how you grieve.", "NTA. Your mom posted it & was an idiot. But because she posted it, you had to also respond to her so people who came across it wouldn't start with the congratulations.", "NTA, mostly because you are getting something of a pass due to the immense psychological and emotional shock and trauma of a miscarriage\n\nyou handled things badly and i think you know that but not unforgivably so I just dont think you were operating in your normal frame of reference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni dont think any harm will be done to your relationships that cant be fixed with a little understanding and explanation further down the line when the immediacy of the loss has faded a little.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand obviously you have my sympathy for your loss, any miscarriage is a tragedy", "NTA. The information was already public, thanks to your insensitive mom. \n\nAt best, you have staved off the potential congratulations you would have gotten from all the people ignorant of your wife's miscarraige. \n\nAnyone seeing your mom's post would most likely feel compelled to say something to your wife about it. \n\nAfter learning of the tragedy, they may show a little more tact, and only respond if your wife says something.", "INFO: How does your wife feel about your comment on the post?", "I'm sorry for your loss.", "Why did you feel the need to put this comment up twice?", "They didn't want condolences, but if he hadn't posted, they'd be getting congratulations instead, which is obviously much worse.", "I think his dad meant, \"Clearly your pregnancy was all about your mother and your miscarriage is also about *her*, which is very upsetting to *her*.\"\n\nI'd be ready to block both of them for the foreseeable future.", "And how do you know she did or did not give the ok?", "I didn't want people calling my wife to congratulate us.", "No, the correction needed to be as public as the announcement.  OP's wife does not need the grief of someone asking about the pregnancy because they only saw half the news on the MIL's social media.", "Let's just say it was better that I posted than I had let her post what she wanted.", "My apologies. I hadn't realized it posted twice. Not intentional. I deleted one of them. Thanks for pointing that out.", "Which is exactly why this should be dealt with privately and not on social media.", "maybe she should have. HER healing is more important that your mother's feelings", "The point is the pregnancy announcement is already public. If it's not *publicly* rebutted, they'll receive congratulations messages from a bunch of his mom's friends. There is no way to privately deal with the situation except for his mom privately messaging every person who might have seen the initial announcement and telling them that they miscarried, which for obvious reasons is not a viable option."]}
