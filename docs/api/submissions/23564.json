As for how the situation was handled, YTA for not telling your mom about the miscarriage. I understand it was painful, as I too have been through this.

Personally, I think it would have been better to contact your mom, let her know about the miscarriage, and ask her to remove the post rather than making the blunt announcement on her post, which, then elicited sympathy posts. I wouldn\u2019t apologize for not having let her know sooner, and holding her in suspense. \n\nI\u2019ve been on both sides of the situation as a young mother, who had a miscarriage and also as a grandma with knowledge of my children\u2019s pregnancies, that I\u2019ve been asked not to share.

I\u2019ve been asked to do it myself and I can see how in her excitement she could slip up.

I understand everyone's point of view saying that he could have told her privately, but then the issue is anyone who saw it maybe doesn't understand why a post was deleted. They would probably think the son is just being dramatic and wants to make the announcement himself or something and still say congratulations and start pestering OP and wife with comments and questions all while they're grieving. *Maybe* if he also did comment that she shouldn't be posting their personal lives without consent, that should have been handled privately. But honestly I think mom needed to learn the hard way as she clearly didn't respect the boundary from OP in the first place. My vote is \"ESH\" if OP also did say the second comment, but NTA if all he said was that they have lost the baby. I think mom needed the reality check and was way too fixated on her own weird obsession with being a grandma than on respecting OP and wife through a stressful time.", "Nope, I'm a USer. But, MIL is a nut, and this whole thing is nuts. And she needs a ball to her face. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "And no visits to your home between the time of attempting conception, until the child is a year old.", "I think we have different definitions of healing and judging from the ambiguity of OP's comment, I have a feeling that it would have caused additional trauma and unless you're the oppressed subject of a dictator, you don't heal trauma by causing trauma.", "I had back to back miscarriages before my oldest. If my mom had shared my news and I had to explain that to people I would have been devastated and I would have stopped sharing with her. Period. It doesn't matter how exciting news is, if it's not your news to share, don't share it. Certainly not on social media. OP's mom deserved to be called out", "The alternative is saying \u201cmom she\u2019s not pregnant please take this down\u201d on the post and everyone would\u2019ve been very confused and still would be sending messages either way. Op handled the Situation to the best he could and he\u2019s said in the comments that his wife wanted to comment on the post herself but his message worked better so that sounds to me like she knows he posted it. If he hadn\u2019t acknowledged it at all everyone would\u2019ve texted them congratulations and they\u2019d have to tell them all individually that there\u2019s no pregnancy. There aren\u2019t very many options and to me it sounds like they took the best route.", "It was already public.  They were already going to get congratulations messages.  \n\nPeople aren't going to unsee the post.", "he already told her not to announce it in the first place.", "In broadcasting the information on social media, a number of people had likely seen the post. Exactly what the OP and wife didnt want. \n\nThere is a reason people dont tell anyone about pregnancy in the early stages.\n\nDoing it this way meant the negative consequences ('condolences, which we don't want') were done away with at a stroke. And blame directly at where it should be - at the mom.\n\nPicking up the phone and asking her to delete it would not have achieved that.", "Why does she deserve that Right? The damage was already done. \nShe violated their privacy and their trust, and to save his wife and himself an extreme amount of heartache. He made a comment on the post that everybody would be seeing to congratulate him to put a stop to it.", "Right!?  \"You're significant other/family member told you they think their favorite color is actually blue instead of red like they've been telling you for years??  How toxic.  Better sever all human and digital contact with them forever.\"", "They didn't \"stoop to the same level of disrespect\" as the mom.  The mom posted something private about them on social media that they asked her to keep private.  The husband said what she posted was no longer the case.  He didn't post anything private about the mom.  The two things are in NO WAY on the same level.  How on earth was what he did disrespectful?", "LOL \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nFor sure", "Do you know what the term YTA means? Because I used it for the mom.", "I dealt with that, my mom told a ton of people after I\u2019d asked her not to and I was still running into people at Walmart weeks later that shouldn\u2019t have known in the first place. A public correction was definitely in place or else she would be getting congratulations on her miscarriage left and right", "He publicly made his mom look bad when there were polite ways to inform her of the situation he could have chosen to utilize instead. Is that simple enough for you to grasp? \n\n\"Praise in public, criticize in private\" is a common phrase because it's commonly accepted that even if someone is wrong, you correct them in private instead of pointing out their wrongness in public (as that's considered by polite society to the what the A-hole does, not the polite person).\n\nWhen I publicly make you look like an idiot, on purpose, it's disrespectful. I'm sorry you're not intelligent enough to understand that even though I'm saying the truth, it's still disrespectful. If I'd instead called you directly and explained why you were so wrong, instead of posting it publicly to explain to the whole world that you're not smart enough to grasp this basic concept, then that might not have been disrespectful.", "lmao insulting my intelligence for no reason! nice. peace out and have the day you deserve."]}
