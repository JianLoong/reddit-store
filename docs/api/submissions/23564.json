I have laid very strict ground rules with her and she consistently violates them so I co sisterly tell her to g.t.f.o and call me when you want to play by the rules. I don't let people mess with me or my kid anymore. Not after I escaped the toxic hell of his mother's house.", "Absolutely. I was just referring to what the dad probably meant by being nicer.", "I can imagine arguing with my parents. I can\u2019t imagine blocking them or going NC. I can see dad\u2019s point here, OP could/should have called mom to tell her. NTA though.", ">Maybe I'm more cynical than most, but if OP did actually want to go NC, I wouldn't blame them.\n\nThat would be crazy. Families are complex. The father's obviously just trying to maintain a neutrality.\n\nAlso, a bunch of other people seem to agree; the guy below is talking about you owning a \"bridge burning company.\"", "I would disagree. Wanting someone to change their phrasing doesn't mean that you disagree with them nor side with the other one. He (again) did admit that they were in the right and I would not dismiss that.   \nI agree that the Mom did 'cause a lot of unnecessary hurt and that she deserves the blame, I won't condemn the Dad though.  \nJust because you aren't directly shaming your partner, doesn't mean that you are defending or approving her.   \nAnd i wouldn't say that he is ignoring the fact that she is creating the situation, I would assume that he is aware of it, otherwise he wouldn't have admitted to OP being in the right. Could he have been more outspoken against the action of his wife? Maybe, but for all we know she already got a good amount of (deserved) shit and he probably just wants to calm the situation down.", "Pre-natal vitamins, a pregnancy test box in the garbage can, wife eating less/differently, wife not drinking, who knows. We had a pregnancy test box in our bathroom medicine cabinet when my birth control went weird briefly and my MIL IMMEDIATELY asked if I was pregnant and I IMMEDIATELY asked why she was in my medicine cabinet lmao.", "Not drinking alcohol. In some countries, like UK for example, only people who have medical problems, recovering alcoholics and pregnant women don't drink, apart from a few people that are seen as strange,  so I guess they had dinner together and wife didn't drink wine and it became obvious.", "[I Got 5 On It](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Um1ec6ypk)", "I bet that was unpleasant", "Just silently deleting it would get whispers I'm sure, but probably less calls which seemed to be the priority. \n\nStill think it was an AH way to handle it. Justified AH, no judgement, but probably not the best idea in retrospect. Also in my experience grandparents are really fucking bad with boundaries. Not excusing it nor do I think it should go unchallenged, but just managing expectations.", "There would be some suspicion if it just disappeared but I'd bet way less people reaching out, which is the main thing OP wanted. Absolutely sucks that grandma didn't respect that boundary though. I've dealt with similar.", "Absolutely true. Maybe there's an upside to this horrible situation after all.", "Holy crap this is my husband's family.  I refuse to carer to her, and I act uninterested in her bullshit.  She definitely is the star in her own show, and nobody will say anything because she cries at the drop of a hat. It is nauseating.", "Nope, never played that game with the inlaws.  I made them own their mistakes.  The FIL has no right to talk that way to the OP.", "She didn\u2019t have to publicly say the shit she promised not to publicly say.     Sure he could\u2019ve kept it private, but she\u2019s the one who broke a promise to keep it private.      OP is NTA for sure here.    \n\nThere\u2019s a reason people keep early pregnancies a secret, and this is literally the exact reason.   \n\nThis is 100% his mother\u2019s fault.", "Go you. Go. fucking. you. \n\nI don't want to know anything private, honestly (did I ask that? I'm sorry if you thought that!) I am SO happy you've got a handle on it all. And I'm SO sorry your boy has been through so much. It's crushing, watching our babies go through so much. \n\nBut I had to smile when I read \"I'm not fanning the flames\" followed by \" she earned herself a long-ass break\" haha! You sure are fanning flames, and those flames should be fanned when she gets out of line. Good on you.\n\nMuch love. Have a fabulous day/evening.", "I think it\u2019s refreshing when everywhere else the message is that family is forever and just suck it up out of respect for your parents.", "I swear people on here are so flippant because they have nothing personal at stake. They can form their opinions and bounce, because again any OP real life consequences don\u2019t actually apply to them.", "Technically they really shouldn't come to AITA for advice since one of the rules is \"this is not an advice sub.\" But you are right, coming to the internet for advice is always a huge mistake. People here will suggest the most extreme solutions because it's not their life and therefore they won't have to deal with the consequences.", "Maladjusted!? I feel judged... \n\n(I kid! I'm an old woman, and happy to be called out for my short-comings.)", "Exactly, of course no way to know for sure but most of the respondents probably have no kids, aren't married, etc...", "I agreed with the comment above, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t feel the need to repeat it. My thinking was I\u2019m adding thoughts to it\u2026\n\nThanks for mentioning it though, I\u2019ll check myself re. coming off preachy. Not at all my intention. Cheers\n\nETA: tangent maybe, but the Hemingway app is great for checking text like that, it gives reading age and tone feedback. If anyone else finds it handy\u2026.I use it for projects at work (not Reddit lol).\n\nETA 2: I worked in comms so had people telling me how it came off full time, you get used to it. All to say, I really do mean it when I say thanks for the feedback lol", "Dad is trying to use OP as a meat-shield. \"Your mum is giving me shit, and I need you to stand in front of me\". I'm not even kidding. OP's mother had no right to share the pregnancy news, so she gets what she gets. OP was not obliged to tell her/them about the miscarriage - it's so private and personal, and it's up to them who they tell. OP's mother gets everything that's coming to her, I think.", "Oh no, I saw that. They\u2019re entitled to their opinion. But I stand by mine. I grew up with a narcissist parent and what OP is describing sounds eerily familiar. If people think blocking them (again, I never said NC) is overboard, that\u2019s fine. But from my experience, this probably isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something like this, nor will it be the last. So I don\u2019t think anything from blocking to NC is an overreaction.", "Honestly, yes, families are complex. But parents who need to make things all about themselves? That's a completely different side to 'complex'. it's very very hurtful for the recipients of \"BUT I'M HURTING MORE THAN YOU ARE!\" \n\nseriously", "Oh FFS save us from meddling in-laws.", "My fianc\u00e9's mom is the same way. Her kids were raised not to upset mommy, don't make mommy cry because if she don't get her own way she has a baby tantrum. Or get herself so upset that she's sick. She also cries all the time if she don't get her own way. Interestingly, there aren't any tears and stops crying immediately when she gets her own way. The only one that deserves to be happy is her. The family needs to revolve around that. And how much they love her is far more important than how much she loves them. Which, in my opinion, is around 0%. I think she is the narcissistic mom. Strangely, for such a \"loving\" person and mom, no one can stand being around her.", "I totally agree. \"Toxic families should be appeased\" .. yeah right.", "Hey, you too dude! It's rare to get mutual respect and I appreciate you respecting my boundaries. Much love, have a good 1!", "I think both are wrong and going full blown opposite isn't really refreshing. Just nihilistic. \n\nI have family I don't give two shits about because they never gave two shits about me \n\nBut I also have family who has made massive sacrifices to help me multiple times in my life. \n\nAnd some folks on Reddit think I should be as quick to abandon that second family that has kept me from being homeless, a ward of the state, dead by suicide, any number of places I would be if that family hadn't helped me", "Not necessarily - I mean, I know what you mean, and I get your point, but sometimes, the whole saying about \"If there are 9 racists and you at your dinner table, that means there are 10 racists,\" is true. I might've mis-quoted that haha! \n\nNot accepting these behaviours ends up stamping it out for future generations, I think. If you CAN stop supporting these people (ie, stop accepting their shit and cutting them out), then do it every time. If you can't, like I can't cut off my shitty BiL, then call them out every time, however uncomfortable it makes things. \n\nI'm a bit of a ranter about this stuff, and I'm so sorry.", "Wait...that turned into him deciding to NC?!?! Damn that escalated", "But people here encourage that!  Someone says  something you don\u2019t like?  Scream at them and stand up for yourself!  Then cut them off completely", "If they return to 4chan, the circle is complete.", "I think we got some crossed wires here.  I agree with you about catastrophizing.  My post was about another one of my big peeves here.  I was not trying to accuse you of anything or call you out in any way.\n\nPeace and love", ">Maybe mom will learn to respect people's wishes.\n\nEven Vegas won't touch those odds.", "> She is mad at me for not telling her that we had lost her grandchild.\n\nThat's from the OP. The woman is mad because they didn't tell her SHE lost her GRANDCHILD. Nothing about \"I'm sorry YOU lost YOUR CHILD.\" \n\nI'm actually pretty damn annoyed.", "I actually do agree with NTA - to clarify.\n\n[This was my response to the actual OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15eiscs/aita_for_just_posting_my_wife_miscarried_on_my/ju89czi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)\n\nJust fyi, I didn\u2019t say what to do/go no contact intentionally. Just input. That\u2019s all I meant.\n\nMy response to above was specifically at the general Reddit approach AND the comment above it that is now stoking a fire to the Dad.

It's hard to know when or if I'm over-stepping, to be honest, because I'm a 62 year old grandma, and most of my life, I've been told we're entitled to know everything - you know? So I'm learning, and I totally appreciate you. Thank you. <3", "That's pretty much what I do with my brother-in-law. My sister can't leave the house they co-own, because she has an adult disabled daughter. The house is adapted to her needs. Neither my sister nor BiL can buy the other out - they can't afford it. So, my sister's stuck with a homophobic, sexist, racist fuck. \n\nI've had MANY an argument with him, and I don't put up with his shit. I also don't go to their house that often anymore - the more I rock their boat, the harder it is for my sister. I can just go home when it gets too much; she can't. So, I embarrass the fuck out of him if we're in public and he says something he shouldn't.", "Yup, in the updates", "I'm an older person (62). My generation definitely seems to think it's their news to share. I had to rein in my big sister when she wanted to post some news about her son (my nephew). She was like \"BUT WHY??? I'M PROUD OF HIM!\" and I'm like \"BUT IT'S HIS NEWS! NOT YOURS!\"", "Lots of people of all ages think they, and only they, should have a pass on bad behavior.

Stop her giving me shit by taking her shit.\"", "My first was stillborn. He was the only pregnancy I announced on social media. It was absolutely devastating. My three living kids were announced after they arrived. We didn\u2019t tell ANYONE I was pregnant unless they saw me in person, and we didn\u2019t tell people I was pregnant unless it was extremely obvious. Our parents didn\u2019t find out I was pregnant until 20+ weeks\u2014when it was obvious. And my youngest, who is now 4 months old, wasn\u2019t known to extended family (aunts/uncles/cousins) until he arrived. \n\nSorry not sorry.", "Well, it depends. There's nothing shameful about having a miscarriage, and some people would prefer the social support of their network whole dealing with such a loss. The real lesson is don't go sharing other people's news.", "And in the past 8 years, *it's worked.* The clowns know better than to start spouting off politics around me and pops, lest we put up a tent and really get the show started. There was a period right when Trump won they were insufferable but better believe they're behaved these days.\n\nThey know deep down how wrong they were (are?) and if they give us even an iota of an excuse to tee off we're going to take it. Family gatherings are pleasant again. Reddit, don't let your moron brigade cousins and aunts and uncles chase you off.", "LOL it's like the excitement becomes ownership.  Great on you for pointing it out!", "Oh darlin. Getting commiserations for months from people you know IRL and see once or twice a year is devastating. Extrapolate that effect to social media, and it's ultra-devastating. I am so sorry. I absolutely see why you waited, and good for you. <3", "Yes, I see that. Of course it isn't shameful, and yes, some people will feel comfort by people saying \"I'm sorry for your loss\". But if all you're trying to do is move on, and 'forget' (ie, push it down until you can deal with it), and all you get is people messaging you and messaging you and messaging you... when you didn't want it on social media in the first place? It's shattering.", "Haha thank you! I think my sister has the Matriarch Gate-keeper mentality going on, tbf. When we were younger and didn't have mobile phones, we contacted the Head of the Family (ie, the Matriarch) and she disseminated the News. I outgrew that, but my sister didn't."]}
