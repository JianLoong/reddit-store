All of my other siblings blamed my mom for the divorce and stayed with my dad.\n\nSo a couple months ago my mom passed away and left behind my 12 year old half sister. Since she had no where else to go and since me other siblings wanted nothing to do with her I adopted her. When my father and and siblings heard of this they started to berate me over call and blow up my phone with messages about \"how could you take in the daughter of that women after what she did\" and that kinda stuff.", "created_utc": 1694003549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bj22a/aita_for_adopting_my_half_sister/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is your family.  You have every right to have a relationship with them. \n2. This is a 12 year old child who is in no way responsible for your mother's infidelity. \n3. You mother was still your mother in spite of being unfaithful 12 years ago. They have no business gatekeeping your feelings or relationship with her in the first place. \n\nYour father and siblings seem to lack some basic human compassion. I am glad you have more and hopefully that reflects itself in the home you provide your sister.", "NTA - She's an innocent child.", "NTA\n\nI hope everything works out between you and your kid. \nYour other family just have to get over themselves.", "NTA\n\nAll the best to you and your new family!", "Because the daughter is not at fault for the actions of her parents! They can be butt hurt about you taking in your sister, but at the end of the day that's not their problem. Your sister is a victim just like the others are too. Sorry for the current problems you're in OP. You're a good sister and NTA.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, I think you have approached this in a very mature, compassionate, and above all, admirable way.  Becoming a parent to a child is extremely difficult under the best of circumstances.\n\nPlease make sure you get your half-sibling into therapy.  She just lost her mom and learned that most of her family wants nothing to do with her and either of those will hurt and both together will really devastate a person.\n\nAs far as your family goes, feel free to use their beliefs (like their religious beliefs) to shame them.  How they are acting towards you and this girl is really vile and you should remind them of their lack of charity, lack of humanity, and general lack of character for condemning the child for the sins of the parent.", "NTA\n\nYou are kind and caring.

I didn't really take a side during there divorce as neither were really good parents or good husband and wife. I haven't really been in contact with either of them that much after the divorce since they sort of shipped me off to boarding school when they split up so i would be as close as possible to each off them physically. All of my other siblings blamed my mom for the divorce and stayed with my dad.\n\nSo a couple months ago my mom passed away and left behind my 12 year old half sister. Since she had no where else to go and since me other siblings wanted nothing to do with her I adopted her. When my father and and siblings heard of this they started to berate me over call and blow up my phone with messages about \"how could you take in the daughter of that women after what she did\" and that kinda stuff.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is a child. And your sister. You have every right to have a relationship with her. Your family literally wants you to abandon a child to spite your mother even after her death? Mind blowing.", "NTA but your father and other siblings are.  \nYour half sister isn't just your mother's daughter, she's also your sister and she's only 12 years old. She had nothing to do with your mother's actions and shouldn't be made to suffer just for existing.\n\nI wish you and your new family all the best. You're absolutely doing the right thing.", "Assuming you can provide for the kid\u2019s needs, there are not better options, and you aren\u2019t harming other members of your household by doing so, you are NEVER the AH for adopting a kid.", "NTA. The child did nothing and is your family. That should be enough.", "the 12 year old child did not ask to be the product of an affair, and while it was not something you *had* to do, it was a good thing *to* do. the rest of the your siblings are just gonna have to get over it. NTA just prepare for them to become limited contact.", "your half sister has nothing ABSOLUTLY NOTHING to do with the divorce or infidelity. i am proud of you for being there for her. NTA", "NTA. And you're a good person.", "NTA. It's your decision to make. They don't have to like it, but they also can't tell you what to do nor what should you feel about your mom.", "What! This is terrible. NTA.", "Was never in her life he disappeared when my mom left to be with him", "Be sure that you took all legal precautions needed. Make sure that if he comes back for whatever reason he can't take her away from you.", "NTA\n\nShe is innocent, don't blame the child for transgressions of the parent.  \n\nCongratulations, and best wishes with your new family!", "NTA\n\nWTF they want an innocent kid to suffer for whatever their mother did? Not to mention the kid is related to them. Wow.", "NTA - She's family and a child. You aren't an asshole for saving her from the foster system, quite  the opposite......But is your half sister an affair baby? If so I could see why your other siblings may want nothing to do with her, and why your dad wouldn't want to be around her. It still doesn't make you an asshole, but this would explain their reaction better.", "Nta you are a wonderful person who can look past the fault of the parent and not place blame on the innocent child.", "NTA. You rescued a kid with nowhere to go. Never an AH move.", "NTA. Thank you for not taking it out on a totally innocent child, as your unpleasant family did.", "NTA she's a child, it's wild for them to put your mom's \"sins\" or w/e onto an innocent and now parentless 12 year old.", "NTA and OP you are a good person.", "NTA  Why should your young sister have to suffer because of her mother's actions?  Also, aren't all of y'all her kids?", "Adultery isn't hereditary.  Your half-sister is innocent in the circumstances of her conception, and needed someone to help her.  You were willing, and you are NTA for being so.", "NTA\u2026it isn\u2019t your half sister\u2018s fault and you\u2019re the hero for what you did\u2026the rest of your family sure are though.", "NTA.  What are you supposed to do with her?  Put her in the system?  If that can be avoided, it wouldn't be appropriate to do that to her.  Your family's questioning your decision makes them TA's.  She a 12 year old kid.  *How can you take in the daughter of that woman?*  She's an innocent child & has just lost the only mom she knows.  How can your family be so cold & have no empathy for her?  It's so sad.  Rest assured, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nThat child had no say in how they were conceived. Shame on your family for blaming her for what your mother did. Keep her far away from them until they realize, she was unfortunate in all of this.", "Maybe remind them that they are also the children of \u201cthat woman\u201d. High five for OP!", "yeah she is a affair baby", "I mean her siblings clearly dont like the cheater", "Unfortunately, they probably aren't going to all of a sudden have the attitude that she's a child and completely innocent in all of this, and I'm sorry for the difficulty that  it might cause you. But do know that you are doing a great thing by adopting her, and it's a selfless move (not an asshole move as other family members are saying). I wish you the best!", "But the child is innocent", "I'm sorry for your loss, complicated though it may be.\n\nNTA. I assume you were contacted as a relative and asked if you would take her in. She has nothing to do with any of the old drama. She's just a kid who lost her mom and needs a home. Of your family wants to hold grudges over a grave, they are welcome to go scream into the void all they like. But you are \"that woman's\" child, too, as are your siblings. Your father didn't exactly step up and be a good dad after your mom left and you're still not close. So he's probably not the one to give advice on how to handle kids after traumatic changes.", "NTA. \n\nIt's a wonderful kindness.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is you'd become a bit ludicrous if you started insisting the family to treat her like a kid adopted in conventional circumstances, e.g. attending thanksgiving or claiming inheritance from your father's side.\n\nSome change of title on a government document doesn't magically upturn the social reality, this being your half-sister not your daughter. You will have to learn to compartmentalise these parts of your family life.\n\nThat's going to be really important to remember if you have your own bio-kids later on. Your family aren't going to be arseholes if they want to see them but not your half-sister.", "NTA!! Your half sister is innocent in everything here. She shouldn't be punished for what your mom did. You did a great thing, don't let anyone tell you different.", "NTA. Whatever you're mom did while she was alive, it's unfair of them to hold it against your sister, who is a child.", "Nta. Why punish the child for the mother\u2019s behavior?", "\"how could you take in the daughter of that women after what she did\" \n\nHow dare your father take in the children of that women after what she did. They seem to forget- if they're born from her- she's the one who birthed them too! So if they want an argument, they need to pick a better one. And not pick an argument that hurts a 12 year old!\n\nNTA", "Nta you're a good person for taking in your sister. SHE didn't do anything wrong!", "The child is it innocent they have no rights and no business telling you what you can do with your life and who you choose to adopt they could step away from the plate and see themselves out the door", "NTA. Be sure you contact the relevant government agencies so your sister (and you) can get any financial assistance available. In the U.S., you should also contact your state government. You made the right choice. Block the adults in your family. Why bother with people who resent a child for something they didn't do?", "You sound like a wonderful, caring person.  Your father and siblings, OTOH, don't.  Tune out their BS and devote yourself to supporting your new child at this difficult time in her life.\n\nNTA", "You're NTA. \n\n>When my... siblings heard of this they started to berate me over call and blow up my phone with messages about \"how could you take in the daughter of that women after what she did\"\n\nUm.... aren't your siblings the children of *that woman* as well? Do they detest themselves and each other as much as they do the child whom they are disparaging?", "I mean, there are plenty of other posters on this subreddit who decided not to take in half-siblings conceived in similar circumstances.  And they tend to get judged as NTA.  OP deciding to take in the kid is really stepping up and being the bigger person in the best way possible."]}
