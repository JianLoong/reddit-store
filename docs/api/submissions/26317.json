I haven't really been in contact with either of them that much after the divorce since they sort of shipped me off to boarding school when they split up so i would be as close as possible to each off them physically. All of my other siblings blamed my mom for the divorce and stayed with my dad.\n\nSo a couple months ago my mom passed away and left behind my 12 year old half sister. Since she had no where else to go and since me other siblings wanted nothing to do with her I adopted her. When my father and and siblings heard of this they started to berate me over call and blow up my phone with messages about \"how could you take in the daughter of that women after what she did\" and that kinda stuff.", "created_utc": 1694003549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bj22a/aita_for_adopting_my_half_sister/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mother was still your mother in spite of being unfaithful 12 years ago. They have no business gatekeeping your feelings or relationship with her in the first place. \n\nYour father and siblings seem to lack some basic human compassion. I am glad you have more and hopefully that reflects itself in the home you provide your sister.", "NTA - She's an innocent child.", "NTA\n\nI hope everything works out between you and your kid. \nYour other family just have to get over themselves.", "NTA\n\nAll the best to you and your new family!", "Because the daughter is not at fault for the actions of her parents! They can be butt hurt about you taking in your sister, but at the end of the day that's not their problem. Your sister is a victim just like the others are too. Sorry for the current problems you're in OP. You're a good sister and NTA.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, I think you have approached this in a very mature, compassionate, and above all, admirable way.  Becoming a parent to a child is extremely difficult under the best of circumstances.\n\nPlease make sure you get your half-sibling into therapy.  She just lost her mom and learned that most of her family wants nothing to do with her and either of those will hurt and both together will really devastate a person.\n\nAs far as your family goes, feel free to use their beliefs (like their religious beliefs) to shame them.

I didn't really take a side during there divorce as neither were really good parents or good husband and wife. I haven't really been in contact with either of them that much after the divorce since they sort of shipped me off to boarding school when they split up so i would be as close as possible to each off them physically. All of my other siblings blamed my mom for the divorce and stayed with my dad.\n\nSo a couple months ago my mom passed away and left behind my 12 year old half sister. Since she had no where else to go and since me other siblings wanted nothing to do with her I adopted her. When my father and and siblings heard of this they started to berate me over call and blow up my phone with messages about \"how could you take in the daughter of that women after what she did\" and that kinda stuff.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is a child. And your sister. You have every right to have a relationship with her. Your family literally wants you to abandon a child to spite your mother even after her death? Mind blowing.", "NTA but your father and other siblings are.  \nYour half sister isn't just your mother's daughter, she's also your sister and she's only 12 years old. She had nothing to do with your mother's actions and shouldn't be made to suffer just for existing.\n\nI wish you and your new family all the best. You're absolutely doing the right thing.", "Assuming you can provide for the kid\u2019s needs, there are not better options, and you aren\u2019t harming other members of your household by doing so, you are NEVER the AH for adopting a kid.", "NTA. The child did nothing and is your family. That should be enough.", "the 12 year old child did not ask to be the product of an affair, and while it was not something you *had* to do, it was a good thing *to* do. the rest of the your siblings are just gonna have to get over it. NTA just prepare for them to become limited contact.", "your half sister has nothing ABSOLUTLY NOTHING to do with the divorce or infidelity. i am proud of you for being there for her. NTA", "NTA. And you're a good person.", "NTA. It's your decision to make. They don't have to like it, but they also can't tell you what to do nor what should you feel about your mom.", "What! This is terrible.
