She works 9 to 5, that\u2019s just as time consuming as school and sports. He can do the dishes or his own laundry. Not teaching him to do those things is just preparing him to be a shitty partner to some poor girl in the future. \n\nShe\u2019s also an adult, so you can certainly tell her to move out but you can\u2019t ground her, that was a stupid suggestion and you know that. You don\u2019t get to parent a 19 year old, you\u2019re just hurting your relationship with her. Let her live there or don\u2019t, but stop this stupid squabbling", "ESH! Your daughter is being lazy, however, did you ever teach her these things growing up or did you just do them for her?. At the very least, she should be doing her own laundry, cleaning her own room and cooking her own meals. \n\nYour son should ALSO be doing his own chores. That's how children LEARN to be responsible and develop basic life skills needed as adults.", "NTA. Laughed so hard at the adult living for free at home thinks she should have anywhere near as little work to do as a 14 YEAR OLD CHILD. \n\nOP, you\u2019re setting up a mooch. Good on you for the grounding, and try not to let it get any further than that. Maybe if she wants to be an adult, give her the choice between chores and rent, not to mention the fact that I don\u2019t think she could afford the live-in maid she seems to treat you as", "NTA. But you\u2019ve been doing the cleanup, cooking, and laundry for a 19-year-old?!?! That\u2019s part of your problem. When my kids turned around 13, I made them start doing their own. As a youngster, I had to help with the laundry and chores for as long as I can remember.\n\nBut I digress. At least you\u2019re trying to turn it around. She is a lazy, spoiled mooch, and it\u2019s high time she learned to pull her own weight. Her brother is a child, so his chores should reflect his age. Try not to make the same mistake with him and the younger kids. Teach them how to cook. Start with prepping food and work up from there. Your future children-in-laws will thank you.", "ESH. You could first try not doing her laundry or taking her breakfast in bed before you jump to grounding her. Stop doing \u2018everything\u2019 for her. Children learn what they\u2019re taught. Start teaching your son before he ends up as entitled acting as his sister.", "NTA ~ I don\u2019t agree with letting your kids get to 18 with zero chores or responsibilities around the house, personally. That being said, she is not making an accurate comparison. While she was in high school she had the same expectations as her brother. As long as when he turns 18 / stops going to school his rules change too you are not being unfair. \n\nInsisting she do her own laundry, maintain her space & pick up after herself is the BARE MINIMUM that you could expect. I think collecting a few hundred bucks a month \u201crent\u201d and putting it away for her as a savings account would also be a good idea, but obviously that\u2019s up to you. I think your daughter needs a reality check of what the real world is like.", "YTA. I\u2019m reading your comments & you should have seen this coming.

Why do you think her behavior will suddenly change when she turns 18 or 19? Even now, you\u2019re acting like her servant, making her breakfast & bringing it to her, doing her laundry, etc. You even clean her room? Wth?  Your parents in law have a point. You treat her like a child & then are mad that she acts like one.", "NTA\n\nShe's an adult and she needs to act like one; and that means mommy isn't your maid anymore. Your son is 14.

An adult doesn't get grounded, they get it together or they get out... \n\nAdmittedly, I moved out at 17, so it's incredibly likely I'm biased on this issue, but I also had a job since I was 12, and worked full time when I was in college...

At the very least she should be washing her own laundry, cleaning up after herself and learning how to cook basic meals for herself so that she isn't fully depending on you for that.", "NTA - part of adulting is doing your own laundry, cleaning your own room, cooking your own food - all of that while paying bills. She has a full-time job and is not in school unlike her brother. Let her move out and see what it's like to pay her own way.\n\nAs an aside, to help your son not be the adulting slacker, he should also learn to do his laundry and cook for himself and clean his room and be expected to do this regularly as a part of learning to be a good human in the world.", "NTA.

Time to grow up.", "ESH - You've made it clear you don't make your kids do chores while they are in grade school so I'm not really sure how you expect your now adult daughter to magically know to do the things you've done her entire life for her? Poor parenting on your part. It was YOUR job to teach her adult responsibilities so she could be prepared to take that on when she reached adulthood. Yes daughter needs to step up, but you need to step up and guide her through this. Don't make the same foolish parenting failure with your other children, especially with the boy. Don't make his future partner teach him, or worse don't create a man who expects women to do the chores for him because that's how his SAHM raised him.", "ESH. \n\n1. That your son is \"on the football team and has good grades\" has absolutely nothing to do with not asking him to help out around the house. The fact that he's 14 does (though he should still clean his own room and have some chores or you'll be creating the same situation for the future as you now have with your daughter).\n2. Your daughter is an adult. Deciding to treat her like a willful teenager and ground her is not helping. Treat her like an adult. Don't \"warn\" her she needs to start \"helping\" - **just stop taking care of her**! Meaning: don't clean her room, don't do her laundry, don't cook for her unless it's a special all-family meal and you want to. \n3.

Does she contribute anything to the household finances?\n\nTell your in-laws that an \"independent adult\" pays rent AND does their own dishes, buys their own groceries, cooks their own food, washes their own laundry, etc, and they (the in-laws) can go piss up a rope.\n\nNTA, and good for your husband for siding with you on this.", "At 19, she should be able to look after herself , that's an independent adult .

He should be responsible to keep his own room clean and to do a fair share of household duties, even if it\u2019s limited due to his schedule. Even the 4 year olds should contribute. I think an important part of parenting is to teach children how to be a contributing part of a family. You are failing at this, it doesn\u2019t happen by magic when they turn 18.", "There's a lot going on here, for example you're supposed to be a stay at home mom, so it feels like your trying to push your responsibilities on this kid.\n\nYou also don't say if she contributes to anything else, like bills or pays rent. And if she is, then you're already on a slippery slope.\n\nYou also *are* showing favoritism by not asking your 14 year old to help out as well. I had a full time job on top of regular school work and house chores. Your son can make the time.\n\nESH, a household takes team work, both your son and daughter should have chores.", "ESH.\nShe is lazy, but she's an adult. She can pay rent, and she can act like an adult. She should move out.\n\nYou should expect that she will resent you. You are treating her differently than your son who is younger and hard working. \n\nIt's your house, and you can require her to do things to keep her food and lodging, but she's an adult. You can't ground her. *She's an adult.*", "ESH- I know people will come at me for this but everyone sucks. Your daughter should be at least responsible for herself as she has to be more independent and start acting like an adult but it reads by what you are saying that you never implemented a chore system or never expected her to take care of her own things and you going from 0 to 100% will obviously be met with resistance.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think you are sexist by wanting your daughter to be more independent I can see her jump in logic since in theory he could do chores as well. I started doing chores at 6 years old to a certain extent (clean the table, make sure your toys are picked up, etc.) so the age shouldn\u2019t be an issue. If you don\u2019t want your son to possibly repeat the pattern I would suggest enforcing chores. \n\nAnd I will say you make it sound like her job does not tire her. Trust me some receptionists are almost like personal assistants and depending on the boss or area of work it can be exhausting. \n\nTl DR: she is an AH for not wanting to become more independent and taking advantage of you in a way but you are AH for enabling it in the first place and not teaching her how to be more independent", "ESH.

You start them young with age-appropriate tasks and build as they grow.", "YTA for expecting her to share your duties when you are not expecting the boys of the household to do anything. In my view, you are trying to shape your daughter to be a SAHM because you have no imagination for anything else. You are N T A for not wanting to be your daughter's servant, however.

My general recommandation would be for your daughter to move out, because you are being a bad role model for her.", "Why are you doing all these things for her?  She can make her own breakfast, so stop doing it. She can do her own laundry, so stop doing it. She should have been responsible for cleaning her own room for many years now, so most definitely stop doing that. \n\nNTA for expecting her to carry her weight as an adult getting free room and board, but you need to stop overfunctioning for ALL of your children, not just your daughter. My son is in college, and in the years that he was home, he was responsible for cleaning his own room. I usually did his laundry, but he put it away, and I made a point of making him do his own laundry every so often so I was certain he knew how to do it. Now when he comes home for breaks, he always does his own laundry. I taught him how to cook basic meals, how to stretch his food budget when shopping, how to balance his bank account, and other life skills that I wasn\u2019t always going to be around to handle. \n\nStop being a doormat, and remember your goal is to raise functioning, capable, independent adults, not spoiled, entitled, ungrateful eternal children.", "ESH. stop doing everything for her, make her do it herself. but she's right that if she works full time and her brother is a student, they should both be helping out around the house and not just her.", "YTA for infantalizing your kids and then being shocked when they stay infants. This is your fault. The fact your daughter is acting along with being grounded is, frankly, weird and unhealthy. \n\nYou can set boundaries, not control.

You have made your 19 year old helpless and entitled and are now reaping what you have sowed.\n\nYour son is 14 and no more capable of caring for himself than his 4 year old siblings. What the hell is he gonna do when he\u2019s 19 if he doesn\u2019t know how to clean a toilet, or how often sheets should be washed, or how long meat takes to thaw?\n\nYou need to treat your daughter like an adult. She does her own laundry, she keeps her own space clean, she cleans up her own mess in the common areas. Discuss meals and food. No more breakfast in bed nonsense. You can still make her stuff, if you feel like it, but it\u2019s not an expectation and she eats at the table.\n\nI\u2019m assuming dinner is a family affair and made by you.

As she has an actual job, she likely works harder between the hours of 9 to 5 than he does and many his age are expected to do chores along with maintaining good grades.

School is like work, and good grades are like a good job performance. Chores are a household upkeep, they don't count towards work, but all adults still have to do them", "That's how your daughter got to be as she is. Some chores during school time is good. More during the summer and breaks. You have established you are the live in maid for their first eighteen years.

I do think kids need to start learning to do their own chores around middle school, but that's only my opinion based on what I've read on parenting. I can't tell you how to parent your kids.\n\nI would consider how your kids are going to know how to take care of themselves if they've never actually had to do cooking and cleaning, though. There's also time management to consider: to me, personally, if they don't start working basic housekeeping into their lives in their teens, when they have a full time job, they won't know how to manage time to ensure they can do those chores and still have a social life and balance to their lives. I don't make my kids keep their rooms clean, but they are still expected to help with dishes, cooking, and keeping common areas clean. I'm not the clean-freak my mother was, and I do believe that if a kid wants a messy room, there's no harm in letting them have it (*so long as there's no food or drinks in their rooms*). I do expect my kids to know how to clean things, though, and the older they get the more they can be responsible for. My teen does her own laundry, and recently started wanting to get a rotation on cooking dinners. Her room is still chaos, but she's the main person that gets on all of us to keep the common rooms clean, as well. \n\nThey're your kids, but if they were mine, I would think that you might be being too lax. Again, that's personal perspective, and I'm not saying either of us are correct.

It\u2019s your job to teach your son how to do chores & that teenagers & adults clean up after themselves, not expect someone else to do it. Any 14 year old can do their own laundry & keep their bathroom clean, & neither of those are time consuming chores. True, laundry takes a while to wash & dry, but the human intervention required is only a few minutes at a time.", "Then I don't understand why you're blaming her for not doing chores. You basically raised her to think she didn't have to do any.", "It's not, it's being a good parent and teaching your kid how to function. I mean you clean her room ? And persumedly your sons too?
