I\u2019m not particularly wealthy or comfortable rn; I live in a house share and I can\u2019t wait to have my own place and stability, and can\u2019t really rely on anyone but myself to get me there. \n\nMy friend went back to her parents\u2019 (6000 miles away) after graduation, and spent about a year there living low-key, applying to jobs and planning her move back to the UK. She bagged a fantastically paid job that she was gushing about in a major city, and found a beautiful apartment with a down to earth friend from school. She hasn\u2019t always had much stability so I was ecstatic and super proud to see the situation she created for herself. Needless to say, she was doing much better than me financially. \n\n3 months later, she calls me to tell me she quit her job overnight without a plan as she was overworked (all overtime was entirely her decision), and \u201ccould see her job would soon become outsourced and she\u2019d be let go anyway\u201d. She said she was looking for other jobs that wouldn\u2019t be so taxing; I told her, if you end up getting into a desperate situation you can stay with me until you figure it out. Unfortunately she jumped onto this and said she wanted to leave her apartment because it was too expensive, and wanted to move to a more social houseshare. \n\nFast forward 6 weeks, she came over to stay with me for Easter weekend. She told me that she hasn\u2019t applied to any jobs, informed her landlord she is leaving assuming she will stay with me until she figures things out, and doesn\u2019t have any places to live lined up or tenants to sublet her apartment. She said she has \u00a350 to her name and her family have no idea of her situation; during the weekend she ran out of money and they sent her more, while i heard her lying on the phone to them about her job progress. She also said she has done nothing but drink and get high since she quit, and has spent thousands of pounds on this. \n\nThe weekend went awfully for me. Her behaviour was very jarring; she wouldn\u2019t let me sleep, wanted to drink all the time despite me not wanting to, and wasn\u2019t interested in non-debauched activities. I became fed up of her behaviour after she mortally embarrassed me on a night out by acting like a complete fool. I was exhausted when she left and I don\u2019t want her to stay again soon if this is how it will be.  \n\nBefore she came, I was happy to host her for up to 2 weeks; now, I don\u2019t want to at all. However, she is now relying on staying with me after she vacates the property this Saturday, as she told her landlord she will. She doesn\u2019t have the money to pay another month\u2019s rent, however she acknowledged that her family (who are very wealthy) could bail her out if she needed. She also has family in the city she lives in. \n\nOf course I love and care about her and don\u2019t want her to be in a shit situation, but she created this for herself.

And I think that you're doing both of you a disservice by just writing it off as \"she made this really extreme choice to leave a high-paid job\". \n\nFor instance, having worked in similar jobs, I can tell you that, frequently, the overtime is one of those things that is \"voluntary\" but everyone is expected to do it (especially the juniors), and it harms your chances if you don't, especially if you're in your probationary period.\n\nShe may be going through some shit that she needs your help with.

SHE quit her job.  SHE made herself homeless.  At least you recognize that this is entirely of her own doing.  Stand your ground.  You are not responsible for her bad choices.\n\n\nIf you really want to be a friend, don\u2019t rescue her.  She needs to make her own (better) choices if she wants to live her best life.   It would be one thing if she were TRYING but she\u2019s not.  Neither of you is doing the other any favors by having her live with you.  NTA.  Just say no.", "Nta, this will get worse, better get her out now before shes does any damage. Is she usually thos irresponsible? Does she have a history of that? If so why would you invite such a disaster into your life.", "NTA call her family to come pick her up. Explain she can no longer stay with you and she may need a rehab stay to get off the drugs & alcohol. It is not your responsibility to care for her while she disrupts your life.", "NTA.

What I meant by desperate sitaution was, \"I've applied for every job possible and have absolutely nowhere else to go\", which isn't the case, but totally my bad for not being assertive enough to say that. I hope I don't lose her, but yeah; I cannot do this either.", "No details except her coming for no longer than 2 weeks and I need to see a return ticket bought and paid for before she arrives. She acknowedged after the weekend that us sharing a space for that long \"doesn't work\", so at least I don't think it will be a total shock when I tell her.\n\nAbout mental health: very long story, but the bottom line was she stopped therapy as \"it wasn't working anyway\".

I've taken the brunt of this before and that's why my first thought wasn't, \"perhaps something concerning happened at work that meant she needed to leave\".", "It's pretty on brand, as is the unpredictable behaviour.", "OP honestly it sounds like your friend may have an addiction issue. I would let her know that you can\u2019t allow her to drink and partake during her stay.

I stand by NTA for not wanting that in your life. But from reading all of that, it doesn't sound like she's in control, and regaining it can take a lot of work (which she doesn't seem willing or able to do) and stability (which she may not be able to grasp right now).\n\nYou mentioned some trauma (and I think I can guess what), and nobody has a common response to it; no two reactions are the same. But she reminds me of a former friend of mine who had very similar (not-)coping mechanisms, and it's tiring if you're not on the same wavelength (and just mutually assured self-destruction if you are).\n\nIt's up to you if you want to be an Enabler or not, and it sounds like you don't.

If you know this will turn into a nightmare tell her to leave. If she gets mad and ends the friendship it's on her. If she doesn't have another place to go to that's also on her.

Be there as a friend, but not as a host, especially if she's not going to get help for herself and is being irresponsible.

People don\u2019t just jump from great opportunities like that for no reason, and then start using substances. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s pressuring you to party because she\u2019s trying to run from something by partying and by spending time away from these things.

I'd be kinda concerned she may be having a manic episode", "Then they better get to \"bailing\", cause, uh, girlfriend, you can't stay with me, and to put an exclamation point on it, I'd tell her exactly why.

You don't even need to explain why- a simple \"it won't be possible\" is sufficient.  The bad news is that she probably won't accept the news gracefully but the good news is that you know she has family resources and won't end up homeless.\n\nHer behavior has some hallmarks of a mental health crisis, and if I were her friend I'd encourage her to visit a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist for an evaluation. The impulsivity, binge drinking, reckless spending and trouble sleeping are all markers of mania, which can be caused by several different things.", "NTA\nshe can go to mommy and daddy", "NTA  \n\nBlame someone else.

At the time, I was looking after her and consequently didn't start my own healing until I moved to where I am now (1.5 years ago). I want to support her as I know exactly how it feels to be in her shoes, but it's to my detriment - unfortunately she has been behaving in an erratic and unpredictable way (including with substances) since day 1 of our friendship, this trauma however turned that from recreational use to a coping mechanism. Idk how to support her in this.", "You are right. Maybe it's the kick up the butt she needs.", "Kind of a dilemma, right? You kick her out, it\u2019s gonna get worse. You let her stay and coddle her, it\u2019s not gonna get better. It might help to encourage her to get some professional help to confront the trauma in a healthy way. Additionally, something may have happened in that city which triggered it (or formulated a whole new one) which may have caused this situation. She may not want to acknowledge it. \n\nAre you concerned about her behavior at all?", "Just don't let her stay. At all. Ever. She is disrespectful and a bad friend.

You live in a house share, which means other people with their own opinions about the composition of said flatshare are helping keep a roof over *your* head. You have invited someone into this shared home, and this person is out of control with her drinking and drug use, to the point of keeping you up at night - possibly also others in the flat as well. So, you either get rid of this guest asap, or you may find yourself needing to secure alternative accommodation very soon. And it doesn\u2019t sound like you have wealthy parents to bail you out like your \u2019friend\u2019 does.

Stand firm. Make it clear she can't even visit you. She'll get mad. She'll throw it at you that you promised her. Don't bend, even if you lose a friend over this.
