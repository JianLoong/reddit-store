Not only for the parent and child but for the occupants of the men's or women's room. \ud83e\udd14  It's cool that we're trying to evolve to a more inclusive society but NOT cool to wanna do that by not considering anyone else's viewpoint based on \"if i were the ruler of all things\". Like, if a dad doesn't wanna take his 3 year old daughter into the men's room to see a bunch of stranger's bits but also doesn't want to send them into a bathroom alone where they're maybe afraid to be without a parent, it gets dicey. Because I see both sides. Now, let's say OP was in the WOMEN'S room and this dad walked in with his toddler daughter... see? It's NOT so cut and dried.\n\nEdit: Have cptsd. I get it. I work through fear daily. \ud83d\ude28  Some days are more intense than others. Some days are more successful and some are try again next time. All compassion sent.", "As someone with an invisible disability, OP has a valid need for an accessible bathroom that fits the qualifications of disability. It's not nice to gatekeep.\n\n(Also? Family designated parking spaces are a courtesy not a legal right, unlike disability spaces.)", ">My point is, and OP admitted it, they had a choice and they chose to potentially inconvenience other people. In this case they did. This would make them an A H.\n\nNewsflash: every time you use that bathroom, you're potentially inconveniencing someone too! Because somehow when you and your kid go to the loo, it doesn't mean that no-one else will need it. It's almost like you aren't the main character!\n\nOP had a choice the same way you always have a choice. \n\nThey took the accessible choice when it was available for the same reason you always take the accessible choice when it's available. Because they need it. Because not using it is technically possible but very super uncomfortable, inconvenient - and in their case, damaging to their mental health.", "I'm so sick of people asking if people are in therapy for something, as if being in therapy for one session automatically solves the problem and as if mental illness is not a constant uphill battle.", "Then go to a regular stall. Seven minutes is just something you're going to have to deal with if the person in front of you has one of any number of medical conditions that take a little longer to deal with.", "Nope. The moral argument is in fact identical to the legal one: OP has an invisible disability. Invisible disabilities have just as much legal **and moral** weight as visible disabilities. They are a valid need for an accessible bathroom, and people who try to gatekeep their use are immoral shitbags."]}
