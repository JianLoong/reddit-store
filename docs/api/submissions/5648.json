You sound kind of jealous of her and the relationship she has with your mum to be honest. What\u2019s the reason for your rule? I can\u2019t see why babysitting would be an issue at all?", "Your policy is nonsensical and antithetical to your business. If you fire a reliable and well-liked employee, you are only shooting yourself in the foot. I can't help but feel there is some subconscious jealousy that may be clouding your judgment. \n\nProfessionally it does not serve you to fire her, especially as your mother has said she will get her a job with a competitor. Can you promise she won't poach the kids she babysits to her new location?\n\nYTA", "YTA. It's a dumb rule. Do you have kids yourself? You know that parents might need childcare outside of daycare hours and who better knows their children than Emma? Or you want them to scramble to find a stranger to watch them instead? Let her work.\n\nYou're also very short-sighted because if you fire a great employee that everyone loves, it'll piss off the parents, and good luck going that route. Not the best way to conduct business.", "YTA. \n\nShe's a great employee who goes above and beyond and both the kids and parents love her, but because you are on a power trip you want to fire her. \n\nThese are kids attending your mom's daycare, not students. Sit yo ass down and learn from your mama.", "YTA. I get that it\u2019s policy that employees don\u2019t babysit students, but it kind of feels like you wanted to fire her  anyway and this was just a convenient excuse to finally do it. If she\u2019s an exemplary employee in every other way and no known issues have come up as a result of the babysitting, maybe a warning would have been appropriate before straight up firing her. I mean, times are tough right now and who knows if she really needed the money.", "YWBTA, you kind of sound jealous of Emma.

WIBTA for firing her?\"\n\nPersonally, that's what I read when I read that. What benefit is that policy to begin with? Because the only benefit I see is for you, so that other people don't become more liked than you and start their own business - which if they did, would just be them taking part in the same capitalist system you chose to engage in, so....\n\nYWBTA in this scenario, and I would say some re-evaluation of the situation may help in this case.

This is cruel and ridiculous.", "yta ... you dont give her enough hours ... the hours she was promised btw so she has a side  hustle and honestly unless you are willing to open your daycare for night times when she babysits you dont have a leg to stand on ... im guessing the parents like the consistency of having the same carer aswell", "YTA\n\nWhat motivation does she have not to babysit?  You aren't giving her enough hours to pay her bills\n\nYou say she is an excellent employee and great with kids.  So these are the sort of employees you want to retain.

Pretty sure you know it too. Be better.", "What is the purpose of the policy? As a parent, I preferred babysitters that I was familiar with. \n\nDo you pay Emma when she drives your mother home?\n\nWill this cause a problem between your mother and you?

You seem jealous of her.", "OP, what I hear you saying is that your mom gave you a role as part of preparing you for taking over the business and then she disrespected you and the role by going behind your back, hiring an employee without talking to you and agreeing to a higher salary than you and she agreed would be standard.  \n\nIt sounds to me like you are angry and frustrated with your mother and because you can\u2019t do anything about that you are looking for reasons and opportunities to take it out in Emma. They really infuriating thing is that Emma IS good at the job and was a good call on your mom\u2019s part. \n\nHave you talked to your mom about your frustration about this? Have you talked to a therapist?  \n\nBecause really it sounds like you are planning to fire Emma as a big Up Yours to your mom and as a result you are willing to shoot yourself in the foot over it. \n\nI don\u2019t think what your mom did here was a good business practice. If she wants her business to thrive in your hands she should be including you in these kinds of decisions and explaining what she saw in Emma etc. But throwing a temper tantrum and punishing an employee to make your point isn\u2019t exactly going to earn you any respect. \n\nI don\u2019t see how Emma did anything wrong. You took $100+ a week out of the income she expected when she took the job. She\u2019s staying and doing a good job, but she needs to pay her bills someone that don\u2019t compete with the hours you need her.

You are definitely being an asshole. You don\u2019t get to tell any employee what they can do off your clock. You\u2019re not their owner. This whole situation reeks of you being insecure and needing to feel in control. You sound like an awful boss.", "YTA - You do not own the business YET, so stop acting like you do. Your mom is the owner and ultimately the boss and you are now her employee. If she tells you that she is okay with what Emma is doing, that should be good enough for you. This might be giving your mother second thoughts about letting you take over the business.", "OP you are a heartless Scrooge. I could see if Emma was a lousy employee. She has shown she is a valued employee. You treat her like garbage.  If the children\u2019s parents find out you fired an employee without just cause , your not paying well and she needs work times are tough. You are going to lose your reputation and your business. Shame on you", "YTA.

It\u2019s not your daycare yet, and if your mom is smart enough it will not be yours for a whole lot longer. \n\nYou gave 10 hours, out of 18 your mother promised. You have a great employee and an stupid policy that will only bite you later. She is not stealing students, but babysitting off office hours. You are being petty and jealous of your mom.

Just give her the hours she needs already,", "So you want to fire her and push the parents of 7 children to potentially cut out the middleman (you) and go direct for a nanny share situation, saving them money and costing you business?\n\nYTA, your policy makes zero sense. You aren't open when they need care. She can provide care, and it makes no difference to your business in the current state. Firing her, however, will most definitely make a difference to your business", "Right to work is a type of law to prevent unions from having power.  \n\nAt Will is the law that says you can fire someone for no reason at all.  \n\nKnow the difference, because the people who benefit from these laws love that people don't actually know the law they cite.", "Tons of states and countries have laws that make it illegal to make moonlighting restrictions in the employee handbook.", "Employee policy handbooks aren\u2019t law.", "Why else would he care? There\u2019s a reason many businesses do a noncompete clause. Not because they\u2019re being a hardass, they know they can take information/clients and make their own money.", "that's how low barrier of entry businesses work: like cleaning and daycare. they often try to get their employees to not take their business away from them because its just so easy for the workers to do the business on their own once clients like the way they do the work.", "OPs management style will be detrimental to the kids in the long run. Pay peanuts and you end up with monkeys that couldn't give two shits about the job.", "You spelled *nepotism baby* wrong.", "Not even that, though, because it doesn\u2019t sound like she was babysitting during business hours.", "Sounds like OPs daycare is only open during regular hours. Such as 7am-6pm M-F and the parents are needing care during the night or weekend for events like date night and such when they want to be away from their children.", "Depends on where OP is. I\u2019m in KY and my last two jobs restricted this. Both were govt employers and I could not work anywhere that either my agency regulated like a nursing home or group home for example and I couldn\u2019t work anywhere doing the same job I was doing because of potential conflicts.", "My kids daycare encourages the teachers to work as babysitters for parents. They aren\u2019t setting up their own daycare center, obviously. They are providing a service that makes parents and staff happy. Also, your 100% figure is what I am referring to as what you made up. Hyperbole is an ineffective persuasion technique, because it is so obviously based on ignorance.", "Do you think these teachers are setting up their own daycare centers? That is just a ridiculous assumption.", "Same, I can\u2019t get paid to tutor students taking my classes, I should just be teaching them in class. I can tutor kids who aren\u2019t my students though.", "At home daycares, some do. Even just a couple of kids can make or break a daycare. \n\nYoure being the idiot if you dont understand that business."]}
