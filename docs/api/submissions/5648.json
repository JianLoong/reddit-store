You sound kind of jealous of her and the relationship she has with your mum to be honest. What\u2019s the reason for your rule? I can\u2019t see why babysitting would be an issue at all?", "Your policy is nonsensical and antithetical to your business. If you fire a reliable and well-liked employee, you are only shooting yourself in the foot. I can't help but feel there is some subconscious jealousy that may be clouding your judgment. \n\nProfessionally it does not serve you to fire her, especially as your mother has said she will get her a job with a competitor. Can you promise she won't poach the kids she babysits to her new location?\n\nYTA", "YTA. It's a dumb rule. Do you have kids yourself? You know that parents might need childcare outside of daycare hours and who better knows their children than Emma? Or you want them to scramble to find a stranger to watch them instead? Let her work.\n\nYou're also very short-sighted because if you fire a great employee that everyone loves, it'll piss off the parents, and good luck going that route. Not the best way to conduct business.", "YTA. \n\nShe's a great employee who goes above and beyond and both the kids and parents love her, but because you are on a power trip you want to fire her. \n\nThese are kids attending your mom's daycare, not students. Sit yo ass down and learn from your mama.", "YTA. I get that it\u2019s policy that employees don\u2019t babysit students, but it kind of feels like you wanted to fire her  anyway and this was just a convenient excuse to finally do it. If she\u2019s an exemplary employee in every other way and no known issues have come up as a result of the babysitting, maybe a warning would have been appropriate before straight up firing her. I mean, times are tough right now and who knows if she really needed the money.", "YWBTA, you kind of sound jealous of Emma.

You aren't giving her enough hours to pay her bills\n\nYou say she is an excellent employee and great with kids.  So these are the sort of employees you want to retain.

Pretty sure you know it too. Be better.", "What is the purpose of the policy? As a parent, I preferred babysitters that I was familiar with. \n\nDo you pay Emma when she drives your mother home?\n\nWill this cause a problem between your mother and you?

They really infuriating thing is that Emma IS good at the job and was a good call on your mom\u2019s part. \n\nHave you talked to your mom about your frustration about this? Have you talked to a therapist?  \n\nBecause really it sounds like you are planning to fire Emma as a big Up Yours to your mom and as a result you are willing to shoot yourself in the foot over it. \n\nI don\u2019t think what your mom did here was a good business practice. If she wants her business to thrive in your hands she should be including you in these kinds of decisions and explaining what she saw in Emma etc. But throwing a temper tantrum and punishing an employee to make your point isn\u2019t exactly going to earn you any respect. \n\nI don\u2019t see how Emma did anything wrong. You took $100+ a week out of the income she expected when she took the job. She\u2019s staying and doing a good job, but she needs to pay her bills someone that don\u2019t compete with the hours you need her.

You are definitely being an asshole. You don\u2019t get to tell any employee what they can do off your clock. You\u2019re not their owner. This whole situation reeks of you being insecure and needing to feel in control. You sound like an awful boss.", "YTA - You do not own the business YET, so stop acting like you do. Your mom is the owner and ultimately the boss and you are now her employee. If she tells you that she is okay with what Emma is doing, that should be good enough for you. This might be giving your mother second thoughts about letting you take over the business.", "OP you are a heartless Scrooge. I could see if Emma was a lousy employee. She has shown she is a valued employee. You treat her like garbage.  If the children\u2019s parents find out you fired an employee without just cause , your not paying well and she needs work times are tough. You are going to lose your reputation and your business. Shame on you", "YTA.

It\u2019s not your daycare yet, and if your mom is smart enough it will not be yours for a whole lot longer. \n\nYou gave 10 hours, out of 18 your mother promised. You have a great employee and an stupid policy that will only bite you later. She is not stealing students, but babysitting off office hours. You are being petty and jealous of your mom.

The worst part is that daycare's have to exist and, thanks to rules, regulations, and insurance, the profit margins are very slim (at least for those that follow the rules). Hell some states are requiring that \"head teachers\" have college degrees.\n\nOn expenses:\n\n1. Insurance for childcare providers is stupid. Easily 50-60%, and sometimes more, of total revenues go to that.\n2. Increasing rents aren't just impacting residential customers. Many strip malls and other places run shorter leases, which means vulnerability to increases you don't see in office buildings.\n3. Many providers accept state money (in those that offer it), which is usually less than the full cost and are not able to charge the parent for the remaining balance.\n4. Especially during a recession you have parents that won't or can't pay for weeks at a time. Some just stop paying entirely. This money is usually unrecoverable. Folks would be surprised at the number of people that float from daycare to daycare while never paying a cent.\n5. After rent and insurance, utilities and employee pay are usually the next highest line items.\n6. Most states have mandated ratios of teachers to kids. So, for example, some require 4 kids to 1 childcare professional. You have 5 kids in a room? 2 people minimum. That doesn't take into account floaters needed to provide breaks.\n7. OP is right in some comments: many daycare facilities are seeing reductions in income due to the expansion of free preschool provided in elementary schools (which I think is a great program).\n8. On top of all that the fixed costs (insurance, rent, utilities) don't care about how much the people in the neighborhood can afford to pay. There's a ceiling for every area and you cannot realistically charge more than that.\n\nOn staff policy:\n\nIt makes a lot of sense. Let's say something happens to a kid while a daycare teacher is watching them after hours. **Just one example I've seen first hand:** word gets out that little Timmy broke his arm while Jane from Woodside Daycare was watching him through no fault of Jane's. Turns out Jane smoked a bit of pot before going to watch Timmy. Jane gets ticketed for possession. Guess what: the 3 cops that have their kids at the center pull their kids and others do too when they find out.\n\nThen, with the reduction of children the daycare is forced to get rid of 2 teachers that are no longer needed and cannot be supported.\n\nI generally support laws that prevent workplace rules against moonlighting, but there are some very specific circumstances that I support those kinds of policies. Generally those are positions/businesses that require levels of trust (so cops shouldn't be able to moonlight as security IMO).\n\nESH.

It's standard daycare rules and it makes a lot of sense. The second the employee walks into a child's home the dynamic changes. I've seen so many day care workers start favoring that child, becoming too close with the parents, so on. It no longer is a work relationship and the lines are crossed. Next thing you know your daycare teacher is taking the kid home to babysit after school, and that is now a liability issue that they are leaving with the child. People also don't realize child care in someone's home is personal and it can also not be the best idea for the parent. It sucks not making enough money but if the employee agreed to those hours then that's not the employers fault. \n\n\nAnd yes, I have worked in day care and I also have a child so I get both sides.", "You said \"she's a great employee\".

The ones who made her an offer she couldn't refuse?? Can you afford to lose them?

After all, your employee seems competent and honesty she probably will be snapped up by another family or maybe several families willing pay her. I saw that happen at my child\u2019s daycare.

She is legal clear", "> On staff policy:\n> \n> It makes a lot of sense. Let's say something happens to a kid while a daycare teacher is watching them after hours. Just one example I've seen first hand: word gets out that little Timmy broke his arm while Jane from Woodside Daycare was watching him through no fault of Jane's. Turns out Jane smoked a bit of pot before going to watch Timmy. Jane gets ticketed for possession. Guess what: the 3 cops that have their kids at the center pull their kids and others do too when they find out.\n\nAlso I was thinking 'what if employee who is moonlighting babysitting hours ends up getting involved with a parent while moonlighting' or 'what if employee while moonlighting overhears/witnesses something that while not illegal or reportable, can/will be spread by gossip and potentially damage the family's reputation'?\n\nIn those situations I can very clearly see why it'd be important to have a separation of business and personal time. The policy doesn't say she can't babysit, just that she can't sit kids who are part of the program. Limiting any potential backlash against the company. Because promoting that your company vets their employees to be good people then later finding out that outside of business hours they have a touch of klepto, the parents might turn towards the business for having hired such a person because they used the daycare program as vetting for a personal babysitter.\n\nTons of potential landmines could/would crop up, in which parents firing their personal babysitter could cause them to take their kids out of the program itself.\n\nDo gotta say though, 10 to 18 hours a week feels like pretty low hours but I don't know what the standard shift would be or what the actual pay is.", "As an elementary teacher, part of our safeguarding training is not to have any interactions with students outside the school setting unless there is a pre-existing relationship/reason (such as attending the same religious institution, close friends with the parents, etc.).
