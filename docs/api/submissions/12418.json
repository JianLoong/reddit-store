For the past 7 years, I\u2019ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. \n\nHowever, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I\u2019ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that\u2019s what my mother would have wanted. \n\nI said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. \n\nWhen I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. \n\nMy brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. \n\nBut I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn\u2019t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves. \n\nSo, AITA for not giving money to A or allowing A to stay in my apartment?", "created_utc": 1678948778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11smf0y/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom made wise choices with her money and invested in an apartment. That is an amazing thing to do for you. Plus life insurance to ensure you were taken care of. Your mom loved you very much and wanted these things for you. When you buy life insurance, you have the option to split the money between several beneficiaries and you can change the choices anytime.

You are correct: If your mom wanted your aunts to have money, she would have left them some, or at least told you to share some. You are under no obligation to share.

My dad went through it with his brothers and it's starting to happen with my siblings. \n\nYou need to look out for you.

I\u2019m gonna say legally your aunts have no say or right to the estate of your mum unless she specified it in her will. If not, you are quite rightly the heirs and your aunts can go and get lost.
