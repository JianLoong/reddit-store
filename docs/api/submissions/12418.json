For the past 7 years, I\u2019ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. \n\nHowever, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I\u2019ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that\u2019s what my mother would have wanted. \n\nI said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. \n\nWhen I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. \n\nMy brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. \n\nBut I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn\u2019t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves. \n\nSo, AITA for not giving money to A or allowing A to stay in my apartment?", "created_utc": 1678948778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11smf0y/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance/", "score": 322, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom made wise choices with her money and invested in an apartment. That is an amazing thing to do for you. Plus life insurance to ensure you were taken care of.

You are correct: If your mom wanted your aunts to have money, she would have left them some, or at least told you to share some. You are under no obligation to share.

My dad went through it with his brothers and it's starting to happen with my siblings. \n\nYou need to look out for you.

He just asked me where my husband kept his tools. I was so glad when sister divorced that ah!\n\nYour Aunts are out for what they can get.

Unfortunately having had to deal with inheritance issues as well, I wouldn't cut them off if I came to the conclusion that they really believed their BS (it's easy enough for one person to convince herself of something, if there are two of them supporting each other delusional ideas...), but might cut them off if I came to the conclusion that they're just trying to guilt trip you by convincing you of something they known is false and are only acting out of greed and jealousy.\n\nOf course it depends also on how much you otherwise like your aunts.", "Nta respect your mother s will", "Listening to your brother on this one.

Screw those people.\n\nFor my part- I will say that particular situation applied to both of my grandparents and later, my mother herself.\nIt was extremely painful for me and for all 3 of them in their own times.  They were all abandoned by everyone else but me.  Not one of my family could be bothered.... \n\nUnknown to me, my grandparents had quietly changed their wills according to who was clearly putting $$$$$ over anything else.

It's also not a good way to manage it. \n\nYour mom helped her sister when your mother was alive. Now that she has passed, I'm sorry for your loss, she was thinking of her children.
