I used to shoot a text 'hey, Im doing laundry. Can you move your stuff\" and if they don't, then I do. NTA but what's up with communication?", "NTA\n\nIt is common knowledge in shared laundry spaces that if you leave it in the dryer (or even washer) for an extended period of time then you can expect to find it on top of the machine.  You're kind enough to put it in a basket for her!  \n\nShe's the AH for making you feel like a jerk for wanting to utilize the dryer.", "NTA. when you have shared laundry you have to be respectful of the fact that other people need to use the machines.  If you leave you're shit in the dryer for an extended period of time, it should be expected that it would be moved out.  You were nice enough to put it in a bin *you* provided.\n\nOut of curiousity, she said \"this is your last warning\" but had she even warned you before that?\n\nI hope your new schedule works out, but you have absolute NBTA here.", "I've thought about it but she's got a daughter and I would never stop beating myself up if I threw out a little girls clothes.", "Well we've had issues previously where she requested that I not message her about conflicts anymore and just go through our landlord but he's a lazy AH so I don't really feel like contacting him about it all.\nI did tell her tonight but only after I had moved her laundry already and that was what sparked the debate again", "Yeah this is probably the 5th or 6th time I've had to move her things in order to get mine done.\nSo she's \"warned\" me and explained that she doesn't want me touching her things before this.\n\nI just explain to her that I will continue to do it when it's in my way and that I'm not trying to be an AH lol", "Then I would suggest taking the little one\u2019s clothes out and setting them to the side and just put the mom\u2019s clothes in the dumpster.\n\n(I\u2019m just kidding ofc. But she really is acting like an entitled asshole lol)", "yeah you're not TAH in this scenario. I'm guessing she's never lived in a place with shared facilities before, but she can't just leave her shit in the dryer and expect nobody to move it.", "Haha that's some dedication!", "Thank you, I appreciate the clarity."]}
