Today Lucy texted me that she is having another girl. I was excited for her. Lucy then proceeded to tell the one woman in her life with fertility issues how disappointed she is. How she\u2019s not excited about this at all. I kinda just lost it. I didn\u2019t say anything when she was complaining about the \u201csign\u201d of the baby and how she wanted a cancer or some bs (I can\u2019t remember). I told her I couldn\u2019t with her. I said, \u201c you are having ANOTHER healthy baby and you\u2019re complaining about the sex and you\u2019re mad it\u2019s another girl?\u201d Then I told her to \u201cgo complain to someone who will have more fucking sympathy\u201d because she won\u2019t get it from me. Lucy told me she has a right to complain about her own life. But honestly I don\u2019t think she remembers who the hell she is talking to. She knows my whole past with this and she tells others about MY infertility. Which I have never told her not to but you would think common sense right. So that\u2019s on me. She told me if I can\u2019t support her then she no longer wants me in her life. I\u2019m more then willing to help her with this pregnancy but I will not support her in complaining about a healthy baby. \nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693508492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166jrm2/aita_for_not_supporting_my_friend_and_her/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know why someone would ever go to a friend they know has fertility issues and complain about their current pregnancy.", "Your friend, Lucy, didn't read the room.\n\nAs your best friend, she should be aware of your fertility problems, and complaining about this pregnancy is  not a good sign that she is aware of what is happening our life.\n\nNTA.", "I do think you were somewhat rude, but I also think in this context rudeness was completely understandable. So NTA. \n\nBut I'm not convinced Lucy's threat about no longer wanting you in her life if you can't support her is a bad thing. Lucy is upset about you not supporting her in her disappointment even after you made reference to your losses. Even *if* Lucy *had* forgotten who she was talking to, that was the point she should have had an *oh shit* moment and apologised, not doubled down with a comment about *her* not wanting *you* in her life.", "I was talking about astrology. I wouldn\u2019t wish cancer on anyone. I did try to stop the conversation and she did continue your. I told her to just stop talking to me and then she continued. I should have wrote that in.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did was insensitive, and she should know how to read a room at this point.  If you lose your friendship over it, so be it.", "NTA. You are uniquely unqualified to be the person she complains about her pregnancy to, and common sense should have told her that. \n\nEspecially when her complaints are this petty.", "It's a shame that poor little girl is unwanted already.  :(  NTA.", "NTA. Lucy is super tone deaf and can see how her none-sense bs was so triggering! I know you\u2019d do anything for any star sign baby, boy, girl, non-binary after years off losses & to see someone complain about such unimportant details when theyre having a healthy baby (& have children at home already) is shocking & annoying. I hope you get your rainbow baby in your arms someday very soon!", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't personal when she was complaining and she does have a right to complain...until you reminded her how difficult it was for you to hear about these things.\n\nIt's up to you if you want to continue with your friendship, you can put it on hold for now.", "NTA! Your 'friend' is... something else. I am so sorry for your issues with fertility. That is a hard road to travel and your friend not having the common sense, empathy, decency or simple manners to not complain to you is beyond insensitive. She is selfish and should absolutely watch what she says about her own baby. You're not the AH here, she is. You did nothing wrong. The fact that she tells your private business is also disturbing to say the least. Time to reevaluate this friendship.", "YTA. Lucy sounds like she is having some majour mental health issues and that's the way you respond?", "YTA not for not listening, but rather how you handled it. I in no way agree with her complaints, and if it was indeed her wanting it to be cancer, have a disgusting taste in my mouth that anyone would wish for that, based on seeing what cancer does to people. But ultimately\n\n1) Just like not getting pregnant is a hard thing for you and you experience some level of envy there, the other side has some pretty valid complaints. Pregnancy is exhausting. It's draining. It alters your body forever. And it's hard. And while technically there can be options to not go through with a pregnancy, it's off the table for some people due to a variety of reasons. She still deserves some level of empathy for this difficult thing, and her hormones are also going to be having an effect. \n\n2) You jumped down her through with rudeness. You didn't try to distance yourself (based off what you have provided) or end the conversation. You went to insulting her and swearing at her. A better way to approach it would have been. \"Hey, i'm not in a good head space to be a sympathetic ear in this situation. I would prefer to not be a sounding board with this particular line of conversation.\"\n\nMy answer is based strictly on HOW you handled it. Not that you can't be a sympathetic friend in this situation. It's tough. But rather your approach to it.", "Does everyone have to tip toe around you? This is why so many people don't like talking about fertility issues because people of like you. But at least you don't have to worry about her complaining to you anymore since it seems like she's done with you.\n\nYTA.", "ESH here. You both sound insufferable as friends. \n\nYour primary personal excuse for blowing up on the phone wouldn't hold up to the therapist you probably refuse to get. In how you perceive things, you're making it about yourself towards someone who *should* get a talking to for her own reasons. \n\nYour friend hates her child already. Obvious asshole. Just abort and try again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I read it as before confirming it was a pregnancy, seeing the signs of it being that and hoping it was disease. And like that would be majorly disgusting. Hopefully OP can edit and clarify that.", "Until that baby is born healthy, there's no guarantee it's a healthy baby. Are chances high if there's no sign right now? Yeah. But things can get missed.\n\nAnd emotions are high in this. Hormones out of whack. She might be complaining now, and perfectly fine in a week or a month. Like, people are allowed to be disappointed.
