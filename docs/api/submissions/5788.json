You see it as respect to not eat someone else's lunch, and other people (including the other people OP lives with whose opinions matter more in this scenario than ours) find it unthinkable to tag food as \"for me only\". No one is wrong, it's just a different approach to a shared fridge. And since OP has clearly made this request and been rebuffed, unless he wants to get divorced it would make sense to just buy more of all of these things to account for other people eating them. Is that necessarily \"right\"? No. But when you're part of a family sometimes you have to make concessions.

Keep a stash of snacks in your car at least.", "So I don't disagree with you that you shouldn't \"have\" to check, but clearly you do at least to a certain degree. Some people grow up in households where it's fine for certain people to have certain foods just to themselves, and for others that's a complete foreign concept. Since your wife and stepkids are the latter, you both have to work together to find something that works for everyone. Can you just buy extra of everything to account for whatever might get eaten? I'm not sure how you split finances, but if you wife buys groceries for everyone then there's a shared pool for that at least. So use that shared pool to buy your work lunches and get some extras. If you buy 5 to get through the week, get ten or however many you think makes sense. You're NTA for your request, but it's clearly not being accepted so you work outward from there. Does that suck? Sure, but unless you want to divorce over it trying to change their minds is probably not useful.", "It's rude for them to eat your stuff when you've asked them not to, but I do think you've landed on the right solution, to just get more of that food.

Also for your peace of mind not needing to worry each morning. \n\nAs far as consideration goes, I would offer that \"consideration\" of things like this is very subjective. Clearly not in this thread, but reddit isn't the world. Neither the home I grew up in, my home with my partner now, or his childhood home ever had a \"tagged food for only me\" approach. I was an adult before I even hard that it was a thing and it's pretty difficult for me to wrap my head around when the option of \"buy more of that thing to account\" is there. I don't consider that inconsiderate, though I guess others do. But I would consider it inconsiderate if my partner bought a bunch of food taking up space in the fridge that I wasn't allowed to eat instead of just buying extras for me too. So, in short, my point here is I wouldn't necessarily take stock in all the comments telling you that you need couple's counseling or that your wife and stepkids seem \"horrible\" because of this one thing.", "Sorry, you think this man should get a divorce because he and his wife disagree about how food is dispersed in the house?", "Often, the small things are very revealing. They do say not to sweat the small stuff.

The hubby works a 20minute drive from town- and we live another 10 minutes from the town. He doesn\u2019t have time to \u2018run for lunch\u2019 or any other nonsense. \n Before this job, he was active duty military in a jet engines shop/flight line/test cell, and it was the same. Time for a snack, time for lunch, and that\u2019s it. \n He asks for things for his snacks and lunch, and I provide them, and the kids know that if they want to take one it\u2019s fine, but to not take the last of whatever it is. \n\nIf you can\u2019t eat on whatever is in the house, and they can\u2019t respect not eating all of your food that you can\u2019t just go get more of if you don\u2019t bring it with you, they need an attitude adjustment. \nGood move keeping your lunch foods apart, and if they can\u2019t respect that, it\u2019s time for some counselling and/or communication with someone other for them to see the actual problem", "I agree that you are not being unreasonable with your requests. I don't understand the lack of respect and consideration from your family knowing your situation. My husband only likes to drink one particular thing and although he has no issues with sharing, everyone respects his drinks and will only have one on occasion if there is plenty, but if his stash is running out, they won't touch it.

The first time it happens he\u2019s N T A, but since the problem is so easily fixed he becomes the asshole. \n\nIt\u2019s like driving around town with your gas tank constantly 10 miles from empty. You run out of gas once that kinda sucks, but if you keep running out of gas when does it become your fault?", "Ding Ding Ding. NTA. Eat our lunch.", "Exactly.

Of course he could supplement it with a ziplock with some fresh baby carrots or whatever from home but there are plenty of non-perishable Hugh protein/fibre options that he could keep in his car as backup so he\u2019s not starving. \n\nIt\u2019s what I did when my asshole roommates wouldn\u2019t stop eating my lunch crap when I worked in a biosecure facility (and also when I was working in a major hospital literally about as far away as one could get from any sort of cafeteria or food supply, not ideal when you have to eat in ten minutes increments). \n\nHe\u2019s NTA but it\u2019s clearly an argument he\u2019s not going to win so it might be time to try and find a workaround.", "He never once said \" Family \".

Do not eat this new food I bought for me.\"* This would give them the ability to follow the rules without having to admit to guilt for accidentally breaking the previous rules.", "NTA my husband's work is the same way. I never eat the last of anything in the house so that he can take it for lunch. I don't eat leftovers ( texture issue so works for me anyway) if the peanut butter is running low i won't touch it so he can make a sandwich until i can run to the store.  I certainly try not to touch his lunch meats.  Though i might snick a salami or turkey slice here and there. It's just common courtesy.  \n\nI even tell off my 2.5yo for snagging her big sister's lunchables. My 5yo doesnt always like the school lunches and she'd eat the yogurt plates at school and come home half starved. So I bought a lot of them for a quick lunch(she can't have pbjs at school) on \"nothing she wants to  eat at school\" days or after school meal and the 2yo tries to steal them solely for the candy inside, ruining the entire lunchable. \n\nYour wife and step child have food boundary issues.", "Nta and it sounds weirdly controlling?

I\u2019m sorry their behavior towards you is so inconsiderate and rude.", "NTA. Perhaps store your stuff at work (if you can).

Which would mean no money. So for every day that someone takes something from my lunch, it will be as if I didn\u2019t go to work that day = less of my money for you to spend. Maybe that way you will understand the relevance of not stealing my food.\u201d\n\nThere would be various ways to try to deal with this if it was just about the step kids showing their aggression by deliberately fucking with your food. \n\nBut your wife is also being strangely selfish about this. \n\nI\u2019m finding it impossible to imagine that this is an isolated thing from her - if she is happy to disrespect you in this, she will be doing it more generally in many other areas of your life. \n\nWhy are you with someone who does not respect you? Because without respect there isn\u2019t love.  \n\nThere\u2019s not enough info to know why she\u2019s like this - maybe you guys have been fighting for years & she is angry with you & it\u2019s all 50:50 in the big picture, and you know divorce is imminent. \n\nBut if it\u2019s earlier in your relationship & you\u2019re unaware of any particular issues between you, then it sounds like she\u2019s with you for some kind of practical benefits (is it the money?
