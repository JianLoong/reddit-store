You see it as respect to not eat someone else's lunch, and other people (including the other people OP lives with whose opinions matter more in this scenario than ours) find it unthinkable to tag food as \"for me only\". No one is wrong, it's just a different approach to a shared fridge. And since OP has clearly made this request and been rebuffed, unless he wants to get divorced it would make sense to just buy more of all of these things to account for other people eating them. Is that necessarily \"right\"? No. But when you're part of a family sometimes you have to make concessions.

Some people grow up in households where it's fine for certain people to have certain foods just to themselves, and for others that's a complete foreign concept. Since your wife and stepkids are the latter, you both have to work together to find something that works for everyone. Can you just buy extra of everything to account for whatever might get eaten? I'm not sure how you split finances, but if you wife buys groceries for everyone then there's a shared pool for that at least. So use that shared pool to buy your work lunches and get some extras. If you buy 5 to get through the week, get ten or however many you think makes sense. You're NTA for your request, but it's clearly not being accepted so you work outward from there. Does that suck? Sure, but unless you want to divorce over it trying to change their minds is probably not useful.", "It's rude for them to eat your stuff when you've asked them not to, but I do think you've landed on the right solution, to just get more of that food.

Also for your peace of mind not needing to worry each morning. \n\nAs far as consideration goes, I would offer that \"consideration\" of things like this is very subjective. Clearly not in this thread, but reddit isn't the world. Neither the home I grew up in, my home with my partner now, or his childhood home ever had a \"tagged food for only me\" approach. I was an adult before I even hard that it was a thing and it's pretty difficult for me to wrap my head around when the option of \"buy more of that thing to account\" is there. I don't consider that inconsiderate, though I guess others do. But I would consider it inconsiderate if my partner bought a bunch of food taking up space in the fridge that I wasn't allowed to eat instead of just buying extras for me too. So, in short, my point here is I wouldn't necessarily take stock in all the comments telling you that you need couple's counseling or that your wife and stepkids seem \"horrible\" because of this one thing.", "Sorry, you think this man should get a divorce because he and his wife disagree about how food is dispersed in the house?", "Often, the small things are very revealing. They do say not to sweat the small stuff.
