You see it as respect to not eat someone else's lunch, and other people (including the other people OP lives with whose opinions matter more in this scenario than ours) find it unthinkable to tag food as \"for me only\". No one is wrong, it's just a different approach to a shared fridge. And since OP has clearly made this request and been rebuffed, unless he wants to get divorced it would make sense to just buy more of all of these things to account for other people eating them. Is that necessarily \"right\"? No. But when you're part of a family sometimes you have to make concessions.

Some people grow up in households where it's fine for certain people to have certain foods just to themselves, and for others that's a complete foreign concept. Since your wife and stepkids are the latter, you both have to work together to find something that works for everyone. Can you just buy extra of everything to account for whatever might get eaten? I'm not sure how you split finances, but if you wife buys groceries for everyone then there's a shared pool for that at least. So use that shared pool to buy your work lunches and get some extras. If you buy 5 to get through the week, get ten or however many you think makes sense. You're NTA for your request, but it's clearly not being accepted so you work outward from there. Does that suck? Sure, but unless you want to divorce over it trying to change their minds is probably not useful.", "It's rude for them to eat your stuff when you've asked them not to, but I do think you've landed on the right solution, to just get more of that food.

Also for your peace of mind not needing to worry each morning. \n\nAs far as consideration goes, I would offer that \"consideration\" of things like this is very subjective. Clearly not in this thread, but reddit isn't the world. Neither the home I grew up in, my home with my partner now, or his childhood home ever had a \"tagged food for only me\" approach. I was an adult before I even hard that it was a thing and it's pretty difficult for me to wrap my head around when the option of \"buy more of that thing to account\" is there. I don't consider that inconsiderate, though I guess others do. But I would consider it inconsiderate if my partner bought a bunch of food taking up space in the fridge that I wasn't allowed to eat instead of just buying extras for me too. So, in short, my point here is I wouldn't necessarily take stock in all the comments telling you that you need couple's counseling or that your wife and stepkids seem \"horrible\" because of this one thing.", "Sorry, you think this man should get a divorce because he and his wife disagree about how food is dispersed in the house?", "Often, the small things are very revealing. They do say not to sweat the small stuff.

They have no respect for you  and they don't deserve it from you.", "It's not about the Iranian yogurt or whatever the catchy phrase is.\n\nYour wife and stepdaughter are stomping all over reasonable boundaries and gaslighting you when you object. Get a second fridge, use the one in the basement, whatever you need to do. If they continue to complain, it might be time to reevaluate the nature of your relationship going forward.", "Yeah, Huge Ad is right. NTA This specific situation is ridiculous and annoying, but indicates a deeper lack of basic respect for you.", "My petty ass would be eating all the cheese sticks every day.  Lactose intolerance be damned.  But for real, it\u2019s just common courtesy to make sure you have enough of the items you need to pack your lunch. You\u2019re NTA.", "> but that was an asshole move too I guess\n\nNo.  It wasn't.  The only AH moves are from your family not respecting your wishes.", "Something is off in your household. Your wife buys groceries for everyone in the home except for your lunch? Is that by design like you WANT to pick your stuff out, or if you add your lunch items to her grocery list does she refuse? I can't say I've ever heard of one spouse having to buy their weekly meal separately unless there's some serious dysfunction going on.", "Similar schedule here, and I'm allergic to milk and avoid gluten so I can't buy anything when I'm at work I could eat. As a result I'll take lunch in, but I'll also keep a jar of pb, a couple of bananas and crackers in my work bag, with nut bars and satsumas. This is my emergency lunch provision. I'll often buy lunch food that gets eaten before I set off for work by my son having a midnight feast (TBF he works mainly late shifts). So it's helpful to have the emergency backup. It saves a lot of grief. Plus lots of teenagers in the house = plague of locusts. They eat like gannets, so no food will be sacred.", "Haha, another member of the bedroom snack club! My older kids are teenagers and I have had to resort to storing the younger ones' packed lunch stuff under my bed \ud83e\udd23 I am resigned to the fact that when they are teenagers I will have to keep all of my snacks somewhere else because they know all my current anti-teen hidey-holes.", "At the risk of sounding sexist, teenage boys do eat a lot but OP has a step daughter. Also OP is being confronted and accused of a-holism for suggesting he segregate his work food. Something's off and it feels like there's a compulsion involved.", "OP doesn\u2019t have a locker or office.", "Teenage girls can also eat a lot when they are growing.", "Definitely time for a divorce.", "Then keep it in the trunk of their vehicle until a more permanent solution can be achieved.", "NTA - I see many replies saying to get a mini fridge that locks. You can actually buy a lock box to put in your fridge, so you don't have to buy a separate appliance.", "But completely disregarding a heartfelt, reasonable request to not eat certain foods? It sounds like there are plenty of other foods in the house. It's confusing. It sounds like a compulsion to me. Or a deliberate act of hostility.", "They literally have no respect for him. They refuse to understand that he can only eat what he brings to work.", "Do you know how expensive divorce is?"]}
