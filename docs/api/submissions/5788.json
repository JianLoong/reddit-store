You see it as respect to not eat someone else's lunch, and other people (including the other people OP lives with whose opinions matter more in this scenario than ours) find it unthinkable to tag food as \"for me only\". No one is wrong, it's just a different approach to a shared fridge. And since OP has clearly made this request and been rebuffed, unless he wants to get divorced it would make sense to just buy more of all of these things to account for other people eating them. Is that necessarily \"right\"? No. But when you're part of a family sometimes you have to make concessions. As I said elsewhere, NTA for the request but there's other options here beyond \"keep demanding something that clearly no one else in the house agrees with and get nowhere\".", "You\u2019re absolutely not the asshole here! I work a combination of night/day shifts (12.5 hour shifts in healthcare), and when I\u2019m on nightshifts, I have a case of coke and a couple of red bulls in the house for me to pack for work. They don\u2019t sell them in the hospital and I need that red bull to drive home safely at the end of the shift. I\u2019d be furious if my husband drank them. Keep a stash of snacks in your car at least.", "So I don't disagree with you that you shouldn't \"have\" to check, but clearly you do at least to a certain degree. Some people grow up in households where it's fine for certain people to have certain foods just to themselves, and for others that's a complete foreign concept. Since your wife and stepkids are the latter, you both have to work together to find something that works for everyone. Can you just buy extra of everything to account for whatever might get eaten? I'm not sure how you split finances, but if you wife buys groceries for everyone then there's a shared pool for that at least. So use that shared pool to buy your work lunches and get some extras. If you buy 5 to get through the week, get ten or however many you think makes sense. You're NTA for your request, but it's clearly not being accepted so you work outward from there. Does that suck? Sure, but unless you want to divorce over it trying to change their minds is probably not useful.", "It's rude for them to eat your stuff when you've asked them not to, but I do think you've landed on the right solution, to just get more of that food. Could you just combine it with the household grocery shopping and double what you usually buy?", "Pretty sure the \"housemates\" are a wife and kid, so I assume not unless you're suggesting they get a divorce \ud83d\ude02", "Love the username", "We aren\u2019t food insecure, we have several hundred dollars of disposable income each month, not counting beer money and all the typical extravagances, this is purely a consideration thing. I\u2019ve adopted your approach and instead of buying only enough for the coming week I\u2019ve started to keep about two weeks worth on hand recently. Now I have to be mindful of expiration dates, small price to pay for peace in the house", "If it's the wife yelling at him for putting his food in a separate fridge, yes.", "Aww thanks! I'm sorry you're dealing with this.", "> small price to pay for peace in the house\n\nAbsolutely. Also for your peace of mind not needing to worry each morning. \n\nAs far as consideration goes, I would offer that \"consideration\" of things like this is very subjective. Clearly not in this thread, but reddit isn't the world. Neither the home I grew up in, my home with my partner now, or his childhood home ever had a \"tagged food for only me\" approach. I was an adult before I even hard that it was a thing and it's pretty difficult for me to wrap my head around when the option of \"buy more of that thing to account\" is there. I don't consider that inconsiderate, though I guess others do. But I would consider it inconsiderate if my partner bought a bunch of food taking up space in the fridge that I wasn't allowed to eat instead of just buying extras for me too. So, in short, my point here is I wouldn't necessarily take stock in all the comments telling you that you need couple's counseling or that your wife and stepkids seem \"horrible\" because of this one thing.", "Sorry, you think this man should get a divorce because he and his wife disagree about how food is dispersed in the house?", "Often, the small things are very revealing. They do say not to sweat the small stuff. BUT after taking care of his needs himself (not asking SO to cater to him or spend for him) and clearly communicating his needs to his family (treating them with respect in that way) they choose to dismiss these requests, then it is symptomatic of a unbalance of power. It is not healthy.", "Because they're depriving him of food during a 10 hour shift, won't allow him to make changes to protect his needs, and gaslights him about him taking and replacing food is the same as taking away the last of his food?\n\nYes.", "I don't think you know what gaslighting is, but okay great suggestion. Definitely something that people should consider. Divorce should always be the first option, rather than just buying more food and understanding that you're the only person in the house who thinks people should be able to earmark food for themselves so you might have to make a concession.", "People who don't realize that different situations may require different access to food resources, and call someone selfish for safeguarding their sole access to lunch, may not be reasonable or loving people.", "\"Gaslighting is a manipulative tactic in which a person, (...), plants seeds of uncertainty in another person's mind. The self-doubt and constant questioning slowly cause the individual to question their reality.\"\nThis kind of applies as he is storing his lunch in a separate fridge to ensure he can work and provide for THEM but thinks he may be the A/H. So yes...", "The issue is stbex wife and stepdaughter are entitled and lack empathy.", "No, it doesn't. I promise you that saying \"you're an asshole for wanting to earmark food for yourself or move it to a separate fridge so we can't eat it\", however inconsiderate it is, is not gaslighting. But proceed I guess."]}
