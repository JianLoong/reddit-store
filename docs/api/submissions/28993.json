After that, my step sister took me and my older sister (Vera, now 19f) in. My step sister (Ginny, 27f) was only 19 at the time and she gave us the best life she could at the time. She couldn\u2019t afford a babysitter so she would take us to work at the restaurant she worked at and her college classes. We all crammed into a studio apartment where she would sit in the bathroom into the early morning working on her homework or sewing up new clothes out of our worn out ones. I didn\u2019t realize until later that Ginny waited to eat dinner until after the two of us were done that it was to make sure Vera and I got enough to eat. I regret the nights when I had a second or third serving until the food was gone while Ginny went hungry for the night.\n\nThroughout all of this, Ginny never complained. She never made us feel guilty for disrupting her life or threatened to give us away. Vera and I were very thankless though until i realized everything she sacrificed for us with a smile on her face.\n\nGinny graduated college and got a career in IT and Vera and I got older and were able to take care of ourselves better.\n\nAnyways, the point I\u2019m trying to make is she sacrificed so much for Vera and I and I hadn\u2019t even realized it until I was writing my Common App essay last year.\n\nGinny\u2019s dream has always been to travel and see the world and now that I\u2019m moved out, she\u2019s been considering taking her saved up PTO and traveling. For her birthday, I saved up to give her $250 cash, a travel journal, and a nice backpack for her. I wish I could\u2019ve given her more.\n\nVera left early and had seemed off so I called her and asked what was up last week and she said that ir was unfair of me to thank and give this huge gift to just Ginny since Vera helped raise me too. But Vera just caused drama with Ginny. She was always picking fights, always saying Ginny wasn\u2019t her mom, when Ginny asked Vera to babysit me so Ginny could go to class, Vera would throw a tantrum. She constantly would criticize Ginny for not having enough. She always treats me like gum on the bottom of her shoe and did when we were younger too. She also didn\u2019t sacrifice 8 years of her life to raise me just so that we didn\u2019t have to go into the system. I didn\u2019t feel guilty about it until this, but it rubs me the wrong way. Ginny had tried to give the money back while Vera is demanding it.\n\nAita for not giving her a gift as well?", "created_utc": 1697408827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178qvua/aita_for_gifting_my_step_sister_250_and_giving/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thank you for realizing the sacrifices Ginny made for y\u2019all-most 19 years old would have walked away from such responsibilities. And she is your step sister which says a lot about her character. \n\nVera can bitch all she wants, but she is being shortsighted in regards to the hardships Ginny endured for the two of you. \n\nLife dealt the three of you a crappy  situation to deal with. Somehow y\u2019all manage to  survive & prosper. Ginny deserves your love, gratitude and the $250 with a backpack. Vera helped also, but begrudgingly. It\u2019s your money, you earned it so you decide who to give it to. \n\nI hope the rest of your life is a better one than you have dealt with so far. Good luck & blessings to the 3 of y\u2019all!", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your sister has an unrealistic view of her participation in \"raising\" someone just 1 year younger than her.  If she ends up holding it against you, try talking to her about the discrepancy you feel over a peace offering.  Maybe order her favorite foods, or better yet you could learn to make them; just show some token of appreciation just to show you still care about her even if you disagree with her personal take on the situation.", "NTA\n\nThis seems like a really thoughtful gift that isn\u2019t over the top. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never given your sister anything, you might make an effort, but in this situation you are definitely not an asshole.", ">Ginny had tried to give the money back while Vera is demanding it.\n\nNTA this answer is just here...

You get gifts because you're a decent human being; obviously your sister has some growing up to do.\n\nYour step-sister went above and beyond what was expected of her and she deserves your kind and generous gift.", "NTA, your step-sis is an amazing human being, she deserved that gift for everything she did. Your sister is the ah, she should be grateful to have someone like step sis that raised her,  istead of acting bratty and ungrateful.", "NTA even if she contributed to your upbringing, it was Ginny\u2019s bday and you wanted to gift  something meaningful.

Sounds like she taught one of you well!  Hopefully your sister will realize this too!", "Nta first it wasn't Vera's birthday, and secondly, Vera wasn't the one who gave up so much to take care of you.", "NTA.

But, rest assured you have done something wonderful and Ginny will appreciate it very, very much.", "NTA.

Your sister was/is an ungrateful immature brat.\n\nYou say that it was only when you wrote your Common App essay that you fully realised the sacrifices she made at the time, putting it down on paper brought the truth of it home to you. Clearly Vera hasn't done the same. Ask Vera if, being the same age now as Ginny at the time, she would be as willing to take on the raising of a 10 & 11 year old and the financial obligations that resulted. $250 is nothing compared with what Ginny spent on raising you both.\n\nVera needs a clear reality check. You saved the money and gifted it to Ginny. Vera is delusional, entitled and immature and has no right to make any demands of either you or Ginny. If/when Vera becomes a mother she might just realise exactly what Ginny sacrificed for her.......but probably not until then as she is too self absorbed at present.", "YTA for not slapping her when she said that stupid shit to you.", "I gave Ginny the gift at her birthday dinner. It was just me, Ginny, Ginny\u2019s bf, and Vera so I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal. I don\u2019t think Vera knows exactly how much I gave since Ginny tucked the cash away quickly.", "Sis is an AH.", "Yep. OP gave the gift to Ginny for HER BIRTHDAY and now sister is upset that she didn't get something as well? Sister is definitely TA.", "NTA OP, you have your priorities in order. What many fail to realize is that when giving a gift to one, you aren't depriving the other.", "Nta... write her a long thought-out letter similar to your post. It might give a different perspective.", "NTA. That was a gracious gesture to Ginny. I hope she thinks fondly of you whenever she uses that backpack.", "Nta. Step sis earned your admiration", "NTA what does Vera think an 11 yr old can do to raise a 10 yr old. Ginny at 19 raised not only you but Vera also. Vera didn't raise you Ginny did.", "Unless Vera has the same birthday as Ginny, she has no horse in this race! Why should she get a gift on someone else's birthday? Vera sounds kind of insufferable and I don't think you should be made to feel bad, and Ginny certainly should not be bullied into giving the money back to you, or to Vera. You are NTA here, and it sounds like Vera has some growing up to do.", "NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous.", "NTA. Gratitude is given, not demanded.  Vera has no say in how you disburse your gifts. Tell her to drop it and stop discussing it with her, because she has absolutely no right to direct your money. Keep your gifts and your finances private. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA", "Nta sad your bio sister is so selfish", "NTA. Try asking Vera how she raised you and how that would compare to how Ginny raised both of you... Try having her few entitled braincells work and maybe she'll realize something the same way you did.", "Nta", "NTA. I'm happy you had a Ginny. Vera obviously viewed things differeynt than you even though you're only a year apart but that's not your problem.", "NTA And Ginny is amazing. I hope she has fun traveling, she deserves it! You are a good sibling.", "NTA\n\nIt's Ginny's BIRTHDAY. Why would you give someone else a present on your stepsister's birthday??\n\nAlso, Vera did not sacrifice her 20's to raise you. She's not that much older than you, how could she ever RAISE you? I'm sure it was difficult growing up like that, but it can't have been much different for you than for her.  It feels like she has some anger or resentment about something, and it's coming out in this way.", "NTA. Your stepsister sounds like an amazing young woman. Your sister not so much.", "NTA, you say Ginny tried to give the money back, call her, and tell her exactly what you told us.  Tell her that you realize you were a brat, and that you can now see everything that she did for you and Vera.  That this isn't a lot, but it is what you could save to try and help her bring a dream true, and that if you could, you would make it so she could travel the world without trouble.    \n     \nThe gift is one thing, but you saying you see and understand everything Ginny went through to raise you and Vera, that is a gift you can give.  It is something Ginny needs to hear, and from what you say, Vera isn't going to.   \n    \nYou are not the AH here.  But there is an Angel in this story, and Ginny should know that you have seen it.  My god, I want to give Ginny a hug and tell her she did good, and that her parents would be so proud of her.", "NTA. Ginny stepped up to the plate. She took you guys in when she was just a kid herself. It sounds like Vera may have a different..view of how your guys raising/childhood was. I think Ginny actually earned the gift so to speak whereas Vera is entitled and honestly doesn't sound like a good sister (based on the scenario you've given it's my opinion not factual as I obviously don't know y'all) so no Ginny keep the money and travel! Vera, suck it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Beyond the fact that Ginny seems like a saint and Vera sounds delusional - IT\u2019S GINNY\u2019S BIRTHDAY. Why would Vera get a gift? \n\nYou are being extremely kind in saving that much for Ginny.

NTA dunno what you bio sisters problem is but she does NOT deserve the gift.", "NTA Ginny sounds like a Saint and Vera is entitled.", "INFO does Vera know Ginny went without food for you both? Does she acknowledge Ginny's sacrifice?", "It also seems like her sister doesn\u2019t understand what a birthday gift is. Like, imagine someone gets a birthday gift and you say \u201cyeah, we\u2019ll I want a present too, gimme it.\u201d Ma\u2019am, what?\n\nNTA, OP. It sounds like you and your sister have a very different understanding of the circumstances of your childhood, and based on her behavior in this instance and yours, I\u2019m going to say she\u2019s the one with a warped view. Sounds like she\u2019s been entitled your whole lives.", "NTA.  Why would you get Vera anything, it wasn't her birthday?  I don't understand why Vera thinks you should give her a gift."]}
