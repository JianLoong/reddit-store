After that, my step sister took me and my older sister (Vera, now 19f) in. My step sister (Ginny, 27f) was only 19 at the time and she gave us the best life she could at the time. She couldn\u2019t afford a babysitter so she would take us to work at the restaurant she worked at and her college classes. We all crammed into a studio apartment where she would sit in the bathroom into the early morning working on her homework or sewing up new clothes out of our worn out ones. I didn\u2019t realize until later that Ginny waited to eat dinner until after the two of us were done that it was to make sure Vera and I got enough to eat. I regret the nights when I had a second or third serving until the food was gone while Ginny went hungry for the night.\n\nThroughout all of this, Ginny never complained. She never made us feel guilty for disrupting her life or threatened to give us away. Vera and I were very thankless though until i realized everything she sacrificed for us with a smile on her face.\n\nGinny graduated college and got a career in IT and Vera and I got older and were able to take care of ourselves better.\n\nAnyways, the point I\u2019m trying to make is she sacrificed so much for Vera and I and I hadn\u2019t even realized it until I was writing my Common App essay last year.\n\nGinny\u2019s dream has always been to travel and see the world and now that I\u2019m moved out, she\u2019s been considering taking her saved up PTO and traveling. For her birthday, I saved up to give her $250 cash, a travel journal, and a nice backpack for her. I wish I could\u2019ve given her more.\n\nVera left early and had seemed off so I called her and asked what was up last week and she said that ir was unfair of me to thank and give this huge gift to just Ginny since Vera helped raise me too. But Vera just caused drama with Ginny. She was always picking fights, always saying Ginny wasn\u2019t her mom, when Ginny asked Vera to babysit me so Ginny could go to class, Vera would throw a tantrum. She constantly would criticize Ginny for not having enough. She always treats me like gum on the bottom of her shoe and did when we were younger too. She also didn\u2019t sacrifice 8 years of her life to raise me just so that we didn\u2019t have to go into the system. I didn\u2019t feel guilty about it until this, but it rubs me the wrong way. Ginny had tried to give the money back while Vera is demanding it.\n\nAita for not giving her a gift as well?", "created_utc": 1697408827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178qvua/aita_for_gifting_my_step_sister_250_and_giving/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thank you for realizing the sacrifices Ginny made for y\u2019all-most 19 years old would have walked away from such responsibilities. And she is your step sister which says a lot about her character. \n\nVera can bitch all she wants, but she is being shortsighted in regards to the hardships Ginny endured for the two of you. \n\nLife dealt the three of you a crappy  situation to deal with. Somehow y\u2019all manage to  survive & prosper. Ginny deserves your love, gratitude and the $250 with a backpack. Vera helped also, but begrudgingly. It\u2019s your money, you earned it so you decide who to give it to. \n\nI hope the rest of your life is a better one than you have dealt with so far. Good luck & blessings to the 3 of y\u2019all!", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your sister has an unrealistic view of her participation in \"raising\" someone just 1 year younger than her.  If she ends up holding it against you, try talking to her about the discrepancy you feel over a peace offering.  Maybe order her favorite foods, or better yet you could learn to make them; just show some token of appreciation just to show you still care about her even if you disagree with her personal take on the situation.", "NTA\n\nThis seems like a really thoughtful gift that isn\u2019t over the top. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never given your sister anything, you might make an effort, but in this situation you are definitely not an asshole.", ">Ginny had tried to give the money back while Vera is demanding it.\n\nNTA this answer is just here... You did a great things don't let your entilted brat of sister ruin", "Info: How does sis know what you gave Ginny?", "NTA  \n\nThe gifts you give are your choice.   \n\nI hope you told your sister what a shit she was growing up and  that's why she got nothing from you.  \n\nYou don't  get gifts because you exist.   You get gifts because you're a decent human being; obviously your sister has some growing up to do.\n\nYour step-sister went above and beyond what was expected of her and she deserves your kind and generous gift.", "NTA, your step-sis is an amazing human being, she deserved that gift for everything she did. Your sister is the ah, she should be grateful to have someone like step sis that raised her,  istead of acting bratty and ungrateful.", "NTA even if she contributed to your upbringing, it was Ginny\u2019s bday and you wanted to gift  something meaningful.  Your sister is though for feeling entitled on someone else\u2019s bday. Does she behave the same when her friends have birthdays and she doesn\u2019t get the \u201cvaluable\u201d gift?", "NTA I\u2019m so glad you had Ginny and that she treated you and Vera so well. On the other hand, Vera is a very entitled, selfish woman.", "NTA. That is amazing that she did this for you both!!  You are very wise to see stepsister's sacrifice & do something so kind!!  Sounds like she taught one of you well!  Hopefully your sister will realize this too!", "Nta first it wasn't Vera's birthday, and secondly, Vera wasn't the one who gave up so much to take care of you.", "NTA. I'm so glad you recognised what Ginny did for you and have found a way to reciprocate. Vera sounds a bit entitled so unfortunately won't see your point of view. But, rest assured you have done something wonderful and Ginny will appreciate it very, very much.", "NTA.  Sounds like Vera needs the come to Jesus moment you had upon realizing how much your stepsister had done for you.  Tell Ginny to keep the money.  Tell Vera to travel herself and take a hike.", "NTA.

Your sister was/is an ungrateful immature brat.\n\nYou say that it was only when you wrote your Common App essay that you fully realised the sacrifices she made at the time, putting it down on paper brought the truth of it home to you. Clearly Vera hasn't done the same. Ask Vera if, being the same age now as Ginny at the time, she would be as willing to take on the raising of a 10 & 11 year old and the financial obligations that resulted. $250 is nothing compared with what Ginny spent on raising you both.\n\nVera needs a clear reality check. You saved the money and gifted it to Ginny. Vera is delusional, entitled and immature and has no right to make any demands of either you or Ginny. If/when Vera becomes a mother she might just realise exactly what Ginny sacrificed for her.......but probably not until then as she is too self absorbed at present.", "YTA for not slapping her when she said that stupid shit to you.", "I gave Ginny the gift at her birthday dinner.
