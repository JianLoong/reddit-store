My husband is not an introvert and I still would not make him visit my mother every week lol.  Surely there\u2019s a compromise.", "NAH, you both have different socialization comfort levels. Could you try dinner a different day? Maybe it's the stress of the upcoming week that is making it unpleasant.\n\nI also suspect things will change after the baby comes. Maybe not at first because they sleep a lot, but kids take up a lot of your free time. You may well welcome going to the inlaws so they dote on the kids and you get to relax.", "NTA - as a fellow introvert I understand the need for alone time.  You need to explain to your wife that there times on Sunday when you just need to stay home and decompress.  You are not trying to stop her from seeing her family, you are simply trying to be you.", "NTA at all sometimes it\u2019s hard for social to understand how important non-social time is for an introvert. If I were you I would talk to your spouse about it and decide together how much you should go and not go to the in-laws and how to politely explain why. Also just bc you don\u2019t go doesn\u2019t mean your spouse (and future kid) don\u2019t go. Good luck!", "NAH. \n\nMaybe limit to just dinner and only occasionally do a movie. Or, maybe your wife goes solo most Sundays with the eventual first kid.\n\nWith MIL having cancer - let your wife spend as much time as she can with her mother and I\u2019d argue you do need to participate occasionally.", "NTA, you could always go on dinner on week days ya know", "NTA\n\nThe fact that you don't want to stop going over entirely means you aren't being selfish because you said \"for me to **occasionally** say I don't want to go\", which implies that you would still go most of the time. Plus, while you MIL might not fully understand your wife should if she knows you as a person. Maybe talk to your wife and agree to some type of routine for when you go or not go?", "NTA, you need to have a talk with your wife about your feelings.", "NTA.

I love her to pieces, and we have our only grandchild (13yo). My FIL passed away in 2018, so she is alone, but has a good, solid support system, with her friends. We have a small family, my husband, son, my bro in law, and me. It's been 5 years, of dinners, every weekend, unless she has something come up. It's exhausting.", "NTA-  I think you need to talk to your wife and let her know this is exhausting for you.  You can compromise and say you will go once a month and she can go without you and tell everyone hi for me.  My husband and I been married for over 32 years.  Both of us sometimes don\u2019t go to in-laws when we don\u2019t feel like it or exhausted.  In-Laws should understand that.  When we get home the in-laws will say tell her or him we missed them and prepare a plate of food for us to take home to the spouse.", "NTA but you\u2019re right that you\u2019re not going to have much time to yourself when you have a baby. \n\nTalk to your wife and maybe you can compromise and she can go to MIL\u2019s house every weekend and you just join her sometimes.", "INFO:\n\nI don't think you would be an AH for suggesting to your wife she could go alone occasionally, but how you say it could make a difference as to whether you come across as an AH. So a few questions...\n\nIf you weren't at your in-laws for dinner and TV viewing, what would you be doing? Eating dinner and...what??\n\nYou've said your MIL is very sociable, but she's now recovering from bowel cancer. So does this mean she isn't as sociable as usual, are these evening family times are the main time she sees others right now?\n\nWhen you say they are 5 minutes away, is this 5 minutes drive or 5 minutes walk? Would it be feasible for you to return separately? You after the meal, her later in the evening to give you time to do something else?", "NTA Maybe there\u2019s a compromise to be had. Can you suggest you go on Saturdays instead of Sundays for the reasons you explained. And maybe skip one in every three. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unreasonable request to have time for yourself. Your wife can still go. Good luck!", "NAH. People have different family dynamics.  Talk to your wife and find a compromise.  Maybe skipping a weekend here and there.", "NTA.  Nobody can be an asshole because of their feelings.  An action is required.  Anyone who doesn't want to participate in a social activity has the right to make the choice without interference or judgement.  The reality is that everyone will judge and try to influence your decision.  When you don't want to go \"I have a headache.\" is a reason that everyone understands.  \"I don't feel well and am going to lie down\" is another.  Otherwise never engage in a conversation about why you don't want to go.  It will descend into an argument, guilt tripping, and name calling.  If the white lie offends your sensibilities just say \"I don't feel like it\" and remain silent in the face of being assailed by someone.  My thoughts.  You are the decider.  Choose to be happier.", "NTA. Just explain to your wife and her family that you would prefer not to spend every Sunday with them. I'm sure once a month would be fine", "NTA just acknowledge that as an introvert, this is not great for you every Sunday. Do every other one", "NTA. If you could go every other week or once a month, that would be enough. And it would allow you to let yourself off the hook, that might be the most important thing.", "NTA but you need to actually discuss it. You're going to end up resenting your wife when in reality she may have no idea this is how you feel. There are lots of ways to compromise on this: do every other Sunday instead of every week, your wife can go herself some weeks and go together others, she can arrange a weekday meet up the 2 of them some weeks too.", "Your NTA\n\nI'm an extrovert that needs alone time. I get stressed out from having people around me all the time. I love people, but I need to hang out with just me too. \nMy partner tried to give me about two evenings per week where he goes to play games in the office or over at friends and I get to hang out just by myself. \n\nI too felt really bad about needing time for just me, but I explained that I need it to decompress and that otherwise my brain gets stressed out. Explaining this to him actually was great for our relationship. I'm a lot less snappy and happier having time to myself.\n\nWe've got two small children. 2,5 years and 3 months. The 3 month old doesn't count for me, because all he requires is for me to be there. I don't need to interact or play with Duplo or anything. I can just sit and hold him and relax. The 2,5 year old has an early bedtime (7pm) because that's our cultural norm. So she's usually asleep by eight, giving us a few hours without a toddler running around. I'm sure you'll find a way that works for you when your child arrives. For now, talk to your wife and explain your needs.", ">and potentially impacting her time with her mom due to my selfishness\n\nWhy can't she just go by herself half the time", "NTA.\n\nTell her to go  and have a good time. Smile.\n\nSuggest that a Friday or Saturday dinner would be better and let wife know that you are good for only one or two of those evenings a month. If her parents ask you directly, tell them you need your weekends to unwind and prepare for the next work week and you can only do so much socializing without it impacting you.  You don't owe anyone a reason, but if they are the understanding type they will accept this. \n\nIf not, just don't go and if asked say I don't feel up to it tonight.", "NTA \nI\u2019m close to my family.  My husband is an introvert.  If he doesn\u2019t want to hang with my family, I go alone.  It\u2019s not a big deal.   \nFamily made jokes at first \u201cah, guess we are too much\u201d. But now they don\u2019t care and just send me home with half a plate of cookies for him. (It may be a full plate when I leave. But somehow it\u2019s never a full plate when I get home)", "NTA. Maybe you can compromise with your SO. They can go if they want. But you will only go once a month. Twice if you feel like it.", "NTA. My husband is in this exact situation. My parents want weekly visits and he is an introvert who also doesn't really enjoy their company (differing politics plus my dad is kind of a jerk to my husband and always has been, but then says he is \"joking.\") \n\nI go and see my parents every week because my mom has health issues and needs a lot of help. My husband comes once every couple of months and to special occasions with my full support. Work with your wife on plausible excuses.  You should be on the same team. We often use \"He has a big week at work and needs time to prepare.\"  My parents don't need to know that preparing means relaxing around the house before the stress of the week begins.", "NAH\n\nI don't think anyone here is an AH, just different people with different feelings on how much family time they need.\n\nI don't have any of my family around any more, but I was very close to my mum and expect that if she were still here, that I'd want to see her pretty often (maybe not every week, but possibly) and she wasnt a drain on my social battery, so it wouldnt impact me thay way, so I get your wife's POV. \n\nOn the other hand, my partner's parents aren't far away, and I absolutely would not want to spend every Sunday afternoon with them, because much as I like them and they are lovely, they aren't people I can feel rested and recharged around, they are draining to me and, like you, my weekends are about recharging and relaxing.\n\nThere is nothing wrong, in my eyes, with you wanting to skip it every now and then and let your wife go alone. Obviously you would need to talk to your wife and explain it carefully, so she doesn't take it the wrong way, but there should be a compromise available here.", "I wouldn't consider myself an introvert, but this sounds too much, especially on a Sunday.  You're certainly NTA but you will have to speak with your wife and tell her that you can't make every Sunday, perhaps just go once a month ?", "Take 2 cars. Go for dinner, then politely excuse yourself. Lethe the wife and kids stay.  Family dinner is important, IMHO. It will be 90 minutes out of your day. And it's only half the year.", "Could you work out a compromise with your wife that you will go to dinner every other / every third sunday and she can go to all of them if she so wishes at least until the baby is here?\nAfter the baby is born and you have settled in a routine you and your wife can revisit the conversation about dinner with you in laws and how often would suit your new family", "Since I read in the comments that you're also constantly complaining about this, yes, YTA. Put your big boy panties on and have an actual heart-to-heart with your wife and explain your feelings and see if you could start going every other week or monthly or something. Promise not to complain about this ever again and she'll probably be much more open to compromise. Good luck.", "Your NTA as a fellow introvert, family time is stressful, added onto starting work the next day it is totally reasonable to have some sundays in.\n\nYTA for not communicating to your wife properly and giving her chance to support you. Last thing she wants is (a likely) sulking husband whilst she gets time with mom. \n\nCommunicate with your wife and agree to something like once a month or every other week (compromise) you get to be Mr Introvert.  \n\nWith a child on the way, prepare for it to get harder, best to figure this out now.", "YTA to yourself.

Dishonesty seems a pretty harsh word.  I prefer deflecting which is a behavior that is endorsed by centuries of custom.
