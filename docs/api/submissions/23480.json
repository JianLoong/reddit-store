I say this as my wife is doing a family gathering with her side of the family while I was working on some projects at home today myself. I go to Christmas and see everyone - that's when they get me. Anything else depends on if I'm feeling it.   \n\n\nThe big thing is communicating with your significant other and just making them aware of what you want to do and getting them on board with it. You don't want to just surprise them with this but let them know it's something you have been talking about for awhile. Sometimes focusing on family is just that - the want to focus on your direct family within the household.", "NAH you and your wife are not joined at the hip.  There is no reason why the wife can't just go see them herself.  Maybe go once every couple of months.", "NTA, not you're a grown ass man. Tell your wife you want to stay home and play video games with your friends.", "[removed]", "We moved from Texas to Colorado when I was 24 and left my parents and in-laws behind. Saw them once a year (ish) for a long time. They've all passed on now, including my husband. I was jealous of friends and other family members who had Sunday dinners. But, I never thought once a week was a good idea! Too much is too much!\n\nI'd go with something like \"we'll be there every third Sunday.\" And someday, y'all host them on the first Sunday. Or whatever. Change up the routine, and see if that helps.\n\nI would have been a bitch on wheels if I saw my in-laws once a week. May they rest in peace. \u270c\ufe0f", "This is a good point. We see them so much that I forget there\u2019s a logical reason I don\u2019t necessarily feel comfortable and relaxed with them. They\u2019re my in-laws, not my parents.", "Yeah she knows what\u2019s up, all too well. We had a good talk about it today and I am just going to be more decisive. People on this thread have helped a lot.", "Lol. More like take a bubble bath and read.", "Thank you.", "I can honestly say it\u2019s not like that at all.", "I always go. Having an \u201cexcuse\u201d not to go that was the result of my complaining would just make me feel worse. There\u2019s no way I would ever be like \u201coh cool, looks like I don\u2019t have to go then!\u201d", "well, that's what's what you currently do, but then you make your wife miserable about it.", "Then how is it?  Your internal struggles are for *you* to resolve.  Why are you making it *her* problem?", "This is accurate. I recognize that this needs to change.", "Not saying my attitude is right. It\u2019s just not what the commenter assumed.", "NTA.  I have Sunday dinners with my in laws every weekend, however, there are boundaries regarding this.  Dinner is just an hour that\u2019s it.  Not all evening.  Also, if we need to skip a dinner there are no hard feelings.  Your wife needs to work with you to find a compromise.  Family time is good but it\u2019s not good when it monopolizes the whole evening every week.", "nta. i have friends who have a similar dynamic to what you described and her husband goes maybe 1-2x/month.", "Nta every week is excessive. I would only expect my spouse to show up to one of those a month at the most.", "NTA You can't have needs met if you don't express them. I've often attended my family events without spouse in tow and vise versa.", "Nah mate. That is unreasonable in my estimation.", "NTA go 1x a month instead", "NTA, but you gotta communicate better. Explain to your wife that you do not want to go spend 5+ hours of every weekend / almost every weekend with HER family. \n\n\n\nI\u2019d also start these conversations now and set boundaries now unless you want to practically live over there when she cancer guilts your wife into doing what she wants always.", "NTA and discuss with your wife to go just once or twice a month. At the most.", "NTA I wouldn't want to visit my own mom once a week. Also, If I did, I would expect some things my (non existent) SO wouldn't care about to be talked over. Not only are there personal details of her health and your wife's pregnancy in your case, but hell, there are things my mom talks about **I** don't care about. I ain't putting that on someone else. Better to have someone help me recover afterwards.  \nBasically you don't need to go on a double date with your wife and ILs every Sunday night. There are not 6 months of movies I'd even want to watch. Yeech. Watching someone else's idea of good entertainment all the time.", "NTA.  People who work full-time deserve to have the weekends to relax.\n\nGo for dinner and don\u2019t stay for the movie, since you are 5 minutes away.  Or ho every other week.", "I am also an introvert and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad for not wanting to do something that makes you uncomfortable or something you just don\u2019t want to do it\u2019s ok to think about your mental and physical health too", "Agree OP has soooo many alternatives to attending *every* Sunday from 5 to 9. Don't go every week, but rather go every other week, or monthly, or whatever frequency. Go for dinner but don't stay for Netflix. Don't attend dinner but join for Netflix (bonus points for this one since almost zero human interaction is required). OP could host sometimes, so they can participate for part of the evening but retreat to their own space and prep for Monday or whatever while wife continues to visit with her mom. \n\nAnd yes, MIL's cancer status does warrant making an extra effort to find a solution that works for everyone. Presumably, she is either in remission or will be going through chemotherapy. She is not cured.", "She\u2019s not like that. My MIL is cool.", "They mostly talk about what shows they\u2019re watching that I\u2019m not lol. It\u2019s super fun.", "I try to keep my ho\u2019ing to twice a month.", "Uhhh huh\u2026. Gotta say I\u2019m so thrilled that the point of that comment went right over your head. Grow up and communicate.", "Please tell me they don't watch reality TV. MIL and wife talking about Big Brother or the Bachelor? They wouldn't want me there because I'd bust out swearing like a sailor if I tried to hold that in more than once. Hey! Get yourself kicked out! There's an option if you just can't say no! JK. Seriously. Make it every two weeks tops. See how it goes from there.", "I laughed at this because my spouse and I went to my parents for supper every Sunday. Stayed about 5 hours each time lol. And my parents stopped by during the week to see the kids extra. \n\nNow that my kids are older I see them for supper every Sunday and during the week once or twice. There are 14 of us!\n\nI know it's not for everyone... I just laughed at us doing it too. \ud83e\udd23", "You accused someone of \u201ccancer guilting.\u201d Perhaps learn a little tact. And compassion.", "I\u2019d probably enjoy it more if it was reality TV, but alas it\u2019s real shows with \u201cstories.\u201d Thank you for the advice. Edit: I know that sounds pretentious as fuck, I\u2019m just not into shows like my wife is.", "Growing up, that was my family.  There would be at least 20.\n\nBut this is not something OP wants so time for an adjustment.", "No!! The \"grown up\" thing to do would be to say, \"Honey, I'm a bit socialed out. How would you feel if I stayed home every other Sunday?\"", "You know what? \n\nYou deserve the misery you live in.", "[removed]", "Dude, the only shows I watch are on rerun channels. We like what we like.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. Sometimes that feels like a selfish solution since it involves me getting what I want. But I get that everyone will be happier in the long run if I\u2019m not being a complaining baby.", "I started this account yesterday.", "You literally posted in r/relationshipadvice twice two days ago. And then wussed out about it and deleted the posts. You\u2019re a terrible liar.", "You\u2019re right. It was two days ago. I forgot I had started and tried to delete a post. I tried to delete it because I was upset and it was ludicrous.", "NTA, not at all. Just speak to your wife. My husband is similar to you and therefore I just go and visit my family (or friends) alone. He needs his quite time, I love to talk for hours or go shopping. Many people think that as soon as you are married you need spend every moment with each other but the truth is couple are different. While my husband and I love to spend time together we also love to spend time separately. Just talk to your wife. She might be actually released since she knows that you don't enjoy those evenings. Or at least she will be relieved when she sees that you are happier that way. But talk openly to your parents in law about your reasons. Just tell them that you are overstimulated. Don't make your wife make up excuses for you", "NTA\n\nAs an introvert with social anxiety I understand. I stopped visiting my brother a long time ago because I couldn't handle having to socialize for hours. He complains that I don't come around anymore but idc my mental health is more important than his happiness.\n\nNo one understands how you feel but you so fuck what everyone else thinks/says.", "NTA.. you need to find a balance that works for you both", "NTA, every guy needs some time away from the old ball and chain the the mil", "NTA send her alone.
