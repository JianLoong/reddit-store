In his other comments, he said his wife did something \"disgusting\" to his mom before that he can't explain due to the sub's rules, so it's possible she assaulted her or something.

And Emily is just as manipulative as your mom. Wtf was she thinking. No healthy person would do this revenge. No wonder your Mom and Emily are best buds. They are similar ppl and enable each other.

Why in the fuck are you not cutting contact?\n\nI'd suggest you visit the sub r/raisedbynarcissists", ">Oh so you know everything going on lmao\n\nNah, we don't, because your wife did some \"disgusting\" (your words not mine) shit to your mom and you won't tell us. \ud83d\udc80 Love how you think it's funny though.", "Sometimes people just bond. My boyfriend's ex wife and his mom remained great friends. And then his mom also became friends with me.

OP did say his wife did something to his mom that is so dreadful that he can\u2019t detail in this sub because it\u2019s something not allowed in this sub.

Check his comments. Elsewhere he says his wife did something \"disgusting\" to his mother that he can't even mention per the sub's rules and he doesn't blame her for not wanting contact with his wife. Like, it almost sounds like assault. His ex's husband or something said he'd be disgusted with him if he didn't divorce his wife over it, but he refuses to say what his wife did. The ex's husband thinks they're abusive to his mom. \n\nThe red flag for me was when he felt the need to scurry home real quick and tell his wife a dumb comment his mentally ill mother made because of a \"strict no secrets policy.\" I would've laughed if my significant other's mom had said this. Not cuss her out.", "The therapist knows a lot more about the situation than you.", "Op is leaving a lot of things out of the story.\n\nThe therapist sided with his mom for a reason.\n\nHe apparently cheated on Emily with his current partner and the current partner did something awful to the mom that he doesn\u2019t want to specify.

I'm not saying if Emily backed off that would magically repair the relationship between OP's current wife and the woman, but like promising to give your ex's mother spiritual grandchildren???\n\nThere is a level of enmeshment here that feels emotionally cruel. At some point, OP's mother is going to regret never getting to know their bio-grandkids all because they're attached to the fantasy of Emily as the perfect DIL but by then it'll have been too late.", "The hell if she didn\u2019t. \n\nETA: corrected tense", "And having your x DI over so she can try on your wedding gown and letting your son know the ex is promising you grandchildren isn't manipulative drama queen bullshit?", "Dude, I realize she's your mother but she's not putting *her relationship with you* in perspective.\n\nShe's refusing to be a grandmother, she's not even attempting to look past her issues with your wife (independent of the great crime of being \"Not Emily\") for the sake of the love you feel for her, and she's actively future farming a maternal relationship with Emily as some kind of replacement daughter.\n\nI don't want to be brusque but whilst you love her, she's not actively interested in investing in a relationship with you as a parent, and that's really disheartening.", "Trust me, the moment Emily gets pregnant, she is not gonna care about your mother beyond her ability to be a source of free labour and gifts.", "I think there's a way to handle it. For instance, using my example... My boyfriend's mom maintained her positive relationship with her ex daughter in law after they split up. My boyfriend didn't really care because they kept it to themselves. \n\nThen when he and I started dating his mom and I got along like gangbusters. She basically adopted me. I loved her, too. \n\nAt some point I started intersecting with his ex and, frankly, I liked her. But I knew he wasn't really comfortable with it so I limited that contact. He was ok if sometimes I did stuff with his mom and ex when it was very occasional.  \n\nI couldn't bring myself to outright avoid her once his mom was actively dying of cancer and both myself and his ex were caring for her. And he was cool about it.\n\nHis mom passed a year and a half ago and I haven't been in contact with his ex since. I did like her. She seemed like my kind of gal. But I get it. I wish her well.", "If you read OP's comments, there was a lot left out here. OP is VLC and mother is NC with the wife. It honestly sounds like the mother doesn't want to be around his abusive wife or their spawn.

It's totally not weird or abusive.", "Not really sure, didn't see the comment about being on a break before I posted.
