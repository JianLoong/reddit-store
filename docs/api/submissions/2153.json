She sees that I've almost cut my mom off and knows I've gone through absolute hell. She would never ask me to go full no contact. She also owns her role in this and admits she has been out of line with my mom multiple times. Also at the very least she is aware I was dropping off money so we don't get sued which is kind of a priority", "This shouldn\u2019t be said regarding one\u2019s mother, but I don\u2019t think she loves you enough. What kind of mother picks an unrelated woman over her own child? What kind of mother attacks her own son\u2019s masculinity?\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not forcing your wife to interact with her, but you may be doing a disservice to yourself by continuing to seek out your mother. She gave birth to you, but she can\u2019t be the mother you need, and frankly, deserve.", "My mom hasn't spoken with her egg donor in over a decade and it's done wonders for her mental health. Did she love her mom? Yes, but loving someone doesn't mean willingly letting them abuse you over and over again. Is it difficult? Absolutely. And sometimes the most difficult things you have to do are the ones most worth doing.", "You can love your mom, and still decide to cut contact with her for your own mental wellbeing. She has made it clear that you mean less to her than your ex, and honestly she is allowed to choose her family, but you are also allowed to cut out a toxic person in your life. What will your child say, growing up seeing grandma hurting mom and dad, calling them all sorts of names etc? \n\nIt sounds like your mom has a lot she needs to work on, and it sounds like it has taken her a very long time to get to that realisation.\n\nThat said, some times, we need to cut the rope to save ourselves, and eventhough we love someone, being around them causes more hurt than good.", "This is a trickle truth. The OP\u2019s comments say that he broke up with Emily because he cheated on her (but she revenge cheated, so it\u2019s okay!) and that Madison isn\u2019t very nice to his mom. And also when they did family therapy, OP was the \u201cbad guy\u201d and his family is treating him like he\u2019s an abuser as a result. \n\n\nThis sounds like OP\u2019s mom definitely needs therapy, but this is a one-off event in a long series of wtf that finally paints mom in a worse light than OP.", "It helps your mental health to be called a pussy by your mother?", "If my mother didn\u2019t want to meet my child, I would have to cut her out of my life. It\u2019s tough but she is basically making the decision for you.", "So you spend time with somebody who hates your future child? Imagine how they will feel as they grow up. \"Oh, your daddy is just going to see the woman who wishes you never existed.\" Why would you do that to your family?", "Dude why do you want this woman in your life.\nShe legit admitted to choosing your ex over you.\n\nShe won\u2019t even see your child. Why would you want to keep contact with a woman that despises your child?\n\nLike come on man, think about your kid. You really want your kid growing up knowing grandma hates him because they weren\u2019t birthed by an ex.\n\nYTA for not thing about the kid", "So use a bank transfer instead. Cut a cheque and post it. Send a postal order. You don't have to go over there at all, you're choosing to.\n\nPS... calling you a \"pussy\" and not a real man is her abusing you too, not just your wife.", "Info:\n\nWhy would you get sued for something your wife did to your mom? This does not add up, OP.", "And there are a lot of people who mean more to me than her. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have lunch once or twice a year if it makes me feel better", "Absolutely!", "My wife did something to my mother that I can't really say because sub rules but my mom chose to cut contact at least temporarily. My mom isn't stupid. She knows no relationship with the mom means she can't see the baby", "Time? A few hours a year and why would I announce that to my kid. My wife would never want me to not grab lunch once or twice a year if it makes me feel better", "For the amount of money we owe her husband though if my mom really wanted to be petty maybe she could have called the cops", "OP, everyone here is piling on your mom - why did you omit this vital piece of information? Your wife doesn't sound very nice either. Edit your post to add this.", "I just struggle to reconcile that you feel better spending time with somebody emotionally abusive. Somebody who has disowned your child. I mean, I guess you have your needs, but I find it hard to understand. You need therapy. Partly, because the destruction of that familial relationship, no matter whose fault is hard. I don't blame the wife for not wanting you to make that choice, I judge you for not making that choice for yourself.", "So what are you going to tell your child about Grandma? That she only wants to see me, son, and not you or your mother? How do you think that will make him feel? And don't think he won't notice how your mother treats him or won't ask why she ignores him. This will effect your relationship with your child.\n\nThe therapist was right, your mom can be friends with Emily. She can even choose her over you if she wants. But you do not have to stand there and take her abuse because she is your mother. You can love her and realize that she is not good for your mental health or your growing family. Right now, your mother has the best of both worlds- she has Emily and she has you seeking any scrap of attention from her, even to the detriment of your own family. This will come back to bite you in the butt as you will have to explain to your child why you are happy to continue to see a woman who hates him.\n\nWhat are you going to tell your child, OP?", "What my wife did in that situation was disgusting and I support my mom cutting contact but it really doesn\u2019t excuse her obsession with Emily", "I don\u2019t see why I\u2019d have to tell him anything. I only met one out of four grandparents and never questioned why. My mom is never going to see him so she can\u2019t treat him any way. I\u2019m talking about having lunch once or twice a year. There is no reason for my kid to even question that"]}
