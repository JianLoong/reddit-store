If a coworker is making you feel uncomfortable with his curiosity about your personal life, dating habits, marriage plans, and/or anything else not pertaining to your work position, you should report him to HR.", "NTA. OP, when he asked about your caste status it sounds like a red flag to me. The red flag I am referring to is potential grounds for discrimination. Next time he asks again, the best thing you do is tell him that it is none of his business and what he is doing is not okay. If he keeps at it repeatedly, you know what to do just report him.

This guy is way out of line and has said some racist stuff to you. He's also been too familiar and culturally insensitive.  You have every right to go to HR if you want to.  \n\nI don't know the kind of work situation you're in though, so be a little careful? In an ideal world you'd talk to HR and they'd talk to this person and maybe give him some training that better explains boundaries to him and he'd go on his way. Perhaps even better y'all would get some kind of cultural sensitivity training that would help illustrate the many not ok things he said without him feeling personally called out.  But I mean I've seen theses situations go in less than ideal directions.  \n\nMy personal thoughts are DEFINITELY report if it's still an issue or if he becomes a problem again.  If you think the limiting interaction with him is enough to keep yourself safe, figure out what the \"worst case response\" would be, how likely that is, and whether you still want to talk to HR.", "Good heavens!\n\nRacist and creepy too.\n\nYWNBTA if you reported him, that was grossly inappropriate. You would also not be TA if didn't report him, on the grounds that you think it's probably more trouble than it's likely worth, and you're not really interacting with him anymore.\n\nAnd just in case anyone is confused, while forced marriages are illegal here (and should be everywhere) an arranged marriage that is voluntarily entered into by consenting adults isn't, and isn't anyone's business beyond the concerned parties.", "Nta he sounds racist.  Not in your face, brown people are animals racist but the 'fairier people are high caste' and 'arranged marriages are illegal here' (which they aren't, forced marriages yes but not arranged)  are just inappropriate to ask a co worker.", "NTA, I have worked in HR and would definitely want to know about this behavior and put a stop to it, because it is completely inappropriate and could get the company sued.", "NTA this should be reported.
