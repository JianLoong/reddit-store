What if there were children in the picture too? I think a break or marriage counseling or something would help a lot. Can you go stay with your parents for a month?", "NTA. So the pets primarily belong to him and now that you are taking care of them he doesn't want to keep up with his basic responsibilities.

What kind of behavior did you expect from a 20 year old kid? He's not going to take care of his own pets, do you think he'd take care of kids? What if you were sick, would he take care of you?
