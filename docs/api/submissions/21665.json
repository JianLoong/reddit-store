It is very kind of you to be willing to put even 50/50 into pets that are not yours. I would be seeing this as a major red flag. The pets are his, so their care is his responsibility. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.  Unless you are attached to them the pets should be rehomed because a tortoise and a parrot are life-long pets and he should be taking care of them more.  Parrots are especially a \"love 'em or leave 'em\" animal because they require a lot of a care and can be temperamental.  My sister's ex-husband loved his parrot - her, not so much.  I don't know anything about tortoises except they live long and are not fuzzy.", "NTA", "NTA. These were never HIS pets, they were his parents\u2019. It sounds like he has never looked after them a day in their lives. Send them back to live with his parents.", "I need to know what kind of intense schedule a parrot and tortoise need that makes toilet breaks difficult? I think I must be missing something.", "So what did he do before you guys were together? He dealt with them then, he can deal with them now. 100% NTA, good for you OP.", "The husband would totally tell people he babysits his own kids. You are NTA", "NTA. These are supposed to be HIS pets, not yours. It's wonderful that pets from his childhood care about you so much and have formed a bond with you. But it sounds like he no longer wishes to have these pets based on how he has dumped all responsibilities onto you to care for and feed them. I think you two need to sit down together and talk this out, explain how his actions are affecting you, and that he needs to step up to care for his animals, or worst case scenario: talk about rehoming them if he refuses to put any effort into helping you.", "Nta\n\nThey're his pets, he should be doing 100% of care.\n\nChoose to stop being used.  He needs to step up on household chores too.", "NTA\n\nAnd I would strongly suggest you to reconsider how much more time you are willing to put into this guy. Stress can build up in your body without you noticing because you\u2019re always taking care of everything. If you don\u2019t take a breather, which would be the case if you didn\u2019t have a grown up baby at home, eventually that will cause you to burn out and that\u2019s dangerous for your well-being and health in general!

They aren't children.", "He\u2019s a deadbeat pet dad", "And these pets have a long ass life span", "Aren\u2019t parrots also totally capable of grudges and spite and could hate him for being negligent or any other bird reason?", "I'm so sorry. I know that's hard for everyone but him.", "Maybe he had a meltdown because he actually had to take some responsibility at home one day of his life? And where the hell does he go till midnight every Tuesday? This guy is a walking red flag.", "I think that\u2019s literally what he\u2019s doing. Fucking someone else, that is.", "Pet owners are weird. Especially the ones that treat these animals as \"family\". They deserve everything that they've asked for here.", "!00% And I'm a selfish man. You have to train him like the pets and put him on a schedule the same way. He will get away with whatever you let hm get away with.\n\nHere's the plan: You tell him, though you work from home you are still working and as such you 2 should be splitting the chores equally. But to show him what you go through in a week. For the next week he is going to do all of the chores you do, and you will be doing the chores he does. And stick to it. If he doesn't get something done don't do it unless it affects you (your laundry, your meals , your grocery shopping) And let his stuff go on the wayside. \n\nIf he doesn't get it by then or doesn't do it, then you just take care of yourself and regrettably the pets. He can take care of his laundry, cooking, shopping, etc. He didn't marry a mom with benefits! He needs to man up! \n\nNTA", "It\u2019s Nietzsche\u2019s superman who is superior and able to transcend Christian morality/God in favor of his own rules, someone who always rises from the ashes. A Napoleon, Da Vinci, Julius Caesar type, which is obviously the only way someone could balance a pet and an interview", "Maybe that's also a colloquial name for a turtle local to your area, but leatherbacks are the largest sea turtle species. They are pelagic and don't spend a lot of time near shore although they do use the beach for nesting. I really really hope they aren't wandering over roads where you live.", "I\u2019ve met one adult parrot person and they were, and I\u2019m being generous here, eccentric.

I guess it does go with the video games, and they're 2 decades younger than I am.\nStill sounds exhausting though.", "If OP is lucky, that's what he's doing.", "Day to day stuff with turtles is easy. But turtles are smelly animals, and cleaning their tanks and changing their water is labor intensive.
