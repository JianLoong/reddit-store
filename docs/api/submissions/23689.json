My husband has a decent job, but we still live paycheck to paycheck. I haven\u2019t worked since having my daughter, but I recently got an offer to work as a receptionist at a hotel by our house. The only problem is finding a daycare for my daughter. \n\nMy daughter is special needs, and one of her needs is a wheelchair accessible daycare. The only daycare that my husband and I have found suitable for our daughter is too expensive for us right now. We agreed to ask my sister (28F) and her wife for help paying for the daycare we found. I knew it was a risk because my sister has been planning on doing another round of IVF, which is expensive, but my sister and her wife both have great careers. They make triple of what my husband makes a year, and I could pay them back once I start working and saving.\n\nWhen I asked my sister and her wife they were hesitant. My sister kept asking why we couldn\u2019t find a cheaper daycare, but she doesn\u2019t understand that not all daycares work with special needs and the one we found does. I told my sister that I would pay her back over time, and I just need her help for the first three months of daycare. My sister said that they can\u2019t afford to help us right now fund my daughter\u2019s daycare, but I know that\u2019s a lie, and she just doesn\u2019t want to. I told my sister that she was being selfish, and her niece is special needs so she can\u2019t just go to a cheap daycare. I then told her she should care about kids who are already here and need help. My SIL got mad at me, and told me that I should be a \u201cbig girl\u201d and stop relying on my sister for help. \n\nI understand that my sister had her own stuff going on, but if roles were reversed I would choose to help my family. Especially if it was for something like this. My husband thinks I should just drop it, but I feel like my sister isn\u2019t seeing my side. AITA?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add ages.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I\u2019m asking my sister and SIL to help pay for my daughter\u2019s daycare for the first three months. After that I can pay for it, and pay them back.", "created_utc": 1690915706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fl586/aita_for_call_my_sister_selfish_for_not_helping/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How exactly do you plan to afford something in 3 months plus an extra re payment bill added on top of it if you couldn't afford it with your first paychecks? Do you have to pay 3 months in advance to enroll of something? I could see needing help for the 2 weeks or maybe 1 month while you wait to get your pay established but 3 months? That's excessive and seems like you just want to stack cash and not pay your bill at your sisters expense and maybe or maybe not ever pay her back. \n\nFurthermore, your sister is undergoing medical procedures that cost on average 12k PER TRY and the average number of try's required before it works is 6 and that's only for 2/3rd of couples. It could take longer and cost more.  I mean your sister could be looking at something like 50k just to have something you got to have for free via condomless sex. And that's not including all the costs that come with prenatal care and birth and then providing for the baby.  She is right to save every single penny for something so expensive and to prioritize her family. The fact that they make 3x as much means nothing when 100 percent of it is being eaten up every period cycle to the tune of 12k a month. That's an insane monthly bill to have even if you are the richest of rich. And IVF is TIMED. If they don't have the money to pay the bill THIS MONTH because they gave thier medical bill money to you the whole cycle is trashed, all the meds wasted, all the money already paid set on fire, and they have to start over from scratch 3 months later. IVF is time sensitive and pre planned long in advance. They are in the middle of a cycle that needs paid for.\n\nYou also implied that she doesn't deserve to have her own family just because you can't afford yours.

The only thing that she needs help with in this situation is her daughter, who unfortunately cannot be accommodated in cheaper daycares, but I don\u2019t see what else OP can do, it does appear that she is trying her best to provide for her kids, and only needs short-term support for her sister which she fully intends to pay back.\n\nIdk, it doesn\u2019t seem that unreasonable to me, and OP\u2019s sister could have decided to maybe draw up a legal contract if she was concerned about getting the money back, or help her sister find other solutions instead of just slamming the door shut in her face? It just feels like we don\u2019t know enough to just immediately condemn OP for needing help.", "I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. I was simply making a general point, not accusing anybody. And the reason I made that point is because people keep talking about how her sister isn\u2019t \u201cobligated to help her\u201d, and yet, OP never once said anything about obligations, or responsibilities, or making demands. OP *asked*. And, when her sister hesitated, she pleaded a bit more, because she is in a desperate situation. And then, in a moment of frustration, wrongly lashed out. That\u2019s the point I was trying to make.", "I think op has used the sister more then this one time. I say this because of the sil comment be a big girl and quit running to your sister.\n\nI think this may be the straw that may have broke the camels back. Because this time it\u2019s not just between sisters. This comment affect the sister marriage. And I don\u2019t see the sil being that forgiving. I know if it was my marriage my spouse wouldn\u2019t. And I am always going to choose my spouse over a sibling!", "You don't have to ask again to not back off. You back off by dropping it as soon as they say no. But continuing to pester in one situation, is not backing off.", "Same, I initially took it as she wanted them to watch her kid.", "If I am in need, I ask. But I make DAMNED SURE that them meeting that need, doesn't take away from their needs. They are not obligated to set themselves on fire to keep me warm and if I found out that by helping me they were setting themselves on fire? I'd extinguish the flames and kick their ass. I love them too much to allow them to be in need because they help me. They don't ask me for money, they have it, I do t. They ask me for other things...help, to fill in for them in various roles and I gladly do it, IF I CAN. THAT is a healthy family. Helping IF YOU CAN or as much as you can, without causing adverse issues for yourself. You can't save your drowning sister if you are still drowning from the last time you gave her your life jacket. OPs sister AND HER WIFE are trying to have a family. They have budgeted for that. That is a goal they are working towards...if they are in the throes of actively trying, that means medicines and hormones are being taken and monitored.....no. They should NOT interrupt what they are doing because OP wants to go to work. That is on OP. How long should OPs sister AND HER WIFE put their goals and dreams on hold??? She said she would pay them back OVER TIME. So, how long should they have to wait? If OP truly cared about the children already here, she should!don't have had the third child that she could not afford. Family should help family, I agree, but not at huge cost to themselves, unless it is something they are WILLING to do. No means no! There doesn't need to be any explanation. My sister and her husband's finances are frankly none of my business. She and I are close. Extremely close. But what her and HER HUSBAND do with their money is not my business. Why do I keep capping the HER WIFE, HER HUSBAND? Because there are TWO people in a marriage. TWO people whose budget for living is combined together. I am not one of the TWO when it comes to my sister and BIL. OP is not one of the TWO when it comes to her sister and her sisters WIFE. Tell us the truth...are you really OP on a separate account??", "Being weak is not the same thing as being decent. \n\nNot giving someone money isn't \"ruining their life.\" It sounds like you can't stand to see anyone else be even slightly uncomfortable so you bend over to appease everyone who ever has a problem. \n\nDo you seriously perceive this as someone \"ruining OP'S life\" because they won't give them the money they've demanded out of the blue? That is an utterly backwards, toxic attitude. If your life is \"ruined\" because you don't have something that someone else does, that isn't the fault of everyone who didn't give you *theirs*. It's your fault for counting on claiming things that belong to other people.", "I don\u2019t think these people are exactly financial wizards, seeing as they have three children and no savings. Plus most jobs you can get after being out of the workforce for 4+ years aren\u2019t great, unless OP has insanely valuable skills, which she doesn\u2019t, because if she did the father would logically have been the SAH parent.\n\nIn other words, sister and SIL would probably be kissing that money goodbye because the OP almost certainly won\u2019t be able to pay the ongoing expensive daycare and repay three months of it. Imagine trying to get that money back from someone this entitled and manipulative, it would be drama every single instalment. Given that SIL is clearly already sick of OP\u2019s shit, I\u2019m guessing something similar to this has already played out.", "The point you\u2019re making suggests that others have called the sister awful for asking.  The point we are all making is that everyone is fine with the sister asking. It\u2019s her response to the rejection that makes her the asshole. She had no right to lash out, because she\u2019s not entitled to any of her sisters money.", "Good point I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't the first time she asked but I'm just playing armchair redditor at this point lol", "You\u2019re forgetting that OP actually has an offer to work, and is trying to provide for her kids herself, but she stumbled upon the daycare problem which is completely out of her hands. I don\u2019t understand why people are insistent on assuming that OP is some lazy, entitled slob who has no interest in improving her life or that of her kids and would rather sit back and demand others sort out her life for her. People are so quick to assume that SIL is in the right, and that there is absolutely no possibility that she could just be biased and have personal issues with OP, or just hate helping OP in general. I just don\u2019t feel like we have enough info to automatically condemn OP. Idk, I tend to take people at face value so I know I could absolutely be wrong, but people on Reddit love to act like there is no possibility they could be wrong to always assume the worst in people.", "Yes, OP was absolutely the AH for the comment she made. But I feel like she was just hurt, and desperate, and I don\u2019t agree that she had no right to be upset. If OP and her sister are very close, or at least had a close relationship growing up, then I can understand why it would hurt her to be abandoned by the sister she loves. This may not be the case, of course, but the point I am trying to make is that we do not have enough context to be able to just automatically condemn OP.", "Lol! The comment from the sil is the reason I think that. Plus op had such an entitlement to the money is another reason. \n\nBut your right at this point we are\nGuessing. But usually if you pay attention the posters usually give you little hints without meaning too.", "You take people at face value, but you don\u2019t believe the sister when she says she can\u2019t afford it?", "She\u2019s going to be working as a **receptionist**. Does that sound like a job that can both continue to pay for expensive daycare while also repaying the first three months of expensive daycare (thousands of dollars)? \n\nI\u2019m not implying she\u2019s lazy, I\u2019m implying she\u2019s either stupid or lying and there\u2019s no way in hell the sister is getting paid back. Tbh from the post the other day about the house repair loan really demonstrated that 99% of families lack any form of integrity with how many people said \u201cmoney loaned to family is money given\u201d. When it\u2019s family that also thinks their poorly planned life is more important than yours *and* that it\u2019s actually your responsibility, don\u2019t even think about it. \n\nYeah, if I were SIL I\u2019d also hate helping OP, seeing as in context they obviously have before and it\u2019s just fed her sense of entitlement. This woman literally thinks they should delay having their own baby to support hers.", "Being \u201churt and desperate\u201d is no excuse for lashing out at other people and giving them your pain. Yes, she had every right to be upset; but no right to visit that anger upon her sister.  Don\u2019t make your problem my problem.", "That\u2019s not what I said. I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t believe her. I\u2019m saying that OP told us her sister has more than enough to cover both the IVF and to help her out for a short amount of time, but that we can\u2019t know the truth either way. All we can do is make a decision based on the information given, but people immediately jump to the assumption that the sister and SIL are perfect, and that OP is this terrible monster, and act like there is not even a *single* shred of possibility that there may be more to the story."]}
