She gave birth to 3 boys - the eldest has since come out as trans, and has stated that she doesnt want children and is undergoing full body surgery.

I walked over to the car, told her she can't be saying things like that, before she tells me that I must give her a grandchild as I am not doing my duties as a wife otherwise.

I am so sorry you even think you might be TA here. \nShe is COMPLETETLY out of line, you were right to stand up to her.\nYou owe her NOTHING. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. \nIf you and your husband want kids that's your decision not hers!!!!! \nYour husband also needs to have a chat with her and tell your MIL to back away this is absurd. \nABSELOUTLY NTA", "NTA. You don't owe her a grandchild. This isn't the 1500s; women aren't only useful for providing heirs. It sounds like your husband is trying to be understanding of your reasoning for not wanting a child, and that's the important thing. And \"he'll know what's coming to him\"? That's not threatening at all... There's nothing wrong with being excited for grandchildren, but she is taking it much, *much* too far.", "NTA. She was incredibly out of line. You are in NO WAY the AH here. She doesn\u2019t own your body and you don\u2019t owe her anything. Throwing you shade on FB was petty and immature. You do you and your family decisions aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s business except for you and your husband. And there is not room for toxic people in your life.", "NTA but your MIL and husband both are. He needs to stand up to his mother and not just wait until you finally come around and do it.", "NTA she indeed does not own your uterus.", "NTA\n\nI am just WAITING for the day my MIL pulls a stunt like that (My hubs is the only child so.....any day now, I'm sure).   My ass would be in the doctor's office that day, getting a consult about having my tubes tied.  \n\nThe only one who should get to decide if you carry a baby is YOU.", "NTA. She DOESN\u2019T own your uterus, and having children isn\u2019t a requirement of being a good and loved daughter-in-law. That\u2019s some seriously misdirected rage from MIL.", "NTA \n\nBut you need to have a serious talk with your husband. He has to back you up 100% and tell his mom that the subject is now off limits to her, that she must cease and desist from discussing it to him, to you, on FB and any other social media. It's NOT her decision to make nor is it ANY of her business. \n\nI must caution you, however, because it sounds like he's actually not on the same page as you. You have trauma issues that he'll never fully understand. You both need marriage counseling and you need separate therapy for your trauma. I wish you only the best.", "NTA- OP, your mother in law does not, in fact, own your uterus. \n\nHer desires for grandchildren have no bearing on you. If she's that desperate for more kids, she can adopt or have them herself.", "NTA \n\nI have one child. My one child owes me NOTHING! Including  grandchildren. My child is an adult. My child is child free by choice. I don't own her uterus. It's hers. Her body. Her choice. Your body. Your choice.\n\nYour mother-in-law does not own your uterus. Her overbearing desire for biological grandchildren is  a problem.", "I'm gonna say, NTA, because you're right. She's pressuring you two to have children you're not ready for. You do not owe her children. She's not owed grandchildren. If she wants something small to love, I suggest a dog.", "NTA at all. She sounds awful, and astoundingly entitled. \u201cWithholding a child\u201d is a wild accusation", "NTA and your husband shouldn't have thanked you, he should have stood up for you instead of pressuring you.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband are behaving responsibly: if you are not ready, financially and emotionally, having a child at the wrong time could lead to the breakdown of the marriage, rather than consolidating the family. \n\n Tell MIL that if she loves children so much, she can volunteer at the local children's hospital or even foster some troubled children.  Or does she want grandchildren without obligation just to show photos of them on social media to her friends?", "NTA", "NTA.", "Lol, NTA. You aren\u2019t an object, nor did you sign a contract with her stating you would give her a child. If she wants a child that badly, she can adopt one. The other siblings have just as much of a say over their bodies as do you.", "NTA and I would be VERY concerned. Not as much about MIL. I would have a serious\u2026curiosity about your husbands abilities to put up and KEEP up healthy boundaries. Please DO NOT make a child until he\u2019s got a better focus on his priorities. Hint. The priority IS not his mom.", "NTA. If she wants to be upset about it, don't let it become your problem. Don't feed into her dramatics. She's going to have to deal with whatever you and your husband decide to do, whether she likes it or not. It's not like she can force you to have a kid. The issue I see here is that she does seem to have some hold over your husband and can manipulate/guilt him, so he should be addressing that. Maybe he could benefit from talking to a professional.", "NTA.  All you did was state the truth.", "NTA because you're right.", "NTA. Your MIL is a crazy person, though.", "NTA, repeat after me \"my uterus, my rules\".\n\nBonus points if you respond that at a family event.\nMore bonus points if it's in a firm voice with stern eye contact.\n I don't know what it is about uteruses (uteri?), but people are so happy to discuss how they should be used even if they don't belong to them.", "NTA, by all means, unless your husband is able to go no contact with his Mom, there is no way on earth a vulnerable child should ever be exposed to her. Can you afford therapy for your husband? I can\u2019t imagine how damaging she has been for him throughout his life.", "I didn't think I was, but past trauma about being bullied in a manner like this after standing up for myself had me second guessing myself.", "I\u2019m a MIL. I would NEVER EVER do this to my in-laws. None of my businesses nor my discussion to have.", "She has a dog, two cats and her youngest still lives at home. You think she would have enough to do at home but no, somehow still has time to bully her son into children \ud83d\ude14", "I'm so sorry you've been put through all this, I'd talk to your husband about distancing abit from MIL she sounds like a certain type xx", "Yeah, I would establish boundaries regarding your family life real quick. She has no place to urge you when you're not even in the right place financially. Does she want to see you guys struggle to raise this child???", "I'm unsure. What's confusing is that my husband and I currently live with my Mother (as I only got my Green card last month and we are almost done with saving to move out). I don't know if someone told her we were saving and thought we had money for a child, but we certainly are not in the financial situation for one", "That's okay. Congratulations on your green card, by the way! \n\nMaybe your hubby mentioned you're saving up and she assumed you just had excess to fund a whole new human. She sounds really entitled, like she's used to getting her way."]}
