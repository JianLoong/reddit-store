You don't owe her a grandchild. This isn't the 1500s; women aren't only useful for providing heirs. It sounds like your husband is trying to be understanding of your reasoning for not wanting a child, and that's the important thing. And \"he'll know what's coming to him\"? That's not threatening at all... There's nothing wrong with being excited for grandchildren, but she is taking it much, *much* too far.", "NTA. She was incredibly out of line. You are in NO WAY the AH here. She doesn\u2019t own your body and you don\u2019t owe her anything. Throwing you shade on FB was petty and immature.

He has to back you up 100% and tell his mom that the subject is now off limits to her, that she must cease and desist from discussing it with him, to you, on FB and any other social media. It's NOT her decision to make nor is it ANY of her business. \n\nI must caution you, however, because it sounds like he's actually not on the same page as you. You have trauma issues that he'll never fully understand. You both need marriage counseling and you need separate therapy for your trauma. I wish you only the best.", "NTA- OP, your mother in law does not, in fact, own your uterus. \n\nHer desires for grandchildren have no bearing on you. If she's that desperate for more kids, she can adopt or have them herself.", "NTA \n\nI have one child. My one child owes me NOTHING! Including  grandchildren. My child is an adult. My child is child free by choice. I don't own her uterus. It's hers. Her body. Her choice. Your body. Your choice.\n\nYour mother-in-law does not own your uterus. Her overbearing desire for biological grandchildren is  a problem.", "I'm gonna say, NTA, because you're right. She's pressuring you two to have children you're not ready for. You do not owe her children. She's not owed grandchildren. If she wants something small to love, I suggest a dog.", "NTA at all. She sounds awful, and astoundingly entitled. \u201cWithholding a child\u201d is a wild accusation", "NTA and your husband shouldn't have thanked you, he should have stood up for you instead of pressuring you.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband are behaving responsibly: if you are not ready, financially and emotionally, having a child at the wrong time could lead to the breakdown of the marriage, rather than consolidating the family. \n\n Tell MIL that if she loves children so much, she can volunteer at the local children's hospital or even foster some troubled children.  Or does she want grandchildren without obligation just to show photos of them on social media to her friends?", "NTA", "NTA.", "Lol, NTA. You aren\u2019t an object, nor did you sign a contract with her stating you would give her a child. If she wants a child that badly, she can adopt one. The other siblings have just as much of a say over their bodies as do you.", "NTA and I would be VERY concerned. Not as much about MIL. I would have a serious\u2026curiosity about your husbands abilities to put up and KEEP up healthy boundaries. Please DO NOT make a child until he\u2019s got a better focus on his priorities. Hint. The priority IS not his mom.", "NTA. If she wants to be upset about it, don't let it become your problem. Don't feed into her dramatics. She's going to have to deal with whatever you and your husband decide to do, whether she likes it or not. It's not like she can force you to have a kid. The issue I see here is that she does seem to have some hold over your husband and can manipulate/guilt him, so he should be addressing that. Maybe he could benefit from talking to a professional.", "NTA.  All you did was state the truth.", "NTA because you're right.", "NTA. Your MIL is a crazy person, though.", "NTA, repeat after me \"my uterus, my rules\".\n\nBonus points if you respond that at a family event.\nMore bonus points if it's in a firm voice with stern eye contact.\n I don't know what it is about uteruses (uteri?), but people are so happy to discuss how they should be used even if they don't belong to them.", "NTA, by all means, unless your husband is able to go no contact with his Mom, there is no way on earth a vulnerable child should ever be exposed to her.

She has no place to urge you when you're not even in the right place financially. Does she want to see you guys struggle to raise this child???", "I'm unsure. What's confusing is that my husband and I currently live with my Mother (as I only got my Green card last month and we are almost done with saving to move out). I don't know if someone told her we were saving and thought we had money for a child, but we certainly are not in the financial situation for one", "That's okay. Congratulations on your green card, by the way! \n\nMaybe your hubby mentioned you're saving up and she assumed you just had excess to fund a whole new human. She sounds really entitled, like she's used to getting her way.", "NTA.  Your husband needs to shutting her down every time she brings it up.  \n\n\"he'll know what is coming to him\"  What did she mean by that?  He's going into timeout.  He's going to have write punishment lines.  He won't get supper.  That's a bizarre comment to make.", "NTA\u2014 So she wants a grandchild\u2014 that\u2019s fine, but you don\u2019t owe her one. If he had thought that having a baby to make mother happy was the most important thing to him, he could have told you on the first date that. I told men on my first dates and sooner that I wanted babies, so I don\u2019t have a lot of sympathy when people find out after marriage that they\u2019re incompatible on the baby-front. So her problem is with him. \nBesides, even if you wanted a baby, that\u2019s just a first ingredient. You could be trying for all she knows. Lots of men want everyone to think it\u2019s the woman\u2019s lack of cooperation when it\u2019s his lack of sperm. It\u2019s just cruel and medieval yelling at a daughter in law for lack of babies.", "NTA\n\nThe obligations some people think their adult children have are ridiculous. It\u2019s not your job to make her legacy.   \nThe people she knows on social media are likely aware of her controlling nature. Ignore.", "NTA.  Husband needs to check his mother and stop being spineless.", "NTA, but...\n\nYou admit your husband wants a family, he frequently talks about having children, and you always shut him down. Does he agree with your reasons on why you think you two shouldn't have kids or does he just go along? Seems like the two of you aren't on the same page as far as what you want out of your marriage/family. You & your husband need to sit down to have a serious conversation.", "NTA\nBecause she wants a grandchild,is no reason to have a baby.\nBaby = life log commitment.", "That's disgusting. Her not you. NTA OP. You're not an incubator and her lack of grandchildren isn't your responsibility. You do need to make sure you and your husband are on the same page about having kids without pressure from his mother.", "NTA. She doesn't own you or her son and you don't \"have\" to ever have a child if you don't wish to. I'd be putting her on my \"low or no contact\" list for sure. As an aside, your 27-year-old husband shouldn't need you to stand up to his mother. HE should be standing up for YOU.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that someone would want to be a grandparent.  It is not understandable when that person insists on a daughter-in-law accommodating that desire regardless of her own wishes in the matter. It is your body, your financial obligation, your time, your choice.  The grandma wannabe can either go pound sand or learn to be patient until you are good and ready to take on parenting.", "NTA and WTF? Even if you do ever have a kid, I wouldn\u2019t let that woman near them. Ugh. Seriously, what is wrong with people?", "NTA.\n\nIf or when you and your husband decide to have children, make sure your in-laws are aware that they are YOUR children and not THEIRS. Your MIL is demanding grandchildren, what\u2019s stopping her from \u201craising them as her own\u201d?!", "INFO: This isn't about the mother-in-law being out of line as she is, but in conversations with your husband, are you two on the same level of understanding? It's not clear if he's brought up having kids only because of his mother's demands or because he wants kids as well, and it's also not clear where you stand on it. For your part in it, some of your language suggests that you're not interested in having kids at all, but the reason you say you explain all frame it as relatively temporary. If your real view is \"I don't want kids\" then it seems disingenuous to just use the temporary issues with your husband to put off further discussion.", "NTA but your husband doesn't have your back here. Make sure your birth control is in order, I recommend an IUD or something that can't be tampered with.", "NTA. She is", "Absolutely, NTA.", "NTA. Stand your ground with your MIL.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's unhinged.

Nothing makes you the asshole for standing up for yourself\n\nNTA", "NTA let her hire a plane to sky write it across the city. It\u2019s not your problem and you don\u2019t owe her anything. You should probably also tell her every time she mentions it to either of you, you\u2019ll put it off for another year.", "NTA - I have two sons.  One is married.  Would I love to have a grand baby?  Sure!  However, my DIL isn't sure she wants kids.  Not my business - not my life, not my body.  I would never (by conscious choice) try to pressure her into having a child she isn't 100% ready to have and raise.", "NTA\n\n61F, CSA survivor. I'm childfree by choice.  I know how easy it is to second guess yourself. The guilt for standing up for yourself will lessen with time, it's always lurking in the shadows.\n\nYou need to have a very serious conversation with your husband regarding boundaries.  He needs to step up.\n\nIf MIL wants another child in her life so badly, there's always foster care and adoption.  So many children looking for caring caregivers.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe anyone a child and she\u2019s gross for her behavior", "NTA. But get in social media and answer her you are not withholding anything, but her threats of forcing you to have a child to appease her when you are not ready and not financially stable show she only cares for herself. You don't exist to give her grandchildren.", "Oh, OP, how I love your backbone. While your husband thanked you for standing up to his AH mother, he needs to be patient with the traumas you've suffered and be more assertive around his mother. You don't mention if you're in therapy, but I hope you are. Clearly NTA.", "Nta. This is a huge red flag. If you and hubby aren't on the same page, get into counseling now. Mil has no right to your body and I am proud of you for standing up to her.", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you for confronting her. Your MIL needs to learn boundaries, and it's important that you and your husband approach this as a team rather than him letting you be the \"bad cop\" that enforces limits with her. IMO both of you need to be on the same page about shutting her down if she brings up this topic again. Also, I suggest you both consider blocking her on FB/all social media as she is not above stirring up drama there.", "NTA. Your husband needs to intervene with this or you\u2019ll have a serious decision to make. You shouldn\u2019t be being pressured by his mother", "NTA, but your comment that your husband \u201cthanked you for standing up to her\u201d concerns me. Does your husband stand up to her about the same issue?\n\nYou said that he wants a family and you have to be the voice of reason that it\u2019s not a good time. Have you two gone to counseling about this issue?", "She doesn\u2019t own your uterus.\nShe\u2019s treating you like a brood mare. \n\nNTA", "NTA but honestly, talk with your Husband. I personally would go low / no contact with her, depending on how she reacts to announcing the reduced Contact etc.", "NTA.\n\n>I overheard her telling him he must have a child in the next two years, or 'he will know what is coming to him'. \n\nI would actually challenge this comment and ask her what she means by this, because this sounds like some sort of threats. \n\nShe is clearly entitled, and your husband needs to set clear boundaries about respecting your choices. You also need to have a conversation with your husband about his own feelings towards being a dad, and his seemingly constant desire to please his mother. \nThis brings the question of your husband caring for his dad, and how much pressure is being put on him to be the perfect son, and guilt trip. Is there a reason why your MIL can't look after her husband (although I get needing a break)? In any case, he may need to speak to someone.\n\nI would also say that if your husband and yourself decided to ever have a child then you should consider going NC or LC, or at least keep her at arms length because she is manipulative and toxic. If she say anything you can simply say that you cannot trust someone that is so horrible to you on social media.", "OP - it is your body , your choice, and only you and your husband can agree if and when you will try for a baby.  Bravo for you to stand up to your overbearing, interfering. rude, and selfish MIL.  She should be ashamed of herself.   I do think you and your OH need to have a frank discussion and to be on the same page, because it seems he succumb to his mother bullying.   And when you do decide to have a baby make sure you set boundary of how often MIL can see the child as l have no doubt she will criticise, belittle, and undermine you at every turn about how to look after a baby.", "NTA\nEesh, I can already imagine all of the boundary stomping that woman will attempt if/when you do decide to have a baby.", "NTA.  Outrageous behaviour by your mother-in-law and you did well to stand up to her.  If you have a baby it must be in your time, no one else's.  Hopefully your husband continues to support you.  I don't know what the law is where you are, but in UK I would be thinking of reporting her to police for harassment.  Her comments on facebook after her comments face-to-face can't be allowed to be repeated.  I wish you wisdom and all the best in dealing with her.", "NAH.

It's pathetic", "This is going to be unpopular, but I'm going with ESH, MIL the least.\n\nShe has her preferences and has communicated them privately with her son. She may want the OP to have kids but she confines that hope to private conversations with her son.\n\nThe pressure from the husband came out of his mouth. The words that he speaks are his. If he mouths what his mom wants him to, that is because he is an asshole.\n\nThe OPs rudeness to MIL. 1) anger doesn't justify rudeness. and wasn't really called for. (Accidental eavesdropping is still eavesdropping.) The OP is displacing anger that should be directed at husband to his mom.\n\nAnd, of course, the OP can get pregnant on her schedule,\n\nAnd before I comment on the family internet posters, I'd want to know if they were commenting on the OPs rudeness or on her lack of children.", "[removed]", "NTA, look of course your MIL can't force you to have a kid, obviously. But it does sound like your husband has been clear that HE does want kids so you two need to decide if that's on the table. If you keep stalling eventually this will blow up spectacularly because you want very different things. So get counseling and figure out if you should remain married at all or if you each should be with different people who share you lives intentions.", "NTA. Sounds like you need to go no contact with this toxic person. How overbearing and miserable do you think she would be if you were raising a kid that she had access to? She would undermine all your parenting decisions and stomp on all your boundaries. I guarantee you she'd even call your future child \"her child\" constantly. Yuck. Get some distance from her for your own sanity.", "YTA. Your husband wants kids, just divorce already.", "Right, I think they need to both think through if they want a child or not, and if they do if they want to go through pregnancy or adopt.\n\nBecause it's not something that can be put off forever, and one person just going along with the other can cause major resentment.\n\nEven without the MIL what if the husband increasingly feels like he wants kids over the next 10 years and she doesn't? She could find herself going through a divorce.", "[removed]", "AMEN!", "I'm unsure but my husband is waiting until my siblings go to bed before telling me, so I'm a little worried", "I think the issue with going no contact with the mom is that if she is power of attorney, she could restrict and/ or deny access to his father.

He wants a family, and is for the most part understanding, but will slip it in on occasion.", "No, for it's out of our price range, but we will be having a conversation to move forward tonight. It would have given him time to reflect on things I said to him after this happened, and I should have a result soon on how we plan to move forward. \n\nWe do however plan to get counseling in the future, even if it's just to keep our relationship a healthy one", "As someone from the UK, I considered it, but my family plan on moving soon, and I've blocked her on social media already", "What did OP say that was rude?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You should go to r/justnomil, they will have excellent advice for dealing with your mil!", "Childfree by choice person here this is my verdict to you: you are NTA on this\n\nYou are not a bad DIL for standing up to MIL and making it clear you will not be having any kids until you are 100 percent ready. Who does she think she is? The reproduction police? \n\nMoving forward you and husband continue to be a united front. Be careful if MIL sneaks into your home when you are both not aware in case she might sabotage your contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills and condoms) all to get a grandchild. If I am your close friend, I would gladly tell her off for you and husband", "NTA. She has serious issues.", "You have to go No Contact with the MIL\n\n\nShe has no concept of boundaries, and based on her actions, may have psychological issues as well ... I'd stay away from her if I were you.\n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA- and I\u2019m SOO glad your bf backed you up. Your MOL has lost her mind.", "I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t read this, but based on the title. NTA. My in-laws have decided they are the best parents in the world and alienate their grandchildren\u2019s parents to boss the kids around. They aren\u2019t my kids and the parents allow it so I don\u2019t argue, but my god", "Children, while they can be amazing, are expensive, hard work, tiring, noisy and just see how you feel when one of yours is sick or injured.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is nobody should ever be pressured into having them so you are totally NTA and a smart person for waiting until perhaps you, your husband and your circumstances are in a place that makes you want to have one or more.", "NTA.\n\nThis troubles me so much.  I'm an only child, Husband and I chose to be childfree, and I got no end of hell for it from my mother for about the first decade and a half of our marriage before she gave up.  (Something about me refusing to engage in arguments around that time, and only replying with the fiercest, freezes-water expression possible.)   I am absolutely certain that my dad never pestered either of us about it, because he would consider such a sensitive, personal topic off-limits, though he would've celebrated grandchildren. \n\nNot that I'm troubled much about a parent demanding grandkids, though the demand part is clearly wrong.  Wanting is absolutely okay.  I am bothered about a spouse not standing up for their beloved fully and completely.   My mother rarely brought the topic up in front of my husband, because he demonstrated early on that he was not going to tolerate her BS when it was targeted at either of us, though he was always pretty gracious about it.  Still, she got the message.  She hoped to wear me down and convince me to stop taking my birth control pills, and get pregnant without his consent!  Didn't work, and I will refrain from calling her names, only because she was raised in an environment where women of a certain age without grandchildren were considered less than.  RIP Mom, and I'm sad that I couldn't give you the picket-fence grandparenthood existence you wanted, but also sad that you refused to make other choices to enrich your retired life.", "NTA. I truly don't understand these grandparent obsessions. My daughter is 24 and came out to me as bi, polyamorous, and probably going to adopt IF she every decided to have a child, and I'm perfectly happy and supportive of her decisions to have or not have a child. Honestly, the adoption thing I love the idea of if it should happen because I was adopted from foster care and I know what a difference it can make to both the parents and the children. \n\nYou're absolutely right, she does NOT own your uterus!", "NTA Before my wedding I was told by a very wise woman that I needed to establish quickly to my MIL that there was a new sheriff in town and she didn\u2019t own my or my husband.  Sounds harsh but sure enough, she criticized my husband and I laid down the law \u201cYou don\u2019t speak about MY HUSBAND in that manner\u2019. Sadly you have to do that with some people", "NTA.

You are not a prop in her fantasy and you do NOT owe her anything. \n\nWhat a disgusting asshole she is.", "NTA - I always wanted grandchildren . . . and told my son I would have loved to have grandchildren. He didn't want any children and I told him I understood and would never hold it against him or his partner. It's NOT MY BUSINESS if he chooses to have a child or not .", "NTA.   \nIf you do have children, you MIL should not be told. She sounds deranged.", "Everyone is gay and trans on reddit", "NTA. But also if you do want children don\u2019t leave it too late. You never know if it will take time etc & honestly you spend what you earn & so never feel financially ready to have a child. Obviously don\u2019t have one just to appease her but be weary of deciding to not have one yet to spite her & then regretting it later.", "Wow she is something else. You don't owe her a child, much less one you don't want or aren't ready for. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds awful.", "Info: what does she mean by \"he will know what's coming to him\"?", "nta", "NTA - you do not owe her anything. If you do have a baby - that is your baby before  her grandchild, and I would never let her babysit.", "Seems to me the problem is you have a fundamental difference with your husband over having children. This won\u2019t go away, and will get worse if you two continue to have different feelings about it. You really need to consider the future of your relationship if you desire two different things. And don\u2019t string the poor guy along either while you try to make up your mind.", "What a loon. Nta", "What on earth is the supposed consequence of you don\u2019t have a baby in two years??

Those kind of people will do anything. And I'm guessing she already have access to your house so...\n\nI'd be very cautious if I was in your place. And do have a long conversation about this issue with your husband. It's vital to know his opinion on this matter. And go NC if needed", "NTA. What did she mean by \u201che will know what is coming to him\u201d? That is really weird.", "Nta for the mother-in-law thing but you need to really talk to your husband and Hammer it out whether or not you're going to have children whether that's by adoption or biological because you say he keeps laying slip about having children well there's your answer he wants them and obviously he's not okay with not having them and it's not really something you can compromise about it's either you're not having kids or you are having kids so I think you need to decide which camp you belong to", "Nta. Wow that woman is psychotic", "NTA. I think MIL made enough of an ass of herself with her crazy FB post. \"Withholding\" a grandchild??? In what world does that make sense???", "I am jumping on the top comments to add, because this is VERY CONCERNING, whatever birth control you use, make sure you have it with you at all times. People this crazy about procreation could tamper with your pills/condoms to force the issue. PLEASE PLEASE have a sit down with your husband and really truly make sure you guys are on the same page. NTA", "This, it was not your responsibility to put mil in her place. Hubs needs to cut the apron strings with mom", "Agree. NTA because MIL has no business in this discussion. But her husband does. And OP needs to be clear with herself and her husband whether she doesn't want kids *now* or whether she doesn't want kids ever. It sounds like she's been giving potentially temporary reasons that leave him with hope they will have kids someday, so if that's not what she wants then it's time to say so!", "If OP is willing maybe bring up some aspect of her trauma, try to shame her MIL with it. But only so much as she\u2019s comfortable with saying and the MIL knowing.", "Yea, we are going to discuss this later tonight once my siblings go to bed so we can have a serious heart to heart about the topic", "I mean, judging by OP's post history it sounds like they're not having sex so it doesn't sound like this is a huge worry....", "It never hurts to be extra vigilant and careful.", "Yes and thank you, friend! :-)", "With the way she's carrying on, you're already dealing with an adult toddler. If you really want to go scorched earth, tell her she's a child enough for you both to deal with right now.", "I've said it before and you can say it to MIL: if she is so desperate to secure a grandchild, she is free to adopt any of the hundreds of teen parents in foster care. Instant grand baby! Possibly more than one! \n\nBut of course, that would mean to achieve her goal she would have to take all the work and expense on herself rather than demanding it of you and just sailing in when she feels like it to play weekend Grandma...\n\nNTA, OP. If she does have the audacity to bring it up again, tell her the above and every time she brings it up after that, remind her that you're not denying her a grandchild.

As long as you're undecided and not actually a no that you're trying to force into a yes for the sake of the marriage, you've got time to figure it out. At least a few years if you're in good health, maybe even more if you decide you want only one or two kids. Don't let anyone pressure you otherwise with comments about hitting your early 30s or anything like that (the \"two years or else\" thing is really nasty, but your MIL is a piece of work!).", "Maybe true but it only takes one time!", "OP is much more aware of the reality of having a child and what it takes, knowing she doesn\u2019t have the security of all those things.

Not financially in a place for them to begin with.", "Above all, OP: **Do not make the mistake of thinking that this will end if you have a child. If you have a child, she will cross every boundary and violate every rule to spend every minute with that child.** You think she's fast to criticize you now? Wait until you discipline her darling grandchild, or even just dress your child differently from how grandma wants it. She is going to be ALL OVER you and your parenting. \n\nShe will *always* continue to act like a boundary-violating asshole, because that is who she is, *and she's had no negative consequences from that behavior*. Having a kid is only going to make her worse. (In fact, she's probably going to feel justified and proud of how much she pushed you, so she's going to be *even more* meddlesome when it comes to how her one and only darling grandchild is treated. She doesn't think you're a good wife; she'll never think you're a good mother, either.) \n\nThere is *one* and *only* one way to improve her behavior, and that is setting boundaries and enforcing consequences. Your husband needs to grow a spine and start standing up to his mom. You overheard her *threaten* him - ask him what exactly that's about. What kinds of threats is she making? How much is she emotionally abusing him? How long will it take him to set clear boundaries and put a stop to this? \n\nShe needs to be told that these behaviors are abusive and harassing, and if she continues to act this way, you will be reducing the level of contact you have. And then DO IT. \n\nShe's never had negative consequences for her horrible behavior. Start giving her some, or accept that you're giving up your peace and quiet for as long as she wants to be around.", "You\u2019ve got a good head on your shoulders.", "All of this.  NTA, OP", "THIS"]}
