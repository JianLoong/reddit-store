You don't owe her a grandchild. This isn't the 1500s; women aren't only useful for providing heirs. It sounds like your husband is trying to be understanding of your reasoning for not wanting a child, and that's the important thing. And \"he'll know what's coming to him\"? That's not threatening at all... There's nothing wrong with being excited for grandchildren, but she is taking it much, *much* too far.", "NTA. She was incredibly out of line. You are in NO WAY the AH here. She doesn\u2019t own your body and you don\u2019t owe her anything. Throwing you shade on FB was petty and immature.

He needs to stand up to his mother and not just wait until you finally come around and do it.", "NTA she indeed does not own your uterus.", "NTA\n\nI am just WAITING for the day my MIL pulls a stunt like that (My hubs is the only child so.....any day now, I'm sure).   My ass would be in the doctor's office that day, getting a consult about having my tubes tied.  \n\nThe only one who should get to decide if you carry a baby is YOU.", "NTA. She DOESN\u2019T own your uterus, and having children isn\u2019t a requirement of being a good and loved daughter-in-law. That\u2019s some seriously misdirected rage from MIL.", "NTA \n\nBut you need to have a serious talk with your husband. He has to back you up 100% and tell his mom that the subject is now off limits to her, that she must cease and desist from discussing it with him, to you, on FB and any other social media. It's NOT her decision to make nor is it ANY of her business. \n\nI must caution you, however, because it sounds like he's actually not on the same page as you. You have trauma issues that he'll never fully understand. You both need marriage counseling and you need separate therapy for your trauma. I wish you only the best.", "NTA- OP, your mother in law does not, in fact, own your uterus. \n\nHer desires for grandchildren have no bearing on you. If she's that desperate for more kids, she can adopt or have them herself.", "NTA \n\nI have one child. My one child owes me NOTHING! Including  grandchildren. My child is an adult. My child is child free by choice. I don't own her uterus. It's hers. Her body. Her choice. Your body. Your choice.\n\nYour mother-in-law does not own your uterus. Her overbearing desire for biological grandchildren is  a problem.", "I'm gonna say, NTA, because you're right. She's pressuring you two to have children you're not ready for. You do not owe her children. She's not owed grandchildren. If she wants something small to love, I suggest a dog.", "NTA at all. She sounds awful, and astoundingly entitled. \u201cWithholding a child\u201d is a wild accusation", "NTA and your husband shouldn't have thanked you, he should have stood up for you instead of pressuring you.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband are behaving responsibly: if you are not ready, financially and emotionally, having a child at the wrong time could lead to the breakdown of the marriage, rather than consolidating the family. \n\n Tell MIL that if she loves children so much, she can volunteer at the local children's hospital or even foster some troubled children.  Or does she want grandchildren without obligation just to show photos of them on social media to her friends?", "NTA", "NTA.", "Lol, NTA. You aren\u2019t an object, nor did you sign a contract with her stating you would give her a child. If she wants a child that badly, she can adopt one. The other siblings have just as much of a say over their bodies as do you.", "NTA and I would be VERY concerned. Not as much about MIL. I would have a serious\u2026curiosity about your husbands abilities to put up and KEEP up healthy boundaries. Please DO NOT make a child until he\u2019s got a better focus on his priorities. Hint. The priority IS not his mom.", "NTA. If she wants to be upset about it, don't let it become your problem. Don't feed into her dramatics. She's going to have to deal with whatever you and your husband decide to do, whether she likes it or not. It's not like she can force you to have a kid. The issue I see here is that she does seem to have some hold over your husband and can manipulate/guilt him, so he should be addressing that. Maybe he could benefit from talking to a professional.", "NTA.  All you did was state the truth.", "NTA because you're right.", "NTA. Your MIL is a crazy person, though.", "NTA, repeat after me \"my uterus, my rules\".\n\nBonus points if you respond that at a family event.\nMore bonus points if it's in a firm voice with stern eye contact.\n I don't know what it is about uteruses (uteri?), but people are so happy to discuss how they should be used even if they don't belong to them.", "NTA, by all means, unless your husband is able to go no contact with his Mom, there is no way on earth a vulnerable child should ever be exposed to her.

I would NEVER EVER do this to my in-laws. None of my businesses nor my discussion to have.", "She has a dog, two cats and her youngest still lives at home.

She has no place to urge you when you're not even in the right place financially. Does she want to see you guys struggle to raise this child???", "I'm unsure. What's confusing is that my husband and I currently live with my Mother (as I only got my Green card last month and we are almost done with saving to move out). I don't know if someone told her we were saving and thought we had money for a child, but we certainly are not in the financial situation for one", "That's okay. Congratulations on your green card, by the way! \n\nMaybe your hubby mentioned you're saving up and she assumed you just had excess to fund a whole new human. She sounds really entitled, like she's used to getting her way.", "NTA.  Your husband needs to shutting her down every time she brings it up.  \n\n\"he'll know what is coming to him\"  What did she mean by that?  He's going into timeout.  He's going to have write punishment lines.  He won't get supper.  That's a bizarre comment to make.", "NTA\u2014 So she wants a grandchild\u2014 that\u2019s fine, but you don\u2019t owe her one. If he had thought that having a baby to make mother happy was the most important thing to him, he could have told you on the first date that. I told men on my first dates and sooner that I wanted babies, so I don\u2019t have a lot of sympathy when people find out after marriage that they\u2019re incompatible on the baby-front. So her problem is with him. \nBesides, even if you wanted a baby, that\u2019s just a first ingredient. You could be trying for all she knows. Lots of men want everyone to think it\u2019s the woman\u2019s lack of cooperation when it\u2019s his lack of sperm. It\u2019s just cruel and medieval yelling at a daughter in law for lack of babies.", "NTA\n\nThe obligations some people think their adult children have are ridiculous. It\u2019s not your job to make her legacy.   \nThe people she knows on social media are likely aware of her controlling nature. Ignore.", "NTA.  Husband needs to check his mother and stop being spineless.", "NTA, but...\n\nYou admit your husband wants a family, he frequently talks about having children, and you always shut him down. Does he agree with your reasons on why you think you two shouldn't have kids or does he just go along? Seems like the two of you aren't on the same page as far as what you want out of your marriage/family. You & your husband need to sit down to have a serious conversation.", "NTA\nBecause she wants a grandchild,is no reason to have a baby.\nBaby = life log commitment.", "That's disgusting. Her not you. NTA OP. You're not an incubator and her lack of grandchildren isn't your responsibility. You do need to make sure you and your husband are on the same page about having kids without pressure from his mother.", "NTA. She doesn't own you or her son and you don't \"have\" to ever have a child if you don't wish to. I'd be putting her on my \"low or no contact\" list for sure. As an aside, your 27-year-old husband shouldn't need you to stand up to his mother. HE should be standing up for YOU.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that someone would want to be a grandparent.  It is not understandable when that person insists on a daughter-in-law accommodating that desire regardless of her own wishes in the matter. It is your body, your financial obligation, your time, your choice.  The grandma wannabe can either go pound sand or learn to be patient until you are good and ready to take on parenting.", "NTA and WTF? Even if you do ever have a kid, I wouldn\u2019t let that woman near them. Ugh. Seriously, what is wrong with people?", "NTA.\n\nIf or when you and your husband decide to have children, make sure your in-laws are aware that they are YOUR children and not THEIRS. Your MIL is demanding grandchildren, what\u2019s stopping her from \u201craising them as her own\u201d?!", "INFO: This isn't about the mother-in-law being out of line as she is, but in conversations with your husband, are you two on the same level of understanding? It's not clear if he's brought up having kids only because of his mother's demands or because he wants kids as well, and it's also not clear where you stand on it. For your part in it, some of your language suggests that you're not interested in having kids at all, but the reason you say you explain all frame it as relatively temporary. If your real view is \"I don't want kids\" then it seems disingenuous to just use the temporary issues with your husband to put off further discussion.", "NTA but your husband doesn't have your back here. Make sure your birth control is in order, I recommend an IUD or something that can't be tampered with.", "NTA. She is", "Absolutely, NTA.", "NTA. Stand your ground with your MIL.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's unhinged. If it were me, I would've made up a medical condition and started crying to make her feel bad.", "Someone trying to take ownership of your body? Nothing makes you the asshole for standing up for yourself\n\nNTA", "NTA let her hire a plane to sky write it across the city. It\u2019s not your problem and you don\u2019t owe her anything. You should probably also tell her every time she mentions it to either of you, you\u2019ll put it off for another year.", "NTA - I have two sons.  One is married.  Would I love to have a grand baby?  Sure!  However, my DIL isn't sure she wants kids.  Not my business - not my life, not my body.  I would never (by conscious choice) try to pressure her into having a child she isn't 100% ready to have and raise.", "NTA\n\n61F, CSA survivor. I'm childfree by choice.  I know how easy it is to second guess yourself. The guilt for standing up for yourself will lessen with time, it's always lurking in the shadows.\n\nYou need to have a very serious conversation with your husband regarding boundaries.  He needs to step up.\n\nIf MIL wants another child in her life so badly, there's always foster care and adoption.  So many children looking for caring caregivers.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe anyone a child and she\u2019s gross for her behavior", "NTA. But get in social media and answer her you are not withholding anything, but her threats of forcing you to have a child to appease her when you are not ready and not financially stable show she only cares for herself. You don't exist to give her grandchildren.", "Oh, OP, how I love your backbone. While your husband thanked you for standing up to his AH mother, he needs to be patient with the traumas you've suffered and be more assertive around his mother. You don't mention if you're in therapy, but I hope you are. Clearly NTA.", "Nta. This is a huge red flag. If you and hubby aren't on the same page, get into counseling now. Mil has no right to your body and I am proud of you for standing up to her.", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you for confronting her. Your MIL needs to learn boundaries, and it's important that you and your husband approach this as a team rather than him letting you be the \"bad cop\" that enforces limits with her. IMO both of you need to be on the same page about shutting her down if she brings up this topic again. Also, I suggest you both consider blocking her on FB/all social media as she is not above stirring up drama there.", "NTA. Your husband needs to intervene with this or you\u2019ll have a serious decision to make. You shouldn\u2019t be being pressured by his mother", "NTA, but your comment that your husband \u201cthanked you for standing up to her\u201d concerns me. Does your husband stand up to her about the same issue?\n\nYou said that he wants a family and you have to be the voice of reason that it\u2019s not a good time. Have you two gone to counseling about this issue?", "She doesn\u2019t own your uterus.\nShe\u2019s treating you like a brood mare. \n\nNTA", "NTA but honestly, talk with your Husband. I personally would go low / no contact with her, depending on how she reacts to announcing the reduced Contact etc.", "NTA.\n\n>I overheard her telling him he must have a child in the next two years, or 'he will know what is coming to him'. \n\nI would actually challenge this comment and ask her what she means by this, because this sounds like some sort of threats. \n\nShe is clearly entitled, and your husband needs to set clear boundaries about respecting your choices. You also need to have a conversation with your husband about his own feelings towards being a dad, and his seemingly constant desire to please his mother. \nThis brings the question of your husband caring for his dad, and how much pressure is being put on him to be the perfect son, and guilt trip. Is there a reason why your MIL can't look after her husband (although I get needing a break)? In any case, he may need to speak to someone.\n\nI would also say that if your husband and yourself decided to ever have a child then you should consider going NC or LC, or at least keep her at arms length because she is manipulative and toxic. If she say anything you can simply say that you cannot trust someone that is so horrible to you on social media.", "OP - it is your body , your choice, and only you and your husband can agree if and when you will try for a baby.  Bravo for you to stand up to your overbearing, interfering. rude, and selfish MIL.  She should be ashamed of herself.   I do think you and your OH need to have a frank discussion and to be on the same page, because it seems he succumb to his mother bullying.   And when you do decide to have a baby make sure you set boundary of how often MIL can see the child as l have no doubt she will criticise, belittle, and undermine you at every turn about how to look after a baby.", "NTA\nEesh, I can already imagine all of the boundary stomping that woman will attempt if/when you do decide to have a baby.", "NTA.  Outrageous behaviour by your mother-in-law and you did well to stand up to her.  If you have a baby it must be in your time, no one else's.  Hopefully your husband continues to support you.  I don't know what the law is where you are, but in UK I would be thinking of reporting her to police for harassment.  Her comments on facebook after her comments face-to-face can't be allowed to be repeated.  I wish you wisdom and all the best in dealing with her.", "NAH. Just a couple who are not on the same page regarding one of the fundamentals.", "NTA-- but I have to ask...

It's pathetic", "This is going to be unpopular, but I'm going with ESH, MIL the least.\n\nShe has her preferences and has communicated them privately with her son. She may want the OP to have kids but she confines that hope to private conversations with her son.\n\nThe pressure from the husband came out of his mouth. The words that he speaks are his. If he mouths what his mom wants him to, that is because he is an asshole.\n\nThe OPs rudeness to MIL. 1) anger doesn't justify rudeness. and wasn't really called for. (Accidental eavesdropping is still eavesdropping.) The OP is displacing anger that should be directed at husband to his mom.\n\nAnd, of course, the OP can get pregnant on her schedule,\n\nAnd before I comment on the family internet posters, I'd want to know if they were commenting on the OPs rudeness or on her lack of children.", "[removed]", "NTA, look of course your MIL can't force you to have a kid, obviously. But it does sound like your husband has been clear that HE does want kids so you two need to decide if that's on the table. If you keep stalling eventually this will blow up spectacularly because you want very different things. So get counseling and figure out if you should remain married at all or if you each should be with different people who share you lives intentions.", "NTA. Sounds like you need to go no contact with this toxic person. How overbearing and miserable do you think she would be if you were raising a kid that she had access to? She would undermine all your parenting decisions and stomp on all your boundaries. I guarantee you she'd even call your future child \"her child\" constantly. Yuck. Get some distance from her for your own sanity.", "YTA. Your husband wants kids, just divorce already.", "Right, I think they need to both think through if they want a child or not, and if they do if they want to go through pregnancy or adopt.\n\nBecause it's not something that can be put off forever, and one person just going along with the other can cause major resentment.\n\nEven without the MIL what if the husband increasingly feels like he wants kids over the next 10 years and she doesn't? She could find herself going through a divorce.", " \n\nI am a horrible wife, a horrible daughter-in-law and I am keeping a grandson away from the family.", "AMEN!", "I'm unsure but my husband is waiting until my siblings go to bed before telling me, so I'm a little worried", "I think the issue with going no contact with the mom is that if she is power of attorney, she could restrict and/ or deny access to his father. Even more so since he is in a facility.\n\nWould not surprise me if that is in any update of sorts.", "I actually did this, my mother harrassed me about having kids for years, it took having my tubes tied before she stopped. \n\nOP you are NTA! \n\nYou need to make some boundaries with consequences, and follow through with them. Every time she brings it up, you will not interact with her for x amount of days, and keep adding it up, or just go NC if you are able.\n\nHaving children is a massive endeavor, and should only happen when you are ready\nYour husband needs to have a serious conversation with his mother, putting pressure on you is never going to be helpful.", "I'm unsure on having children for a variety of pros and cons, some I'm still discussing with my husband. He wants a family, and is for the most part understanding, but will slip it in on occasion.", "No, for it's out of our price range, but we will be having a conversation to move forward tonight. It would have given him time to reflect on things I said to him after this happened, and I should have a result soon on how we plan to move forward. \n\nWe do however plan to get counseling in the future, even if it's just to keep our relationship a healthy one", "As someone from the UK, I considered it, but my family plan on moving soon, and I've blocked her on social media already", "What did OP say that was rude?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
