Nephew says it\u2019s not her job to pay the people. Customer says yeah this is why I don\u2019t see this strike working, if you have billionaire actors not willing to take a paycut no one will care.

He starts saying but the customer asked me about my life and that he was just sharing his opinion. I told him if he should have just made up a pleasant story. I told my sister about it and she asked me if I could give him another job, I told her no. I told her he can drive Uber or Doordash or something.

You could have given him more mentoring up front, but I guess that's what the busboy offer was about.", "NTA. You gave him a chance. He messed it up by fighting with a customer over the actors strike (which while looking for better conditions for actors is actually mostly in support of the *writers strike*). If he doesn't have the social grace to know that when a customer at a bar asks about you they mean \"tell me just enough that I feel like I have an in, but not so much that you overshare or it gets creepy\", he wasn't cut out for a bar job. But to then insult a *regular paying customer* because you think a-list actors are hard done by? That's just disconnected from reality. \n\nSounds like his mommy usually cleans up his messes and makes sure he gets the best. Maybe if she hadn't been so insistent on messing with your business and demanding he be a waiter he'd still have a job.", "NTA - Nephew got an opportunity through nepotism. His inadequacy with customers while working is costing him the job. \n\nHe obviously failed to understand that while some customers may want genuine interaction, he is the one on the clock. He isn\u2019t there trading his opinion or stance. \n\nYou gave him a shot. Obviously it was a mistake to put him around customers. If you are really willing to help out AND have the opportunity to, then something without customer interaction may work out. However him without experience nor to quick to be up to speed, nor need for unqualified work out of customer, you can\u2019t be blamed to protect your business. \n\nWhiteout forgetting you are a co-owner. So asking you to impose an unfit worker, is unfair. Your sister and or nephew might be desperate enough to give it a shot asking. That doesn\u2019t make  them a.h, unless they persist after you refuse.", "NTA.  Your nephew failed a key acting job: acting like a professional.\n\nFor some reason I see you and your sister as being De Niro and the politico in Casino having a conversation over rehiring the idiot who got fired for not noticing some slots getting worked over.", "It's bad when you are working as a waiter. No one cares, just do your job and move on. Go on a forum or twitter if you want to get other people to care. It's customer service..", "It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s responsibility to care about things that are important to you.", "NTA - I support the strike and all, but would be so annoyed if Im trying to get a drink and unwind only for my waiter to start talking about this shit.", "NTA. You didn't cause this, he did.", "Nta.  Look, I'm all for striking workers, but ffs, there's a time and place for that.  You are doing the right thing.   I wouldn't sacrifice my own family's well being for an AH kid.", "> Nephew says it\u2019s not her job to pay the people.\n\nWhile correct on principle (her being an actor), he's wrong on this instance.  As one of the producers on Barbie, it is her job.  However she didn't make 60 million as an actor, it was 12.5.  \n\nNTA.  He needs to learn how to be a professional.", "NTA\n\nBusiness and family only works when everyone works and has respect for each other. He didn't respect the position, the customers, or you.", "Lol. Ikr. Nobody asks \u201chow\u2019s things?\u201d wanting the response \u201c The world / my life is a train wreck \u201c.", "NTA. He needed to try acting his age.  His job is not to lecture then insult your customers.", "This might be controversial, but if you\u2019re unqualified for being a server, you\u2019re destined to fail. It\u2019s about as bare min a job as you can have. The fact that he can\u2019t even manage to write down someone wants a burger with fries and someone else wants Buffalo wings with ranch and get it right is\u2026. Something else.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm shocked...someone trying to make it as an actor, but doesn't know how to wait tables?\n\nYour nephew has had it too easy. Waiting tables, bartending, etc is how most wannabe actors pay their bills.\n\nWhat's worse is that he can't even play a role. Any good actor could have played the role of a waiter. Instead your nephew thinks he's a star who gets to be himself all the time.\n\nHe needs to learn how to act.", "He sounds like an entitled brat. And his parents have made him that way. \n\nNTA", "NTA, his attitude has an impact you your business.  Once a place gets a bad rep it sticks.  There are tons of entry level jobs he can take during the strike, not nice jobs but the pay.", "What a fuckin ass. I work in the art dept in film, so this strike is fucking me, but I just turned to Uber. Granted, my car broke down last week so things are looking grim, but there\u2019s always a way. I got a little savings left just in case, but yeah fuck that guy", "NTA", "I'm going to put aside the majority of your nephew's bad behavior and focus on another part:\n\nYour nephew flipped out over the suggesting that **all** greedy rich people deserve a paycut in the name of equality, rather than just some.\n\nThat's a deeply assholish position.", "When people ask how I am, I go with \u2018as well as can be expected\u2019.", "Exactly. I went to the doctor this week. Receptionist say \u201chow are you?\u201d I croaked out good thanks. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA  \n\n\nThe kid was inexperienced. He already was informed of the regulations and rules of the place and how to serve yet he could not do any of that. He mistreated customers and staff members from what I read as well so that is a reason enough on it's own. He wasn't professional so no reason to not fire him.", "NTA. Your regular has a massive misunderstanding of the strike and his proposed solution is stupid, because if you paid Margot Robbie 10M instead of 60, the studios would simply pass that savings up the chain to management and investors. BUT, your nephew was completely out of line and had no business engaging in this kind of conversation with a customer.", "NTA", "You know they didn't. All they took away from this was 'meany uncle who fired his own nephew'.", "Yep. The only exceptions are maybe your best friend, partner, doctor or therapist."]}
