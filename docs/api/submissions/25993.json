Some couples choose alternating holidays, some go to one family for lunch and the other for dinner, and so on. How they manage it is up to them.

My inlaws were set in their ways (\"this is how we do it in our family\" mentality) so when my kids were 2 & 4 and couldn't play with their toys we got them Christmas day because we HAD to go back to my inlaws when we were just there the day before, I had enough and said no.

You signed up as her life partner, spouse, and co-parent... not exhausted long-distance chauffeur. Enough!", "NTA. Traveling and law school are a bad combination", "NTA. It isn't uncommon for new parents to stop traveling for the holidays. You need to be mindful of your overall health and well being. I am sure your school/work is very demanding and that's a lot of driving.", "Our experience was not nearly as arduous as your\u2019s but I can relate. Wife\u2019s family were inflexible on holiday plans. Some of it was for practical reasons but also just because they liked their traditions and saw no reason to change. My family were more flexible and in-laws took advantage. Finally, we\u2019d had enough and told both families, but mostly the in-laws, were were starting our own traditions because they were making the holidays unenjoyable for us. We would see them in January. Amazing how flexible they suddenly became.\n\nETA: NTA", "When I was in law school I had 13 hours between my house and my parent\u2019s house. I went home every Christmas because I got a decent sized break. I went home for Thanksgiving twice. Summer was wherever my internships were. But the key component was that if they wanted to see me outside that? They had to travel to me or pay to fly me out (I was broke).  My sister came out to have thanksgiving with me, my parents flew to NYC to spend a few days with me during an internship. They all visited at least once during the school year.  Her family is expecting a lot and not giving anything whether it\u2019s letting a holiday go, offering to come to you to meet you half way, or helping to pay for flights so you aren\u2019t roving crazy hours. \n\nThat\u2019s what my life is like now that my sister has the grandkids and I have none. So I had to do what you did - say no. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect someone to travel across the country repeatedly over the year and give up all of their down time.  Problem is I don\u2019t have to run that choice by anyone - you have to get your wife on your side and it might not happen this year if she has never really considered the idea that the onus to visit shouldn\u2019t all be on her and that it\u2019s ok to not be at Thanksgiving.\n\nNTA", "NTA but it is a slippery slope.  Also, if she wants to go alone, you should let her.  and yes, you will be taking care of the kid alone.", "NTA\n\nWe do a rotation:\nHis family, my family, our place.\n\nFamily is welcome to come to our place when it is there.\n\nYou should add \u201cat home\u201d to your rotation.", "26 hours of driving?! Is flying a possibility?", "NTA it\u2019s hard to break old family traditions and make new ones but it has to be done. Especially with you still being in school and having a toddler, it\u2019s just too much. My husband was in night law school & working full time when we had twin toddlers so I know the pain. \n\nMy MIL has a Christmas birthday and for years we tried to make it work seeing both families on the day. Did ok when we only had a 3 hour drive there and back but when we moved to a 12 hour drive, I put my foot down. It helped when the very last time my ILs drove to our new place my MIL declared the drive was way too long and she\u2019d never do it again. But of course it was fine for the people with jobs and school to make that drive and use up all our precious time off. I was not happy and gave my husband an earful about that. \n\nNow Christmas is our nuclear family, my ILs get Thanksgiving and part of spring break while my parents get the time after Christmas & our kids\u2019 birthday; people can come see us any other time they want. But no one but my parents do because it\u2019s too hard for them to travel to where we are. And then they complain about not seeing us much. Whatever, not my problem, we have limited vacation time and I\u2019m not spending it traveling to places we been a 1,000 times before when no one will return the favor.", "NTA.  I would talk to her about it and maybe suggest you host Easter or a different holiday at your place so family can come your way too", "NTA.  Mother of a young attorney here.  Finals usually fall shortly after Thanksgiving.  You can't waste all that potential study time driving all over the place.  Grades and class rank matter in law school for clerkships and employment. Your wife and family need to understand that. It is wonderful that you got an internship with an attorney's office.  If it was with big law, then extra congrats on getting that as a 1L. If it wasn't big law, you need to explain to her what a clerkship with one of those firms pay as it could be a big financial boost to your family not to mention it is more likely you will get an offer in big law.  For those unfamiliar, those summer clerkships pay big bucks!\n\nWe brought my son a plate of food the Thanksgiving of his first year.  He didn't come home for Thanksgiving or Christmas his second year due to finals and a paper that was due on 12/31. Did we miss him, absolutely!

Law school and medical school are absolute beatings.\n\nGood Luck OP!", "i mean since most of the driving/traveling this year benefited you, and she missed her family\u2019s events for yours, i can see why she wants to go so bad, slight YTA\n\nwatch me get downvoted to absolute hell LOL", "NTA that\u2019s way too much travel in a year especially with a young child! I understand your wife feels obligated because all her family will be there and she isn\u2019t but the same can be said when you do the holiday with your family.

Or do a video call for the holidays.\n\nI was always the one traveling to family events when my daughter was small and eventually we just said enough. We were spending almost our whole holiday in the car. It wasn\u2019t relaxing or fun at all with a little kid. It was so nice to just to stuff with our own household and not go anywhere for our limited time off.", "It can be really hard to stop going \u201chome\u201d for the holidays on both sides. The family expects you there. And also, sometimes, if you\u2019ve always had holidays with parents/extended family, the first couple holidays in your own home can feel lonely and hollow. But you will eventually build your own warm traditions. \n\nAs a kid, I strongly preferred holidays in our own house to those at my grandparents\u2019 though I enjoyed visiting extended family after the holiday. (I didn\u2019t mind the long car rides, and neither do my kids now. We make the drives fun and special with inexpensive little treats, games, snacks, movies, books.) My kids also prefer our cozy family holiday celebrations at home/just us/with our own traditions, though they love seeing grandparents/cousins/aunts and uncles at other times of the year. \n\nBut those first couple of years\u2014building our own traditions\u2014were very hard.

And point out that it is not right towards your child to put him through those drives more than necessary. \n\nI see that this is hard for your wife, but at the same time it is important part of growing up, to set boundaries towards your parents and start put your partner and children/nuclear family first. Even if the guilt mostly comes from your own mind.\n\nMaybe you should discuss what traditions you wish for your children to remember and establish while growing up? Is it spending days in a car? Or maybe visiting some theme park before the holidays, or make homemade candy, food or decorations?
