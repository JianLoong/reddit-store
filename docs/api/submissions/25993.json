Wife\u2019s family were inflexible on holiday plans. Some of it was for practical reasons but also just because they liked their traditions and saw no reason to change. My family were more flexible and in-laws took advantage. Finally, we\u2019d had enough and told both families, but mostly the in-laws, were were starting our own traditions because they were making the holidays unenjoyable for us. We would see them in January. Amazing how flexible they suddenly became.\n\nETA: NTA", "When I was in law school I had 13 hours between my house and my parent\u2019s house. I went home every Christmas because I got a decent sized break. I went home for Thanksgiving twice. Summer was wherever my internships were. But the key component was that if they wanted to see me outside that? They had to travel to me or pay to fly me out (I was broke).  My sister came out to have thanksgiving with me, my parents flew to NYC to spend a few days with me during an internship. They all visited at least once during the school year.  Her family is expecting a lot and not giving anything whether it\u2019s letting a holiday go, offering to come to you to meet you half way, or helping to pay for flights so you aren\u2019t roving crazy hours. \n\nThat\u2019s what my life is like now that my sister has the grandkids and I have none. So I had to do what you did - say no. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect someone to travel across the country repeatedly over the year and give up all of their down time.  Problem is I don\u2019t have to run that choice by anyone - you have to get your wife on your side and it might not happen this year if she has never really considered the idea that the onus to visit shouldn\u2019t all be on her and that it\u2019s ok to not be at Thanksgiving.\n\nNTA", "NTA but it is a slippery slope.

Is flying a possibility?", "NTA it\u2019s hard to break old family traditions and make new ones but it has to be done. Especially with you still being in school and having a toddler, it\u2019s just too much. My husband was in night law school & working full time when we had twin toddlers so I know the pain. \n\nMy MIL has a Christmas birthday and for years we tried to make it work seeing both families on the day. Did ok when we only had a 3 hour drive there and back but when we moved to a 12 hour drive, I put my foot down. It helped when the very last time my ILs drove to our new place my MIL declared the drive was way too long and she\u2019d never do it again. But of course it was fine for the people with jobs and school to make that drive and use up all our precious time off. I was not happy and gave my husband an earful about that. \n\nNow Christmas is our nuclear family, my ILs get Thanksgiving and part of spring break while my parents get the time after Christmas & our kids\u2019 birthday; people can come see us any other time they want. But no one but my parents do because it\u2019s too hard for them to travel to where we are. And then they complain about not seeing us much.

Finals usually fall shortly after Thanksgiving.  You can't waste all that potential study time driving all over the place.  Grades and class rank matter in law school for clerkships and employment. Your wife and family need to understand that. It is wonderful that you got an internship with an attorney's office.  If it was with big law, then extra congrats on getting that as a 1L. If it wasn't big law, you need to explain to her what a clerkship with one of those firms pay as it could be a big financial boost to your family not to mention it is more likely you will get an offer in big law.

We used to feel immense obligation to go back home for the holidays and other occasions MANY times a year. It started wearing on me right away because I have *extreme* value differences with nearly her whole family, and my parents aren't exactly a restful visit either.\n\nI was the one who got burned out first (*definitely* by year 4 of the marriage), and I started pretty loudly advocating against going back. As I saw it, it was a LOT of travel and expense for people who were pretty unappreciative of the effort and who liked to manipulate us in order to dominate our time. I brought it up with my wife back then and was surprised to find out that she felt the same way about the quality and burden of the trips, but she's much more susceptible to the guilt trips, so we maintained the status quo for a couple more years until I finally just said I couldn't and put my foot down.\n\nMy wife finally came around to my perspective after several more trips (both with and without me), all of which were just more and more drama, stress, and disrespect. We'd get to the end of the year with way less money than we hoped, to a large extent because we'd spend a minimum of $2,000 annually on plane tickets/gas/car rentals/groceries for holiday feasts/constant gifts/dog boarding/ etc. etc. And it's not like our relationships with our family were getting any stronger because of it.\n\nThese days I go back *maybe* once a year, and she might go back once without me. That works for us. But it took a long time and a lot of confrontation to get here, and I would by lying if I said it didn't take a considerable toll on our marriage.\n\nMy advice: bring it up with your wife and have that conversation in a firm but respectful way, and start developing boundaries at least for yourself. Spend some time thinking about your specific concerns and go through them with her in detail. Nail down what these trips cost you (in monetary and non-monetary terms, like time and stress, focus away from your home and your family for significant periods of time, etc.). \n\nOdds are pretty decent she won't see it your way at first, which is unfortunate, but eventually the grind will get to her. If you've already developed the issues, and if she sees you maintaining boundaries in this area, it's going to be a lot easier for her to come around.\n\nFour days driving with a toddler is a LOT, and doing it for a one-day thanksgiving visit, when everyone's attention is going to be divided among an entire extended family (and getting the meal together, etc.), is kind of laughable. That's not what quality time looks like.\n\nSee if you can get her to commit to doing Christmas at home this year, or at least next year. After a taste of that, I can bet your wife will have a whole different view of the time the two of you have been giving away.

Classes are generally only 2 days a week instead of 3, giving you time to work or do internships. 2L year is definitely not the hardest, and 3L is a total waste of time, I had taken all of my required classes by then, so I took random seminars and classes on niche areas of the law, and got by doing outlines.\n\nWhat law school is really brutal on though is relationships. I knew many people who entered law school in a relationship. Most ended by the end of the first year.

We had generally four days a week of regular classes and then our legal writing class in the morning Fridays, so five days total. It was just brutal. With each class (other than legal writing) occurring two days a week there was barely enough time to actually get everything done, and often it was just literally impossible because there weren't enough hours in the day for that sheer amount of reading required. Eventually I just learned that I would have to skip certain things (learning questions, dissents) because there just wasn't enough time, and I would have to roll the dice that I wouldn't be cold called about the dissent in whatever case. It wasn't laziness, there just literally wasn't time to read every page. \n\nI remember one guy in my 1L group was given a reading assignment over winter break by his legal writing prof! (Our total group met for most classes but the legal writing classes were broken into a bunch of subgroups.) They had to basically just read any book and do a book report on it, like they were in grade school. He was just so exhausted and fed up that he read Cat in the Hat and did his report on it. Amazingly, he was given a passing grade. \n\nI still feel bad about the fact that I missed my grandmother's wake, but it just wasn't possible to be there. She had died earlier in the year (when I was still in 1L) and I think the thought was it would be held over the summer, but my uncle's kids (my cousins, all adults by then) couldn't do it because of this or that, including their own schooling things (arguing a Master's thesis, etc.). I understood but it was so frustrating when they scheduled it for the first week of my 2L classes and I had to tell them there was just no way I could do it, and he sent me an email basically begging me to go and explaining that they couldn't do it earlier because of his kids' engagements. I had to basically tell him that law school was just as arduous as what they were doing if not more, and missing the first week would absolutely ruin the rest of my semester, so it just wasn't possible at all. I was left alone about it after that but I felt both terrible about missing it and angry that I was put in the position of being the \"bad guy\" because I wasn't consulted about my schedule before the decision was made and it was just assumed that the early part of a law school semester wasn't such a big deal. \n\nThankfully, 2L and 3L did get a little better since we could manage our own schedules more. I also didn't do a Journal Article so that helped (I'm doing fine without having done it, though granted Big Law was never my career path.) It was also in that period that it became Zoom School of Law, which made it a huge waste of time but also helpful in a way, because it was like everyone kind of gave up at the same time, and the expectations weren't as high. The first semester of that (which had started in person) converted to pass/fail which took a lot of the pressure off. I was also lucky in that my GF (now wife) was in law school herself through part of the time I was there so we could commiserate, and she understood what I was going through. But yeah, I don't know how I would have managed a relationship otherwise (though conversely, I don't know how I would have managed without the one I already had). Certainly dating and finding a new partner would have been completely out of the question. There'd be no time to go on dates!\n\nThere were a handful of people I met in law school who had kids but as far as I know most of them were doing night school where it took four years instead of three. It's just genuinely not possible to do everything in law school and maintain a parenting relationship like that, or at least it wouldn't have been in my program. Just an absolutely insane schedule they want you to keep during that time. \n\nI almost quit myself a few times. If my wife had asked me to take multiple long trips to another state to see family I would have had a mental breakdown. (By the way, sorry this got longer than I intended it to lol.)", "One year when i was almost done wth grad school i stayed home alone for Christmas in my tiny apartment. My Christmas tree was a few branches I'd gotten for free from the Christmas tree lot, stuck in the bucket I usually kept under the sink to catch the drips from the leaky plumbing. I made pasta wth broiled scallops as a treat and only set off the smoke alarm twice. After the second time my Korean landlady from downstairs realized I was home, I guess, and came up with a bottle of very fruity wine  and a plastic plate of some sort of spongy cookie-cakes.

Yeah, in 1L our schedules were totally made for us but after that I tried to avoid morning classes too, aside from a couple electives later that I was interested in enough to sacrifice for.

Got my best grade ever in that class!)", "Heh, we didn't have anything like that, but I took a class on the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.

It came to me and I said, \"Because it's my final semester, I need the credits to graduate, and it fits in my schedule.\" The professor chuckled, said ,\"we have one of your every semester, and I appreciate your honesty.\" He never once called on me in class, and gave me an easy A.", "NTA Aside from all the valid law school implications, 26 hours with a toddler for Thanksgiving?
