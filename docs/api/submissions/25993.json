Wife\u2019s family were inflexible on holiday plans. Some of it was for practical reasons but also just because they liked their traditions and saw no reason to change. My family were more flexible and in-laws took advantage. Finally, we\u2019d had enough and told both families, but mostly the in-laws, were were starting our own traditions because they were making the holidays unenjoyable for us. We would see them in January. Amazing how flexible they suddenly became.\n\nETA: NTA", "When I was in law school I had 13 hours between my house and my parent\u2019s house. I went home every Christmas because I got a decent sized break. I went home for Thanksgiving twice. Summer was wherever my internships were. But the key component was that if they wanted to see me outside that? They had to travel to me or pay to fly me out (I was broke).  My sister came out to have thanksgiving with me, my parents flew to NYC to spend a few days with me during an internship. They all visited at least once during the school year.  Her family is expecting a lot and not giving anything whether it\u2019s letting a holiday go, offering to come to you to meet you half way, or helping to pay for flights so you aren\u2019t roving crazy hours. \n\nThat\u2019s what my life is like now that my sister has the grandkids and I have none. So I had to do what you did - say no. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect someone to travel across the country repeatedly over the year and give up all of their down time.  Problem is I don\u2019t have to run that choice by anyone - you have to get your wife on your side and it might not happen this year if she has never really considered the idea that the onus to visit shouldn\u2019t all be on her and that it\u2019s ok to not be at Thanksgiving.\n\nNTA", "NTA but it is a slippery slope.

Is flying a possibility?", "NTA it\u2019s hard to break old family traditions and make new ones but it has to be done. Especially with you still being in school and having a toddler, it\u2019s just too much. My husband was in night law school & working full time when we had twin toddlers so I know the pain. \n\nMy MIL has a Christmas birthday and for years we tried to make it work seeing both families on the day. Did ok when we only had a 3 hour drive there and back but when we moved to a 12 hour drive, I put my foot down. It helped when the very last time my ILs drove to our new place my MIL declared the drive was way too long and she\u2019d never do it again. But of course it was fine for the people with jobs and school to make that drive and use up all our precious time off. I was not happy and gave my husband an earful about that. \n\nNow Christmas is our nuclear family, my ILs get Thanksgiving and part of spring break while my parents get the time after Christmas & our kids\u2019 birthday; people can come see us any other time they want. But no one but my parents do because it\u2019s too hard for them to travel to where we are. And then they complain about not seeing us much.

Finals usually fall shortly after Thanksgiving.  You can't waste all that potential study time driving all over the place.  Grades and class rank matter in law school for clerkships and employment. Your wife and family need to understand that. It is wonderful that you got an internship with an attorney's office.  If it was with big law, then extra congrats on getting that as a 1L. If it wasn't big law, you need to explain to her what a clerkship with one of those firms pay as it could be a big financial boost to your family not to mention it is more likely you will get an offer in big law.

However, if you attempted to prevent her from traveling, that'd be different.\n\nYour toddler will be fine one way or another. \n\nAlso: Have you considered flying instead of driving? It's safer! Especially during big holidays.", "NAH,\n\nYour wife is not an asshole for want to spend time with her family during the holidays and your not TA for wanting to stop doing that. But... and here is the big but...if you demand you stop then you better not dump on her the responsibility of bringing in the holidays. Guys tend to underestimate how exhausting holiday prep is. If you are going to push this then you have to be a real partner in making the holidays just as special as they are at your families houses. I don't know if you are ready for how much work that actually is. Be prepared that with all the cooking, decorating it might actually be more work. Also be prepared to hear your wife say no, that she doesn't want to do all that work and finds the traveling to be easier.", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to spend the holidays at home.", "Info: no flights or trains where you need to go to?", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to not want to have to travel so much for all these events. You could even invite your relatives to visit you instead.", "NTA.  You are being totally reasonable.   While I understand her love for tradition, when it doesn't make sense, you don't do it.", "I would say NAH. You visited both families a number of times, there is nothing wrong with celebrating at home with your wife and toddler. If you said visit yours and not hers that would be a different story. But I think you are right that is a lot of travelling especially with a toddler. I hope you and your wife can come to an agreement and just spend the holidays celebrating together. You BOTH should be happy for the holidays too. It's not about just you or just her it's about BOTH you and her. And your child too, of course!", "When my twins were young (they\u2019re 23 years old now), we had to go to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners at minimum 5 family members homes because we (husband and I) are both from divorced parents. Finally when our sons were around 2-3 years old, I told my husband I can\u2019t do this every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas, it makes it hard to enjoy the holidays. So we went to thanksgiving we stayed home and cooked then Christmas Eve was his family and Christmas Day was my family. That made it a little easier to make plans and not stress us out. Over the years, we quit going to both sides for Christmas. It\u2019s just to stressful for what\u2019s supposed to be a happy time!", "NTA just so long as it's not missing one family only, but just 'honey let's stay home' it's fine.\n\nthere's been a lot of driving and you need to just destress. driving at those two holidays will be even worse.  It's ok to just sit down at home and say 'enough'", "Why put a 2 year old through that? It\u2019s not like you two haven\u2019t extended yourselves trying to attend anything. Your wife is being unreasonable.NTA", "We have not lived nearer then a 6hr drive to our  families since our eldest was born. Luckily both our families are close to each other (1hr apart) we try to get \u2018home\u2019 for Christmas every second year but now we live literally on the opposite side of the world it\u2019s more like every 3rd year. Our parents attempt to visit once every 1/2yrs (it was more often when we were in the same country) \n\nIt\u2019s okay to prioritize your own family Unit & say no. Why doesn\u2019t anyone ever travel to you?", "NTA. That\u2019s an unreasonable amount of driving for a law student. You should be studying for finals that weekend, not driving across the country.\n\nHer family can pay for plane tickets for her and the baby. You can stay home.", "NTA - do your thing - keep your eye on the long game so that you don\u2019t exhaust yourself in the short game.", "NTA for asking. You would be if you turned it into an ultimatum or treated this as a final decision without her say, but just giving your honest feelings doesn\u2019t make you the AH. However, if she wants to go visit family on her own that\u2019s totally her right. If she can\u2019t travel alone/with a toddler or doesn\u2019t want to, try to discuss what you could do to make up for the missed occasions. Maybe saving up for a vacation rental that allows you and your families to meet in the middle. I know that money can be tight when you\u2019re a student, but consider taking a train or other form of transportation so you don\u2019t have to drive and potentially have time to study or relax. If your wife insists on seeing family, listen when she says why it\u2019s important to her. The most important thing in a relationship is that both people are getting their needs met, and it\u2019s up to the two of you to communicate your wants and needs in this situation.\n\nTl;dr: OP is NTA for asking and there\u2019s a lot of ways for them to work this out", "NTA. Stay home. If you wanted you could invite them to come to you. Many families do not celebrate the holiday on the actual holiday date. Pick a different time to get together when life isnt so hectic like the holidays", "My sister and her husband invited me to drive five hours to visit her FIL and his family, who we were all neighbors with during childhood so I knew them well, during Thanksgiving my first year of law school.  \n\nMy going was a big mistake.  I should have stayed in town and studied.  \n\nI would never dream of doing that as a 2L.  NTA", "FWIW when I was in law school pretty recently it was generally understood that 1L was really the worst year (it was for me at least). But yeah, law school in general isn't really something you can mess around with as far as this much travel. I'm honestly a little surprised they opted to have a small child so close to him starting school, but from my own experience I can understand if law school was perhaps a \"career change\" decision that came later. \n\nAnd never mind the Bar exam, woof. Had to take it twice and there really was not much time for anything. I would have had to take it more times if I'd been doing this much traveling and family functions. Not possible. \n\nYeah I think OP is NTA for setting a limit, especially given the other demands on his time. It may also be fine if his wife and child travel to some things without him so he can study and do what he needs to do.", "NTA.", "I think Christmas is spent at your own house once you have children.", "Bless you for being the law school mama we all deserved back then!", "Agree.", "I got roped into Thanksgiving my 1L year, too. My in-laws are divorced so actual Thanksgiving was with my FIL\u2019s extended family and my MIL insisted on doing \u201cher\u201d Thanksgiving late Saturday night. Oh and she invited us up Tuesday.\n\nSo I was stuck from Tuesday through Sunday.", "I was in a separate room for 1L exams. I have such regrets.\n\nI heard stories about people basically running out of exam rooms never to be seen from again.\n\nBut I agree, its time to start having conversations about how much travel is reasonable. Especially before OP starts a job where this just won't be an option and they'll likely have to celebrate holidays at home.", "I loved creating my own traditions! I chose to keep the ones I liked and skipping others. I especially enjoyed getting out of the in-laws ways since they didn't manage to keep a schedule OR respect us enough to tell us they changed things last minute (my husband has diabetes and we have young children, we _need_ to know when food will be served). This will be our sixth Christmas without any other relatives since we became parents and I just love it. We have our own family routine and it's absolutely the best!", "It\u2019s valid for anybody to do this, whether part of a couple, and with or without kids.  Friends may be \u201cfamily\u201d as well, or someone might miss their bio family and just not have the money or energy to make it back.  People should be able to enjoy their holiday without feeling guilty.", "Idk maybe wife is scared of flying so we can\u2019t assume but imo it would be much less stressful and convenient", "26 hrs of driving **with a toddler** to spend a single day with family?!\n\nFuck that noise. I don't love anyone enough to endure that. No one.\n\nPlanes exist.  Flying during Thanksgiving is not that big of a deal, I do it every year because I'm not wasting my life stuck in a car for 12hrs each way.\n\nBut you have a child.  You 3 are a family. Your wife is not going to be alone, she's going to be with her family. Just not her *family of origin.*\n\nShe needs to start accepting that.", "She\u2019s unreasonable. That\u2019s far too much studying time!", "That\u2019s not possible. She\u2019s being completely unreasonable.", "Well she\u2019s objectively ridiculous and a total AH to you and your daughter.", "I'm saying just for Christmas. They keep going to every family event and it's a lot of driving. So they're alternating Christmas and Thanksgiving each year but considering how close those two things are, that's a lot of driving. Add in the reunions, it's another two. Then that brothers thing etc. \n\nThey really don't seem to have a lot of time to themselves.", "Absolutely!", "Ditto. I'm quite against flying, but a 26 hours round trip you have to make once every two years? Even without a young child the idea would make me ill.\n\nEdit: A few comments down below OP mentions wife finds flying to be stressfull. I can't be empathetic with her - surely flying cannot be more stressfull than travelling four days for an event that lasts a day. From what I understand US citizens don't have that many PTO days either - does she want to sacrifice that much PTO time? I don't think OP should sacrifice that much time off studying.", "I want to know this too. 26 hours of driving is a LOT of gas money, plus the 2 overnight stops where they\u2019d be paying for hotel.", "What you do is find other law students who can\u2019t/choose not to go home for Thanksgiving and have a Friendsgiving potluck.  If it\u2019s about not being alone, that is.", "> She also is extremely worried we'll be alone on that day and it'll make her sad.\n\nYou won't be alone. You'll have each other, you'll call your families.\n\nBut if she's worried about it, try asking around now if you have friends who might like to drop by for the holiday. Lots of people have no extended family and so they spend it with friends. Or ask some of the family to visit!", "You\u2019re not fucking alone if you are together. Ugh.", "Depends on where the airport is. Most of the time when I'm visiting my parents it's a 2-3 hour flight. But outside of holiday season the trip can become as much as 8 hours when there's no dedicated flight between those two points and I'm forced to rely on a bunch of layovers until I'm dumped at the right airport. Plus then it's a two hour drive to pick me up and drop me off, and sometimes that has to happen at like 6am or 11pm. And it's not even a very rural airport, I imagine trying to touch down in Nebraska or something would be an even bigger pain in the ass year round.", "YES! This is what I did since 2L year, and we\u2019ve had Thanksgiving with those same two friends almost every year since.", "How is that comparable to a 20+ hour roundtrip drive? Beyond that, it's such a niche, perfect storm of conditions as to not even be worth mentioning."]}
