Have you tried just telling your wife that you're beat? Something like:\n\n*\"Babe, second year is the \"grunt year\" in law school, and the workload is going to be even more brutal. I'm telling you up front, I can't face any more long family trips this year. I'd love it if we just stayed home and made our own traditions, but you can do what you think is best. Either way,* ***I'm going to be staying home for Thanksgiving and Christmas***. *If you wanna take Junior to see your family, that's cool, maybe they'll send you plane tickets. Or you can leave him with me. You can even invite your folks to start coming here to visit. We've got lots of options, but I'm not travelling.\"*\n\nNTA for recognizing when you've hit your limit, OP.

This is a LONG ROAD.", "Once a couple starts a family of their own, **they are allowed to start their own family traditions if they want.**\n\nFamilies who all live near each other, and get on well, often choose to continue the big family celebrations like they always have. It does get a bit tricky for the couple now that there are at least two families in the mix, and often even more once you factor in divorced parents and step-families and the rest. Some couples choose alternating holidays, some go to one family for lunch and the other for dinner, and so on. How they manage it is up to them. If everyone is happy with whatever arrangement is decided on, great.\n\nBut for some reason, many people get really uncomfortable with the idea of saying to their parents, \"No, we won't be able to come for Christmas / Thanksgiving / New Year / whatever this year. We've decided to celebrate it at home with our own kids\".\n\nMy point is, you're allowed to. It may be awkward, you may get a bit of backlash, but **you're allowed to.** It's perfectly reasonable to do so. It's especially reasonable in your case, because your families live so far away from you and you've done so much traveling already this year.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

I can't even get into the headspace.", "NTA - This is a 100% reasonable ask.", "NTA.\n\nBut be prepared for push back given that most of the travelling so far this year has benefitted you. I.e. your internship, your grandpas wedding. \n\nGiven that she\u2019s missed family events, chances are, your wife will feel more obligated to attend thanksgiving.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve done so much driving around already.  Your wife from comments I see refuses to fly, and would rather spend days in the car for ONE day, thanksgiving, in the middle of it.  It\u2019s not worth it.  Tell her she either goes alone this time, you all fly and she gets over that, or you host.", "NTA. \n\nI got tired of going all over the dang place for Thanksgivings and Christmases. My Mom would always have Thanksgiving and Christmas on different days, she'd call all of us (4 kids plus spouses and kids) and find a date that works for us all, usually 3 or 4 days before or after the holiday to accommodate everyone. My inlaws were set in their ways (\"this is how we do it in our family\" mentality) so when my kids were 2 & 4 and couldn't play with their toys we got them Christmas day because we HAD to go back to my inlaws when we were just there the day before, I had enough and said no. I started a new tradition. Christmas day we are home, we are not leaving or going anywhere and we won't be having any visitors. Just the 4 of us. Mil and her mother complained and whined, but my fil just told them hush because mil used to complain about the same thing. Lol. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with starting new traditions. People sometimes forget that when you get married and have kids, they are your immediate family, and your parents and  siblings become your extended family.", "\ud83d\udcaf this! \n\nMy friend's family does one Christmas with her family, his family gets the next, and then their family (3 of them) stay home and do their own Christmas. No one messes up or demands or gets a say or changes the year they rotate. Same order schedule rotation so you know if you got them this year, you won't see them again until 3 years later for Christmas. It allows my friend and her partner to plan better, save up money, not stress with the disappointment and guilting that goes on etc.", "Yep. My brother when his first kid was born announced that Christmas Eve/Morning was always going to be at his house. They\u2019d travel to see people before, or after, but they were not playing the Christmas musical chairs game between families.", "That\u2019s probably a better compromise, just stay home. If They spent the holidays with his family last year. She\u2019s going to want to spent it with her  family this year. It doesn\u2019t matter how much driving there was involved this year. She\u2019s probably going to feel it\u2019s unfair to her and her family. So they easiest way to make it fair is this year the family stays home", "She wants to chop the drive up so we drive 6 1/2 hours one day, stop, 6 1/2 hours the next, arrive, spend thanksgiving day with her family, then the next day drive 6 1/2 hours, stop, then drive 6 1/2 hours home.", "I think what I'm going to do is tell her I can't make the trip and if she feels she needs to go she can go without me. She feels enormous pressure to go because ALL of her family will be there, except us if we dont go. So she really feels we need to do it, but I don't think I have the mental fortitude to make the trip, and I don't want to make my son make the trip either.", "I agree 100% that we are the assholes for dragging our kid around. He's been such a trooper I've been so proud of him. Granted, he's been able to see his grandparents, uncles, and aunts that he's rarely been around. But you're not wrong that we need to travel less.", "I'be suggested flying, but she finds flying more stressful than driving. This summer we needed our car so I could make the commute to the internship and so she wasn't stuck in the apartment the whole summer.", "I would love to host people! We just live very far from all of our family. Our closest family members are her parents, they only live 6 hours away. We would have gone to their house no problem for Thanksgiving, but now they've moved it and quadroupled our driving time.", "I never thought of that, but I think that would be very sad for both of us.", "I have, she wants to break the drive up inti 2 days of driving 6 1/2 hours, one day of Thanksgiving, and then another two days of 6 1/2 hours of driving home. I think we've done enough driving this year and should just spend the holidays together.", "We have. I've suggested flying but she considers a 6 hour round trip flight more stressful than a 26 hour round trip car drive. She wants to chop up the days driving so we drive 6 hours a day until we get there, spend Thanksgiving day with her fsmily, and then drive 6 hours a day until we get home. That's how we did the 22 hour drive and it was still exhausting.", "It's incredibly weird even in the US. 99.9% of people would take a flight instead of drive that far for that long.", "What you described is what they were already doing?", "Lordy, in what universe is that a \"restful holiday\"? \n\nFour days of driving for one (1) day of socializing? Can she not see how unbalanced that is?", "I\u2019d tell her if she wants to see her family you guys are flying. A 26 hour round trip with a toddler sounds awful, plus with gas prices, hotel stops, and the miles you\u2019d add to your car it\u2019s probably comparable in price", "So strange\u2026 my youngest is 12 months now, and we\u2019ve flown 7 times already, flights 1 to 6 hours. And we went to one cabin trip, 3 hrs car ride each way. Even the 6 hrs flight was a walk in the park compared to the car ride, my son just hates being strapped to the car seat any longer than 15 minutes. Can\u2019t imagine 26 hours in the car\u2026. But yours might be used to it. \nFor us, busses and trains and planes work so much better. He gets to play, to crawl around, to look at the planes, some stimuli compared to just sitting in the car seat\u2026\n\nNTA.", "Yeah, I see you commented what your trip would look like. Seems hellish and a lot of effort for just seeing someone for one day.\n\nIt's time that people come to you, especially when you've got a lot going on already and you've got a toddler.\n\nSuggest it for this year (if it's not too late) and definitely suggest it for future Christmases and Thanksgivings.", "Can you swap families for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, or is their Christmas gathering also that far away?", "When those kind of distances come in to play, it can become a necessity.  My wife and I are both foreigners in the country we live in, and there are continental divides at play.  Trying to get both people everywhere all the time is simply not doable, and it seems you are now in a similar situation.  Have a talk about it", "It sounds exausting, indeed. I think NTA and you really should ask a break from all that driving around.", "I think OP is just alternating between her family and his, not also having a year for just themselves.", "From what I understand, she believes she has an obligation to make it. I think the best advice I got here is to suggest she go to make that obligation, and tell her I can't do it. Her family may think bad of me but I just can't fathom doing another trip like that this year. She also is extremely worried we'll be alone on that day and it'll make her sad.", "Ahh, you\u2019re right. Thanks!", "Um...if all three of you are together on a special day, *you're not alone.* You are with the family you created together. If that makes her \"sad\" then perhaps a little family counselling would be helpful to get to the root cause.\n\nEverything I'm reading here makes me think that it's high time you made new rules, OP. You signed up as her life partner, spouse, and co-parent... not exhausted long-distance chauffeur. Enough!"]}
