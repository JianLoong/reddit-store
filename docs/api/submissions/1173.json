Your friend offered to take you to their house so you didn't sit out in the cold, it's not like you begged them and forced them to. Going to a great high school does not mean it's okay for you to sit in cold weather for 4 hours.", "NTA\n\nExpecting you to wait 4hrs is ridiculous, in my opinion. \n\nHowever can you not make your own way home or sit in the library and catch up on any homework?", "WTF. NTA at all. Accepting help from a friend offering it is not selfish at all. And sitting outside for hours in the cold is not ok.", "NTA. Theres no shame in accepting help that someone offers you. Though I think your parents are angry because they think this situation embarrasses *them* - they're worried about how they look to the family of the friend you went home with and potentially being judged for not being able to pick up their kid on time. I'm not agreeing with them, but I've known people who get very defensive about minor things like this, especially having to do with their children. \n\nBut it's no excuse. You're right that it's completely unreasonable to have you wait outside doing nothing for hours when you have another perfectly safe option available to you.", "Nta at all. Talk to someone at the school and tell them about everything and maybe they can help you", "NTA and I'd tell your parents that I'm sure Child Services would love to hear that they want you to stand outside in the cold for 4 hours without proper warm clothing.", "How is this even a question? NTA. I'm a grown ass adult and I'm not used to anything like that, nor should anyone be. Sitting outside without a jacket in 45 degree weather for hours is how you get hypothermia.  Like. I don't understand how getting somewhere warm is *selfish* - it's a damn requirement to sustaining life.", "NTA\n\nI think your parents are upset because this situation embarrasses them. In the future, maybe you should stay in library to do hw or join a club/sport to pass time if going to others people\u2019s houses is a problem for your parents.", "i live 45 minutes away, and my city is kinda dangerous and i am a pretty petite woman"]}
