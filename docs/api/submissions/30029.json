But if I'm being honest, Ava and I haven't always had the best relationship, because of how demanding, aggressive, and mean she can be.\n\nRegardless I always tried to keep the peace both as a child and even now as an adult. She's done a lot for me so I didn't want to be ungrateful. When she did something wrong, Dad often told me that it was just \"how she is\" but I never truly got used to her. My bio mom, while she couldn't do much for me financially, is the opposite of Ava, so it was hard to accept Ava because my own mom never stressed me out like that.\n\nA while back, my fiance and I went back to our hometown. We usually stay with my parents or hers. While we were with my parents, I asked Ava how the venue was going. She aggressively asked if we changed the date yet. The date we chose is the day after her birthday and she likes to travel during that time. \n\nI said no and explained that it was the tentative date we had for now. She angrily stormed off. Not a surprise. It was always her way or the highway, but I felt like just this once, they would make an exception for my wedding. When she came back, she immediately started telling us how \"disrespectful\" we were for choosing that date and not changing it. Before I could speak, she screamed, (with profanities) at us to get out of her house.\n\nWe felt humiliated, getting berated by her whilst packing. A few days later, my fiance wrote a discrete FB post about the situation, sharing her thoughts from the experience. I didn't really want her sharing it on FB but I felt guilty putting her through that. She was never comfortable around Ava and she always said this but I kept reassuring her that everything was okay. My mistake. She always tried to be chill but has always hated my family's dynamic of just sweeping Ava's behavior under the rug. \n\nI got a call from Dad shortly after because the post got attention.

The action I took that should be judged is choosing the wedding date knowing that my parents and brother travel each year for my step mom's birthday. I'm aware that they do. I just wish they could have made the exception for my big day because we really wanted that date. It was just the most convenient for us, the bridal/groom parties and what we wanted.\n\n2. Well, my dad accused me of purposefully choosing that date to exclude my step mom. This isn't true and I let him know that but it got me thinking: Do they really see it that way?

She's the one who overreacted and tried to bully you and your fianc\u00e9. \n\nBut I also don't understand the insistence on that date on your part. Since it's a tentative date & venue was not booked yet, would it have made a big impact on the wedding budget/expenses to shift the date by a week or so?

It sounds like you would move the date, which is interesting and suggests some of this is \u201cthe principal\u201d but still, you can have your wedding whenever you want, so NTA.\n\nBut there is a lot in your post beyond the date about this Facebook situation. That situation could create an ESH if you are also asking about it. We need a lot more info though. You said your wife\u2019s post was \u201cdiscrete,\u201d but discrete is going a LOT if work in that sentence, and it is tough to know how discrete it could be if your family readily identified what it was about and it caused drama. And it sounds like you know the FB post wasn\u2019t in great taste because you didn\u2019t want your wife doing it.\n\nSo NTA on the question you asked, possible ESH on the situation more generally.", "NTA. Keep your date and don\u2019t expect an apology from Ava. In fact you might want to tell her it\u2019s ok she doesn\u2019t have to apologize because it would ring hollow. Then tell her she doesn\u2019t have to worry about your wedding date because she\u2019s no longer invited. Then follow through. She\u2019s selfish. \n\nMy mom had to postpone my birthday (summer birthday) because my aunt was getting divorced that day and wanted my mother to go to court with her. My mother and aunt explained this to me. I was turning 9yrs old. Guess what? I didn\u2019t have a fit or become upset. I went with my mother and aunt to the courthouse as support. My mother and I treated my aunt to lunch that day and we celebrated my birthday another day that same week.

I'd guess she tends to ruin everyone's good time too. \n\nYou're not wrong in that you shouldn't have to accommodate her personal preferences just to avoid a tantrum, but you did know there was likely going to be a tantrum. \n\nYou knew that the date would be a problem for her. You know that she's unwilling to compromise and that she makes everything about her. \n\nI'm not sure what the solution is that doesn't involve letting go of a little pride.

Yet for the past 10 years of your relationship you've made your fianc\u00e9e do the same as you while you essentially assumed your dad's role by saying \"everything is going to be fine\" while fully knowing that's a lie.\n\nWhy would you give or rather, concede such an important job as deciding on the venue to your stepmom?

Even so, we still weren't sure, that was the date we had in mind based on the factors. The reason she even volunteered in the first place is that she didn't like one of the venues we chose. She basically just decided that she'd take over finding the venue, so we canceled all other visits we had that month. And on the day she agreed to find a venue for us, she asked us what date we were thinking. So it's not the first time she's heard that date. We didn't know it was that big a deal until the day she flipped out. We'd been staying at their house all week.", "To clarify, it was a tentative date (I said this to her right before she stormed off\u2014As mentioned in the post) and we were visiting venues before she even volunteered. How she even ended up volunteering to get the venue, is because she didn't like one of our selections so she literally just stepped in and said she'd handle it. Also, she asked us what date we were thinking of and simply said \"okay\" when we told her. \n\nShe literally didn't express how big a deal it was until the day she started flipping out. As I mentioned earlier, we literally wouldn't have had an issue reconsidering the date if she'd just come to me and spoken like I'm a human being. This is the issue I've always had with her.

It does work in reverse depending on the time of year", "It wasn't intentional.

Sorry if that wasn't made clear but I stated this in the post and I also told her this as well. Various factors helped narrow it down such as availability, budget, etc. so I really wasn't trying to \"test\" or antagonize anyone.

It also worked out cost-wise and it was one of the dates that was available for the venues since we actually started looking for venues way before she stepped in. She chose to take over the venue after she saw one of our options and deemed it \"not worthy\". And honestly, I feel like the only reason she did that was because she wanted me to deal with something at her office while she was traveling. She called when we were on our way to visit a site that was about 1.5 hours away and she insisted I turn back because \"The venue is trash\" and that \"She'll deal with the venue\". This is literally how she volunteered. And no, this isn't the first time she's popped up with a favor and insisted a change up my schedule to suit her needs.", "Thanks.

My wife is super ADD and doesn't remember dates so she didn't catch it. My MIL and other family members obviously noticed but they asked (once) why we chose that date, we explained the very tight Venn-diagram of scheduling conflicts that led to that conclusion, then nobody made any fuss about it. I didn't even find out until the morning after our wedding when my MIL actually planned a brunch for the families, we had all eaten, everyone sat there while we opened our wedding gifts, things were winding down, then at the very end of the event her brothers brought out a cake for her and we sang happy birthday and had some cake. \n\nThere are ways to handle situations like this with grace while assuming good will on everyone's parts.

They never go against her and I think it makes her feel like she can overstep with no consequences.", "I think you can write a pretty vague FB post but with someone as ego centric as your step mom or in really specific cases (such as a wedding) people will figure out who is who. AITA is good for anonymity although people can be a bit harsh.", "I understand what you're saying. I initially didn't know about the post (and I honestly didn't agree with it either) but I get that she wanted to share her experience. She says she's learned a lot from other people sharing their own, and so she didn't see an issue with it. Plus, she just wanted to express how she felt. Truth be told, she initially wanted to call them and give them a piece of her mind, but I just didn't want to deal with it. During that whole humiliating moment, she also wanted to speak up to her but she didn't want to disrespect her in her house.\n\nMy fiance can be brutally honest. She wears her heart on her sleeve and it kills her to bottle up her feelings. Even if she's silent, you can still tell she's upset no matter how hard she tries to hide it. She's seen a lot of her behavior over the past 7+ years and tried to play the whole game like the rest of the family, but it was hard for her.\n\nAva can't handle being told that she's wrong because no one in the family ever holds her accountable so I always kept my mouth shut, especially as a kid. Sometimes a small rebuttal from me would set her off and my dad or friends had to come in front of her. I feel like I've asked my fiance for enough in trying to smile and just overlook everything so I left the post thing alone.

Why do you want this specific date, especially when you haven't even reserved a venue yet? Either the date has special meaning to you (which is great, go for it, and Ava can suck it up), but if that's not the case, you should first figure out the venue you want and *then* determine a specific date, because venues aren't available 24/7, and if it's a popular wedding venue there's a good chance it's already mostly reserved less than a year in advance. So you won't have that much choice when it comes to the date.\n\nLike I'm not saying Ava isn't overreacting, she's definitely got a stick up her arse, but why are you so hellbent on this date?", "I'm sure you've figured it out by now but for the love of God don't let her handle ANYTHING in regards to the wedding because I'd bet money she'd intentionally screw it up.

My MIL would have been chill about it too but would have told me when her bday was at least lol.", "Thanks, I appreciate you sharing your own experience\u2014It's so relatable because, initially, we really weren't thinking about her birthday. It was just so many different factors (cost, weather, etc.) and they all just tied into us wanting a summer wedding, along with advice from coordinators and venue owners. But all things considered, we were still open to changes regardless. My thing is, whenever they have anything, me and my fiance are never above switching up our plans, sometimes without even thinking. \n\nRescheduling company meetings, dinner dates, flights, etc. and I guess I just thought that because we're all family and we always talked about being there for each other, it wouldn't be an issue for them. 1. They only recently started traveling on her birthday (like the last 3 birthdays) and 2. I am never in the loop about their travel plans anyway unless I happen to be at their house when they're packing or my little brother casually mentions it, so it was just the furthest thing from our minds when choosing the date. \n\nNo malicious intent. I even tried to explain this to her in the midst of her running us out, but she literally cut me off and screamed at us to get out. I just want the respect, is all. I wouldn't even have a problem changing the date if she'd just came to us in a civilized manner.", "By success, do you mean her income? Does she have power because she controls the household funds?", "Sorry. We're honestly not hellbent on the date. Yes we could've chosen a different date but that specific day came about because of budget reasons, availability for some of the venues we already found (pre-Ava offering to take over the venue search), weather, etc. Plus, we prefer an \"end of month\" kind of date for most things we're doing as we feel like that will give us adequate time to prepare if it's later in the month. But in all honestly, if she'd just came and asked us to change the date, we would have. I just don't want to accept her going about things like this anymore. If I don't put a stop to it now, who knows how she'll overstep next?", "No. It's not that at all.", "I'd like to know the answer to that too. Also puzzled about why a 29 year old man would cancel appointments to see venues just because his Stepmother doesn't like one of them. What does it matter what Stepmother wants when she isn't the one getting married there. I would have told her to sling her hook months/years ago.", "Very good question. Fair question, actually. Normally, when she offers to do things, she comes through because a lot of people love her (she's saved quite a few lives in her profession, so people are willing to do anything for her). I also find it hard to tell her no most of the time, because she's really pushy and persistent (To be honest, this is the hardest thing I've done so far because it's hard to tell her no and I usually just apologize and go with what she wants). \n\nPlus, Dad said it meant a lot to them to be involved. When we moved out, prepped for college graduation, etc. he said they felt \"excluded\" from those important things and he wanted us to include them from now on. If I'm being honest, I didn't purposefully exclude them. I just got so used to doing things on my own because it was sometimes like pulling teeth asking them for favors back then. \n\nHe said we went about everything all by ourselves without \"consulting them\" so I just thought I was doing the right thing, I guess (I know it sounds dumb but I just thought it was right at the time). When we moved out, I thought our relationship was better. I didn't fight with them as much, and they were a lot more respectful and included me in stuff more, so I guess I thought things were different.", "When I asked about it later, she just said she didn't want to stress out a bride while planning her wedding.

Whenever she visits, she causes problems for our family, saying derogatory things about our country and spreading lies to their family abroad.

You and your fiance deserve more!!! And your father is a fool for allowing this behaviour to continue for so long... She's nothing but the +1 as far as I'm concerned. Yeah maybe she had a few kind moments in your life and helped you here and there.
