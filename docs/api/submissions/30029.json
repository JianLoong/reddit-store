We had a few site visits scheduled, but she usually came through for us so I trusted her. But if I'm being honest, Ava and I haven't always had the best relationship, because of how demanding, aggressive, and mean she can be.\n\nRegardless I always tried to keep the peace both as a child and even now as an adult. She's done a lot for me so I didn't want to be ungrateful. When she did something wrong, Dad often told me that it was just \"how she is\" but I never truly got used to her. My bio mom, while she couldn't do much for me financially, is the opposite of Ava, so it was hard to accept Ava because my own mom never stressed me out like that.\n\nA while back, my fiance and I went back to our hometown. We usually stay with my parents or hers. While we were with my parents, I asked Ava how the venue was going. She aggressively asked if we changed the date yet. The date we chose is the day after her birthday and she likes to travel during that time. \n\nI said no and explained that it was the tentative date we had for now. She angrily stormed off. Not a surprise. It was always her way or the highway, but I felt like just this once, they would make an exception for my wedding. When she came back, she immediately started telling us how \"disrespectful\" we were for choosing that date and not changing it. Before I could speak, she screamed, (with profanities) at us to get out of her house.\n\nWe felt humiliated, getting berated by her whilst packing. A few days later, my fiance wrote a discrete FB post about the situation, sharing her thoughts from the experience. I didn't really want her sharing it on FB but I felt guilty putting her through that. She was never comfortable around Ava and she always said this but I kept reassuring her that everything was okay. My mistake. She always tried to be chill but has always hated my family's dynamic of just sweeping Ava's behavior under the rug. \n\nI got a call from Dad shortly after because the post got attention. Even though he admits that she shouldn't have done that (since the house belongs to them both), he still tried to get me to see it her way (as usual) and proceeded to make the situation about the FB post and how we \"never included them in the wedding plans\". \n\nI politely let him know that there's no compromise here and that we want an apology.

The action I took that should be judged is choosing the wedding date knowing that my parents and brother travel each year for my step mom's birthday. I'm aware that they do. I just wish they could have made the exception for my big day because we really wanted that date. It was just the most convenient for us, the bridal/groom parties and what we wanted.\n\n2. Well, my dad accused me of purposefully choosing that date to exclude my step mom. This isn't true and I let him know that but it got me thinking: Do they really see it that way?

Since it's a tentative date & venue was not booked yet, would it have made a big impact on the wedding budget/expenses to shift the date by a week or so?

It sounds like you would move the date, which is interesting and suggests some of this is \u201cthe principal\u201d but still, you can have your wedding whenever you want, so NTA.\n\nBut there is a lot in your post beyond the date about this Facebook situation. That situation could create an ESH if you are also asking about it. We need a lot more info though. You said your wife\u2019s post was \u201cdiscrete,\u201d but discrete is going a LOT if work in that sentence, and it is tough to know how discrete it could be if your family readily identified what it was about and it caused drama. And it sounds like you know the FB post wasn\u2019t in great taste because you didn\u2019t want your wife doing it.\n\nSo NTA on the question you asked, possible ESH on the situation more generally.", "NTA. Keep your date and don\u2019t expect an apology from Ava. In fact you might want to tell her it\u2019s ok she doesn\u2019t have to apologize because it would ring hollow. Then tell her she doesn\u2019t have to worry about your wedding date because she\u2019s no longer invited. Then follow through. She\u2019s selfish. \n\nMy mom had to postpone my birthday (summer birthday) because my aunt was getting divorced that day and wanted my mother to go to court with her. My mother and aunt explained this to me. I was turning 9yrs old. Guess what? I didn\u2019t have a fit or become upset. I went with my mother and aunt to the courthouse as support. My mother and I treated my aunt to lunch that day and we celebrated my birthday another day that same week.

I'd guess she tends to ruin everyone's good time too. \n\nYou're not wrong in that you shouldn't have to accommodate her personal preferences just to avoid a tantrum, but you did know there was likely going to be a tantrum. \n\nYou knew that the date would be a problem for her. You know that she's unwilling to compromise and that she makes everything about her. \n\nI'm not sure what the solution is that doesn't involve letting go of a little pride.

Yet for the past 10 years of your relationship you've made your fianc\u00e9e do the same as you while you essentially assumed your dad's role by saying \"everything is going to be fine\" while fully knowing that's a lie.\n\nWhy would you give or rather, concede such an important job as deciding on the venue to your stepmom?

Even so, we still weren't sure, that was the date we had in mind based on the factors. The reason she even volunteered in the first place is that she didn't like one of the venues we chose. She basically just decided that she'd take over finding the venue, so we canceled all other visits we had that month. And on the day she agreed to find a venue for us, she asked us what date we were thinking. So it's not the first time she's heard that date. We didn't know it was that big a deal until the day she flipped out. We'd been staying at their house all week.", "To clarify, it was a tentative date (I said this to her right before she stormed off\u2014As mentioned in the post) and we were visiting venues before she even volunteered. How she even ended up volunteering to get the venue, is because she didn't like one of our selections so she literally just stepped in and said she'd handle it. Also, she asked us what date we were thinking of and simply said \"okay\" when we told her. \n\nShe literally didn't express how big a deal it was until the day she started flipping out. As I mentioned earlier, we literally wouldn't have had an issue reconsidering the date if she'd just come to me and spoken like I'm a human being. This is the issue I've always had with her.

It does work in reverse depending on the time of year", "It wasn't intentional.

Sorry if that wasn't made clear but I stated this in the post and I also told her this as well. Various factors helped narrow it down such as availability, budget, etc. so I really wasn't trying to \"test\" or antagonize anyone.

Good luck!", "This is how my mothers house was with my step-father. I thanked God every day that I didn't live with them full time. \n\nYou have to stand up to a bully. Step dad finally learned that I wouldn't put up with his shit, and he didn't pull it on me, he knew I would go NC with him and my mom, and fortunately mom wouldn't let him cause that. But he still bullied everyone else.", "Then take all the planning and what comes with that back asap.\nShe took this away because she didn\u2019t like your ideas for venues, who does she think she is\u2026 the bride?\nNah,, that\u2019s your fianc\u00e9.. and you and her need to figure out what is right for you guys\u2026\nTell your father that from now on your going to do what is right for your micro family, and if that means Ava isn\u2019t happy then so be it..\nYou already told her the date isn\u2019t set in stone, so she reacted way out of line\u2026\nDon\u2019t budge for her. Only for your own comfort if needed be.\nI hoop your planning will be smooth from now on, and do not include Ava in anything, just tell after the fact/booking (if you want to) what you\u2019ve planned..", "That\u2019s abuse. Stop her cycle of abuse by NOT doing what she demands and make conditions of her behavior just to get an invite. If she doesn\u2019t quit her horrible behavior, cut her out of your life completely for the rest of her life!", "Thank you for clearing that up, I understand it a bit better now. \n\nStill NTA and I'd exclude her from any wedding planning from here on out, set boundaries and don't move those no matter how bad she gets. If she keeps causing issues I'd talk to both her and your dad, make clear you want a drama free wedding and if they (stepmom) can't guarantee to be on their best behavior, they won't be invited.", "Yeah sure.", "Why that particular week? Are there reasons yiu couldn't do it a different summer day?"]}
