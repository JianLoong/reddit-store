You didn't get them kicked out.  The staff  member chose to remove them after watching them carefully.", "Honestly, I think you did this woman a favor, if she had tripped or fallen down when intoxicated it could\u2019ve turned into a real horror show, so no, you\u2019re not the asshole here, you didn\u2019t kick out the woman, the staff member chose to kick them out because she was too intoxicated, all you did was made them aware of the situation, in my opinion, that\u2019s called being a good Samaritan.\n\nNAH, you\u2019re not a bad guy for caring about other people, the staff member isn\u2019t the bad guy because he\u2019s just doing his job, and the intoxicated woman. I\u2019m not gonna say she\u2019s a bad guy she just made a stupid decision, I mean she chose to get drunk in a public place so in other words, play stupid games, win, stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nwhen did it become socially acceptable and ok to just be staggering drunk in public? If this had been in a bar, they'd have taken her keys and ordered her an uber or cab home.", "NTA - honestly a drunk woman stumbling through the park, let alone a Haunted House which is dark and requires careful attention, is a liability for the park. If she injured herself or someone else, the park would be on the hook for damages. If you hadn't reported her, the park employees still would have acted as soon as they noticed her state.", "NTA- you didn't get her removed from the park. You expressed your concern and a trained staff member removed her for her own safety. Amusement parks are supposed to be fun, not actually dangerous.", "NTA.\n\nPublic intoxication is a thing for a reason.  If she was acting out enough for you to notice, I'm sure others did as well, and nobody wants to be responsible for a safety risk.", "NTA. \n\nIf she was just a little tipsy, that would have been fine. But she sounded like she was full on drunk and stumbling, which is a liability both to herself and to the park. \n\nYou probably saved her an expensive trip to the hospital.", "NTA.\n\n>she wasn\u2019t actually hurting anyone\n\nWaiting until she's *actually* hurt someone is pointless. \n\nYou didn't get her kicked out. She got herself kicked out.", "Public intoxication is illegal. it was done for her safety and the safety of others, NTA", "NTA.  You may have prevented an accident.", "NTA, and nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA. Health and safety first.", "NTA--- She could have hurt herself or others. You did the right thing.", "NTA; though this is a Rule #7 violation and will probably be dropped soon. \n\nI'd be more concerned about her puking in the haunted areas, so I don't blame you.", "NTA\n\nIt is 100% okay to say what you are and aren't comfortable with, you did a good thing by alerting the staff. If it wasn't you who alerted them, someone else who may have handled the situation in a worse way may have alerted them or she might have actually ended up hurting someone or herself. If she really was fine and it was a false alarm on your behalf, the staff and security would have let her get back to enjoying the night as per usual but clearly she was not.", "NTA, and I have no idea why you'd feel guilty for reporting someone who was engaged in criminal behavior.", "NTA, she wont even remember.", "NTA\n\nYou actually helped her in the end from getting hurt or anyone else in that matter. You did her favor, so please don't feel bad.", "She was a walking liability to herself. Her actions got her kicked out. NTA", "NTA", "NTA- People who can't drink responsibly should not go out and drink in public.", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't your business. Worrying about a drunk person falling in a haunted house and hurting you isn't rational. This wasn't a legitimate safety concern - this was your moral disapproval of the drunk woman.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
