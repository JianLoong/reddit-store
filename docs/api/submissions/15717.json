I have a son (8) whose Dad I\u2019m not in a relationship with. My partner owns a pub that I work at on a Saturday when my son is with his Dad (the only day he\u2019s with him). I recently qualified as a social worker. Sunday is my only day off & is generally taken up by me cleaning the house, taking my son swimming, taking the dog out, going shopping, helping my son with any homework he might still have & making sure uniforms etc are clean & ironed. \nAll of this to say, I don\u2019t really have much free time.\n\nLast night at 11pm, I got a call from my best friend because she was upset, so I got out of bed & we were on the phone for an hour.\n\nShe said she\u2019s fed up of being sad all of the time. All she does is go to work & come home. She feels like she doesn\u2019t have anybody. She said that I annoy her & I\u2019m part of the problem as I don\u2019t see her often.\n\nI apologised for this & said I would try to do better. Short of being at her beck & call, I don\u2019t know what else I can do?\n\nI text her checking in on her; I message her asking if she wants to FaceTime; I make plans to see her but they fall through & I\u2019m expected to go to her; I tag her in things on Twitter/Instagram; I respond to her Snapchat & Facebook posts. She doesn\u2019t reply. When she does, it can be days/weeks later. Am I supposed to keep texting until she responds? I will still text, just not every day.\n\nWhen we do FaceTime, the call is always about her. Even when I\u2019ve had things going on that I\u2019ve wanted to talk to her about, it ultimately circles back to what she\u2019s got going on. This is fine, I understand she needs to talk, I will happily listen but sometimes we\u2019re on the phone for 2-3 hours? Surely I\u2019m allowed to tell her about my life as well?\n\nShe\u2019s prescribed antidepressants which I thought she was taking but I found out she stopped months ago. She\u2019s meeting random men on tinder, giving them her address to pick her up, then getting upset when she doesn\u2019t hear from them again. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about this but it falls on deaf ears.\n\nShe\u2019s drinking excessively, which isn\u2019t helping matters. When we facetime, she wants me to have a drink with her, but I\u2019m trying to address my own relationship with alcohol so it\u2019s not something I want to do. \n\nShe\u2019s got childhood trauma & doesn\u2019t have much to do with her family. She can\u2019t afford counselling & wait lists for CAMHS are upwards of 2yrs. Getting her to go to the GP is a nightmare, she won\u2019t even ring them. She said she\u2019d go if I go too but that would cost me \u00a330 fuel, a day\u2019s annual leave & childcare. It\u2019s not something I can easily afford. I\u2019m trying to be as supportive as I can & I\u2019ve booked off the day of her graduation so that she\u2019s got somebody there for her. \n\nI feel guilty because she said that I\u2019m part of the problem for how she is feeling & I don\u2019t make her a priority.\n\nAITA for not doing more & not being there for her?", "created_utc": 1682504431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zd3qy/aita_for_not_being_there_for_my_best_friend/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But explanations aren't excuses, and she isn't holding up this side of your lopsided friendship. Maybe she truly CAN'T do anything else right now, but that doesn't change the fact that you're putting more in to your friendship than you're getting out. \n\nYou are NOT part of her problem, and don't let her convince you that you are.  So DO NOT feel guilty, no matter what she says, and don't let her accuse you of being part of her problems simply because you can't magically give her everything she needs all the time, and solve all her problems for her! \n\nYou're doing all you can, and that's more than many people would bother to do.", "NTA, you are not your friend's keeper. As you said, you're trying to address your own issues. Beware of the relationships that try to pull you down and set clear boundaries.", "NTA. \n\n>I feel guilty because she said that I\u2019m part of the problem for how she is feeling & I don\u2019t make her a priority.\n\nYou feel guilty because she's making you feel guilty. You haven't done anything wrong. She is a priority, but she has to accept that she isn't, and can't be, your main one. You make time to keep in touch with her even though you have a lot of other commitments. She would bleed you dry if you gave her the opportunity.", "NTA you sounds like a great friend", "NTA!\nMASSIVE \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9.

It is infuriating how difficult it is to get mental health care. That is one of her biggest problems, not you. She is hurting and lashing out. I don't know exactly what you can do to help her. I do know that you can help yourself by setting boundaries, and accepting that even if you had all the time in the world to devote to her, you couldn't \"fix\" her. I struggle with depression and it can feel like the world is attacking you and why isn't anyone just making it better? It isn't fair to put that on you. You need to decide what you can handle, if any of it, and set and enforce those boundaries. Know that an extra drive or hour on the phone isn't the answer. Give what you can while keeping yourself and your son healthy, and then let go of everything you can't control. I would actually even suggest Al-Anon materials. I don't know if she has addiction issues, but the codependency in the relationship definitely reflects that of an addict and those in their life. The hardest lesson is letting go of responsibility for things you can't control. I am still perfecting that. I wish you both the best.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds to me like you go over and above for your friend, but she needs the kind of help and attention that only a therapist can provide,\n\nHer unrealistic expectations of you are what's making her worse, not you, and it isn't okay that she's making you responsible for her own feelings. You do mention that she's on a waiting list for CAMHS, which is a mental health service for children and adolescents, so it sounds like her age may be playing a large part in how she's reacting to this. What's the age gap between you two?\n\nIf you haven't already, I think you need to sit her down and tell her that you do as much as you can, but your other commitments mean there's a limit to how available you can be for her. Also, make it clear that you don't appreciate being told that you're part of the problem when you're doing your level best to support her. Mental health problems or not, she has no right to make you feel guilty.\n\nIf she doesn't take this on-board, then I think you need to step back. Point her in the direction of Samaritans (116 123 or jo@samaritans.org), CALM (0800 58 58 58) and SANEline (0300 304 7000) so she can talk to someone who is better trained to listen and provide advice when she needs it. \n\nThis is a really difficult situation to navigate and you have my sympathy, but you need to prioritise yourself now because it sounds like her dependency on you is starting to have a negative effect on your wellbeing.", "NTA, you\u2019re a good friend to her. Set your boundaries, and keep the level of contact you find reasonable, without it resulting in dragging you and your family down with her. That often happens. \n\nI\u2019d also try to not burn any bridges. She\u2019s sick now, but perhaps not forever. You know why she\u2019s down, but that\u2019s not a green card for hurting people. Cut youreslf some slack, and if that leads to her cutting you off, let her. If she comes around later it\u2019s still up to you how your friendship grows back or fizzles out.", "NTA\n\nEverything is your fault but she won\u2019t do anything to help herself?\n\nAnd she\u2019s always having a drama but when you need to talk suddenly she\u2019s not interested?\n\nSorry OP but if she won\u2019t help herself or acknowledge she needs to make better decisions then you can\u2019t help her\n\nShe can\u2019t keep guilting you into taking the blame for everything and needs to take personal responsibility \n\nTime to practice tough love and give her an ultimatum, Either she goes to see someone or you don\u2019t want to know", "NTA. That\u2019s nonsense  that she wants you to make her a priority . She can\u2019t blame you for having your family and work. That\u2019s life and things change.\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty. You were doing what a good friend should. You checked up on her and made plans. That isn\u2019t your fault she falls through on plans. Your friendship def sounds one sided. There\u2019s not much you can do with her when she\u2019s refusing help. \n\nSometimes the best thing to do is let the friend/friendship go. And love & pray for them at a distance", "NTA your friend is going to have to be there for herself before you can be there for her. Sometimes the best thing for YOU is to accept that someone you live is not in a good enough space to love you back, and for your own mental health and sanity you need to step away until they work through what they need to work through.", "NTA. You sound like a great friend, to be honest.\n\nBut your bestie sounds like she's an absolute train wreck. Fixing her life is out of your scope. Also, you can't fix somebodies life for them (which she kinda demands from you). THEY need to want to fix it. THEY need to start somewhere. You as a friend could then help them at their journey, but you can't walk it for them.", "NTA\n\nYour friend isn't looking to you for friendship, she's looking to you for an on-call and at-home therapist service. Sounds to me like it's time to put up some boundaries for yourself.", "A true friend would understand the demands you have. It is not your responsibility to 'cure her' and that is unreasonable on her part. \n\nIt is her responsibility to get the proper care to manage her mental health issues. You can support her but it is up to her. \n\nMy suspicion is that she was not nurtured as a child and is now seeking that you and others. Understandable based on trauma. However, realistically, it is not your role and she will need to come to terms with that - hopefully in therapy with a professional.", "NTA. You sound like the sort of friend I needed when I was depressed. I learned something pretty profound though during those years I struggled with depression (I still do, mind) and that was that my mental health was well within my control to do something about. Prescribed meds? Take them. Meds don\u2019t work? Go back to the drawing board until you find ones that do. Your new Psychologist isn\u2019t going great? Go back and get a referral to a different one, until you find one who works. The good news for your friend is with respect to her mental health the buck stops with her. The bad news for her though is the buck stops with her. It\u2019s not her fault she suffers from those conditions, but it\u2019s her active choice (though not necessarily conscious choice) not to do something about it. Sounds like she\u2019s looking for anyone to blame for her problems rather than confront them", "Is this \u201cfriendship\u201d even worth it?

Yes someone mentioned this above. I thought CAMHS offered adult services and children\u2019s.

That's not to say you should give up on her, but setting limits/boundaries for yourself is perfectly reasonable, so that she doesn't drag you down with her. \n\nAlways remember that selfcare isn't really selfish -- you have to take care of YOURSELF, or else you end up burning out, and then you can't take care of others.", "I feel you. Many of my friendships have been based on this same model for a variety of reasons, but parent friendships aren\u2019t sustainable, especially with a mentally unstable \u2018child friend\u2019.

Boundaries are extremely hard in that situation, and sadly I can't promise that she will be alright. I can only say with a lot of confidence that you can't save her. You can only be there as much as you are able, and by able I mean without hurting yourself. Your son needs you. No judgment on her, but I know how easily someone hurting like that can accidentally pull someone else down. She needs professional help, and it isn't your fault she can't get it. I really do encourage something like Al-Anon if you have it there. They really do help you learn to take care of you and offer great support.", "Ah I see! No problem at all.\n\nWith regards to her GP, there really isn't anything you can do for her besides encouraging her to call them when you can. In the meantime, calling one of the mental health charities I mentioned might be a stopgap until she finds the strength to reach out to her GP.\n\nAs someone else here said, she is an unwell person behaving like an unwell person, but you're doing your best for her.

Your friend is so desperate that she is crying out for more from you, but I think you know that dropping everything to be there when she demands it isn't going to help her in the long-term. She will come to expect more and more from you until she is entirely dependent on you to function, and that's not a situation that either of you need to be in.\n\nNHS mental health services are at saturation point right now, so I can absolutely understand how utterly helpless she feels, but there are charities out there she can contact for support.

I\u2019m not afraid of telling her what she needs to hear and being honest with her, it\u2019s just that at this point, I don\u2019t know what more I can do to try and be supportive.", "That\u2019s erm, actually quite a valid point that I hadn\u2019t considered \ud83d\ude05 cleaning the bathroom and doing multiples loads of laundry whilst avoiding standing on Lego bricks isn\u2019t my idea of fun after a long day in work, but here I am anyway \ud83d\ude05 she wants to FaceTime again tonight, and I agreed, so will speak to her about it properly if the call does go ahead", "You can t help someone who refuses to help themselves op. NTA. She needs to take her medication", "Idk if it makes you feel any better but I was in your friends position and I never blamed my friends for my own issues. Like literally this post could have been written about me, except I just went into isolation, I didn't expect anyone to \"try harder\". You shouldn't feel bad at all.\n\nThere was a point I just couldn't get myself help. I absolutely pushed my friends away. But I never expected them to drop everything and make it all about me. I didn't try to excuse my actions or blame them. Luckily they understood (my struggles involved me becoming physically disabled so there was huge external factors involved), but I would have understood if they didn't. It's not at all fair or okay for her to put any blame on you. She needs to get herself help before she can expect you to.", "> I don\u2019t know what more I can do to try and be supportive.\n\nNothing.  She's not looking for support, she's looking for enabling and a scape goat.  \"I'm a drunken mess, and that's your fault.  I take no actions to improve my life, and that's your fault.  I have one night stands with strangers, while expecting to find a stable, long-term relationship, and it's your fault that this doesn't work.'\n\nBy using you for this, she shifts blame away from herself.\n\nYou're not only allowed to prioritize your own health, mental wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and safety over hers, you have to.\n\nLike I said, you're not her therapist, you're not her events coordinator, you're not her social assistance worker, and from everything you've described, you're not even her friend.\n\nYou're just some guy setting yourself on fire to keep her warm while she insists on climbing into a freezer.", "That sounds really traumatic for you, I hope you\u2019re in a much better place now!! I\u2019m so glad your friends stuck around and didn\u2019t let you push them away \ud83e\udd70", "This, and a bit more. When I was that depressed (the self sabotaging level) I actually felt like I didn't *deserve* my friends' attention and they were better off without me, so reading this is oddly jarring. Like, I can relate to a lot of the friend's issues... But then that one bit is so completely foreign I can't even process it.", "I\u2019m sorry you felt that way. I can assure you that you absolutely did deserve your friends and their attention, and they would definitely think so too \ud83e\udd0d", "That's kind of you, thank you! \ud83d\ude0a And yes, I know these things logically now, but at the time it was a legitimate handicap. Thankfully, the duration was brief! I only entered self sabotage after I'd got past the worst of it and was confronted with the initial reality of recovery. I recall I \"broke\" in November, self sabotaged after Christmas, was recovered enough to return to work in February (? Ish. Can't remember specifics), came back to life in May/June. I was still pretty fragile for the next few years, but medication balanced it out.  \n\nYour friend has a much longer thing going on by the sound of it, and I feel sorry for her. But her experience is *so* different to mine, not just in duration ... I can't grasp either having had the energy to have that kind of fight, or the entitlement (possibly wrong word) to start it in the first place. And I know we all have different brains, I'm not accusing her of faking or whatever the Tiktok thing is, I'm just bewildered.", "NTA there is no A here. Your friend is sick and alone and she is not behaving well. You have a family to prioritize and a life to live. It is a sad and difficult situation but at the end of the day the only person who can really help your friend is a professional.", "NTA: You sound like you have your own life and responsibilities you are tending to. Some plates just have to be put down so you can juggle the rest of them. It sounds like you really do try to reach out when you are able to among everything else that you've got going on in your life but that it doesn't seem to be matching your friend's expectations of the relationship.\n\nIt also kind of sounds like your friend is using you as free therapy/venting grounds (especially if she won't go visit a GP without you there) like you can be HER PERSON but you cannot BE HER FOR HER.", "NTA. A lot of people here are being too easy your friend and this is going come across harsh but she is not being your friend right now , she is using you as an emotional punching bag . And by not responding to you because she is mad that you are not being \u201cthere for her \u201c even though you have tried to help her and be there for her . I have a ex friend who was like this , she has similar experiences that your friend have , every time we talk , it was always about her issues and she would get mad at me if I disagreed with her . I don\u2019t know if your friend does that but the fact she not talking to you when you are not \u201cthere\u201d for her when you weren\u2019t at her beck and call is very manipulative. My ex friend does this every time she gets mad at me , she would blocked me and not talk to me for awhile , sometimes years! I ve spent so much time with her  and all I got was her being verbally and mentally abusive to me . She even threaten to punch me one time when we were arguing . All of the advices I gave her did not matter as long as she felt superior then me .\n\nTo be clear here , I am not saying your friend is being abusive but sharing my experience here .  \n\nSo I completely get that your friend has trauma and going through a lot right now and you want to help her . You seem like you are a person with big heart and cares a lot. But her getting upset every time you don\u2019t do what she want is not healthy . \nYou cannot help someone who does not want to be helped. Do yourself a flavor and minimize contact with her for your own mental health , she has to be one to want help and to get therapy and it has to be her decision . You can support her but don\u2019t let her behave shitty toward you just because she is feeling shitty right now . Have a conversation with her about it ,tell her how it has been emotionally draining you and that you need to take care of yourself but you ll be there if she is ready to get help. And if she still does not hear what you saying ,  move on and make new friends that appreciate you better ."]}
