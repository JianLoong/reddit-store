Only share she can eat each day. Presuming you are visiting her each day, however briefly?  Give her the snack for the day there and then. Don\u2019t leave any extra. \n\nThis way, your grandma is eating something each day and you eliminate the opportunity for the room mate to steal from your grandmother. \n\nAs others have said, I\u2019d also advocate for another room mate", "NTA, you're concerned for your grandmother. Not eating can be a significant issue for people living with dementia.\n\nI empathise with your frustration but if  the other woman also has a cognitive impairment she may well not understand boundaries & shouting will upset her.\n\nPlease raise this with the head of the care facility & request either your grandmother or the other woman be moved if there's no other solution.", "NTA.   \nBut it sounds like you are dealing with people with limited cognitive ability.   \nGet a lock box for the snacks and put them under lock and key. You work there, you can get the key (and give one to the nurse in charge for when you aren\u2019t there), and let her have access to the snacks whenever you unlock it.", "Petty me says to bring something laced with laxatives to teach her roommate a lesson...", "Go straight to the head of the facility in writing to express your concern, especially about the impact on your grandma\u2019s health. Get someone else in the family to write in for you, if you don\u2019t want to sign in your name. \n\nUltimately, the facility can\u2019t control a third party. Older people aren\u2019t like children, they can\u2019t be disciplined. See if a room move is possible (if that\u2019s acceptable for your grandma). \n\nIf no room move is possible for any reason, and the facility can\u2019t help, you may just have to suck it up and buy more snacks.", "The only solution is for the home to find Grandma a room mate that doesn't STEAL from her.  I assume they both have dementia, so no amount of talking or explaining is going to work.", "My father was in a residential home where many of the residents had dementia.  Lots of things were \"stolen\".  Food, watches, brushes, false teeth, pretty much anything.  The \"thefts\" were not with malice or greed, just part of the world of dementia.  Folks doing it are not in their right minds and may not even be aware of what they are doing.  No point in getting worked up about it.\n\nThe only way to ensure that your grandma eats the snacks is to take them in one at a time and watch her eat them.", "NTA go to the facility director with this. If you are not in a position of authority, then someone else needs to handle it. I would say get some sort of lockbox but i dont think grandma would be able to open it. You need absolute proof of this happening so the higher ups can take proper action. Im sure moving grandma again would be an obstacle that no one wants to undertake. For grandmas own mental health as well. \n\nYou could start with a gentle talk with the roommate and try to solve civilly and if it keeps happening, then stronger measures need to happen.\n\nTake good care of grandma, she is the heart of the family. Be blessed", "Are you honestly suggesting the OP should assault an elderly woman by tampering with the food she is eating? \n\nThe OP would be risking not only their job, but ruining any future employment opportunities, and quite possibly be facing a felony criminal charge? \n\nWhat a great solution! /s", "What a great way to go to prison", "Nope roommate is in clean mental state", "I wouldn\u2019t be getting all worked up if she had dementia but the thing is she doesn\u2019t. She is level headed. She knows what she is doing", "It may also be possible grandma is offering to share the snacks\u2026 which would make this not stealing at all, and very messy.", "thats true and with the dementia, grandma might not remember offering.  Its definitely tricky in this situation. ANd the sad part too is that often older people in nursing homes get taken advantage of. Even by other older people.\n\nIts heartbreaking watching someone slowly lose their mind/memory. When someone you love looks at you and doesnt remember who you are, and you having to be strong and know its the disease. its some rough shit"]}
