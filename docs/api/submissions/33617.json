In June of this year,  my husband (33m) and I welcomed a baby boy. He\u2019s the first and only grandchild on my side. My husband and I decided to fly back to my home state to spend Christmas with my family. My parents were excited and assured us they would get the house baby ready. \n\nMy parents live in a 4 bedroom house. My parents have the master and the other 3 rooms belonged to my sisters and me. But now that my folks are empty nesters, the rooms are unused except for occasional visits. They kept my sisters rooms relatively the same but they turned my old room into my dad\u2019s office. I was a little sad, but it\u2019s not my home anymore and I dont get to dictate how other people utilize their house. But in my 11 x 8ft childhood room there is now a queen size bunk bed, dresser, desk, chair, and side table. That alone makes it cramped. But since my dad is very disorganized there\u2019s usually also  paperwork on EVERY surface (including top bed bunk) and random crap from the house. It\u2019s basically a storage closet with a bed. It\u2019s so cluttered that the floor isn\u2019t even visible most of the time. \n\n2 weeks ago I asked if we could NOT stay in my old room. My parents didn\u2019t even entertain it. They said that that\u2019s where I\u2019ve always stayed when I\u2019ve visited and I\u2019ve never had an issue with it (I\u2019ve always taken issue with it, I just never said anything). I explained that there is no room for 2 adults and a pack n play in there but my mom just said they would make it work. The next day, my mom sent me a picture of the room with a pack n play in it. The bed took up the last bit of floor space. I showed it to my husband and we agreed that would not work for us. I let my parents know that we would figure something else out. \n\nBut after looking into local hotels, we decided to cancel the trip all together. My parents live in a very touristy place and getting a hotel for a week on short notice was more than we could afford. I broke the news to my parents and they were not happy. They said I was overreacting and the room would be fine. I told them we would miss them, but we couldn\u2019t afford a hotel, and in order for the room to be usable the floor would have to be at least a little visible. They asked if that meant we would never be visiting and I said \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will never visit, but I do know we will never stay in that room as long as it\u2019s in that condition. If it got a decluttered, or you allowed us to stay in a different room, or if we  saved up enough for a hotel, then we could visit\u201d. \n\nNow my entire family is mad at me. My parents told the extended family we were coming, and now they have to tell them we are not. They\u2019re also sad they won\u2019t get to see their grandson like they planned. My sisters are also calling me entitled for being picky about a free place to stay and expecting one of them to take the crappy room.

Given this if I want to stay at my parents place I now sleep in an actual bedroom, my sisters old room.\n\nMy sister and her bf visited home recently and I went down to stay at my parents place while they were there so I could maximize our time together. I ended up claiming her room because it had a desk in it so I could work from home. Guess what?

It might make sense for them to keep their rooms but not someone who lives hours away and is married with children.", "Nothing better than Christmas morning waffles. \n\nAnd ya I was being sarcastic. Growing up with sisters was a battle and I never believed when people would say one day we will actually like each other, but it actually happened and now they\u2019re my best friends. I would do anything for them. Even give up the good room if necessary\ud83d\ude02\n\nOps parents seem toxic all around. I wonder if they raised their daughters to compete against each other all the time. Maybe the sisters are jealous she has a husband and baby and that\u2019s why they\u2019re being so stubborn? And it seems the parents just want op there to show off the baby to the relatives, not to actually spend time together", "All the rooms are vacant, but when we visit we stay in the rooms we grew up in.

My son is the first great grandchild.", "Ok well that\u2019s good that your extended family is understanding. The way it was written made it seem like everyone included extended fam was mad.

It\u2019s not an invasion of privacy to redecorate a room that someone lived in 15 years ago lmao \n\nObviously you know them better than all of us but wow\u2026 they seem like a lot", "I get it. Then I would just stand your ground and say maybe next year if the sleeping situations are different.

Their favourite of my stuffies - my dad came to visit me at the beginning of last year as he was at conference - so I requested he bring her. I took her back when we went back a month later but my dad was clearly upset and kept asking if the stuffie was \u201cemigrating\u201d\n\nWe then moved across the country and clearly my parents forgot lol so we visited them where we used to live - and I requested they bring her as they were taking a cruise and I wanted pictures of the stuffie on the cruise. Anyway they kept going on about her emigrating so I just took her back home with me\u2026 they were not happy but my kids were - when we go back to the UK in March we will bring her\u2026", "Unfortunately if the mom is disappointed that they aren\u2019t coming that\u2019s completely her fault. Her sisters are clearly spoiled and the mom isn\u2019t trying at all to have them switch rooms or even just move any piece of furniture to make the room more livable.\n\nNo reason to try to make op feel guilty about her mom being excited and then sad they\u2019re not there.
