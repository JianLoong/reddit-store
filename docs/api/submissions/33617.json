In June of this year,  my husband (33m) and I welcomed a baby boy. He\u2019s the first and only grandchild on my side. My husband and I decided to fly back to my home state to spend Christmas with my family. My parents were excited and assured us they would get the house baby ready. \n\nMy parents live in a 4 bedroom house. My parents have the master and the other 3 rooms belonged to my sisters and me. But now that my folks are empty nesters, the rooms are unused except for occasional visits. They kept my sisters rooms relatively the same but they turned my old room into my dad\u2019s office. I was a little sad, but it\u2019s not my home anymore and I dont get to dictate how other people utilize their house. But in my 11 x 8ft childhood room there is now a queen size bunk bed, dresser, desk, chair, and side table. That alone makes it cramped. But since my dad is very disorganized there\u2019s usually also  paperwork on EVERY surface (including top bed bunk) and random crap from the house. It\u2019s basically a storage closet with a bed. It\u2019s so cluttered that the floor isn\u2019t even visible most of the time. \n\n2 weeks ago I asked if we could NOT stay in my old room. My parents didn\u2019t even entertain it. They said that that\u2019s where I\u2019ve always stayed when I\u2019ve visited and I\u2019ve never had an issue with it (I\u2019ve always taken issue with it, I just never said anything). I explained that there is no room for 2 adults and a pack n play in there but my mom just said they would make it work. The next day, my mom sent me a picture of the room with a pack n play in it. The bed took up the last bit of floor space. I showed it to my husband and we agreed that would not work for us. I let my parents know that we would figure something else out. \n\nBut after looking into local hotels, we decided to cancel the trip all together. My parents live in a very touristy place and getting a hotel for a week on short notice was more than we could afford. I broke the news to my parents and they were not happy. They said I was overreacting and the room would be fine. I told them we would miss them, but we couldn\u2019t afford a hotel, and in order for the room to be usable the floor would have to be at least a little visible. They asked if that meant we would never be visiting and I said \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will never visit, but I do know we will never stay in that room as long as it\u2019s in that condition. If it got a decluttered, or you allowed us to stay in a different room, or if we  saved up enough for a hotel, then we could visit\u201d. \n\nNow my entire family is mad at me. My parents told the extended family we were coming, and now they have to tell them we are not. They\u2019re also sad they won\u2019t get to see their grandson like they planned. My sisters are also calling me entitled for being picky about a free place to stay and expecting one of them to take the crappy room.

You offered two easy alternatives (different room, decluttered room) and the response was essentially \u2018no, too bad\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t stay in that case either, as disappointing as it is for miss out on family gatherings.", "NTA\n\nLet them be mad - you are not there anyway. And you do not have to answer every text ot call.\n\nYOu handled that situation well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd tell them: They are welcome to visit you - you have a storage closet they can share, too.", "NTA. Them not making a sincere effort to declutter \"your\" room so it can accommodate two adults and an infant, or either of your sisters sucking it up and taking the \"crappy\" room shows that they clearly aren't THAT excited to see their grandchild and host your small family. It really wasn't a huge ask of you, and I think you have a right to be hurt they couldn't at least clean up a little or offered up a different room.", "NTA - your needs are different now, if it was just you and your husband I might lean towards saying \u201cit\u2019s not ideal but just suck it up for a few days and deal with the inconvenience\u201d, but you\u2019ve got a baby to consider now and if the room arrangement is going to cause issues with your son\u2019s care then you have to put him first and decline, as you did.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why your parents are so fixed on you using the office/your old bedroom and not another room in the house - maybe it\u2019s worth one more attempt to get them to see sense and make adjustments for your new family setup, perhaps by asking your sisters to make it clear that they don\u2019t mind sacrificing the occasional  use of their own former bedrooms in the best interests of their young nephew.  If your sisters won\u2019t do that or if your parents still won\u2019t listen, there may not be much that you can do.", "NTA.  A room that small would be entirely inappropriate for a family of 3, regardless of how it is furnished, or how the furniture is arranged.  Unless your family is willing to assign you to a different room, then your family really doesn't have room for you to stay in that particular house.", "OP did they even explain why they won't let you use one of the other rooms, one that's already laid out as a bedroom! Unfortunately your parents are quite strange expecting you to basically sleep in a very untidy storage/study and a small one at that.", "NTA. They have three rooms, there should be no problem with making at least one of them available for your family.", "NTA- I come from a family of four, my old room was technically the garage that the previous owners had \u201cconverted.\u201d Since we\u2019ve all moved out my parents renovated and my space is now back to a garage. Given this if I want to stay at my parents place I now sleep in an actual bedroom, my sisters old room.\n\nMy sister and her bf visited home recently and I went down to stay at my parents place while they were there so I could maximize our time together. I ended up claiming her room because it had a desk in it so I could work from home. Guess what? It wasn\u2019t a problem at all and they slept in a different room. \n\nIf it were the case where I had the biggest \u201coriginal\u201d room but one of my sisters had a partner and child staying over I would easily switch to the smaller room or even offer to be on a sofa bed. Because it\u2019s not that big a deal. But if I had a baby to handle and obviously needed extra space, then I\u2019d fight for a different room. And ya if my family was about to die on the hill that because that was their og room and they just get it even when situations change and they\u2019re being stubborn then fine. I won\u2019t come. Screw flying out of state with a new baby to be treated like crap", "NTA. A crappy bedroom makes me wonder what else in this overstuffed, trapped-in-time household would also be unsafe for a baby. Decluttering is just one step in future visits.", "NTA and it sounds like your sisters are the ones feeling entitled. How hard would it be to move some of the office furniture to another room? It\u2019s not like you demanded that they make it work, you saw the conditions and it wasn\u2019t the vibe.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t stay in that room in that condition by myself. I definitely wouldn\u2019t stay there with another adult & a baby.", "NTA\n\nThey couldn't even be bothered to prepare a room suitable for your kid. Something that could have been easily done with little effort.\n\nWish you a stressfree Christmas with your family", "NTA. If the accommodations aren\u2019t appropriate for your family, you can\u2019t go. It\u2019s too bad but it happens.", "NTA\n\nIt's particularly telling that your sisters aren't willing to trade.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are other rooms OP could have been offered but her parents expect her to sleep in bunk beds in a room where the floor is covered in litter. Hardly childproof is it.

That\u2019s why the parents are guilt tripping her into coming. OP offered to just stay home and is now getting the 3rd degree.\n\nAnd exactly. A GENEROUS offer would have been one of the other rooms or even to help pay for their hotel room. A cramped room in your parents home isn\u2019t exactly the ritz."]}
