We have 2 kids together (10 & 8).  We live about 30-minutes apart and have split custody but the kids live with me primarily during the school year because I live in a much better school district.  The kids spend 3 weekends a month with their mom during this time.  My ex and I co-parent pretty well in my opinion and usually get along fine.  \n\nMy ex remarried a little over a year after our divorce and has 3-year-old twins with her new husband.  She also now has 2 step-kids (13 & 11) as well.  So when my kids are visiting their mom, there are 6 kids in the house.  My kids hate it because they never truly feel like they are \"at home\" there because their mom's attention is divided so much between all the kids, especially their young half-siblings.  They tell me that they never do any activities when they are there, they pretty much always just stick around the house because it's so much work for my ex and her husband to handle that many kids.  \n\nSo, I make it a point to do something fun the one weekend a month I have my kids at home.  Camping, sporting events, museums, zoos, fairs, festivals, etc.  My kids and I really look forward to planning and doing these things together.  \n\nMy ex has started asking me if it would be possible to include her step-kids in some of these activities because they are getting jealous of all the fun things my kids are doing.  This turned into an argument recently because I told her to stop asking because I her step-kids are not my kids and I have zero desire to build any kind of relationship with them.  \n\nI told her that the only thing stopping her and her husband from doing fun things with the kids is themselves.  She told me it's a lot of work with 6 kids and I wouldn't understand.  I told her it was her choice to marry a man with kids and to have more kids herself and that isn't my problem.  She told me it would be fun bonding experiences for our kids and the step-kids and it would mean a lot to her if I would help her out with that.\n\nI told her that making her life easier is no longer something I am required to do and if she and her husband can't handle all the kids at the same time, then I am more than willing to revisit our custody agreement so I can have our kids more often if that would make her life easier.  That pissed her off and she called me an asshole for being petty about this.  \n\nI ended up telling my kids that they should try to refrain from telling their mom and step-siblings too much about the activities we do together.  They didn't really understand why because we've always told them that they can tell us anything, but I explained it to them the best I could.  \n\nI do feel bad about that part because I want them to know they can be honest with both their parents, but that seems to be the easiest way to keep the step-kids from getting jealous.

Even when they have a new partner when their current resources get stretched they don't see an issue reaching out to the ex they're still attached (as in sharing kids etc) to because that person has done it so often before.", "Exactly where my mind went! Now she's just looking to offload her step kids on OP, as soon as the twins are older, surely this ONE person can handle six kids.\n\nIf two people can't handle six kids, how does it make sense that one person can handle four on his own??\n\nNot to mention, let's be real, these two people aren't even handling four kids between *them*, because I guarantee they're not taking the kids anywhere. Bonding time between *her* stepkids and OP and her kids, *yeah fucking right*.", "Can you even fit 6 kids and 2 adults in a minivan? Or do they take 2 car\u2019s when they haul that mob around?", "And it\u2019s always the parent that would never do the same if the roles were reversed. Imagine him having another kid and asking to drop him/her off on the weekends that the kids are there", "They probably hear that it's what you expect when you marry/get in a relationship with someone with kids advice. They then end up ignoring the fact they're no longer married and they didn't have the extra kids when they were married.", "I\u2019m impressed by the fact that none if the people being asked laughed hysterically in their ex\u2019s face.", "Because they are the most important person in the world, obviously.", "It\u2019s her audacity for.", "I don't doubt this at all.  I make more money than she and her husband do and have fewer expenses. So, it's easier for me to splurge on my kids.  With our current custody agreement, no one has to pay child support because I have the kids more often than she does.  This was agreed upon by everyone involved.  Even if we changed the custody agreement, I would be fine without additional child support from her.  In fact, I would gladly accept nothing from her if it meant getting my kids pretty much full-time.", "Not only that, but her stepkids may have a mother who takes them some weekends.", "I think that's a lot of it. You have to put time into planning but there are low cost activities. \n\nOr they could ask the extended family to take some of the kids. For example, the older kid's deceased mom's family might love having the older kids a weekend a month.", "I saw a dozen different Orthodox Jewish families with 6+ kids at Disney this Succos. Seriously, why can\u2019t these parents take theirs to a regular park? I know quite a few people who manage more, likely on less, and do a better job!", "Lol I think she\u2019s also trying to dump her step kids on her ex because they probably drive her crazy and she wants bonding time with her new, younger children.  Well if that isn\u2019t the consequences of her own poor decisions then I don\u2019t know what is.", "Throw a verdict in there! Have a good night!\n\nNTA", "Maybe just overwhelmed,  but that is not OP's problem.  3 weekends a month she has 6 kids,  and we have no idea how much her husband does. \n\nBut this \"bonding\" is BS.", "REally good point.   Have an unbaised excecutor, with no rights to your money.  Maybe a sibling", "4 kids can be hard to handle, and big age difference between 8 and 13.   \n\nAlso hard to get 8 YO to understand all this.", "That\u2019s asinine.  Why should he spend unnecessary time with his entitled ex?\n\nIt\u2019s not his job to make her life easier.  He gets limited fun time with his kids as is. He needs to worry about his kids and if they end up wanting more custody at their dads that\u2019s a consequence of her actions.", "? That's not the situation w op", "OP didn't remarry? His ex remarried to new kids, and now wants OP to take care of these new kids? Like either you misread the post or are you trying to say that OP's PREVIOUS marriage means he has to accept more kids that arent his now?", "It boggles my mind that people this entitled exist.\n\nLike seriously whats the plan? Keep mooching off of people that have zero obligation to do so? And it sucks for the kids too, growing up with THAT kind of person as a parent.", "Because some people (quite a few, apparently) see babies as fixatives/anchors/duct tape.  If I have kids with this person, it\u2019s Real.  Never mind that kids are already in the picture, the relationship isn\u2019t real til there\u2019s blood involved to tie things together.", "Relationship anchor babies.", "For real, I read so many posts stating \"I have three kids from my previous marriage and my new wife has two from her previous relationship and we have two of our own together and we live in a three bedroom apartment and the kids share rooms on the weekends/weekdays when we have custody and now they're all mad and shit.\" STOP. BREEDING.", "Maybe it's protocol. Get married = make kids with new spouse. Our livelihood be damned, it's a rule!", "Maybe they just want more kids?", "Thank you!\n\nI've always felt this way.\n\nI would think that people who have divorced with kids would not want to repeat this possiblity again, and therefore not have more kids.\n\nWho knows?  I just know that will never be my problem.", "You get a full size van with multiple bench seats. Source: youngest of five.", "Yes. Three kids to each bench. But with two car seats they can only fit 5.", "Yah, it's probably a big part of the reason why the marriage failed in the first place.", "If I were you, I might propose this. Frame it this way: \n\nI know you have a lot on your plate and it seems you may be overwhelmed. The kids have expressed they don't feel the time they spend at your house is very meaningful because you are spread too thin. You are spread so thin you are proposing that I take care of your twins, as well as your step kids. I want you to know I would love to have our kids full time and I would not expect any child support. This suggestion does not come because I think you are a bad mom. I know you love your kids dearly. I know you are are doing your best and I just thought I would put this out there.\n\nOr something along those lines. She sounds kind of like a bad mom, lol, but just say she is a good one and that you just want to put everyone in the best situation possible.", "She may be nervous that if you have the kids more, you may renege on any agreement.  Or you may lose your job.  Or she may want to use your kids as babysitters soon.   Sorry", "Sir, I\u2019m so proud of you for not allowing your entitled ex wife take advantage of you and your kids. \n\nYou did the right thing. Her stepkids are not your responsibility. \nShe needs to understand that you\u2019re not a doormat. \nNTA \n\nNTA", "There are two parents vs one. Sounds like mum is missing the key part here - your kids want to spend time with her so her hubby should respect this by taking the other 4 out and give her time alone with your kids. \n\nAlso camping is a family friendly thing to do that can be cheap. No reason why they can\u2019t try to do something like this. \n\nThe only thing you\u2019d be kinda the AH about is making the comment about additional kids. Then again, you probably wouldn\u2019t have made that comment if she hadn\u2019t tried to palm the responsibility onto you. \n\nOp NTA. Ex AH. Step dad major AH (for even letting you ex ask this question in the first place).", "Sadly, they do not.  Their mother passed away about 6-7 years ago.", "I have had very limited interaction with her step-kids, but they seem like relatively normal kids.  My kids get along with them fine and there haven't been any big problems between them.  But as far as I'm concerned, the step-kids could be the absolute best behaved and polite kids in the world and I still wouldn't want to take them with because I just don't want to.  They're not my kids and I want that time to be just for me and my kids.", "It\u2019s lazy", "People play the \"emotional manipulation\" card like it was the final Exodia piece, and to much the same effect.", "Two people wangling six kids is less children per adult than OP being expected to go out with four children. Ex wife's husband could do outings with HIS children while she stays home with the twins. His two children are probably neglected by both of them in favor of the twins, but it isn't OPs problem to solve.", "Exactly this. They tie their union off with a bio baby and we all live happily ever after. \ud83d\ude44", "That makes so much sense.  Instead of trying to figure out why the last marriage failed, they just quickly move onto the next, and pop another kid out to try and cement things.  Working my way towards completing my Reddit psychology degree lmao.", "Gotta have kids to create a blood bond between the stepsiblings. Makes a stupid kind of sense.", "Interesting! Makes sense.", "Hahaha. I\u2019m gonna use that one.", "I mean, I'm sure that is what they told themselves.  I was looking for a little bit more of a deep dive on the psychology of it all.", "It really depends on the type of car seats you have and the model of vehicle you have.  I have a Tahoe, and we could get 1 infant car seats, two forward facing harness seats, 2 highback car seats, and 1 backless booster. My oldest 2 no longer needs boosters at all, so it's easier, but it is possible to get more than 5 in the car.", "Divorced 4 years ago but she has 3yo twins?\n\nI think I know why the marriage ended.", "You have a gift for sugar coating things. \ud83d\ude00", "With that said I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your ex is neglecting them all together and being the best mom she can to her new kids and step kids. I would still revisit the custody agreement", "NTA.  Why doesn't she take her kids out on the weekend you have yours?\n\nEdit: I mean when you have your and her kids.  You know what I mean.", "NTA.  This is the life she chose.  She and her husband can't/won't handle six kids.  What makes her think that you could, or would want to?  This isn't your responsibility or problem.  Your duty is to your kids, that's it.", "As it should be.", "But would you ever do things with your kids and a couple of their friends? To me this could almost be similar. It might help your kids to have better relations with step siblings. Plus, you never know what the future holds. Good relations with others that will be in your kids lives for a long time can pay off big. I know several people who passed away young for one reason or another, leaving young children behind. Building a strong community ahead of time can really help during hard times.", "Lmao love that comparison, dude", "I want to upvote this to infinity.", "There was a baby kidnapping case in my country quite a few years ago where a couple had quite a few children from previous relationships but couldn't have one together and so kidnapped a baby so they could raise it together. Somehow that made sense to them. \n\nFortunately the baby was returned to the real parents fairly quickly.", "That makes sense too; trying to force a bond between all of the children.", "What if the deep dive is just them wanting more kids?", "Definitely depends on the car seats. You could probably manage 6 if the twins are in boosters. The bulky infant ones don\u2019t leave a lot of room to sit though.", "It only took roughly 18 years of group and individual therapy. It comes in handy.", "That's what I was thinking. But I suppose that'd require effort.", "And I assume the kidnappers are in jail for kidnapping? And now they are not with their kids at all. Some people don\u2019t have a lick of sense!", "They can't say they're not related anymore! Checkmate, kiddos!", "Then I'd say, there's thoughtful people and then there are people like OP's ex.", "Yeah, it totally depends on the type of car seat and the vehicle.  I was more objecting to the assertion that if there are car seats, you can't get more than 5 in the car.", "Well you obviously put the work in. That is some wordsmithing to be proud of.", "Your deeper context is probably really really boring and most likely just a split between impulsive and planning personalities", "The ones I\u2019m most familiar with are those big 3-in-1s, so that\u2019s what I was picturing. That, and the Doona stroller. I\u2019d kind of forgotten that there are smaller options until you mentioned it, lol!", "Okay, whatever makes you feel better, buddy."]}
