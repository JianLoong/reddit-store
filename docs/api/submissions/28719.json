We have 2 kids together (10 & 8).  We live about 30-minutes apart and have split custody but the kids live with me primarily during the school year because I live in a much better school district.  The kids spend 3 weekends a month with their mom during this time.  My ex and I co-parent pretty well in my opinion and usually get along fine.  \n\nMy ex remarried a little over a year after our divorce and has 3-year-old twins with her new husband.  She also now has 2 step-kids (13 & 11) as well.  So when my kids are visiting their mom, there are 6 kids in the house.  My kids hate it because they never truly feel like they are \"at home\" there because their mom's attention is divided so much between all the kids, especially their young half-siblings.  They tell me that they never do any activities when they are there, they pretty much always just stick around the house because it's so much work for my ex and her husband to handle that many kids.  \n\nSo, I make it a point to do something fun the one weekend a month I have my kids at home.  Camping, sporting events, museums, zoos, fairs, festivals, etc.  My kids and I really look forward to planning and doing these things together.  \n\nMy ex has started asking me if it would be possible to include her step-kids in some of these activities because they are getting jealous of all the fun things my kids are doing.  This turned into an argument recently because I told her to stop asking because I her step-kids are not my kids and I have zero desire to build any kind of relationship with them.  \n\nI told her that the only thing stopping her and her husband from doing fun things with the kids is themselves.  She told me it's a lot of work with 6 kids and I wouldn't understand.  I told her it was her choice to marry a man with kids and to have more kids herself and that isn't my problem.  She told me it would be fun bonding experiences for our kids and the step-kids and it would mean a lot to her if I would help her out with that.\n\nI told her that making her life easier is no longer something I am required to do and if she and her husband can't handle all the kids at the same time, then I am more than willing to revisit our custody agreement so I can have our kids more often if that would make her life easier.  That pissed her off and she called me an asshole for being petty about this.  \n\nI ended up telling my kids that they should try to refrain from telling their mom and step-siblings too much about the activities we do together.  They didn't really understand why because we've always told them that they can tell us anything, but I explained it to them the best I could.  \n\nI do feel bad about that part because I want them to know they can be honest with both their parents, but that seems to be the easiest way to keep the step-kids from getting jealous.

Pass on that mess, sounds like trouble waiting to happen.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, ex. I\u2019ll be sure to do that if *I* remarry and *I* have stepkids.\u201d", "OP, this is great advice in the case you have the revisit custody in court. Having proof she's overwhelmed and can't handle the kids during her weekends might help in getting full custody.", "Yes, it would be great if the kids could talk to their mom about fun things they do when the step-siblings aren't around to hear and get jealous.\n\nExcept, I'll bet that the kids get exactly zero time around their mom without the step-kids being present.\n\nNTA", "Wow. He must be a super-dad.", "That's the part I don't understand. 2 adults can't take 6 kids somewhere but 1 adult can take 4 kids somewhere. I don't understand why 1 parent take the twins while the other parent take the 4 older kids to do something.", "Two of em are 3\u2026 and if they do not feel comfortable at their mom\u2019s house I\u2019m gonna go out on a wimb and say they arnt exactly besties. Idk why you are getting downvoted because their is a slight chance that maybe they are friends and then yeah as long as ex pays and op\u2019s children really want them to come then yeah they should be included. But they probably arnt very close especially if they didn\u2019t grow up together", ">NTA, but I have a good friend who has included all of the half siblings and step siblings along with all of her grandchildren in every special event. \n\n\n\nGood for your friend. \n\n\n>Relax a little and try to include the children. It's not their fault.\n\nNo one said it was. Op has 2 kids. He has the bandwidth for his 2 kids. He doesn't want an extra 4 kids. He doesn't want to parent 6 kids. It is his choice and his right. \n\nBut good for your friend.", "Do you have basic reading comprehension skills?", "Some can and some can't. I'm strongly guessing ops ex is in the can't category \ud83d\ude02", "But that was her choice, she chose a man with children to marry and then she chose to have more children with him. Not of that is OPs fault or problem.", "What child support?", "The \"we need one/ some of our own\" is a very real thing. Never understood it either. Pretty poor reason to bring a life into the world, because you absolutely need to have one that is biologically both of yours.", "THIS. Why do these crazy parents who ask for this kind of stuff not consider the feelings of the kids?! Awkward as hell.", "NTA- so I\u2019m guessing ex wife and new husband aren\u2019t offering to pay for their two(and eventually four) kids to join you on these activities (Tickets,food)?\n\nAnd most importantly, do your kids actually even want their step siblings to join you guys?", "Right? If you have 6 kids, you plan for 6 kids. There is no magic entertainment fairy who is going to do it for you.", "Yeah, I meant the older ones- the steps, not the halfs. Not sure why I\u2019m being downvoted either- seems like asking your kids what they want when it\u2019s their activities is a pretty fundamental part of this\u2026 if the kids want it, then bringing two more along as friends every once in a while might be a viable compromise- IF the kids want them to come. I\u2019m literally just suggesting they be asked- not sure what\u2019s so objectionable about that!", "Cuz it would be fun for the kids. His kids.", "Exactly! Then they\u2019re mad at everyone else because it\u2019s expensive/too much work/ etc. \n\nWhen ex says it\u2019s too much work and OP doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 uh, yes he does. He didn\u2019t make any more so he can give time to the two he already has. NTA", "Right? And more often than not, they are under 30. Every time I read one of these, my mind boggles at the fact that people have married, divorced, remarried, and produced / become the stepparent of at least 6 kids - all before they turn 30.\n\nIt makes me wonder what I did with my 20s. Ah, the missed opportunities... /s", "Hmmmm...interesting expression.", "OP, please consider this. Go with warm persuasion with lots of sugar-coating, and when you have to shut down her absurd demands, do it in the same vein -- \"No, I wouldn't want to take away your time weekends where you can take care of just yours and your husband's kids. I know you're great with them and they need that time with extra focus from you.\" Or something like that.\n\nWhy do I say that? Because your eldest is withing shouting distance of 12, whereupon things are going to start changing a lot and at some point, though it may be a few years after that, this disappearing to another life most weekends may stop working for them entirely. What is the plan if they get into activities that need a serious commitment? What if they want to take advanced coursework -- will they have control of an uninterruptible study area in the other house? It's time to be thinking about these issues before they happen.\n\nPlus, with the level of entitlement to shoving off her childcare work onto others that your ex is showing, it's a concern that your two may be parentified into caring for the twins. \n\nHeading it all off starting now with the heavily diplomatic persuasion seems like the best option, since you don't want child support in exchange for more time and you're clearly devoted to doing your best for your children.", "not to mention liability issues that hopefully wouldn't arise, but, just in case", "Do they have zero maternal family?", "He already does fun with his kids...", "Exactly.  Why interfere with the bonding time OP has with his kids...and dilute it by spreading himself ghi n with the step kids. As such, they seem to get very little attention from the mom.\n\nOP. NTA.  Your kids need you more if fhegg are not gettjjng much quality time with the other parent. \n\nDon't dilute the fun times, activities. \n\nIt is extremely unfair of the ex to insist you help her.\nSohnds almost abusive.", "Is this a Yugioh reference", "Yeah. Odd since, it didn't quite work that way the fuurstbtime. Triumph of hope over experience.", "This is exactly what my parents did and they didn't parent us and instead tossed us to grandma. When she got sick and moved out, I turned into the live-in babysitter. No pay of course and no minding my schedule. Then divorced anyway. Some people are just not fit to have children nor do they deserve them.", "Right! I was wondering where are the late wife's family? Because It sounds like they have them full time and mayhap letting the children spend time with their maternal family can help ease up parenting 6 kids. If they make it a regular thing to have them spend time with their maternal family, alongside with OP taking his children part of the time, it'll be easier on everyone.", "Only on one weekend a month. Now he\u2019d get two", "Yes. Gather all 5 pieces (cards) of Exodia and you instantly win the game.", "Thanks. Too bad it usually only ever comes in handy helping others because it's hard to get my body and face to match my words.", "I never liked those 3 in1 options. They are big and bulky and I don't think that they are worth the money", "This made me laugh so much.", "Feel better about what?", "They\u2019re good for us, since our kids tend to be all over the place in height and it allows us to better customize for in-between heights/weights, instead of buying multiple seats. My five year old is the size of a toddler, for example, and my toddler is likely to be taller than her soon. The 3in1 can hold the toddler and act as a booster for the 5 year old, which is useful. \n\nThe 3in1 also offers a lot more support for our disabled daughter. Because it is booster height she can sit in it, but since it is also a full car seat she has the extra cushioning to help hold her in place.", "I'm glad those 3n1s work for people.  My disability makes those too difficult for me. Repositioning is especially difficult for me. Being able to go 3 across by not using them is like icing on the cake. But I'm glad there are options for everyone."]}
