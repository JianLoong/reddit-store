Your parents forfeited the privilege of attending your wedding when they refused to attend your beloved brother\u2019s wedding. This you did not engineer. You are taking both a moral stand and hypothetically,  practicing prudence that won\u2019t be necessary because your parents are not attending your wedding. Tell Your relatives that they brought this upon themselves. They can decide whether they wish to be childless or do the right thing and bring your brother back into their embrace. Doing so won\u2019t make them any less Christian. It might make them Christian because they are completely ignoring the teachings of Christ by erasing your brother from their lives.", "Well it's the consequence of their bigotry.", "NTA by a long shot, but you do need to keep us internet strangers updated on how this all shakes out!", "NTA. As for any family who are pressuring you to invite their parents, tell them that if that's how they feel, they will be uninvited, too.

Congratulations.", "NTA - hug your brother and have a great wedding day", "NTA, and also please tell them because they\u2019re oh-so Christian and conservative, that God created all people in His image, thereby any LGBTQ+ people were meant to be that way.\n\n(I myself am not religious but I remember reading the above somewhere and wonder how people can be so hateful while claiming faith in that religion)", "NTA do you think those same relatives have been expending that same energy on your parents to shame them for being neglectful homophobes?", "NTA!! In fact good for you for sticking up for your brother!", "Definitely NTA, as reiterated by every single commenter here. You are an amazing sister and person. \n\nSo I'm guessing that you are quite familiar with how judgmental devout Christians impose their will and values on others, no matter what anyone tells them (especially when they forbidden to do so). They force their way into situations that they have no business being a part of. Has the thought crossed your mind that there is a good chance your parents will crash the wedding and create a scene?\n\nI have a good contingency plan: Have 2 of your brother's gay friends (hopefully, ones who were invited to the wedding anyway) be the \"security team\" that is on the lookout for your parents. They can intercept any unwanted guests before they step foot in the venue. Preferably well built, capable young men. That would also provide peace of mind for all the welcome guests aware of the situation. \n\nYou've done a great job thus far, and it would be a tragedy if your parents showed up to air dirty laundry just to ruin your special day. Really, any of your or your husband friends could be the \"enforcers,\" but I find it most fitting if they were gay. \n\nJust something to ponder as I've seen spiteful exes show up to weddings just to cause trouble, and that tends to be the most noteworthy event that people remember. Definitely don't want something like that to unfold on your special day. \n\nCongratulations, and have a loose, fun-filled wedding day!", "OP you are wonderful.

You are NTA.", "NTA now that's a good sister.", "Tell them their son also deserved to have his parents at his wedding but they deprived him of that.  They did it to themselves.

If you (the flying monkeys) could please ask my parents why they didn't attend my brother's wedding and let me know, then I can make an informed decision.*\"\n\nThis would be my petty response.

It's a symptom of the problem: the hateful beliefs they hold and extend toward even their own child. And they've made no indication those beliefs have changed in any way.", "I agree.

You both deserve every happiness, and that includes not having to deal with your parents.", "I love that. And absolutely, replace your cousin.

You can support and choose him and have your parents there too. As adults you should all be able to be in a situation where your brother is 'safe' (inc emotionally) and has a great day AND you get them there too. You chat with him. See how he feels (whilst letting him know your his priority). It might not be a problem to him. If it is a problem for him then dont invite them. If he's comfortable with them being there, you could sit your parents down, tell them the rules and IF they promise to stick to them, they can come with maybe the threat of nc in the future if they break the rules.\n\n Its your family, you have a better idea how they ll behave than reddit. If you do invite them be prepared for things to go sideways, they surprised you before, so they might do it again. No one can blame you for not wanting them there. Being your parents doesn't mean that you have to have them in your life or in this case at your wedding. Its not like your fully cutting them off, your just saying these 2 parts of my life can't be together at the same time, so for my wedding which cant be split, I can only have one there and that's your brother. Future events can be split or had at different times, this cant. Please don't feel bad, life doesn't always turn out how we want it. In an ideal world your dad would have walked you down the aisle and mom could have helped you plan the wedding, and if that doesn't happen, it's because of their actions, not yours. for the record I say that as someone who has a great relationship with my parents so I'm not just jaded and think everyone should cut family out. \n\nAlso, your brother could defo walk you down the aisle", "Family is about who is there for you when you need them, regardless of genetics. \nIf 'family' is unwilling to be there for you and the people that you care about, and instead actively strives to make your lives more difficult, they don't then get to pull the family card and complain about things they feel they are entitled to.\nIf they acted like the family they claim to be, they wouldn't be hearing about your wedding after the fact. You shouldn't feel bad at all, they brought it on themselves by not being supportive of your family. \nYou should however feel good about standing in solidarity with your brother.", "There would be way too much drama if your parents were there and you don't want your brother to be uncomfortable."]}
