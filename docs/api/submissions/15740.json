You could 'teach' someone 'karma' by keying their car, but we derive more satisfaction from moral right-standing (or at least higher ground). When we determine that someone is behaving poorly and *warrants* pettiness, we often stoop to their level to show them the likely results of their actions. In this way, pettiness becomes an avenue to rechannel someone else's immature behavior back into the situation without presuming any additional responsibility on your part. Our excuse is often that they did it to themselves. In reality, It's not exactly \"what goes around comes around\" if sometimes we go out of our way to make it come back around. So essentially we like righting wrongs without feeling like we compromised our integrity; the acts of pettiness and malicious compliance are right on the cusp of what we might consider 'reasonably vindictive.'\n\nHowever, I ultimately think we like pettiness by its base definition because it either absolves us or distances us from our actions and their repercussions on others.
