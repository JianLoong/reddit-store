My cousin (19 F) is in college and is a few years older than me. She had some friends over that she knew from high school and I was happy to be included while they played games and watched movies. \n\nOne of my cousin\u2019s friends, Sarah (19 F), was really cute but was my cousin\u2019s age so she was out of my league. However, every time she sat down or bent over, I could see her underwear peeking out over her jeans. It was super obvious because she had on a white sweater, jeans, black underwear. There were about 10 teens hanging in the basement, including a good mix of guys she knew and some of my other male cousins, so I assumed she didn\u2019t want boys her age or younger seeing her underwear. \n\nWhen there was a break in the game, I very discreetly told her that she should pull her pants up because her underwear was showing in the back. She got angry at me and asked me why I was staring at her underwear. She even called me a sicko pervert. I was just trying to help her.\n\nI felt super awkward and distanced myself from the group while they started a new game. A few minutes later, my cousin came up to me and said \u201cI don\u2019t know what you said to Sarah, but you need to go upstairs with the parents.\u201d \n\nUp until that moment I thought we were having fun and hanging out with my cousins and some of her friends.

I didn't think people in the other classes heard me but ooh boy apparantly I was wrong. I was sent to the principal's office and I did get suspended for 3 days but I could tell he didn't want to and people were still talking about it when I got back to school. \n\nYOU did not do that, so in my view, you did fine and she was just embarrassed.", "This was almost 20 years ago, but I was hanging out with some female friends of mine, one of them was wearing a button up shirt. She was a bit on the.... busty side, and two of the buttons right at her chest had popped open, boobs were spilling out. I tried to get her to look down, and finally said quietly to her that she had a wardrobe malfunction she might want to address in the bathroom (figured she would go in, see herself in the mirror and realize what had happened). Both girls got pissed at me... I was so confused. Neither hung out with me much after that. \n\nI never understood what I had done wrong.", "I would have told her but put in also.

Tho as we all seem to agree, kind of understandable given the context. You didn't do anything wrong, you were discreet and to the point, but it is better to bring these things up with e.g. your cousin, who can pass it on. \n\nI was out hiking with male friend and female friend, who ended up with a little bit of period blood on her shorts. Male friend noticed first and asked me if I could let her know. poor guy was super embarrassed because he didn't want to shame anybody. but it was a good course of action.

That means you were LOOKING every time she bent over or sat down. It doesn't matter how obvious it is if you're looking \"every time\". \n\nFrom her perspective, a 16 year old just told her that he's been looking at her underwear all night, and that can make people uncomfortable. As soon as you mentioned it, the issue to her wasn't \"oh, my underwear are showing, I should fix that\", it was, \"oh, my friend's teenage cousin has been looking at my underwear all night, what the fuck\". This is most likely why she responded how she did and also why she had your cousin ask you to go upstairs - because now she knew you were looking (and probably would continue to do so). \n\nMost people would not be grateful when told this, especially not from a stranger in a room full of people. This is something a friend says when they go to the bathroom or something, not your friend's teenage cousin that you just met. \n\nYou're not an asshole for not knowing this, it's a learning experience.

I don't want to freak you out or anything, but the top of your unmentionables is showing.\"\n\nYou seem perplexed as to why this college girl did not want to discuss her underwear with a teen boy.

A grown man in the same situation would have been 100% an AH. OP thought he was doing the right thing, and his thought process reflects empathy and self-awareness, as do his responses to comments below. If Sarah had a stain on her shirt or something in her hair, this would have been a totally reasonable thing to point out (she may have still been angry though). OP just didn't know the lesson that we all learned when we watched some poor boy scout in the college dining hall get absolutely roasted because he thought he was being a \"gentleman\" by pointing out that a girl's thong was showing. For me, it was Ted Hertzberg junior year. \n\nOP, your heart was in the right place, but commenting on a woman's revealing clothing either makes you come off as a creep, or as the morality police.

It sounds like you may have also had an ulterior motive\u2014 you thought she\u2019d be thankful and maybe notice you after you helped her out of an embarrassing situation. It was never going to happen.\n\nShe definitely acted poorly, but I\u2019m sure she was embarrassed that some strange high schooler was staring at her underwear.

How many guys do you see with low hanging trousers or girls with bra straps showing. It's normal. Most people do not care if their underwear is slightly showing. Its really not a problem, unless you're at like a funeral. And you made it a problem by making a comment.\n\nIf you can see a chicks underwear, just appreciate the view, don't make a comment.

It was common, we all did this, and I even had friends who would ask opinions on patterns when we would shop at the mall because we all knew they would be seen.

He admitted he thought she was cute. And then he was focused on her butt. That would make any woman uncomfortable. It would make me very uncomfortable. I've had people talk with me about my bra straps slipping, and it is embarrassing.", "It isn\u2019t sexist. He said something he should not have because he didn\u2019t know better. This could have been, and should have been, a teachable moment where the cousin could explain that it is better to not say anything in those sorts of situations.", "Right, I was more responding to the commenter saying that you shouldn't tell a woman what to wear and the morality police point they made. I also doubt she was doing it on purpose, but if she was then she needs the morality police lol", "I don\u2019t think she was. OP said he only noticed when she was bending or sitting. Makes me think it was just her pants shifting through natural movement not a deliberate thing.", "And in the comments he explains there were other kids younger than him too and says in the main post there were other cousins the same age as him AND younger. IF and ONLY IF she was doing it on purpose than she's a huge perv.", "Yeah a very good way to convince a girl that you're not perving on her is to send her a link to the Reddit megathread you made about her underwear.", "I'd be peeved out even more and even more pissed off.", "Thanks I now know I behaved poorly and know better for next time", "Thanks! Definitely trying to learn from this. I\u2019m glad I posted because it honestly helped me work through some things that have been bothering me the last couple weeks during finals\n\nUnfortunately I think one of the reasons I told her that her underwear was showing was because I thought she might be appreciative of me telling her and notice me more. A couple people in this thread have pointed this out. That probably makes me more of an asshole, but I\u2019m now more knowledgeable about the situation and know that some of what I said and did was wrong", "but calling someone a perv if they notice how you intentionally dress is still an asshole thing to do.", "Then she shouldn't internally be showing her panties to a 16 yo. Either she's a hypocritical creep, or she blew up over nothing", "I approached a woman on a street to tell she has a roller in hair. She was grateful. It\u2019s about girl\u2019s immaturity. He was discreet", "Oh gosh, tell me if I have a witchy hair on my face, when my skirt gets tucked in underwear, if something is in my teeth and if I plumber's crack showing. Please don't shout, be discrete, I'll think fondly of you forever.", "This. It's a subtle but important difference. One thing is to bring the fact to her attention, and then leave it up to her to decide whether she acts on it or not; and the other is telling her to cover herself like she should be embarrassed that her underwear is showing. Maybe she wanted it to show, or maybe she doesn't care (I wouldn't, for example).", "She didn't tell him not to comment on it until after he had done it, it's not like he kept approaching her afterwards to remind her of it.", "This. One time at a concert I saw a woman with her long dress trapped in her frumpy undies. Luckily I can just amplify how gay I am to seem less threatening to women, and when I lisped to her about her dress being stuck in her underwear she was mostly shocked that she had zero idea. Then she was grateful.", "You're probably, chances are, not most 18-30yr old women though. Lesbehonest.", "The underwear or?", "NTA\n\n\"should\" is not a mistake in wording but tone and I suppose you didnt use a mil/lecturing parental but polite tone.\n\nBesides she is the a h here- either she didnt notice and doesnt want to admit or shows her underwear intentional and felt unpleasantly surprised that her exhibitionism could be interpreted as unawareness/stupidity. All options are equally bad loool.", "You can't have your cake and eat it too. Either he embarrasses her in front of everybody - which you were originally complaining about - or he does it discreetly, which you call creepy.", "And a white sweater.", "I can tell you it doesn't have a brown smear near the butt like yours.", "I think he just sounds young. \u201cI assumed she didn\u2019t want boys her age or younger seeing her underwear\u201d is almost cute how naive it is. I don\u2019t doubt that he was looking at her butt, but as a woman I\u2019ve always felt like as long as I\u2019m not being stared at or made uncomfortable, it\u2019s normal for people to look. He shouldn\u2019t tell women he isn\u2019t close with about clothing slips like that, it\u2019s a lesson he needs to learn but I think acting like he\u2019s being creepy or something is unnecessary.", "OP admitted in another comment that he never would have said this to a guy. How is that not sexist?", "I doubt she was either, I agree.", "Did you read the post? The cousin is not the person he made the comment to. FFS if you are going to attack someones idea at least read the post properly.", "It's ok, you did nothing wrong. You did a respectful thing and she caused the issue", "No worries!", "By telling her I mean telling her her underwear was showing not telling her she should pull her pants up. I know that was absolutely the wrong choice of words", "Because the girl WANTED her underwear to be advertised.", "One time I was wearing a new skirt for the first time and had a backpack on, and didn't realise my skirt had rolled up and my underwear was showing. I was walking down one of the busiest roads in the CBD in Sydney and some woman discretely told me that my underwear was showing.\n\nI was so grateful and apologised to her that she had to see that, haha.", "I fit in that age group and would also like to know if my pants were on show. However I'm extremely modest and would never wear low rise jeans.\n\nI agree maybe it is done on purpose. Perhaps OP taking her to one side to tell her, rather than singing \"I see (OP's , Cousin's, friend's) underpants\" was more undermining to her as it implied it was the WRONG thing to do, which maybe she thinks it is, but it is the trend and that is what embarrassed her.\n\nWho knows\n\nedit: Maybe it's manplainging (man explaining I can't spell it) literally who the hell knows. OP just ignore it and get over people are weird af", "Oh, great. Assuming that I'm a lesbian just because I would rather have someone tell me my underwear is hanging out? How conservative of you. \n\nNo, I'd say I'm in the majority. Most women I know would be mortified if their underwear was hanging out. \n\nBut please, Colin Robinson, keep being the internet troll you are.", "He shouldn\u2019t do anything at all. It\u2019s simple. Just be normal.", "Lmao your underwear  probably has a lot of cum stains", "I agree, but once you comment, it becomes creepy. Pointing out something about someone they didn't ask crosses so many boundaries, especially when you know the color of their underwear.", "Different but not sexist. OP does not understand how interactions between the opposite sex work. His cousin could have, and should have, corrected his behavior in a supportive way.", "Sorry dude, your suggestion is non-great.\n\nLike OP, you had good intentions but it was a bad idea.", "I think a more equivalent would be if your guy friends fly was down, would you tell them or not?", "A woman once did this for me too! I\u2019m forever grateful to her and thanked her profusely while trying to pull my dress out from under my backpack.", "There were more than a few girls growing up that loved to show their thongs and G-strings, but most that I know definitely hated their underwear showing. I'm definitely more conservative now than I used to be, I love my \"mom jeans,\" but I in no way dressed provocatively, I just couldn't find jeans at the time that weren't low-rise that didn't hurt my stomach. \n\nNow, the one thing that bothers me nowadays is people worrying about an underwear line showing through whatever they are wearing. I don't understand that at all. To me, it's just like, \"oh well.\" Because I'm dressing for comfort, not to be stylish. If you see my granny panty line, it's whatever.", "Normal people, decent ones anyway, let people know discreetly when there's something embarrassing going on with them, i.e. food in their teeth, toilet paper on their shoe, their underwear or butt crack hanging out. Not having the maturity to accept that someone noticed and wanted to save you from the embarrassment of continuing having said embarrassing issue on full display in front of everyone all day shows her lack of maturity, not his. I'm sure she would've been extremely embarrassed had she realized later that everyone just let her walk around with her panties out all night unless she's doing it on purpose, which would be HIGHLY inappropriate at a family gathering full of younger kids as well. Either she's the gross perv walking around at her friend's house whale tailing it on purpose, or she should've had the grace and maturity to accept someone letting her know she was accidently doing it and just pulled her damn pants up. Grow up if you think otherwise.", "Why is telling someone they might unintentionally be showing the room their underwear, \"abnormal?\" Personally, give me a guy secure enough, and enough of a gentleman, to tell me if I have a hole in my jeans, or started my period.", "Omg yesss. My bf points my big pant lines out in my jeans and I'm like. Don't bloody look then. I'm dressing for my comfort not yours. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That\u2019s just a different thing entirely. You can\u2019t just change the details of the story. This guy is 16 and she\u2019s 19 and mentioning that she\u2019s out of his league.", "So? Being out of his league means he shouldn't show respect for her?"]}
