My cousin (19 F) is in college and is a few years older than me. She had some friends over that she knew from high school and I was happy to be included while they played games and watched movies. \n\nOne of my cousin\u2019s friends, Sarah (19 F), was really cute but was my cousin\u2019s age so she was out of my league. However, every time she sat down or bent over, I could see her underwear peeking out over her jeans. It was super obvious because she had on a white sweater, jeans, black underwear. There were about 10 teens hanging in the basement, including a good mix of guys she knew and some of my other male cousins, so I assumed she didn\u2019t want boys her age or younger seeing her underwear. \n\nWhen there was a break in the game, I very discreetly told her that she should pull her pants up because her underwear was showing in the back. She got angry at me and asked me why I was staring at her underwear. She even called me a sicko pervert. I was just trying to help her.\n\nI felt super awkward and distanced myself from the group while they started a new game. A few minutes later, my cousin came up to me and said \u201cI don\u2019t know what you said to Sarah, but you need to go upstairs with the parents.\u201d \n\nUp until that moment I thought we were having fun and hanging out with my cousins and some of her friends.

I didn't think people in the other classes heard me but ooh boy apparantly I was wrong. I was sent to the principal's office and I did get suspended for 3 days but I could tell he didn't want to and people were still talking about it when I got back to school. \n\nYOU did not do that, so in my view, you did fine and she was just embarrassed.", "This was almost 20 years ago, but I was hanging out with some female friends of mine, one of them was wearing a button up shirt. She was a bit on the.... busty side, and two of the buttons right at her chest had popped open, boobs were spilling out. I tried to get her to look down, and finally said quietly to her that she had a wardrobe malfunction she might want to address in the bathroom (figured she would go in, see herself in the mirror and realize what had happened). Both girls got pissed at me... I was so confused. Neither hung out with me much after that. \n\nI never understood what I had done wrong.", "I would have told her but put in also.

Tho as we all seem to agree, kind of understandable given the context. You didn't do anything wrong, you were discreet and to the point, but it is better to bring these things up with e.g. your cousin, who can pass it on. \n\nI was out hiking with male friend and female friend, who ended up with a little bit of period blood on her shorts. Male friend noticed first and asked me if I could let her know. poor guy was super embarrassed because he didn't want to shame anybody. but it was a good course of action.

That means you were LOOKING every time she bent over or sat down. It doesn't matter how obvious it is if you're looking \"every time\". \n\nFrom her perspective, a 16 year old just told her that he's been looking at her underwear all night, and that can make people uncomfortable. As soon as you mentioned it, the issue to her wasn't \"oh, my underwear are showing, I should fix that\", it was, \"oh, my friend's teenage cousin has been looking at my underwear all night, what the fuck\". This is most likely why she responded how she did and also why she had your cousin ask you to go upstairs - because now she knew you were looking (and probably would continue to do so). \n\nMost people would not be grateful when told this, especially not from a stranger in a room full of people. This is something a friend says when they go to the bathroom or something, not your friend's teenage cousin that you just met. \n\nYou're not an asshole for not knowing this, it's a learning experience.

I don't want to freak you out or anything, but the top of your unmentionables is showing.\"\n\nYou seem perplexed as to why this college girl did not want to discuss her underwear with a teen boy.

A grown man in the same situation would have been 100% an AH. OP thought he was doing the right thing, and his thought process reflects empathy and self-awareness, as do his responses to comments below. If Sarah had a stain on her shirt or something in her hair, this would have been a totally reasonable thing to point out (she may have still been angry though). OP just didn't know the lesson that we all learned when we watched some poor boy scout in the college dining hall get absolutely roasted because he thought he was being a \"gentleman\" by pointing out that a girl's thong was showing. For me, it was Ted Hertzberg junior year. \n\nOP, your heart was in the right place, but commenting on a woman's revealing clothing either makes you come off as a creep, or as the morality police.

It sounds like you may have also had an ulterior motive\u2014 you thought she\u2019d be thankful and maybe notice you after you helped her out of an embarrassing situation. It was never going to happen.\n\nShe definitely acted poorly, but I\u2019m sure she was embarrassed that some strange high schooler was staring at her underwear.

She chose to make a scene of it", "NAH, take this as a learning experience. \n\nHaving underwear on show is not weird. How many guys do you see with low hanging trousers or girls with bra straps showing. It's normal. Most people do not care if their underwear is slightly showing. Its really not a problem, unless you're at like a funeral. And you made it a problem by making a comment.\n\nIf you can see a chicks underwear, just appreciate the view, don't make a comment.

It was common, we all did this, and I even had friends who would ask opinions on patterns when we would shop at the mall because we all knew they would be seen.

Said it privately like OP did.\nI'm not sure if you were trying to say that OP shouldn't have tried to say anything, or if you're saying bra straps are inappropriate, or if you were just only saying that hair rollers and underwear aren't the same? But I think if someone had a hair roller in their hair and didnt know and you told them, it would still have about the same if only slightly less of an embarrassment to grateful ratio as underwear. Whereas a bra strap does not unless that specific person finds it personally embarrassing which, where I'm from is like a near 0-1% chance.", "I can\u2019t think of any generation where a man commenting on a woman\u2019s undergarments was acceptable. Can you imagine a man doing that in the 50\u2019s? He would get slapped lol", "Lol yes, I\u2019m checking myself into the mental hospital asap", "Judgy much?", "[removed]", "I've had one of my female coworkers tell me on the sales floor. She was discreet as well. Could have saved me from a counseling statement.", "It is absolutely and always the right thing to do.", "I see men\u2019s underwear all the time in public, same with women\u2019s. It\u2019s straight up weirdo behavior to comment on it. If I see a woman who isn\u2019t wearing a bra I absolutely would not go up and tell her her nipples were showing. Low rise jeans and sheer tops are trends that absolutely show your underwear and it would be super weird to comment on it. Literally just mind your business, this isn\u2019t a 50 year old lady with her skirt caught in her pantyhose, is a 19 year old with her panties peeking out of the back of her pants.", "But he didn\u2019t comment on her undergarments, he let her know he could see them! Discreetly at that!", "Not as judgey as the person assuming OP is a creep for trying to let someone know their ass is hanging out!", "[removed]", "For sure. I\u2019m a perfect world maybe we could always be discreet when telling people, but oftentimes you can\u2019t be that discreet.\n\nI had to tell a fellow woman coworker about a fly that was down the other day in front of another coworker, because it was bad enough that it wasn\u2019t something that could wait, and my office is crowded so it\u2019s hard to catch people alone. \n\nPlus, clients likely would\u2019ve seen it if it wasn\u2019t addressed asap. We were already visible to clients as things were (glass wall). She jokingly berated our guy coworker we were talking to for not pointing it out afterwards."]}
