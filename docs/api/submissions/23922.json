My husband (36M) knows this and always encourages me to break out of my shell and be myself and create new friends. I do just that, now he\u2019s accusing me of cheating.  I\u2019ve never cheated with my husband, EVER.\n\nMy friend Sam (M) I just met about 8 months ago at work. He\u2019s funny, caring, everything you\u2019d want in an overall friend. I don\u2019t find him attractive at all from a relationship standpoint, for context. I\u2019ve hung out with him and another friend, Cara(F) many times after work. My husband sat me down last night and accused me of cheating because I went to look at cars at a dealership with Sam; we are both on the market for a new car. Husband didn\u2019t like that it was just him and I. Even got to the point where he tracked my location on my phone and watched the Ring  footage to see who\u2019s car I was going into. Husband has met Sam before and they hit it off pretty well, which makes this whole thing it\u2019s cause idk what got into him. \n\nSam is my #1 best friend on Snapchat and I don\u2019t know how. We snap 2-3 times a day, mostly just pictures of the floor and wall. Husband doesn\u2019t like that it\u2019s not him instead. He told me this last night when he sat me down and explained that I\u2019m not allowed to hang out with single guys, especially alone, because \u201cI know how they are\u201d. I told him I\u2019m able to be friends with whoever I want to be and if I saw any signs of them wanting to make a move, I\u2019d obviously end it right then and there and block them for good.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I only put a brief description of Sam in here to give fellow readers an idea of who he is as a person/nothing negative to present to the table because I haven\u2019t noticed anything bad or sketchy happen within our friendship. I am not attracted to Sam in any way, shape or form. \n\nEdit #2: I am now at work and cannot reply, but I appreciate everyone\u2019s input. Sometimes I just need an outsiders perspective. I\u2019m going to self reflect and take advice that was given. Thank you all for helping :)\n\nLast edit #3.

She might not be interested, but he sure is. The pictures of the floor aren't pictures of the floor. It is him gauging interest based on how much attention she is willing to give him over pointless messages that normal people would just ignore. Same kind of behavior smitten kittens showed before the internet,  and on every minor or major social network ever since. Remember that person who insisted you check out their MySpace top 8 so you can see they have you in there? Or that person who kept posting \"haha totally random\" stuff on your Facebook wall but never texts? It's gauging interest without the risk of going all in and ruining the groundwork they've laid and any lower level connection theyve built. If they interact, you have an answer.

My husband can't be the only meaningful relationship in my life. I know it because we have been together for 23 years. I've also known my best friends most of that time. When I'm stressed out he often suggests that I do something with them. Because it is healthy to have friends. Same for him. We realised it already when we were young.

I have! It happens all the time. People begin to feel as though their needs aren't being met, and they seek fulfillment elsewhere instead of communicating.

I don't think meeting at 26 and 36 is necessarily a red flag, since 26yos tend to have a firmer foundation of independence and interpersonal dynamics among adults at that point, so that's when I think it would come down to the personalities involved.", "No one's infantilizing, you gotta be real fucking dense to not recognize the experience differences between someone in their 20s and 30s, that's like their entire adult life. These loser men aren't able to find someone their own age so they leverage their experience and maturity (haha) - usually, it's earning potential duh everyone looks more successful when they're in their 30s.

Do you want them to chat on Facebook messenger?", "Absolutely,then we agree", "So if the age gap was only a couple of years it would make it somehow better to you?", "Bro, the OP and her husband are a married couple, and are in the 25-35 age range.\n\nThey're not single young adults. How dense can you be? Do you really not see the differnce or ANY issue with a committed partner using a texting app that was specifically designed for sexting and hiding messages with another guy?", "Dude, I said that it\u2019s very possible that they met *prior to marriage*. Making her younger than 26. As OP commented, they got together at 21 and 31.", "No. Controlling behaviors are red flags on their own. The age gap in this instance is another red flag, concerning the fact that they got together when she was 21, according to OPs own comment.\n\nBe it two flags or one flags, neither is a good situation to be in."]}
