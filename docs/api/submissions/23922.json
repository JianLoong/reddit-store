My husband (36M) knows this and always encourages me to break out of my shell and be myself and create new friends. I do just that, now he\u2019s accusing me of cheating.  I\u2019ve never cheated with my husband, EVER.\n\nMy friend Sam (M) I just met about 8 months ago at work. He\u2019s funny, caring, everything you\u2019d want in an overall friend. I don\u2019t find him attractive at all from a relationship standpoint, for context. I\u2019ve hung out with him and another friend, Cara(F) many times after work. My husband sat me down last night and accused me of cheating because I went to look at cars at a dealership with Sam; we are both on the market for a new car. Husband didn\u2019t like that it was just him and I. Even got to the point where he tracked my location on my phone and watched the Ring  footage to see who\u2019s car I was going into. Husband has met Sam before and they hit it off pretty well, which makes this whole thing it\u2019s cause idk what got into him. \n\nSam is my #1 best friend on Snapchat and I don\u2019t know how. We snap 2-3 times a day, mostly just pictures of the floor and wall. Husband doesn\u2019t like that it\u2019s not him instead. He told me this last night when he sat me down and explained that I\u2019m not allowed to hang out with single guys, especially alone, because \u201cI know how they are\u201d. I told him I\u2019m able to be friends with whoever I want to be and if I saw any signs of them wanting to make a move, I\u2019d obviously end it right then and there and block them for good.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I only put a brief description of Sam in here to give fellow readers an idea of who he is as a person/nothing negative to present to the table because I haven\u2019t noticed anything bad or sketchy happen within our friendship. I am not attracted to Sam in any way, shape or form. \n\nEdit #2: I am now at work and cannot reply, but I appreciate everyone\u2019s input. Sometimes I just need an outsiders perspective. I\u2019m going to self reflect and take advice that was given. Thank you all for helping :)\n\nLast edit #3.

Likewise, a lot of my friends over the years have been men, and married men are often easier to get close to, since they've already have someone in their life filling their need for romance, so the budding friend relationship has clear boundaries and doesn't have to deal with all that nonsense getting in the way.\n\nPeople who think opposite gender close friendships are weird or suspicious make the world a colder, sadder place.", "Yep, there is a reason 'the guy she told you not to worry about' is a meme.
