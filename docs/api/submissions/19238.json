It was returned after my nephew refused to build it with his profoundly mentally disabled sister.", "selftext": "My family and my brother's family visited my parents at their vacation house for Memorial Day weekend. There, I noticed that my normally energetic nephew (14M) seemed very upset at something. I pulled him aside and asked him if there was anything wrong.\n\nHe told me that his parents promised to buy him the Lego Roman Colosseum (nephew is a HUGE ancient history buff) if he did well in school. But when the package arrived, they said that he should be a good brother let his sister (11F) help. My nephew told them that having his sister help was pointless since she's completely nonverbal and has a habit of kicking things when she gets upset. As a result, my nephew had his lego set returned for talking back and being disrespectful.\n\nAfter we went back home, I asked my brother if what my nephew said was true. He said that it was. I then asked if my nephew said anything (e.g., calling his sister a vegetable) beyond calling the idea of letting his sister help ridiculous. He said no.\n\nI told my husband that I'm seriously considering buying my nephew the Lego Roman Colosseum for his upcoming birthday in August, as my brother and SIL were being completely ridiculous. My husband agreed that my brother and SIL were being ridiculous, but did not like the idea of me replacing the returned Lego set. He said that I would be undermining their parenting and provoking an unneeded conflict between our two families.", "created_utc": 1686171828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143oyb6/wibta_if_i_go_around_my_brother_and_sil_and_buy/", "score": 5058, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In that future time it may also open the door to a heart to heart conversation about not agreeing with his parents, but recognizing they were acting out of denial of a painful reality. \n\nUnfortunately, from what you\u2019ve described, your nephew will probably be estranged from his parents in the future. I\u2019ve seen similar situations in a friend\u2019s family and it (the denial of disability)ultimately damaged the family. \n\nBut your husband is right. YWBTA if you intervene now.

Perhaps mention to your brother that you see your nephews point of view and suggest that your nephew be allowed to build the Lego Roman Colosseum on his own and that they purchase another, perhaps more simple, Lego set that he can build with his sister.

You should tell them that they are being completely unfair because they made a deal, then changed it and punished your nephew over nothing.

Do you live close?  Does he goes to his grandparents often?\n\nI think you might just risk his parents taking it away from him.  They are being the AHs here.", "NTA This lego set might be discontinued in the future so  if it is within your budget, buying it for him would be such a wonderful and thoughtful thing to do.

Also your brother and SIL are unhinged and control freaks.", "NTA, but I'd get a big Duplo or basic Lego set (depending on your niece's cognitive age level) for the kids to play with together. Discuss it with your brother first, though. Nephew can build things with the basic set with niece, and keep the higher-level set in his room. Everyone wins.", "As a special needs parent I could never do what your brother has done. Maybe a work around would be to buy the colosseum for your nephew and get a separate more developmentally appropriate for your niece and they can do them together but separately? I suggest this bc a lot of the more complicated Lego sets are hard for typical people to put together let alone special needs people between the size/fragility of the pieces and the frustration of trying to get them together. My sons OT got my son a larger set of legos (not duplo but also not an intricate set) and he loves using them but can\u2019t grasp the regular sized legos properly yet.\n\nNTA btw. But if you do decide to buy it keep it at your house and give it to him when he\u2019s moved out and can\u2019t be punished for anything ridiculous like this situation", "This sucks! I bet his sister did nothing to earn the legos. And I am sure your nephew isn\u2019t interested in any of her things. I am team buy him something close to the set he wanted, him the set an invite him to come for the weekend(maybe he weeds or something to earn it, nothing big just 30 minutes of work) or buy and hide it for his 18 birthday.

I think we see this a lot with families that have blended families of able bodied and impaired kids.   Those sets are designed for older builders and an 11 year old non-verbal child is not the kind of person who should be building that kind of set.   These kids deserve the opportunity to be part of things but I think sometimes parents set unrealistic expectations under the guise of being equal.  I almost guarantee that they don't see the additional therapy, parental commitments and other needs as part of that \"being equal\" equation.", "It\u2019s hard. I completely agree and understand with the undermining parent comment, however it\u2019s not good to force your neurotypical child to be sharing a task as fine and detailed as a Lego Colosseum with their sibling who won\u2019t be able to follow the instructions necessary and might hinder the progress I.e kicking it. It can become quite the burden if everything revolves around involving a sibling even in a completely neurotypical family. And from a small comment mentioned, there might be an already existing pressure for things to be constantly revolved around his sister.\n\nI think as suggested a few times, buying it and keeping at your house as activity when your nephew visits, or talk more with your brother and sil about the reasons why you\u2019re considering this unfair and want to get it for your nephew to avoid undermining them completely. \n\nSo probably NTA", "Better idea: ask if the kid wants to come hang out at your house for a day for his b-day and give him the lego set where he can build it without interference.\n\nMy husband grew up having to always let his mentally disabled sister tag along and do everything with him and it just caused him to resent her. This kid could really use some space and time.\n\nEdit to add: YWBTA but you wouldn't be the *biggest* asshole in all of this.

There is no reason to think the result of his being given this Lego set will be different than the last time.

I suspect they will throw it away if they can\u2019t return it. \n\nYou will be showing your brother and his wife that you don\u2019t approve of how they parent their children.

If you get it they\u2019ll be mad they\u2019ll let the little girl smash it. Maybe just a special thing to have with you guys.", "YTA, it would only cause more stress on your nephew because they will still expect him to \"Share\" with her.

If possible, let him know that once he is 18 you can give him a safe place to live.", "Soft YWBTA because I agree they\u2019re being ridiculous, but you should think about how this might affect the son\u2019s birthday/happiness.\n\nAre there other sets that he would like as much that are history themed that you could get? I think that might be a more diplomatic route as 1) they probably wouldn\u2019t return your gift as it would be rude to you and not just the son; while 2) also not being a direct confrontation/undermining their parenting. It might ruin an otherwise happy birthday for the son if a present he gets from you causes more conflict.\n\nI don\u2019t care what your brother thinks, but don\u2019t try power plays that can backfire on the kid who just wants a Lego set.", "YWBTA for exactly the reasons your husband said.

I think at the end of the day you have to decide what your priority is, showing support to your nephew who is being treated unfairly or dealing with his parents being angry you went against their decision. Make sure you communicate with your husband no matter what you decide.", "NTA but you realize the parents won\u2019t let him keep it, right? I\u2019d discuss with them first.

Just tell them, \u201cI know how much he wants it so I\u2019d love to get it for him is that ok?\u201d  And good luck. \n\nMy daughter has autism and a mild intellectual disability. She gets very frustrated and upset with legos. We do use simple sets to help her with things like coordination, frustration tolerance, following direction, and focus.  But she does this with her therapist\u2026 they play games and build legos together to work on those skills. I wouldn\u2019t make my sons include her in their sets. It would just be frustrating for everyone. I feel bad for your nephew.\n\nPerhaps a middle ground would be to offer to get a second Lego set for the niece as well and offer to build with her so nephew can enjoy his in peace?

There, I noticed that my normally energetic nephew (14M) seemed very upset at something. I pulled him aside and asked him if there was anything wrong.\n\nHe told me that his parents promised to buy him the Lego Roman Colosseum (nephew is a HUGE ancient history buff) if he did well in school. But when the package arrived, they said that he should be a good brother let his sister help. My nephew told them that having his sister help was pointless since she's completely nonverbal and has a habit of kicking things when she gets upset. As a result, my nephew had his lego set returned for talking back and being disrespectful.\n\nAfter we went back home, I asked my brother if what my nephew said was true. He said that it was. I then asked if my nephew said anything (e.g., calling his sister a vegetable) beyond calling the idea of letting his sister help ridiculous. He said no.\n\nI told my husband that I'm seriously considering buying my nephew the Lego Roman Colosseum for his upcoming birthday in August, as my brother and SIL were being completely ridiculous. My husband agreed that my brother and SIL were being ridiculous, but did not like the idea of me replacing the returned Lego set. He said that I would be undermining their parenting and provoking an unneeded conflict between our two families.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Situations like this need to be looked at individually as there\u2019s no one way to go about ensuring disabled kids are included, sometimes pushing to include them in activities that aren\u2019t right for them makes things worse for them and everyone else (I say this from experience) and different solutions need to be put in place. \n\nI don\u2019t think buying the set would be wise, but not because the nephew necessarily did anything wrong.", ">I then asked if my nephew said anything (e.g., calling his sister a vegetable) beyond calling the idea of letting his sister help ridiculous.

I always told my kids they had to try it and if they really didn't like it, then that was fine.  So I told my niece to have 1 more bite and if she didn't want the rest that I would throw it away.  I still remember the huge smile she gave me.  She took one more tiny bite, told me she still didn't like it, so I tossed it and gave her something else to eat.\n\nMy brother came back upstairs as she was taking her plate to the sink and asked her if she ate her dinner.  She told him yes, because, technically she did.  Just not the food that he told her to eat.

Which should never include controlling the life of their other child.\n\n\nIf the parents said, \"[nephew], we want you to have POA (or guardianship) over [niece] after we are gone - could you please make the best decisions for her?\" - that would be something that can done from a distance (or a few visits a year) if the parents make the appropriate preparations.", "Often children living like this teenage boy end up with much higher roles and expectations for someone in their age group. They miss out during key stages of maturity and growth because they so often are responsible for the caretaking of a disabled human. It\u2019s a lot. He is also entitled to his own life even though his sister is disabled. I would probably flee the state asap if I knew I would provide free slave labor to my parents so they don\u2019t have to pay for it or do it themselves indefinitely.", "Surprise, not secret. It's not great to have children keep secrets.", "I read that with my stomach up in my throat. WTF. That is NOT good parenting.", "That last sentence is such an extreme version of what I assume is young, white, secular, middle class and above, American individualism. Tell me I\u2019m wrong? A great many societies and cultures have an ethos of duty to others, and it\u2019s considered clearly unethical to abandon one\u2019s duty to care. \u201cUnethical\u201d is very subjective. \nThe more collectivist cultures likely have fewer people who reach dizzying individual levels of success, but they also have fewer people dying of loneliness and neglect.", "Totally agree. We have engrained in our children the notion that adults should not ask kids to keep secrets.", "Exactly. Just so gross. Imagine turning to children you chose to have as back up care givers and telling them the main motivation for spending 1:1 time with them is so they don\u2019t resist being care givers for their disabled sibling. YUCK. We need hard lines about parentfication and IMO any parent that says this shit out loud in the vicinity of a mandatory reported needs to be put into parent re-education classes and kept a close eye on.", "I come from a collectivistic culture so I am INTIMATELY aware of how ideas of obligation, community and \u201cgreater good\u201d are used to manipulate the most vulnerable. While most of reddit fits your description it 1) doesn\u2019t represent all reddistors 2) doesn\u2019t represent all experiences or opinions globally and 3)we can criticize these socio-cultural expectations even in non western and no white non secular cultures if you didn\u2019t already know. Parentification  is child abuse. The obligations and sense of duty are meant to come from ADULT community members and not be expected from children still developing.", "A lot become wards of the state even with living parents and end up in group homes"]}
