My dad (56)  married a woman (37) with a son (16) about six months later.  I think that the age difference is a bit much but she is nearly 40 so it's not like he's robbing the cradle.  \n\nWhenever my parents went away I would always watch their dogs.  They weren't the dogs that I grew up with but they are good puppies. My mom would always call and let me know well in advance that they were going away ai I would make sure that either myself or my boyfriend would be around pretty quick after the pups got dropped off.  They could behave themselves for a few hours and I would leave water out for them.  \n\nI do not have any pets myself. My work can involve travel and my boyfriend works out of town for two weeks and then has two weeks off. \n\nWell my dad and his new wife decided to go on a trip.  But since it was never his responsibility he didn't call.  I was out of town. My boyfriend was working.  My dad has a key to my house for emergencies and dropping off the dogs. \n\nMy neighbor called me a day later about the dogs howling in my house to see if everything was okay.  \n\nI called my dad and he told me that he didn't know I was out of town. I said that if he didn't come get them I was calling animal control. So he had his new stepson come to my house to get the dogs. I have no idea why a  16 year old kid who was trusted to stay home by himself could not just have watched the dogs in the first place.  \n\nWhen I got home I found a disaster area.  \n\nDog crap and piss everywhere.  \n\nI don't want to describe everything because it makes me angry.  \n\nTo get everything that could be cleaned done and to replace my boyfriend's leather recliner, which was old but also destroyed, cost about $7,000.  \n\nI told my dad I expected him to pay for everything.  He said that he would see if his homeowner's insurance would cover it.  They will but the deductible is a lot.  And his premiums will go up. \n\nSo he said that he would take care of it.  \n\nIt's been a few months and I am sick of waiting.  The limit for small claims court in my state is more than double what I want. So I am suing him.  \n\nHe was served and called me to complain.  He doesn't have the money because he just bought a new car. He bought the car after my house got destroyed.  I feel no pity.  \n\nBut his wife and him keep trying to talk me out of pursuing this. They said that my dad paid for a good chunk of my student debt and that I owe him.  \n\nHim and my mom did pay off about $10,000 of my student debt.  And I was grateful. It is one of the reasons I had no problem dog-sitting for free.  \n\nBut he says that if I take this money then he will not have money for things at his house.  \n\nHe isn't retired. And my mom had life insurance.", "created_utc": 1671363014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zowkx4/aita_for_suing_my_father_for_the_damage_done_to/", "score": 1418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had MONTHS to pay you back and instead bought a car? His negligence resulted in damage to your property. He should absolutely be paying for everything and his financial irresponsibility is not your problem.", "NTA - he entered your home without your permission and left his dogs unattended. You gave him an opportunity to pay for the damages and waited months for him to do it. It's only normal that you took the next step and sue. He bought a new car so he clearly has other priorities than paying you back. IMO paying you back will never be his priority. Keep suing.", "NTA. He abandoned his dogs in an empty house without food and water.  Or someone to walk them. He isn't just an AH he should be investigated for animal cruelty.", "NTA. This is the least he can do. He should be grateful to YOU for not reporting him for animal neglect and entering your home without permission.", "NTA.  Get reimbursed, get your keys back and never watch the dogs again.", "NTA.\n\nHis dogs were violated by him, and he violated your rights and boundaries and it\u2018s only common sense that he pays for the damage!", "NTA. He dumped his dogs without even speaking to you first. He should have had stepson look after them. If he can buy a new car he can pay for the damage. It sucks you have to sue, but he needs to face up to what he did.", "NTA. You're just trying to get what you're owed", "NTA\n\nIt looks like suing your dad it's the only way to have a refund. \n\nIf you backpedal, he will find new excuses not to pay for the damage that his irresponsible behaviour caused.", "NTA This is a direct result of his careless actions. \n\nYour actual costs and damages mean nothing to him; only the thought of his own loss of money and possessions does. His position boils down to you should suffer so I don't have to even though it's my fault and thus my responsibility. Why? because me not suffering is the most important thing here.", "NTA. He wasn't going to pay you back, and he caused the damages through his negligence. That's all there is to it.", "NTA\n\nYeah no it's not your fault your dad was a negligent pet owner and then financially irresponsible. He owes you for the damages, and he's had the opportunity to pay.", "NTA\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nPlease listen to somebody who's a little bit older than you....\n\n1.  Paying off student debt is a separate issue. If / when he ever brings it up again stop him in his tracks. You tell him that is a separate issue, that decision was made in the past between him and your mother, you are tremendously appreciative of it but has nothing to do with anything going on in your world today or in the future.\n\n2. Your father and new wife might never have an epiphany and see your side of this story. Rarely do people all of a sudden say oh I understand what you're saying and I'm so sorry because I was wrong. You have to accept that but you do not have to accept their behavior, nor do you have to marginalize yourself. What they did was absolutely wrong, any court of law is going to see the same thing, this was wrong and your father caused these damages therefore is legally responsible to fix the damages.\n\n3. Tell your father you love him however this topic is a very specific topic and you need to stay on topic. It was irresponsible to assume you or your boyfriend were home and able to take care of two dogs. You are happy to assist in the future when you can discuss in advance and confirm your availability, you care about these animals and don't want them to be distressed which in this case they very much were. Unfortunately because he did not ask in advance and made assumptions, the dog suffered tremendous stress and property was damaged, this is a result of his actions and therefore he has to fix the situation. Ask him why he feels it's reasonable for you to be out of pocket money, time and to have had your home disrespected this way, would he accept this behavior from you to him? He would not, actions have consequences, with an adult child and a 16-year-old stepchild your father has to understand actions have consequences and if he doesn't by now he's in for a lot of fun as the stepson grows up.\n\nStay on course, Do not let yourself get pulled into debates as to whether he can afford it or not, that's not part of the situation. Whether he bought a new car or not, not part of the situation, whether your mother left life insurance or not not part of the conversation, the conversation has to stay very focused on simply this, your father made a mistake, the mistake resulted in damages and the damages have to be corrected.", "NTA. 6 months after you mom died, that's soon. Regardless it was his responsibility and you gave him time and an amount. Heck it didn't even seem like he was willing to talk about a payment plan.  Also if they can afford a new car, why not pay for a kennel to keep the dogs while they are gone. Your mom must've done a lot for your dad too think stuff just went smoothly without asking.", "He doesn't care about the dogs enough to check they are safe for his trip. He didn't care enough to fix the subsequent damage and definitely wasn't going to pay you back. NTA. But proceed with caution, of course.", "NTA. Your father and his bride seem to have reverted to being irresponsible teen-agers, although that is a slander against responsible teens.  Those poor abandoned dogs, I hope they didn\u2019t go unfed and unwatered for days before your neighbors notified you.  Who cares if he doesn\u2019t have money for \u2018things\u2019 at his house? Your father needs to make right the destruction his negligence caused.", "NTA. Your dad is horribly rude and neglectful. No more dog sitting and collect your key back if you haven\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nSeems like this is the only way that you would get him to pay up.\n\nBe aware, if you stay on this road there\u2019s a good chance your relationship with your father will never be the same again. Factor in how much that is worth.", "NTA. He dont ask you first, after all he said he is gonna pay, but he use the money for a new car. \nNop, its all his fault. Please, change the Keys from your House and dont give to him a copy, and he can let his dogs in another place the Next time. \nYou don't own him nothing for the studen loans, people dont have right to do thinks for you and later ask for retribuci\u00f3n. No if you don't agreed first. \nKeep with the cort, he can sell the new car if he dont have the money", "NTA-he clearly prioritized a new car over fixing your home.  not only is he an irresponsible pet owner but has no respect for you and your bf.  don't drop the case but make sure you document all interactions and communications between him and his wife.  he should have taken care of the obligation like he said he would before making such a big purchase like this new car.  it is up to you if you wish to go NC or LC with him after you receive your payment in full as you are not important in his life and he has other priorities and you are not one of them.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. Guess what, your dad left all the interpersonal work to your mother. Now she's gone *it doesn't even occur to him* to check with you when he wants you to take care of his dogs. This is because, from his point of view, when they went on holiday they just turned up and dropped off the dogs. Bet he sat around during the holidays and food just appeared in front of him, and that he had no idea what was inside the presents you opened as a child. If this had happened while your mother was alive she would have made sure you'd been paid for your dad's mistake and your dad wouldn't have given it a second thought. \n\nYour dad, fast approaching 60, now has to learn that *he needs to take care of things himself*. His new wife clearly isn't following behind him smoothing over the waves he's made. He's had months to make it right. I'd put money on his excuse being \"you didn't remind me\". *That's not your job*. Tell them you'll drop it if they pay you. If they can't afford their new car they'll have to sell it.", "NTA.  And even if you win your lawsuit, you should change your locks immediately.", "NTA but think long and hard. Your relationship with your dad will be *over*.\n\nIf you're okay with that then go for it, you're entitled to try and get what you're owed especially when he said he'd take care of it then welched.\n\nBut there's a very likely chance things between you and your dad will never be okay again.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And that your mom died and left him a life insurance policy and he didn\u2019t give you anything from it but needs to keep all his money for his new family, that\u2019s seems awfully cold to me. He literally expects you to be available for his convenience at any time but the last kindness he can remember giving to his child whose mother just died is helping her get an education. That doesn\u2019t say much for him as a dad.", "I'm so sorry for your loss and I hope you're doing okay. You're not in the wrong whatsoever because it sounds like you're not going to get paid unless he is actively forced to do so. NTA", "NTA your Dad sounds irresponsible.", "NTA. He was really stupid to leave dogs at your house without even asking. He\u2019s not prioritizing paying for the damage. I hope you documented everything and have evidence because I think you will need it. If he got a new car since then he could afford it, he\u2019s choosing not to.

Oh and change ur locks.", "NTA and don\u2019t let him off. He bought a car because he thought you would just forget about it. And don\u2019t let the fact he helped with schooling guilt you out of it. \n\nYou\u2019ve dog sitter for them for free. You saved them years of fees they would have paid to have their dogs watched while travelling do I\u2019m sure it adds up. \n\nHe was irresponsible about leaving the dogs alone without ensuring their care and it\u2019s actually lucky a neighbour called you since this could have been so much worse for those poor dogs \n\nSuing is the only way he will ever see his fault in this", "NTA.

As if you don't have your own life going on? And the 16 year old definitely could have just watched the dogs from the get go.\nAgain, change the locks. Your dad and stepmom suck. If they didn't want to fork out 7K in damages, maybe don't drop off dogs unannounced or figure out different arrangements. He's a grown man who went on VACATION and then bought himself a new car?

He could have easily agreed to a payment plan.   \n\nHe never planned on paying you back.  And a 16 year old by themselves needed the dogs for comfort and company.

He created this problem for himself and was happy to put off fixing it until you got the court involved - I guarantee that if you didn\u2019t do that, he would\u2019ve just kept stringing you along and drawing this out as long as he could, IF he ever actually paid for it at all.
