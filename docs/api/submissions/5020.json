My dad (56)  married a woman (37) with a son (16) about six months later.  I think that the age difference is a bit much but she is nearly 40 so it's not like he's robbing the cradle.  \n\nWhenever my parents went away I would always watch their dogs.  They weren't the dogs that I grew up with but they are good puppies. My mom would always call and let me know well in advance that they were going away ai I would make sure that either myself or my boyfriend would be around pretty quick after the pups got dropped off.  They could behave themselves for a few hours and I would leave water out for them.  \n\nI do not have any pets myself. My work can involve travel and my boyfriend works out of town for two weeks and then has two weeks off. \n\nWell my dad and his new wife decided to go on a trip.  But since it was never his responsibility he didn't call.  I was out of town. My boyfriend was working.  My dad has a key to my house for emergencies and dropping off the dogs. \n\nMy neighbor called me a day later about the dogs howling in my house to see if everything was okay.  \n\nI called my dad and he told me that he didn't know I was out of town. I said that if he didn't come get them I was calling animal control. So he had his new stepson come to my house to get the dogs. I have no idea why a  16 year old kid who was trusted to stay home by himself could not just have watched the dogs in the first place.  \n\nWhen I got home I found a disaster area.  \n\nDog crap and piss everywhere.  \n\nI don't want to describe everything because it makes me angry.  \n\nTo get everything that could be cleaned done and to replace my boyfriend's leather recliner, which was old but also destroyed, cost about $7,000.  \n\nI told my dad I expected him to pay for everything.  He said that he would see if his homeowner's insurance would cover it.  They will but the deductible is a lot.  And his premiums will go up. \n\nSo he said that he would take care of it.  \n\nIt's been a few months and I am sick of waiting.  The limit for small claims court in my state is more than double what I want. So I am suing him.  \n\nHe was served and called me to complain.  He doesn't have the money because he just bought a new car. He bought the car after my house got destroyed.  I feel no pity.  \n\nBut his wife and him keep trying to talk me out of pursuing this. They said that my dad paid for a good chunk of my student debt and that I owe him.  \n\nHim and my mom did pay off about $10,000 of my student debt.  And I was grateful. It is one of the reasons I had no problem dog-sitting for free.  \n\nBut he says that if I take this money then he will not have money for things at his house.  \n\nHe isn't retired. And my mom had life insurance.", "created_utc": 1671363014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zowkx4/aita_for_suing_my_father_for_the_damage_done_to/", "score": 5159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had MONTHS to pay you back and instead bought a car? His negligence resulted in damage to your property. He should absolutely be paying for everything and his financial irresponsibility is not your problem.", "NTA - he entered your home without your permission and left his dogs unattended. You gave him an opportunity to pay for the damages and waited months for him to do it. It's only normal that you took the next step and sue. He bought a new car so he clearly has other priorities than paying you back. IMO paying you back will never be his priority. Keep suing.", "NTA. He abandoned his dogs in an empty house without food and water.  Or someone to walk them. He isn't just an AH he should be investigated for animal cruelty.", "NTA. This is the least he can do. He should be grateful to YOU for not reporting him for animal neglect and entering your home without permission.", "NTA.  Get reimbursed, get your keys back and never watch the dogs again.", "NTA.\n\nHis dogs were violated by him, and he violated your rights and boundaries and it\u2018s only common sense that he pays for the damage!", "NTA. He dumped his dogs without even speaking to you first. He should have had stepson look after them. If he can buy a new car he can pay for the damage. It sucks you have to sue, but he needs to face up to what he did.", "NTA. You're just trying to get what you're owed", "NTA\n\nIt looks like suing your dad it's the only way to have a refund. \n\nIf you backpedal, he will find new excuses not to pay for the damage that his irresponsible behaviour caused.", "NTA This is a direct result of his careless actions. \n\nYour actual costs and damages mean nothing to him; only the thought of his own loss of money and possessions does. His position boils down to you should suffer so I don't have to even though it's my fault and thus my responsibility. Why? because me not suffering is the most important thing here.", "NTA. He wasn't going to pay you back, and he caused the damages through his negligence. That's all there is to it.", "NTA\n\nYeah no it's not your fault your dad was a negligent pet owner and then financially irresponsible. He owes you for the damages, and he's had the opportunity to pay.", "NTA\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nPlease listen to somebody who's a little bit older than you....\n\n1.  Paying off student debt is a separate issue. If / when he ever brings it up again stop him in his tracks. You tell him that is a separate issue, that decision was made in the past between him and your mother, you are tremendously appreciative of it but has nothing to do with anything going on in your world today or in the future.\n\n2. Your father and new wife might never have an epiphany and see your side of this story. Rarely do people all of a sudden say oh I understand what you're saying and I'm so sorry because I was wrong. You have to accept that but you do not have to accept their behavior, nor do you have to marginalize yourself. What they did was absolutely wrong, any court of law is going to see the same thing, this was wrong and your father caused these damages therefore is legally responsible to fix the damages.\n\n3. Tell your father you love him however this topic is a very specific topic and you need to stay on topic. It was irresponsible to assume you or your boyfriend were home and able to take care of two dogs. You are happy to assist in the future when you can discuss in advance and confirm your availability, you care about these animals and don't want them to be distressed which in this case they very much were. Unfortunately because he did not ask in advance and made assumptions, the dog suffered tremendous stress and property was damaged, this is a result of his actions and therefore he has to fix the situation. Ask him why he feels it's reasonable for you to be out of pocket money, time and to have had your home disrespected this way, would he accept this behavior from you to him? He would not, actions have consequences, with an adult child and a 16-year-old stepchild your father has to understand actions have consequences and if he doesn't by now he's in for a lot of fun as the stepson grows up.\n\nStay on course, Do not let yourself get pulled into debates as to whether he can afford it or not, that's not part of the situation. Whether he bought a new car or not, not part of the situation, whether your mother left life insurance or not not part of the conversation, the conversation has to stay very focused on simply this, your father made a mistake, the mistake resulted in damages and the damages have to be corrected.", "NTA. 6 months after you mom died, that's soon. Regardless it was his responsibility and you gave him time and an amount. Heck it didn't even seem like he was willing to talk about a payment plan.  Also if they can afford a new car, why not pay for a kennel to keep the dogs while they are gone. Your mom must've done a lot for your dad too think stuff just went smoothly without asking.", "He doesn't care about the dogs enough to check they are safe for his trip. He didn't care enough to fix the subsequent damage and definitely wasn't going to pay you back. NTA. But proceed with caution, of course.", "NTA. Your father and his bride seem to have reverted to being irresponsible teen-agers, although that is a slander against responsible teens.  Those poor abandoned dogs, I hope they didn\u2019t go unfed and unwatered for days before your neighbors notified you.  Who cares if he doesn\u2019t have money for \u2018things\u2019 at his house? Your father needs to make right the destruction his negligence caused.", "NTA. Your dad is horribly rude and neglectful. No more dog sitting and collect your key back if you haven\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nSeems like this is the only way that you would get him to pay up.\n\nBe aware, if you stay on this road there\u2019s a good chance your relationship with your father will never be the same again. Factor in how much that is worth.", "NTA. He dont ask you first, after all he said he is gonna pay, but he use the money for a new car. \nNop, its all his fault. Please, change the Keys from your House and dont give to him a copy, and he can let his dogs in another place the Next time. \nYou don't own him nothing for the studen loans, people dont have right to do thinks for you and later ask for retribuci\u00f3n. No if you don't agreed first. \nKeep with the cort, he can sell the new car if he dont have the money", "NTA-he clearly prioritized a new car over fixing your home.  not only is he an irresponsible pet owner but has no respect for you and your bf.  don't drop the case but make sure you document all interactions and communications between him and his wife.  he should have taken care of the obligation like he said he would before making such a big purchase like this new car.  it is up to you if you wish to go NC or LC with him after you receive your payment in full as you are not important in his life and he has other priorities and you are not one of them.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. Guess what, your dad left all the interpersonal work to your mother. Now she's gone *it doesn't even occur to him* to check with you when he wants you to take care of his dogs. This is because, from his point of view, when they went on holiday they just turned up and dropped off the dogs. Bet he sat around during the holidays and food just appeared in front of him, and that he had no idea what was inside the presents you opened as a child. If this had happened while your mother was alive she would have made sure you'd been paid for your dad's mistake and your dad wouldn't have given it a second thought. \n\nYour dad, fast approaching 60, now has to learn that *he needs to take care of things himself*. His new wife clearly isn't following behind him smoothing over the waves he's made. He's had months to make it right. I'd put money on his excuse being \"you didn't remind me\". *That's not your job*. Tell them you'll drop it if they pay you. If they can't afford their new car they'll have to sell it.", "NTA.  And even if you win your lawsuit, you should change your locks immediately.", "NTA but think long and hard. Your relationship with your dad will be *over*.\n\nIf you're okay with that then go for it, you're entitled to try and get what you're owed especially when he said he'd take care of it then welched.\n\nBut there's a very likely chance things between you and your dad will never be okay again.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And that your mom died and left him a life insurance policy and he didn\u2019t give you anything from it but needs to keep all his money for his new family, that\u2019s seems awfully cold to me. He literally expects you to be available for his convenience at any time but the last kindness he can remember giving to his child whose mother just died is helping her get an education. That doesn\u2019t say much for him as a dad.", "I'm so sorry for your loss and I hope you're doing okay. You're not in the wrong whatsoever because it sounds like you're not going to get paid unless he is actively forced to do so. NTA", "NTA your Dad sounds irresponsible.", "NTA. He was really stupid to leave dogs at your house without even asking. He\u2019s not prioritizing paying for the damage. I hope you documented everything and have evidence because I think you will need it. If he got a new car since then he could afford it, he\u2019s choosing not to.

Oh and change ur locks.", "NTA and don\u2019t let him off. He bought a car because he thought you would just forget about it. And don\u2019t let the fact he helped with schooling guilt you out of it. \n\nYou\u2019ve dog sitter for them for free. You saved them years of fees they would have paid to have their dogs watched while travelling do I\u2019m sure it adds up. \n\nHe was irresponsible about leaving the dogs alone without ensuring their care and it\u2019s actually lucky a neighbour called you since this could have been so much worse for those poor dogs \n\nSuing is the only way he will ever see his fault in this", "NTA.

As if you don't have your own life going on? And the 16 year old definitely could have just watched the dogs from the get go.\nAgain, change the locks. Your dad and stepmom suck. If they didn't want to fork out 7K in damages, maybe don't drop off dogs unannounced or figure out different arrangements. He's a grown man who went on VACATION and then bought himself a new car?

He could have easily agreed to a payment plan.   \n\nHe never planned on paying you back.  And a 16 year old by themselves needed the dogs for comfort and company.

He created this problem for himself and was happy to put off fixing it until you got the court involved - I guarantee that if you didn\u2019t do that, he would\u2019ve just kept stringing you along and drawing this out as long as he could, IF he ever actually paid for it at all.

He wasn't a good father, but shorter times would have been appropriate", "Yep. People emancipate themselves at 16 because their parents suck. At 15, I was left for 2 weeks taking care of 3 kids under 10. Never said the kid wasn't capable, just said dad could have done better with the kid and the dogs.", "In mine they have to go to court and prove their parents suck first.", "Well yea, there's no respect. I get that the mom always did the call ahead to organize, but basic respect and decency says \"Hey, call ahead and confirm.\" If you have any knowledge or experience with *having an appointment* literally ever in your life, or take into consideration that both OP and their partner regularly travel for work, it's rather dumb, inconsiderate, and disrespectful to just be like \"Ahhh, they came out of my balls and I provided for their needs like I'm obligated to as a parent, so they can drop everything on no notice for me.\" \n\nThen the dogs that he placed in the house without the homeowners consent wrecked it. He is 100% liable and responsible. He's lucky OP didn't just call the damn cops. Depending on where they live, if he has a key he likely wouldn't see a break and enter charge, but he absolutely would have seen a destruction of property charge. \n\nOP, your Dad needs to get his head on straight. NTA.", "Never underestimate the stupidity of an entitled person, or just a genuinely stupid person. Though the potential he could destroy other things is also a reasonable concern.", "I totally agree with you but they trust stepson to be alone for a week and not to take care of \u00ab\u00a0his\u00a0\u00bb dogs is a little bit easy to me. Easy as they want so much theirs holidays that they cross fingers about dogs and child.", "That's actually completely normal. Any teenager with a job over summer will likely be left behind during every vacation or camping trip.", "Canadian here, too. I think a week is fine if it's a responsible kid. Every kid's different though, so obviously it depends.", "I left my just turned 17 year old at home for a week last summer, he drove himself to work, had dinner with his grandparents if he didn\u2019t want to cook, and didn\u2019t wreak the house.", "Yes, the kid should have been looking after the dogs.  A well-raised 16-year-old is eminently capable of looking after both themself and a couple of dogs for a couple of weeks.", "Oh God in heaven \ud83e\udd22", "I'm a Boomer, and yup, what's considered normal today looks look enormous social pressure to overprotect young adults. Individuals differ a lot, but there's nothing crazy about leaving a competent 16yo who is comfortable with it and has an adult they can call for backup if needed, for  week or two.\n\nOf course, it's not clear whether this 16yo had someone they can call.", "Left in charge three kids is a much bigger burden than just being asked to take care of yourself for that time.", "True. I lived within walking distance of my best friends house so if there was an emergency there were trusted adults close by and they had a guest room where I could crash.", "True, and totally don't think the kid is incapable. Just think the dad could be more responsible in general...dogs, kid, probably other things too.", "Sure but both are parents shirking their responsibility onto their kids.", "Correct. That is my point.", "For sure.", "If you are under 16, parents have to sign papers at the hospital. At least where I live. That's all I was referencing. I never, ever said the kid couldn't be trusted. Just saying dad sucks.\n\nEdit: Sorry,I meant to type 18.", "Never was talking about the kid's ability. I'm sure he's totally capable. Still doesn't make the dad a stellar parent or dog owner.", "Oh l am sure he could considering it didn\u2019t occur to him to do things like talk to OP before dropping the dogs off. My objection asks to the idea that a 16 year old taking care of themselves for a week is too much. Plenty of teens can handle it. And considering OPs dad, it might even be a relief for them as it sounds like dad is a self centered entitle AH.", "I don't really understand your point about paperwork? People under 18 go to the ER and receive treatment without their parents everyday. You don't wait for proper paperwork if someone needs immediate medical attention.", "NTA. He didn't even call to ask if you were home, or to check on his dog's after dropping them off. There was a 16 year old who could have kept them at their own house. He bought a car, knowing he should fix what he was responsible for. Your parents helping you with student loans has nothing to do with this present mess. Do not let them talk you out of this. It will set the future for them to screw you over again and again. I'm really sorry you're going thru this, it sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA he was never going to help you fix it.", "NTA but is the issue the $7000?  That seems kind of insane to me.  What was damaged besides a recliner?\n\nHow much crap and piss can 2 dogs do in one day?", "NTA", "NTA Thank goodness the neighbor called, the dogs could have died! Your dad was totally irresponsible, and should 100% cover your costs", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was doing when he left the dogs in the house. He is being immature and not wanting to take responsibility for the damage he has caused even after you told him that you were suing.", "NTA-- But, your Dad is! This is NOT Your problem!! Tell \"dear old Dad\" to pay up or continue on and take him to court!", "NTA. He cost you thousands in damages and than the emotional damage of dealing with it. And instead of paying you back he bought a car. Sounds like a them problem. \n\nSorry but your dad just proved to you that you are there for him to use and thats it. Listen to him.", "Not the a-hole. He should have called before hand, had the dogs stay with the step-son, or finally, paid for the damages before buying a new car. He is an a-hole for bringing up the student debt, that was a gift not a debt to cover damage to your home.", "NTA- Why on earth would he not check you were going to be home in time, even if he did think you were in town? It's a highly likely time of the year for going out for long periods, drinks after work etc.", "NTA. Your dad and his wife should've given you ample notice that they were going to drop off the dogs, they should've made sure someone was home to watch them when they came, and after the dogs destroyed your stuff, they should have reimbursed you ASAP instead of using the money to buy a new car. They screwed up on multiple levels here, and they should be held responsible for their actions.\n\nFurthermore, I don't like them trying to guilt you into dropping the suit with the student debt argument. Sure, it was nice of your parents to do that, and you're right to be grateful about that, but that means you owe him respect, not to look past $7,000 in repairs because he screwed up.", "Your father is an irresponsible asshole. Change the locks asap", "NTA. Your dad is a real piece of art. Marrying a woman close to his daughter in age, dropping his puppies without calling and now trying to guilt-trip you? And the icing on the cake is that a 16 year stepson could have watched the dogs anyway....you definitely should change the locks and go low contact.", "NTA: Parents paying for your student loans is not a must nor is it that needs paid back. They brought you into this world and if they decide to pay for student loans without a prior agreement ie \u201cpay this back or earn this back\u201d then I think you\u2019re in the clear. Sounds like Dad needs to mature a bit", "NTA and I'd make sure to ask for the spare key back because they don't remotely deserve it. Also what kind of asshole goes and picks up their dogs, sees dogshit and piss everywhere and does nothing to clean it up.\n\nYour dad just sounds like an asshole. They are working and have money, you pay debts before you buy luxury goods you don't need. They are stringing you along with stories of woe while saying they can't pay you yet spending thousands.", "NTA, $7k is cheap given the animal cruelty charge he dodged.", "NTA. 10k is a drop in the bucket for what parents pay towards their children\u2019s education. Don\u2019t let them guilt trip you for it.", "NTA on several levels.\n\n* He is fully responsible for the damage\n\n* He said he would pay\n\n* He was able to pay, but instead decided to buy a car", "He owes u. He literally committed b&e property damage.  Follow thrumwith the lawsuit until he pays up.", "YTA\n\nHow on earth could you sue your own father over $7K?\n\nEspecially since you fondly remember the $10K of student debt he helped you pay off.\n\nThen again, given your hyperlitigious and ungrateful personality, that was probably a court-ordered affair, too.\n\nOh well, he has no one to blame but himself.\n\nAfter all, what's that saying again?\n\nThe apple doesn't rot far from the tree.", "NTA. He should be charged for animal neglect, if your neighbours hadn\u2019t complained and you weren\u2019t due home for a while you could\u2019ve easily come home to dead dogs as well as even more a damage. I can\u2019t comprehend leaving my animals with someone and not asking for regular updates on how they\u2019re doing, let alone without even letting them know they\u2019re there..", "NTA. If I had just bought a car and owed someone a lot of money unexpectedly, I'd talk to them about it. I'd let them know what my financial situation was currently and see if we could work out a payment plan. Your dad took absolutely no responsibility anywhere along the way here. He was clearly hoping if he didn't mention it, it would all go away. His intentions weren't good. Don't let the $10,000 from the past make you feel guilty. Actions speak louder than words and your father was clearly ok with screwing you over.", "I think that it was Chris Rock who said it best regarding your dad paying some of your student debt.  \"I take care of my kids\". \"what do you want? A cookie?  You are supposed to take care of your kids you dumb MF\". NTA.", "He never intended on paying OP back. People that truly intend to pay you back will do it.", "I can't believe he didn't offer but then again I can because this sub. \n\nBut he really should have offered.", "All of this.\nAnd also, change your locks.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Totally his fault. Oh, and make damn sure you get that house key back or change the locks!", "> Stay on course, Do not let yourself get pulled into debates as to whether he can afford it or not, that's not part of the situation. \n\nThis.\n\n\"Dad, this isn't a negotiation.  You've been legally served and unless you want the added expense of a legal defense, you'll pay the $7k to fix what you broke because of your negligence.  End of story.\"", "They haven't normally lost one of their main caretakers and been moved into an entirely different family dynamic. I have a feeling the dogs have possibly been acting out of character since your mother's passing and the new marriage, and your father knew that things might not go well when he left them there. And there's no way the 16yo couldn't have watched them, your father just didn't want to impose on the new stepson or upset new wife, so you were there to make sure he didn't have to deal with any of that. At this point, I'm not sure I'd want to salvage this relationship, either.", "You have since changed your locks, right? So he can\u2019t come and go whenever the feels like? And you aren\u2019t dog sitting ever again?", "And? So, I\u2019d wager there are way higher odds on the kid spending way too much time playing video games and eating junk food over throwing a \u201890s teen movie worthy party with kegs, a live band in the living room, and someone puking in the pool.", "I was living by myself and working at 16.", "Just be sure to check professional reviews to see if they have any glaring flaws first!", "Unless he has some sort of dementia or brain damage.", "Walking into a house you expected to be empty and being presented with a disaster zone containing dog corpses is the definition of traumatizing.", "Yeah, it's possible I'm judging dad too harshly, but his actions with the dogs don't show he would make sure a family member was in town and available.", "Stellar parenting is not helicoptering over your kids until they are legal adults, yet completely helpless."]}
