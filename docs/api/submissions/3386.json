We were super excited to have our first thanksgiving dinner at home. Unfortunately neither sets of parents got the memo and expected us to come to them for thanksgiving. My family (who lives 3 hours away) decided to host thanksgiving dinner on Saturday since I still had work on Friday. I got up at 6am on Saturday morning so we could spend as much time together as possible before I had to drive back home on Sunday. My fianc\u00e9 had to work so he wasn\u2019t able to come with me, and since he works nights I had to bring our 6 month old Saint Bernard puppy with me as well\u2014so to me this was a lot of driving and a lot of work for a 24 hour long visit. I had discussed this with my parents ahead of time but they laid the guilt on so thick that I felt obligated to go.\n\nI get there and my mom mentions that she has been cutting back on her salt intake bc her blood pressure was a little high at her last physical. For context, my father has always had hypertension so my parents are already SUPER stingy on the salting/seasoning. I have vivid childhood memories of bursting into tears bc I used the salt shaker and my parents screamed their heads off like I was adding poison to my food. \n\nFast forward to dinner time. We sit down for thanksgiving dinner that I\u2019m driving 6 hours in 24 hours for and EVERYTHING is completely unseasoned. Saltless turkey, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese (from scratch so no added salt)\u2026seriously everything. It was so bland that even adding table salt/pepper didn\u2019t help. I kept my mouth shut bc I didn\u2019t want to be rude but I was PISSED and I\u2019m pretty sure she could tell. I barely ate my food after my mom spent the whole afternoon cooking. \n\nI feel like maybe I\u2019m being a food snob, but I also think it\u2019s really rude to invite people from out of town for thanksgiving dinner and then cook the entire dinner without salt bc you personally are cutting back on your salt intake.

While sodium certainly contributes to high blood pressure, the amount we add to food while cooking or at the table is approximately 10% of our total sodium consumption. The rest is inherently in the food or, more commonly, added to the food as a preservative by the manufacturers so it has a longer shelf life (ramen, for example, has truly horrifying amounts of sodium). Carefully selecting your food (by reading the labels for sodium content) at the grocery store is WAY more effective at managing blood pressure than getting rid of the salt shaker. They\u2019re actually kind of torturing themselves for a 10% reduction when they could achieve a 50%+ reduction by reading labels more carefully.\n\nUnless your parents have heart failure and genuinely need to keep to a consistently, extremely low sodium diet (and there is even some debate on if that is actually necessary for heart failure patients - European studies have shown that giving high amounts of intravenous sodium chloride just before a diuretic may be more effective at pulling off excess fluid than a sodium restriction), then adding a reasonable amount of salt to a SINGLE holiday meal is not going to seriously derail their blood pressure management. Worst case scenario would be slightly higher BP for a couple of days, which is not a big deal. With the exception of extreme hypertension (where the systolic - top number - is higher than 180 or so), single or short lived episodes of mildly high BP are not particularly dangerous, otherwise we\u2019d all drop dead from exercise, since our BP naturally goes up with exertion. It\u2019s the long-term high BP that causes all of the problems, so if your parents are consistently doing low sodium, then an occasional meal with normal sodium (by which I mean what the average person would consider normal, not what manufacturers might consider normal) will not cause any harm. \n\nAnd in conclusion\u2026if a person has a health condition that requires that food be made less palatable, perhaps they should not be hosting - and demanding attendance at - a meal?

You can use other spices and avoid salt. That is what we also do. I can't stand food that is salted or especially over salted. I have never had an unsalted meal that was bland and I personally use a variety of good and flavourful spices.", "You might be surprised at how some people are towards food that doesn't have much sodium in it.  I don't eat many high sodium meals normally and I've had plenty of really flavorful foods that don't have a lot of salt in the recipe but other people I know think they are towards the bland side of things.

Like, if anyone in my family decided to host ANY kind of meal and had people travel from all over just to get some unseasoned slop, they'll count themselves lucky if all they got were 10-20 people clowning them to their face. And trust me when I say even the kids would've ragged on them for that mess. And reducing salt truly is no excuse. My stepdad had a stroke because of his blood pressure so my mom started using less salt, too. There's no discernible difference in most things because she just adjusted the other seasons.
