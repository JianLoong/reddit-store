We were super excited to have our first thanksgiving dinner at home. Unfortunately neither sets of parents got the memo and expected us to come to them for thanksgiving. My family (who lives 3 hours away) decided to host thanksgiving dinner on Saturday since I still had work on Friday. I got up at 6am on Saturday morning so we could spend as much time together as possible before I had to drive back home on Sunday. My fianc\u00e9 had to work so he wasn\u2019t able to come with me, and since he works nights I had to bring our 6 month old Saint Bernard puppy with me as well\u2014so to me this was a lot of driving and a lot of work for a 24 hour long visit. I had discussed this with my parents ahead of time but they laid the guilt on so thick that I felt obligated to go.\n\nI get there and my mom mentions that she has been cutting back on her salt intake bc her blood pressure was a little high at her last physical. For context, my father has always had hypertension so my parents are already SUPER stingy on the salting/seasoning. I have vivid childhood memories of bursting into tears bc I used the salt shaker and my parents screamed their heads off like I was adding poison to my food. \n\nFast forward to dinner time. We sit down for thanksgiving dinner that I\u2019m driving 6 hours in 24 hours for and EVERYTHING is completely unseasoned. Saltless turkey, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese (from scratch so no added salt)\u2026seriously everything. It was so bland that even adding table salt/pepper didn\u2019t help. I kept my mouth shut bc I didn\u2019t want to be rude but I was PISSED and I\u2019m pretty sure she could tell. I barely ate my food after my mom spent the whole afternoon cooking. \n\nI feel like maybe I\u2019m being a food snob, but I also think it\u2019s really rude to invite people from out of town for thanksgiving dinner and then cook the entire dinner without salt bc you personally are cutting back on your salt intake.
