She sounds like a handful. And then wants you to do the work anyway. Don't apologize unless she apologizes for treated you poorly because your pregnant.", "NTA although you could have been more controlled in your reaction. \n\nShe basically kicked you out of their wedding party because your pregnant body would no longer fit her wedding aesthetic. But you would still be expected to spend time and money on her bridesmaids activities. I\u2019m not sure how she or brother can defend that.", "NTA - she kicked you out as a bridesmaid for being pregnant. That\u2019s messed up. She deserved it", "She was expecting a lot from you.  Too much.  Once you were \"demoted\", why didn't she lean on another bridesmaid?  Either she knows they are flakes or she thought you were a push over.\n\nThe next time your brother calls to complain about not helping with his wedding, ask him \"What's my husband's middle name?\"  or \"Who does my husband work for?\" or some other simple trivia to show that relationships need both parties to put in the work.\n\nNTA", "NTA and here\u2019s why- she kicked you out because you would be pregnant and not look good in the dress (in her opinion). Given what you\u2019ve said about her wanting a \u2018dream\u2019 wedding, I think she thought you would mess with her aesthetic. She didn\u2019t even try to find a dress that you might be comfortable in. On top of that, she said you could continue to \u2018help\u2019 with the BM stuff- what?? So you\u2019re not good enough to be a bridesmaid but your work is? You were cranky in your response but I would be too.", "NTA. Lol. Sounds like a win win to me.", "NTA. The SIL is a huge one and your brother too. This happening just further proved why you are not close to your brother. Glad you are considering not even attending the wedding. Save your time and money for you real family that matters.", "For you, the day you got married was the most important day of your life.

You for saying yes, when you wanted to say no from the beginning. You should have said no. You weren\u2019t being true to yourself or honest with them about your wants/needs. \n\nYour SIL is the biggest AH here, for casting you aside when you got pregnant because the dress would be too form fitting or whatever. But then also expecting you to do things for the wedding. That\u2019s very entitled and hurtful of her. \n\nYour brother is also an AH for demanding an apology over expressing yourself. Although I think you should have said no from the beginning, being honest and blunt wasn\u2019t the part that made you an AH and I think it\u2019s ridiculous that he\u2019d uninvite you if you don\u2019t apologize. That\u2019s controlling and manipulative behavior.", "NTA", "NTA your brother has to deal with her, you don't.  Tell the princess your not one of her loyal subjects.", "NTA and the uninvitation is a total bluff. Imagine him having to explain to your parents why you aren't there. Won't fly. But either way, doesn't seem like a huge loss :)", "NTA. This sounds like a win-win, no bridesmaid or wedding.", "NTA, but it's all in how you say it.    you did not have to say you did not want to be in the wedding in the first place, after all, you did accept.  It would have been to just say something along the lines of, \"I am glad you brought all of this up.  Now that I am pregnant I have so much I need to focus on that I can't devote the necessary time or energy to what I am sure is going to be  wonderful day for you.  I am glad the other bridesmaids are there for you.\"  so maybe apologize and rephrase it something like above starting out with, \"Hey I am sorry that came a little abrupt.  what I really meant to say is...\"", "NTA.  Take the win, and the get out of jail free card.  This was only ever going to end badly.", "NTA - you and SIL are like chalk and cheese. And it sounds like she's pretty superficial and emotionally demanding to boot (dumping someone from the wedding party because they are pregnant? really? and then getting hysterical because you don't \"care\" enough? It makes the head spin). If you actually let yourself get roped into her dog-and-pony show, she'll run you absolutely ragged for no thanks, at a time when you should be staying calm and preparing for your new family member.  \nI wouldn't rush to apologize and smooth down her ruffled hen feathers. From what you have described, she'll probably have more than one hissy fit before she makes it to the altar. The safest place to be is out of the line of fire.  \nBut I'd keep it very calm and very classy OP - just a brief card, perhaps, explaining that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings, then very minimal contact, and send a very nice present.  Don't give her more excuses to make you a target.", "TBH I think you really should of just said no from the start if you really don\u2019t like weddings at all to save yourself from all this drama(and everything up until the convo about the dress sounds pretty typical) but the bride was being unreasonable by removing you from being a bridesmaid yet still expected your help. You did blindside her though by agreeing to be bridesmaid initially only to rudely say \u201cI never wanted to anyway\u201d when you found an opportunity to do so. It was more hurtful than what was called for.\n\nESH", "ESH.\n\nKicking someone out of the bridal party because they are pregnant is bad enough, but still expecting them to put in all time, money, and effort of a bridesmaid? No thank you.\n\nOn the other side, this is your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Gleefully telling her you didn\u2019t want to be a part of her wedding means you are also gleefully implying you don\u2019t want to be there for your brother.\n\nI understand you two aren\u2019t close. However, you were thisclose to having the best of both worlds - getting out of everything without burning bridges.", "Sounds like she over-reacted, but YTA, a bit.  Seems unnecessary to have said.  Just say \"look, I'm pregnant, I'm going to need all of my planning brain for my baby.\"  \"I never wanted to...\" was beyond what was necessary.", "YTA for being rude, you didn't have to be that rude, you could have just said thank you for considering that, but that you would prefer to be completely out of the loop with the pregnancy and all. It would not have been a lie and it would have been fine. Instead you were a jerk. \n\nYou are not the asshole for not wanting to be in the wedding party, from what you describe it does kinda sound like a nightmare, but the way you said it really could do with an apology. Whether you go to the wedding or not is a different matter, and really has nothing to do with any of this.", "Gentle YTA. You should have just declined being a bridesmaid to begin with.  That said, let her know that you will not be able to attend the wedding. Send a card, small gift, and wish them well.", "NTA. She f'd around and found out. \n\nBut, many of us don't like weddings or being in weddings...until it's our own. That's why we do it. It's selfless and generous. To not do it is viewed as selfish. \n\nTo keep the peace, text her an apology and good luck on the wedding but you won't be able to make it. \n\nKeep in mind that they likely will not attend your wedding if you have one someday. \nAnd  people usually never forgive close friends and family who don't attend their weddings. You can never make it up to them. Ever.", "YTA.  Ouch.  It's okay to want to bow out (who wouldn't?!) but you really didn't need to tell her that you didn't want to be in the wedding in the first place.  You could have very graciously told her that with your pregnancy you're really just not up to all the planning, festivities, etc. and regretfully need to remove yourself from it all but will be thrilled to be a guest.", "YTA. You choose to be rude and insulting when you didn't need to be. Simple as that. You're an adult. No one made you say yes to being in the bridal party, and you already knew she was high maintenance, so her behavior wasn't really a surprise.", "YTA, come on, you know that's a hurtful thing to say even if it's true. No one wants to hear that you don't care about them. Yes the gender segregation makes it so you have to be in her party not your brother's, but that's sort of part of it and you were really doing it for him. You probably should not have said yes in the first place, but so it goes.\n\nGetting pregnant was the perfect way to get out of it, just say you couldn't handle all the duties and had to focus on your baby. Instead you decided to insult her and be an AH. Just be nice!\n\nShe does sound like a bit of a nightmare but you should still just apologise.
