If you actually let yourself get roped into her dog-and-pony show, she'll run you absolutely ragged for no thanks, at a time when you should be staying calm and preparing for your new family member.  \nI wouldn't rush to apologize and smooth down her ruffled hen feathers. From what you have described, she'll probably have more than one hissy fit before she makes it to the altar. The safest place to be is out of the line of fire.  \nBut I'd keep it very calm and very classy OP - just a brief card, perhaps, explaining that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings, then very minimal contact, and send a very nice present.  Don't give her more excuses to make you a target.", "TBH I think you really should of just said no from the start if you really don\u2019t like weddings at all to save yourself from all this drama(and everything up until the convo about the dress sounds pretty typical) but the bride was being unreasonable by removing you from being a bridesmaid yet still expected your help.

It would not have been a lie and it would have been fine. Instead you were a jerk. \n\nYou are not the asshole for not wanting to be in the wedding party, from what you describe it does kinda sound like a nightmare, but the way you said it really could do with an apology.

That said, let her know that you will not be able to attend the wedding. Send a card, small gift, and wish them well.", "NTA.

To not do it is viewed as selfish. \n\nTo keep the peace, text her an apology and good luck on the wedding but you won't be able to make it. \n\nKeep in mind that they likely will not attend your wedding if you have one someday. \nAnd  people usually never forgive close friends and family who don't attend their weddings. You can never make it up to them. Ever.", "YTA.  Ouch.  It's okay to want to bow out (who wouldn't?!) but you really didn't need to tell her that you didn't want to be in the wedding in the first place.  You could have very graciously told her that with your pregnancy you're really just not up to all the planning, festivities, etc. and regretfully need to remove yourself from it all but will be thrilled to be a guest.", "YTA. You choose to be rude and insulting when you didn't need to be. Simple as that. You're an adult. No one made you say yes to being in the bridal party, and you already knew she was high maintenance, so her behavior wasn't really a surprise.", "YTA, come on, you know that's a hurtful thing to say even if it's true. No one wants to hear that you don't care about them. Yes the gender segregation makes it so you have to be in her party not your brother's, but that's sort of part of it and you were really doing it for him. You probably should not have said yes in the first place, but so it goes.\n\nGetting pregnant was the perfect way to get out of it, just say you couldn't handle all the duties and had to focus on your baby. Instead you decided to insult her and be an AH. Just be nice!\n\nShe does sound like a bit of a nightmare but you should still just apologise.
