He can\u2019t afford food, or internet/ heating because most of his income goes on rent. So we invited him to stay at our house for a short while. We cooked for him, told him to help himself to snacks, and he of course could use our Wi-Fi. \n\nProblems started to arise when James would make himself food and leave his dishes on the bench, or make a coffee and leave coffee stains all over. \n\nI talked to him, he said it was his adhd and he\u2019d pay more attention. My bf also talked to him and said we\u2019re not his parents, so he needs to step up. \n\nLater, he broke my bf\u2019s favourite mug of 10 years that he bought when visiting the US (might sound silly but he really loved it) because he placed the mug onto thin air instead of the bench. He said sorry, but then got annoyed at my bf for still being sad hours later. \n\nThe next day he broke another mug for the same reason. So we went shopping and bought a cheap mug that was to be the only one he could use. When we gave it to him and told him why, he called us both dickheads and said he doesn\u2019t even feel guilty about smashing the first mug now because we\u2019re being ridiculous. \n\nMy bf doesn\u2019t do confrontation. So at that point, I told him that I didn\u2019t give a damn that he didn\u2019t like it and it\u2019s time he went home. I also said he\u2019s full of excuses and adhd isn\u2019t an excuse for being messy in someone else\u2019s home. \n\nSo now he\u2019s telling people I\u2019m TA since he has no money for food and I \u2018made fun of him for an accident\u2019.\n\nUpdate: A wonderful, kind stranger from New York offered to purchase and send a replacement mug to my partner! \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1677229117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11amwbe/aita_for_kicking_out_my_bfs_friend/", "score": 290, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't lose sleep over James and his whining.  NTA.  People who truly know you will understand.  Others can just go sod off.  Good luck!", "NTA. 100%\n\nGee\u2026 talk about being ungrateful\u2026. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility to take him in, you did it out of kindness and he has treated with complete disrespect in return. \n\nYou don\u2019t want that kind of person in your life, close the door and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA. adhd is not an excuse for being mean. plus its perfectly reasonable to buy someone who keeps breaking mugs a mug that wouldn't cause much...emotional or financial damage? (being a bit dramatic but u get the gist)...when/if it gets broken. it's not like you used his money either it was out of ur own pocket.", "NTA he is my age and I would be so embarrassed. He is an adult and needs to act like it. I wouldn't let him stay with me if he kept breaking stuff", "NTA. That so called friend is, and I think with that behaviour, you might as well cut him loose. What a lousy friend, using ADHD as an excuse is a big no-no, especially when you have friends who are willing to help you out.", "NTA. If he's so hard up, he can go stay with the people he's complaining about you to. I doubt people are lining up to help him out, though. He seems like an all-around inconsiderate jerk.", "NTA if anyone says something to you about it tell them they are welcome to let him move in their home.", "NTA, just another example of you give someone an inch they take a mile. And honestly I don\u2019t even know why the boyfriend is even friends with this guy anyway considering that he does not care about the boyfriend, if he purposely destroys a mug.", "NTA. You were totally on the right to confront him. \nYou gave him food, shelter and some care and he decides to give it back by insulting y'all ? Naah mate that shit ain't gonna work here. \n\nADHD or not... Doesn't give you a reason to behave that way to someone.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to help and he took advantage of the situation and then tried to make you into the bad guy, anyone who knows what he\u2019s like won\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually the bad guy. His situation is on him and nobody else. \n\nYou came up with a perfectly acceptable solution to the problem he was creating and he was a prick about it. Fuck that guy. You don\u2019t owe him shit.", "NTA\n\nWhy does this 'friend' think you're responsible for the fact that he doesn't have much money? You invited him into your home, he has proven himself to be an unpleasant guest so you have every right to kick him out.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make fun of him for an accident. You purchased him his very own mug after two identical accidents.", "NTA\n\nPeople like him are disrespectful. You gave him a chance,  and he f\\*cked it up.  He has some nerve calling you an AH when you opened your home to him.\n\nYou did the right thing telling him to go home.  People like him take advantage of kind people at every opportunity.\n\nGood riddance to James.", "NTA \n\nWell, both times he didn't pay attention because he didn't cared, so those are accidents caused by his negligence.\n\nFor people who break stuff (except SO & kids, they can break anything as long as they don't do it on purpose) i would have bought a plastic/metal mug (just an idea for future and i would preffer metal mug).\n\nBtw: those special mugs aren't for the use of guests, just for us, so for the rest we just use the regular ones.\n\nJames is rude and you aren't under some sort of obligation to host him, feed him.\n\nIf he doesn't respect your house, he can leech of others.", "NTA", "NTA. He showed no gratitude at your generosity but just the opposite. He basically shit on the two of you and seemed to think he was entitled to do so. 1 broken mug = accident. Finding out it was his favorite mug, ridiculing his sentimentality and breaking another one the next day was no accident.", "NTA. You didn't have to let him stay with you, yet y'all invited him into your home, helped him when he was down on his luck, and he repaid you by getting mad when you made accommodations for his breaking your belongings.", "NTA. You were kind enough to help him when he needed it. It wasn't your responsibility. He then abused your hospitality.\n\n>So now he\u2019s telling people I\u2019m TA since he has no money for food\n\nAgain, not your responsibility. Are the people he's complaining to going to take him in and let him take advantage of them?", "NTA\n\nWow he's so entitled, hopefully your bf will think about will he even remain friends with him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was probably inviting disaster number 3 by buying another porcelain one\ud83d\ude04. Thank you for your advice !", "Unfortunately I think his home is quite a mess right now. His grandma took his cat to her house because it was too gross for him to live in. I think he just doesn\u2019t care for whatever environment he\u2019s in. I understand depression and poor mental health can lead to that, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can treat our home the same way.", "Absolutely! I have it too and it\u2019s why I would gently remind him about things but after a while, it felt like he was using adhd as an excuse to be rude. The line was calling us names after we bought him his own mug.", "Plastic might catch a smell but that's it. Try find some thick (?) kind of plastic - to avoid melting with hot drinks.\n\nNo problem! Hope you'll be well!", "NTA", "I\u2019ll keep my eye out for one like that! Thank you again and take care \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA and I feel sorry about your boyfriend losing his favourite mug. I would also be sad if my favourite mug broke.", "NTA. I think we sometimes need to look at why someone's life is not going well before we throw ourselves into supporting them. His behaviour suggested he uses up people and opportunities. He then blames everyone else when people walk away so he doesn't need to take responsibility or change his behaviour.  \n\nHe will always struggle and have a sob story for why he is down on his luck. He's someone to keep at a distance.", "NTA", "NTA-let him mooch off someone else, they will understand why you told him to get out after a bit.", "NTA \nI have ADHD but I'm also hyperfocused on not making messes in someone else's home. I would also have been mortified and tried to look online for a replacement mug I broke or tried to fix it if I knew it was something sentimental in someone's house I broke. This guy is an entitled jerk", "I'm someone on the autism spectrum, and I hate it when anyone uses autism to be an ass. You can still be a decent person, no matter what.", "I have adhd and my whole family have trouble keeping mugs intact. I recently smashed my beloved work mug by putting it on thin air when I thought I was putting it on the table. I was being careful but sometimes my brain glitches out without warning. It's horribly embarrassing to not be in control of your own movements. \nMy family visited a ceramics exhibition at a gallery last weekend and it was quite stressful to be surrounded by all those expensive breakables!\n\nMaking someone use a plastic mug is a bit humiliating and infantilising.You can get some really nice enamel mugs on etsy with fun designs, which don't smell at all. I got one with family photos printed on the side for my granny to use in the garden. \nAlso my family make sure to buy stoneware rather than porcelain. It's much more robust. \n\nBut he has zero excuse for being a rude jerk and making the same mistake again, after you were so kind to him. Being an ungrateful butt is not an adhd symptom.", "NTA", "NTA, autism is not an excuse for being disrespectful and it's massively insulting to anyone with autism too.\n\nHe needs to be binned off and quickly. He's wore his welcome out and if any of your friends join in and say that you're being unreasonable then ask them when he's going to be moving in with them? If not then stfu", "NTA. He can tell ppl whatever he wants as long as he GTFO.", "My Opinion:\n\nNTA\n\nHe is not wrong, ADHD can impact things like doing the dishes/cleaning up (at least for me) and it\u2019s difficult to explain to people who don\u2019t have ADHD. But breaking a friends sentimental item and not feeling like shit about it. Is not ADHD. That\u2019s personality flaw imho. His ADHD is not really your issue, and the fact he\u2019s unsympathetic to breaking his friends favorite mug.", "NTA- I have ADHD and I've had the same mugs for over a decade. He's a jerk, cut him off.", ">He is an inconsiderate, ungrateful AH\n\nExactly, plus blaming his ADHD for being an ungrateful, inconsiderate AH is a dick move. \n\nThose who have ADHD have a hard enough time of it in life as it is, people like James who uses it as an excuse to behave in a shitty manner makes it 10x worse for those with ADHD who are trying to manage.", "NTA. You're housing and feeding this guy and his response is the break your shit and say he doesn't feel bad about it? The whole being mad at your bf for still being sad about his mug makes me think there's a reason he has no one else to help him and why he's in this situation, he doesn't sound like a good person.\n\nYou're doing him a huge favor, the absolute least he could do in return is clean up after himself and be careful not to break things.\n\nThe people he's criticizing you to are welcome to support him if they think you're such a meanie. \n\nWhat is he doing to fix his situation other than freeloading and breaking things? Has he been looking for higher paying jobs or more affordable housing? If not, then you're just enabling him by letting him stay anyway.", "op=NTA\n\nthis is a high level of ingratitude on his part.", "NTA When someone doesn't care what they do in your space and don't care if they break, or damage your things and are ungrateful for feeding them, then it is time to go. You certainly didn't make fun of them, quite the opposite. You asked them to take responsibility.", "NTA he\u2019s inconsiderate of the people doing him a favor", "NTA you tried to help him and he has abused your kindness."]}
