He can\u2019t afford food, or internet/ heating because most of his income goes on rent. So we invited him to stay at our house for a short while. We cooked for him, told him to help himself to snacks, and he of course could use our Wi-Fi. \n\nProblems started to arise when James would make himself food and leave his dishes on the bench, or make a coffee and leave coffee stains all over. \n\nI talked to him, he said it was his adhd and he\u2019d pay more attention. My bf also talked to him and said we\u2019re not his parents, so he needs to step up. \n\nLater, he broke my bf\u2019s favourite mug of 10 years that he bought when visiting the US (might sound silly but he really loved it) because he placed the mug onto thin air instead of the bench. He said sorry, but then got annoyed at my bf for still being sad hours later. \n\nThe next day he broke another mug for the same reason. So we went shopping and bought a cheap mug that was to be the only one he could use. When we gave it to him and told him why, he called us both dickheads and said he doesn\u2019t even feel guilty about smashing the first mug now because we\u2019re being ridiculous. \n\nMy bf doesn\u2019t do confrontation. So at that point, I told him that I didn\u2019t give a damn that he didn\u2019t like it and it\u2019s time he went home. I also said he\u2019s full of excuses and adhd isn\u2019t an excuse for being messy in someone else\u2019s home. \n\nSo now he\u2019s telling people I\u2019m TA since he has no money for food and I \u2018made fun of him for an accident\u2019.", "created_utc": 1677229117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11amwbe/aita_for_kicking_out_my_bfs_friend/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is an inconsiderate, ungrateful AH. Cut him out of your life and tell folks why he\u2019s no one to help.", "Wow.  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!  I wouldn't lose sleep over James and his whining.  NTA.  People who truly know you will understand.  Others can just go sod off.  Good luck!", "NTA. 100%\n\nGee\u2026 talk about being ungrateful\u2026. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility to take him in, you did it out of kindness and he has treated with complete disrespect in return. \n\nYou don\u2019t want that kind of person in your life, close the door and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA. adhd is not an excuse for being mean. plus its perfectly reasonable to buy someone who keeps breaking mugs a mug that wouldn't cause much...emotional or financial damage? (being a bit dramatic but u get the gist)...when/if it gets broken. it's not like you used his money either it was out of ur own pocket.", "NTA he is my age and I would be so embarrassed. He is an adult and needs to act like it. I wouldn't let him stay with me if he kept breaking stuff", "NTA. That so called friend is, and I think with that behaviour, you might as well cut him loose. What a lousy friend, using ADHD as an excuse is a big no-no, especially when you have friends who are willing to help you out.", "NTA. If he's so hard up, he can go stay with the people he's complaining about you to. I doubt people are lining up to help him out, though. He seems like an all-around inconsiderate jerk.", "NTA if anyone says something to you about it tell them they are welcome to let him move in their home.", "NTA, just another example of you give someone an inch they take a mile. And honestly I don\u2019t even know why the boyfriend is even friends with this guy anyway considering that he does not care about the boyfriend, if he purposely destroys a mug.", "NTA. You were totally on the right to confront him. \nYou gave him food, shelter and some care and he decides to give it back by insulting y'all ? Naah mate that shit ain't gonna work here. \n\nADHD or not... Doesn't give you a reason to behave that way to someone.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to help and he took advantage of the situation and then tried to make you into the bad guy, anyone who knows what he\u2019s like won\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually the bad guy. His situation is on him and nobody else. \n\nYou came up with a perfectly acceptable solution to the problem he was creating and he was a prick about it. Fuck that guy. You don\u2019t owe him shit.", "NTA\n\nWhy does this 'friend' think you're responsible for the fact that he doesn't have much money? You invited him into your home, he has proven himself to be an unpleasant guest so you have every right to kick him out.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make fun of him for an accident. You purchased him his very own mug after two identical accidents.", "NTA\n\nPeople like him are disrespectful. You gave him a chance,  and he f\\*cked it up.  He has some nerve calling you an AH when you opened your home to him.\n\nYou did the right thing telling him to go home.  People like him take advantage of kind people at every opportunity.\n\nGood riddance to James.", "NTA \n\nWell, both times he didn't pay attention because he didn't cared, so those are accidents caused by his negligence.\n\nFor people who break stuff (except SO & kids, they can break anything as long as they don't do it on purpose) i would have bought a plastic/metal mug (just an idea for future and i would preffer metal mug).\n\nBtw: those special mugs aren't for the use of guests, just for us, so for the rest we just use the regular ones.\n\nJames is rude and you aren't under some sort of obligation to host him, feed him.\n\nIf he doesn't respect your house, he can leech of others.", "NTA", "NTA. He showed no gratitude at your generosity but just the opposite. He basically shit on the two of you and seemed to think he was entitled to do so. 1 broken mug = accident. Finding out it was his favorite mug, ridiculing his sentimentality and breaking another one the next day was no accident.", "NTA. You didn't have to let him stay with you, yet y'all invited him into your home, helped him when he was down on his luck, and he repaid you by getting mad when you made accommodations for his breaking your belongings.", "NTA. You were kind enough to help him when he needed it. It wasn't your responsibility. He then abused your hospitality.\n\n>So now he\u2019s telling people I\u2019m TA since he has no money for food\n\nAgain, not your responsibility. Are the people he's complaining to going to take him in and let him take advantage of them?", "NTA\n\nWow he's so entitled, hopefully your bf will think about will he even remain friends with him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
