It's dramatically cut down on frizz and breakage, and you will pry it from my cold, dead hands. \nFrankly, I'm surprised more people don't wear them, they're awesome. \nSide note: Edwardian and Victorian woman and some men wore \"nightcaps\" to bed, so their hair wouldn't tangle and also to stay warm because central heating wasn't a thing. This isn't a culture based phenomenon.\nIf your wife is truly concerned about cultural appropriation, ask her to look up some European based nightcaps (or 1920's boudoir caps)and get you one, they were often fancy af and kinda ridiculous but if I were in your place I'd just lean into it, go full frilly lace and ribbons \ud83c\udf80", "White people wore silk bonnets to protect their hair as well.
