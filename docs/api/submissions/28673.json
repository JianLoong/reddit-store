You dumped one caregiving responsibility on your wife and tried to dump the other on your daughter. Hannah was not arrested for abandoning the kids, but maybe you should've been.

Michael is a senior and could lose his football scholarship if he misses even a practice, and there is no world where I could ever ask Shauna to even watch herself. So I only really have Hannah (17f). \n\nIt's been a month so far, and Hannah is understandably getting tired of this. I've tried explaining that this is temporary, and that I'm sorry but she's my only option and why. Last Friday, I was supposed to be home but had to go into work late, which I told Hannah. \n\nI guess she snuck out anyway because I got a call **four** hours later that a neighbor had reported that two small kids were home alone. I rushed home to deal with everything and reported Hannah missing. The police found her three hours after that. I was given the option of picking her up from the station, but I was so angry that I let her sit there until the cops decided to take her home. \n\nWhen she came back, she was embarrassed that her friends \"saw her get arrested\" and she was almost charged with being a runaway. I don't think I did anything wrong and she might as well learn a lesson in responsibility, but my mom and sister think I was too harsh and should have picked her up.

That\u2019s why I said ESH.", "she has a 17 year old sister and an 18 year old brother. Where were they?\n\nthat's why im saying YTA and not e s h- he has other options, he's just choosing to only inconvenience Hannah and rob her of a social life. She's his daughter, not is au pair. Even au pairs get days off.", "He doesn\u2019t trust one of them, and the other has a major commitment.  But yes, he should\u2019ve hired a sitter.  But it still *does not* justify her leaving two children *unattended.*", "a major commitment everyday before school, after school and through the entire weekend? I doubt it. He's the golden child, plain and simple.\n\nI assume Hannah is in school, and that its a critical juncture for her, too; even if she isn't an athlete. He's only a year older.\n\nSorry but OP should have gone his ass home on a Friday night - wife is away, kid is overloaded and there's a 4 and 6 year old waiting at home. He's an asshole for not picking her up at the station and talking to her- rather then making her wait and be driven home when the cops felt like it. What a shitty father.", "We don\u2019t know what everyone\u2019s schedule is.  We don\u2019t know that the son is the \u201cgolden child\u201d just because he has commitments.  Unless OP is going to provide a calendar showing who\u2019s doing what and when, we don\u2019t have all the information.  \n\nMy point remains: she shouldn\u2019t have left a 4 y/o and a 6 y/o unattended.  If she couldn\u2019t handle it, she could\u2019ve called him, her mother, a neighbor, etc.", "He's a *football star*! He can't risk getting kicked off the team!", "he asked for judgment on whether he was wrong not picking her up from the police station. I think everyone agrees she shouldn't have left a 4 and 6 year old alone.\n\nAlso I just wanted to point out he reported her as a runaway- so she's likely made her displeasure with the situation clear and he didn't care to be a decent parent and make other arrangements. Or to be a decent parent and pick up his kid from the police station after she made a bad choice after a month of being a responsible stay at home ~~slave~~  babysitter", "But you\u2019re right, the brother probably has more free time."]}
