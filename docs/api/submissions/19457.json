Is your sister planning on wearing a white ball gown to your wedding, though, or just wants to see what she\u2019ll look like in one for her own wedding someday?", "NTA but I would already make it clear that she can't wear white (if you don't want that).", "NTA take whoever you want with you. Buying your dress is a big thing and sister is going to make it all about her, then ditch her.", "NTA. This is your special time, and you should invite the people who you feel will best support you during the dress selection process.", "NTA. that's your special day and you have right to your feelings, it's your wedding and you don't have to include anyone you don't want to. you are not selfish in this situation and if your sister can't support you in a positive way, then why she should go to your wedding?", "NTA!!!!! \n\nSo, let me see if I have this straight: It's YOUR wedding, but she's taken it upon HERSELF to become a bridesmaid, to make suggestions/decisions on the arrangements of your special day, and THEN when you're going to go dress shopping, SHE is gonna try on bridal gowns too...Even though she's not getting married???? \n\nOooooh, those be some fightin' behaviors, if you ask me! LOL!! Way overstepping boundaries, on her part. I don't blame you for not wanting to invite her, to avoid the drama and stuff. It's not selfish to want YOUR DAY to be about YOU and your husband, and not your sister. It's perfectly understandable how you're feeling. \n\nI would make sure to set some really clear boundaries with her and communicate (because it sounds like you've just been letting things slide instead of confronting her behaviors) with her; especially about her NOT WEARING A WEDDING DRESS to your wedding (or any white dress, for that matter lol). Good grief! Good luck, lady!", "NTA is she seeing someone? Or have a crush on your fianc\u00e9? And hoping to hijack your big day?", "How does one \u2018make herself a bridesmaid?\u2019  Shouldn\u2019t you be formally asked?", "NTA. Say, \"I love how supoortive you are and I appreciate all you're doing to help. But I want this to be just me and mom.\" \n\nAnd make sure she knows not to wear white!", "NTA, I 100% wouldn't take her. It is your enjoyment, not hers. That comment about what kind of wedding dress you are going to wear?! OMG. Out of line.\n\nActually ridiculous as she is telling you to wear champagne and planning to go for white herself?!!! This is downright screaming I want my sister's wedding to be mine.\nI would actually stop involving her...and made it clear this is your wedding. She should focus on finding a partner to have her own wedding. And definitely forbid her wearing white", "NTA don\u2019t tell her when dress shopping is and don\u2019t invite her. If you don\u2019t want it to be problematic, do something like only allow your maid of honor, mother and FMIL", "NTA, however expect this to damage your relationship with your sister if you do it suddenly without warning her first. Now this advice is all assuming you want a good relationship with her, if it's already trashed ignore the rest of this. However if you otherwise get along your much better off having a serious conversation with her first. She's \"allowed\" to think your being crazy as long as she listens (she's still an AH for it though). If she agrees to back off bring her along, but put one of your friends in charge of keeping her under control. Good luck!!!!", "NTA. It is normal to IMAGINE what you would look like in different dresses while out shopping for bridal gown for someone else. It is definitely AH territory to try anything on at someone else\u2019s appointment.", "NTA\n\nIt's not that she wants to have drinks during the trip but she wants to also try on dresses. She is cosplaying being the bride. That needs to stop right now. I would think if you go over your entire relationship with her you'll see how most everything is really about her. \n\nI recommend limiting her access and input to the wedding planning. If she keeps pressing things then demote her to regular guest.", "Just curious. Why is it important that you are first to marry?

(I mean that in a non bridezilla way)\n\nIf your sister makes a fuss tell her you wanted the day for only yourself and mum, and you are keeping your dress a secret from everyone.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to upstage you. It\u2019s your wedding and dress, not hers.", "How dare the younger sister get married before the older sister! (Sarcasm) NTA.", "She says she just wants to try one on to see how she looks, but a) that's not really allowed in bridal stores here and could get us kicked out (only the person the appointment is booked for can try on the dresses) and b) a mutual friend told me she's looking at very bridal (albeit not actually white-white) dresses  to wear to my wedding anyway so I'm not sure? Pretty sure she just wants to try them on though", "Mostly I just nod and say \"we'll take that into consideration\" and then just ignore whatever she said. I've set a boundary with her please not wearing a white dress to my wedding. She says \"dress shopping is meant to be fun for everyone and I'm part of everyone\", so I don't think she means any harm, just wants to see what it's like and join in on the fun since she doesn't want to get married herself", "She has a boyfriend and they're super sweet together. And no, she definitely does not have a crush on my fianc\u00e9, but that does make for a funny image, so thank you for that", "Ironically she doesn't plan on ever getting married herself since she doesn't like the whole concept of it. \nI don't think she's wearing white, from what I know she's looking for a peachy pink colour now", "I really don't want to ruin my relationship with her. We're not always on the best terms, but at the end of the day she's my big sister and I love her. That's why I feel so bad for even debating this.", "Where I'm from the first and last wedding in a family are extra important for the parents and comes with a few extra customs. My mum has been extra excited since she gets to play a very important role in this and it's been a nice bonding experience that I don't really want to share.", "Surely if she's going to be a bridesmaid, you should dictate exactly what color she has to wear. I'd make that very clear right now. \n\nNTA for not wanting her at the dress shopping. This should be about you.", "Hmm if she told a friend of yours she\u2019s looking at bridal-like dresses to wear at your wedding, I would believe that person and have a frank discussion about that with your sister. It\u2019s unfair to you if she does show up in something to your wedding that makes you uncomfortable.", "I don't know. Not my business or say, but it sounds like she's overstepping on your personal time/event and it just kinda gives me \"off vibes\". Ultimately, it's up to you, though, and you know her better than we do! So, take the heartfelt comments and advice with a grain of salt. And congrats on your marriage! I hope your wedding is amazing! <3", "If she wants to have the experience, she can book her own appointment and \" be the bride\" for a day. She doesn't get to hijack your appointment. If not having her would be a thing, make sure the bridal shop is aware ahead of time so they can head her off, and enforce the rules from the get go, that only the bride gets to try on dresses. Also, bridesmaids wear the color the bride picks if they want to be in the wedding party.", "you can also love her from afar", "So, your sister\u2019s wedding will be lesser? Perhaps she senses your attitude. But yay, you win I guess.", "Thank you! To be honest the most exciting part is that at the end of the wedding I'll be able to say \"that's my husband\", so I'm sure no matter what I'll be happy :)", "It wouldn't be! If/when she has her own wedding, I'm sure everyone will be just as excited (probably even more) and I haven't brought it up to her at all, but you're right I shouldn't have mentioned it here either", "Sounds like you found a good one! I'm happy for you and I'm glad to see you're so excited! Have the best time! Take care. :)", "NTA and most bridal shops won\u2019t let her try on anything but bridesmaid stuff. Salespeople don\u2019t want you to ruin their samples so they bring the dress to you and help you into them, they don\u2019t just like you go hog wild like a basic department store.", "NTA... take those you want there", "No. Infact I strongly urge you not to say when,where or how. She's too involved already and you need to put her in her place especially about a white ball gown. It's your day not hers and tell her that, hurt feelings be damned.   Don't back down.", "NTA but based on your comments it may be time to give your sister a reality check and kick her from the wedding party. It sounds like shes trying to plan *her* wedding, not yours.", "I'd keep her as a bridesmaid just so you can pick her outfit. Otherwise she's 100% showing up in a white dress.", "Having her as a bridesmaid is a good opportunity to ensure that she doesn't show up in that white ball gown. No matter how much she ticks you off, keep her in the party to ensure she wears a dress that doesn't make you scream inside.\n\nIf you need to pacify her, have her do a reading (that you chose/approve) to give her that moment in the spotlight she seems to crave.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Invite your mom to go dress shopping and don't tell your sister about it. Explain to your mother that you want this special day to be just for the two of you and not to tell your sister. When your sister finds out that you already have a gown tell her that she had already been generous enough with her time and you wanted to give your mom some time, too.", "NTA, although the way you phrase things sounds like you don't think much of your sister in general. Don't know your life, maybe it's warranted.", "You need to put your foot down and inform her she is making you uncomfortable. I know sometimes we want to just keep the peace, but this isn\u2019t about her feelings and yours are just as valid and should be honored, especially in your wedding planning. She seems jealous and I would mention how her behavior makes u feel. Establish your bridesmaids colors and keep it that.", "OP, she clearly likes the concept if she\u2019s forcing her opinions into your planning. Actions speak louder than words."]}
