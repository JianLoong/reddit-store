He already knows how you feel about his gf and won't want you hanging out with them. I know it's tough, but sometimes we have to bite our tongues to hold back opinions. The most you can do is apologize to him, let him know you're happy he's happy, and leave it at that. If and when things go south between the two of them, you can be there to help him pick up the pieces. That's what friends do.", "She's 32 years old and won't eat unless he cuts her food for her?

I\u2019d call this just desserts. \n\nHis girlfriend can have some too, just make sure your buddy spoon-feeds her.", "NTA but it sounds like she's manipulative/abusive so you may want to try to patch things up and be a friend to him in this situation", "INFO: Why are you lashing out at this woman who so far hasn't done anything wrong? You say the list goes on with her issues, but I'd need to hear this list to pass a judgement. You've meant this woman at most 5 times (assuming she went with him everytime). The food thing is weird, but at most a quirk. Everything else seems on your friend. Two people are in a relationship, and it seems him getting wrapped up with his partner is a reoccuring pattern and has virtually nothing to do with her.\n\nDoes she restrict his meetings with you, or does he just want to spend time with the person he loves? It's also his choice whether to charge her, and its unfairness is entirely up to him to decide as it's his mortgage that he would be paying anyway. Your friend shouldn't have lashed out at you like that, but you seem to have a hangup on his girlfriend for your friend not having interest in hanging out with you, and you went nuclear and attacked HER instead of your friend. Without more info, my judgement hangs on ESH except for the girlfriend.", "ESH - your friend was rude and also he's a crap friend if he doesn't bother with you unless he's single. But you were needlessly offensive about his partner - I'm not sure how their finances are any of your business and the only negative thing I can see is he cuts up her food for her, which is a bit odd. But to say she's immature for saying he shouldn't drink too much etc - that shows immaturity on your level. Also the fact you attacked him by criticising his partner, not him, says a lot - he's the one who doesn't prioritise your friendship, so why is your issue with her?", "YTA - even if he makes crappy decisions, they are HIS decisions. It's not up to you to control his life, but to decide how much you want to hang out knowing how he will behave.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

By your own admission you have a bad temper and went on a rant which only serves to push him away from you, and then you put a \"fuck off\" cherry on top.  Do you know anyone that enjoys being subject to your bad temper?  Do you think after that he is going to want to listen to anything you have to say?  You pushed him deeper into her arms as now she is the one that will give him the understanding ear and spin the narrative that his friends just don't understand him anymore.\n\nIf his relationship makes you sad, then it would have been better to him separately and tell him that in a calm concerned voice instead of trying to shout over him that no matter how much he thinks your choices suck, that you think his choices suck worse.", "ESH. Why are y'all even friends when you have such disdain for him?", "Definitely YTAH", "Lol your friend sounds like my brother. A serial monogamist who can't stay single for longer than a couple weeks, and will latch on to anyone who shows him attention. I had to watch him go through relationship after relationship, each girl seemed to get worse than the last one. And man, that food cutting thing gives me flashbacks to the time that my brother's gf at the time (imo the worst one he had) said \"umm, my shoe's untied\" and my brother GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES and tied her shoe. \n\nHonestly are you the asshole? Yeah probably. But he needed to hear it. He won't listen tho. Maybe there will be a thing that happens that breaks the spell with this girl. But he will just move on to the next one.", "NTA. But it's time to take a step back from this friendship. Hang out in groups and keep things surface level.

Sounds exhausting. Spend time with other solo people or friends groups who do show up!", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH. I think you told him what he needed to hear, but issues with peoples partners needs to be done delicately if they\u2019re ever gonna hear it.

I had a friend who always said she was lucky not to be like me because I was single. Meanwhile, she was dating (and later married) someone she barely even liked. I let her comments go for a while but eventually I realized that she didn't particularly like me and I didn't care to be her punching bag anymore. \n\nIt sounds like your friend is a serial monogamist who doesn't have great taste in partners.

Like how do you survive 32 years with that kind of mentality.", "I've had a though that may be an unpopular opinion...He's cutting up her food, he's the one infantilizing her and, it's from his own mouth that she is the instigator...this has alot of signs of an abusive relationship. But, maybe not of the most obvious dynamic.", "I wouldn't try to patch things up\n\nThis so called friend has a history and pattern of ditching his homies for relationships and only tries to be friends when nothing else in life is going on. That by definition is not a friend. Kick that guy to the curb.

Seems like they deserve each other so I guess the only thing for you to do is live your life how you see fit and let him carry on with his. He'll see the light one day.", "He's made his own decisions though. I know it's disappointing when people seek a relationship with anyone just to be happy, but this is what they prioritize. As a friend, all you can do is support what makes him happiest.", ">any time she isn\u2019t around he bitches about her behavior\n\nINFO: what's your response when he does this?", "Sounds like they deserve each other. Stop involving yourself with this situation and find new friends. \n\nYour temper is your responsibility though. A professional can help you learn to manage it.

Consider this a friendship lost.", "Some people are so desperately afraid of being alone with themselves and their own thoughts that they'd prefer a miserable relationship to it. There's not you can do for that sort, because only they can take the time to self-analyze and seek out either help or try and change their behaviour.", "Maybe do some reading about controlling/ abusive relationships.  It's possible he's with an emotionally abusive partner.\n\nIf that's the case, text him once that you care about him, you genuinely want the best for him, and you hope he has a romantic partner who makes him happy.  If he ever needs your help leaving a relationship that is no longer right for him, he can reach out to you - even if you haven't spoken in a long time.\n\nThat message is important because one of the first things controlling partners do is cut their victims off from their friends and family.  Sometimes it's overt, but other times it's by driving a wedge between them - getting them to leave events early or ignore their friends at dinner in favor of the toxic partner, so the friends get mad and quit reaching out to the victim.\n\nIt's possible your friend is just a jerk.  But do some reading to see if maybe he has a tendency to get involved with controlling and even abusive partners, and if so let him know you'll be there for him when he needs it. \n\nThen move on with your own life and hope that someday he'll be ready to break the cycle of crappy relationships.", "You can tell him and be honest about it.  But you shouldn't have lashed out at him.  That will only make him way less receptive to your advice.", "Because there's always some dumbo like OPs friend who will indulge them.", "Your relationship with him and his drinking is entirely different from a potential mate (kids could be involved) and their relationship with his drinking. Also, please keep in mind, inebriation on all three of your parts does not make for a great discussion.", "Your friend is an adult and can make his own drink decisions. You don't need to get involved. His partner is already involved, you getting in their business about that isn't gonna help.", "If you\u2019ve only seen him 5 times in 2 years then you might not be the best person to judge whether or not he should be drinking more. My friend\u2019s husband loves to drink, his friends enjoy drinking with him, and he especially has a good time drinking whenever his one friend comes into town. The issues is that he doesn\u2019t stop drinking, will disappear or spend tons of money or go home and keep drinking and pick fights/be terrible to his wife. She told him if he doesn\u2019t get sober then she\u2019ll get a divorce. His friend who lives out of town and only visits every so often would probably have the same reaction as you. You don\u2019t know how alcohol effects their relationship.", "There's absolutely nothing wrong with telling a friend how they have changed and how it has affected you. And, he certainly shouldn't be attacking you for your life choices. But, this doesn't make it ok to attack him either.", "If drinking is a go to form of entertainment in your 30s, your whole group has a maturity problem.

What are you doing about it?\" Or even \"I'm tired of hearing you complain about Belinda, let's talk about something else\" but you choose not to.\n\nBasically your friendship is him venting and leaving parties early. If that's what you want, keep doing what you're doing - otherwise *use your words*.", "I empathize. Your friend was being incredibly disrespectful and accusatory when you were making a valid point.
