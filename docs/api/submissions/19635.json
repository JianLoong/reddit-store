He can only be single for 2 months max before he needs to be in another and during that time he try\u2019s to sleep with anyone he matches with.  He disappears in his relationships and only wants to hang out if his partners leave town, we see him maybe once every 3 months. His new girlfriend is the by far the worst he\u2019s ever had. \n\nHe left a friends birthday dinner 1 hour in, after ordering all of his food and paying before anyone else was able to even get their food because she wanted to go home. He\u2019s done this 3 times. He cuts her food for her and she won\u2019t eat unless he does.he\u2019s not allowed to have more than 2 drinks etc.  The list goes on about how immature she is especially since she\u2019s 32.

I think we've all known someone like this. Sometimes these people need a hard truth or two.", "NTA, but I think you've closed the door for any hope of spending time with him in the future. He already knows how you feel about his gf and won't want you hanging out with them. I know it's tough, but sometimes we have to bite our tongues to hold back opinions. The most you can do is apologize to him, let him know you're happy he's happy, and leave it at that. If and when things go south between the two of them, you can be there to help him pick up the pieces. That's what friends do.", "She's 32 years old and won't eat unless he cuts her food for her? Did I read that correctly?\n\nLMAO. NTA. Never apologize for having standards.", "NTA. I\u2019d call this just desserts. \n\nHis girlfriend can have some too, just make sure your buddy spoon-feeds her.", "NTA but it sounds like she's manipulative/abusive so you may want to try to patch things up and be a friend to him in this situation", "INFO: Why are you lashing out at this woman who so far hasn't done anything wrong? You say the list goes on with her issues, but I'd need to hear this list to pass a judgement. You've meant this woman at most 5 times (assuming she went with him everytime). The food thing is weird, but at most a quirk. Everything else seems on your friend. Two people are in a relationship, and it seems him getting wrapped up with his partner is a reoccuring pattern and has virtually nothing to do with her.\n\nDoes she restrict his meetings with you, or does he just want to spend time with the person he loves? It's also his choice whether to charge her, and its unfairness is entirely up to him to decide as it's his mortgage that he would be paying anyway. Your friend shouldn't have lashed out at you like that, but you seem to have a hangup on his girlfriend for your friend not having interest in hanging out with you, and you went nuclear and attacked HER instead of your friend. Without more info, my judgement hangs on ESH except for the girlfriend.", "ESH - your friend was rude and also he's a crap friend if he doesn't bother with you unless he's single. But you were needlessly offensive about his partner - I'm not sure how their finances are any of your business and the only negative thing I can see is he cuts up her food for her, which is a bit odd. But to say she's immature for saying he shouldn't drink too much etc - that shows immaturity on your level. Also the fact you attacked him by criticising his partner, not him, says a lot - he's the one who doesn't prioritise your friendship, so why is your issue with her?", "YTA - even if he makes crappy decisions, they are HIS decisions. It's not up to you to control his life, but to decide how much you want to hang out knowing how he will behave.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also said he\u2019s turned into a crap friend by constantly trying to appease her. The drinking thing isn\u2019t a big deal if it wasn\u2019t on nights where we all agree to go grab drinks and then he says he\u2019d like another but X doesn\u2019t want him drinking anymore\u2026he loves to drink and has never been a problem.", "id say manipulation is a form of abuse in a relationship, you shouldn't be doing that to your loved ones. but yikes!!! have you discussed this with other close friends or even family of his?", "We talk about it constantly but since he\u2019s never around we have never been able to talk to him about it. When you only see a guy twice a year, you don\u2019t want to ruin it with a discussion about how his girlfriend is manipulating him and he really needs to learn how to be alone for a bit."]}
