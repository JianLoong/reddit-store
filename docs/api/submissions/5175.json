I need surgery from it but due to the healthcare system I\u2019ve been waiting for years and it\u2019s been getting worse. One of my best friend was suppose to be married in 2020 but due to the pandemic she had to push it to Oct 2022. So at that point I was still able to walk and she wanted to have it at a national park. The walk is about 2 km uphill to a waterfall and lake the walk has roots so I can\u2019t ride a wheelchair there. \n\nSo it\u2019s been over 2 years and I tell her a few months ago I probably can\u2019t make the walk. We brainstormed some other solutions but in the end it doesn\u2019t look like there isn\u2019t an easy way for me to attend. There was a guy friend coming that could help carry me but he moved countries and decided not to. She apologized but said it was her dream to get married at that waterfall and I said I understood but was definitely not happy about it since we had been friends for years and I expected to attend. \n\nI did say to a mutual friend I wasn\u2019t happy with her choice of wedding venue and I wish she valued me enough to change it so I can go. I know when she made the plans I confirmed I could go but I think she should be able to change plans since time has passed. That friend I was offloading to offloaded to the bridesmaids and people took sides. Some contacted the bride and told her to change the venue because they felt like I should be allowed to attend and others said it was planned for and I shouldn\u2019t expect it to change for me. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize how bad it got until the bride came back and accused me of trying to ruin her wedding. I said I just told a friend what I thought and I didn\u2019t go any further and she called me selfish and told me it was her wedding and the pandemic wasn\u2019t her fault so she couldn\u2019t control that in that time I\u2019d gotten worse. I told her she can\u2019t but if she had any compassion for me she\u2019s change it to somewhere I can go to and she hung up on me.\n\nShe then cancelled the wedding completely but I heard she basically eloped and got married to her fianc\u00e9 with only half the bridesmaids and her parents present. The ones who defended me and argued with her said she cut them out of the wedding and have stopped talking to them. I feel really had now because I didn\u2019t actually want to go to the wedding badly enough to lose her as a friend but I didn\u2019t think she would cut us all off as a result. I don\u2019t know if I should contact her or what to say or if Im even in the wrong in this.", "created_utc": 1671495480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq8fzh/aita_for_causing_my_friend_to_elope/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You managed to make a good, long-term friend\u2019s wedding plans all about you. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to think that after she had to postpone her wedding for 2 YEARS she should also have to give up her DREAM venue to accommodate someone who should\u2019ve been supportive and excited for her. \n\nYou could\u2019ve been FaceTimed in if you wanted to watch her vows that badly or just waited for the pictures to come out like everyone else who isn\u2019t able to attend a wedding. Her friend that moved out of country didn\u2019t ask her to change plans when he couldn\u2019t go and you shouldn\u2019t have either. People miss weddings they really want to go to for financial, health, and logistical reasons all the time. \n\nInstead of gossiping you should\u2019ve been sending a congratulatory card with some cash. You and everyone else who didn\u2019t pick the brides side are all the AH", "YTA. You didn\u2019t want to go badly enough to lose her as a friend, but just enough for her to change her dream venue for you. It was HER wedding.", "YTA: So because you couldn't go to the wedding you had a petty party instead, causing drama where none was needed, and making what is usually a stressful time for any bride that much more painful. So much so that they felt the need to cancel their wedding and elope.\n\nTHE WEDDING WAS NEVER ABOUT YOU! WAY TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT YOU OP.", "YTA - your accident is tragic but it was an AH move to guilt your friends and spread gossip! Their wedding isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about them! You may have lost a friend over an event.", "Yikes. YTA ~ but honestly\u2026\u2026 how did you type all that out and not see it? The bride tried very hard to accommodate your injury but the panini tanked that. So instead of sending a lovely wedding gift with an invitation to have coffee and catch up after the honeymoon; you decided to try and coerce her to change venues? And when that didn\u2019t work, you tried to get everyone on your side so she\u2019d get the guilt from as many sides as possible? \n\nI mean\u2026.. I don\u2019t blame the bride for dropping you and the other bridesmaids over this attack. I\u2019m just surprised that you typed this out and still didn\u2019t understand how much you\u2019re TA.", "YTA. The wedding isn't for you, was never for you, was never about you. What you actually did was upset this poor woman so much that she didn't have her dream wedding because you acted selfish and cruel towards her over things she could not control", "YTA. \n\n>So it\u2019s been over 2 years and I tell her a few months ago I probably can\u2019t make the walk.\n\nYour dear friend has waited for years to have her wedding, and when she made plans, you could attend. Then, a few months before the wedding, you tell her you ***probably*** can't. Then, you started trouble by telling a friend that you wished she valued you enough to change her wedding plans so you could attend. Why don't you value her enough to bow out gracefully or find someone else who can carry you? \n\nMy dear friend called to tell me she was pregnant and had terrible morning sickness a day or two before my wedding. Of course, there was nothing we could do at that point. Her parents and husband took lots of pictures to show her, and we watched the video together after the wedding. Yes, friends want each other at their important milestones, but they also make accommodations for those friends. \n\nYou closed your post by saying you didn't want to go to the wedding badly enough to lose her as a friend, but you didn't realize she would cut you off. She is angry because you gossiped about her and tried to make out that she is in the wrong at a time when she is already stressed. Sometimes throwing yourself at another person's feet (figuratively) with a genuine apology works wonders.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t the one getting married. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were in the bridal party. You weren\u2019t paying for the wedding. It wasn\u2019t your place to demand a change of venue. \n\nYou took something that was supposed to be the best day of HER life and made it about YOU.

It has nothing to do with you, so you don't get to ask her (or guilt trip her) to make changes because of an unfortunate situation you've had to endure.  \n\nI understand venting to a friend and them sharing your views with the bride was not your fault.  However, when she called you, trying to tell her she needed to have compassion for you is what pushed it over the line, I believe.", "Wow. \n\nYTA. Imagine being so self absorbed and inconsiderate that you think HER whole wedding should revolve around YOU. Ick. \n\nYou're the AH and a really shoddy friend. You'd be lucky if she gave you the time of day to apologize.", "YTA.\n\n>> I wish she valued me enough to change it \n\nWhy do you feel entitled to make *her* wedding about *you*? It was *her* dream to get married at a specific location and she should have been free to do so regardless of if you could attend. \n\nMaybe *you* should have valued *her* enough to be disappointed that you couldn\u2019t attend but still supportive of her fulfilling her dreams. She was right in saying that you\u2019re selfish and I\u2019m glad she cut contact with you.

And I understand being disappointed, but this part is what made it clear you were being an asshole and inconsiderate of your friend's wishes. I think it's completely unreasonable for you to expect her to revolve her entire wedding around you, after you confirmed you would be able to go and then waited so long to tell her that you would not be able to. It's not easy to change an entire wedding, especially this far into it.", "YTA\n\nHmm this is a toughie at first I was like NTA then when I heard you saying that to other people AH then when I reread it only venting to one person NTA and then when you said \u201cIf you have any compassion for me you would change it\u201d set you solidly in the AH category. All of this could have been avoided, you already said someone could have carried you, why not have just payed a local to carry you I\u2019m sure you could have found someone who would do it for a hundred or two.", "YTA for not supporting your friend on their choice. Your situation is certainly worthy of sympathy, but you tried to use it as a weapon against your \"friend\". Her wedding, her dream, is not about you.\n\nYour friend's reaction is a little extreme, so not sure you lost much. Maybe ESH.", "YTA - It\u2019s not your wedding. I understand your circumstances have changed and I\u2019m sorry for your situation, but you saying she has no compassion for you because she doesn\u2019t want to change her wedding location is such an overstep. Stop playing the victim card. You have no right to dictate where or when someone gets married, if you can\u2019t attend for whatever reason then unfortunately that\u2019s something you need to accept. I\u2019m disabled but I don\u2019t expect the world to bend to me, there are some things I\u2019ll never be able to do but not much I can do about it. The fact you say \u201cI wish she valued me enough to change it so I could go\u201d tells me you care more about having a day out than a friend celebrating her wedding how she wants to. You don\u2019t seems happy for her, you seem worried about yourself and nothing more.", "YTA. You\u2019re a selfish asshole. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. At all. And no, your friend didn\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d you this in any capacity.", "It's OP's utterly clueless audacity for me here. She literally thinks because a friend can't attend for medical reasons a bride within basically weeks of her already been postponed for two years wedding should change everything to accommodate her friend. And when the bride didn't do this she went all petty AF and started a gossipy war among the bridal party. Which may not have been her intention, but still was the end result of whining on another friends shoulder. And actually destroyed the brides dream wedding. And she has the unmistakable total entitlement to wonder if she did anything wrong? In case you were wondering OP , most definitely YTA. The bride had to cancel her wedding and elope because of your behavior, you lost a friend because of your own personal feelings of entitlement.", "I feel like YTA, you could have watched the wedding video and been in the rest of her life. Now, you don\u2019t get to do either. In general, weddings are not about the guests. \n\nOn a side note, I hope you feel better soon.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry that your injury is preventing you from attending your friends wedding but it\u2019s her wedding and she shouldn\u2019t be expected to change the venue for one friend. I don\u2019t know why you would think that\u2019s an acceptable request. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about her and her fianc\u00e9.", "YTA\n\nI understand the need to unload and vent, the friend should have known to keep her mouth shut, and if she wanted to help just say something in a sensitive way like \"OP is upset she can't come, is there anything we can all figure out?\" instead of relaying what someone said while venting.\n\nYou're an AH because of your response. It's her wedding. She can do what she wants with it. Instead it turned into an entire drama about you. That's a lot to take on. She probably received a lot of hate over this. It sounds like you don't really care that much about what she was likely dealing with. Changing locations isn't always practical or feasible. It costs a lot of money too. Besides, it was her dream location.\n\nThe gracious thing to do would have been to grin and bear it. It sucks. It's disappointing for you. But you can't expect everyone to move heaven and earth for you and change something that was well and truly locked in. But also, did you even try to stop people from shitting all over her? Or come to her defence? I'd be horrified if my words caused this even if I was upset.\n\nI hope you're able to have your surgery soon, OP, and hopefully you haven't lost a friendship or two over this.", "Sorry OP, YTA. Your accident is tragic and you don't deserve to be going through all these difficulties, but other people should not have to accommodate you when your situation changes. Especially a wedding when you're not the one getting married and are one guest out of dozens. \nI understand wanting to vent and how it escalated is not on you, next time just make sure to vent to better friends.", "YTA \n\n\"I didn't actually want to go to the wedding bad enough...\" right there.  You were definitely the AH before by except your friend to completely change her wedding plans for one person, but with that remark, it's way worse.   Your friend deserves a better friend. Good for her for cutting you out of her life.", "YTA. It's one thing to vent that your physical limitations mean that you can't attend. It is another to say that if she was a better friend she would get married somewhere else. I have a progressive illness that will limit what I can do in the future and has limited me in the past. I understand how it feels to be left out because your body is saying no. I understand how it feels when people can't or won't accommodate me. \n\nHowever, while it was wrong for the person you vented to spread this around, it is very na\u00efve to think that it wouldn't get out. It wasn't her fault you were injured, it wasn't her fault that her wedding was postpone, and it wasn't her fault that your abilities have changed. \n\nThe fallout caused people to have a go at her and she felt she had no choice than to elope. Your comment was the catalyst.", "\u201cOr if I\u2019m even in the wrong\u201d you are. You really really are. And she was right to cut out contact with you and anyone who sided with you bc she realized she had a bunch of self absorbed narcissistic ahs for friends. First of all you don\u2019t have a say in a major aspect of someone else\u2019s event, especially something as big and personal as a wedding. And two, you had no right to complain about it to anyone. You caused this. You were manipulative and you got what you wanted, she didn\u2019t have her wedding at her dream place. Congrats.", "Soft YTA The main AH was the friend that spread what you said. You are allowed to have feelings and you were handling them properly: confiding in someone not close to the situation, i.e., not the bride.\n\nYou became a bit of the AH when you pushed it with the bride. You were somewhat set up by the real AH but you still needed to say something like \"it's your wedding so your feelings are more important than mine\" and then just left it at that.", "YTA.\n\nI feel like there is a ton of projection here. I don\u2019t think your anger was really about her choice of venue. I think it\u2019s more about your condition, the delay of your care, the loss of your abilities, and your lack of control over everything. \n\nEasier to focus on the venue, something changeable, then focus your feelings on your condition, something beyond your power. \n\nThat\u2019s a reason - not an excuse. It\u2019s never excusable to take pain out on loved ones. \n\nApologize to your friend even if it\u2019s not enough to save the relationship. It\u2019s the right thing to do. I would then look into therapy or support groups for people in your situation. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in so much pain.", "I think you need to put yourself in her shoes. If it was you going there and she was the one with medical probles what would you do? Would you just cancel the most important day of your life for a friend?  I think either way one of you would get hurt. I feel bad for the bride though. You will be missing a friends wedding day while she misses one of the best days of her life. What would you have her do? It seems she tried to get you there. It's a bad situation and now you are both hurt. Maybe a compromise now. Ask her out for a coffee date or something.

I need surgery from it but due to the healthcare system I\u2019ve been waiting for years and it\u2019s been getting worse. One of my best friend was suppose to be married in 2020 but due to the pandemic she had to push it to Oct 2022. So at that point I was still able to walk and she wanted to have it at a national park. The walk is about 2 km uphill to a waterfall and lake the walk has roots so I can\u2019t ride a wheelchair there. \n\nSo it\u2019s been over 2 years and I tell her a few months ago I probably can\u2019t make the walk. We brainstorm some other solutions but in the end it doesn\u2019t look like there isn\u2019t an easy way for me to attend. There was a guy friend coming that could help carry me but he moved countries and decided not to. She apologized but said it was her dream to get married at that waterfall and I said I understood but was definitely not happy about it since we had been friends for years and I expected to attend. \n\nI did say to a friend I wasn\u2019t happy with her choice of wedding venue and I wish she valued me enough to change it so I can go. I know when she made the plans I confirmed I could but I think she should be able to change plans since time has passed. That friend I was offloading to offloaded to the bridesmaids and people took sides. Some contacted the bride and told her to change the venue because they felt like I should be allowed to attend and others said it was planned for and I shouldn\u2019t expect it to change for me. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize how bad it got until the bride came back and accused me of trying to ruin her wedding. I said I just told a friend what I thought and I didn\u2019t go any further and she called me selfish and told me it was her wedding and the pandemic wasn\u2019t her fault so she couldn\u2019t control that in that time I\u2019d gotten worse. I told her she can\u2019t but if she had any compassion for me she\u2019s change it to somewhere I can go to and she hung up on me.\n\nShe then cancelled the wedding completely but I heard she basically eloped and got married to her fianc\u00e9 with only half the bridesmaids. The ones who defended me and argued with her said she cut them out of the wedding and have stopped talking to them. I feel really had now because I didn\u2019t actually want to go to the wedding badly enough to lose her as a friend but I didn\u2019t think she would cut us all off as a result.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Who are you to dictate terms?", "YTA.", "\n\n\"I did say to a mutual friend I wasn\u2019t happy with her choice of wedding venue and I wish she valued me enough to change it so I can go. \"\n\nYTA.  Why didn't you value her enough to be happy she was getting her dream venue?", "Wow yeah YTA", "YTA.", "Wait though, you didn\u2019t want to go bad enough to end a friendship but you still wanted her to upend her wedding to cater to you?\n\nI\u2019m confused and YTA", "YTA. How fucking selfish can you be to make someone else's WEDDING DAY about you. You should feel bad. You're a shitty person. You sure she was your friend?", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry for what\u2019s happened to you, it\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, just like the pandemic isn\u2019t either (in this event). \n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t give you the right to demand someone else change their wedding. It was ok to ask, but you needed to accept the \u2018no\u2019 and not bitch about it. The wedding isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your friend.", "YTA this had nothing to do with you, it was her wedding her day not yours. If you are all good friends like you said you had to know if you told that particular friend then she would get the ball rolling. Unfortunately for y'all it turned into a boulder.  I'm disabled and I have told my own children that whatever their dream is, that's what I want for them. Even if it means I can't be there. Weddings are about family and friends supporting TWO people start their journey. Not this friend or that friend. You made it about you and you never should have been a factor for or against location or anything else.", "[removed]", "YTA, nice way of losing a friend, the world doesnt resolve over you.", "YTA just know that you ruined her dream wedding over your selfishness of making everything about you.", "YTA for making it about you. But I'm confused why if there was one friend who could carry you, there wasn't another potential person to help do the same. Even if you hired some random athletic person to do it, that would have avoided all this drama.", "YTA. We can\u2019t always attend everything we would like to. But you should be happy enough for your friend to support her having the wedding on her terms. You caused a civil war and ruined the wedding she wanted. \n\nEngland has a tradition called \u201cregrets\u201d. They read cards and letters from people who are unable to attend. You should offer your congratulations, your regrets and your apologies. Cuz that friendship took some critical damage.", "YTA. I wanted to be angry that you made her wedding about you. But I understand you\u2019re hurt. You\u2019re allowed to be sad that you have to miss big things. It sounds like you\u2019re in a difficult and painful situation and probably have had to miss multiple things for reasons completely out of your control, and that your current life is a pretty big adjustment from your pre-accident life. That\u2019s really hard, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. \n\nBeing upset is okay, but you don\u2019t get to ask other people to change their plans because you\u2019re upset. Or question their feelings toward your friendship if that doesn\u2019t happen. Especially when your friend has also been dealing with a lack of control over a big thing in her life. It sounds like your friend spent a considerable amount of time showing she cares by brainstorming options with you. She was probably just as sad that you couldn\u2019t be there. There are a lot of times in life where you have to make a hard decision that makes you sad, but it\u2019s still the right decision.\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to heal soon.", "YTA\n\nYou are si self centred. Honestly how dare you. \n\n\nIf you have any decency you will be going round to the people sided with you and tell them how wrong you were.\n\nThe fact you even say in this post you aren't sure you did anything wrong is astounding.", "YTA. My best friend wedding was last month. I was dying to go for over a year they planned this. My mom had  areally bad surgery out of the blue. Should have I told her to cancel HER WHOLE DAMN WEDDING FOR MEEE.. HER BFF... the level of audacity. You are so dense... The wedding was about them.. NOT YOU.... YTA. A MAJOR ONE", "You're NTA, although I don't know that she is either. I think she was probably legitimately hurt by you not attending, but there are health reasons for you saying that. \n\nHopefully after everyone cools down, you guys can perhaps repair the friendship", "ESH\n\nYou said \"bridesmaids\", which tells me there were multiple people she chose as bridesmaids and you were not one of them, so while you may be good friends, you're not one of her best friends. Sorry if that sounds a bit harsh, but it seems to be the case. \n\nI think it is a whole lot of much to expect a friend to change her entire wedding plan around to accommodate you. Presumably you would have been able to join the reception at least? \n\nLike, I get that it sucks, but it also isn't about you. You were one of many guests and probably not the only one who was unable to go due to the location they chose. That's something the bride and groom probably thought a lot about and decided was a worthwhile price to pay to have the venue they wanted. I get that it hurts, but it is what it is. \n\nNow, the reason I went with ESH instead of Y T A is because it seems ridiculously overboard for her to have canceled the entire wedding and apparently ended multiple friendships over this. How old are all you ladies? Honestly... That is some super dramatic shit.", "NTA \n\nYou were venting to someone else in confidence. That person is to blame at the end of the day because they were sharing your business all over the place. I think you do come off as a little self centered considering it is not your wedding but you weren't trying to get her to change venues or cancel the wedding. You did not intend for this to happen.", "Holy fuck, if one of my friends needed accommodations for any disability to attend my wedding, it would be a complete no-brainer to do whatever they needed.  Without the people you love, a wedding is just an overpriced, superficial photo shoot.\n\nNTA, and that \"friend\" disgusts me.  I don't care how many downvotes I get - you don't fuck over friends like that, and you don't fuck over people who are disabled like that, without being an asshole.", "ESH - plain and simply.", "This is the weirdest post.", "She'd already had her wedding plans completely disrupted by Covid, where was OP's compassion for her? OP is obviously in a shitty situation, but it's not pleasant to have to cancel and delay your wedding by 2 years. Then OP soured it by turning guesrs against her we'd plans. The guests of honour at a wedding are the bride and groom, the plans revolve around them, not OP.", "No data reception at that location", "Yeah but that's also why I say ESH. The people who pressured the bride, the ones who organized the wedding, all of them could have looked into a way to get OP to the spot instead of stirring the pot.", "Are they even as close as OP is suggesting? I think it\u2019s weird that OP considers her \u201cone of [OP\u2019s] best friends\u201d but doesn\u2019t seem to be an actual bridesmaid.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

YTA", "yeah this crossed my mind as well. I have a friend with a pretty significant physical disability who has been in similar situations though (ie being very close friends with someone but wasn't in the bridal party). She's in a wheelchair, and there have been a variety of reasons as to why she's not been in the bridal party, but she's always invited and we always find ways for things to be accessible."]}
