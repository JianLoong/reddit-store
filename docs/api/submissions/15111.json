I realize that you wouldn't like this arrangement, but you also have to consider this from another angle. Emily is basically creating a hostage situation. She gets to take over the family television whenever she likes, and doesn't have to share her PS5 with her sisters, or else she will just stay with her father permanently.\n\nSo, it's either you exercise authority over this situation, or your home will be under the despotic control of a 14-year-old. Because it won't be long, if it hasn't happened already, that Emily will realize that she can do whatever she wants under the threat of moving in with her father permanently.\n\nIn your place, honestly, I'd tell her to go ahead and do it if that's what she wants.\n\nNTA.", "YTA.\n\nIt was a gift to your daughter from your ex.\n\nAre you prepared to replace it if one of the other kids break it?\n\nImo, it is wrong to force someone to share a gift, and by forcing the issue, you will not be teaching her to share.  You will be teaching her that her authority figures use their power to control her and her belongings.\n\nSo let's say ava's dad gets you an expensive piece of jewelry as a gift maybe $2K, something ava has always wanted and has mentioned when you wear it around her.  So should YOU be forced to share an expensive gift with ava or not to wear it where ava can see it, simply because she wants it?  But you were wearing it when you were around her in a shared space so it is open for anyone to demand to use.   See how that works?   Wouldnt feel good to not have control over your own gifts & belongings due to the wants of someone else.\n\nOr maybe when emily turns 16 and you guys decide to buy her a car?  Should she be FORCED to share with Ava anytime Ava wants to drive it because the car is parked in a shared space?  I realize cars are a bit diff due to insurance but the point is, at some point kids need to understand that they cannot always have what they want, it is a lesson life teaches us \n\nTo me a more reasonable solution would be to have her or her dad buy a tv or monitor and put it in her room so she can play there and not take over the shared tv, or to not allow her to bring gifts into the house that SHE is unwilling to share.", "YTA. It's her PS5. She can take it to her dad's, so she should, and just stay there. She is not obligated to share with her step siblings.", "NTA.  If she doesn't want to share the console (which is selfish, but her prerogative IMO) then she shouldn't have to.  However, the rest of the family shouldn't then have to share the TV with her in order to allow her to flaunt her gift.  If she doesn't have a TV of her own to use, or you don't allow the kids to have their own TVs, then set a time limit for her to use the console on her own, so that she isn't preventing the other kids from using the shared TV.  Perhaps make an allowance of more time, if the extra time is spent with all of the kids playing the game together.", "Final edit: Apparently OP left out a lot of information that has nothing to do with this post but creates a broader narrative that she, in fact, does not treat her kids equally. All these suppressive downvotes forced me to read through additional comments to figure out where the hell people were coming from. I'll change my judgement from N T A to YTA because she omitted sensible info that better explains why Emily wouldn't want to share. OP your doubly an AH for making me spend more time to figure out what you left out.\n\n~~Edit: Downvote me all you want. Parental differential treatment is a real thing. Let's not pretend that allowing one sibling to have unequal treatment under that same roof is a good thing. It's perfectly possible to navigate this scenario by being fair to everyone. Is OP there yet? No. Is it fair to allow one daughter to hog the living room TV? No. Is it fair to allow the other girls unhindered access to Emily's PS5? No. Parenting rarely involves a quick solution to a problem. So glad to know people will think I'm an AH too when I try to teach my kids about compromising skills. Gotta love Reddit.~~\n\n~~NTA~~\n\n~~For starters, to anyone saying Y T A because Emily has a rich dad and it's her stuff, not the family's, is looking at this too narrowly. Yes the PS5 is Emily's and she can share as she wishes. Yes the other kids aren't entitled to Emily's things. At the same time, Emily is 14 and when you have a household where one child gets treated better than the other children, you risk harming all your children's own development. The easiest solution is to not allow the PS5 in the house, and have it at your ex's house. If it HAS to be in your home then Emily should be required to share it on some level. The lessons learned from sharing are well worth being called an AH by your ex and your daughter.~~\n\n~~The hardest part will be convincing Emily why it's important to share, or at the very least not boast nice things in front of others. That's a lesson she should have learned from a younger age, but better late than never.~~\n\nStole this from online, \"*Children need to learn to share so they can make and keep friends, play cooperatively, take turns, negotiate and cope with disappointment.*\"\n\nThis is a good opportunity to teach, rather than dictate.", "NTA Send that thing back to dads house.

A lot of folks may find it more important for her to have control of her own items, but this is a perfect example of the benefits of setting expectations and teaching compassion. Let her know that she's not required to share, but if she uses the family tv she is expected to share the ps5. It's unkind to flaunt your good fortune. It's good for people to have some communal tendencies. That's not to say she has to share everything in her life, but if there's something that won't hurt her to share she should lean towards kindness and generosity. I would also monitor how she treats the other kids and if her father is trying to cause problems by flooding her with goods and letting her know she's better than the others because of his resources. Have some ongoing conversations with all the kids about the traits that are important to your family and how they should treat others and what are appropriate boundaries.", "You have three daughters who live in the same household. NTA for *asking* them to share, particularly since the television is shared among all the family. (However, as the PS5 was gifted to a specific child, she can say that she does not want to share.

This is probably best managed by setting limits on devices / gaming in general, such as with an hour a day, and consider softening the limits if they are sharing, to encourage that behavior. But don't set different rules for different people in the household.  \n\n\n~~NTA, specifically because of the fact that her use of the device dominates the shared TV and impacts others' access to it. As a family you need to figure out the rules around sharing~~ *~~shared~~* ~~devices, and as the parents you take the lead in setting those rules. You obviously aren't TA for having rules that prevent Emily from making it so that no one else can use the TV!~~\n\n~~Obviously this could escalate...in the future her dad might just buy her a tv so she is able to use the PS5 without using the 'family' tv at all - but you aren't obligated to let her install it anywhere or to use household electricity and wi-fi to enable it. Hopefully this doesn't evolve in that way however, as that would create a wedge with her family. Work with Emily if you can on what works in your household. Is she willing to allow her siblings to use the device EVER or is she dead set against that? She should understand that being in your family means following certain rules to treat the others in the family well, and 'hoarding' things like this just because she can is not meeting that expectation.~~\n\n~~Also do you have a relationship with her dad in which you can reach some agreement here?

It doesn\u2019t matter that the PS5 is more expensive. If you wanted to instill sharing as an important principle, you  need to be consistent across children with it, regardless of price.

There\u2019s two options for that: tv or ps5 goes to her dads. You already forbade the first one.

You\u2019re favoring the children of your husband over Emily, likely because of your own personal gripes with him.

It seems like you\u2019re more angry about the fact that she\u2019s not sharing a gift that was specifically for her.\n\nIn one of your comments you said that Emily used to ask her sisters to share, and now she doesn\u2019t believe in sharing. That\u2019s not her fault! It\u2019s probably because she saw how others didn\u2019t have to share, and now she believes she doesn\u2019t have to (which in this case she absolutely does not have to share with her sisters, as she was never given the same respect).

He\u2019s trying to make up for lost time and 14 years worth of missed birthdays \u2014 meanwhile, had he known about Emily, would have probably just gotten her a Nintendo as well (or certainly paid enough in child support to have covered the cost of one).\n\nYou should let her keep the PS5 at her dad\u2019s house\u2026 along with her.
