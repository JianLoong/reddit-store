M and F don\u2019t have any children together, they have children from previous marriages and thats that. \n\n\nA little while ago however due to money problems, they had to sell M\u2019s 3 wheel \nmotorcycle, one of M\u2019s sons 51 M, who well call Paul, who hardly speaks to M said \u201cstop selling all of my inheritance\u201d, on top of never calling or visiting them unless he needs something. \n\n\nAs a child I always told M and F that I loved their house, it\u2019s a one bedroom one bathroom house with a cute porch and swing out back along with 2 small sheds and a tiny painting studio M build for F. I loved how small it was and how homey it felt. \n\n\nI\u2019d hear all the time from them \u201coh well OP says she loves our house\u201d whenever they were upset because they were slowing down on the upkeep on the house because of their age. Which we did help with when we had the chance, my brothers and dad would always go over and help them with housework. \n\n\nSo after the argument with Paul about them \u201cselling his inheritance\u201d I guess they took it as taking him out of the will. Which no one knew about. It wasn\u2019t until they passed that we found out they left the house to me.\n\n\nAs you can probably assume. Paul, was livid, he claimed he needed the house to sell it so he could keep living well (the house in its condition was about $65,000 at most which yes is a lot of money) saying he quit his job because he was going to live off of that money. I won\u2019t have much of a use for the house right now but for now I plan on fixing it up and renting it out. But he said I should just let him live there for free now since he doesn\u2019t have the money anymore. I obviously said no.\n\n\nOur families got into a huge argument over this because he never came around until he needed something. He lives in Ohio and we live in Pennsylvania so it\u2019s not like they were states away, a visit every now and then wasn\u2019t as big of a hassle as he made it seem, especially for his dad. \n\n\nAnyways. I\u2019m now getting threats from him and his wife saying they\u2019re going to sue me because they think I pressured M and F into taking him off their will and putting me as the sole beneficiary. And is saying I \u201cstole his inheritance\u201d So AITA?", "created_utc": 1670459092, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfj8hq/aita_for_stealing_someone_elses_inheritance/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
