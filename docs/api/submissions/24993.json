We started talking, and we got to a point where we said we would meet, and somehow the meet converted to just meeting in a hotel room. We met in the room itself for the very first time, and we did the deed. After that, she broke off contact, saying that we should not have done everything that fast.\n\nFast forward a year, I'm living in a different city. She approaches me on LinkedIn, saying she lost my contact and asked for my WhatsApp, so I gave it. We started talking and decided to catch up on a Friday night. During conversation, it slips out that I cook on most Fridays, she invited herself over to my apartment to eat some homemade food, knowing very well what was going to happen after as she made some plans to stay over.\n\nBut this time around, we did a lot more talking, and it came out that we had nothing in common. I have a small library in my room and a few paintings that I like to talk about, as a hobbyist writer and painter, they are my passion. She's into pop culture, doesn't read, listens to reductionist songs, and watches the worst kind of soap operas. I am coming off as elitist, sorry.I felt like we had nothing to discuss.\n\nShe's also very insecure and constantly talks about her body. Once, I complimented her on going to a good college, and she mentioned how my mom would be proud if I married someone who went to such a college - weird.\n\nOne thing led to another, but I just couldn't do it this time. I found her unattractive because we couldn't talk about anything meaningful. So, I made up an excuse about having unprotected sex recently and needing to get tested. \n\nShe left soon after and none of us brought up the point about staying over, but figured out that I was lying and keeps asking me why I didn't want to do anything with her this time.\n\nI can just say we're incompatible, but since we had done it before and almost did it again, I don't think she'll buy it.\n\nSo, AITA for not telling the girl why I didn't want to sleep with her?\n\n**TLDR:** Met up with a girl after a breakup, we ended up sleeping together once, but on the second meeting, I found her unattractive due to lack of common interests. I lied about why I didn't want to sleep with her again, and now she wants to know the real reason. AITA for not telling her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How does that happen? Did you get to have any input in that happening or did you just kinda accept your fate? It's a bit weird, honestly.

The rest of your interpretation is all on you.", "Likewise", "Someone of such high intellectual prowess would NEVER use such a reductionist word as \u201cnormie\u201d. How churlish of you.", "How is \u201cI will lie, you will catch me in the lie and then I will still gaslight you\u201d kind and smart? Instead of saying \u201chey, I just don\u2019t feel emotional connection due to lack of shared interests\u201d? \n\nTo me it is simply cowardly and a bit socially awkward. \n\nI can guarantee that the poor girl not knowing is gonna make her doubt herself and think of far worse reasons. \n\nBe kind.", "You\u2019re not responsible for placating her insecurities, at least she would have an answer. It\u2019s okay to not feel like you\u2019re compatible- you don\u2019t have to go into detail about it. Her insecurities are her journey to work on, but it really is nice to hear that something isn\u2019t gonna work out and it shows you respect her enough to be honest.", "You can tell her the truth without your judgmental opinions (which you\u2019re entitled to).\n\nEg. \u2018Hey, I think you deserve someone who would introduce you to their mom, and I realized it\u2019s not me. I didn\u2019t want to use you for sex, it felt wrong when I know I don\u2019t want more. I hope you understand and find the right person for you. Take care\u2019\n\nIf she asks why not you etc. Just say I\u2019m not in the right place for a relationship and honestly we don\u2019t have much in common to get into one with each other. It would\u2019ve been just sex and it didn\u2019t feel good to do that to someone.\n\nDo NoT say she\u2019s uncultured, you have intellectual superiority lol, she\u2019s insecure etc. That\u2019s all unnecessary, and natural for her to go through. You\u2019re right she doesn\u2019t need to hear that, those are your opinions - not facts.\n\nNAH\n\nYou would be the AH now cause she\u2019s waiting for you to be tested and reschedule or vaguely aware you lied and can over think it.", "You realized you had not much in common and a relationship was unlikely so sleeping with her after that would feel like taking advantage of her and you didn't want to do that to her.\n    \n I don't see how that would hurt her feelings more than suddenly not being interested in sex with her. Presumably she is thinking you don't find her attractive right now.", "NTA, OP. However there are two things that don't sit right - what do you mean by 'she knew what was going to happen if she stayed over', and why do you hang out with women you aren't interested in?\n\nOne, sounds strange, as if you'd expect sex if a woman hangs out with you.\n\nTwo, you knew the person wasn't interesting to you, you've had your little thing before and it didn't turn out to be what you wanted. Why give someone your number, entertain them, have them over etc. if you aren't interested in them?", "If you're not worried about your OWN self esteem, you could say you're on some medication which has caused some erectile dysfunction and you didn't want to show yourself up on the night? Still a lie but at least she's not as hurt.", "Telling the truth might help her, making up a lie won't help at all. I'll say NAH but you should just man up and be honest with her.", "I mean, no one wants to be rejected, so it might make her feel insecure. You shouldn't sleep with someone just to save their feelings, though, unless you plan on sleeping with them indefinitely, robbing them of the opportunity to find someone who actually likes them (pretty extreme but if you don't like someone who likes you, you either hurt them or marry them). I think telling them their tastes are reductionist and that their hobbies are beneath you would probably hurt her a lot more. If you really want to say something, you can tell her you just feel you don't have shared interests and leave it at that, but I don't think that's really necessary", "Lying was obviously worse, it served no purpose other than to protect you. In these situations people are lying to avoid an awkward situation not because they are benevolent.", "I just googled it, and reductionism as a music genre sounds way more interesting and sophisticated than the stupid shit I listen to. \n\nI was thinking he meant pop music but \u2026???", "How do you see it as projecting when you recognised in your own post that you\u2019re coming off as elitist? That\u2019s what that means, and your readers happen to agree with you.", "You literally say you\u2019re coming across as elitist in your post. You can\u2019t accuse people of projecting when you literally anticipated how your comments sounded and apologized for it. Sorry, but that boat sailed.", "[deleted]", "He still shouldn't have to jump through these hoops.. frankly who knows who she'll tell, no good deed goes unpunished these days. That and as an adult, neither of them owe the other the obligation to set themselves on fire to keep the other warm.. yes, that applies for the man", "Hahaha, she knows I used to be on SSRIs, maybe I can say that I'm back on them and the side effects have kicked in.", "I think he probably did mean pop music with simple lyrics, not realising that reductionist was a genre.", "Pretty sure OP never heard of the genre and used the word as a fancy way of saying shallow pop shite.\n\nReductionist is the word people who think they are smart use to tell others they're not on the same intellectual level cause they are lacking complexity and nuance.", "Sounding elitist is not the same as being elitist.", "No, he acknowledged that he sounded elitist. Good for him for liking what he likes", "If you don't want to hurt her and will never see her again, just explain about the non compatibility and say you're back on meds - then you're sorted. It's always going to cause a bit of pain to say 'i don't like you' essentially to someone, but hey you can't hide from everything!", "I wouldn't lie if I were you OP, you don't have to tell her the truth, but don't lie either. lying can and will snowball into something much bigger, and she'll find out eventually like how she found about you're pervious lie", "Don't add second different lie. Tell her the truth you realized you aren't compatible long term and that you are looking for something different. This doesn't put her down and can help her in the future to find someone who has same hobbies as her."]}
