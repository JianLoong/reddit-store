A friend invited me to a dinner party at her house a few weeks ago, the actual dinner party was last night. I asked if I should bring anything, but she said no, it\u2019s not a potluck, she\u2019ll be making dinner for everyone. There were 7 of us total and the food was good. During the mea we were all laughing and called our friend (dinner host) a chef cause she made a big dinner for all of us and we al said how much we appreciated it because it\u2019s hard to get everyone together at the same time. \n\nAt the end of dinner we all help clean, was the dishes, then have some wine. It started getting late so people started to head out, and on our way out the dinner host said don\u2019t forget to Venmo/cash app/ zelle her. Some of us were confused because we had no idea what we had to send her. So I ask her \u201cwhat am I sending you money for\u201d and she said for cooking dinner. \n\nMe: I don\u2019t understand why we should pay?\n\nHer: because I spent my money and hosted the dinner and cooked.\n\nMe: None of us asked you to, you volunteered to do it and you never mentioned paying until now.\n\nHer: I didn\u2019t do this for free\n\nMe: you should\u2019ve told us before you hosted that you expected this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to just bring this up and expect people to pay.\n\nShe called me an asshole and said again that she didn\u2019t spend hours to cook, grocery shop for free. I have never heard of this. Like ever. We kept arguing and after a while I just Venmo\u2019d her the $40 she asked for. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole at all and some of my friends agree with me. Some have said it\u2019s normal to pay for dinner during a dinner party at someone\u2019s house, so now I\u2019m not sure.\n\nEdit: A lot of you have asked what she made, and it was some salad I\u2019ve never heard of, the main course was smoked gouda mashed potatoes with beef short ribs. A desert I forgot the name of (I think she said she bought this from a bakery). She also made vegan mash potatoes and vegan \u201cribs\u201d for one of our friends who is vegan. She also made (bought?) chicken skewers as the appetizer. \n\nEven though she said not to bring anything, I brought rum cake from my local bakery. And yes, everyone brought something small. We also had charcuterie and cheese board that two of the girls brought. Some girls brought wine and we even had one girl bring candles to set the mood. \n\nWe are in the US and none of are European. I spoke with some of the others and although they had paid for a dinner party before, it was discussed first. No one has ever done what this friend did which was spring an unexpected cost on us. \n\nAll of us are in our early 30s.\n\nThe group chat is going crazy right now because everyone is pissed at her.", "created_utc": 1678303017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m58wu/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_dinner/", "score": 1405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she was going to ask for payment that would have been the time do mention it.

Except $40 a plate and surprise fees, you better have damn good food/service if you want customer retention.", "It's kind of like if you get a dinner invitation and it turns out to be an Amway party.
