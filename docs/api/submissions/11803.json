If she was going to ask for payment that would have been the time do mention it.

If you invite people over for dinner, the guests do NOT pay for it--that's what restaurants are for! If she expected her ~~guests~~ customers to pay for the honor of eating her food, she needed to say so up front and name the amount at that time so everyone could decide whether they wanted to go or no. All of that should be made very clear at the time the invitation is sent, not later, and certainly not at the end of the evening as people were leaving. This is so very clearly someone trying to make money off her friends and it's really shitty.\n\nIf she ever goes you any kind of get-together at your place in the future, make sure to hit her with an unexpected bill for $40 on her way out the door and see how she likes it.", "NTA, but your hopefully ex-friend sure is. No, it is NOT normal to offer to host and then demand payment. She is ridiculously out of line here.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing that makes the hostess's behavior possibly make sense is maybe a cultural misunderstanding? This happened to me in a different country - I was invited to a dinner where everyone paid the host, and I had no idea that was going to be a thing and no one told me because it was assumed I knew.

It\u2019s not a potluck, so it\u2019s not like she gave y\u2019all an option to contribute.

Nope. Not unless a whole group wants somewhere to do an event and one person agrees to have their place be the venue but everyone has to chip in for drinks and food, but then it's known right from the suggestion that it's a shared cost.
