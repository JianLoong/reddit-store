When I got married we had kids and it was the best memories of our wedding. My MOH was 9 months pregnant and there were probably 20 kids ranging in age from newborn to teens. All kids were super well behaved during the ceremony and partied/danced with everyone well into the night. There was a room in our venue where parents could go if they needed a break or to breastfeed and the teens took over keeping an eye on the toddlers in that room where the was a tv where everyone could watch movies and we made snacks available.

It was clear, even for your cousin - no kids. How hard is to understand?

May your marriage be blessend and happy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe she thought I bring the kids thinking that you would give in, cuz you are in front of the whole familiy.

The rule was clear, and clearly communicated in advance. There's all sorts of good reasons to have a child free wedding, but most importantly in a case like this, is simply that it's what the bride and groom want.
