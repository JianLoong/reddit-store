I dont know why some people think their kids are their golden ticket to do whatever they want.", "NTA Hindsight is 20/20 but it's a shame you didn't have a person designated to deal with unexpected problems so that you didn't have to.", "NTA! She blatantly disrespected you after you clearly told her your rules and was quite understanding about the situation.  She disrupted your wedding and your NTA no matter what your family say.  It's your wedding!", "NTA, your wedding day, your special day, you make the rules, if they cannot follow them then you were 100% within your rights to say no.  \n\n\nI would not have let it spoil the day as you did, I would say now they were there that they could stay for the service but would then have to leave.", "NTA. The rules were clear. You were polite when you said you'd like family there but understood if she wouldn't be able to come. She FAFO because she thought she could get away with breaking the rules.", "NTA it would be disrespectful if you made an exception for her considering I\u2019m sure other people also had kids but found a way to get someone to watch their kids so they could attend. It seems a little entitled of her to think she can be the only one allowed to break the rules and get away with it. You definitely did the right thing and I hope your wedding went smoothly after she was told to leave.", "NTA. Did she not RSVP no? \n\nIn that case she's doubly an asshole. Once for deciding rules didn't apply to her and once for going back on her rsvp, because you paid for so many plates and would have had 3 extra mouths.", "No", "NTA!! Not even a tiny bit. You have every right to have a child free wedding. I suspect those who say you're the AH don't agree with that.                                                                                                          How does it get any more obnoxious, entitled and outright rude than to show up with 2 kids in tow when you've already argued with the bride and been told, in no uncertain terms, that the kids were not invited? The topping is that they are 3 & 4, that's too young even if you were including some younger cousins.", "NTA. The cousin was beyond entitled and deserves to be kicked out!", "NTA: So glad you didn\u2019t let her get away with that BS. Good on you!!", "You absolutely did the right thing! I'm glad you felt comfortable doing so. She's an arrogant asshole who needed to be treated that way.", "You\u2019re not the AH. I feel like, you\u2019re wedding day is your day. If you have clear rules, then it is what it is, especially if everyone is initially okay with it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA this was your big day and she knew the rules but decided that the rules just didn't apply to her - she owes you an appology for delaying your wedding", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding your rules.\n\nPersonally, I love when weddings have a no kids rule. That means I don\u2019t have to go!", "You don't need a space before the period. Please stop doing that.", "How could they get hurt? You do know that children attend wedding on a regular basis right? I know it is your wedding, your rules. I just don\u2019t understand this statement", "ETA. YTA for saying I want my family but no kids like the kids aren\u2019t part of your family. Cousin is TA for not following your rules.", "NTA. It is your wedding your rules. Your cousin is arrogant, thinking their needs and wants come before the person putting on the event. It is not like \"no kids\" weddings are a rarity.", "You are not the asshole. Your wedding, your rules. Everyone else managed to follow the rules.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  You made your rule perfectly clear, and she ignored it.", "NTA, you laid out rules and she ignored them. What did she expect??", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  You clearly stated that children were excluded from the wedding.  It was your cousin's prerogative not to attend your wedding if she didn't agree with that provision or if she couldn't find child care.  But to show up with her kids in tow when she clearly knew better makes her an AH so you did what you had to do.  While some of your family may think you're an AH I think you probably set a good precedent for future family weddings where the bride and groom decide no children.", "NTA. You were crystal clear,with what to do and not to do at YOUR wedding,she doesn't gaf and does the thing you said wasn't allowed. She was very disrespectful", "NTA,", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t stand people who do the ask for forgiveness not permission. They think they can get away with anything.", "NTA! She had plenty of time to arrange for child care. She was trying to bully you.", "Nta", "NTA screw people who think rules don\u2019t apply to them.", "NTA, as ridiculous as I think a kid-free wedding is, it's your event, you're footing the bill, your rules.  She couldn't abide, she can't be surprised by the consequences.", "NTA she f ed around and she found out.  You make what you wanted clear she heard you and did what she wanted  anyway.  Well I really hope she thinks the next time", "NTA", "NTA!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA, but you should have had any attendants handle it.", "NTA\n\n1. Many weddings are not an event for children\n2. Its the bride and grooms CHOICE if there are going to be kids at the wedding and no one else's.\n3. She is allowed to not want a babysitter etc but you have the right to kick her out.", "NTA - a lot of people that have children try to make their children everyone else's responsibility", "NTA. She knew the rules, and thought she could get away with not following them. I'm glad you kicked her out if the wedding.", "NTA.", "And, said children would be escorted out beforehand!!!", "I also loathe the childfree movement... but OP set the boundaries and guest failed to respect... I am REALLY excited for when OP has kids and then understands why childfree is gross. Turns out kids are people...", "What would she even do if they got hurt?", "It's her wedding and she probably paid good money for the decor and such. Even if they didn't, who cares? OP is the one getting married, and she can invite/exclude whomever she wants. If you don't want to leave your kids at home, then don't go. \n\nNTA", "Why?", "I had one. I had denied a request from a bridesmaid to invite a plus-one (no one else had one) because she wanted to bring her girlfriend and come out to her whole family (who was attending my wedding) at the reception. NO. My wedding is not your coming-out party. Only me, her sister, and her sister's husband knew, so he acted as bouncer for the evening.", "The same people who bring an untrained pet and pretend it's a service animal or emotional support animal. Or show up wearing a white, lacy dress when they're not the bride.", "Spend a couple of days here and you'll discover this is common and not the worst thing in the slightest. I've hugely lost faith in humanity since joining.", "\"Scooter's at my wedding? - Not for much longer, Bro. Not fur much longer...\" xD", "Omg I\u2019ve never even considered the animal thing. Why haven\u2019t I heard more horror stories about that? I\u2019m sure there some Ah out there that have done this. Just imagine a little shitty dog and they\u2019re shitty owner destroying your wedding and then them trying to blame you saying \u201cit\u2019s discrimination\u201d ughhh", "I sense someone new to Reddit, or I've spent too much time on here. I remember reading a post where someone brought a large dog to a wedding or a similar event, then went wild when they were told to leave and take the pooch with them.", "There's one about a guy who, after an exhaustive big no from the sister, brings his pet racoon since they're good ol besties n couldn't figure out why he got kicked out his sisters wedding lol\nHe did put the little guy in a tux which makes everything better though right \ud83d\ude05\n(My honest opinion? I'd kill to see a racoon in a tux especially one I can pet but wouldn't take to a wedding \ud83d\ude06)"]}
