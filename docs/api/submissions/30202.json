Overhearing others having sex is for most people gonna be at least a bit awkward and something most people want to avoid. Most people, as you did, try to minimise noise. She can't demand you not to have sex. Idk what to say really. It just baffles me she would live with others and not be upfront about her awkwardness around it knowing most people have sex. Maybe she cant afford the luxury of living alone, but without that luxury you have to accept some sex noise in your life. I'll change my verdict. Good luck finding a solution.", "Since OP is the one engaging in sex, she gets to decide where she feels comfortable having it.

If we\u2019re ok with making the roommate uncomfortable because they\u2019re all adults and the bf lives there too, the same applies to OP and her parents.
