I think you guys need to have a sit down and explain to her that while you understand her discomfort, you don't share those discomforts and want to be able to do what you want because it is also yours and your boyfriend's home that you pay for aswell. Maybe also try getting her out of the house and find something she likes so that when she's out of the house, you guys have time to do what you need without accommodating to her. Remember, both you and your boyfriend great friends for even trying to be respectful whether she disagrees or argues with you.", "NTA. You are going out of your way to keep it private. It can be uncomfortable for your roommate, but at the end of the day what you do in your room is your business. Do what you can to be respectful, but you can\u2019t make it go away. You have a right to live your life and enjoy yourself in your personal space.", "Buy her some noise cancelling headphones", "NTA- it\u2019s his place as much as it is hers so she can\u2019t be the one to dictate whether or not he has sex in his own room.", "NTA, so basically if she's uncomfortable then that's a her problem, otherwise yea like I don't really see a problem here, she's just uncomfortable just leave it as a past matter or do it while she sleeps", "Noise canceling wireless earbuds have been here for quite a while.   It's 2023. You don't need to hear anything you don't want to.", "NTA, headphones are a thing", "Tell her to buy headphones and mind her own business", "She can leave the house. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re going above and beyond to be considerate of her feelings by putting on music, using pillows to muffle the noise, and being extremely quiet during the act, which I\u2019m sure can be difficult at times. If you were doing this in a shared space or like dorm room, then it would be a different situation, but you\u2019re in your partners room\u2026in the place he also pays. I hate to ask, but I think it is worth considering. Is your bestie always uncomfortable with sex no matter the person, or is she just uncomfortable with you two having sex? If her discomfort is something new and targeted at just the two of you, then I\u2019d be asking deeper questions.", "NTA, you\u2019re treating it a lot nicer than most would, you both have the right to have sex, coming from someone who is also horribly grossed out by it, if you even think someone else is doing thing there\u2019s stuff you can do to ignore/not hear it. I grew up my whole life hearing my parents VERY loudly fucking which made me horribly uncomfortable, to which they said it\u2019s our house we can do what we want. It\u2019s called putting in your own music and blasting that shit. But it also seems they might have some trauma towards it or fear, therapy for them could be helpful.", "NTA\n\nLike so many others have already said, she's being ridiculous. She can have an aversion to sex, that's her business. But she needs to live alone if she can't handle sharing a home with a sexually active person. Unless of course she's up for having an 80+ year old roommate. \n\nYou can get noise cancelling earphones/headphones for an inexpensive amount of money, if I were you i'd likely offer them to her as a gesture of goodwill but make sure that's as far as your goodwill goes. You're already putting in more effort to not disturb her than she is putting in to not be disturbed.", "Your boyfriend is allowed to have sex in his own home, if she never leaves the house then there are no opportunities when she isn't around, what are you supposed to do? Never be intimate?\n\nIf it really bothers her that much she can put in some earbuds or leave.", "NTA- Sex is a perfectly natural normal thing. ~ Mr.Levenstien", "NTA. It\u2019s Your private room. She\u2019s clearly got issues that SHE needs to address.", "NTA. Reply to her text with a link to a place she can buy noise cancelling headphones.", "NTA, I would say she just has the ick from the idea of it and you\u2019re going out of your way to be respectful. If you were like banging in the living room then that would be different but you\u2019re in a room and literally using pillows to muffle sounds. This does put you in an awkward position though of saying, \u201chey, this is my bf house too and we have sex and we\u2019re being quiet and respectful with it\u201d. For that part you\u2019re going to have to put the awkwardness behind and just be straight up or you could just not address it.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing plenty to prevent her from hearing it, but at the end of the day people have sex in their homes and she needs to accept that.", "her comfort is not your concern, it\u2019s not like your having sex in front of her; you\u2019re taking measures to make it less obvious. other people live there too and the world does not revolve around her, NTA", "As a person really not comfortable with sex due to some trauma from when I was 12 by my half sister's father, NTA.

Your friend really needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\ncontinue to assert dominance by having sex in front of her until you have a 3some\n\n... I need to stop watching porn", "NTA. Her discomfort is not your problem, you are going above and beyond to make it quieter with her in mind. My neighbour's have loud sex in the middle of the night. It's uncomfortable to listen to but they are in their own part of the building and my discomfort is not their problem. \n\nIt's not like you're fucking in the kitchen", "NTA. Tell her to put on some earphones or leave\u2026 this is the real world where sex exists- if your attempts to reduce the noise isn\u2019t enough for her then this is her issue and it\u2019s on her to deal with it. \n\nIf she has earphones she can put them to good use. Or she can leave the apartment. Or stay and deal with it. Or move out. You\u2019ve been more than accommodating already.", "NTA\n\nHaving a roommate isn't always fun, but it's part of having one. If she has that big of an issue, she should rent alone.", "I think it wld be a problem if u were spending time with her and suddenly left her to bang. But, if it ain't that it shldnt matter what u do iyn ur own time", "Ohh my knee motto hahaha", "Nah thats her fault she can get over it or move", "NTA, both are adults and share a living place. I had a roomate who screamed like he was dying.", "NTA. Her trauma doesn't give her the right to hold your sex life hostage.", "NTA.

She is either asexual or is jealous of your boyfriend. You can ask her to a dinner friend date and broach the subject again but start with saying \u201cwe will be having sex and as you know sound travels here. How would you like to handle this moving forward? Would you like a notification (text, tie on the door, etc) so you can prepare or leave or what do you think?\u201d", "NTA- She has to be lying about hearing you. If you're not vocal and your headboard isn't slamming the wall, with a whole room separating you? No way. I'm not saying she's lying about sex scaring her, I'm saying she doesn't like the idea of him having sex with you because she wants a relationship with him. I don't think she can hear you at all.", "NTA.  You're already trying to be considerate.  If your bf is paying rent, he's allowed to use his space how he wants.  And I suspect even if you aren't doing the tango in there, she'll suspect you are if you're in there.

She probably feels excluded and uncomfortable", "NTA \nYou can't just stop having intimacy with your partner because of her. I think you should try to get her a bf and get her used to having sex lol. Or what i meant to say is her bf gets her used to sex.", "Living with your parents and having sex is crazy", "Next time don't muffle the sound so she can see how much effort you're putting into her not hearing anything.\n\nAlso, have you tried taking her out and introducing her to a few guys?

It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being disruptive, in fact you seem overly accommodating to her. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal for two adults to have sex. Don\u2019t let her hang ups and insecurity make you think otherwise. If she doesn\u2019t like it she can leave. \n\nMaybe start being less apologetic towards her and ignore texts like that. It\u2019s super creepy to text someone while you know they are having sex. \n\nYou might even consider silencing your phone and replying later \u201cno I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Then refuse to entertain the topic further.", "NTA, if she was really uncomfortable with it, she should step out and let you guys have privacy if it really bothers her or get headphones or play some music  in her room or something.

Thats on their parents and their lack of therapy.", "Heh dictate", "Yup I feel like there comes a point where this person is so ready to be upset by it that they\u2019re actively searching for it without even realizing and so it\u2019s not hard to see why they think the one thing all humans have in common (we fuck) is the problem because it avoids taking responsibility.", "Or she may have some trauma in her past regarding sex. Either way OP is NTA.", "Cant knock the rizz", "It's an interesting arrangement, for sure.", "And the best friend never leaves her room?  \n\nDang, it is not easy to be best friends with a hermit.

If not, is she (the friend) uncomfortable because she likes the boyfriend?", "That\u2019s what I was thinkin", "Maybe the best friend has a thing for the BF but has never said anything about it. Hence why sex bothers them.", "Exactly what I thought. Everyone is calling her an AH but for all we know it\u2019s uncomfortable bc it\u2019s triggering. I mean not even being able to hear someone talk about it? Also, although she is trying very hard not to make noise, do people not realize how loud you have to be to not only hear them OVER MUsIC but TWO rooms away?", "Yea if simply not having a victim mentality was that easy then why would anyone choose to be one?

Probably how they became friends.", "How's she going to move in with herself?", "This exactly. Something is deeply wrong with that girl.\n\nNot wanting to have sex? Totally normal.\n\nDon't like thinking about sex between two close friends? Sure, totally fair. Bodies are weird, sex is messy, it's kinda icky. I sympathize. I have friends I sure don't want to think about doing the horizontal Super Smash Bros.\n\nBut being so uncomfortable you don't want someone *who lives there* to have sex in *their own private portion* of the same building? Girl, you need to seek *help*. That is not even close to a normal or rational response.\n\nI'm trying to think of an analogy and I just can't. I was going to say it would be like forbiding a roommate from having a pet tarantula in their room if you are afraid of spiders.
