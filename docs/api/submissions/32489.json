She gives me an evil look, and I said what? When she says FUCKING MOVE screaming it she goes downstairs and I just asked why are you yelling at me? I did nothing to you my friend just had to use the bathroom. She continues to say well you know I\u2019m cleaning the bathroom and I said I didn\u2019t know I just woke up. Later on she\u2019s still trying to argue and my father still not doing anything about it. she continues to run her mouth and then I said JUST STOP I scream loud, and then she scream louder than me SHUT THE FUCK UP THEN she says and then storms into the basement then I wait for my friend to come to the bathroom And how she comes out we\u2019re walking down the stairs to go into my room which is in the basement she comes storming up the stairs saying YOU CAN FUCKING GO LEAVE MY HOUSE \n\nI laughed because I\u2019m more than happy to do that so I called my mother and tell her what happened and my mother was fuming and pissed And in which my mother responds be ready in 25 minutes I\u2019m coming to pick you up we both say goodbye, and I hang up my friend asked me what is your stepmother\u2019s problem I replied i don\u2019t even know my father than screams down the stairs WELL MAYBE STOP TALKING ABOUT IT THEN I replied back what? Then he says you keep fucking going stop it\u2019s not even serious then I reply maybe I wouldn\u2019t have been talking about it at this moment if you had your wife under control which then he goes silent. About five minutes later, I\u2019ll tell my friend to put on her shoes were going down to the park and waiting for my mom. My friend put on her shoes I put on mine and grab all my stuff to pack that I brought from my moms and as soon as I\u2019m about to leave my Father stopped me saying this what you wanted good job u got want u wanted. I completely ignore him and slam the door.

Your dad is whipped, and if he had any care for you he would have put his wife in her place for speaking to you that way. Good job on standing up to both of them and leaving.", "NTA\n\nI read the automod \"why do you think etc.\" comment, and uhhhh wow, that is not acceptable behavior from your dad or stepmom? Parents shouldn't shout at their kids (bio or otherwise) for no reason, and demanding an undeserved apology from a sixteen-year-old is bizarre. I'm glad your mom has your back.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry your dad doesn\u2019t defend you.", "NTA your father needs to grow TFU!!!!!!!!!", "NTA I would not return to your father\u2019s house. He can see at neutral locations without the stepmom.", "I still go to my fathers house because I love and do want to spend time with my dad and yes, we\u2019ve had addressed the issues multiple times And we have done it properly even had a sit down with my mom and my stepmom but my Step mom just acts like a victim in every single situation regarding the way she has treated me. And you\u2019re 100% right I do have the decision I\u2019ve already should\u2019ve done something I know I plan on having something done with custody this month. There has been times where I haven\u2019t been to my fathers house in months but he started fucking up when I started not coming to his house no more and I had a conversation with him about why I haven\u2019t been to his house in months and he said that when I don\u2019t come to his house, it makes him feel \u201c unwanted by his daughter\u201d and in that moment I felt horrible, so I started coming back to his house more and I regret it", "first off I am hardly ever at my dads and my stepmother said that she doesn\u2019t want me cleaning the bathroom because she prefers when she does it because she does it \u201cbetter\u201d Second off there\u2019s nothing really else to the story I had no clue why she was in a pissy mood but that\u2019s just her all the time.", "Typical old person gaslighting teens", "YTA for making up details.", "His reasoning sounds like straight-up manipulation to me. 'Whoa is me, my wife is mean to my daughter and I don't do anything about it now she won't come see me, I'm the victum!'\n\nI would look into family therapy with your mothers help, someone educated in matters like this to help your father see your perspective. Hell, maybe it could even open your step mom up to being nicer, or at least, find the reasons why she acts this way towards you.", "I don't think I suggested you're at fault. I just stated that it seems like there's deeper issues here.", "Yikes. I simply stated that it seems like there are more issues in their relationship than this surface encounter. \n\nNot sure how that deserves downvotes.", "What details? I said it seems like there are bigger problems if the SM is just yelling at her all the time.", "I have a strong suspicion why she acts like this. I think it\u2019s because she married a guy who had a kid and then later realized in the relationship that she didn\u2019t want to marry a guy with a kid \ud83d\ude2d", "I never said you did suggest that I was at fault? There\u2019s really no deeper issue she just doesn\u2019t like me because of her own problems", "Obviously you've never lived in a house ruled by fear, where screaming is the norm. It's awful, especially when it has NOTHING to do with how much or little you do around the house, the screaming never stops.", "Whatever her reasoning, it\u2019s unwarranted and harmful to your mental health. If your father isn\u2019t going to stand up for you, you really do need to do what\u2019s best for you. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t feel guilty about the way she treats you, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about limiting your time with him. You are 16, you aren\u2019t expected to act like the bigger person here.", "And I remember being 16 and I never did anything wrong either.\n\nI'm just saying your dad's house seems like an incredibly unstable situation and adding to it doesn't help. You're NTA but you didn't get anything out of the situation.", "There are a lot of issues going on here that I don't even want to remotely try to unravel.\n\nHer friend has never been to her house. It doesn't appear she asked permission for the friend to stay. She doesn't have any reason to wake up other than her friend having to pee. Etc.\n\nI'm not defending the SM at all, hence my NTA. \n\nBut this isn't a stable situation, and I don't think using the potty is what is the problem here.", "please look at my recent comments I replied to somebody asking something similar About getting out the situation.", "Cool. I'm saying adding fire to fire doesn't put out fire.", "but the fact is, I\u2019m not adding fire? regardless of what my stepmother does I still would love my father and would want to spend time with him regardless of where he\u2019s at. If she decides she wants to butt heads with me every time she sees me that\u2019s on her.", "Good luck out there."]}
