How does living off your mom and keeping your head down while working for peanuts equal a strategy for becoming more secure?\n\nLook, it sounds like your mom has her head up her ass, and maybe she didn't do a great job of parenting you so that you developed into a successfully independent adult.

You're the one who made the assumption that she was paying her way and not paying what she can, and now you're going to call OP TA because of YOUR misunderstanding of the situation and the assumption that she was taking care of herself.\n\nYes, it's a very ideal option to tell her to just leave her mother's house, get trained, have a better job, and do all of that while on a minimum wage job that you're both chiding her for having at this point in her life and also insisting is enough to save to make those moves. \n\nWhat if she was ready to get a job and move out when she was 18 and mom said she needed her to stay?

Make sure you have your important documents on you at all times and a bank account that your mother knows nothing about at a bank where she doesn't do business.", "Oof, your mom is going to get scammed... Had she met him in person prior to moving him in??", "I think he's very weird, honestly. He's already furnishing the house to his liking after less than a week of being here, blasts music 12 hours a day, and gets very obsessive about thinks like keeping the toilet seat up (yes, really) and things being done his way, when he wants them done.", "With what money? He's unemployed.\n\nCheck your credit reports and lock your credit.", "With your mother\u2019s money?  I hope she didn\u2019t add him to the deed.", "She claims to have done so, and that she's done her due diligence all the way around, and I'd take her word for it if she wasn't behaving irrationally on every other front.", "This is very concerning behavior.  I hope you can fix your door, keep yourself safe, and get out ASAP.  Also, I hope you can talk to your brother because your mother is likely to end up scammed, homeless, penniless, and crying to him/you to take her in.  Good luck, OP. Yikes.", "Yes, with her money. \n\nShe just sees a big strong man doing what he can to help us poor unworthy women.", "Me too", "Ask your brother if he can help you get settled someplace away from your mom. Even if she does kick this guy out, nothing about your relationship with her sounds healthy.", "They can be very convincing\u2026 I hope your mom is ok! I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in that situation.", "I would seriously do a background check.", "Oh, fuck that forever.

Do you know any of her coworkers? Would they be willing to do a background check on this guy?", "Get this--- this woman who works in law enforcement claims that anybody who truly cares about her wouldn't do such a thing.\n\nShe won't even share his last name.", "I realize that practically/ emotionally it's not quite that simple but -- you're a legal adult who pays rent. She really can't \"forbid\" you to lock your door. \n\nAlso when it comes down to it, you're two adults in a roommate situation. There's no \"disrespectful\" at all. \n\nTell her you want a lock on your door, otherwise she can either kick out the guy or you can move out. Her choice. (Chances are she'll choose the lock.) \n\nNTA. (But seriously, *can* you move out? You should really consider moving out.)", "That's horrible and very dangerous. Is there anyone else you can stay with? I'm legit scared for you", "Just move out for your own piece of mind .Find a place and let her know one day before the moving.", "\"she also starts ripping her hair out if I mention moving out.\"\n\nPlease leave that house.", "Working on it. I'm about to get a longevity raise at work and I'm hoping that'll put me in a spot where I can afford an apartment close by, even if I'd need a roommate.", "Working on it. I'll get a longevity raise from my job soon so maybe I can afford my own apartment or at least find a roommate.", "I mean... not literally, of course. Just a massive pity party and doing everything she can to convince me I'm not prepared for the real world.", "Tell her she needs a background check or you're going to protect yourself. If she tries that stuff again don't let her manipulate you. Tell her her happiness is important to her and your health and safety is important to you. End of discussion"]}
