I snapped and told her to go to her room and that she can\u2019t speak to people like that! And I told her to spend the day cleaning her room, she\u2019s been at it since school finished 4 weeks ago and it\u2019s still not done.\n\nAnyway I turned her screentime off and she messaged me asking why it was off and that she need Spotify and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t hard\u201d I told her that after her carry on this morning did she really need to ask. She said \u201cI hate you\u201d I said fine and that maybe moving forward she should get some control of her temper and her behaviour. She said \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll start to understand your kids better one day when you stop turning all your problems about 22year old son and I\u201d I told her to put her tech in my room and that she was done. She said \u201cThe truth hurts doesn\u2019t it\u201d.\n\nThat was the last thing spoken. I have let her float through the house for food and showers and stuff but she\u2019s spent all her time in her room and I haven\u2019t acknowledged her at all.\n\nNow and I guess this is probably the sticking point for me. This is exactly what her father did when we\u2019d argue. We\u2019ve been separated for about 4 years now. He never apologized, never even tried to talk about the issue, just waited a couple hours to a day and then just started to act like everything was ok. Zero accountability, zero responsibility for the past behaviours and zero remorse. We could go for a week without speaking before I would bail him up and sort it out!\n\nHer reaction these past few days have really taken me back to when I was married to her father and has really bothered me. There was DV involved.\n\nSo now it\u2019s Thursday night, the 22nd of December. She is showing absolutely no signs of acknowledging her wrongdoing and I am absolutely adamant that I am not backing down this time! \n\nSo the question is, if she hasn\u2019t apologized by Christmas Day AITA if I don\u2019t put her presents under the tree and if I don\u2019t give them to her?\n\n**Edit**\n\nOk, bit of hostility here.\n\nWe went to counseling after me and the kids left, she's fine, the counselor actually said we had a great relationship, which we normally do.\n\nThe issue here is her attitude. She's very self-entitled.\nFeels like the world owes her a favour. And while yes she is a typical teenager and yes this is typical teenager behaviour, I am just fed up with her attitude.\n\nI am recovering from a broken neck and she says \"So I guess it's all about you now\"\n\nAnd what has surprised me most about the comments here is just how much value and importance has been put on the gifts, the material stuff.\n\nI tell both my kids everyday that I love them and how much they mean to me. And everytime my daughter lashes out I'm the first to go to her to fix the issue. I thought trying something different might stop the rat wheel situation.\n\nAs for my son, he has aspergers.

IF AT ANY POINT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO SNAP AND YELL, THREATEN, OR OTHERWISE SHOW AGRESSION, YOU WILL RETREAT IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ACTING ON THOSE IMPULSES, AND GIVE YOURSELF SOME SPACE TO COOL OFF.\n3. you are going to initiate a conversation on her turf. do it privately where no siblings or others can escalate anything, maybe even do it in her room so she feels safe. \n4. share the thoughts and feelings that you decided were going to be constructive. if there are a lot, only share some at first so youre not dominating the conversation. \n5. listen to her thoughts and feelings. she will probably have feelings that she blames you for. you may not feel they are your fault. she may be angry with you for reason you dont agree with. you dont have to agree. you dont have to apologize for your actions. DO show her compassion. acknowledge that her feelings must be intense and difficult to deal with no matter what caused them. she is upset. it is hard. she is a kid and that means her emotions are more volatile, but she still feels them. they probably hurt. be her mother and tell her youre sorry shes upset and you know it must be hard to control her behavior when she's feeling so much. validate that it is hard to clean her room and do her chores, and that it is frustrating when her brother takes her spot. \n6. tell her you forgive her. this doesnt mean revoking her punishments. consequences help you learn to control your impulsive actions. feeling shame over an emotional outburst that is actually super normal for her age will only make it worse. so will feeling like you hate her or are mad at her or think there's something wrong with her. apologizing is very hard when youre scared that someone will rub it in and when you are feeling intense shame it can be hard to admit that you made a mistake as that means the shame is right. shes 14. to her, the present moment is also the past and future. if she feels like she is bad now, she is sure she'll never get better. \n7. if you feel like you need to for your own sake, once you have allowed her to feel seen and heard, you might share the way that she hurt you, accepting that she may not agree, but acknowledging how feeling those emotions hurt no matter what caused them. she might not be mature about it. remember that you are the literal physical bigger person. \n\nif you do all this and are able to keep your cool, this could go two ways. remember that she has not prepared for this conversation like you have. at any point here she might start screaming and fighting you again. if that happens, you need to step back before your emotions start to escalate too, give yourself some space and compassion, because teenagers are the worst, and try again from the beginning once youre back to a calm state. \n\nshe also might respond positively on the first try. she doesnt have to apologize, just like you didnt have to apologize, she just has to be calm and not lose control of her temper, and listen to what you're saying, even if she doesnt agree. the purpose of this conversation is not for one of you to accept fault, it is for you to show her that you still love her, and for both of you to make your own personal peace with the agument. you can decide together if you would like to forget about it now that you have talked, revisit later, maybe just cuddle and cry all day, but once youre done, and you finish that conversation, you have to let it go. no additional punishments, let her consequences from before finish up but dont add to them. \n\nalso, *please* remember that your immature child is not the same as your immature ex husband. he was an adult who never grew out of being an butthole teenager, she is a teenager who will grow out of being a butthole teenager once shes not a teenager anymore. she will be okay. this will pass. it will pass faster if you are gentle and compassionate as you guide her through it.", "YTA she's still a child.

Think how would you or some of your friends would react at a similar age.  \n\n\nAs a parent, your actions often have a significant impact on the development of your child's behavior. It is important to be mindful of the way you interact with and respond to your child, as these interactions can shape their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. By modeling positive behaviors and setting clear boundaries and expectations, you can help your child learn how to manage their emotions, communicate effectively, and make good decisions.", "Yta. Narcissism incoming.", "NAH to me personally.\n\nI read a misbehaving kid and a parent trying to punish them butting heads. Seems pretty normal.\n\nI wouldn't ruin her Christmas though, even if you think it's rewarding poor behaviour.\n\nMaybe have a talk with her about how serious you are about her doing chores and not yelling at people for stupid things like someone sitting in their chair. She shouldn't have a \"chair\" in the first place, that's a trait I would as a parent want to weed out of my children because they turn into obnoxious adults.\n\nMy mom would've flipped on me if I called a piece of her furniture \"mine\" especially in an attempt to kick someone already occupying it out. That's just shitty behaviour.\n\nYou also need to remember teenagers are hormonal as fuck, and that sometimes they can't control their emotions because a gland in their body is literally secreting too much, They cannot control that.\n\nYou can control poor behaviour though, I never would've thought of a chair in the kitchen as \"mine\" as a teenager, I learnt what sharing was. People need to learn that communal things are not theirs and to not be territorial about them, regardless of age, I think you learn that crap in kindergarten.  \n\n\nI told my mom i hated her a couple times when we had fights as a teenager though, and I genuinely thought she was wrong about whatever we were fighting about, when I look back on it now, I know she was right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I snapped and told her to go to her room and that she can\u2019t speak to people like that! And I told her to spend the day cleaning her room, she\u2019s been at it since school finished 4 weeks ago and it\u2019s still not done.\n\nAnyway I turned her screentime off and she messaged me asking why it was off and that she need Spotify and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t hard\u201d I told her that after her carry on this morning did she really need to ask. She said \u201cI hate you\u201d I said fine and that maybe moving forward she should get some control of her temper and her behaviour. She said \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll start to understand your kids better one day when you stop turning all your problems about 22year old son and I\u201d I told her to put her tech in my room and that she was done. She said \u201cThe truth hurts doesn\u2019t it\u201d.\n\nThat was the last thing spoken. I have let her float through the house for food and showers and stuff but she\u2019s spent all her time in her room and I haven\u2019t acknowledged her at all.\n\nNow and I guess this is probably the sticking point for me. This is exactly what her father did when we\u2019d argue. We\u2019ve been separated for about 4 years now. He never apologized, never even tried to talk about the issue, just waited a couple hours to a day and then just started to act like everything was ok. Zero accountability, zero responsibility for the past behaviours and zero remorse. We could go for a week without speaking before I would bail him up and sort it out!\n\nHer reaction these past few days have really taken me back to when I was married to her father and has really bothered me. There was DV involved.\n\nSo now it\u2019s Thursday night, the 22nd of December. She is showing absolutely no signs of acknowledging her wrongdoing and I am absolutely adamant that I am not backing down this time! \n\nSo the question is, if she hasn\u2019t apologized by Christmas Day AITA if I don\u2019t put her presents under the tree and if I don\u2019t give them to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The phone wouldn't connect and her GPS said she was still at the school when she wasn't. She's grounded from all electronics, her hover board, her quad, she lost her allowance, lost her pick night (once a week she gets to pick dinner)..... BUT i say down and talked with her about it. She wasn't malicious just absent minded. She still gets Christmas and we still sat down to watch Christmas movies together.", "I have raised 4 children. I absolutely understand the difference between normal teenager moodiness and having an abusive child. LIke I said in my original reply, I don't know her story, but I do know mine, which is exactly why I told her she needs to get ahead of it NOW before it spirals. If her daughter is on the edge, which it sounds like she is, and it also sounds like mom is, they need to get help NOW. \n\nAnd why should her brother not sit if his chores are completed? She was asked to unload the dishwasher, which is her chore, not her brother's, and she lost her shit. Sure, moody teens may grumble and be kinda of a jerk about it but to choose to go full nuclear over it is something beyond normal teen behavior. They need help. That's all I said. \n\nStop looking for a fight on the internet."]}
