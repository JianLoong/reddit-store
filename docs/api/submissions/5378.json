I snapped and told her to go to her room and that she can\u2019t speak to people like that! And I told her to spend the day cleaning her room, she\u2019s been at it since school finished 4 weeks ago and it\u2019s still not done.\n\nAnyway I turned her screentime off and she messaged me asking why it was off and that she need Spotify and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t hard\u201d I told her that after her carry on this morning did she really need to ask. She said \u201cI hate you\u201d I said fine and that maybe moving forward she should get some control of her temper and her behaviour. She said \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll start to understand your kids better one day when you stop turning all your problems about 22year old son and I\u201d I told her to put her tech in my room and that she was done. She said \u201cThe truth hurts doesn\u2019t it\u201d.\n\nThat was the last thing spoken. I have let her float through the house for food and showers and stuff but she\u2019s spent all her time in her room and I haven\u2019t acknowledged her at all.\n\nNow and I guess this is probably the sticking point for me. This is exactly what her father did when we\u2019d argue. We\u2019ve been separated for about 4 years now. He never apologized, never even tried to talk about the issue, just waited a couple hours to a day and then just started to act like everything was ok. Zero accountability, zero responsibility for the past behaviours and zero remorse. We could go for a week without speaking before I would bail him up and sort it out!\n\nHer reaction these past few days have really taken me back to when I was married to her father and has really bothered me. There was DV involved.\n\nSo now it\u2019s Thursday night, the 22nd of December. She is showing absolutely no signs of acknowledging her wrongdoing and I am absolutely adamant that I am not backing down this time! \n\nSo the question is, if she hasn\u2019t apologized by Christmas Day AITA if I don\u2019t put her presents under the tree and if I don\u2019t give them to her?\n\n**Edit**\n\nOk, bit of hostility here.\n\nWe went to counseling after me and the kids left, she's fine, the counselor actually said we had a great relationship, which we normally do.\n\nThe issue here is her attitude. She's very self-entitled.\nFeels like the world owes her a favour. And while yes she is a typical teenager and yes this is typical teenager behaviour, I am just fed up with her attitude.\n\nI am recovering from a broken neck and she says \"So I guess it's all about you now\"\n\nAnd what has surprised me most about the comments here is just how much value and importance has been put on the gifts, the material stuff.\n\nI tell both my kids everyday that I love them and how much they mean to me. And everytime my daughter lashes out I'm the first to go to her to fix the issue. I thought trying something different might stop the rat wheel situation.\n\nAs for my son, he has aspergers.

Abusive relationships have a power imbalance tilted in the abusers favor. In this situation, you have the power over the 14 year old and the week before Xmas you've decided to confine her to her room because she was upset about the dishes and her brother getting to relax while she does chores? When my sister in law was 15 she cried her eyes out and got mad because she wanted pancakes but we didn't have flour. Kids that age are dealing with hormones and puberty.\n\nAlso why are you expecting her to apologize when you haven't had a calm conversation about what happened???? YOU are the adult and YOU need to make sure she is okay and create a space for you both to talk about what happened. Your trauma response is NOT her responsibility.

Therapy is very much needed.  Your daughter\u2019s behavior is exactly what you get when both parents fail at communicating effectively and handling arguments maturely.  You created the beastly behavior you\u2019re now throwing a childish silent-treatment tantrum over.\n\nNot giving her her gifts will be signaling rejection and not loving her.  Even more bad conflict behavior.\n\nAs annoying as her behavior is, I feel sorry for her - she\u2019s behaving the way her parents taught her and doesn\u2019t know better, and now she\u2019s being punished for her parents\u2019 inability to do better and teach her better.", "YTA for letting this escalate.

TEACH HER TO BE BETTER. \n\ni dont really think youre an asshole *yet,* but you need to remember that she's 14. you are going to have to be the bigger person here because you are *literally physically* the bigger person. here is what you are going to do step by step. \n\n1. youre going to inspect your thoughts and feelings about the whole situation, and decide which ones it would be constructive for you to share. *not which ones will make you feel better.* the ones that are going to help both of you make peace. \n2. youre going to get yourself into a place where you feel like you are in really good control of your emotions. your daughter will probably be defensive, and she will probably scream and yell. you are an adult. you will not raise your voice, threaten her with punishments, or intimidate her in any other way. you will model the appropriate behavior and respond to her with empathy EVEN IF you dong feel it. IF AT ANY POINT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO SNAP AND YELL, THREATEN, OR OTHERWISE SHOW AGRESSION, YOU WILL RETREAT IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ACTING ON THOSE IMPULSES, AND GIVE YOURSELF SOME SPACE TO COOL OFF.\n3. you are going to initiate a conversation on her turf. do it privately where no siblings or others can escalate anything, maybe even do it in her room so she feels safe. \n4. share the thoughts and feelings that you decided were going to be constructive. if there are a lot, only share some at first so youre not dominating the conversation. \n5. listen to her thoughts and feelings. she will probably have feelings that she blames you for. you may not feel they are your fault. she may be angry with you for reason you dont agree with. you dont have to agree. you dont have to apologize for your actions. DO show her compassion. acknowledge that her feelings must be intense and difficult to deal with no matter what caused them. she is upset. it is hard. she is a kid and that means her emotions are more volatile, but she still feels them. they probably hurt. be her mother and tell her youre sorry shes upset and you know it must be hard to control her behavior when she's feeling so much. validate that it is hard to clean her room and do her chores, and that it is frustrating when her brother takes her spot. \n6. tell her you forgive her. this doesnt mean revoking her punishments. consequences help you learn to control your impulsive actions. feeling shame over an emotional outburst that is actually super normal for her age will only make it worse. so will feeling like you hate her or are mad at her or think there's something wrong with her. apologizing is very hard when youre scared that someone will rub it in and when you are feeling intense shame it can be hard to admit that you made a mistake as that means the shame is right. shes 14. to her, the present moment is also the past and future. if she feels like she is bad now, she is sure she'll never get better. \n7. if you feel like you need to for your own sake, once you have allowed her to feel seen and heard, you might share the way that she hurt you, accepting that she may not agree, but acknowledging how feeling those emotions hurt no matter what caused them. she might not be mature about it. remember that you are the literal physical bigger person. \n\nif you do all this and are able to keep your cool, this could go two ways. remember that she has not prepared for this conversation like you have. at any point here she might start screaming and fighting you again. if that happens, you need to step back before your emotions start to escalate too, give yourself some space and compassion, because teenagers are the worst, and try again from the beginning once youre back to a calm state. \n\nshe also might respond positively on the first try. she doesnt have to apologize, just like you didnt have to apologize, she just has to be calm and not lose control of her temper, and listen to what you're saying, even if she doesnt agree. the purpose of this conversation is not for one of you to accept fault, it is for you to show her that you still love her, and for both of you to make your own personal peace with the agument. you can decide together if you would like to forget about it now that you have talked, revisit later, maybe just cuddle and cry all day, but once youre done, and you finish that conversation, you have to let it go. no additional punishments, let her consequences from before finish up but dont add to them. \n\nalso, *please* remember that your immature child is not the same as your immature ex husband. he was an adult who never grew out of being an butthole teenager, she is a teenager who will grow out of being a butthole teenager once shes not a teenager anymore. she will be okay. this will pass. it will pass faster if you are gentle and compassionate as you guide her through it.", "YTA she's still a child.

Gifts are typically given as a gesture of love and appreciation, and withholding them can damage the relationship and create resentment.\r  \n\r  \nIt is important to address the underlying issues that led to the argument and to work towards finding a resolution. This may involve having a calm, open, and honest conversation with your daughter, setting clear boundaries and expectations, and working together to find ways to improve communication and resolve conflicts. You may also want to consider seeking the help of a family therapist or counselor to support you in addressing these issues and building a stronger, healthier relationship with your daughter.  \n\n\nRemember that everything you might do she will remember and might think about in 5 - 10 -15 years.  Think how would you or some of your friends would react at a similar age.  \n\n\nAs a parent, your actions often have a significant impact on the development of your child's behavior. It is important to be mindful of the way you interact with and respond to your child, as these interactions can shape their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. By modeling positive behaviors and setting clear boundaries and expectations, you can help your child learn how to manage their emotions, communicate effectively, and make good decisions.", "Yta.

She shouldn't have a \"chair\" in the first place, that's a trait I would as a parent want to weed out of my children because they turn into obnoxious adults.\n\nMy mom would've flipped on me if I called a piece of her furniture \"mine\" especially in an attempt to kick someone already occupying it out. That's just shitty behaviour.\n\nYou also need to remember teenagers are hormonal as fuck, and that sometimes they can't control their emotions because a gland in their body is literally secreting too much, They cannot control that.\n\nYou can control poor behaviour though, I never would've thought of a chair in the kitchen as \"mine\" as a teenager, I learnt what sharing was.

I snapped and told her to go to her room and that she can\u2019t speak to people like that! And I told her to spend the day cleaning her room, she\u2019s been at it since school finished 4 weeks ago and it\u2019s still not done.\n\nAnyway I turned her screentime off and she messaged me asking why it was off and that she need Spotify and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t hard\u201d I told her that after her carry on this morning did she really need to ask. She said \u201cI hate you\u201d I said fine and that maybe moving forward she should get some control of her temper and her behaviour. She said \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll start to understand your kids better one day when you stop turning all your problems about 22year old son and I\u201d I told her to put her tech in my room and that she was done. She said \u201cThe truth hurts doesn\u2019t it\u201d.\n\nThat was the last thing spoken. I have let her float through the house for food and showers and stuff but she\u2019s spent all her time in her room and I haven\u2019t acknowledged her at all.\n\nNow and I guess this is probably the sticking point for me. This is exactly what her father did when we\u2019d argue. We\u2019ve been separated for about 4 years now. He never apologized, never even tried to talk about the issue, just waited a couple hours to a day and then just started to act like everything was ok. Zero accountability, zero responsibility for the past behaviours and zero remorse. We could go for a week without speaking before I would bail him up and sort it out!\n\nHer reaction these past few days have really taken me back to when I was married to her father and has really bothered me. There was DV involved.\n\nSo now it\u2019s Thursday night, the 22nd of December. She is showing absolutely no signs of acknowledging her wrongdoing and I am absolutely adamant that I am not backing down this time! \n\nSo the question is, if she hasn\u2019t apologized by Christmas Day AITA if I don\u2019t put her presents under the tree and if I don\u2019t give them to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Instead of the silent treatment or withdrawal of affection, get to the bottom of it.", "ESH. I don't mean this in a mean way but you both need more therapy and you need to stop doing the silent treatment (literally emotional and psychological abuse).

Cancelling Christmas will not teach her a thing and will only add to her anger towards you.", "Everything you\u2019ve written here shows your own self entitlement and shitty parenting. You\u2019re the adult and she\u2019s a teenager. They\u2019re going to have outbursts, your job is to not have one back. Furthermore, literally punishing her for the sins of her father is gross. YTA.

You need to stop comparing her to your ex, she needs to tell you why she is so upset. Right now you are in a downward spiral of her acting out, you overreacting, her acting out more, etc. Just stop. Talk to your child. She is not the enemy. If you continue like this then all your kid will remember about this year is how you cancelled her Christmas because she didn\u2019t empty the dishwasher. It\u2019s a bit much.", "YTA- and a massive B! Who\u2019s the adult here exactly?? Because you sound like your teenager! Be an adult and get over it. Silent treatment is extremely childish.", "YTA you don\u2019t t like silent treatment but you aren\u2019t modeling better behavior. At her age she needs to see, in real time, How to behave from you. What you are doing is so much more important than what you are saying. \n\nOffer an olive branch offer to listen to her and do NOT try to lecture, correct or minimize how she feels. Let her vent and thank her for talking to you. Process what she\u2019s told you and think about why she feels that way, is it categorically untrue, does she have a point or can you at least see why she\u2019d feel that way?\n\nModel the correct way to behave. Talk to her, if you were wrong say so and work to fix things on your end. If I react poorly to something my kids did I let them know that what they did wasn\u2019t okay but neither was my reaction. Two things can be true. I\u2019m sure you were the one teenager who never had moody reactions to your parents so you might not be able to relate to her but right now her body is changing , her family has changed and now this. Shits rough at 14. Your daughter needs to know you love her even when she\u2019s being the biggest asshole on the planet. Setting boundaries is vastly different than silent treatment. \n\ncheck back in with your therapist or arrange for your kid to go alone so she can vent.", "I'm so sorry - teenagers can be the worst. \n\nI wouldn't give her anything. I'd leave her to be in her room (without any screens or anything to do but clean) and let her stew.\n\nThis is how you break her entitled attitude. NTA - stick to your guns!

She\u2019s just a kid, it sounds like you have absolutely no respect or parenting skills for teens if this is how you are going. PLEASE do not punish her by not doing Christmas, it\u2019ll make her resent you more. 14 is when girls need the love & support from their mums, the more you push her away the worst her teen years will be - trust me.", "YTA and I suggest you maybe look into counseling again. You\u2019ve compared your daughter to your abusive ex, this is not healthy. \n\nYou do not go \u201csilent treatment\u201d on you daughter. You\u2019ve pulled her electronics - devastating for a teen. Now you need to sit down and speak with her. Ask her why she\u2019s screaming in the house and at her brother (and yes, she may be resentful about the Asperger situation). If she is willing to talk, listen. You can express how you feel about her behavior (lack of respect, why does she feel others should do chores and not her). DO NOT COMPARE HER TO YOUR EX. Deal with her individually and also how you feel. Be sure to emphasize that you love her. \n\nThere may be more going on with her than you realize. If you are fortunate enough for her to share what it is remember it is how she feels (and yes sometimes the term angst may seem petty and not important to you, it is a big thing to her).\n\nDon\u2019t hold her Christmas gifts hostage, you bought them, presumably, in love and regardless of the teenage hysterics, you still love her. \n\nYTA good luck.", ">And everytime my daughter lashes out I'm the first to go to her to fix the issue.

He didn't address the situation either. If your daughter is anywhere near as stubborn as I am, TRUST ME! this will not get better.

You are the parent - you are never going to help her learn how to be responsible and respectful (the primary issues you seem to complain about) when you seem to be modelling irresponsible and non-respectful behavior directly at her.  \n\nIf we had to ask your daughter, I'm guessing she would say that your refusal to \"back down this time\" and admitting no wrongdoing also reminds ***her*** that this is also exactly what her father did.  And I'm also guessing your daughter has some lingering issues there, given what you described (I'm sorry for what you went through).  Do your best to break this cycle, and not let it continue through your own behavior.", "Gentle YTA Im going to say this really gently. A childs primary caregiver withdrawing affection and attention is classed as abuse and it would score an ACE (adverse childhood experience) trauma point.

Society is in trouble LMAO.", "YTA", "Yta, I agree with what everyone has said. I just wanted to add, you would be a giant AH if you didn't give her her Christmas presents.

Can you see how you are now perpetrating the abuse (in your edit) on your daughter? \n\nShe is a young teen. She comes from a family where she witnessed DV. And yes, even if she was very young, it effects her. A lot of her behavior is typical teen behavior. Some of it is acting out because you are not understanding her or showing her empathy. At least that\u2019s how she feels bc she literally told you so. Instead of trying to understand her, you take it personally (again) and up your punishment. Some of it was also really passive aggressive. Now you aren\u2019t talking to her bc you think she owes you an apology?\n\nYou\u2019re the adult and the one with a lot of power in this situation. You are just as (if not more) responsible for this situation than she is. And now no Christmas presents?\n\nIf you\u2019re not already in therapy please consider it. This post screams of unresolved issues on your part\u2026if you do so maybe your daughter will be willing to as well.", "Yes, YTA", "NTA. Good kids get presents, bad kids get coal. Besides, the world is full of over dramatic assholes. We don't need anymore", "YTA. You need to work out your issues within yourself and with her. Withholding presents and giving her the silent treatment is passive aggressive bs. You are the adult here. Step up to the task. What you describe is pretty typical teen moody behavior. That doesn't make it okay, but it's certainly not DV even though you are feeling reactive about it due to your own trauma.", "YTA, and I\u2019m saying this after your edit. I have a strong feeling you favor your son and deep down you know it. Be an adult and talk to your child, have a long conversation where she is allowed to express her feeling with you, however I have a feeling that she feels she can\u2019t do this. That would explain why she lashes out, her negative feeling could be building until they boil over. \n\nYou are the adult so start acting like it and work on your own immature reactions. \n\nAlso nice try with your \u2018how much value and importance has been put on gifts\u2019..

I am so sick of seeing parents ask if they should take their children\u2019s Christmas presents away on here. GETTING CHRISTMAS GIFTS SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON A CHILD\u2019S BEHAVIOR! If they\u2019ve done something wrong, deal with that separately from Christmas. Also, a parent giving their child the silent treatment is just horrible. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER GIFTS AWAY. This will not be a lesson to her, it will only create resentment towards you. She will never forget the Christmas that her mother took her presents away.", "You need to keep going to therapy. All of you. Talk to your daughter. Communicate.", "YTA, you\u2019re distancing yourself emotionally as a punishment. It\u2019s completely reasonable to remove privileges until a task is completed, but you can\u2019t remove love.", "YTA. Look, 14 year olds are assholes all the time.

She didn't compare her to the abuse, just they way she learned to respond to disagreements. You are ridiculous. How is she to have a rational conversation with someone who insists on screeching vitrol every time she opens her mouth? Go away. I am so sick of the entitlement from kids like OP's daughter and posters like you who feel that any form of discipline for bad behavior ( remember the part where she SCREAMED AT HER BROTHER FOR NO REASON AND REFUSED TO DO HER CHORES) is abuse. It isn't!", "It's crazy to me how materialistic so many people are. How many think behavior doesn't matter just give them presents because they're minors. Society is in trouble. It seems as though 90% of it is raising self entitled brats with no accountability or responsibility that keep their hand out.", "This is such a great response. Kids learn how to handle conflict from watching their parents, so where does OP think her daughter learned how to behave? My parents were never great at handling disagreements (silent treatment or screaming/name-calling) and I didn't learn how to properly work through conflict with a partner until my late 20s. They've really done her a disservice here.", "This so much. OP snapped and blew the original argument completely out of proportion.", "During the whole argument OP described she sounded like a teen throwing a tantrum herself. \n\nI mean OP escalated the original argument.\n\nSo, she is giving the daugter the silent treatment since Tuesday, took away her electronics and seems to favor the son. Sure let's ruin Christmas too. \n\nDoesn't really sound like she likes her child.", "Yeah, hard to see how the kid became unable to express her feelings in a mature way when the mom is giving her child the silent treatment. \n\nIf your kid is \"uncontrollable\" at this point it's because you've already parented them horribly and did not provide them the tools they needed to know how to manage themselves. Now is not the time to double down on the bad parenting, it's time to go to therapy and learn how to provide those tools you failed to give them in the first place.", "Oh quit with the BS. Silent treatment isn't abuse. If you're ok with your child acting like this and being told they hate you that's fine but no has to tolerate that kind of behavior.", "You sound like you absolutely resent your daughter, and she most likely feels that. \n\nYou were the one who originally escalated the first argument, and you haven't talked to her for 2-3 days. It's almost like you are a teen yourself.\n\nNothing about this shows you actually communicating with your daughter.", "Oh my gosh, totally agree. Even as a small child if I argued with my parents, one of them (usually my dad) would come to my room after we\u2019d had some time to calm down and apologize. Even if I was being a total brat he would come to me and say he was sorry for getting mad or whatever, and ask if I was ready to talk about it. I had issues managing my emotions and the way he taught me that it\u2019s okay to be wrong and to say your sorry, to not be prideful, and that it\u2019s better to be happy than to be right, made such an impact on my adult relationships with friends and partners. Not to mention my parents have always been people I knew i could trust to hear me, to tell the truth to, and I always knew I was loved even when we disagreed.", "Again...do some research. You don't have to be super lovey-dovey all the time, but not talking to your ***child*** suggests the relationship is conditional. In this case, it's with a child who is going through the difficult process of growing up, with all the hormones and messiness that entails.\n\nThe silent treatment is unacceptable and bad parenting.", "Absolutely, this! The daughter was originally being punished for screaming at her brother for no damn reason. THEN she copped attitude for not doing her chores. THEN she told her mother she hates her and the truth hurts. It seems every one here who is claiming y t a is of the same entitled generation as OP's daughter. For the record, as a child, the ONLY thing you are entitled to is being loved by your parents, having a roof over your head, and food on the table. Internet, phones, toys, tv's, etc are PRIVILEGES that are earned through chores and behavior. It is NOT abuse to take them away as correction for misbehavior and deeds. And not speaking to your child, just as they aren't speaking to you, is not abuse. Get over yourselves.

It's being the rational, loving, firm, consistent and accessible adult who teaches their children what's acceptable and what's not. \n\nIf you're resorting to abuse--and again, it is widely understood by psychologists that the silent treatment is abuse--you need to ask yourself some tough questions and get some help.", "lol your CHILD you forced into this world owes you nothing, you owe them unconditional compassion and understanding and patience.
