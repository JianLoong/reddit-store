Thank God my husband stepped in and kicked them both out of our house, even tho it did end up with a really big argument between my fiance and his brother.

Their are reasons why most schools try to make sure twins are seperated into different classes, especially at the elementary level, and why seperate interest are usually encouraged by the parents.

I dont see a lot of brides so adamant about someone else wearing their wedding dress where its not like a daughter or somthing. Thats the strangest part for me. I hope that things get settled and hopefully the BIL talks to someone professionally before any damage is done to the relationship. Their grown men, they dont have to do things a certain way because of the, \"were special, were twins\" thing. He (hopefully still) has a good relationship with his brother. Now do the good brother thing and be their for him on HIS special day. \n\nWho wants to hear a fun fact i remember hearing on Manswers like over a decade ago?

Give them the task of minders to those two the entire night - pretend to be friends, and stick to them like glue.
