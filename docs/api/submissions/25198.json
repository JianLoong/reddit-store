His brother got eloped to his wife (27F) and even suggested to my fiance to do the same on the same day as him, but of course he shut that down quickly as we both agreed on having a wedding already.

Thank God my husband stepped in and kicked them both out of our house, even tho it did end up with a really big argument between my fiance and his brother.

Congratulations, by the way!", "So this is the weirdest story I read on Reddit today.\n\nAny sane person would have shut their partner down for even caring about what you wore. ---So they are pretty much both nuts.", "If they are crossing over the line then hard stop no to all their requests.

Tell you fianc\u00e9 to tell his brother to seek therapy. This is extremely odd behavior. Maybe tell him he can only attend the wedding if he gets help. I feel like if you uninvite them they still might do something to sabotage it. At least BIL idk if his wife is equally unhinged but if you do take that route I\u2019d suggest making sure your venue has security.", "I\u2019m really hoping he\u2019s not planning on sharing wives because that sounds like where his sharing and intertwining is headed.", "My guess is SIL is regretting eloping and trying to horn in on their wedding", "NTA\u2014Yikes!

Good luck, OP!", "Twin maybe feels he cheated himself and his wife out of something special by eloping and would like a second bite of the cherry at ops expense.

What she is doing and has been doing cant be good for your fiance's mental health. \n\nI feel when the argument happens about inviting bil your fiance needs to be firm with his mother and let her know that them doing everything together was cute when they were kids but its not anymore. That your fiance is his own person not just a twin and they dont have to do everything exactly the same and if that is her stance then she is going to miss out on a lot because hes done with her not listening to him. So either respect how he fills and reign in twin brother and get him to chill or your going to miss out as well", "This is ***super*** weird behavior - honestly I'd cancel the wedding as far as his family knows and then have it with just your family and not his, or even reschedule and do it elsewhere later without them, because what you don't want is a scene with crazy people at your wedding and that line telling you what's likely to happen has been crossed here, and if his mom knows she'll tell the crazy BIL.  NTA.", "Not to be rude because I get some cultures, but It's not her wedding so who is she to object to that? Would she go as far as not attending? If something happens who will be to blame?

Seems like if they want to have the same wedding experience, then they ought not come.", "So then why didn\u2019t he bother arranging something for *HIS* wedding vs trying to alter *yours*?  \n  \nThis is just bonkers. I\u2019m wondering why the SIL is so into it", "Why does he want their wedding experience to be the same? They aren\u2019t eight year olds getting matching haircuts, they\u2019re grown-ass adults getting married and starting their own respective lives and families. Does your BIL not know how to handle being a person and not part of a pair? This is absolutely bizarre behavior.", "Tell her you\u2019ll wear it and then just wear your own and keep hers until after the wedding so she can\u2019t wear it herself.", "Please tell me your future BIL is not going to want to share other things\u2026. Like spouses. I read way too many creepy books and articles but with the insistence on sharing that\u2019s first place my mind went.  If you have security at we do make sure security has a code word to identify SO from his brother so no confusion.\n\nMight explain to BIL & SIL IF  SIL wears her wedding gown to your wedding they will not be in any pictures.

She won\u2019t have it and you\u2019ll have your own perfect dress. This will also get your BIL off your backs because he will think you are doing what he wants and being twinsies. If they cause a scene when you walk down the aisle in your own dress, have security escort them out immediately. If his mom wants to leave with them, she can. Then have the most beautiful, memorable, individual wedding possible.", "You definitely need to assign watchers to both Sil and BiL. If she shows up in her wedding dress, then she gets escorted to the side. Maybe even buy a plain dress in her size that could be returned later if not needed. And someone needs to sit on BiL to keep him in line. I hope he's not the best man--it would be hard to avoid him being the best man, but there's waaaay too much leeway for him to cause chaos.", "Ask to try on the dress then set it on fire.", "One more reason to disinvite them!", "Hmm op could do a fake out. Wear the cheaper dress for photos before the wedding, have wine available let SIL ruin it. Kick their weirdo butts out and then wear the real dress rest of the day. \n\nNta op.

It\u2019s not cute for them to want matching wives.", "Definitely do this OP, i had read another reddit post a couple of months back where this happened to someone. Her sister was mad she was getting married first so she tried ruining ops wedding by changing things and she was able to do so cause their mother and op sounded similar on the phone and the mother agreed to help her older daughter and she started cancelling almost everything. Thankfully it didn't work but op mentioned that they had to then use passwords with everyone so nothing could get cancelled again.\n\nSo you guys should definitely do this.
