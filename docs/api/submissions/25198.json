His brother got eloped to his wife (27F) and even suggested to my fiance to do the same on the same day as him, but of course he shut that down quickly as we both agreed on having a wedding already.

Thank God my husband stepped in and kicked them both out of our house, even tho it did end up with a really big argument between my fiance and his brother.

This is important, especially since he is a twin. Your BIL's behavior is not healthy, and he could try to impersonate his brother and make changes to your wedding plans. I am sorry this is adding more stress to you and your fianc\u00e9's wedding planning. I wish you both the best.", "Tell her she's supposed to have it put away to pass down to her children someday, not to use it to try to relive her wedding day vicariously thru you.", "Maybe you should quietly elope then have a 2nd \u201cfirst\u201d ceremony incase she tries this crap. Or hire security to keep her from causing chaos. That\u2019s so weird, like twilight zone weird. If anything comment on how not good her dress is to wear twice.", "Or that they will try to ruin your dress and then offer to use her dress\u2026.", "It\u2019s your happy day and you should not invite anyone who you think will cause drama or try to upstage you. It\u2019s clear that BIL & SIL do not respect that this days is yours and not theirs and I highly encourage you to uninvite them as it is the only way to ensure nothing happens. If you choose to have them at the wedding be prepared to have it ruined and the bitterness that will follow.", "What do their parents think of this whole thing? This sounds so bizarre!!!", "This is all so strange. It\u2019s like being a twin is his entire personality but level 10000000.", "The bridesmaids need to be on watch duty making sure no unfortunate \"accidents\" happen to OP's dress, though. One should be posted outside the room they prepare in at all times. Or another good friend who's not part of the wedding party.", "Just kick both of the bil and sil out. Anybody who defends them gets kicked out too.", "Right?!? How\u2019s their relationship gonna be after OP\u2019s day is ruined and she is left feeling bitter and betrayed? OP needs to know that if things go south this will tear their family apart.  Parents, siblings and friends will be drawn into the battle and it will get ugly. Plus uninviting them might be the only way to set boundaries and let them know how creepy and unacceptable BIL\u2019s behavior is.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok and it\u2019s definitely crazy but I always just try to figure out people\u2019s motives.", "My fiance told me that whenever he brought it up to his parents how some of his brother's behavior makes him uncomfortable when they were teens they just told him that it's normal for twins to want to be close to each other and that he should be glad his brother loves him so much, so for them this is just normal \"twins behavior\".", "Ugh that\u2019s such a tough position to be in for you and your fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s not normal twin behavior to demand that your twins future wife wear the same thing your wife did at their wedding. It seems like possibly your fianc\u00e9 has always been the one wanting his own identity and independence and their parents have never helped him get there - it sounds like their parents were the ones who created that kind of dynamic, probably originally wanting them to be that close and never treated them as individuals. I don\u2019t have experience navigating that kind of thing as a twin, but that situation sounds really, really toxic. There isn\u2019t going to be an easy solution but it sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 are 100% on the same page so as long it stays that way, you\u2019ll make it through this! Always remember that a wedding is only one day and a marriage is the rest of your life - even if you end up inviting them and they make a scene, try to enjoy what you can and know that everyone else will think they\u2019re nuts. \n\nalso I would absolutely consider eloping so you know you will be able to have some kind of control over something and create a happy memory surrounding getting married. Weddings are stressful enough without a weird twin brother in law and his wife!!!", "I see a cross-country move in your future, because future BIL is unhinged. Imagine how the rest of your life is going too be, because this is the tip of the iceberg.", "You are not your SILs twin. There is absolutely no reason for two unrelated women to be forced to wear the same dress.", "That is not normal twin behavior. Studies show twins raised apart are more similar than those raised together because when raised together, they make choices to differentiate themselves. I felt like I had to claw out an identity of my own outside of being a twin, as did my twin. They may want to go to a therapist together so a professional can explain the issues here.", "I raised identical twin girls. One of them now has identical twin girls. This is so not normal. They couldn't have been or be closer but they were always encouraged to develop their own interests, own friends, own identities.\nThis is a parental failure. Some twin parents encourage such \"twinness\", they never learn to separate. It sounds like your fiances brother has completely intertwined his personality with him. This is not healthy. Hold your ground on this one.\n\nPS my twins were pregnant at the EXACT same time with their 3 year olds. Identical twins are not genetic so there is that. Identical is just a freak of nature. Fraternal is from the Mom. Good luck to you."]}
