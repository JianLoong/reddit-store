She made a list of how to make dinner each night (since my father is incompetent) and who should do what. Me and my sister (15 FtM&13F) usually have dinner chores unless dinner is easy, then only the parent makes dinner. \n\nFriday night is pizza night, and all my father had to do was put frozen pizzas in the oven, but he wanted us to do it instead. We refused, seeing as our mother specifically told him that he would be making dinner and we would only help if needed. He got incredibly angry and told us that he was the authority when mom is away, and no matter what she wrote, we should do what he says. \n\nMy sister had the foresight to record our argument, basically him shouting and changing the subject whenever I brought up that he was the adult and should therefore make dinner. He said that I was more familiar with how to use the oven, I told him that\u2019s weaponized incompetence, he called me pedantic and said I don\u2019t help out around the house enough. He said I was trying to cop out of responsibility, I told him he didn\u2019t participate socially enough in the family to know what our responsibilities were. \n\nWe have never gotten along and in all my years of living with him, he has yet to earn my respect because I see him as a man-child who expects everything to be done for him just because he\u2019s the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d of the family (my parents co-own a business, my mother is more accomplished than him, he ain\u2019t the breadwinner). \n\nShould I have just made the pizza and respected his authority as my father or was I in the right for standing up to him?", "created_utc": 1684600548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mzlr3/aita_for_not_cooking_the_pizza/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lol that's so funny...", "NTA. because clearly this is a way bigger issue a d you mention his weaponized incompetence.  You resent his lack of participation in the household and his authoritarian parenting.", "NTA sounds like your dad isn\u2019t used to being called out. This is clearly a build up and it isn\u2019t fair to you to take over your mom\u2019s responsibilities because he is lazy", "I\u2019ve been where you are. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating. I was 10, 11 and \u201cmaking dinner\u201d (put frozen food in the oven) while my able bodied parent did nothing.\n\nI get it. I hear you. Only you can decide if it\u2019s worth the argument. Sometimes it was for me and sometimes it wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d often wait until he heard someone in the kitchen and his famous line from the couch \u201cwhat are you making? Make me some.\u201d Some nights I wouldn\u2019t make anything, even for myself and he wouldn\u2019t eat. \n\nI\u2019m curious what your mom said about the recording though.", "NTA. Based on your comments, you have reached your emotional limit and your father took it one step further. You could have put the pizza in the oven and defused the situation, but my guess is that you were tired of seeing your father \u2018winning\u2019 and you \u2018losing\u2019.  So you rebelled. And your mother saw this coming, that\u2019s why she left instructions.  This is a very unhealthy family dynamic and way above a Reddit answer to address.  Perhaps when your mother returns you can sit down as a family and begin a calm discussion about the fight and everything that led up to it, including your feelings of being unloved and disrespected.", "ESH. Way too much drama over setting an oven and a timer. Jfc.", "NTA I totally understand what you mean. I made dinner for my dad since I was young because he realized I knew how to cook and since I am from a chauvinist country I had to do it, he was 40 and had me warming tortillas at age 10; I see how you could have many other issues and this triggered you and I see how he would want to skip that chore because he doesn\u2019t know how to do it or feels insecure on how to do it. I see why your mom left notes and understood that you are the kids and if she cares for you, your dad should be able to care you you too. \n\nSorry for my English but NTA.", "I think a little bit more background here might help. My father has never liked me because I only give people respect when I feel they\u2019ve earned it (he\u2019s compared me to the Angel of Death (the nazi) because I said I didn\u2019t love him, so I dont respect him). At any chance, he tries to exercise his power over me as a minor and guilt-trip me into respecting him (i drive you everywhere, i earn money so you can eat). Because of this, I dont like doing what he says. This pizza argument was the first time we\u2019ve flat out screamed at each-other. Its less about the pizza than it is about our relationship ig???", ">\\-he was the authority when mom is away,  \n>  \n>\\-I told him that\u2019s weaponized incompetence,   \n>  \n>\\-he called me pedantic   \n>  \n>\\-trying to  cop out of responsibility,   \n>  \n>\\-I told him he didn\u2019t participate socially enough in the family   \n>  \n>\\-I see him as a man-child   \n>  \n>\\-he ain\u2019t the breadwinner\n\nThis reads like someone fed the Best of Reddit Updates (kids below 18yo posts) through AI and it generated a post with a lot of the hot button phrases!", "ESH cause wtf is this dynamic", "ESH. Your family needs therapy. I get what you\u2019re trying to say about authoritarian parenting but there is also not enough info to condone your disrespect. You SHOULD respect your parent for parenting. You make it sound like he is a stepfather trying to replace your father. You say he doesn\u2019t do anything but that his complaint is that you don\u2019t do enough. You say he is the adult and should cook but then say he doesn\u2019t get to be the adult just because your mother is not home. This is bizarre. Seriously, for your mother\u2019s sake, consider family therapy. She must be losing her damn mind.", "ESH\n\nYou and your father seem to have a lot in common. Both of you rather put a lot more energy in fighting rather than just spend a tiny amount of energy to get shit done. Fights about principle are usually a waste.", "ESH. It is absurd of your father to claim that he doesn't know how to use an oven. It was absurd of you to pick an enormous fight over not wanting to put frozen pizza in the oven. You clearly don't respect your father as an authority figure. Everyone in this picture needs family therapy, and to order the pizza delivered next time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was a dumb arguement, but that behaviour is not how you parent. Yes parents are the authority,  but the bs of I'm your parent you need to respect me no matter what is setting people up to be stomped on later for boundaries.

My mother runs the house and everything else, and the moment she\u2019s gone, he tries to run things his way even though he doesn\u2019t know what needs to be done by who or anything. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t respect him, he claims a false position that he cannot fill, and expects us to play along. But I\u2019m 15. I\u2019m not supposed to be running the house. So, even if he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he should at least just ask for help, but he\u2019s too prideful to admit he doesn\u2019t know how to do things so he pushes his responsibilities on us.", "Oof.
