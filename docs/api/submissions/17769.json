Based on your comments, you have reached your emotional limit and your father took it one step further. You could have put the pizza in the oven and defused the situation, but my guess is that you were tired of seeing your father \u2018winning\u2019 and you \u2018losing\u2019.  So you rebelled. And your mother saw this coming, that\u2019s why she left instructions.  This is a very unhealthy family dynamic and way above a Reddit answer to address.

At any chance, he tries to exercise his power over me as a minor and guilt-trip me into respecting him (i drive you everywhere, i earn money so you can eat). Because of this, I dont like doing what he says. This pizza argument was the first time we\u2019ve flat out screamed at each-other.

You say he is the adult and should cook but then say he doesn\u2019t get to be the adult just because your mother is not home. This is bizarre.

So, even if he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he should at least just ask for help, but he\u2019s too prideful to admit he doesn\u2019t know how to do things so he pushes his responsibilities on us.", "Oof.
