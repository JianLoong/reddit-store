She says my comment hurt her feelings, and she's been distant ever since.

It might have been a joke to you, but to her, it came off as a jab at her. Whether you meant to hurt her or not, the fact is that you did.", ">maybe I should've known better\n\nYa think?\n\nYTA", "INFO: You said \"She jokingly mentioned how she felt a bit self-conscious about her appearance\"...and how do you know that was a joke?", "YTA. \n\nThink before you speak, it\u2019s that simple.", "Ughh what\u2019s with guys making \u201cjokes\u201d at their wife\u2019s expense lately??

And really gross how you asked \u201cis she just overreacting?\u201d \u2026double wtf.\n\nAs a woman who has been called fat before, trust me when I say she will never ever forget what you said. It will stay with her forever and you have some *serious* making up to do. She probably took it as \u201cmy husband thinks I\u2019m unattractive\u201d. Make her feel beautiful, own up to it and apologize multiple times (*without making excuses* like \u201cwhat I really meant was\u2026\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201d or \u201cit was just a joke!\u201d), give her flowers, etc. This is a big fucking deal.", "Your \"joke\" was offensive!!

You owe your wife a lot at this point.", "YTA for your initial comment, but I think you already know that. It\u2019s good that you\u2019ve apologized, it\u2019s always important to apologize for saying hurtful things. She\u2019s not wrong for still being hurt by it, hurtful (even if unintentional) comments from our loved ones can take a long time to get over. I\u2019ve read that the human brain is predisposed to latch onto negative remarks more than positive ones, so a comment where you\u2019re basically calling her fat will override most of the compliments you\u2019ve given her, and it will take awhile before your positive words have the same impact on her again.\n\nI think most of all she needs time. But it\u2019d also be helpful to sit down together and talk about areas and topics that could be hurtful when teased about. Set boundaries. A teasing relationship is great, but when clear lines aren\u2019t drawn, sometimes we can accidentally hurt each other. Show her in actions that you\u2019re sorry, and that you want to work to improve this area of your relationship so this kind of hurt doesn\u2019t happen again. Also make a plan for what to do if either of you do accidentally hurt the other \u2014 maybe it\u2019s needing space or time to decompress, and reassuring that even if one forgives, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the pain is forgotten in that moment.", "YTA.

Here\u2019s the thing women are often expected to be a certain size, look a certain way, bounce back after pregnancy, wear make up, don\u2019t wear make up, society starts selling us on it as kids.

If people heard the things we say to each other\u2026 I really do get what you thought you were doing. I don\u2019t believe you even had unkind intentions. I don\u2019t know your wife, but perhaps your timing took any potential for humor out of the interaction. As a general rule, potential sensitive spots are avoided for this kind of teasing. Additionally, making fun of the thing she just expressed insecurity about is just not cool. \n\nYou\u2019ve apologized. She\u2019s still hurt. She\u2019ll take the time she takes to move on. I think you\u2019ve uncovered a thing you know not to do again. The best we can ever hope for is learning from our mistakes and doing better.

If she doesn't like teasing then she shouldn't do it herself, and remain serious all the time. You know she enjoys teasing you about whatever. And she is not going to stop doing it.

YTA", "Stop telling jokes, people. Leave the joke telling to the professionals!", "Just a heads up/ most people who the \u201cvertically challenged\u201d joke is made at don\u2019t like the joke either. It\u2019s just an insult . So yeah you picked a \u201cfat joke\u201d to make at your wife when she was already feeling self conscious. \n\nIt\u2019s very common that people don\u2019t like to hear those jokes at their expense.  The only people who think that kinda of joke is funny is the person who likes to make fun of others. It\u2019s Just mean", "How did you not see WHEN YOU SAID IT it was hurtful? did you think women get a kick out of being called fat, let alone by their partner?", "You seem very agreeable in these comments. It seems like you already knew you were in the wrong here. Why do you need reddit to tell you that again? Why didn't you just *sincerely* apologize (I'm getting a lot of \"I'm sorry if that hurt you\" vibes) for the hurt you clearly caused like any good partner would do?", ">my response could have come off as more hurtful than intended.\n\nWhy the equivocation? You KNOW your response did come off as more hurtful than intended.", "Yo when did chatGBT get married?", "You keep equivocating. You hurt you wife when ahe was down. End of story.\n\nYour wife will never be able to take any apology to heart that is full of \"I'm sorry if you...\" and \"I may have inadvertently..\" \"perhaps more than intended\" - UHG!\n\nYou made thoughtless and cruel comments, so own that you made thoughtless and cruel comments.", "It was a mistake mate we all make them you're both the ah if yous let a joke spoil things,take her out for a meal pull out all the stops and explain what happened and let her have her say and draw a line under it and move on bud.

You have done real damage to her self esteem and confidence, so not only is she upset at your hurtful comment she is also probably thinking some really mean thoughts about herself that your words have given validity.\n\nShe was vulnerable with you and you made a cruel comment at her expense. That will change how she thinks about you and herself for the worse for a long time. \n\nYou screwed up BIG time and the fact your trying to shift blame back to her for her \"overreaction\" is pathetic and gross. \n\nGo grovel at her feet and describe in detail how beautiful and perfect you think every inch of her body is.

I get it now\u2026apparently people are Satan because they know you have a small penis\u2026", "Maybe ask her if there is anything you can do. Or (and this may backfire) next time you actually see her tell her she\u2019s looking beautiful today?", "Nah sorry. I understand your position but refuse it. Women are more emotional so things you say often stick with them. They can't rise above the words and see it for what it is. A joke", "Just don\u2019t insult your spouse.

That sort of thing is an attempt to distance oneself from his or her hurtful actions.", "Those are thoughtful suggestions. Asking her if there's anything I can do shows I'm willing to make amends and complimenting her genuinely on her appearance might help boost her confidence I want her to know that I find her attractive and beautiful every day. It genuinely confuses me why I blurted out something so hurtful, I know I'm usually the type to make light-hearted dad jokes, knowing they aren't always funny. I'm committed to making amends and ensuring she feels valued and cherished. I'll take your suggestions to heart and approach this with sincerity and care. Thanks for your insight.", "You can refuse it, it doesn\u2019t make it any less true. I\u2019d love to see what evidence you have to back up your claim. Evidence that is scientific, not just your perception because someone hurt you so you\u2019re projecting. There are plenty of women that can take a joke when it\u2019s funny. That\u2019s the thing, jokes are meant to be funny.", "Still don\u2019t joke about it.

Just apologize, say you fucked up royally and made a terrible joke that fell flat, and you feel awful about hurting the most important person in your life. If she brings it up, yeah you confirm that you find her beautiful and you love her deeply, but I don't think I'd be telling her she's beautiful a whole bunch at this point, it'd just ring hollow I think.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is later on, a month from now, 2 months from now, when it's sort of blown over a bit, is react strongly when she puts in effort next time. Not just \"you look nice tonight honey.\", I'm talking about a reaction that makes her feel special and warm inside, like you honestly were stunned at seeing her that night. She goes all out, hair, make-up, nice outfit you haven't seen before, drop a 'wow! I mean.... WOW! You look absolutely stunning tonight, honey, I'm going to be thinking about ripping that outfit off you the entire time we're out!'\n\nMaybe you don't say that last part, maybe you change the wording, it depends on your relationship and what you want to convey, but you get the gist, I'm sure.\n\nGood luck!", "yeah you definitely can't read the room. I never once suggested this wasn't anything more than anecdotal. The fact is enough anecdotal evidence adds up to become somesomething more legitimate once attention has been focused in that direction and a pattern has been spotted.
