You can google either one of those phrases. The idea is that you build a small but diverse wardrobe that can be dressed up or down with accessories.

Whilst I'm not quite as bad as your girlfriend, I have a similar problem. I've always struggled to dress appropriately. Or indeed, get dressed at all (!). Just the other day a supermarket security guard tipped me off, because I had my sweatshirt on inside out. And I'm 41\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe difference is I don't blame other people. To me, that DOES make your girlfriend childish. But it's like there's often a blindspot, when I'm getting dressed - even though I function fine in other areas of my life. I don't do it intentionally, and I can't really explain it - other than I'm not naturally a visibly observant person in general.\n\nFor example, I only discovered a few months ago, that my home of 17 years had a light switch near the front door (despite everyone else knowing). I also couldn't tell you what cars family members drive, despite being a passenger literally hundreds of times. I've never passed my driving test. I've tried countless times to train myself to be more visibly observant, but it never seems to change. \n\nSo I do wonder if it's some sort of difference in my brain. It MIGHT be similar for your girlfriend. I do understand your frustration. But maybe it would have been best to explore with your girlfriend calmly at first, why she frequently wears inappropriate clothes. Most people don't intentionally make life difficult for themselves, so she might not even know herself. \n\nMost people also shut down and stop listening, when they feel insulted/approached with anger - and 'childish' is usually an insult. If you tried it first calmly, and then she responded defensively, you would then be totally in the clear. But it might be linked to some 'blindspot' in her brain, that she isn't aware of.", "Heck she should now ask an ai and provide it a list of her wardrobe and it would tell her what to wear.", "I'm baffled that she wouldn't just...ask what to wear and/or check the weather.

You could try suggesting better choices, but it's up to her to take those suggestions.", "NAH\n\nAlthough the way you said it makes you a bit of an asshole. I dont think calling someone childish is the best approach. I do see where you are coming from. I know adults in their 40s who cant still grasp the basics of appropriate clothing. It's frustrating and concerning at times but in the end that's how they are for some reason or another. She might figure it out she might not. But this is something that in the long run if you keep excluding her from stuff can cause resentment between you. I'm not sure if this is something she can grasp or even wants to change about herself, so the question is: if she doesn't change are you willing to accept it without excluding her or resenting her in the long run?", "NTA.  I think lots of women that age/generation have been brought up, educated, conditioned by society, etc. to see themselves as the victim pretty much constantly, so many don't take criticism, even constructive, well-intentioned (and correct) criticism well.  A man telling such a woman how she should dress?  Not surprising that didn't go well.  You are kinda in a no win.  Sorry you are dealing with this.", "You are right but could've worded it better, avoiding a fight", "NTA. She especially needs to learn to dress correctly for certain activities like hiking or being outside. Or being smart for work or interviews. Hell, she could have even gone casual smart if she didn\u2019t want to dress too formally.\n\nAlso, if she\u2019s not learning from her mistakes when it comes to clothes, is she also repeating the same mistakes in other areas in her life and repeating the same mistakes because she\u2019s too stubborn to change.", "NTA, but I can't imagine what positive outcome you expected from this conversation\n\nmy wife is always cold.  never thinks to wear a jacket to situations where you know it will be cold, then asks for my jacket which means I'll be cold.\n\nSo I have a several blankets that stuff into their own bag and I keep them in every car we have and make a point to throw one in when we travel. I know she's not going to change, so part of my \"dress for the weather\" is preparing for her to not do so.", "YTA, because you're dating someone you neither like not respect.", "Although, it is surprising that you can actually purchase clothing while on vacation if you forgot to pack something.\n\nI am not talking about the head-banging notion of not bringing a winter coat to a cold climate - but I spent a month in Greece in September with essentially two carry-ons (I packed bags in my bags) and when something came up, I simply bought clothes for the event. I will admit, I packed carefully - 1 cotton sweater, 1 light jacket, 2 shorts, one pair of jeans, my all-purpose black dress, a few tops, and laundry detergent to wash everything as needed. \n\nOne windy day, I walked out in my flirty dress, the skirt blew up around my arms, and I turned back into the hotel, changed, and bought a pencil skirt at a nearby shop. :)", "*clean, good condition slacks and polo.\n\nI dated a guy who was fired repeatedly because he couldn't get that amendment though his head", "Same, had an ex who couldn't take responsibility for anything, everything was always someone else's fault. Those people rarely change.", ">It's possible she doesn't like being told what to wear, so intentionally dresses opposite of what you tell her.\n\nSo she's acting like a child then. OP is right.", "\n(light synth-pop NIN music in backround)\n\nI wanna dress you in Garanimals\n\nI see those taaags on the inside\n\nI wanna DRESS YOU IN GARANAMALS\n\nYour fashion sense is flawed\n\nYou wear the ones with the dog", "It\u2019s harder for us to dress than it is for most men, yes, but it\u2019s really a matter of common sense. I\u2019m a woman in my mid twenties and I am always complimented on how i dress, but it didn\u2019t used to be that way. The key to choosing the correct outfit for an occasion as a woman is simply this; when in doubt, choose the modest route. \n\nGoing to a dinner, and you\u2019re not sure of the vibe of the crowd in there? Go with the cute turtleneck and modest length skirt instead of the crop top and shorts. Match it with a Chelsea boot or basic, white heel to make it even cuter. \n\nGoing to a \u201ccasual\u201d outdoors function with business associates or the extended family of your loved one? Wear the pretty, modest length sundress and a cheap pair of sandals or open toed heels, instead of the revealing bralet and again, short shorts.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say shorts and crop tops are simply never appropriate. It\u2019s just you have to be select about them as individuals pieces in your wardrobe. Like, i could attend either of those events in a crop top and shorts and still be dressed appropriate. How? Because said crop top is a collared, button down blouse that meets the brim of the mid-thigh, highwaisted shorts im wearing. There is no mid drift showing, and the overall style of the outfit reads as classy casual, girlish but still sophisticated.\n\nAnd lastly, make up, hair, and accessories play a huge role in the overall cohesive look of an outfit. If i were to pair that last outfit I just mentioned with a pair of giant, gold hoops, teased hair, and a Smokey eye it immediately goes from classy cute to trashy and cheap. \n\nI know this seems like a lot, but again, it\u2019s common sense. As women, we all know what is appropriate and what is not. It\u2019s just some women are willing to wear an outfit inappropriate for a certain occasion because they think it makes them look prettier or more attractive, and they take that risk either to make themselves feel more confident or because they just like the attention. i know because I used to do it myself back when I was younger, and it was because I was insecure and thought I could get away with wearing whatever I wanted so long as I looked hot (and surprise, I couldn\u2019t)", "The wording was a bit harsh but overall NTA, especially since her refusal to be realistic about clothing ends up affecting you and anyone else with you by cutting the activity short or her complaining about how she's uncomfortable half the time. I'd also argue that it *is* childish (or at least wildly immature) to be unable or unwilling to accept personal responsibility for her role in these issues and instead just complaining that it's all \"unfair\" and someone else's fault. Do you comment about what she should wear beforehand and she ignores that? Based on the few examples you've given in which she dresses incredibly impractical, it sounds like she's more concerned with just \"looking cute\" than dressing for the situation. But if you're going to prioritize \"looking cute\" you need to accept that there will be consequences, like discomfort, and you need to suck it up and deal with it, not ruin someone else's time.", "Info : did you try to talk to her and 'teach' her for lack of a better word to dress appropriately? Did you explained why it's a bad Idea to wear sandals instead of sport shoes on the hike for example? \n\nI know most people know what's appropriate and what's not but there are some who need explaining. Does she accept to learn or does she ignores you if you try to explain and show her?", "Agreed she's childish, but I still don't think it's OP's place to tell her how to dress -- treat her like an adult or leave. Everyone Sucks Here.", "Magic mirror on the wall, I'm my mother after all.\n\nAt least that's what my mom always said.", "I respectfully disagree.  When I taught Advisory at my last high school, not only did I teach kids how to create a resume and help them with interview techniques, I also had them conduct an interview with me wearing appropriate attire.  While I realize not all high schools do that, this information is out there, readily available.  She had plenty of time to figure this out before the pandemic.", "No. If she doesn't dress appropriately, she doesn't get to complain. Either she grows up, or she needs to shut up.\n\nShe can't moan about life being unfair and then get angry, because someone told that she is the issue, not others.", "I live in Minnesota. So my trunk has a lot of blankets and a heated throw in case shit gets really bad.\n\nPeople who can't dress appropriately for the situation and are over the age of 13 will get no sympathy from me.", "Yes everyone has their own right and you are right to a degree I\u2019d say. What I\u2019m saying in simple terms is, if the girl doesn\u2019t want to change the way she dresses for the better even though her boyfriend does not like it, she is breaking his boundary for that. It doesn\u2019t seem fixable, there are girls who already know how to dress and what is appropriate without having it brought up. Guys typically don\u2019t want their girlfriend dressing in club clothes without them.", "I don't think that's a boundary but that'd just be arguing semantics and there's no point in that.\n\nExactly, there are girls out there with an acute sense of what to wear for different social situations. If that's what someone wants, date a girl like that. \n\nIt's not fixable because you don't \"fix\" your partner, you don't get with someone knowing something about them makes you uncomfortable, and then expect them to change when you're together.\n\nI think it's interesting because usually if someone says \"I don't like X about my partner and I expect them to change that for me\" most people would say that's unrealistic, never works and only leads to someone getting hurt emotionally.", "NTA but i wonder if this is a weaponized incompetence thing. She doesn't actually want to hike or go to the event so she wears the wrong items on purpose, forcing you to stop or leave early. Maybe she doesn't actually want to work so she blew the interview on purpose. Regardless of whether it's intentional or not, it would frustrate the hell out of me.", "\u2018Two revealing\u2019?\nYou\u2019ve got bigger problems,like grammar.", "YTA. You used personal insults. Instead of trying to help her, you just criticized her. Instead of hiding her from work events, could you not help her pick out an outfit?\n\nPlus, I get the feeling these are all one-time mistakes that you cling to out of spite. Just break up if you don\u2019t respect her.", "NTA. A softer delivery was possible... but it also sounds like maybe she needed to hear the more blunt version in order for it to sink in. If it's costing her Jon opportunities then she needs to know. \n\nI solved a similar problem in an old relationship by making him watch shows like Project Runway with me. It helped him create a mental picture for what was expected in a given scenario.", "NTA.  Nothing you said is incorrect and since it keeps biting her - an in the case of events you two do together you as well - in the ass with no changes being more blunt in your method of communication is quite justified.", "NTA, she sounds tiring", "NTA\n\nThis kind of behavior is a pain in the ass. \n\nI've known people to do things like this so that they can get out of an activity early that they don't really want to do. I wonder if that's going on with things like the hiking shoes/sandals and/or the coat at the outdoor event and leaving early because she's freezing.\n\nI get that everyone wants to have free will, but when a partner's choices impact the ability of both partners to do things that they've agreed they're going to do together, then the partner who made the bad choices owns the negative consequences.", "NTA\n\nHow did your girlfriend make it to 25 without knowing what to wear to a job interview?

Some people don't have professionals in their family to help them understand what's appropriate attire. Maybe she never hiked or traveled growing up. It does sound frustrating though because obviously she has access to the Internet and can figure this stuff out. I grew up middle class and figured stuff out as I was exposed to it but I once shared an office with a girl who grew up very wealthy.
