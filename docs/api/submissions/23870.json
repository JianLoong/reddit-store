You can google either one of those phrases. The idea is that you build a small but diverse wardrobe that can be dressed up or down with accessories.

If that kind of thing is normal for her it\u2019s going to be a problem throughout her life, so better she figure it out now.\n\nThat said, brining up your concerns and giving advice etc. is totally fine, but saying she\u2019s childish is\u2026less than diplomatic, let\u2019s just say.

Whilst I'm not quite as bad as your girlfriend, I have a similar problem. I've always struggled to dress appropriately. Or indeed, get dressed at all (!). Just the other day a supermarket security guard tipped me off, because I had my sweatshirt on inside out. And I'm 41\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe difference is I don't blame other people. To me, that DOES make your girlfriend childish. But it's like there's often a blindspot, when I'm getting dressed - even though I function fine in other areas of my life. I don't do it intentionally, and I can't really explain it - other than I'm not naturally a visibly observant person in general.\n\nFor example, I only discovered a few months ago, that my home of 17 years had a light switch near the front door (despite everyone else knowing). I also couldn't tell you what cars family members drive, despite being a passenger literally hundreds of times. I've never passed my driving test. I've tried countless times to train myself to be more visibly observant, but it never seems to change. \n\nSo I do wonder if it's some sort of difference in my brain. It MIGHT be similar for your girlfriend. I do understand your frustration. But maybe it would have been best to explore with your girlfriend calmly at first, why she frequently wears inappropriate clothes. Most people don't intentionally make life difficult for themselves, so she might not even know herself. \n\nMost people also shut down and stop listening, when they feel insulted/approached with anger - and 'childish' is usually an insult. If you tried it first calmly, and then she responded defensively, you would then be totally in the clear. But it might be linked to some 'blindspot' in her brain, that she isn't aware of.", "Heck she should now ask an ai and provide it a list of her wardrobe and it would tell her what to wear.", "I'm baffled that she wouldn't just...ask what to wear and/or check the weather.

But this is something that in the long run if you keep excluding her from stuff can cause resentment between you.

I\u2019m a woman in my mid twenties and I am always complimented on how i dress, but it didn\u2019t used to be that way. The key to choosing the correct outfit for an occasion as a woman is simply this; when in doubt, choose the modest route. \n\nGoing to a dinner, and you\u2019re not sure of the vibe of the crowd in there?

It\u2019s just you have to be select about them as individuals pieces in your wardrobe. Like, i could attend either of those events in a crop top and shorts and still be dressed appropriate. How? Because said crop top is a collared, button down blouse that meets the brim of the mid-thigh, highwaisted shorts im wearing. There is no mid drift showing, and the overall style of the outfit reads as classy casual, girlish but still sophisticated.\n\nAnd lastly, make up, hair, and accessories play a huge role in the overall cohesive look of an outfit. If i were to pair that last outfit I just mentioned with a pair of giant, gold hoops, teased hair, and a Smokey eye it immediately goes from classy cute to trashy and cheap. \n\nI know this seems like a lot, but again, it\u2019s common sense. As women, we all know what is appropriate and what is not. It\u2019s just some women are willing to wear an outfit inappropriate for a certain occasion because they think it makes them look prettier or more attractive, and they take that risk either to make themselves feel more confident or because they just like the attention. i know because I used to do it myself back when I was younger, and it was because I was insecure and thought I could get away with wearing whatever I wanted so long as I looked hot (and surprise, I couldn\u2019t)", "The wording was a bit harsh but overall NTA, especially since her refusal to be realistic about clothing ends up affecting you and anyone else with you by cutting the activity short or her complaining about how she's uncomfortable half the time.

Based on the few examples you've given in which she dresses incredibly impractical, it sounds like she's more concerned with just \"looking cute\" than dressing for the situation.
