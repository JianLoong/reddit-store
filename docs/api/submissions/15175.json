I, along with the other new hires, will be in classroom-style training over the next 2 months.\n\nOur 15-person training class is all on the same schedule, including lunch breaks. Most of us have lunch as a large group with some people breaking off into smaller groups or eating lunch alone, all depending on what the person wants that day. We eat in a large dining area that has several seating options. The campus also has several smaller dining areas outside and in other indoor spaces.\n\nOne of my coworkers, Kathy, has misophonia. I\u2019m somewhat familiar with it and it sounds like hell. She told me that she has trouble in the training sessions because one guy next to her chews ice nearly all day. She hasn\u2019t told him anything. One time a guy ate Doritos at lunch and Kathy stared at him like she wanted to reach across the table and strangle him.\n\nKathy also has a problem with my eating choices. I usually bring a large salad for lunch, which often takes me a good portion of our lunch break to eat. \n\nShe\u2019s started staring daggers making snide comments like \u201cDid you really have to eat that entire thing?\u201d and \u201cYou really like crunchy food, don\u2019t you?\u201d It\u2019s not fun having someone so closely observe and comment on your eating habits. At first I ignored her, but she kept commenting. Then I\u2019d just smile and reply, \u201cWhy yes I did have to eat the entire thing so I\u2019m not hungry later and yes, I do like crunchy food.\u201d The unsolicited comments continued. Eventually I just said, \u201cKathy, this is a dining area. The primary function of the space is for people to eat in it. If you have a problem with eating noises, *maybe* an eating space isn\u2019t the logical place for you to spend extra time in, eh?\u201d\n\nKathy looked upset and some of the coworkers who heard got quiet for a bit before continuing their conversations. She\u2019s been in sulky mood since.\n\nI think Kathy can block out eating noises when she\u2019s distracted by her own meal, but since it takes me longer to eat, my noises become the only eating noises for a while.\n\nI empathize that Kathy probably feels like she can\u2019t catch a break all day at work. Also  I want to acknowledge that there\u2019s a benefit to eating with others at work \u2014 it\u2019s a time to bond and network. So in removing herself, she\u2019d miss out a bit.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted because I likely *could* figure out another lunch to pack that\u2019s quieter and/or faster to eat. I know that she can\u2019t help how she feels. But I also don\u2019t appreciate her attitude and honestly, I like the lunches I pack since they make me feel satisfied and energized. They don\u2019t make me feel bloated or sluggish after eating them like so many other things do. I also don\u2019t want to remove myself and miss out on time with my coworkers because they\u2019re fun people.", "created_utc": 1681909431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rslt0/aita_for_eating_salad/", "score": 860, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are 100% correct that usually when someone is eating themselves they are not bothered by other people eating. The main problem here is that Kathy is trying to control other\u2019s behavior, when she needs to control her own.

She needs to leave the room or find another alternative like headphones so that she is not taking out her issues on other people.", "NTA.

You were correct: for someone who has misophonia this severely, sitting in a dining area isn\u2019t the best choice. Other people shouldn\u2019t need to stop eating or have commentary about what they\u2019re eating just because she has this issue. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is going out of their way to eat in a disgusting manner either. Chewing ice, crunching chips, and eating salad is just how you consume those foods. Is everyone supposed to eating pudding so she can sit in the lunchroom? Your response was fair and polite imo. She likely realized you were right and is pouting.", "NTA this is why reasonable accommodations exist. Kathy needs to work with HR to determine reasonable accommodations for herself.

It is actually a neurological condition, I don't remember the exact details, but there is some part of the brain that essentially sends sounds from the ear to the brain, and that part is thicker for those with misophonia, which makes it so that these noises set off a fight or flight response. Therapy may help as far as certain coping skills, but it will never make the problem disappear. Honestly, as a misophonia sufferer, I feel for her, but it is not everyone else's job to accommodate her, at least not in the lunchroom.

Misophonia makes your body react with adrenaline and norepeniphrine and can cause severe rage.  Verbal aggression is a very common symptom.  She probably feels like OP is deliberately taunting her by bringing food they know will upset her.  Logically, I'm sure she knows it's not true, but every bite to her feels like 10 of her comments to him bundled into one.  She might honestly not be able to control herself - she probably even feels like she IS controlling herself by only making snide remarks.  I suffer from it too, and it's amazing how fast my mood can go from \"happy\" to \"one more bite and I will beat you to death with this table.\" (5 crunches if you're curious, 3 if it's my ex who chews so loudly I can hear it from the other room over a movie playing while wearing noise cancelling headphones).\n\nThat said, it's really something she needs to learn how to manage for herself.  Remove herself from the situation, earplugs, find some way to distract herself, sit with someone who skips lunch etc.  When you have a condition like that, you NEED to learn how to cope in public spaces.  ESPECIALLY in an environment where you need to behave professionally.\n\nOP it's not your responsibility and you're NTA, but if you like her maybe bring some chewing gum and offer it to her as an olive branch.  If she's chewing on something your food probably won't annoy her as much.", "You are definitely NTA. She just has to deal with eating noises in an eating space.\n\n>she has trouble in the training sessions because one guy next to her chews ice nearly all day. She hasn\u2019t told him anything.\n\nAnd I wonder why she is admonishing you and not the guy who chews ice nearly all day next to her during the training sessions? I would think that is much worse for her than your eating salad noises as it is in a place where she needs to pay attention and is distracted by the ice chewing. And chewing ice all the time is also way more uncommon than eating salad.\n\nAre you a woman and he is an intimidating guy she is not brave enough to confront or what is going on there?", "\"Bathroom contribution\" sounds like something from Aperture Science. Like \"Please complete your bathroom contribution, and the Bathroom Contribution Associate will be along to clean up.\"", "If OP is a woman, it could also be that Kathy is too intimidated to say anything to the other coworkers, who seem to be men. I\u2019ve worked with women who don\u2019t feel comfortable rocking the boat with male coworkers. Not saying Kathy is right, but gender could play an issue here. Regardless NTA and Kathy needs to find a way to not make her problem become other peoples\u2019 problem.", "Yeah, I like to monch on the ice once I'm done with my drink. IDK why, I just do and I don't have anemia, or at least didn't last I checked", "Oooh I was wondering why someone would message me instead of just commenting. Thanks for explaining!", "Yes! It was weird to get that kind of message.", ">a few exceptions who I feel safe to be around when they eat because they are considerate of my condition *without me asking*\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what do those people do that helps alleviate some of the issues? Other than \"don't chew open-mouthed like a cow,\" I have no idea what someone could do.", "I also have misophonia, but Loops sadly did nothing for me. I tried Flare as well, nothing. It sucks, I've struggled with this since I was 2 or 3 years old. High school was hell. But yeah, nowadays, I make sure to always keep earplugs and earbuds with me always, and I try to keep myself out of noisy situations I can't escape.", "I just did a search for them.  Thank you!  I have misophonia, and these sound amazing.  Also ordering a pair for my 15 year old grandson with ADHD to help block out classroom sound.", "My stepsisters were like that. After they left, it took me years to learn to be able to slowly enjoy and savor meals again, instead of shoving my dinner into my mouth as quickly as possible so I could get away from them.", "I also recommend Loops! They are super helpful!", "Just curious, but why bananas?  They seem pretty quiet to me.", ">Other than \"don't chew open-mouthed like a cow,\" \n\nPretty much that. They're conscious of how they eat and drink to not slurp, smack, or scrape their cutlery. I find with these people (husband, sister, father) I can actually tolerate any noises they do make much better than I normally could because I know they're truly making an effort not to so my brain gets less angry. I still notice it and have a small reaction but it goes away almost instantly. \n\n\nOn the other hand is my mother who for years tried to make noises as some sort of exposure therapy. Even though she doesn't anymore I still find myself getting tense eating with her if she accidentally does one of those things (she has impeccable manners so it was truly done on purpose back then and is truly an accident now).", "Usually have some, but sometimes even that isn't enough.", "Oh damn.
