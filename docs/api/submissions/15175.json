I, along with the other new hires, will be in classroom-style training over the next 2 months.\n\nOur 15-person training class is all on the same schedule, including lunch breaks. Most of us have lunch as a large group with some people breaking off into smaller groups or eating lunch alone, all depending on what the person wants that day. We eat in a large dining area that has several seating options. The campus also has several smaller dining areas outside and in other indoor spaces.\n\nOne of my coworkers, Kathy, has misophonia. I\u2019m somewhat familiar with it and it sounds like hell. She told me that she has trouble in the training sessions because one guy next to her chews ice nearly all day. She hasn\u2019t told him anything. One time a guy ate Doritos at lunch and Kathy stared at him like she wanted to reach across the table and strangle him.\n\nKathy also has a problem with my eating choices. I usually bring a large salad for lunch, which often takes me a good portion of our lunch break to eat. \n\nShe\u2019s started staring daggers making snide comments like \u201cDid you really have to eat that entire thing?\u201d and \u201cYou really like crunchy food, don\u2019t you?\u201d It\u2019s not fun having someone so closely observe and comment on your eating habits. At first I ignored her, but she kept commenting. Then I\u2019d just smile and reply, \u201cWhy yes I did have to eat the entire thing so I\u2019m not hungry later and yes, I do like crunchy food.\u201d The unsolicited comments continued. Eventually I just said, \u201cKathy, this is a dining area. The primary function of the space is for people to eat in it. If you have a problem with eating noises, *maybe* an eating space isn\u2019t the logical place for you to spend extra time in, eh?\u201d\n\nKathy looked upset and some of the coworkers who heard got quiet for a bit before continuing their conversations. She\u2019s been in sulky mood since.\n\nI think Kathy can block out eating noises when she\u2019s distracted by her own meal, but since it takes me longer to eat, my noises become the only eating noises for a while.\n\nI empathize that Kathy probably feels like she can\u2019t catch a break all day at work. Also  I want to acknowledge that there\u2019s a benefit to eating with others at work \u2014 it\u2019s a time to bond and network. So in removing herself, she\u2019d miss out a bit.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted because I likely *could* figure out another lunch to pack that\u2019s quieter and/or faster to eat. I know that she can\u2019t help how she feels. But I also don\u2019t appreciate her attitude and honestly, I like the lunches I pack since they make me feel satisfied and energized. They don\u2019t make me feel bloated or sluggish after eating them like so many other things do. I also don\u2019t want to remove myself and miss out on time with my coworkers because they\u2019re fun people.", "created_utc": 1681909431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rslt0/aita_for_eating_salad/", "score": 1714, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There has to be a way for her to manage this other than expecting everyone around her to not eat crunchy food.", "NTA. A lot of people are bothered by the eating noises of other people. You are 100% correct that usually when someone is eating themselves they are not bothered by other people eating. The main problem here is that Kathy is trying to control other\u2019s behavior, when she needs to control her own.

She needs to leave the room or find another alternative like headphones so that she is not taking out her issues on other people.", "NTA.

You were correct: for someone who has misophonia this severely, sitting in a dining area isn\u2019t the best choice. Other people shouldn\u2019t need to stop eating or have commentary about what they\u2019re eating just because she has this issue. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is going out of their way to eat in a disgusting manner either. Chewing ice, crunching chips, and eating salad is just how you consume those foods. Is everyone supposed to eating pudding so she can sit in the lunchroom? Your response was fair and polite imo. She likely realized you were right and is pouting.", "NTA this is why reasonable accommodations exist. Kathy needs to work with HR to determine reasonable accommodations for herself.

I\u2019ve encountered that when I play my drum for too long", "It makes my stomach feel weird which leads to me feeling sick because it feels all wobbly and jiggly. I can\u2019t really explain it which is why I think it\u2019s more related to autism sensory issues than anything else. \n\nBut thank you for that, I\u2019ll try and pay more attention to my body next time see if it could be inner-ear issue and my body is just sending signals to dumb places or I\u2019m just remembering feelings wrong again haha", "This is a hill I'm prepared to die on. The only thing it is ever acceptable to say about your coworkers food is how delicious it looks. If it's not going to literally kill you, it's none of your business what they eat or how they eat it. NTA in any way.", "NTA. Not your responsibility to accommodate her", "I share her aversion to loud chewing noises. It\u2019s my issue to ensure and contend with. If other\u2019s chewing was upsetting me, I\u2019d choose a different table, not a different menu for another.", "NTA.", "NTA  No matter her issue, she can't force you to acclimatize to her issues.   She needs to find a way to deal with it otherwise or walk away for a while.  In other words, her problem is not your problem.", "NTA \n\nIt's a difficult and irritating issue she's facing and that's fine , her feelings of discomfort are valid. \n\nIt ends there.  She doesn't get to make you feel uncomfortable due to her condition.", "NTA... her problem", "NTA. I feel like there are some people in the world who expect everyone else to accommodate their personal needs. That\u2019s just not reality. As others have said, Kathy had to figure this out, not you.", "Jumping on top comment to say she should look into the Flare calmer earplugs. It helps most people with misophonia and auditory processing disorder by dulling out high pitch sounds.\nIf those don't work. She should get the loop earplugs that muffle all sound(trade off for peace)", "Her disability, her responsibility.", "Yeah and I would say eating is more than a normal behaviour, it's required to stay alive. If OP likes to have a salad for lunch, good for them. OP isn't microwaving fish or something...", "I was wondering if they work\u2026thanks!", "As someone with audio sensory issues, I 110% endorse Loops.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe great thing about them for people who don't already know is they quiet ambient noises, but you can still hear. They come in different levels of how much quieter they make things.", "Mine is sniffling. Dear Gods flu and cold season at the office was living hell. I will always feel slightly ashamed about how much better my mental health has been since the pandemic sent my office to work from home.", "Don\u2019t feel ashamed! Offices aren\u2019t a pleasant environment for a lot of people. Working from home has been a moral/health boost for a lot of people!", "Nta.  She can put in ear buds and listen to music.", "NTA\n\nInteresting that she won\u2019t talk to the guy crunching ice for hours during her workday, but feels comfortable lashing out at you.\n\nHead to your training supervisor for advice. HR has restrictions because she has a diagnosis that may require accommodations, but prohibiting you from eating isn\u2019t  one. Make a log of her repeated complaints and comments on your food choices. I can appreciate you don\u2019t want to make waves as a new hire, but I don\u2019t see how this ends well for you if you don\u2019t loop in other people", "NTA. It's her responsibility to manage her own condition, not infringe upon other people's rights to eat food in a dining room.", "NTA No one is dictating Kathy's lunch break. She could eat in her car or wear noise canceling headphones.", "Exactly this. I have a hugeee elevator phobia(actually a phobia of being stuck) and if there\u2019s ever anything I won\u2019t do, I\u2019m not going to stop anyone else from it. I\u2019ll do my own thing.", "Lots of other comments have already chimed in, but here\u2019s my two cents as someone living with sensory issues / misophonia! \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely awful to live with. Both for me and people around me. When I was small, I would literally kick and punch my family because I didn\u2019t understand exactly why I was overcome with rage at dinner time. (Didn\u2019t help that my family also chewed louder on purpose as \u201cexposure therapy!\u201d Protip: it won\u2019t work. Looks like a lot of other people have experienced this too, haha)\n\nI no longer lash out, but I can say that the gut reaction is to fight/run. It\u2019s an overwhelming wave of anger and I am completely aware it\u2019s irrational. It is not controllable and it is like the drop on a roller coaster, except instead of gravity, it\u2019s anger. \n\nI prefer to eat alone so my problem doesn\u2019t become other people\u2019s problems, but if it\u2019s not possible, then yes! Anything that muffles sound or creates louder sounds / distractions helps! Even if I eat something crunchier, the sound of my own crunch can deafen the people around me. I have earbuds handy at all time ready to play music. \n\nThe comments about OP bringing even crunchier foods bother me, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s kind to egg someone on when they likely know it\u2019s irrational and are normally totally fine and decent. \n\nThe worst part is being unable to escape (either leaving the vicinity or having a distraction)- that is when I have to seek accommodations, like a separate test room in class- and people can\u2019t stop making human noises just because of me! I only hope to be treated with grace and empathy, and I appreciate the many people weighing in. Respect goes both ways, and OP\u2019s colleague may have forgotten this.\n\nETA:\nIt\u2019s not always crunchy foods! Literally any noise can trigger misophonia and it varies from person to person. I can\u2019t stand ANY eating or drinking, breathing, sniffling, coughing, or clearing throats. Yeah. It\u2019s rough, but I do my best to cope without intruding on other people.", "That user is 100% wrong on every point.\n\nYou do _not_ have to modify your lunches. You can consider doing so, but you do not have to.\n\nSoft foods don\u2019t make no noise, they just make different noises. And may not be to your taste.\n\nEating somewhere away from Kathy would depend on how big the dining area is and whether Kathy was choosing to sit near you in the first place so she could make her snide comments. But that\u2019s not on you; it\u2019s on Kathy to not sit near you and your salad if it causes her a problem.\n\nThe last bit is the doozy though. Just no. If Kathy is not eating, she does _not_ have the right to be in the dining hall without hearing people eating. She has the right to still be in the dining hall, but absolutely does not have the right to not hear crunching or to police anybody\u2019s food.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA and should eat whatever makes you happy.", "Thank you so much :)", "True His attitude is fucked. I keep womdering, tho. I can not stand hearing people smack their food. Smacking sounds from chewing with your mouth open is an easy, polite thing to do - just shut your mouth!"]}
