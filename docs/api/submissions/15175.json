I, along with the other new hires, will be in classroom-style training over the next 2 months.\n\nOur 15-person training class is all on the same schedule, including lunch breaks. Most of us have lunch as a large group with some people breaking off into smaller groups or eating lunch alone, all depending on what the person wants that day. We eat in a large dining area that has several seating options. The campus also has several smaller dining areas outside and in other indoor spaces.\n\nOne of my coworkers, Kathy, has misophonia. I\u2019m somewhat familiar with it and it sounds like hell. She told me that she has trouble in the training sessions because one guy next to her chews ice nearly all day. She hasn\u2019t told him anything. One time a guy ate Doritos at lunch and Kathy stared at him like she wanted to reach across the table and strangle him.\n\nKathy also has a problem with my eating choices. I usually bring a large salad for lunch, which often takes me a good portion of our lunch break to eat. \n\nShe\u2019s started staring daggers making snide comments like \u201cDid you really have to eat that entire thing?\u201d and \u201cYou really like crunchy food, don\u2019t you?\u201d It\u2019s not fun having someone so closely observe and comment on your eating habits. At first I ignored her, but she kept commenting. Then I\u2019d just smile and reply, \u201cWhy yes I did have to eat the entire thing so I\u2019m not hungry later and yes, I do like crunchy food.\u201d The unsolicited comments continued. Eventually I just said, \u201cKathy, this is a dining area. The primary function of the space is for people to eat in it. If you have a problem with eating noises, *maybe* an eating space isn\u2019t the logical place for you to spend extra time in, eh?\u201d\n\nKathy looked upset and some of the coworkers who heard got quiet for a bit before continuing their conversations. She\u2019s been in sulky mood since.\n\nI think Kathy can block out eating noises when she\u2019s distracted by her own meal, but since it takes me longer to eat, my noises become the only eating noises for a while.\n\nI empathize that Kathy probably feels like she can\u2019t catch a break all day at work. Also  I want to acknowledge that there\u2019s a benefit to eating with others at work \u2014 it\u2019s a time to bond and network. So in removing herself, she\u2019d miss out a bit.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted because I likely *could* figure out another lunch to pack that\u2019s quieter and/or faster to eat. I know that she can\u2019t help how she feels. But I also don\u2019t appreciate her attitude and honestly, I like the lunches I pack since they make me feel satisfied and energized. They don\u2019t make me feel bloated or sluggish after eating them like so many other things do. I also don\u2019t want to remove myself and miss out on time with my coworkers because they\u2019re fun people.", "created_utc": 1681909431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rslt0/aita_for_eating_salad/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There has to be a way for her to manage this other than expecting everyone around her to not eat crunchy food.", "NTA. A lot of people are bothered by the eating noises of other people. You are 100% correct that usually when someone is eating themselves they are not bothered by other people eating. The main problem here is that Kathy is trying to control other\u2019s behavior, when she needs to control her own.

She needs to leave the room or find another alternative like headphones so that she is not taking out her issues on other people.", "NTA.

You were correct: for someone who has misophonia this severely, sitting in a dining area isn\u2019t the best choice. Other people shouldn\u2019t need to stop eating or have commentary about what they\u2019re eating just because she has this issue. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is going out of their way to eat in a disgusting manner either. Chewing ice, crunching chips, and eating salad is just how you consume those foods. Is everyone supposed to eating pudding so she can sit in the lunchroom? Your response was fair and polite imo. She likely realized you were right and is pouting.", "NTA this is why reasonable accommodations exist. Kathy needs to work with HR to determine reasonable accommodations for herself.

The onus is on her", "NTA. It isn\u2019t reasonable to get upset at people eating in the dining area.", "Sorry, no. I also have misophonia and it is MY problem to deal with not the people who are making the sounds that effect me. If the noises bother Kathy so much, she should be the one to adjust- whether it\u2019s not spending time in the lunch area or wearing noise canceling headphones. Don\u2019t feel bad about this and continue to enjoy your large, crunchy salad. \n\nNTA", "NTA. you can move away from her to eat, but ultimately it's on her to mitigate her own issues. Earplugs are a great invention.", "If you have a condition or phobia then the onus is on you (in this case Kathy) to manage it.

Especially if everyone is aware of it they know I'm not being rude but avoiding a meltdown. People also tend to warn me they are about to eat something loud and it helps so I can either brace or leave. I very much appreciate everyone accommodations but they aren't required because only I am responsible for me. \n\nI feel her pain. I haven't been to the movies in so many years i lost count because it wasn't worth it anymore for me. It sucks, but you don't need to change anything. \n\nIf you do want to put in more effort than you need to, you can acknowledge the sounds before she does, but again that isn't necessary, though it will help her know that you're at least trying to be considerate of her and want her around, but that fair warning you still gotta eat. Nta.", "NTA\nI have misophonia and one of my biggest issues is eating noises, including my own eating noises. So I watch or listen to something while I eat alone, and whenever possible I wear headphones and play music when I eat with others. (Obviously I can't do it all the time).  I don't get on other people's case about it, because it's not their problem, it's mine, and therefore I am the only one that needs to change anything to deal with it. She needs to realize that.", "NTA. Kathy can go eat outside or in the bathroom.", "NTA\n\nWhile it's nice of you if you want to try to make things easier for her, it's not your responsibility to do so and she is being unreasonable by complaining about people doing normal stuff. It'd be different if you were doing things to make her uncomfortable on purpose.", "NTA. Dude, this one is as basic as they come. Kathy has misophonia. I personally have allergies and weird ADHD-related shit. You have a salad. It's not your fault that you have the most sensible thing. If I need to go to a function, I either just drink, bring my own food, or pick something that probably won't kill me. Kathy can bring earplugs or remove herself from the area. IMO your reaction was perfectly reasonable. In fact, if Kathy's behavior continues, you'd be more than within your rights to report her to HR. She's responsible for causing an issue and souring the mood during your breaks.", "Buddy of mine has misophonia. When we\u2019re at his house he bumps the music and sits closer the the speakers until dinner is over. When he\u2019s at ours he pops in one earbud as a distraction. \n\nShe can figure it out.

Does it fill be with rage when people crunch near me? Yes. Do I say something? No. I leave the room or put in headphones. \nSounds like Kathy needs to eat lunch alone and take some personal time.

She needs de-escalation time.\nI would only ever say something to live in partners or longtime friends and I certainly don\u2019t remind them constantly.", "NTA. Kathy is. She should get some ear plugs or ear buds or go take a walk when she\u2019s finished eating or something. Constantly hassling ppl about what they\u2019re eating is very annoying.", "NTA. I have that and absolutely hate the sounds of eating so I wear earbuds. Problem solved.", "NTA. I have misophonia and it's my problem. I simply remove myself if the sounds of someone eating bother me. I especially have no rights to demand anything in a space designated for people to eat.", "NTA Kathy needs to remove herself from the lunchroom to deal with her issue, not make demands of others.", "NTA. Headphones can be her friend....", "NTA.  Usually I would say go to HR, but you are a month into the job and that would throw a ton of red flags for your employer.  It\u2019s up to her yo manage her misophonia and her choosing to sit in a dining area instead of leaving is a her problem.  I would be tempted the next time she starts in on you that what she is doing is harassing you for eating in the dining area and she needs to stop and leave if it is a problem for her, that her request for accommodation is unreasonable when she has the option to leave.", "NTA \n\nSo she\u2019s not using any sort of ear pod things to minimize background noise, she isn\u2019t removing herself from the area, and she feels entitled to make snarky remarks about your meals.

I don't go anywhere without my loops so I'm more comfortable in our repetitively noisy world", "NTA", "By now she has learned that the world continues to turn whether she is there or not.  Her annoyance and carping at you to try to spoil your lunch is simply her being petty.

All she had to do was sit somewhere else.  Same with Dorito guy.\n\nShe has plenty of options to spend her lunch break away from people who are chewing near her.  But she doesn\u2019t.  Instead she wants to be social at the cost of people continuing to eat crunchy food after she has finished her food.  By the way, does she ever eat crunchy food?\n\nHer disability is not everyone else\u2019s obligation to suffer. Perhaps the next time she sits with or near you, you can move a good distance away.

I am so sick of these people that act like the whole world has to bend to their will.", "NTA.\n\nI have misophonia, and eating noises are really, really terrible, but it's Kathy's responsibility to handle. She can wear earplugs, excuse herself from the room, or develop coping mechanisms. It's unreasonable for her to expect everyone else to miss out on lunch or only pack food that she can tolerate.", "NTA. Misophonia can make someone rage, but it's not everyones job to make changes around this person. It's not practical and unfair. I get that misophonia causes rage, but that doesn't excuse how she talked to you. She needs to take precautionary measures to avoid getting upset with people living their lives. And it's also not your problem that the guy ate doritos, her not saying anything, and instead yelling at you because she feels it was easier to target you.", "I have this problem. A bit. I don't think it's as severe as Kathy's though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI deal with it myself.  Silently. Because I have no right to forbid people from eating, or eating food they choose, just because my stupid brain has decided eating noises should really be annoying to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEat your salad.

Kathy is otherwise very nice and chill \u2014 a real salt-of-the-earth person. I hope she considers earbuds for her sake.", "NTA - I also struggle with misophonia. In my case it\u2019s a PTSD response and taking mood stabilizers has helped temper my emotional response. This may or may not be true in Kathy\u2019s case. But it is ABSOLUTELY Kathy\u2019s issue to resolve.", "NTA  I also have misophonia and this is correct.", "I agree with you.  I think the \"reasonable accommodation\" for Kathy is go eat elsewhere rather than harass other employees in the lunch room.", "Same. I have misophonia so I adjust accordingly. It is unreasonable of Kathy to sit in an eating room and expect everyone to eat silent food. \n\nOP is NTA", "Yup! It sucks that it has to be this way, but you can't really be mad at people for eating lol. I have it too, and I've learned to (1) eat lunch at strange times at work while other people aren't in the kitchen, (2) put on TV or something while eating with my partner, and (3) just suck it up/breathe through the rising feelings of rage when it's impossible to avoid others or add some sort of background noise to drown out the eating sounds.\n\nThat being said, I have a lot of sympathy for Kathy. My partner grew up in a family where everyone chews their food with their mouth open(!!!) and his mom constantly eats salad or apples and having her mouth full of food doesn't stop her from talking. Family meals with them can be frustrating.", "THIS. I have it as well and I leave the room or put on headphones. It seriously annoys my dh to look over and see me with my noise canceling headphones on during a meal but that's the only way I can deal with it. \n\nI can't fault other people for eating a meal so I do what I can to control \\*my\\* issue.", "Also have misophonia. We eat with the tv on in my house, and when it\u2019s really bad, I often ask my husband to wait to eat until I can get the show started. Even my own chewing bothers me. I understand the pure rage she\u2019s feeling, and how each sound is like daggers to the ears, but it\u2019s up to her (and me) to control. At work, I usually wore earbuds and played soft music while eating with others - just low enough that I could hear people talk and hold conversations, but enough to drown or subdue chewing sounds.", "Yeah, I have misophonia and I married into a Taiwanese-American family. I deal with it by joining the family for rice meals, and eating on my own for just about anything else, and it worked out fine.", "THIS. I bring earbuds for my lunch break. Music blocks out the chewing, problem solved. You've got it.", "hahaha, my son is autistic and just... chews really loudly LOL. i basically have noise canceling headphones at the dinner table :D that way, i'm not nagging him every 2 seconds to PLEASE close your mouth when you chew.", "Selectively, it seems. She sits right next to someone in class all day who crunches ice nonstop and says nothing, yet snarks at OP for eating in the room where people, you know, eat.  So she's comfortable trying to control OP but doesn't speak up to someone she's not necessarily sure won't push right back. I don't like bullies or cowards.\n\nI'm ridiculously anemic and crave ice NONSTOP. I don't eat it next to people and would never eat it all day in a classroom. I eat it in my office bc that's my space.  Kathy would be more justified to ask them to stop eating it in the classroom or just ask to be seated elsewhere.", "Sorry the phrase \u201cbathroom contribution\u201d is too funny lol.

I'd gladly give up ever watching TV or movies ever again but will fight you bloody if you tried to take away my music.

We can\u2019t bring peanuts or uncooked apples to my work because we have two coworkers who can\u2019t be in the same room as those things.

What a moron", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s true. I\u2019ll cry into my salad now.", "Can you explain how?", "I have it too and I think it's interesting that your own eating noises are a trigger. The sound of my own loud gum chewing/food chewing (which I only ever do when I'm by myself because I certainly know how angry those sounds make *me* lol) don't bother me. Also, I find my trigger noises easier to deal with if I make the same noises too.", "I sometimes have to chew with my mouth open because of TMJ *BUT* when I chew with my mouth open I put a hand over my mouth to avoid it being as loud. Also have Misophonia and it bothers me that I'm so loud \ud83d\ude23", "Yeah I missed my misophonia for years because my mom\u2019s eating was the biggest trigger\u2014but my mom also overstuffs her mouth so much that she *can\u2019t* close her mouth when she\u2019s chewing and bits of food actually fall out. She also likes to throw in lots of \u201cmmmmmmm\u201ds and talk with her mouth full. So, in addition to the sloppy chewing sounds\u2026there was all of *that*. Turns out sloppy chewing sounds bother me too, but there are so many additional factors there that would gross out just about anyone.", "I agree generally, but I think there are exceptions. I have youngish children right now and when they get excited at the dinner table, they forget to chew with their mouths closed. I always ask them if they can breathe through their nose (we have a lot of allergies in this family!), if they say yes I remind them to close their mouth but if they are congested I ask them to take smaller bites or cover their mouth for a bit after each bite since they need to breathe.", "It would not be a terrible idea for you to bring it up to her. If you do, be specific that you asked other people who have misophonia and many of them specifically recommended Loops. If she also has sensory issues,  though, that might not be helpful.  \n\nDefinitely offer her as much sympathy as you can, WITHOUT backtracking on your 100% reasonable observation that the purpose of a lunch room is for people to eat, and people are absolutely entitled to eat what they want. \n\nHot tuna dishes notwithstanding. :p \n\nShe might need reassurance that wearing earbuds won't be seen as rude or antisocial.  She might need some support to go to HR and request being allowed to wear earbuds or even over the ear headphones as a reasonable accommodation.  She definitely needs to be told that absolutely NO ONE is eating crunchy food AT her... even though it can feel that way. \n\nMy husband of 15 years  has misophonia, and someone he still struggles with reminding himself that no one is \"chomping and slurping\" AT him. Something about that condition can make it feel like a personal attack, and it's real work to remember that's not actually the case. Frankly, often my husband can't stand hearing HIMSELF eat. He has excellent earbuds and a VERY diverse music collection.  Without that, and my understanding that he can't help it and the music is NOT meant to shut me out, we'd have been divorced a long time ago.", "I feel the pain. Also folks who chew gum with their mouths open or talk while eating. AHHHHH\n\nI remove myself--that's what I can control.

To be fair, usually my own chewing isn't that big of a trigger and is only really a problem when I'm already irritated or overwhelmed.", "Oh wow THANK YOU for this recommendation!! I have misophonia, and my dh has sensitivity to certain sounds due to nerve damage. This will be a lifesaver for us both. Right now he just keeps spongy earplugs in all his clothes and I remove myself or play music on earphones etc when someone's eating.

Concert? I can perfectly hear the music but I don't hear the screams as much (and believe me, there were lots of screaming, I went to a TS concert), walking on the street? I can pay attention to my surroundings without having to suffer a big honk or loud motorbike, party? I can have a conversation, no need to ask to repeat every 5 seconds. Helps with my tintinus and I'm in much better spirits during loud events.", "Man, Loops are freaking awesome. The quality of what I can hear at a concert without hurting my ears is amazing. Hell, I wore them to see Rammstein and I was basically at the stage and my ears were perfectly happy afterwards.", "Well that's acceptable and you at least still cover your mouth. I sat in the lunch room at work and a guy was just chomping on whatever he brought, mouth open, it was loud and gross. I nearly murdered him and I don't have Misophonia.", "I don't have misophonia, but the idea of eating near someone who has food literally falling out of their mouth while they make noise and talk is repulsive. So sorry.", "That sounds like my personal fucking nightmare. My condolences.", "LOL. I've literally wanted to detach my own head, and place it outside the poo closet(the toilet in the master bath is separated from the rest) for my own contributions.", "oh now that\u2019s interesting, thank you!!! i sometimes enjoy eating ice to keep my mouth busy and stay hydrated XD", "You need to grab a bottle of Poo-pourri.
