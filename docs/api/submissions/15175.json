{"id": 15175, "submission_id": "12rslt0", "title": "AITA For Eating Salad", "selftext": "Last month I started a new job. I, along with the other new hires, will be in classroom-style training over the next 2 months.\n\nOur 15-person training class is all on the same schedule, including lunch breaks. Most of us have lunch as a large group with some people breaking off into smaller groups or eating lunch alone, all depending on what the person wants that day. We eat in a large dining area that has several seating options. The campus also has several smaller dining areas outside and in other indoor spaces.\n\nOne of my coworkers, Kathy, has misophonia. I\u2019m somewhat familiar with it and it sounds like hell. She told me that she has trouble in the training sessions because one guy next to her chews ice nearly all day. She hasn\u2019t told him anything. One time a guy ate Doritos at lunch and Kathy stared at him like she wanted to reach across the table and strangle him.\n\nKathy also has a problem with my eating choices. I usually bring a large salad for lunch, which often takes me a good portion of our lunch break to eat. \n\nShe\u2019s started staring daggers making snide comments like \u201cDid you really have to eat that entire thing?\u201d and \u201cYou really like crunchy food, don\u2019t you?\u201d It\u2019s not fun having someone so closely observe and comment on your eating habits. At first I ignored her, but she kept commenting. Then I\u2019d just smile and reply, \u201cWhy yes I did have to eat the entire thing so I\u2019m not hungry later and yes, I do like crunchy food.\u201d The unsolicited comments continued. Eventually I just said, \u201cKathy, this is a dining area. The primary function of the space is for people to eat in it. If you have a problem with eating noises, *maybe* an eating space isn\u2019t the logical place for you to spend extra time in, eh?\u201d\n\nKathy looked upset and some of the coworkers who heard got quiet for a bit before continuing their conversations. She\u2019s been in sulky mood since.\n\nI think Kathy can block out eating noises when she\u2019s distracted by her own meal, but since it takes me longer to eat, my noises become the only eating noises for a while.\n\nI empathize that Kathy probably feels like she can\u2019t catch a break all day at work. Also  I want to acknowledge that there\u2019s a benefit to eating with others at work \u2014 it\u2019s a time to bond and network. So in removing herself, she\u2019d miss out a bit.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted because I likely *could* figure out another lunch to pack that\u2019s quieter and/or faster to eat. I know that she can\u2019t help how she feels. But I also don\u2019t appreciate her attitude and honestly, I like the lunches I pack since they make me feel satisfied and energized. They don\u2019t make me feel bloated or sluggish after eating them like so many other things do. I also don\u2019t want to remove myself and miss out on time with my coworkers because they\u2019re fun people.", "created_utc": 1681909431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rslt0/aita_for_eating_salad/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There has to be a way for her to manage this other than expecting everyone around her to not eat crunchy food.", "NTA. A lot of people are bothered by the eating noises of other people. You are 100% correct that usually when someone is eating themselves they are not bothered by other people eating. The main problem here is that Kathy is trying to control other\u2019s behavior, when she needs to control her own. If she is bothered by the noises it is not okay for her to make rude comments to other people who are just trying to eat their lunch. She needs to leave the room or find another alternative like headphones so that she is not taking out her issues on other people.", "NTA.

You were correct: for someone who has misophonia this severely, sitting in a dining area isn\u2019t the best choice. Other people shouldn\u2019t need to stop eating or have commentary about what they\u2019re eating just because she has this issue. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is going out of their way to eat in a disgusting manner either. Chewing ice, crunching chips, and eating salad is just how you consume those foods. Is everyone supposed to eating pudding so she can sit in the lunchroom? Your response was fair and polite imo. She likely realized you were right and is pouting.", "NTA this is why reasonable accommodations exist. Kathy needs to work with HR to determine reasonable accommodations for herself.
