The night before my 15th birthday, I made it clear that I didn\u2019t want my sister\u2019s boyfriend to be at the celebratory dinner because he has repeatedly caused arguments between siblings and in the past, eaten snacks that I paid for myself with my allowance and unnecessarily involved himself in my business. When I stated this, my sister got angry and said \u2018He\u2019s my boyfriend and you\u2019re being petty, you\u2019d think because you\u2019re older that you\u2019d let things go but clearly not. I don\u2019t know why we are celebrating a brat like you.\u2019 In response, I brought up everything he had done to me prior and pointed out that he already gets enough food from me and said \u2018He steals the snacks I paid for so he can survive not going to my dinner.\u2019 Because of this, my sister called me \u2018fat\u2019 and \u2018greedy\u2019. None of my parents defended me so I spent my birthday with Grandparents the day after. On the day of the dinner, I was pressured by my Mum into letting sister\u2019s boyfriend go, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t either. On my Sweet Sixteenth last year, we visited relatives for a festival because coincidentally, it fell on the same time as my birthday this year. We went to the festival on Saturday and when we got home, I baked my own cake with cousin and auntie because my sisters and mother didn\u2019t want to make it. The next day, my mother woke me up and said \u2018The girls want trifle, can I take a layer and some of the icing from your cake to make it?\u2019 I said \u2018No, it\u2019s my birthday cake and you know how much I hate trifle, if you really want a trifle, can\u2019t you just buy one or get the ingredients for one?\u2019 My mother responded with \u2018Okay. I went into town with my cousin for two hours and when I returned, I found she completely disregarded my wishes and took the cake to make her trifle anyway. Obviously, I got angry and didn\u2019t speak to her for the rest of the day because she put her needs and my sisters before me on the one day that is about me. She called me \u2018selfish\u2019 and \u2018spoiled\u2019. I am on good terms with them now but I worry they will make my seventeenth about them again so I don\u2019t want to risk it.

You should be proud of yourself for enforcing boundaries at a young age. Take it from an old old lady like me, being there bigger person just gives you the bigger ulcer.

There is scapegoating happening in your house and your mother is participating in it if not orchestrating it. You should try to start seeing a therapist because the earlier you develop the tools to see things the way they are and not internalize them, the happier you're going to be in life. If they do something selfish and disruptive on your birthday again, quietly remind your mother that this is how you're going to remember her when your older.", "NTA \n\nYou are the scapegoat.

I don't know about anyone else, but the whole make a big deal sweet 16 thing is something that I always associated with girls, and the fact that the OP seems to put an emphasis on that birthday in what was written, seems to suggest that it was something that was learned from the family. \n\nIn my family it was definitely a \"oh that's something that the girls make a fuss about, just play along to humour them\". Then again, in my family anyone above the age of toddler, who even THOUGHT about scavenging from someone else's birthday cake before they had a chance to take a bite would have been lit into, and put in the dog house. Straight up FAFO territory."]}
