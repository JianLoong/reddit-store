When I stated this, my sister got angry and said \u2018He\u2019s my boyfriend and you\u2019re being petty, you\u2019d think because you\u2019re older that you\u2019d let things go but clearly not.

None of my parents defended me so I spent my birthday with Grandparents the day after.

I don't know about anyone else, but the whole make a big deal sweet 16 thing is something that I always associated with girls, and the fact that the OP seems to put an emphasis on that birthday in what was written, seems to suggest that it was something that was learned from the family. \n\nIn my family it was definitely a \"oh that's something that the girls make a fuss about, just play along to humour them\".
