Do this at your own pace.  Changing eating habits first will make a big difference, then add on exercise.  You got this \ud83d\udc4d", "INFO: You're six feet, your mom is five feet. By your own acknowledgement, you're also a big guy. How, exactly, is your mom going to drag you anywhere? I'm not trying to minimize your upset, at all, but it's giving me a giggle picturing your mom trying to forcibly drag you into the doctor's office. :)", "NTA\n\nHonestly, there's not much your mother can do in the way of an ultimatum except kick you out of her house (assuming you're not on a lease or paying rent).  She can make an appointment for you, but she can't force you to go.  And even if you do go, a doctor can't force you to have surgery, take medication, or even stick to a diet.  In fact, most reputable weight-loss surgeons won't perform a lap-band or gastric bypass procedure unless you lose a certain amount of weight prior to the surgery to prove that you can adhere to the multiple restrictions that will be required for the rest of your life post-surgery.\n\nOn another note, I'd advise you to start taking steps to be healthier now that you're still young.  I neglected my health for years and it all caught up with me in my 40s.  I now have to take multiple supplements and medications and carefully watch my diet due to several serious chronic health conditions that were caused by long-term bad health habits.  Even small steps will help.  Also, you don't necessarily need to focus on weight loss.  Just try to make healthier food choices and get some physical activity every day.", "NTA. Forcing \"help\" on someone is not help. \n\nIt was an empty threat, though. She can't force surgery on you.\n\nI suppose she could kick you out of the house. I don't see what it would accomplish, though.", "NTA. She can threaten all she wants but absolutely zero physicians will force you to any kind of treatment or surgery for obesity. Zero. Surgery doesn\u2019t happen without many appointments with physicians, nutritionists, and therapists. You don\u2019t just walk in and get scheduled for surgery.", "NTA. So, where has she been for 20 years? Was she the one who provided healthy food, and showed you how to have a healthy relationship with food and your body? She could have gotten you therapy for anxiety years ago. YET. You are now an adult. If she can pay for therapy (eating for stress can be as harmful as any addiction), great! You are better off than many in having help. Find a lifestyle eating app, walk, hydrate, sleep. Lower your class load for awhile if you need to, getting healthy now will save you years of illness. Reddit is full of sites with kind people, you can learn much. \u270c", "Well, fortunately even if she managed to drag you to a doctor, they wouldn\u2019t offer you much because once you say no, I do not want to see this doctor, and since you actually are a grown adult, they will say okay, have a good day.   I understand you mother is worried about you and wants you healthy.  You probably understand that too.   Unfortunately she has probably bullied you your entire life and everything has been her way or the highway.  IF you want to make some changes, maybe find someone to work with.  Change can happen one teeny tiny step at a time.  To one person that tiny step may be stupid/worthless/whatever, but to you it could the the first tiny step toward greatness.\n\nSchool is hard, working two jobs is hard, life is hard.   Good luck to you !", "You are very much NTA. I'm guessing this isn't the first time she's made a comment like this and it's clear she has no understanding where the line is. \n\nHad you actually threatened her or said anything inappropriate I'd feel different, but your reaction to her was much more mature than I'd expect from someone your (or any) age and impressively measured and reasonable. It's not clear to me if you live with her-- I couldn't tell if you were just in her house to talk or if you live with her; if you do live with her it would be worth looking into moving out and limiting contact because I'm guessing a lot of your stress is coming from her shitty behaviour. \n\nAlso, no doctor will operate on you without your consent and if she does somehow force you to see a doctor they can serve as an ally for you to explain to her how out of line she is. No matter what she tells you, she does not have any right or ability to force you to get surgery, the fact that she thinks she does is frankly kind of batshit.", "NTA - Well done.", "ESH. You've already gotten a couple of N T A votes, because your mom is clearly out of line here. Agree, she is. You're absolutely right to draw a line.\n\nBut it sounds like, intentionally or unintentionally, you also resorted to physical intimidation. I have the impression that you are aware that you can be physically intimidating, and that even if you did not intend to frighten or threaten your mother, you did intend to use your size to drive home your point: she can't force you to do anything because you're bigger, and you'd handily win any fight.\n\nPhysical intimidation is not cool, and I don't think you can plead ignorance. ESH.", "NTA", "ESH. \n\nYour Mum just sounds really worried and is handling it poorly. I agree threatening your autonomy is a crappy move.\n\nYou seem to have little empathy for her worry.", "NTA only because you can't force someone to improve their health.\n\nBut your autonomy would be more meaningful if you were actually responsible for yourself, rather than living off her.", "NTA\u2026. But as a mother I sense her love and concern for you.  Obviously she cannot forcefully drag you anywhere so she is using her words to express to you her depth of concern and love.", "Your mom is right man. From what you wrote, this doesn't stem from some sort of  \"If you're fat girls won't want you\" vicarious living situation. Bodily autonomy is fine. All for it, but when you use that autonomy to destroy your body, there's a problem and I'm glad she's trying to get you help and find a better way for you to cope with the stresses of life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I stuck with it and worked my way up to an hour and started using free weights.  \n\nYa know, that person who saw me last only 3 minutes?  I have no idea who that was and would not recognize them today.  To Hell with them!\n\nIf I can do it... you can too!  Hang tough!", "She won't.

That's your right.\n\nMaybe you could excuse her some. She's paying for you to have a home, and maybe more.\n\nYou could exert some self control. You could be open and say what's she's saying hurts your feelings. You could be open to what she's saying - however poorly - and consider she might have a point, even though terribly delivered."]}
