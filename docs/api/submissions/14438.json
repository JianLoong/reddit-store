At no point did you \"hold this person accountable.\" Accountability doesn't really mean \"use social media to make someone's life miserable.\" That's Twitter bs. It means contact animal control about the dangerous animals, which would have *actually* done something to protect the public.", "YTA.... it's called doxxing and it's illegal.  You can warn people of the area but you can't single out a house.", "YTA. It seems as if you haven\u2019t contacted the authorities because public safety isn\u2019t your concern- public shaming is. Which makes it harassment.", "INFO How exactly were you \"attacked?\" It sounds like you were just followed and barked at a few feet into the street.", "YTA the appropriate way to deal with them being held accountable would be to report it to police/animal control rather than make their house a target and endanger their safety. \n\nIf you wanted to make sure people were careful while that was sorted out post the block of the street not peoples specific address. Regardless of your intention that information being public doesn\u2019t cause people to stay away but as is seen in this case actually be targets of crimes. \n\nAnd because it led to harassment it can be charged as doxxing even if publicly available information.", "YTA.  While the dog owners were very irresponsible this isn\u2019t the right course of action. You should have gone to the police or spoke to the owners yourself. Your actions may have been (morally) justified if they\u2019d ignored previous attempts to sort this out.", "You should have spoken to the owner and/or reported it to the police. It's not helpful to go straight to social media as it only reaches a limited audience, and fuels gossip and direct action from anyone with with a vigilante mentality.", "YTA.", "YTA. You call the police in situations like this. Like it or not, as a result of your post, they are now being harassed. So take it down and contact the police about the dogs.", "YTA call the police or animal control. You most definitely could of warned people on Facebook without putting the whole address up especially once they have told you they have kids!", "nta\n\nreport these dogs to who ever you need to the fact they have children around them is concerning.\n\ntake down the post with there information and report to the relevant people", "NTA don't they have pit bulls to protect them? Boo hoo. \n\nIt's not a problem for them when someone else is in danger of being mauled by their dogs in public (middle of the street is public, why are the dogs there?) so why should they be given \"privacy.

OP didn\u2019t help anyone who doesn\u2019t use Facebook, or who isn\u2019t a part of that FB group, or even just happened to not see that specific post.

And where it is illegal, it almost always requires a malicious intent to harass. A legitimate safety warning probably does not meet that requirement. There are other exceptions as well. If OP reported the incident to the police and a journalist reported the address and owners name, it would not be doxxing. \n\nThe message urges people to avoid the area, not hurt the family.

I didn't give names or phone numbers.", "No that's not harassment lol", "Is doxxing even illegal?", "Thank you! It appears the majority of people believe doxxing is illegal no matter the circumstances, based on the downvotes I'm receiving.", "You gave out their address with the information of their animals, which are a breed that the general public has an issue with. That's enough for some people to go and do targeted crime, which is exactly what happened.\n\nAddresses are public, but if you posted someone else's address online, you can still get in trouble for it.", "Yes it is illegal and can be prosecuted. It falls under cyber harassment. \n\nBut also even if it wasn\u2019t, is putting kids at risk because of their parents decisions okay with you?", "Whether this is illegal or not please just call police or animal control to get a report done properly. If they do bite someone the others can sue properly as well. Fb is fine to notify people but a lot of people don\u2019t use fb and and such.", "Posting a geographical location where there's a clear and present danger is illegal?

The correct thing to do is notify the city of off leash animals, and if you desperately feel the need to warn the community, then post a general area where the dogs are. \n\nYour post has encouraged people to hurt the people living at that address. That's the illegal part.", "Conveniently didn\u2019t answer how you felt - as a human being not how the law can be interpreted- about putting their kids at risk", "I never specifically encouraged anyone to cause harm. There was no malicious intent, therefore it's not illegal.", "Do you even know what country OP is in to call it illegal?"]}
