This is important and under most circumstances its obvious that I should be making these accommodations for her, but this has been the norm long before she became pregnant.\n\nMy wife of 3 years asks for a massage every night before going to bed. It may start as a foot massage, an ankle massage, or a back massage, but it almost always ends up being a request for her whole body until she falls asleep. There are times when I'm fully willing and able to give her the half hour massage she wants, but more often than not I'm tired too or my hands, wrists and shoulders ache from working. I still always end up giving her one when she asks, but only because I know there will first be guilt tripping, and then the cold shouldered if I don't. I really don't feel like doing this every night, but she has made it rather obvious that she sees a refusal as neglectful behavior.\n\nTo clarify, I usually don't like to toot my own horn but by God I am the furthest thing from a neglectful husband. We didn't decorate for Christmas this year because I had the living room ceiling opened up roughing in a new master bathroom upstairs. I had finished closing up the holes and repainting the ceiling, and last night while she was asleep I put up a tree, decorated it, put the presents we had gotten from her family under it and put out several other decorations in the living room so that she could still have a Christmas morning of sorts. Then today after work I drove her around a very wealthy town nearby us to look at the Christmas lights. So again, I do not neglect her. I love to do things to make her happy.\n\nBut because I didn't massage her feet and calves as long as she would have liked tonight, I still got a flat and monotone \"goodnight\" with a side of not even bothering to turn her head to look at me.\n\nIf I sound resentful over it I apologize, but I definitely have some strong feelings attached to it. The resentment probably comes from the fact that despite doing this with her literally all the time, we have a dead bedroom and have been in a mostly sexless marriage from the beginning. Our average time between sex is 3-4 months since she's 'just never in the mood'. Most recently of course it's been over 6 months, and likely to be over a year before we do again. To reiterate, this has been going on long before her pregnancy so while it's a factor now, it wasn't always.\n\nI would feel as though I'd earned some sort of reciprocity on intimacy, except that I'm not going to enjoy sex unless she is, and isnt reminding me that she's doing me a favor. I like her to be happy, my goal in sex since we were dating was always to identify what gets her off and focus on that.\n\nBut this is becoming a rant. Am I am asshole for not wanting to give every night when it's a one way street like this?\n\n  \nedit: apparently I'm not allowed to comment on my own post because I don't have 100 comment karma with this sub or something like that. so I'll answer a question I've seen come up a few times here: \n\n  \nyes, it's definitely my kid. For starters she didn't have the time to cheat because she almost never left the house except for work and when she did she was at her parents house less than two miles away. As well the timeline lines up with when we last did. this leads me into answering another question, that sex did pick up leading up to her getting pregnant. It was twice a month, on the two days she suspected she was ovulating. when the positive test came up the sex planned for the next month was cancelled.", "created_utc": 1703649017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rr0dq/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_wife_a_massage/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As well, the fact that she's upset in and of itself tells me she feels like she's been wronged by me, and that is enough for me to feel like I should get an opinion from outside of my biased position. Her being upset means I've done something wrong, it always has.

Not unusual - but 6 months befooooore getting pregnant is a bigger issue and that definitely was something that should have been and hopefully will be addressed.  \n\n\nBut no, NTA for not wanting to give a massage every. single. night.  not at all.", "At the risk of being downvoted to oblivion, ESH. \n\nI\u2019m making a huge assumption here, based on the fact that you don\u2019t mention addressing this with her directly so\u2026 *Communicate with your wife.* You guys are adults, you are having a baby, how are you not discussing your currently incompatible intimacy needs and how that is impacting you as individuals and your relationship?! \n\nYou\u2019re about to parent together, you\u2019re dialling that all the way up to hard mode if you can\u2019t get on the same page with open and honest communication. Get into counselling now before a teacup human being arrives to complicate everything and your dysfunctional dynamic with your wife becomes far worse than it is now. \n\n(And of course, what your wife is doing is 10/10 bullshit behaviour with the icy reception to you not wanting to give her the physical intimacy that *she* likes, but again\u2026 Y\u2019all really REALLY gotta actually talk about this)", "NTA- except maybe for being a huge doormat.  \n\nI\u2019m curious- did you feel like your wife was out of your league when you first got together? Because it sounds like you\u2019re still striving to win her over, and she\u2019s using you without putting much reciprocal effort into the marriage.", "NTA", "NTA\nIt must be tiring for you. \nShe should know that normal massage is not good for pregnant women and she should go to a professional. Increased blood flow after massage could cause miscarriage.", "DBTA, give her the messages. Alternatively you could carry the baby... oh yeah... anyway... so just give her the massage.", "I think I\u2019d be accusing her of getting her own physical needs met every night while ignoring mine and that\u2019s not gonna work long term. Why you impregnated someone or who isn\u2019t interested in intimacy is your business - now you\u2019re kind of stuck with the marriage unless you\u2019re planning to walk out on a pregnant woman so I would try to make the best of it -while making it plain that intimacy is a two way street.  Maybe not after the second trimester as much but you\u2019re certainly not the A for not providing nightly massages or expecting reciprocal affectionate touching.", "NTA but I cannot imagine this behavior only starting after you got married. This seems like something that would come up pretty early on in a relationship when it comes to expectations.", "Nta. Dude you shouldve stopped this long ago if she doesnt reciprocate the favor. No one is owed a massage every night", "You end sex with your wife by feeding her one food...wedding cake", " Have you sat her down and had a conversation with her? Worked out a compromise? Tell her that it\u2019s hurtful to you when she responds this way when you are doing your best and also get tired and sore?", "NTA. When my ex wife was pregnant, she decided that I should spread the stretch mark cream on her belly every night. Ok, fine, I was all about it. Until the times she would be in a shit mood and berate me half the night. Ok, hormones, I know! I would still get her anything she needed, but I didn't exactly feel like having close moments like that 10 minutes after she was yelling at me. So I would tell her she could rub it on herself. And OMFG! Every time I said that, it was like I was ripping the baby right out of her and I didn't love either one of them! Still. When I didn't feel like I could be close to her like that, I didn't try faking it. I just said NO and dealt with what came with that. No idea which option will be harder for you OP. But only one will leave you with some goddam dignity.", "NTA. The cold shoulder after you tell her you\u2019re tired is super manipulative. Every night is too damn much.", "I been pregnant with twins and I didn\u2019t request a massage everyday. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. Just buy her a massage by a professional. Get her into a chiropractor.", "NTA - it\u2019s an unreasonable request you\u2019ve unfortunately set a precedent on that makes her feel like she can pout about it not happening. She probably uses this as all she needs physically while your physical needs are ignored. \n\nI think you two need couples counseling desperately. Things will only get harder to maintain connection after a first child is born and you should not have to give a massage every night to maintain that bare minimum of a one-sided affection.", "NTA. Currently 9 weeks pregnant, and through both of my pregnancies my husband has done so much for me - I would NEVER ask him to do that every day!\n\nThe sex thing dropping off is weirdish to me too. Granted everyone is different - but we tend to have more sex when I'm pregnant (when I'm not on pelvic rest, and even then we do non penetrative things!). We literally had sex the day I got the positive pregnancy test this time because we were so happy and excited. I get not being up for sex (nausea and exhaustion are real, bruh), but cancelling the little \"planned\" sex there already is? That's a bummer.\n\nYour wife is using you. She seems to have used you to get pregnant (rather than it being a true journey together), and is abusing your generosity and her condition. Should pregnant women receive extra care and consideration from their partners? 100% - pregnancy is hard, emotionally and physically. But that's not what this is, OP. I don't really have advice though since it doesn't seem to be a new hormonal thing, but a longer term personality issue.", "[deleted]", "Info:\n\nIf you have sex so infrequently, how is she pregnant?", "NTA. \n\nShe is asking for something unreasonable from a partner, especially when she gives nothing back *and* gets angry at you if you refuse to take part in her demand.", "Fuck. Is this post me from 3 years ago?\nIt doesn't get better. \n\nI was fixing the laundry room today. \"Why can't you do this THING now?\" \n\nShe makes way too many pare ting decisions on her own. Then throws it in my face that I wasn't involved. It annoys me so much that I keep a list. \n\nNTA. Sorry dude. Is it worth staying in this marriage?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Otherwise, your marriage won\u2019t stand a chance. You are already resenting it (I don\u2019t blame you), and it will just drive you apart.

My husband would give me a foot massage every day during pregnancy but he wasn\u2019t working at the time like he does now so he was fine doing it as he wasn\u2019t exhausted.

If it does, then you have a major problem on your hands. It sounds like she knows she can get anything she wants from you with a sniff and a head turn, which means she doesn't view you as an equal. This doesn't bode well for making decisions together about the baby. \n\nIf you stop for a few days and she claims you're being neglectful, offer to go to couples counseling with her.
