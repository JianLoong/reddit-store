We both have very large families, but hers is really poor and kind of traditional. As a result my fianc\u00e9 has been taught to always go for the cheapest option throughout her life, whether we are going out to eat or buying clothes or going on holiday. Well, we've been planning the wedding, and the choice of venue was typical for her - a small local church where she was christened. Right off the bat, the place isn't suitable for the number of guests who will be invited, and I knew she only chose that location because of money, which is not an issue.\n\nI spoke to my father, and he agreed to fund a wedding abroad in Venice (I'm their only child so getting married is a big deal) and to arrange transportation for all the guests. He agreed to cover all expenses. So obviously I changed the venue and sent out invitations. I knew the money spent would make her anxious and she has always dreamed of visiting Venice so I waited to tell her until it was organised as a surprise. \n\nWell, she didn't take it well and said I was a massive asshole and that she had much preferred the church venue. She said it was too embarrassing to cancel it now that I've told people but seems really mad. I'm confused since that venue was never practical and am wondering if I'm the asshole here or if she's overreacting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694699264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16iiz2h/aita_for_changing_the_wedding_venue_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 918, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Picked a venue. Picked a different COUNTRY. Scheduled for a date. Made the guest list. Chose the invitations. \n\n\nMaybe she chose the church because of personal meaning, maybe she chose it because it was cheaper. The wedding should be planned by both of you....which means, if you didn't like the venue, it's fine to say no. Try to find a venue you are both okay with...something bigger, more options, but still relatively local.\n\n\n Did you even confirm that her closest family would be able to make it? Even if your dad pays for all travel expenses....not everyone can afford to take off work, or can travel that far. \n\n\nHow soon is it? Are you in the EU? If her family is not well off, and you live in the US, a lot of them probably don't even have passports. \n\n\nAlso, if she really wants to go to Venice, there's probably a lot of things she wants to do there that would be a lot harder around a wedding. She'd probably enjoy it a lot more as a honeymoon. \n\n\nAnd if you have such vastly differing opinions about money, there are major conversations you need to have in general before marriage (which hopefully doesn't happen because she deserves someone who respects her). Do you live together? How are bills paid?", "YTA\n\nA marriage is supposed to be a *partnership*. You operated completely behind her back, then revealed it once it was a *fait accompli*. How can you be confused about her reaction?\n\nYou think you sent the message \"he's willing to get his parents to do extravagant things for us\" or if you didn't tell her it's daddy's money, \"he's willing to spend so much to give me nice things!\"\n\nThe message you actually sent is \"he does not give one benighted fuck about my feelings and desires. He's always going to make huge decisions behind my back.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n You'll be lucky if she doesn't call it off.", "YTA. Why would you change not only the venue but the location of the wedding without talking it over with the person you are marrying? Why is Venice a better choice than the church she has an emotional connection with better? Would your partner have liked a destination wedding in a place other than Venice better? Why do you and your father get to make these decisions for her without even involving her?", "YTA. \n\nGoing behind your partners back to change a huge aspect of something they\u2019re planning seems to be the absolute worst way to start a marriage. \n\nNext time communicate, you know, like a normal husband would.", "Dude her family may not even have passports to leave the country.. international travel isn\u2019t a norm for working class families. You didn\u2019t change the venue, you completely uprooted what was a beautiful commitment ceremony and made it a lavish party *for you*. YTA", "YTA...So much so that it's astounding it's not obvious to you.  Her choice wasn't about money, but about a sentimental attachment to the venue.

Also, the emotional value of the church that she was christened is probably more important to her than it being flashy.", "YTA\n\nDid it ever occur to you that your wife choosing the same church she got christen in to get married in might have had more to do with sentimental value and emotional connection to the location as opposed to the cost. You seem like you have no interest in marrying your wife and just having a party to impress people that Daddy has money and will spend it on his special boy", "YTA\n\nYou are about to start a relationship and instead of acting like a partner, you made a unilateral decision, which goes against the nature of who your fiancee is.\n\nGuaranteed, she is going to have relatives who won't feel comfortable taking what they see as a handout and showing off wealth difference.\n\nDude... seriously.", "YTA- the wedding isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about BOTH of you TOGETHER, meaning that all decisions need to be made TOGETHER. \n\nThis was a really shitty thing to do, you don\u2019t just completely change the entire plan of a wedding like that without telling the fucking bride. Of course guests are confused, that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous of you to do and if it were me, I would be leaving you over this. Major breach of trust and communication.", "YTA.\nIf her family are poor, how will they be able to afford to travel and pay hotels etc? \nYou should have stuck to the original wedding plans and went on honeymoon to Venice.", "YTA - that church has sentimental value to her and her family and that is clearly why she chose it. You could\u2019ve just narrowed the guest list down for the ceremony in the church itself and invited more people to the reception/after party. Instead you\u2019ve gone way out of line and organised something completely different that your future wife clearly doesn\u2019t want, without even running it by her. You\u2019ve been entirely led by what other people will think of your wedding, making you sound shallow and thoughtless. Great qualities in a husband\u2026", "YTA this is definitely something that should have been discussed.  You didn\u2019t just change the venue you hijacked the wedding.\n\nShe may have chosen the church because it has sentimental value as that\u2019s where she was christened.  Or it could have been about price.\n\nYou should have still discussed a different venue before hijacking the entire wedding and changing the whole aspect of it.", "YTA. \n\nThat should have been a conversation WITH HER.", "YTA. A successful marriage is all about communication and compromise. It's one thing to surprise your partner with a gift or a nice dinner out. It's a completely different thing to rearrange the wedding to suit your wants and needs without any discussion of the event.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been a very nice gesture if you had talked about it with her. And even if you would have decided to keep the small church venue after all, you fiancee would have appreciate your idea.\n\nPlease talk together when you make plans, not everybody like surprises, even nice thoughtful ones.", "Yta. Abroad weddings are so much more complicated than just money. People need to take longer off work which might not be allowed - they might not have the annual leave for it and so won't be paid. Is Daddy paying for that? People might not have passports and so can't actually travel. Is Daddy paying for that? What language is the ceremony in? The extra costs of travelling, like paying for extra meals or the fact that everyone else is going out. Is Daddy paying for that? \n\nWhy on earth would you not just talk to your fiance, like this would be a massive deal breaker for me. \n\nYou could've just gone on honeymoon to Venice.", "YTA although I see you are trying to be generous... it's a day thats important to her and you should have included her on such a serious decision. Others may still not be able to attend even if the base costs were covered.", "YTA. \n\nSHould have sat down and discussed it with her, instead of immediately deciding to do a destination wedding.", "YTA, always discuss with your fianc\u00e9 about everything wedding related. You say you know she only chose the church because it was cheap but she was also christened there so it could mean a lot more than what you think it really does. Also, I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located and Venice could be a 2 day trip which means family members have to request 2 days off that they may not have despite travel being paid for. Personally, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s mad that you chose Venice, I think she\u2019s just upset that you did it without discussing it with her", "YTA\nYou may not be getting married, dude. You completely ignored and invalidated the bride's thoughts, feelings and priorities about her wedding day. You decided money rules and you've got money. So why even tell your poor little fianc\u00e8e about the \"much better\" wedding you planned entirely without her? You sent invitations to create social pressure to make her agree to the wedding she didn't want and had no hand in planning. She may realize how manipulative and dismissive of her you are.\n\nAn unwanted gift is a classic manipulation/power struggle..The \"gift' imposes an unwanted obligation on the recipient, who is pressured to violate their own boundaries and comfort because \"it cost so much\" or \"they meant well.\" That's exactly what you've done to your fianc\u00e8e.", "YTA. Unilateral decision-making does not make for a strong marriage. Also, you come off as a little bit classist in this post.", "YTA - offering Venice would be an awesome thing to do but not without consulting her.

If my husband had done this, I would be seriously reconsidering the wedding.", "YTA. Marriage is a partnership, you should have spoken with her about a possible change to a destination wedding first. As others have said, she might have a sentimental attachment to the church and has always wanted to be married there. Someone else mentioned passports\u2014her family might now have them. Another issue is time. If her family is working class and/or poor then they might have limited vacation time. A local, or fairly local, wedding might not be an issue but needing more days off for international travel could be. It kind of also comes off as you flashing your wealth and looks like you\u2019re saying you can do more for her than they can.

We both have very large families, but hers is really poor and kind of traditional. As a result my fianc\u00e9 has been taught to always go for the cheapest option throughout her life, whether we are going out to eat or buying clothes or going on holiday. Well, we've been planning the wedding, and the choice of venue was typical for her - a small local church where she was christened. Right off the bat, the place isn't suitable for the number of guests who will be invited, and I knew she only chose that location because of money, which is not an issue.\n\nI spoke to my father, and he agreed to fund a wedding abroad in Venice (I'm their only child so getting married is a big deal) and to arrange transportation for all the guests. He agreed to cover all expenses. So obviously I changed the venue and sent out invitations. I knew the money spent would make her anxious and she has always dreamed of visiting Venice so I waited to tell her until it was organised as a surprise. \n\nWell, she didn't take it well and said I was a massive asshole and that she had much preferred the church venue. She said it was too embarrassing to cancel it now that I've told people but seems really mad. I'm confused since that venue was never practical and am wondering if I'm the asshole here or if she's overreacting.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nGiven that the church is where she was christened, it is likely it has sentimental value to her. Also, expensive doesn't always mean better. She chose the church as a venue, and you completely disregarded her choice.", "Massive YTA - I mean really?  You haven't a clue why YTA?  Here is a woman who is to become your wife, your life partner in a union of marriage and you didn't even stop to think a second  to maybe check with her on such a monumental decision that involved your marriage?  I don't have any advice for you, you are too dense and self-centered.  For your future wife I would say don't marry this smuck.", "YTA this is definitely something you should have discussed with her. The venue is often a very important choice for the wedding and if your wife was christened at that church, I suspect her choosing it had more to do with sentimental reasons than cost. I know you think this was a fantastic surprise because it's just so over the top... but it doesn't sound like what she wants at all. And dude, some people just hate surprises in general. So if you do surprise someone, make it small things like flowers, a nice restaurant, some jewelry, or even a weekend get away. You do not surprise someone with anything of this caliber that affects not just her, but everyone on her guest list. If her family is so poor, this may cause a lot of problems for them on a larger scale than just the plane ticket and accommodations. They will likely have to take a lot more time off work for this overseas event, which will likely effect their income  for the month and could effect their job security. You dropped a bomb of a surprise on her, and it doesn't sound like a good idea at all. You should have discussed it with her, and if she still wants your wedding in that little chapel, then you should respect that decision. Your venue is just too extreme of a change and majorly effects every single guest.", "YTA. I'd be cancelling the wedding and it'd take an awful lot to persuade me not to cancel the relationship.  Sounds like that church holds great sentimental value to her too.", "YTA\n\nWeddings and wedding planning is not typically a good place for surprise changes.\n\nAnd that big of a change might keep her family from being able to attend.", "You...changed the venue to a place abroad where all her guests will have to fly and take time off work...without telling her? And think because your dad is paying for everyone there is no issue? Am I reading that correctly?\n\nVerdict pending until I understand WTH is actually going on here.", "YTA\nIt's a nice touch,  if you're into destination weddings. But is she? Really? Did you check?\nThe right way to go would've been to test the waters, or even have hypothetical talks of 'what if you could get married anywhere, and money was not an issue?\nMaybe she wanted to make the traditional drive from her parents house to the church. (Don't know if that's local to here, but whatever.)", "YTA I was expecting you upgraded to a bigger space in the same town.  You changed it to a destination wedding, which is so expensive for everyone else and requires travel not everyone can do, and sent invitations without even talking to her.  \n\nThis is a massive red flag for how you will make decisions in the future.", "The church she was Christened - began her life as a Christian... and the church she wanted to begin her life as your wife.\n\nNot everything is about money, dude.\n\nYTA", "Wow.... why are you getting married if you didn't include your future spouse or even talk to her about the changes?  This wasn't a surprise. This was just taking complete control over what is supposed to be one of the most significant days in BOTH of your lives.

Your marriage will not last.", "YTA this is supposed to be something you plan together and changing the wedding abroad means that most or all of her lower-income family probably won't be able to afford to go. Also maybe the  church where she was christened holds some significance for her family??", "YTA. In most western cultures this is the bride's show to manage.

You thought of no one other than yourself. Of course she's angry.", "YTA- \n\nYou could so easily have had the ceremony in the church that means a lot to her and then a larger, more extravagant reception at a venue that meets your more expensive tastes. You could have surprised her with a honeymoon in Venice. \n\nInstead,  you just ignored her charming and sentimental desire to be married where she was christened and decided that it would be ok to make people travel (on short notice) . You assumed that everyone could just take time away from work,  arrange care for children,  pets, and/or aged relatives to hop on a plane to attend. Hell, you even assumed that everyone has a current passport. \n\nI would call off the wedding altogether over this.", "Your attitude is exactly why the world hates millionaires and billionaires. Let's just throw some money at it, that'll help! /s\n\nIf I were your fianc\u00e9e, this would be grounds for cancelling the wedding if not breaking it off entirely. She clearly picked a venue that was close to her, meant something to her. Sentiment is clearly not a language you understand. On top of that, a marriage is a PARTNERSHIP! You make decisions together. If you truly wanted to surprise her, you'd have planned a honeymoon in Venice, not the wedding. Get your head out of your ass, apologize now, and do what you can to fix it. YTA", "If the wedding is next month then invitations were already sent.  You say her family isn't wealthy like yours so how are they supposed to get the extra time off work with such short notice or arrange childcare?  She will always be forced to look back on her wedding day with great sadness and disappointment at the missing family at friends that you forced out of the wedding.", "YTA. Where you get married should be a decision made by both partners.", "YTA. Big time. \n\nTo be clear, you upended the entirety of the wedding plans without consulting your soon-to-be (maybe) wife? You asked Daddy for money and made unilateral decisions about how your marriage is going to kick off. Did you EVER consider how this would impact her, and her family, and friends? If the church wasn't practical, why didn't you use your words and talk to the woman you supposedly love and come up with a solution? \n\nAre you ashamed of your wife and her upbringing and family?

She will likely go through with the wedding but get an annulment.", "I honestly hope she sees this for the huge red flag it is and delays the wedding.

No matter the intention.", "YTA-for the obvious reason that a wedding is between two people, and you made a big decision without her. You even said you *knew* it would make her nervous.\n\nMoreover, didn't think about her perspective at all. Even after discussing it with her, you didn't talk about her specific concerns. If she's just made because it's clear that her future spouse doesn't value her opinion on such a huge decision, thats valid. But there's a ton of other reasons that she might not want to have a destination wedding.\n\nYou say your dad will pay all of the travel expenses, but wealthy people tend to be much better positioned to just up and leave their lives for a few days, and it doesn't sound like you took that into account. Maybe people can't afford to or aren't able to get off work to travel. If someone has dependants that can't come with, it is going to be a bigger burden to find care for them than it would be for your family. Maybe she's being sensitive to her guest's feelings- would they all be comfortable accepting a lavish gift that they'll likely never be in a position to repay? Maybe the specific venue just genuinely has sentimental value to her. \n\nThe wedding is for both of you, and you should be able to talk and work out these issues. Its nuts that you think your father should have more say in your wedding than your bride.", "YTA", "YTA, massively. Way to start your marriage with massive resentment. Your fianc\u00e9e is going to HATE that wedding because she had no say in it and everything that she wanted was casually brushed aside by you and your daddy's money. Have you even ASKED HER if the church she picked held any importance to her? It's where she was christened and you are in Poland so I'll assume her family is at least somewhat religious - that place therefore holds emotional value to her and you just decided that nope, that wasn't at all important.\n\nFurthermore, you cancelled everything ELSE she might have had planned. And are now treating her family to what are essentially going to feel like pity handouts - oh oh, the rich lords treating the poor to a trip to Italy. :/\n\nThat is going to be one extremely expensive shitty wedding.\n\nCz\u0142owieku, serio.", "Lol dude, YTA. Why didn\u2019t you tell her? It\u2019s not your wedding, it\u2019s both of yours, she should have been consulted. \n\nDid you ever think maybe a big flashy wedding like that has no sense of connection and home for her? If she grew up poor, doing something out of her nature on her wedding day may not be her thing. \n\nDefinitely the asshole, and unfortunately she\u2019s right that at this point it\u2019s too late to change. Bad move to start your marriage off with, I\u2019d apologize ASAP and try to make this right.", "YTA. This isn't the kind of thing you surprise someone with after she has picked a location.", "YTA\n\n\u201cHer family is poor\u201d means they may not have the resources. People with money don\u2019t think about every little expense because it\u2019s not impactful to them. Travel and lodging and n everything is expensive when traveling. I mean dad would need to pay for transportation, lodging, food and give people cash for their random expenses to get and be there. I am sure it\u2019s not that way. \n\nSuper tone-deaf. \n\nI thought this would be like a bigger church or fancier estate or something which would still suck. Changing a simple wedding to a destination wedding is a huge decision.", "Ytav in a seriously major way. You made massive decisions about your shared wedding and doesn't discuss it with her. \n\nYou know there's a middle ground between the church and Venice, right?", "Yta a million ways.\nThe only way to save this is a huge apology and another wedding BEFORE you go to Venice for only \"intimate family\", which SHE chooses the guest list for. People who attend this must also be invited to the Venice event and paid for if they choose to attend. If her family is poor, they can't get the time, childcare, or passports to travel. This is so cruel and weird.", "Yta.\n\nFor real, who started the trend of surprise planning weddings without input from the bride? I honestly can't think of a more obviously boneheaded move.", "Yeh, definitely YTA.  The wedding is soon, so there is a pretty good chance that your fianc\u00e9 will go through with it.  I am guessing that you can get away with at most 2 more \"surprises\" like this (more likely just one) before you learn about the divorce process in the EU.", "YTA", "YTA. What makes you think that  her guests would be able to atend a wedding in Venice. While you should definitely have a say in where the wedding is heald, that doesn't give you the right to push for a venue and ignore the needs of your fianc\u00e9.", "Hmmm\u2026 I bet $1 that this marriage won\u2019t last long, YTA.", "YTA  \nYou werent going to surprise her, you chose to go behind her back.  \nI would propose you to take her on a honeymoon to Venice.  \nAlso, are you embarrased of her and her family?", "YTA\nShe wanted to get married where she was christened.", "YTA did you forget that it is also her wedding? She should maybe be informed of the venue change\u2026", "YTA. You don't plan a wedding with your father - you plan a wedding with your betrothed. \n\nYou also don't go behind your partner's back and take away all her agency because she gets anxious about money. Do you even care about her as a separate, autonomous person? \n\nLastly, when your partner gets upset at you, that's not overreacting.  You messed up badly and she's reacting in a completely reasonable way. I would have dumped you because this kind of behavior (*your* behavior) is a red flag.", "YTA. Not everyone wants a movie star wedding, some people want a wedding to reflect their values\u2026like getting married in the church one was baptized in, a deeply meaningful place for her and her family. I don\u2019t think you two are compatible at all. She\u2019s had no say in her own wedding and she\u2019ll feel like a guest at her own wedding instead of the bride. Big mistake.", "Her family is poor so you decided that they need to take a vacation to a different country? You realize that it's not about the travel money right? It's about them losing work money! Her family can't afford to lose a whole week worth of pay just because you want to get married in another country and flex your money!\n\nAre you planning on giving them all $500 so they can pay bills that they have to pay but now can't because they're not working those days? Or a thousand maybe? You didn't just pick a different venue! You didn't pick the church down the road that's twice the size or a better banquet hall. You picked a whole different country! You picked a vacation for everybody invited! That makes YTA", "Assuming since you mention Poland and church you are Catholics.\n\nOf course she wants to be married in her family parish church! It's where she was baptized as a baby. Where she received first communion as a young girl. Where she was confirmed as a teen. Where she knows the priest.\n\nMy read is that the issue isn't the church's size (even the smallest can usually handle several hundred people) but that it's a not fancy church in a not fancy neighborhood. So not fancy enough for OP 's snooty family that wants to flaunt their money.\n\nMaking and to have a different ceremony at a super expensive venue in a different country without even discussing it first? Of course she's upset, because she realizes her fianc\u00e9 is a total asshole.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nHow do you not talk this through beforehand? How?? This is beyond stupid. \n\nHave fun making up for this humongous breach of trust...", "YTA OP- honestly this breaks my heart for the bride to be. Imagine feeling like you have no say over your own wedding. She may have had dreams about her wedding and being able to plan it for years. She may have picked that church for other reasons than it being affordable. All you have done is show her what she wants or even her own opinions do not matter and you will just steam roll over them and not even tell her. Honestly if I was her I would use this giant red flag as a parachute and leave the relationship before getting married.", "YTA\n\nAre you marrying a partner, or hiring a slave? Because you just completely ignored her will in one of the biggest days of her life. \n\nI hope you like being single. Because if my husband had made unilateral decisions about something this big,  he'd never have become a husband.", "Personally I would be elated if my soon to be husband surprised me with a wedding in Venice that I didn\u2019t have to plan. But even so, YTA. You pulled the rug out from under her. And your guests. Chances are a lot of her family members can\u2019t just up and go to Venice for a few days. Us \u2018poor\u2019 people don\u2019t have that luxury.", "YTA\n\nLook, you can tell yourself and everybody else you did this for her and you maybe even believe this, but fact is you did this for you. \n\nYou wern't happy with the venue and the wedding you planned, so you went behind her back and changed it to something you knew she wouldn't agree. IF you had done this for her, you would have surprised her with the offer from your dad and discussed with her if you guys want to take the offer or not. But the fact you arranged everything behind her back and even sent out the invitation w/o her knowledge prooves you exactly knew she won't be happy with it. So the only person benefitting from all your changes is you. Not your wife, not the guests, you. You did this bc its what you want, period. \n\nAnyway, you will now start your marriage with an event that will forever be a representation of your selfishness. But i guess there is not much you can do about it now. I hope your wife is still able to at least enjoy the wedding a little bit, but i guess this will be a sore spot for a while.", "YTA obviously, but you don't really care what she thinks or how she feels since you can just decide how she feels for her and then make decisions accordingly. Does she even need to be there? I mean, she doesn't even know what she wants, wouldn't it be better if you just did the whole thing by yourself?", "YTA. A marriage is between 2 people. You may be better off marrying yourself though", "YTA! How is Vennice more practical than a simple Church wedding? It's more expensive to go to another city for a wedding. And you did this without her consent. I hope you're happy because your fiancee will clearly not marry you after this. Actually, be happy because you just saved yourself from an expensive divorce.", "YTA. You didn't just change venues, YOU CHANGED THE PLANS COMPLETELY.\n\nThis isn't some cute surprise, this is breakup worthy.", "YTA", "YTA. Did you ever think that she picked the church she was christened in because it was important to her and part of her family life? Your fianc\u00e9e might not just be picking the cheapest option to save money but because she doesn\u2019t like showy things. That church is likely the one she grew up going to and had gone to regularly and she is part of that church\u2019s community. To go behind her back and change it shows that you don\u2019t understand her at all.", "YTA. Did you miss the part about the original venue being where she had been christened? The emotional value of that place outweighs some flashy destination wedding to her, obviously. You should have talked to her about your concerns before changing anything!", "YTA. If i was her i would think about changing the fianc\u00e9. As a surprise.", "YTA \n\nWhy did you think this would go over well?\n\nChanging anything about a wedding as a \"surprise\" seems like a horrible idea.", "Wow. \n\nYta.", "Weddings involve two people. While I honestly believe you had the best intentions, it was totally an AH move to make without her input.\n\nAlso, having a wedding abroad means everyone has to scurry and get passports, which can be expensive and a drawn-out process.

You will have tough times (everyone does) but if you communicate constantly and well, you will be ok. You can get through most things by keeping talking.

It never occurred to you that maybe the church had sentimental value?  Or perhaps you needed to stop making assumptions and use your words to talk to her about your concerns about the venue?  You just unilaterally decided you knew better and did all this behind her back.

I'm pretty go with the flow and if I had a partner who felt strongly about a specific location I'd be totally on board, provided we had a conversation about it. \n\nHowever, if they hijacked the event and changed important details without telling me, I'd honestly think about ending things. Because if they're willing to do it for a wedding, they're going to be willing to do it for everything else in life. \n\nYTA and the fact you need reddit to tell you that is alarming. I don't think you're ready, or frankly responsible enough to get married.", "YTA. How do you know the cost was the reason she chose that venue?

You chose a venue in a different country from where you live without consideration for the fact that some of her relatives may not be able to afford to go! What the hell is wrong with you? \n\nA marriage is a partnership of two people who make decisions together. It isn't and should never be a relationship where one party bulldozes the other person and forces their will upon the other. This is what you've done. She is not at all overreacting. She's angry you made multiple decisions without her input. You don't seem to care about how this will affect her or her family. Given how you emphasized how poor her family is, it sounds like you don't even want them there. You say you arranged for transportation, but what if they can't take off from work? Did you even think about that? \n\nI hope she dumps you.", "Yeah dude\u2026YTA. Weddings are supposed to be bout the wants and needs of both people and you ignored hers.

She had no say so in this change, she didn't get to help choose or word invitations, did you also pick out her dress and flowers for her??\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 grew up poor and, like yours, often chooses the cheapest options. (For example, he literally teared up in the grocery store last week when i insisted he get the better quality steak.) This isn't a choice for them, it is ingrained in the person that they are...it isn't that she WANTS the lower quality, it's that she appreciates it for what it is and is happy to have it at all...it's a different mindset that is hard to understand if you grew up even middle class. That small local church was probably what she had envisioned in her mind for years and you took that away from her.\n\nWe are currently planning our wedding, it is a destination and we gave every 2 years advanced notice of the plan to allow them to save so they can attend. When planning the reception, which will happen back at home a few weeks later, my fianc\u00e9 is all about saving money and it makes me smile. \"Honey, we can afford more than just beer for our guests. We can afford to hire a DJ, we don't need to use your pandora and a decent speaker.\" But those are conversations we're having so that I know he's on board and he's okay with it and I'm not just planning everything without taking his perspective into account at all. \n\nYou are not starting your marriage off on a good note by dictating how the wedding will go with no regard for her feelings.

Save yourself a lot of trouble by not starting your marriage off on the wrong foot.\n\nEdit: damnit you did exactly what you shouldn\u2019t have. The big trips are supposed to be for your honeymoon/intimate time with your partner.", "YTA. I\u2019m going to tell you a little story. One of my very good friends is getting married on Sunday. It\u2019s about 2 hrs by plane from me. I lost my job. I have zero income. My other friend offered to pay for my flight. I said no. Here is why: first, it costs more than just a flight, I would need to eat the entire time I was there and get to and from places. These things have costs. Also, knowing my situation, I could not justify someone spending that money on a plane ticket when I have bills and no income. (My amazing friend gifted me the money and it\u2019s how I\u2019m paying bills right now but it won\u2019t last\u2026)\n\nSo your dad is a big shot and he\u2019s going to pay for everyone to fly there. Is he going to also pay for every single meal? Transportation? They\u2019ll need to take time off work if they have to leave the country, way more time than if it was local. Will he be covering everyone\u2019s lost wages? And that doesn\u2019t begin to address just how degrading this is. It\u2019s like you\u2019re rubbing your family\u2019s wealth in her family\u2019s face. \n\nYou KNEW her family could not afford this. You did this behind her back and gave her no say in her own wedding. \n\nI\u2019m amazed she hasn\u2019t called the whole thing off.", "Uh huh", "ESH. Neither of you appear to be making any real effort to communicate before acting.", "YTA.  As she said.  Brides generally have the say in weddings and you disregarded her feelings about the plans and added a place that would be cost that may not be feasible for her family.", "Wow, dude.  MASSIVE YAH.  You do not make this kind of decision on your own without fully consulting your to-be.  You know that the place you switched to was completely the opposite of what she would be, so instead of consulting her on WHY you want to switch and maybe find a compromise, you just did it yourself.\n\nThis is not the foundation for a marriage, it's the foundation of a dictatorship; anytime you decide you want to do something you KNOW she doesn't want to do, you'll just 'surprise' her?  I hope she puts the marriage on hold and insists you get couples counseling.  Your actions are borderline abusive, perhaps at BEST you just think you know better than she does so you will expect her to just bow to your wants over her concerns.\n\nI hope your bride sees this - assuming she hasn't already broken it off completely.", "I think both of you need to reconsider if marriage is the right thing. You\u2019re also 25 like that\u2019s really young", "YTA, you replanned the entire wedding without even taking to your fiancee in the slightest, and also made a major assumption, which is that she chose a venue, because it was cheap, because she's cheap, and not because it was meaningful to get?  Or didn't occur to you even once that maybe she actually wanted to get married in the same place she was christened in? Because that was a major life event for her and maybe, just maybe, she might want to have another life event in the same place?  You don't seem to know this woman at all and assume \"she's just cheap\", then tossed aside her entire wedding plan without a word, then went behind her back to plan the wedding you wanted with no input from her whatsoever. \n\n\nYou aren't ready to be married, you seem to have a pure opinion or your fiance (only chooses cheap things), and don't upstanding get in the slightest.  You are definitely an asshole. Of my husband changed ask our wedding plans behind my back, I honestly don't know what I would have done.  Jesus Christ, you are absolutely an asshole.", "Yta, she wants to get married in the church she was christened in, you are awful, change it back for her.", "OH shit I was really hoping you were asking for advice before doing this. YTA there is no way this wasnt going to blow up in your face. This is something you two should have discussed and offered, but you just unilaterally went and did it. You decided her only reason for that venue was money, that doesnt appear to be what she said.", "YTA. You literally took the wedding away from her. The whole damn thing. She didn\u2019t get to plan her own wedding because of you. Personally, I\u2019d cancel it anyway and leave your controlling ass.", "Weddings are a huge deal to most women. You're an asshole for not asking her before booking or telling anyone. She probably had already put together something beautiful in her mind and you've just stomped on that.", "Yta. She gets to choose the divorce lawyer.", "I am frankly surprised she is still willing to marry you.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  Down the line when she says she wants a small 4 door car and you come home with a full-size SUV and she doesn\u2019t like it will she be ungrateful or will you be controlling?  Some people don\u2019t need all the flash", "YTA basically you went \"Surprise! I threw out all of your wedding plans that you've probably been thinking about for a while and all your hard your and planned *MY* dream wedding for us, that your relatives may not be able up make because now is a destination wedding and there might be costs besides hotel and airfare I didn't think about!  Wait, why are you upset?  It's a surprise, the wedding you planned in that church that was super important to you was too cheap for my tastes, this is way better\".", "YTA \n\nEven if travel expenses are covered youve now asked struggling people to take significant time off work. \n\nYou\u2019ve ignored her desire to get married somewhere special to her \n\nWhat does Venice even hold for you two? Is it a special place you\u2019ve visited together?", "YTA", "YTA, you gave her no say in her wedding and you made sure her family is gonna feel extra poor during the entire thing, brave AH.", "absolutely YTA.  I can't imagine completely changing the wedding plans and not giving her a say in any of it.", "YTA\n\nNothing about a joint IMPORTANT event like a wedding should be a surprise .", "Omg. So self absorbed\u2026 yes my dear, YTA. \n\nFirst of all, how do you know she\u2019s not sentimentally attached to the church she grew up in? I got married in my home church almost an hour from my venue because it was important to me (even though I\u2019m not very religious). I didn\u2019t care if some people skipped church and came to the reception- the ceremony was about me and my husband- not them. \n\nAdditionally, if she grew up poor, what makes you think it\u2019s fair to ask her low income family to leave the country?! Even if you\u2019re paying for their transport and lodging, they still have to miss things like work, and frankly, I\u2019d bet that quite a few people on her side won\u2019t go. Changing a wedding venue is not a nice surprise.", "oh good god", "YTA. You two had a plan. Changing the plan without any of her input is not a fun surprise. You plan there won\u2019t be any big surprises. Just so you know for the future\u2026don\u2019t buy her a pet, a car, a house without consulting her. Big decisions need to be made together.", "I so blame rom-coms for making it seem like these gigantic gestures are romantic. Not only are they *not* romantic, they completely disregard the feelings of the person being \"surprised\".\n\nI'm also not excusing OP, and I'm not saying that the existence of this trope is why he did it. There's literally no excuse for him steamrolling her like that.", "I would absolutely call it off.  that's ridiculous.", "Obviously because than he (and his family) couldn't flash their money before her poor family.", "You do not surprise a BRIDE with me plans!", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. \u201cYou know what would be a good surprise though..surprising her with tickets to go to Venice on the honeymoon. Not completely uprooting something she carefully planned without even telling her..but maybe that\u2019s just me.\u201d", "How the hell is she overreacting??  This AH HIJACKED the whole wedding and then sent the invitations secretly so she couldn\u2019t change.  I hope she calls the whole thing off!!", "Health of the guests is another issue. Maybe not all of her family that she wants to be there are in a state for international travel.", "I would call off the wedding over something like this.", "Yup - I would have definitely guessed he was an only child if he hadn\u2019t said it in the post. It\u2019s some only child behavior", "catering, florist, entertainment. He literally dumped the entire already organized wedding down the drain and didn't even think twice.", "And all of the deposits. If OP's fianc\u00e9 and her parents contributed to the costs, that's just another fuck you to all of them.", "Or PTO, or childcare. Traveling to a local church for a day is an entirely different commitment.", "Yeah.  I work as a personal care aide for a disabled woman.  Her family wanted her to join them on a cruise, and she asked me to come with them to be her aide.  \n\nI wasn't able to go.  I had lost my birth certificate over the years, so I needed to get a new one.  It took months longer than the state website said it would.  Same thing with the passport, it took months to get processed, far longer than what the state department website said.  And the \"last minute\" option didn't work at all, if you asked for what was supposed to be a two-week expedited passport, and were willing to pay the fees, you still could not actually get an appointment to get one for several months.\n\nAn event that requires a passport to attend needs at least a year's notice, if the guests aren't regular international travelers who already have a passport.", "I would call off that wedding.  If she still loves OP, they can plan a wedding at a future date.  Their differing values, his condescension toward her and her family, his control... not a happy future ahead.  Work that shit out before saying \"I do.\"", "I would know what to do: it's called 'Hey, sorry to email you all but the wedding is off because it turns out I may not know my fiance as well as I thought, so for now, he's been given the ring back and we'll see how this plays out, but assume nothing is happening for at least the next year.  THANKS.  (ps: if this causes you to lose any money, please reach out to fiance since he will be reimbursing anyone for costs they cannot get back.)", "It doesn\u2019t matter where you are, you completely disregarded her in a major decision. Is this how it would be in your marriage? You could have simply told her a LONG time a go (when the planning was happening) that you didn\u2019t like the venue maybe change it for something bigger and then both of you look for something together, but no!! You had to go behind her back at last minute and change EVERYTHING that was already planned.", "Ah, so that explains the negligible emotional intelligence", "The romantic gesture could and should have been here I knownyou love Venice let's go for a 2 week honeymoon there. That's what daddy's money could have been used for instead of this horse shit. \n\nWith one month to go how does the bride source hair and make up or test it if she's having it, which if she wasn't before she now probably feels like she will need. What about all the other little things, flowers centre pieces all that shite these major weddings have? \n\nAnd what has her traditional family already laid money out for, and will this offend the crap out of them? When I hear traditional family with regard to a wedding I thing father of the bride is paying and its probably a matter of pride to the man. Op just took that away along with any non refundable deposits. Yes it's daft to think of that sort of thing but traditionally it's what happens and they're traditional. It's possible op just emasculated and offended his future fil badly.", "Yeah not wanting to be controlled by OP's family money is  a likely reason she wouldn't want this even though it's monetarily free", "What lol? Are all only children selfish? Bc I\u2019m one and I\u2019d never do this to my husband. My daughter is one, and she\u2019s empathetic to a fault that it makes her physically sick sometimes. The entitlement sounds like it comes from the fact he\u2019s rich and out of touch what poor actually means", "People with siblings hiding their bitterness over having to share behind hatred for us who didn't will never not be hilarious to me\n\nFor the record, I would never be as selfish as OP.", "Boils down to \"she's white trash and I'm just trying to help her see a different way of living.\"  Enormous ego on this one.", "Ooh, good point. Also dress travel issues. I mean, my wedding dress weighed probably around 35 lbs and needed two of us to carry it. You're not going to be able to take that as carry-on. My seamstress wrapped an entire sheet around it and pinned it in a specific way to protect the dress until the wedding. That was just to hang in a closet.\n\nCramming it into a suitcase (assuming you could find one big enough for it to fit in) is not going to anything good to it. I can't imagine what a wedding dress that's been crammed in a suitcase would look like. Plus airlines lose baggage ALL the time. Happened to me and happened to my brother. \n\nMy brother and SIL were on their honeymoon. Their bags didn't show up until the end of the week. What if the airline loses her dress?? Or what if the luggae getsndamaged by the baggage handlers and that results in damage to the dress?? If she had known/decided on a destination wedding, OP's fianc\u00e9 might have picked a very different dress. No way would I have picked a big ass ballgown knowing it would have to go on a plane. So angry on the bride's behalf.", "Not a problem for OP. He just doesn't have to deal with the poor family.\n\nThere's a chance this is controlling behavior disguised as best intentions.", "He didn't try to do a nice thing. He went behind her back and told her at the last moment", "How can you possibly say he tried to do a nice thing?", "plus *every single vendor* is now useless, and i bet he's not the one reorganizing those.", "You nailed it. YTA", "Yikes! If there\u2019s superstition involved, no way this marriage is happening. \ud83e\udd1e", "It shows itself in different ways, didn\u2019t say every only child would display the exact behavior of OP. My guess is you were primarily in charge of your wedding venue as it was so why would you have felt the need to change it? But not surprised that an only child who had an only child can\u2019t see how being an only child might affect their personality. Not saying all are selfish, many are able to grow out of it, but makes a big difference when you grow up only having to look out for #1 vs having to think about and understand your siblings perspectives", "Oh bro, I grew up with money, I barely had to share. But it\u2019s also nvr been a struggle for me to think beyond just myself. Best of both worlds I guess.", "Absolutely. And the bride may want something to compliment the surroundings, and temperature, and if there\u2019s a beach, or water. It\u2019s all just a terrible idea. There\u2019s no reason why a grand Italian trip couldn\u2019t have been the honeymoon. This whole thing is a disaster waiting to happen - the wedding and most likely the marriage.", "No passport is needed, but still YTA.", "What's saying he can't veto though? The conversation never even happened.", "but changing the venue to another country isn't just changing the venue. it now means *everything* has to be changed. Literally everything. She now has to find someone in *venice* to do flowers, catering, makeup, but I guarantee OP didn't even think about those.  \n\n\nSo she'd have to reorganize an entire wedding from scratch because he wanted something flashy.", "Yeah this still makes no sense at all. I also have a half brother, but we only lived together for two years. I assume you\u2019re from a family w siblings so you\u2019d know nothing about how only children grow up or internalize or learn empathy or adopt their own families or having to be the sole caretakers of their parents. Very narrow minded way of thinking and really have no clue. \n\nOf course the way you grow up has an impact on how you grow up, but you actually thinking only children don\u2019t have to worry about anyone but themselves is absurd. Like i said this guy sounds entitled bc he was raised to be entitled bc his father had a ton of disposable income that the majority of us will never have nor grew up with", "You really hit some only child nerves \ud83d\ude02", "Yup, we pay for IDs, and have to go to the DMV for them, which in many places has incredibly restrictive hours. And then politicians will make laws that require IDs in order to vote, while not making it easier for poor working people to get IDs.", "That's my point. So many people talking about the sentimentality of the venue. It's absolutely true that it's possibly sentimental and not just cost, I'm just saying he wouldn't have been an AH for vetoing it during that conversation just because it was sentimental.", "Yeah only children are really sensitive about being called out. Not surprised you had this reaction. This really isn\u2019t new territory or some groundbreaking idea that I came up with myself. Have a good night.", "You reacting this way is PEAK only child.", "That was my first thought, he's wrong to assume the venue choice was just about being stingy. And even if she doesn't personally care, her relatives might", "It sounds like you don\u2019t like the pushback for your absurd opinion"]}
