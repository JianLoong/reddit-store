Teacher has no business in taking something you bought with your own money and giving it to another student.\n\nBesides if A is doing stuff like this no wonder you don't want to be friends with her and honestly nobody should force you. You don't have to be friends with everbody you meet.\n\nNTA.", "Did I read right? You yourself brought the money for the pizza and then this teacher steals it from you to give it someone else?\nWithout asking your side of the story?\n\nThe messed up order was not your fault, but you are the only one that has to solve the issue with her short sub?\n\nThe teacher could have ordered an other sub or a second pizza for her, just like they did with your order. Or she could share her own meal. Instead she snitches your food.\n\nNo matter If You liked the girl or not, teacher messed up a Lil bit. \nI bet she meant well with the sharing, but the situation was unfortunate. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
