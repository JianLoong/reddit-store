They're probably seeing this as a 'gift' (because it's so much more than what the work was worth) and wondering why you gave this 'gift' to one kid instead of splitting it between them. Even if it was 12 hours of work that's over $40/hr. If y'all were only there for 8 hours (after this deal was struck), that's over $60/hr.

From your point of view I can see how \"we're at a theme park and this means you will have to babysit all day instead of enjoy the theme park without a 2-year old on your hip\" means the $500 was worth it to you, but I don't think the rest of the family is on the same page as you on this, which isn't your fault or theirs, hence my ruling.\n\nI wouldn't suggest doing this in exactly the same way again, now that you know how everyone feels about it.

I appreciate that.", "Fair wages are what someone is willing to pay. Worth is subjective. It's why \"modern art\" of paint splattered on canvas sales for millions to some and is worthless to others.

It's a payment.", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about things that may or may not be true. Maybe OP can weigh in. Because in most families there will be someone who doesn\u2019t like rides. Or people who don\u2019t want to go on rides all day. Hell - maybe the 17 year old doesn\u2019t even like rides? Regardless, if OP could have hired a competent babysitter for less than $100 and paid he\u2019s nephew $500 it does seem like favouritism. \n\nYou also didn\u2019t answer my last question.

But you wouldn\u2019t expect to pay 5x the amount for a product at the corner store vs Walmart. I\u2019m not saying the kid shouldn\u2019t have gotten a premium - I\u2019m saying that giving him **SUCH** a premium isn\u2019t a **FAIR** thing to do in a family situation where more than one person is capable of performing the job. \n\n>He set his price, it was almost definitely his 'you probably won't and you won't keep asking me to do this' price.\n\nI totally agree. I think the kid threw out an enormous number thinking OP wouldn\u2019t agree.", "To be honest, I think he's more upset that I let a teenager watch him for so long. He doesn't know my cousin as well as I do. I watched that kid grow up, and hubby met him at our wedding. He doesn't know how responsible the kid is. He'll get over it.", "I still disagree with your judgement of ESH because I think $500 is a fair price for babysitting while at an amusement park. The cousin is being compensated for babysitting while on vacation, which is a much different thing than babysitting in general. Everyone has a different value of money, but this seems like a reasonable price given the sacrifice made by the cousin - it was a payment for service and not a handout. \n\nI also don't agree that 15 is necessarily old enough to babysit, especially at an amusement park. Being in a high-traffic public place makes babysitting significantly more difficult. OP says that they specifically trust this older cousin as being responsible.", "Your husband is being ridiculous...  he doesn't want to take responsibility for the kid, but he also doesn't want anyone else to except you...\n\nwhat I don't get is, if you have the money to pay someone $500 to watch your kid for half a day...  why not just buy your husband a ticket so he can go?\n\nAt first I presumed the husband didn't want to spend the money to go...  but it sounds like he just didn't want to and you let him stay home and ruin your day?  If your nephew hadn't wanted to watch kiddo, what would you have done then???\n\nAnd now he's giving you the silent treatment?  Is your husband always a rotten stick in the mud???", "He just doesn't like theme parks and didn't want to go. He doesn't drag me to football Sunday. We love each other, but we don't always want to do exactly the same thing.\n\nI took my son to my family reunion because it's a family reunion. I wanted him to see his family, and his family wanted to see him.", "YTA!! For bringing a kid too young to do anything at an amusement park. Also for bribing (that's what you did) your cousin to watch your kid so you could go on all the rides. What if he wanted to ride rides too? Sorry being a parent sucks sometimes (speaking as a mom). Sometimes you HAVE to miss out on fun stuff. That's life.", "NTA. They're just haters. This seems like an elegant solution. You spent half the day with your son, he got to spend half the day with his cousin, your cousin got $500. Why are they all mad about a win win win situation?", "NTA - but your husband appears to be based on your comments.  I can not understand not supporting your partner by going to the family reunion with them.  Especially so they are not stuck as the sole caregiver for our child at the reunion.\n\nAunt is completely entitled AH if he doesn't understand you didn't gift your cousin, but instead paid for a service he rendered for you.", "Here's a question. Why didn't your husband go and watch the baby for you? So you could have some fun. Does he take the baby to football days or does he get free time to enjoy himself? Funny how that works. As far as your Aunt? I'd be cutting ties with her. It was absolutely none of her business and then she told on you? Is she 12?", "He\u2019s mad bc he looks ridiculous and an ass for not going. He\u2019s embarrassed", "He\u2019s giving you the silent treatment because you didn\u2019t spend the whole day with your son when he literally did not even go? He can fuck right off with that. You having to pay someone to watch the kid so you can get a break  just makes him look like an even  bigger jerk than he did by not going.\n\nETA judgement: NTA - You paid one person who  was responsible enough to care for your child to do so. The other kids had fun and (as stated) were not old enough for that responsibility anyway.", "Nta it was fair n square", "NTA, you had a financial conversation with someone who was in a position, given that you were not pressuring them and that they are an older teen, and came to a financial agreement. You paid your part, they did the labor.\n\n It sounds like your aunt is only angry because she didn't get a cut, which he had no right to since she did not perform the service, the same goes for her daughters. The offer was made to a responsible individual who would actually take care of the child, you weren't handing out half a grand for play money. Your husband is an asshole for giving you the silent treatment for not spending the whole day with your child. You are allowed to have a break him treating you like an asshole for wanting to enjoy your life and making sure the child was properly taken care of is ridiculous. He needs to apologize to you", "NTA. You asked your cousin because you trust him. He named his price you agreed that $500 was a fair price to enjoy yourself that day. They\u2019re just salty that they didn\u2019t get the money themselves. Besides your husband has no reason to be mad about it since it didn\u2019t affect his plans at all. He has to understand that you\u2019re not just a mom, you\u2019re a whole person, and you deserve to get a break and have fun every now and then.", "NTA\n\nHer logic makes no sense", "NTA", "NTA", "OP decided to take her child with her. Nothing to do with husband not wanting/willing to watch them", "> ($500 for the day seems steep)\n\nyeah $500 for a day is expensive if you *booked* a babysitter\n\nlast minute is gonna cost more\n\nreally weird how ppl are just ignoring that completely lol\u2014never tried to get a day-of plane ticket?", "At 17, and at 6 flags. $20 and a soft pretzel, I would have noped out of that. $500, hell yes! Give me that baby!!!", "NTA. Rider swap is a thing at many parks. It\u2019s amazing!", "Op said he didn't want to go.  Kind of a dick move if you ask me.", "Lol she clearly lacks in negotiation skills.", "We were at Disney last month and almost lost our 6 year old. My husband and I were separated by a crowd and each thought she was with the other. Luckily she was close by and we found her quickly but she was sobbing and we were both panicking.\n\nHaving one person clearly in charge of a kid is best. \n\nI also would definitely not trust a 12 year old to watch a toddler at ab amusement park and it would very much dependent on the 15 year old. But if there was a responsible 17 year old, hd would be my first choice.", "I think it's because the 17 yo is a...*gasp!*...boy!", "She paid the teenager for babysitting AnD for giving up his own day at the amusement park.\n\nNTA, OP. My family just took off on me when I was that age and left me with my young cousins.", "If you had ripped off your cousin's time at the theme park by only paying going rate you would have been TA. But that's why it cost more.", "Honestly just sounds like she was properly evaluated how much his time was worth. Watching a toddler in that environment, and missing out on all of the things, is worth throwing some money at the cousin", "Watching a two year old all afternoon at an amusement park is not a simple task. The cousin also had to give up going on rides.", "Isn't your child 2? Hes not even gonna remember this day.\nProbably should've left him at home with ur husband\n\nStill NTA tho", "i do that with ice cream (i always buy the expensive one)", "Nice. *Internet fist bump*", "Holy crap where do you live? I got more than $10 an hour in the NINETIES", "Where are you living that you can get daycare for $800 a month? I felt lucky finding a place that was $1800 for the month - most in my area are $2K+ a month.\n\nAlso babysitters are $20+ an hour, depending on experience.", "This article includes typical wages for babysitters in Canada. \n\n[CBC Article](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5394813)", "Agree to disagree. *Most* 15 year olds  (at least the ones I know) are fully capable of watching a toddler. Hell - you can drive at 15 in most US states. The accepted babysitting age is 12 in most places in the US and Canada and even 11 is accepted in many areas. \n\nWe may just have very different experiences with teenagers and their maturity. \n\nAnd different experiences with how much money $500 is.", "12 and 11 are good babysitting ages in a private residence, not a public theme park. I don't think you can even enter without an adult at those ages.", "Okay, but seeing and knowing your family and helping look after the child you have together isn't the same as football.", "Listen, you are NTA, but you keep saying \u201cmy son had to go because he\u2019s family and it\u2019s a family reunion\u201d. Why isn\u2019t your husband family?\n\nThat just seems so bizarre to me. My family would find it very strange if we had a family reunion and spouses didn\u2019t go just because.", "What you (and everyone) seems to be missing is the opportunity you gave your 17 year old nephew vs the other kids.\n\nIf they truly aren\u2019t old enough to watch your kid - no issue. Case closed.\n\nHowever, if there was a way you could have allowed all of them to share the duties or another alternate arrangement which would have allowed all of them the opportunity to make **BIG** coin, then I think you should have considered that.\n\nLet me try and put it another way. (In this case we are assuming that the other teens would have been capable of watching your toddler). Let\u2019s say I have 3 employees. I need someone to work on Christmas Day and I\u2019m willing to pay 5x the going rate for someone to work. I make this offer to one employee and they **JUMP** at the chance. I am just so happy that I don\u2019t have to work on Christmas that I didn\u2019t consider that the other employers may have wanted the chance to earn that extra money. The other employees express that they wish they had been given the option. Should I have tried to make things more fair?\n\nMy **ONLY** issue with your actions is that you *may* have created a situation where one teen was given a major opportunity to earn $ and the others weren\u2019t.", "Yes, exactly, their son is not an optional hobby."]}
