Getting into a transaction with a 17 year old and not involving the parents or considering their approval of it, is shady.\n\nYou owe nothing to the the siblings, but you might owe the aunt a slight apology for paying her kid $500 without getting her permission first.\n\nThe reason this isn't absolute is because 17 is right on the cusp of being an adult and then the aunt wouldn't be involved anymore.\n\nI also think $500 is a large amount of money, especially for one day's work, which just makes the \"you did a transaction with my child without my permission\" issue bigger. They're probably seeing this as a 'gift' (because it's so much more than what the work was worth) and wondering why you gave this 'gift' to one kid instead of splitting it between them. Even if it was 12 hours of work that's over $40/hr. If y'all were only there for 8 hours (after this deal was struck), that's over $60/hr.

From your point of view I can see how \"we're at a theme park and this means you will have to babysit all day instead of enjoy the theme park without a 2-year old on your hip\" means the $500 was worth it to you, but I don't think the rest of the family is on the same page as you on this, which isn't your fault or theirs, hence my ruling.\n\nI wouldn't suggest doing this in exactly the same way again, now that you know how everyone feels about it.

The value of something is set by the person willing to pay for it. If it was worth $500 for you then that's what the going rate was. You didn't gift anything.

I appreciate that.", "Fair wages are what someone is willing to pay. Worth is subjective. It's why \"modern art\" of paint splattered on canvas sales for millions to some and is worthless to others. OP didn't want a hotdog and a slurpee. She wanted a baby sitter and she paid what she was willing to pay to get one at that moment. It's not a gift. It's a payment.", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about things that may or may not be true. Maybe OP can weigh in. Because in most families there will be someone who doesn\u2019t like rides. Or people who don\u2019t want to go on rides all day. Hell - maybe the 17 year old doesn\u2019t even like rides? Regardless, if OP could have hired a competent babysitter for less than $100 and paid he\u2019s nephew $500 it does seem like favouritism. \n\nYou also didn\u2019t answer my last question.

He'll get over it.", "I still disagree with your judgement of ESH because I think $500 is a fair price for babysitting while at an amusement park. The cousin is being compensated for babysitting while on vacation, which is a much different thing than babysitting in general. Everyone has a different value of money, but this seems like a reasonable price given the sacrifice made by the cousin - it was a payment for service and not a handout. \n\nI also don't agree that 15 is necessarily old enough to babysit, especially at an amusement park. Being in a high-traffic public place makes babysitting significantly more difficult. OP says that they specifically trust this older cousin as being responsible.", "Your husband is being ridiculous...  he doesn't want to take responsibility for the kid, but he also doesn't want anyone else to except you...\n\nwhat I don't get is, if you have the money to pay someone $500 to watch your kid for half a day...  why not just buy your husband a ticket so he can go?\n\nAt first I presumed the husband didn't want to spend the money to go...  but it sounds like he just didn't want to and you let him stay home and ruin your day?
