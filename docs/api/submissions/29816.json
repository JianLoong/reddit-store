When I went to live with them, he was jealous of me, probably used to being an only child. He would say mean things to me when our parents weren\u2019t around, like my \u201creal parents\u201d didn\u2019t want me.

Well, a few months ago he reached out to me. He said he wanted to tell me that his girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was pregnant and that the prospect of being a father made him think back to our childhood and how he treated me; he wanted to apologize; I said I was not interested in building a relationship given our history but wished him the best.\n\nLast week I saw him and his fianc\u00e9e at our parents\u2019 house for our mom\u2019s birthday. She met me in the kitchen and said something like: so you\u2019ll soon be an uncle! I told her I would not be an uncle, because as her partner always said, I\u2019m not really his brother. She seemed really shocked; I got the feeling he never disclosed our history to her. I think I could have been nicer since she\u2019s not to blame and I admit seeing him is still triggers bad memories to me. \n\nMy cousin/brother texted me the next day asking why did I say this to his fianc\u00e9e and that I\u2019m within my right not to forgive him but he\u2019s hoping I leave her out of this.

But in terms of the rest of the family perhaps you should reconsider. You are denying yourself possible love, and relationships. Perhaps consider therapy again to work through the hurt he has caused you.", "I understand this reaction, but your just continuing the cycle that your brother started, he refused to see you as his brother, now you refuse to see this child as your niece/nephew. You don't have to forgive him, but you can teach his child how it is wrong to treat someone like less that because of a lack of blood relation, that family is something you choose and you choose to be an uncle, even if you aren't chosen as a brother. I won't call you an AH for it but you are acting out of pain", "NTA\n\n'Uncle' is just a label. What matters is the actual relationship. I've been an 'uncle' to a friends child. I loved that child and we had a great bond. Gave me some of my happiest memories that I will never forget. Life is short - don't miss out on the best things about it.\n\nYour brother was a kid who had issues. He's possibly a much better person now. What about you, what's your mental health like? What if those bad memories could be consigned to history? What if you could have a nicer life enriched with better relationships? \n\nPerhaps here is that opportunity. At age 22 your judgement draws on precious little life experience. Don't make shortsighted decisions driven by raw emotion and pain. It's hard to forgive, move on, and heal - but maybe you should for your own sake? Even just one more positive relationship is better than nothing. Something to consider.", "ESH except the SIL\n\nYou lashed out at the innocent party here.

She hasn\u2019t done anything except try to include you and build a relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely possible to have a relationship with your nibling without buddying up to your brother btw.", "NTA but maybe leave the door a bit open?

You don't have to have a relationship with him or his child or his fiancee. But find a way to forgive him.", "I suppose he didn't get the help he needed when he was only 9 (!), and his family changed suddenly. He also had a rough time, but definitely not as rough as you. Still, he was still a small boy, and he needed support to cope with this situation, but he didn't get it apparently.\n\nIt is not your job to be empathetic, so you can rightly say that you don't want to see him as a brother. I would suggest you considered though to work on your issues, because you can also win a lot if you two can resolve your pain. You say he triggers bad memories, but it would be possible to live without these, wouldn't it be great?", "NTA for your feelings of hurt it is your right to feel what you feel. but they tried \n to make amends they apologized for their behavior when they were children-teens and want to make you part of this family and for you to be the uncle of their kid. The fianc\u00e9 and the child have no fault in any of this. My honest advice is for you to try to find a way to forgive and move on bcs you will be banning your own self from new experiences with your family members and from creating any meaningful contact with your niece/nephew. Be careful not to regret the choices you are making now at only 22, in the future", "YTA bc I don't think that was the appropriate time to have that conversation. Or the appropriate person to have it with.

Your attitude is no better than your brother/cousin growing up", "YTA", "YTA for putting it that way to her, she didn't know about problems.", "NTA for telling her. But I don't see why you can't be like an uncle to the child. It was your cousin who wronged you, not the child. Instead of letting your cousin come in between, why not have a nice niece/nephew and uncle relationship and enjoy it? Plus the future SIL seems like a nice person as well.\nYour cousin was an absolute AH for bullying you. \nBut seems like maybe he's trying to change and everyone deserves a second chance don't they? I'm not saying become best friends with him or even good friends but just enough to stay in one room without getting triggered. Maybe trying to have an amicable relationship with him will help you to move on and not hurt as much.\n\nYou giving him a second chance in no way means that what he did has been erased or forgotten. He hurt you. And that fact will forever remain. You just have to move ahead with it, without it hurting you or bring trauma back.\n\nAbove everything else, do it for yourself.", "Kids do stupid shit.
