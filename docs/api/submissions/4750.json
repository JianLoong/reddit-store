You just asked him to cut back on how often he's showering, because its raising your water bill. He's gaslighting and trying to throw the issue back on you instead of addressing the problem which isn't his masturbation habits. It's how much of your water he's wasting.", "This is drug-use behavior, not nut-busting behavior", "NTA. That's a lot of money and water wasted for no reason. If he wants to have his \"time\" and all those showers, then he can either pay more for rent or move out and have all the showers he wants. If your wife wasn't going to talk to him, someone needed to; it's your and her money being spent on a bill that is his fault for being higher than normal.", "NTA your wife sucks tho", "NTA: he has no respect for you. Him paying more will not change his behavior this is just not going to work time to go.", "NTA. Are you 100% sure he is showering and not just using shower as noise to mask whatever else he might be doing in there? Cause that may be the case, if he's bringing his phone for example.\n\nHonestly how old is your BIL? Your wife is enabling him to a point, that BIL is now causing fights between you two. If she's so adamant, maybe she should pay for the water bill spike herself then.", "NTA. I feel like something else is going on here (I don't know what exactly, I'm just suspicious of the multiple showers a day without changing or being wet), but if he's going to use all that water, he needs to pay for it, regardless of what's happening in there.", "Leave them both and let her pay the water bill. NTA.", "NTA unless they want to start paying the water bill themselves", "NTA. If he wants this to become a whole thing, I'm sure you can supply him with a few past water bills and then the current one. If he wants to keep doing whatever it is that he's doing, he can pay the difference.", "NTA. Bro may have a medical condition or is doing drugs. I would check for leaks first. If there aren't any leaks, then by all means make him pay for the extra water usage.", "When he pays the water bill it\u2019s not your business, right now it very much is your business.  Financially and environmentally irresponsible.", "NTA - make him start paying the difference between the old water bill and the current water bill. If he refuses, position yourself at the house\u2019s shutoff valve every time he goes to shower.", "NTA\n\nWhen my sister was living with us, we split all of the bills equally.  Try doing this and when he sees how high his share of the water bill is, maybe he'll be incentivized to shower less", "ESH you kicked him out once already and now he's back being an asshole lol what did you expect", "NTA you shouldn't have taken him back in after the first time.", "Buy some cleenex wipes maybe, and place them strategically in/around his room? ;-)", "info\n\nDid your electric or gas bill also go up because of the showers? Hot water uses energy.  Unless he is taking cold showers and flashing the toilet hundreds of times a day.   You could have a leak if you are in a house.   Nah, He is most likely self Lovering and using noise from the noise shower to muffle the sound.", "NTA- thats such a waste of water and money. You're setting rules for your own house. If it was his house then he can waste as much water as he wants but it isnt.", "NTA.  \n\nHe's paying some rent, yes?  Here's what I would do.  Figure out whatever the normal water bill was before he moved in.  Multiply it by 1.5 - that should reflect going from a two-person household to a 3-person household.  Tell him you're taking that amount off the rent he pays, and you now expect him to cover the water bill in full.  \n\nThen the water bill isn't your concern, nor how many showers he takes, nor what he does in there.  He pays for 100% of anything above normal usage. And if he doesn't like it, he's free to get his own place.", "NTA \n\nHow big a bill are we talking about here?", "NTA. I can't see why you took him back in if this is his general attitude.\n\n~~Edit: Changed to YTA You confronted him without talking to your wife? For me, that's a big no-no. Also, I'm having my doubts on the way you confronted him. I understand you're mad, and I would be too, but I'm getting the impression that you have an antagonising way of dealing with confrontations.~~", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The issue is that he's driving the utilities up with  excessive water usage. Your wife and BIL are being deliberately obtuse. Since he's coming out dry and in the same clothes I suspect he is purposely running up your bill out of spite not personal activity. He's probably just sitting in there playing on his cellphone and running the shower empty as retribution against you. Present him the bill. Tell him he either pays the bill or he starts to conserve your utilities or he can GTFO and stay out.", "NTA - anything more than 1 (maybe 2 if you go to the gym/dirty job) shower a day is excessive", "NTA, out he goes again, this time for good.", "I second the suggestion that you check to see if there might be something else contributing to the water bill spike. Depending on the shower head, it uses about 1.5 - 2.5 gallons per minute, so if he's running the shower for 20 minutes every time, that could do it. But, you should have double checked before confronting him.\n\nAs far as what he's doing in there... he has his own room? I'm assuming he could turn on a radio or something to cover any sounds he makes while doing whatever he does. Was this frequent showering something he did when he lived with you before? It could be drugs, but it could also be something health related. Your wife said she would handle it, so YTA.\n\nThe proper solution would be him paying more money to cover use beyond what it was before he moved in & taking however many showers he wants.", "ESH\n\nYour wife said she was going to handle it and you have her like a day. It wasn't an emergency.\n\nThat said, she should have handled it and your BIL is TA for obvious reasons.", "NTA. It sounds more like drugs than beating the meat.", "NTA. Maybe it's time to kick him out again. You can reconcile and keep him AWAY from your house.", "NTA, his answer shows that he's definitely going in there to tug it too.  Could the cost be something different though? I shower 3 times a day on average especially in the summer and my bill is never that high, could just be my city has cheaper water.", "NTA.", "This. And, also, what the heck else is he doing? I assumed that he was masturbating too. But if he's not, he has another issue. Either way, OP, I would tell him he needs to start covering the increase in the water bill.\n\nAnd... get him out again soon. It sounds like he and your wife just gang up on you.", "That's what I thought. He's hot boxing in the bathroom.", "Yea right, she's usually cool though", "OP said they put \"showering\" in quotations because he doesn't come out with different clothes or wet. He is 1000% just running the shower to cover up something else which makes it that much more unnecessary to be running up the water bill.", "I almost wonder if he is smoking something in the bathroom? I've never understood the \"science\" behind it, but I've had multiple smoker(stoner) friends swear that the steam makes the smoke smell evaporate faster or something...? Again, as a stoner myself, that sounds like stoner-science to me but that honestly seems less weird than he needs to go jerk off in the shower multiple times a day and doesn't change his clothes afterwards.", "This was my thought\u2026 why did you let him back in the house and expect it to be different", "Not sure but will investigate", "That's a good point. These would have to be some long showers, if they tripled the water bill. He should check other issues as well. Also, maybe invest in a low flow shower head.", "It was $45 when he wasn't here. \n\nWith him here it's $119", ".he did talk to wife first. She did nothing...or BIL ignored her. Wife had the opportunity to fix it and didn't. The very next day BIL was right back to multiple showers. I'd be banging down a door with a nasty attitude if my utility bills tripled too", "also, he is 1000% \"doing his business\" and it's insane that he would even have the nerve to \"shower\" that many times a day when he doesn't pay the water bill", "Honestly I'd be concerned about drug use. Going in and coming out in same clothes, hair dry, 3-4 times a day, overly defensive....does he have a history of drug use perhaps?", "If OP and wife shower daily and BIL takes 3-4 showers daily, but a bit longer, it would be easy to triple water use", "Holy shit. Unless you live in a place with unusually expensive water, he must be taking more than 4 showers a day. Or very long showers.", "I need to stop commenting when I'm this tired \ud83d\ude05", "No that's why I ruled out drug use", "Depends on what else they use water on. It would be helpful if OP said if they have kids in the house & if the BIL showers for 10 minutes or 20+.", "Lol been there done that", "Well he might have developed an issue recently, lots of family members of addicts are surprised to learn their brother/parent/cousin/best friend is addicted because \"they didn't seem like that kind of person \" or \"they never used before\". I wouldn't dismiss the idea completely,  especially if his behavior continues. Even if he was using porn in there, 3-4 times a day? When he presumably has a bedroom?", "3-4 times a day? \n\nHe's hotboxing. I know it because that's the same exact shit I used to do, thankfully the place I lived at utilities were included so I didn't care, but if I were you, I'd be keeping close tabs on him and seeing what he's doing.", "Honestly idk about drug use but reading about the sheer frequency...OP if I were you I would be worried, something's highly fishy here."]}
