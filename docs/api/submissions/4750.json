Figure out whatever the normal water bill was before he moved in.  Multiply it by 1.5 - that should reflect going from a two-person household to a 3-person household.  Tell him you're taking that amount off the rent he pays, and you now expect him to cover the water bill in full.  \n\nThen the water bill isn't your concern, nor how many showers he takes, nor what he does in there.

The issue is that he's driving the utilities up with  excessive water usage. Your wife and BIL are being deliberately obtuse. Since he's coming out dry and in the same clothes I suspect he is purposely running up your bill out of spite not personal activity. He's probably just sitting in there playing on his cellphone and running the shower empty as retribution against you. Present him the bill. Tell him he either pays the bill or he starts to conserve your utilities or he can GTFO and stay out.", "NTA - anything more than 1 (maybe 2 if you go to the gym/dirty job) shower a day is excessive", "NTA, out he goes again, this time for good.", "I second the suggestion that you check to see if there might be something else contributing to the water bill spike. Depending on the shower head, it uses about 1.5 - 2.5 gallons per minute, so if he's running the shower for 20 minutes every time, that could do it. But, you should have double checked before confronting him.\n\nAs far as what he's doing in there... he has his own room? I'm assuming he could turn on a radio or something to cover any sounds he makes while doing whatever he does. Was this frequent showering something he did when he lived with you before? It could be drugs, but it could also be something health related. Your wife said she would handle it, so YTA.\n\nThe proper solution would be him paying more money to cover use beyond what it was before he moved in & taking however many showers he wants.", "ESH\n\nYour wife said she was going to handle it and you have her like a day. It wasn't an emergency.\n\nThat said, she should have handled it and your BIL is TA for obvious reasons.", "NTA. It sounds more like drugs than beating the meat.", "NTA. Maybe it's time to kick him out again. You can reconcile and keep him AWAY from your house.", "NTA, his answer shows that he's definitely going in there to tug it too.  Could the cost be something different though? I shower 3 times a day on average especially in the summer and my bill is never that high, could just be my city has cheaper water.", "NTA.", "This. And, also, what the heck else is he doing? I assumed that he was masturbating too. But if he's not, he has another issue. Either way, OP, I would tell him he needs to start covering the increase in the water bill.\n\nAnd... get him out again soon. It sounds like he and your wife just gang up on you.", "That's what I thought. He's hot boxing in the bathroom.", "Yea right, she's usually cool though", "OP said they put \"showering\" in quotations because he doesn't come out with different clothes or wet. He is 1000% just running the shower to cover up something else which makes it that much more unnecessary to be running up the water bill.", "I almost wonder if he is smoking something in the bathroom? I've never understood the \"science\" behind it, but I've had multiple smoker(stoner) friends swear that the steam makes the smoke smell evaporate faster or something...? Again, as a stoner myself, that sounds like stoner-science to me but that honestly seems less weird than he needs to go jerk off in the shower multiple times a day and doesn't change his clothes afterwards.", "This was my thought\u2026 why did you let him back in the house and expect it to be different", "Not sure but will investigate", "That's a good point. These would have to be some long showers, if they tripled the water bill. He should check other issues as well. Also, maybe invest in a low flow shower head.", "It was $45 when he wasn't here. \n\nWith him here it's $119", ".he did talk to wife first. She did nothing...or BIL ignored her. Wife had the opportunity to fix it and didn't. The very next day BIL was right back to multiple showers. I'd be banging down a door with a nasty attitude if my utility bills tripled too", "also, he is 1000% \"doing his business\" and it's insane that he would even have the nerve to \"shower\" that many times a day when he doesn't pay the water bill", "Honestly I'd be concerned about drug use. Going in and coming out in same clothes, hair dry, 3-4 times a day, overly defensive....does he have a history of drug use perhaps?", "If OP and wife shower daily and BIL takes 3-4 showers daily, but a bit longer, it would be easy to triple water use", "Holy shit. Unless you live in a place with unusually expensive water, he must be taking more than 4 showers a day. Or very long showers.", "I need to stop commenting when I'm this tired \ud83d\ude05", "No that's why I ruled out drug use", "Depends on what else they use water on. It would be helpful if OP said if they have kids in the house & if the BIL showers for 10 minutes or 20+.", "Lol been there done that", "Well he might have developed an issue recently, lots of family members of addicts are surprised to learn their brother/parent/cousin/best friend is addicted because \"they didn't seem like that kind of person \" or \"they never used before\". I wouldn't dismiss the idea completely,  especially if his behavior continues. Even if he was using porn in there, 3-4 times a day? When he presumably has a bedroom?", "3-4 times a day? \n\nHe's hotboxing. I know it because that's the same exact shit I used to do, thankfully the place I lived at utilities were included so I didn't care, but if I were you, I'd be keeping close tabs on him and seeing what he's doing.", "Honestly idk about drug use but reading about the sheer frequency...OP if I were you I would be worried, something's highly fishy here.", "you\u2019re saying he comes out dry looking, is it possible he\u2019s just turning out the shower to drown out the noise of something else?

Her trying to section off that you shouldn't even talk to him is basically her trying to cut you off and say that you don't have the power to confront the extra person in your house. \n\nYour issue is that your wife isn't your partner here, and he needs to go cuz it sounds like whatever issues you reconciled, he's still a problem", "NTA, you need to raise it now.", "And your wife either, cuz the real issue is is that she was trying to cut you off to say you don't have the right to confront him.\n\nYou just need to tell him and your wife he needs to pack his bags now. This isn't working and it is both of y'all's house, you no longer can send to him staying so he's going and then you and your wife can try to deal with her allegiance issues, since you two are supposed to be partners, not her and her brother", "Oh he's definitely rubbing one out.\n\nAs someone who's wife shuts the gate when I piss her off, that's definitely what the extra long showers are.", "But I mean what's usually? Usually dealing with her brother? Cuz if you're saying she's cool when she's not under any sort of stress or has mixed allegiances, that's just how she acts when she's not tested", "That's really all that I can think of, like him running the shower to not get in it at all screams pot to me. Because if he was jerking it the warm water would feel nice", "DRUUUUUUUUUUUUGS\n\nHe's doing drugs in the bathroom, man. If he's not actually bathing, and he's got the shower running, he's in there getting high. He probably brought up the masturbation thing to make you uncomfortable with the topic altogether and associate the \"showers\" with something outrageous to prevent you from thinking about what he's actually doing in there. It's already working on your wife (who really needs to grow a spine, like, it's not your job to house and fund her adult brother.) You need to kick him out immediately. NTA for anything you've done so far, but seriously, stop letting him come back.", "Why'd you kick him out the first time? My guess for what he's doing is using drugs, either smoking something or could be taking anything that takes some time, maybe he takes a few puffs of a joint (or any drug) then waits a long time to try to let the smell clear out.\n\nWhatever he's doing you are NTA, raise his rent if it happens again", "NTA       \nMaybe look into a shower noise machine? /s", "NTA -Dude, chill! op\u2019s issue is not how often you yank your crank, it\u2019s how often you\u2019re yankin\u2019 that shower faucet handle", "I lived with a roommate last year, and he took frequent, sporadic \u201cshowers\u201d and \u201cbaths\u201d.
