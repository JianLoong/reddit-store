Her uncle owns a resort and has offered amazing discounts on rooms to her guests. We've had this planned for months, RSVP'd, booked a room, arranged childcare, everything. \n\nNow his brother wants to get married the weekend of the wedding. They're not really doing anything, just a quick ceremony and party in my in-law's backyard. It will be more like a family barbecue then any kind of actual wedding. \n\nMy husband wants to cancel everything so we can be in town. I don't want to cancel, for the reasons outlined above. We've been in an arguement about it. I suggested that his brother can just move it to the weekend before or after. They don't have out of town guests, a wedding venue or vendors booked, or anything that would stop them from being able to move it so my husband and I can attend. It's just pure stubbornness. \n\nMy husband isn't backing me up on this at all and has definitely been talking shit to his family about me, which I hate. He thinks I'm being entitled. \n\nIf his brother was having a real wedding that had been planned for months and involved a ton of time/money spent I'd feel differently.

How on earth are you being entitled? You r.s.v.p.\u2019d yes to your friend\u2019s wedding months before your BIL announced his wedding, and your husband went right along with it. You made financial arrangements and have booked child care arrangements. And you\u2019re supposed to renege on that because your BIL decided on a whim to get married? And he expects you to cancel all of that to accommodate him? He\u2019s the one being grossly entitled. \n\nBut your husband is the biggest AH in this situation. He\u2019s not only failing to support you to his family; he\u2019s actively shit talking you to them. To me, that\u2019s unforgivable behavior. \n\nYou should go to your friend\u2019s wedding and leave your husband at home. He\u2019s going to deliberately make sure you don\u2019t enjoy yourself during what should be a great time. Then he can enjoy his entitled brother\u2019s barbecue.", "NTA why can't you just go to the weddings separately? I understand why that would suck for both of you but it's the simplest solution. I think the reason you are getting Y T A responses is because you said his brother wasn't having a real wedding since it was a backyard BBQ. My partner and I got married in the living room of our 2 bedroom apartment. My dad officiated. We couldn't afford a wedding and were tired of waiting (and unwilling  to go into debt, engaged for 3 years), so we just did it. We have been happily married for 15 years. My wedding was just as real as any other wedding. My marriage is a lot more successful than many people I know. I'm not trying to put anyone down or brag when I say that. I just mean that the wedding is not indicative of martial bliss. There is a compromise here. You just both have to be willing to sacrifice a little.", "NTA\n\nThe other response is so weird.  Yes, the wedding that has been planned for months that you\u2019ve probably already RSVP\u2019d for takes priority.  It\u2019s a huge commitment to be invited to something like this, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money was spent.  Your friend planned ahead and sent invites, this is not the same seriousness as a family BBQ.  His brother is being inconsiderate doing it last minute.  If he wanted everyone to be there he would plan a date far enough out to have notice.", "Nta you go to your friend's wedding take a plus 1 if the friend is fine with it and your husband can go to his brother's, problem solved. \n\nIf i were in your shoes i would go to the friend's wedding. You were looking forward to that trip.", "NTA. These y t a s are wild. Speaking as someone who actually did a backyard wedding (albeit we ordered catering and rented some things), your BIL is wildly inconsiderate in making plans. My spouse and I gave every invitee a list of possible weekends to mark off which ones they could make and well in advance of the actual wedding. We certainly didn't want to make anyone cancel other plans they already made and wanted to make sure they could attend, especially since they are our closest friends and family. Why didn't your BIL ask your husband before making plans? The way your husband instantly caved to his brother makes me wonder about their relationship.", "INFO: Why don't you go to your friends wedding, and your husband goes to his brother's wedding?\n\nIt's understandable for your husband, attending his brother's wedding is his priority over his wife's college friend's wedding. Married people don't have to do everything together. If your husband wants to take the financial loss to be there for his brother, why not? I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time at your friends wedding, catching up with your college friends and enjoying your dream destination post wedding. And solo holidays are so nice, you can truly chill out and do whatever you want to do.", "NTA. You both are adults who can make decisions. You can both go to the specific wedding you want alone without the other. Just cause you are married doesn't make you need to be inseparable and have to do stuff together. Tho I will admit it would be nice to do these kind of things together. Life isn't always gonna work out.  I suggest you tell him you'll be attending your friends and he can come, but if he would rather go to his brothers you'll understand and you can keep the initial plans and let him have his own mini vacation as well. \n\nTho him acting this way and talking bad behind your back needs to stop. The worst and I mean worst thing you can do for a relationship is let others have a say in it and in arguments. \n\nEither way hope you figure it out.", "NTA. You both made a commitment to attend your friend's wedding. You just don't break a prior commitment for anything except an emergency. A conflicting event is not an emergency, no matter how much you might wish to attend it.\n\nIt's not about you; it's not about the destination. It's about you and your husband's integrity and keeping your word.", "NTA - and if BIL wanted his siblings at his wedding, he would have checked if they were free before picking the date. Especially when there\u2019s no limitations on eg Special Venue that only has 1 spare weekend this year. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t BIL check dates with his brother before fixing the date? Does he mind if your husband is there or not?\n\nOr is there any possibility that having the dates clash was intentional? How much does your husband want to go on this particular holiday? Could he be trying to sabotage it?", "Why did the brother book in date without checking to make sure all the important people are available?? If you want your family and closest friends there, you check with them before locking it in.\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA", "Nta. You already rsvpd yes. Even if both weddings were low-key you\u2019ve committed to your friend\u2019s", "NTA. Prior commitment. BIL should have checked in with the main people he wanted at his wedding when he decided on the weekend. Your wording about \u201cnot a real wedding\u201d etc is not cool, but you\u2019re not the AH for wanting BIL to move the date. He wouldn\u2019t be an AH for not moving it either. Your husband is the AH for shit talking you to his family.", "This is why they need to bring back basic Etiquette because anyone who lived through those times *knows* that when you accept the first event invitation it\u2019s extremely poor form to bail on it for another invitation, no matter how much better it may be (although in this case, it is not)", "NTA, but you husband is for not backing you up, and especially for shit talking you. This is a big red flag, and honestly at this point, I\u2019d consider going without him", "Your husband is TAH for talking shit on you this his family. I\u2019d be gone quickly after that tbh", "I\u2019d go to the destination wedding for sure. You\u2019ve had it booked for months.

N T A  for sticking to the prior commitment. But calling BIL\u2019s wedding not a real wedding??

The family will still be disappointed,  but you'll get to go!", "Sorry but you guys have already made a commitment to go and your husband is a ah for talking crap about you petty me would tell him he can go to brothers I\u2019m going to the other since we already said we go", "\"Real\" or not, you had already accepted an invitation; etiquette absolutely forbids you to not attend the event you agreed to, in order to go to a different one. You absolutely must go to the first invitation accepted. You are simply, regretfully, unavailable for any other party at that time. No matter how \"real\".\n\nAnd as to your husband criticizing you to his family, tell him he can go to his brother's wedding, and you'll take a date to your friend's.", "No your husband is this was planned well in advance , its not the end of the world to miss a family wedding . I did not attend my brothers because of circumstances and their was no issue at all . Go to your dream destination with or without your husband .", "NTA You already have plans.  All you need to say is you can't make it.", "NTA go to the wedding. Let your husband go to his brother\u2019s wedding. Him talking shit about you is not ok. You might need marriage counseling.", "You committed to the first wedding. Miss Manners is on your side. NTA.", "Talk to your husband! Tell him you don\u2019t appreciate the way he is bashing you behind your back to his family. His words and actions have caused you pain and discontent. Let him know that you made a commitment before his brother ever set a wedding date and you intend to honor that commitment. Let him know if he doesn\u2019t want to honor his commitment to attend the wedding with you he can stay and attend his brother\u2019s wedding while you attend your friend\u2019s wedding.

Didn\u2019t they already know that you were supposed to be on another destination for a wedding that weekend?

You have a bigger problem than the wedding.", "NTA. You go as planned and your husband can stay home", "NTA. It's been booked, paid for flights, and RSVPd. \nYour husband is a HUGE asshole for not cleaving to his wife and talking about you behind your back. That's the part I'd drag him on.

You have already agreed to the destination wedding so you already have plans. Don't freaking cancel it.", "NTA. My husband and I got married a month after we decided to get married. We knew it was sudden and impromptu. We also didn't take it personally when none of my cousins and only half of our friends could attend. It's a risk you take when you have a sudden wedding. You've already spent the money and had this planned for ages. Frankly, they can't be upset if you can't attend when they chose to have a fast wedding, and your husband honestly also just has to accept that. You already promised to be, and PAID to be, at another wedding.", "NTA go to separate weddings. Your husband is being really basic.", "NTA\n\nYou have a previous commitment. The fact your husband is running to his family and bad-mouthing you is a huge red flag. \n\nTell him you are going to the destination wedding and he can do what he wants.", "NTA\n\nI am getting married and absolutely want my brother and sister to be there. So BEFORE we are setting the final date we will be checking if they can attend that day. If not, than we plan another day.", "Ouch, sorry you are in this situation OP. You are NTAH. \n\nYes, he is your BIL, but you had this destination RSBP'd, budgeted, and everything planned out before your BIL even had the date planned. Your friend's uncle even offered discounts for the rooms, one of which i would assume you reserved. So depending on how far out the wedding is, canceling the reservation may be impossible, and kind of sh*tty, given its the uncle's form of income, and hes already taking a loss on the rooms by lowering the price. If the room cant be filled in before the wedding, he isnt just taking a hit on the room, but losing out completely. \n\nAnd as you said, your BIL had nothing major planned, reserved, or booked for their wedding. Its just a backyard wedding, which arent bad, my mom and dad did that. Whether the date was chosen for a specific reason, idk. The only thing that is kind of an AH move on your part, is saying it isnt a, \"real wedding,\" to begin with. I get what you mean by it, that there is nothing solid with it, and the date can be moved. But it probably could have been said better.\n\nYour husband is the AH though, for talking sh*t about you to his family. I get it is his brother's wedding, and while he doesnt have to agree with you, he shouldnt turn on you like that. He should be trying to find a way everyone is happy.\n\nMy advice, talk to your husband. Tell him you are going to your friend's wedding. You know it is BIL'S wedding, but your friend's has been planned for a longer time, and everything is booked and set. If there is a reason for the date of BIL's wedding, or they just dont want to change it to to ensure your attendance, then he can attend, and you unfortunately wont make it. But if there isnt, and they are willing to change the date because this was RSVP'd well in advance, you would love for your husband to go with you to this wedding. But in the end thid shouldnt be coming between you 2. I wish you luck OP.", "This is a no win situation. There will be disappointment, anger and resentment with both the OP and husband. \nYou made a commitment to one event and both agreed, now the snag.  Another event that changes the dynamics. Shit talking your wife to your \u201cborn\u201d family vs the family you chose to make/have is a major AH move. Calling your BIL\u2019s wedding less important because of location is also an AH thing to say. \nI don\u2019t see any outcome where both parties are happy and this marriage continuing without the three reasons listed above.", "NTA. If it was important to your BIL for you to attend, he would have asked you if his plan conflicted with anything", "NTA. Is there enough time before your solo trip to file for divorce or do you need to wait until you get back? Your husband talking shit is 100% a dealbreaker.", "NRA, your real problem is your husband shit talking you behind your back. Go to the destination wedding by yourself, he can have fun at the barbecue. When you come back have a serious talk about who is the priority, you or his family.", "NTA\n\nYou have longstanding plans on that date.  If your husband will ignore that for his family, maybe he needs a time out.", "NTA. You already have plans.  Maybe let hubby stay home and take a friend instead.", "NTA. I\u2019m a first come first served. If I say I\u2019ll attend something I go to it exceptions being death or serious illness and the likes. You gave your word to your friend and you arranged all this. Seems the brother is doing this deliberately if he knew the dates you were going. Huge red flag is the shit talking to the family. While I believe in venting and having someone to talk to your marriage is you and him and he shouldn\u2019t be shit talking you to them bringing them into this that\u2019s your biggest issue. He doesn\u2019t respect you if he\u2019s doing that.", "NTA. You had RSVP'd prior and made arrangements.

It's possible that BIL did not know or had forgotten about your previous commitment. I understand your husband's POV too.

But by no means should you be pressured to cancel your trip.", "NTA. Prior commitment.

We've been in an arguement about it. I suggested that his brother can just move it to the weekend before or after. They don't have out of town guests, a wedding venue or vendors booked, or anything that would stop them from being able to move it so my husband and I can attend. It's just pure stubbornness. \n\nMy husband isn't backing me up on this at all and has definitely been talking shit to his family about me, which I hate.

It\u2019s a backyard barbecue, so if husband wants to insist they cancel everything, I can see why she would first enquire whether it\u2019s possible to reschedule so that her husband can be at both events. She\u2019s not trying to make this about herself, she\u2019s asking if her BIL would do it for his brother, because she doesn\u2019t want to LOSE MONEY when they\u2019re already struggling financially.

He can stick to your original childcare plans or keep the kids with him. You, however, are keeping your original commitments.\n\nIt might be for the best if you guys take some time away, anyway. Use the time to think. A partner that talks behind your back like that but not to you is not a great one. \n\nIf your bil or husband has an issue, remind them it is an invitation, not a summons. You were given an invitation with more notice and accepted. It is rude to back our last minute, especially with a complicated wedding that the bride and groom need solid counts for. You also budgeted, planned, and put a lot of effort to make this work. If your presence had importance, bil should have checked in when scheduling. Without doing that, he cannot get mad you had a prior commitment \n\nAny problems between bil and husband that result are husband's issue. If husband chooses to come with you, then he needs to stop trashing you because then it's definitely just because he doesn't want to be the bad guy and is settling you up for failure.
