Her uncle owns a resort and has offered amazing discounts on rooms to her guests. We've had this planned for months, RSVP'd, booked a room, arranged childcare, everything. \n\nNow his brother wants to get married the weekend of the wedding. They're not really doing anything, just a quick ceremony and party in my in-law's backyard. It will be more like a family barbecue then any kind of actual wedding. \n\nMy husband wants to cancel everything so we can be in town. I don't want to cancel, for the reasons outlined above. We've been in an arguement about it. I suggested that his brother can just move it to the weekend before or after. They don't have out of town guests, a wedding venue or vendors booked, or anything that would stop them from being able to move it so my husband and I can attend. It's just pure stubbornness. \n\nMy husband isn't backing me up on this at all and has definitely been talking shit to his family about me, which I hate. He thinks I'm being entitled. \n\nIf his brother was having a real wedding that had been planned for months and involved a ton of time/money spent I'd feel differently.

How on earth are you being entitled? You r.s.v.p.\u2019d yes to your friend\u2019s wedding months before your BIL announced his wedding, and your husband went right along with it. You made financial arrangements and have booked child care arrangements. And you\u2019re supposed to renege on that because your BIL decided on a whim to get married? And he expects you to cancel all of that to accommodate him? He\u2019s the one being grossly entitled. \n\nBut your husband is the biggest AH in this situation. He\u2019s not only failing to support you to his family; he\u2019s actively shit talking you to them. To me, that\u2019s unforgivable behavior. \n\nYou should go to your friend\u2019s wedding and leave your husband at home. He\u2019s going to deliberately make sure you don\u2019t enjoy yourself during what should be a great time. Then he can enjoy his entitled brother\u2019s barbecue.", "NTA why can't you just go to the weddings separately? I understand why that would suck for both of you but it's the simplest solution. I think the reason you are getting Y T A responses is because you said his brother wasn't having a real wedding since it was a backyard BBQ. My partner and I got married in the living room of our 2 bedroom apartment. My dad officiated. We couldn't afford a wedding and were tired of waiting (and unwilling  to go into debt, engaged for 3 years), so we just did it. We have been happily married for 15 years. My wedding was just as real as any other wedding. My marriage is a lot more successful than many people I know. I'm not trying to put anyone down or brag when I say that. I just mean that the wedding is not indicative of martial bliss. There is a compromise here. You just both have to be willing to sacrifice a little.", "NTA\n\nThe other response is so weird.  Yes, the wedding that has been planned for months that you\u2019ve probably already RSVP\u2019d for takes priority.  It\u2019s a huge commitment to be invited to something like this, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money was spent.  Your friend planned ahead and sent invites, this is not the same seriousness as a family BBQ.  His brother is being inconsiderate doing it last minute.  If he wanted everyone to be there he would plan a date far enough out to have notice.", "Nta you go to your friend's wedding take a plus 1 if the friend is fine with it and your husband can go to his brother's, problem solved. \n\nIf i were in your shoes i would go to the friend's wedding. You were looking forward to that trip.", "NTA. These y t a s are wild. Speaking as someone who actually did a backyard wedding (albeit we ordered catering and rented some things), your BIL is wildly inconsiderate in making plans. My spouse and I gave every invitee a list of possible weekends to mark off which ones they could make and well in advance of the actual wedding. We certainly didn't want to make anyone cancel other plans they already made and wanted to make sure they could attend, especially since they are our closest friends and family. Why didn't your BIL ask your husband before making plans? The way your husband instantly caved to his brother makes me wonder about their relationship.", "INFO: Why don't you go to your friends wedding, and your husband goes to his brother's wedding?\n\nIt's understandable for your husband, attending his brother's wedding is his priority over his wife's college friend's wedding. Married people don't have to do everything together. If your husband wants to take the financial loss to be there for his brother, why not? I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time at your friends wedding, catching up with your college friends and enjoying your dream destination post wedding. And solo holidays are so nice, you can truly chill out and do whatever you want to do.", "NTA. You both are adults who can make decisions. You can both go to the specific wedding you want alone without the other. Just cause you are married doesn't make you need to be inseparable and have to do stuff together. Tho I will admit it would be nice to do these kind of things together. Life isn't always gonna work out.  I suggest you tell him you'll be attending your friends and he can come, but if he would rather go to his brothers you'll understand and you can keep the initial plans and let him have his own mini vacation as well. \n\nTho him acting this way and talking bad behind your back needs to stop. The worst and I mean worst thing you can do for a relationship is let others have a say in it and in arguments. \n\nEither way hope you figure it out.", "NTA. You both made a commitment to attend your friend's wedding. You just don't break a prior commitment for anything except an emergency. A conflicting event is not an emergency, no matter how much you might wish to attend it.\n\nIt's not about you; it's not about the destination. It's about you and your husband's integrity and keeping your word.", "NTA - and if BIL wanted his siblings at his wedding, he would have checked if they were free before picking the date. Especially when there\u2019s no limitations on eg Special Venue that only has 1 spare weekend this year. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t BIL check dates with his brother before fixing the date? Does he mind if your husband is there or not?\n\nOr is there any possibility that having the dates clash was intentional? How much does your husband want to go on this particular holiday? Could he be trying to sabotage it?", "Why did the brother book in date without checking to make sure all the important people are available?? If you want your family and closest friends there, you check with them before locking it in.\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA", "Nta. You already rsvpd yes. Even if both weddings were low-key you\u2019ve committed to your friend\u2019s", "NTA. Prior commitment. BIL should have checked in with the main people he wanted at his wedding when he decided on the weekend. Your wording about \u201cnot a real wedding\u201d etc is not cool, but you\u2019re not the AH for wanting BIL to move the date. He wouldn\u2019t be an AH for not moving it either. Your husband is the AH for shit talking you to his family.", "This is why they need to bring back basic Etiquette because anyone who lived through those times *knows* that when you accept the first event invitation it\u2019s extremely poor form to bail on it for another invitation, no matter how much better it may be (although in this case, it is not)", "NTA, but you husband is for not backing you up, and especially for shit talking you. This is a big red flag, and honestly at this point, I\u2019d consider going without him", "Your husband is TAH for talking shit on you this his family. I\u2019d be gone quickly after that tbh", "I\u2019d go to the destination wedding for sure. You\u2019ve had it booked for months.

N T A  for sticking to the prior commitment. But calling BIL\u2019s wedding not a real wedding??

The family will still be disappointed,  but you'll get to go!", "Sorry but you guys have already made a commitment to go and your husband is a ah for talking crap about you petty me would tell him he can go to brothers I\u2019m going to the other since we already said we go", "\"Real\" or not, you had already accepted an invitation; etiquette absolutely forbids you to not attend the event you agreed to, in order to go to a different one. You absolutely must go to the first invitation accepted. You are simply, regretfully, unavailable for any other party at that time. No matter how \"real\".\n\nAnd as to your husband criticizing you to his family, tell him he can go to his brother's wedding, and you'll take a date to your friend's.", "No your husband is this was planned well in advance , its not the end of the world to miss a family wedding . I did not attend my brothers because of circumstances and their was no issue at all . Go to your dream destination with or without your husband .", "NTA You already have plans.  All you need to say is you can't make it.", "NTA go to the wedding. Let your husband go to his brother\u2019s wedding. Him talking shit about you is not ok. You might need marriage counseling.", "You committed to the first wedding. Miss Manners is on your side. NTA.", "Talk to your husband! Tell him you don\u2019t appreciate the way he is bashing you behind your back to his family. His words and actions have caused you pain and discontent. Let him know that you made a commitment before his brother ever set a wedding date and you intend to honor that commitment. Let him know if he doesn\u2019t want to honor his commitment to attend the wedding with you he can stay and attend his brother\u2019s wedding while you attend your friend\u2019s wedding.

Didn\u2019t they already know that you were supposed to be on another destination for a wedding that weekend?

You have already agreed to the destination wedding so you already have plans. Don't freaking cancel it.", "NTA. My husband and I got married a month after we decided to get married. We knew it was sudden and impromptu. We also didn't take it personally when none of my cousins and only half of our friends could attend. It's a risk you take when you have a sudden wedding. You've already spent the money and had this planned for ages. Frankly, they can't be upset if you can't attend when they chose to have a fast wedding, and your husband honestly also just has to accept that. You already promised to be, and PAID to be, at another wedding.", "NTA go to separate weddings. Your husband is being really basic.", "NTA\n\nYou have a previous commitment. The fact your husband is running to his family and bad-mouthing you is a huge red flag. \n\nTell him you are going to the destination wedding and he can do what he wants.", "NTA\n\nI am getting married and absolutely want my brother and sister to be there. So BEFORE we are setting the final date we will be checking if they can attend that day. If not, than we plan another day.", "Ouch, sorry you are in this situation OP. You are NTAH. \n\nYes, he is your BIL, but you had this destination RSBP'd, budgeted, and everything planned out before your BIL even had the date planned. Your friend's uncle even offered discounts for the rooms, one of which i would assume you reserved. So depending on how far out the wedding is, canceling the reservation may be impossible, and kind of sh*tty, given its the uncle's form of income, and hes already taking a loss on the rooms by lowering the price. If the room cant be filled in before the wedding, he isnt just taking a hit on the room, but losing out completely. \n\nAnd as you said, your BIL had nothing major planned, reserved, or booked for their wedding. Its just a backyard wedding, which arent bad, my mom and dad did that. Whether the date was chosen for a specific reason, idk. The only thing that is kind of an AH move on your part, is saying it isnt a, \"real wedding,\" to begin with. I get what you mean by it, that there is nothing solid with it, and the date can be moved. But it probably could have been said better.\n\nYour husband is the AH though, for talking sh*t about you to his family. I get it is his brother's wedding, and while he doesnt have to agree with you, he shouldnt turn on you like that. He should be trying to find a way everyone is happy.\n\nMy advice, talk to your husband. Tell him you are going to your friend's wedding. You know it is BIL'S wedding, but your friend's has been planned for a longer time, and everything is booked and set. If there is a reason for the date of BIL's wedding, or they just dont want to change it to to ensure your attendance, then he can attend, and you unfortunately wont make it. But if there isnt, and they are willing to change the date because this was RSVP'd well in advance, you would love for your husband to go with you to this wedding. But in the end thid shouldnt be coming between you 2. I wish you luck OP.", "This is a no win situation. There will be disappointment, anger and resentment with both the OP and husband. \nYou made a commitment to one event and both agreed, now the snag.  Another event that changes the dynamics. Shit talking your wife to your \u201cborn\u201d family vs the family you chose to make/have is a major AH move. Calling your BIL\u2019s wedding less important because of location is also an AH thing to say. \nI don\u2019t see any outcome where both parties are happy and this marriage continuing without the three reasons listed above.", "NTA. If it was important to your BIL for you to attend, he would have asked you if his plan conflicted with anything", "NTA. Is there enough time before your solo trip to file for divorce or do you need to wait until you get back? Your husband talking shit is 100% a dealbreaker.", "NRA, your real problem is your husband shit talking you behind your back. Go to the destination wedding by yourself, he can have fun at the barbecue. When you come back have a serious talk about who is the priority, you or his family.", "NTA\n\nYou have longstanding plans on that date.  If your husband will ignore that for his family, maybe he needs a time out.", "NTA. You already have plans.  Maybe let hubby stay home and take a friend instead.", "NTA. I\u2019m a first come first served. If I say I\u2019ll attend something I go to it exceptions being death or serious illness and the likes. You gave your word to your friend and you arranged all this. Seems the brother is doing this deliberately if he knew the dates you were going. Huge red flag is the shit talking to the family. While I believe in venting and having someone to talk to your marriage is you and him and he shouldn\u2019t be shit talking you to them bringing them into this that\u2019s your biggest issue. He doesn\u2019t respect you if he\u2019s doing that.", "NTA. You had RSVP'd prior and made arrangements.

We've been in an arguement about it. I suggested that his brother can just move it to the weekend before or after. They don't have out of town guests, a wedding venue or vendors booked, or anything that would stop them from being able to move it so my husband and I can attend. It's just pure stubbornness. \n\nMy husband isn't backing me up on this at all and has definitely been talking shit to his family about me, which I hate.

I would have probably done the same, but I would have worn my AH crown like a queen (with a alcoholic beverage on the beach, the kids being with the nanny)", "Dude, she literally said\n\n> If his brother was having a real wedding", "He's TA for trying to stop his wife going when they've had this booked for ages.

OP\u2019s not using \u201creal\u201d to mean \u201cless than\u201d or call the validity of the ceremony into question, she\u2019s very clearly just using \u201creal\u201d as a shorthand way of referring to the fact that it\u2019s not a \u201ctraditional\u201d ceremony. She\u2019s obviously weighing these details up against the amount of money they have already sunk into attending the destination wedding, it\u2019s not about her personal attitude, she\u2019s clearly trying to emphasise why it makes practical sense to either stick to their already booked and paid for vacation and either miss the wedding or see if it can be rescheduled. A short notice barbecue can easily be rescheduled, because it doesn\u2019t involve as many financial or organisational commitments, which I think is the point OP is trying to make, it has nothing to do with being snobbish, OP literally mentioned they have financial difficulties, why would she be snobbish?????

Especially for something last minute.", "If you also ponder what ifs, you will never fully be in the present. This Reality is, she is already booked and busy that day, long before the brother In laws plans. Being flaky is not a good trait, she already RSVP and paid for everything. Most things like that, you can\u2019t get a full refund. Why should she lose money over this. Best situation, she goes without her husband. And let him know just how much money they\u2019ll lose not going", "Intent is more important than words.\n\n\nPeople generally don't say exactly what they mean, because to do so takes a lot of thought and ussually a lot of editing to actually get right.\n\n\nIt's pretty clear here that the word \"real\" that OP used was not refering to the legality of the marriage of the genuineness of couples love. \n\n\nClutching pearl and gasping at the words \"real\" or \"normal\" is just an easy way to implicate people. When really they just mean average or typical or common. \n\n\nWe do this all the time in regular conversation. If you ask for a \"normal coke\", then I know you mean the original flavour (ie not diet, not like etc). I know full well that you aren't denigrating other coke types and I don't ask you to apologise for insinuating that I'm abnormal for ordering diet coke. I have enough awareness to know that language is fluid.\n\n\n\nThe wedding in question is a wedding, but it's not a wedding wedding.", "Sure. But in this case op meamt that they didn't booked a restaurant or something where to have the wedding. If they had, she wouldn't have asked them to move the wedding since it's very difficult to change the date. Now, should they change wedding date? No. Should op go to her bil's wedding? Also no. She already rsvp to her friend's wedding, plus that counts as a vacation too. She can go to her in laws backyard any other time. I honestly think bil and his family are selfish for making op give up a great vacation for a barbecue... c'mon now...let's be real.", "Well if BIL wants his brother to attend he should check in with him first before deciding on a date.", "Still interested personally.", "It is wrong with money and time has already been invested. And you are assuming she isn\u2019t close to the friend. Why would she go to a wedding that requires such planning and consideration if they weren\u2019t close?? The husband can attend the wedding without trying to dictate where OP is.", "Not if they spent a lot of money/planning on it already.", "I think it's not about family but about badmouthing OP for her wish to have long dream vacation instead of backyard barbeque. I'd expect my husband to be supportive or at least civil with me. If not - it's likely worthless relationship.", "Because he's shit-talking her to his family.  Unforgivable.", "A perfectly reasonable solution. Being secure enough to go solo to a wedding is a statement in itself. Anyone would understand that your husband couldn\u2019t miss his brother\u2019s wedding but you still need to honor the plans you made for the college friend. Imagine having a few days where neither of you had to cater to your partner. That is a vacation.", "Not really a fan of destination weddings, but if I ever did decide to go to one and commit to it months ahead of time, I wouldn't drop it for someone's spur of the moment backyard one either.\n\n\nOne is a vacation for me, the other is a barbecue.\n\nDon't get me wrong, both have equal value to the people getting married, but one is a vacation where I spend a couple hours watching someone get married and then I enjoy a vacation.  The other one I give up the vacation in order to stand in a backyard.\n\nI still don't like expecting everyone to spend thousands on travel for a wedding.\n\nNTA", "I disagree.

She\u2019s pointing out facts. Yes, ordinarily it would seem kind of entitled to ask someone to move the date of their wedding. But when it\u2019s a small party, with no real big financial or time commitments that would absolutely prevent rescheduling, it would make sense why you would think that\u2019s a better solution than LOSING MONEY. Especially when this trip is a once in a lifetime opportunity because OP and her husband would not be able to afford it otherwise. They already scheduled childcare, all the financial and time commitments have been made and secured. If that was my sibling, I would *absolutely* reschedule a short notice barbecue wedding for the sake of having them there, and encourage them to stick to their vacation. It has NOTHING to do with snobbishness, and everything to do with being rational and logistical about the circumstances.

Those are just facts. \n\nMe? I would say bye and go to my friends wedding. AH husband with the shit talking can stay home with the kids.", "This. I had people who couldn\u2019t come to my wedding because of other commitments, which was fine by me, but I wasn\u2019t going to change the date of my wedding for two people I\u2019d never met so my in law could have a vacation. \n\nOf course they\u2019d never have asked me to do that.", "Not to mention the \"wedding\" in the title.\n\nIsn't there a statistic that the more expensive the wedding the shorter the marriage?", "Yeah. She comes across as a huge asshole. The contempt she has for this smaller less formal wedding is very icky. \n\nBut she is still somehow NTA because she had an important prior commitment and it\u2019s fair not to cancel.", "I don\u2019t think OP was calling the validity of the marriage into question, it was very clearly just a quick, kind of offhanded way of referring to traditional wedding ceremonies. Lots of people use \u201creal\u201d to refer to \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d, it\u2019s not snobbish, she\u2019s clearly just making the very rational point that there is more leeway in terms of changing the date", "Yeah there you go, it's literally the ceremony.\n\nNotice how there's no extravagance threshold of the \"associated celebrations\".", "The amount of time and money you pour into having your dream wedding has zero relevance to its importance to attendees.", "Oh this is so gross it has to be trolling right?\n\nIf there's a ceremony and a reception and guests and it's a planned event, it's a *wedding* whether it costs $5 and is scheduled two weeks out or $500,000 and scheduled 2 years out.", "The important part is that OP and husband already RSVP\u2018d to the other wedding.", "Is this supporting the brother or the wife?

You always have the right to decline an invitation. You don\u2019t have the right to ask them to move the date. \n\nShe\u2019s not an AH for still wanting to go to the friends wedding. She is one for her entire attitude about her BIL\u2019s wedding. \n\nAnd yes, her snobbishness is showing (though that\u2019s your word as I never actually called her w snob). It\u2019s evident in the way she looks down on the BIL\u2019s wedding as not being \u201cgood enough.\u201d I mean, I didn\u2019t realize she was the dictator of what qualifies as a real wedding and what doesn\u2019t.", "If we'd planned our wedding for a weekend my BIL had already booked an expensive, foreign holiday on I'd definitely be being an asshole. First thing you do with a date is check the availability of your close family.", "\"Real\" and \"common\" and \"traditional\" are three distinct words with three distinct meanings and are not interchangeable.

Why is OP the bad guy for wanting to go to the wedding that has more importance to her?", "I agree with you about the elements that define a wedding.

It\u2019s a lose lose situation", "Exactly! I was wondering if it was deliberate to stir sh!t or keep them (her) away and make her the bad guy. That's why I asked. If bil's wedding  was planned knowing brother and sil had another to go to and it wasn't necessary to pick the same date it seems like a test.\n\nIf I was getting married and there were no issues regarding availability of venues the wedding would not be scheduled when I knew either of my sisters and bils had previously booked going to another wedding.

This is such a common practice, it\u2019s just quick and kind of offhanded, so you don\u2019t have to keep saying \u201ctraditional wedding parties/ceremonies\u201d.\n\nAnd you clearly didn\u2019t read my comment, because your response is ridiculous.

Her husband is refusing to accept her going to the wedding, and is trying to insist that they cancel all the plans. Given all the financial and organisational commitments they have already made, it\u2019s not insane or entitled to ask your husband if his brother will do him the favour of rescheduling, especially since their event is a short notice, small event that doesn\u2019t have the same financial and organisational commitments. It\u2019s a barbecue. I would LOVE that as a wedding, I don\u2019t understand why bringing up that point makes you so sensitive. It\u2019s a practical point. It\u2019s a backyard barbecue, so if husband wants to insist they cancel everything, I can see why she would first enquire whether it\u2019s possible to reschedule so that her husband can be at both events. She\u2019s not trying to make this about herself, she\u2019s asking if her BIL would do it for his brother, because she doesn\u2019t want to LOSE MONEY when they\u2019re already struggling financially. That\u2019s not entitled, she\u2019s not demanding anything, she\u2019s ASKING. You\u2019re clearly too emotionally caught up in word choices to appreciate the practical issues that factor into this situation.\n\nIf it\u2019s not possible to reschedule, then husband has a choice to make. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask your sibling if it\u2019s possible. I would ask my siblings, and I would take them into account for my wedding. But insulting her behind her back to his family is disgusting, and childish, and pathetic, and absolutely would warrant a divorce in my book. Hubby needs to grow up and communicate like an adult, not gossip and whisper about her like a preteen.", "That\u2019s what you do when you want a big shindig. BIL is treating the wedding like a typical backyard bbq with a officiant that will be there. He\u2019s actually downgraded his own wedding. The two should go their separate ways.", "Has anyone asked why it\u2019s this date, or are we just taking OP at her word that BIL is doing this for the sole purpose of screwing with her?", "lmaooooo there's no way you're trying to turn this around. \n\n>which of these wedding**s**  \n>  \n>wanting to go **to the wedding that has** more importance\n\nIt's funny how you adamantly claim in previous comments that BIL's event is \"not a wedding, it's a marriage ceremony\" and then three minutes later post this comment where you indicate that BIL's event *is* in fact a wedding. \n\nThe person you were replying to wasn't saying that OP's the bad guy, dipshit.

It didn't sound like husband had even told his brother they had other commitments already. Frankly it's the husband who's in the wrong. He should have said straight away 'damn, we have flights booked and paid for on that date, sorry bro, is the date set in stone?'.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just pure stubbornness\u201d- or, you know, they didn\u2019t consider his SIL\u2019s vacation when choosing a wedding date.", "The husband is definitely being stubborn."]}
