If I came home one day and my room was straight up demolished and I wasn't even expecting it I'd be a bit crushed and feel unwanted too", "Why do I feel this is punishment for moving in w the bf at 18?", "YTA. Is it your house? Sure. But when college kids say they\u2019re going to visit their parents, they say they\u2019re going HOME. And you took a part of that - her safe space that she grew up in - without so much as a heads up. Just because you CAN, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an AH if you do.", "YTA. Is it that hard to talk with your own kid before doing something drastic? Not even a warning? That's cold.\n\nEdit: this sub isn't \"do I legally have the right?\" Obviously (s)he has the legal right as the owner. It's AITA. Yes, OP is an asshole.", "YTA. 18 is still very young and the chances of things not working out with your daughter's boyfriend are probably pretty high. There is a good chance she will need to leave him and move back home with you. \n\nBy so quickly disappearing her room, especially without any discussion with her, it DOES send the message that you are done with her and don't ever want her to come back. No wonder she is upset. \n\nIt would have been better to wait until she was graduating from college and moving out more permanently.", "YTA. That's cold, man. You didn't think she might wanna come back and stay some times? Just leave forever? Would it have killed you to give her a heads up, prioritizing your kid's feelings above your living room?", "YTA. I haven't visited my family in almost 2 years, but if I went back and they've demolished my room, I'd be heartbroken. she's right, it does make it feel like you just don't want her to move back in ever. You should have at least asked her about it.", "Soft YTA\n\nI don\u2019t think parents realize just how much their kiddos hold onto their childhood homes/rooms sentimentally. This being said, there should have been much more communication over the topic. No, you don\u2019t have to ask her permission to alter anything in your own home. However, she just moved out a few months ago, and a huge change was made to what used to be her space (and what she thought would continue to be her space if she visited/had to move back in), so I can understand her being upset & feeling like she was being disposed of just because she moved out. All around, everyone could\u2019ve had much better communication skills & avoided a whole mess. It is still your home, and she is still your kid. Removing a room won\u2019t ever change that", "You could have told her.", "You could have given her a heads up. Ever thought she was looking forward to sleeping in her room after starting college? Or did you assume she was over you just because she has to move out for school? Demolishing the room isn't such a big deal, but the way you did it, yeah YTA.", "YTA because you were creating facts without including your daughter enough. From your text it sounds like you didn't communicate your plan beforehand. By taking her room in this way you send all the wrong signals. You should have waited longer and told her before demolishing.", "NTA for wanting a bigger living room, or even doing what is best for you now that she has left home.  \n\nBut, YTA for not telling her.  The thing is, the way you did it makes it look bad.  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here, and just look at it like she has started her adult life, so now you can renovate your house how you want.  And that is fine.  But you definitely should have told her before she just came home and was blindsided by it.", "I mean you just bulldozed your daughters childhood safe space, how did you think that would go? Look NTA for wanting more space but have you heard about this new fancy trend called communication...YTA", "YTA - If you love your children and want to see them succeed in life,  then part of that is a transition period where their old life is still there and available to them while they're moving forward into adulthood.  \n\nIt's about giving a fuck about your children and helping them navigate the tumultuous waters of life,  not about ushering them out of the boat and immediately erasing their presence in your home.  \n\nIt's unnecessarily cruel in an already cruel world. It's dismissive and makes your fledgling adult child feel adrift and as though their safe place is no longer an option.  When you feel unwanted and your safe space no longer exists,  you make poor decisions such as staying with a boyfriend longer than you should out of a fear of having nowhere to call home.  \n\nSource: left home at 17, parents erased my existence in the home by repurposing my bedroom as a hobby room with two weeks and told me it was now being used and no longer available to me.  I then moved in with my boyfriend and got pregnant at 21. My daughter is now 18 and wants to move out.  I will hold her room exactly as it is for at least a year (or longer if need be) because she deserves to feel as though she has a safe space that's just for her.  When she's steady and certain as an adult she'll create her own permanent safe space and I can use the room as I see fit. That takes time and patience,  and you'd do it if your kid was a priority.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA- you didn\u2019t kick her out to make the change, she is clearly trying to make it on her own and has a stable place to stay with her boyfriend. Thinking that parents have to keep their children\u2019s rooms \u201cjust in case\u201d is pure entitlement. I can understand why she\u2019s upset, I would be too, but at the same time, my parents worked hard to buy their home and ultimately it\u2019s their decision as to what happens with it.", "YTA. As an 18yo you are at an immensely fragile part of your life. You're taking your first steps into true adulthood. Being able to do that with a feeling of a safety net is so important. It allows you to take those risks, and learn as you go, and make your way through your failures.\n\nKnowing that you have a home base, a safe space to return to, a permanent foothold in this world with your parents, is a huge psychological aid.\n\nYour bedroom at your parents house is that kind of place. It's a place with huge sentimentality attached. A safe space that sheltered you through your teenage years. When you're out learning to navigate the often scary difficulties of the adult world, knowing that you can go back to that place is very stabilizing.\n\nYou demolished that. Her safe space in your home, a place of huge sentimental value, symbolic of the support you, as parents, provide to her? Totally gone, without the slightest chance for her to mentally prepare herself for it. \n\nBy demolishing that room you are saying to her \"we will no longer provide you with a safe place to return to, only the kind of impersonal aid she shouldn't depend on.", "NTA but I'm from Europe, so I might be biased. My parents did kind of the same thing, when I moved out to study in a different city. And I get it. They needed more space, my bedroom was empty. If I wanted to sleep there, I'm always welcome.", "You assumed that her living arrangement would be permanent. What if they break up? Where will she go? Oh, to a sofa with no privacy. YTA because now your daughter will feel pressured to stay in this relationship because there is no safe space for her to retreat to. She's still just 18 with no personal means of support.", "Lol YTA how can you do that to her room without telling her, she grew up in that room!!", "Why would you not communicate this with her? That's what makes you in the wrong. YTA.", "YTA. You should have talked to her first at the very least.\n\nIt's absolutely a symbolic gesture to keep a room in your parent/s home. Only you didn't just adapt it for a study/another use, you actively destroyed it. \n\nEvery adult child I've known whose parents did this has a fraught relationship with them", "YTA if nothing else at least for the lack of communication.\n\nIt is your home but she's right, if you never want her to spend a night there you did just the right thing to achieve that. Because relationships when you are 18 never end right? And please, sleeping on the couch in the living room is NOT even remotely the same as knowing that you have a place to go if you need one. You are a crappy parent.", "NTA \nUnpopular opinion but: \n\nWhat's up with all these adults making adult decisions, like moving in with partners, assuming the bedroom they left will never be touched?\n\nYes, your daughter is in college but she still decided to move out. And that's part of life. There should never be an expectation that mom and dad will keep your bedroom indefinitely, or even until 26. \n\nAnd when mom and dad own the house, they shouldn't have to run every decision by their adult children. \n\nAlso, you changed your house's layout after your daughter chose to move out, you didn't kick her out and while she no longer has a room she still has the ability to come home. Only now there is a bit of an incentive for her to get up on her feet and get her own place so she can have privacy if she ever does and up back home", "Lmao these people are fucked. NTA. It\u2019s your house. You don\u2019t answer to your kid. Didn\u2019t know she paid the mortgage.", "YTA.

Nothing wrong with that at all. She\u2019s probably reacting the way she is because she may be feeling some anxiety about the future. Shame may have been mentally banking on your house as a safe retreat if the boyfriend and college situations take a wrong turn. Being on your own in the big, wide world can seem scary.

It's your house to remodel as you will, but it's her bedroom, her safe space, her association with sentiments and safety and childhood memories. And you erased it, which I'm sure she sees as you erasing existence from the family. The shock must've hurt.\n\nThe couch isn't exactly a bedroom. No privacy. Not the same memories. And if you want to watch TV, will you leave so she can sleep?", "why didn\u2019t you just TELL HER????", "NTA, but you probably should have told her what was happening beforehand.", "YTA for not even giving her a heads up", "NTA for the renovation. YTA for not telling her about it. You erased her from your home. That deserves some warning.", "I'm going to enrage both sides here.\n\nDaughter is NOT an AH for ... what? Being emotional? People have a right to feel what they feel, and to *express* those feelings to their parents. She didn't say anything insulting, she didn't scream and rage. Every n t a vote on here is accusing the daughter of being an AH for... having feelings and talking to her parents about it. That's absurd.\n\nBut... I don't think this was an AH move, just... really thoughtless.\n\nYes, OP, it's your home and she's an adult living elsewhere. You have a legal right to change it however you want.\n\nShe's not just in school, she moved in with her boyfriend. And I can see why that would feel like a mile marker for you. \n\nBut... she's a teenager in college. It's possible that she's looking at *any* living arrangements right now as sort of ... temporary. Just like it is for all the kids her age who \"moved in\" to college dorms.\n\nEven if she didn't, it's not uncommon for people to want to \"say goodbye\" to their childhood home, or their childhood bedroom. \n\nRenovations take a lot of time... did you not speak to your child at all before or during (or even after?) the reno... so that she had to come home and see it?\n\nWere you wanting to surprise her thinking she'd be impressed/congratulate you? I know a lot of people like to surprise relatives this way... probably not appropriate for the person whose space it was...\n\nBut... \n\nLook, a lot of the comments are mentioning a \"safe space\". And I think that's the main issue here. Kids need to be able to physically explore the world, knowing their parents are there to catch them if they fall. That need *lessens* as they grow older, but it doesn't just disappear the day they turn 18 or move out. And while your daughter is legally/technically an adult... she's still your child. She's still new at this. And she needs to know you'll be there for her if something goes wrong.\n\nIf this had been a conversation, like... \"we're so proud of you, and we're glad you're able to be on your own\" and then talking about wanting to open up the space, but assuring her she could come back... she still would probably have been upset about losing \"her room\". But she would have known you were still thinking of her, and felt safer.\n\nThis way, she saw that you'd destroyed her safe space, and then you said she could come back *after* she got upset about it. It's going to feel like you forgot about her.\n\nI don't think it was an AH move. I think it was thoughtless, because it wasn't *thoughtful*.\n\nIt's not about whether or not you were an AH... you *hurt* your child. And she needs reassurance, not righteousness.\n\nNAH, but maybe talk with her.", "Are you mute? Do your phones not work? You couldn't bother giving her a call and asking?\n\nYTA", "Nah, that's your house. You don't answer to your kid on that front.\n\nEdit- I'll add this. You might not be the asshole but was it a wise move to do it so soon? Or at all? Her and her boyfriend could break up in the next 20 minutes. Then your new living room becomes her living space? \n\nAlso, you may have devalued your home.

There is a couch in there with a pull-out bed, and if my daughter needs to spend the night at our house, that is what she uses. There is no expectation to keep a room at the ready for an adult child who has already moved out.", "YTA, not once did you think to update her about what was happening? that makes me think that you knew she would be upset and purposefully avoided telling her, which makes me think you know youre in the wrong. did you not expect her to be devastated that her comfort space was demolished and that she would react negatively to being surprised by that?\n\ngeeze and all you have to offer is a couch if she decides to visit for an extended break, or god forbid she's forced out of her living situation and needs an emergency stay for more than 3 days. not a lot of foresight on this one...", ">our tiny living room\n\nResources are limited, so I understand why you'd want this.\n\nHowever, it is rough on a kid when that happens:\n\n>18 yr old daughter\n\nWe all know that is mostly an adult in just the letter of the law.

Student housing is relativelly short term. \n\nAlso, moving out for the first time is scary. She'll still need you and knowing a home waits for her if she needs it makes a big difference. But I can understand understand why you'd do what you did when you're house is so small.\n\n>When my daughter came home to visit and saw that her room is gone\n\nThis is what makes YTA. This should never have been a surprise. She came home and the place she thought she could feel save and rest after the hectic time that starting college is was gone. Of course she felt wholly and uterly rejected by you. Your claim she would always be welcome should've been the first thing you said in the confersation you should've had with her before starting this project.\n\nAlso, unless she took literally every object that could be considered hers from the room, I don't blame her for thinking it was still considered hers.", "NTA.

She should be glad the hone is still there, instead of you having to relocate to a better arrangement. \n\nIt might feel like an abandonment, a betrayal, but it's time for her to be realistic.

You are so disconnected from your own child you don\u2019t even see the relevance her room held for her for so long.", "Yeah YTA. She is barely an adult, just moved out and you erased the home and safe space she knew from existence and if she needs that home she is now a guest. The speed suggests you could not wait to get her out of the house, that she was a burden for taking up space in your house. That is rough. You could have communicated it, let her get used to the idea.", "YTA.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t even tell her? And she\u2019s barely an adult, what the hell is she gonna do if this relationship doesn\u2019t work out?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to keep the room.

Well then, why would you not do the same for her? You went months without telling her what was happening in your home, to her room, and to her stuff. That's a deliberate choice and then you want to appear shocked she would be upset. \n\nIf your daughter ran off and got married, moved states, or had an entire child without telling you, I imagine you would be upset...do you have the brain capacity to translate that in to how you made her feel?", "YTA.

Many people take poorly to this kind of change.", "YTA for not warning her.\n\nNTA for doing the renovation.\n\nYou pulled her security blanket away.  You metaphorically removed her from her home.  Of course she's upset.\n\nBoth my kids are grown and they've been gone for about 10 years.  And the ONLY reason that I have been able to tinker with their bedrooms is that we have a history of moving the kids into different spaces as they grew up. For example, when we had my son's buddy living with us for a while, the rec room became their shared bedroom.  We constantly adapted the house to suit what we needed.\n\nSo when I say \"You can always come home\" they KNOW that our house will immediately be adapted to whatever we need to accommodate them.  We have a history of this, and they trust it.  They feel like they always have a safe, secure, place for themselves, and we will immediately welcome them and adapt.\n\nYou don't have that history.  And you wiped out her only space without warning her.  I don't blame her for being upset.", "Yta like wow u must not really care", "NTA\n\nShe's not in a dorm, she moved out.

Similar for most of my friends. Also a very common thing here where I live is that when the kids move out the parents move apartments and downsize (because it's cheaper). Owning a home is not common here, renting is the norm so often parents will move into a 2 room apartment once the last kid moved out. Nobody would really expect their parents to keep their childhood room, pay for it and not use it. \n\nYou could have told her beforehand but if you didn't see why it would be an issue I also can see why you would not think of discussing it with her first.", "YTA.

Their bedroom is their sanctuary. You took home away from them, it'll never be the same now.", "YTA. How is it that your plans to renovate your home never came up in everyday conversation with your daughter? I have a suspicion that you intentionally hid this information from her because you suspected that she wouldn't like the idea, even though it's your house and you're entitled to do whatever you want with it.

Am I supposed to keep a spare bedroom in my house that could be usable space indefinitely on the chance he needs it?  My son is came back for a few months and slept on the couch downstairs.

But at the same time, it is your house and I'm sure this was a something youve been waiting for for a while, as a small living room when there is relatively unused space is annoying and I get why you'd want a bigger living room.

Not everyone lives in a huge house with rooms to spare.\n\nBut the lack of communication about it is wild. To not even give her a chance to visit to say goodbye to her old room? Insane.

The older of the two youngest is turning 14, and even though they don't seem to mind too much about sharing with their 11-year-old sibling, I can see that it's time to allow them their own space.\n\nCase in point: Even I know that removing a child's \"safe\" space at home requires a tender touch.  You're not a bad parent for wanting to do a home remodel, YTA for not realizing that your child still considers their old bedroom as a safe space, a place of refuge if things go wrong and they want to come home.

Having parents that love, support you and would have you back with open arms is a privilege that not many people have especially after turning 18.  If she thinks that being wanted around is equated to no longer having a room in a place that she no longer lives then she will be learning a lot of things the hard way.

Any number of things can happen because she's a kid in an adult body that our society has agreed is old enough for fend for herself. But few 18 year olds are.

Since you didn\u2019t even talk to her, what did you do with everything?  Did you take the time to actually carefully box up her memories?  Or is everything just tossed in boxes randomly?  What did you  with what clothes were left?

Even if she wants to visit for a couple of days or she and her boyfriend break up and she needs a place to stay for a bit, she doesn't really have a place there anymore. The room she grew up in has been destroyed and her only alternative is the couch, which is neither welcoming nor does it offer the same sense of security. The message that the daughter has received is \"once you're gone, you're gone for good\" which is entirely unsupportive.\n\nI agree with you here.

I guess i just always thought that parents were supposed to care for their kid a bit more than that.\n\nIts not having her perfect room uwu its she is literally 18 and moved in with her boyfriend, it probably wont work. And even if it does, what if something else happens? Im not saying they are supposed to never change it but can she have a few years to actually get a life going with a safety net?

A decade ago, when I moved out of my parents house at 18 my dad immediately (within a year) took over my old room and made it into a man cave where he has all of his hobbies and whatnot in there.

My bf was upset his mom asked him to clean out his stuff when he went to visit a few years ago because she was thinking about selling it. He wanted her to just continue storing it.

Everyone else in these comments are talking about this as if their daughter was 25 and moved out of state or something.", "i feel like people are missing the part where the room was left empty when she moved out, do they expect OP to keep an empty room available for their daughter to moved back into in the case that her relationship and college goals fall apart?", "Yeah. This feels very deliberate like a punishment.", "Yeah where is her furniture? Did they just throw it all out? Did they offer it to her for her and her bf\u2019s apartment? (and if so wouldn\u2019t the renovation come up?)", "Literally just communicate with her beforehand so she has a heads up.", "Fair. And I'm not as singing blame to her, to be honest. Just have more questions than I have answers for. \n\nOut of state made a little less sense to me, as the parent said \"she moved in with her bf\", meaning he likely already had an established place, which would more than likely be local, not at the very college she went for. \n\nIf they went off to college together, they would have said \"they moved in together\" usually. And so if it's local, it would be strange that she never stopped by and saw the gaping hole where her bedroom used to be. But yeah, if she was out of state or even just hours away, that would make sense why she hadn't been by sooner.\n\nI'm a little curious what the actual time it took from move-out to renovation completion was.", "I'm from Spain and American culture regarding family seems wild to me. \n\n\nI'm a 35yo woman who have been living away from home for ages (even a decade abroad): it still took me years to convince my mum to get rid of my teenager furniture. She only agreed to get rid of it recently, after our daughter was born and it was clear that having an empty room with a double bed was way more practical for any impromptu visit. \n\n\nShe still refers to the room as \"my room\", same with my brother's (who is also living away for years now). No matter how much we try to convince her to turn them into something else, she refuses. \"What if you needed to come back home?\". She doesn't even mean my brother and me, she means our partners (&kids) too. \n\n\nFor a Spanic mum, having room for your kids (literally) always takes precedence over other \"superfluous\" needs. \n\n\nI don't *need* a room at her house, but knowing I will always be welcomed in a heartbeat makes me feel loved and extremely grateful. No matter how sudden my need is, she has my back.", "I think most people expect the literal walls to continue to exist when they leave for a few months at 18", "I completely agree. Why should they not do what they want with their own home just on the chance she comes back for more than a few days at a time?", "Yeah I don't get it when I moved out when I went to college not a dorm but am apartment my parents renovationed my and my older sisters room into a gaming/theater room. If the daughter was in college living in a dorm it would be Y T A but she's not NTA.", "I \ud83d\udcafagree. My parents changed my bedroom into an office pretty much the day after I moved out - so they didn\u2019t have to use the living/dining room as an office. I never thought twice about it - but they told me about it before they even did it and didn\u2019t blindside me with it when I came to visit.", "Exactly!", "My parents got a new shed and I got emails beforehand about it, multiple videos of it being installed as well as FaceTiming as the truck backed it in. I haven\u2019t lived at their house in 11 years.", "That is an incredibly unreasonable take to form from this post and you're most likely projecting here.", "Nope. OP YTA.", "Yeah I think OP isn't being entirely honest. A major reason why this sub is a problem you only get one side. And even in the rosey picture OP posted she doesn't sound great. Like did you not think for even moment that your daughter might like a place to sleep when they came to visit? \n\n\nI would honestly have the same reaction as the daughter. Every sign of pointing to OP essentially saying \"and stay out!\"", "I for one think that OP was glad to get rid of their daughter.. they jumped on the opportunity to make their living room \u201cnormal size\u201d as soon as they got the chance.", "THIS. THIISSSS. I am really having an issue understanding people thinking this was a YTA move? Is the daughter on the mortgage? Is she contributing towards the mortgage payments? no? then.... sounds like the people who live there FULL TIME wanted more spacious living, and guess what, they're the mortgage holders so. I am failing to see an issue here. I guess being able to have an empty room with no one using it is a privilege? I already have a plan for when the daughters move out because guess what - they will live elsewhere and this is a building I am responsible for and I will use the empty space as I see fit - and they're always welcome to come back and we will figure it out at that time only. Rooms as shrines indefinitely is so bizarre to me.", "100% with you. People on reddit are babies apparently.", "I scrolled through way too much nonsense to get to this NTA. Crazy stuff.", "Sounds like the relationship is going to be forever now, because her parents helpfully took away her last options.", "She's literally 18 and hasn't been gone for a year, and there are so many things that could happen that would cause her to need somewhere safe to come home to. Now she can't, and the parents chose having a more spacious living room over a safety net for their daughter, that is pretty likely to be needed at least once over the course of college.", "Thats why I made the differentiation between them in the last paragraph.\n\nThe daughter knew her room wasn't going to be there acter ahe moved out.\n\n But she was shocked that it was demolished."]}
