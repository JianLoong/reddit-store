Hiram wrote down that he was allergic to mushrooms, which I know for a fact he is not. He just doesn't like them.\n\nI understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food, but I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies. These types of allergies can be life-threatening and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, I decided to write to the wedding party, letting them know that Hiram wasn't actually allergic to mushrooms and asked them to ignore his instructions.\n\nThe wedding was last weekend, and they ended up serving mushrooms as a big part of his vegetarian option and he was really angry with me when he found out what I did. He couldn't eat much of what was on offer and felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of our friends and family when they asked why he wasn't eating. I can understand why he would feel that way, but I stand by my decision. I don't think it's okay to lie about having an allergy just to avoid certain foods.\n\nI've apologized to Hiram and we've talked about the situation, but I can't shake off the feeling that I did the right thing. I don't want to be the type of person who stands by and lets others lie and be disrespectful, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: Last weekend was not *our* wedding - it was the wedding of two friends.", "created_utc": 1674939866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10npisv/aita_for_correcting_my_partners_meal_restrictions/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mushrooms are so common in vegetarian dishes because they're easy protein. You intentionally went behind his back when you could have just asked why he did it.

He didn't want to  have mushrooms because he dislikes them, and as a result of your actions, he ended up not being able to eat very much or enjoy his meal because there were mushrooms in it.\n\nI think you overreacted. It was a dietary requirements form. Hiram doesn't like mushrooms and maybe indicated he was allergic so that his particular dietary requirement would be respected.

He shouldn't be embarassed he doesn't like mushrooms, he should be embarrassed he's a liar. The \"what's the harm\" is so irritating because 1) if he actually was allergic, they would have to change the entire meal for one person, 2) if he actually was allergic, the catering company would have had to make sure there was no cross-contanimation.

Hiram wrote down that he was allergic to mushrooms, which I know for a fact he is not. He just doesn't like them.\n\nI understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food, but I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies. These types of allergies can be life-threatening and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, I decided to write to the wedding party, letting them know that Hiram wasn't actually allergic to mushrooms and asked them to ignore his instructions.\n\nThe wedding was last weekend, and they ended up serving mushrooms as a big part of his vegetarian option and he was really angry with me when he found out what I did. He couldn't eat much of what was on offer and felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of our friends and family when they asked why he wasn't eating. I can understand why he would feel that way, but I stand by my decision. I don't think it's okay to lie about having an allergy just to avoid certain foods.\n\nI've apologized to Hiram and we've talked about the situation, but I can't shake off the feeling that I did the right thing. I don't want to be the type of person who stands by and lets others lie and be disrespectful, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
