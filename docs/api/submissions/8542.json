Hiram wrote down that he was allergic to mushrooms, which I know for a fact he is not. He just doesn't like them.\n\nI understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food, but I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies. These types of allergies can be life-threatening and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, I decided to write to the wedding party, letting them know that Hiram wasn't actually allergic to mushrooms and asked them to ignore his instructions.\n\nThe wedding was last weekend, and they ended up serving mushrooms as a big part of his vegetarian option and he was really angry with me when he found out what I did. He couldn't eat much of what was on offer and felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of our friends and family when they asked why he wasn't eating. I can understand why he would feel that way, but I stand by my decision. I don't think it's okay to lie about having an allergy just to avoid certain foods.\n\nI've apologized to Hiram and we've talked about the situation, but I can't shake off the feeling that I did the right thing. I don't want to be the type of person who stands by and lets others lie and be disrespectful, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: Last weekend was not *our* wedding - it was the wedding of two friends.", "created_utc": 1674939866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10npisv/aita_for_correcting_my_partners_meal_restrictions/", "score": 3441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mushrooms are so common in vegetarian dishes because they're easy protein. You intentionally went behind his back when you could have just asked why he did it.

Hiram wrote down that he was allergic to mushrooms, which I know for a fact he is not. He just doesn't like them.\n\nI understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food, but I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies. These types of allergies can be life-threatening and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, I decided to write to the wedding party, letting them know that Hiram wasn't actually allergic to mushrooms and asked them to ignore his instructions.\n\nThe wedding was last weekend, and they ended up serving mushrooms as a big part of his vegetarian option and he was really angry with me when he found out what I did. He couldn't eat much of what was on offer and felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of our friends and family when they asked why he wasn't eating. I can understand why he would feel that way, but I stand by my decision. I don't think it's okay to lie about having an allergy just to avoid certain foods.\n\nI've apologized to Hiram and we've talked about the situation, but I can't shake off the feeling that I did the right thing. I don't want to be the type of person who stands by and lets others lie and be disrespectful, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, you went behind his back and did embarass him. If there had been an option for strong food aversion he might have been able to use that instead. Would you have also done this if he were Jewish/Muslim and marked down pork and shellfish as allergies with no option to mark kosher/halal?", "YTA. Some people have mild dislikes for certain foods and some others really can\u2019t even stand meals prepared with those foods. Maybe Hiram is one of the latter and it\u2019s awful to not be able to eat at an event. I understand this was a lie but it wasn\u2019t hurting anyone.

Was he \u201cwrong\u201d to list them as an allergy\u2026yea but it also sounds like a lot of people are unaware of how to list food sensitivities. Maybe she could of explained that to him but no straight behind his back. Basically tells his friends that he\u2019s a liar and disregard his preferences.

You are because rather than keeping your mouth shut and talking to your fiance about it you went and back stabbed him by saying he wasn't. The wedding party is because it seems they maliciously made his meal mostly out of the thing he doesn't like. How would they feel if they didn't like a food and some intentionally made a meal focused around it.\n\nIf I were your fiance I'd be giving this relationship a serious reevaluation to see if I could be with someone who treated me with such a large amount of disrespect", "YTA not because you did it, I get it I\u2019ve worked a lot as a cook and a server and it is annoying when people lie about that type of stuff.

I can see where you are coming from but I can also see that you have no clue what it is like to go somewhere and not be able to eat anything because each dish is made with an ingredient that you despise.\nI hate mushrooms with a passion and sadly a lot of dishes have mushroom as a main ingredient. Most places don't care if you don't like something when it comes to preregistering specific needs/wants so the only way around it is lie. I usually also lie about being vegetarian because I hate fish and don't eat most meats.\nThose foods make me actively sick, but because it's nor an allergy people don't care. But like I said I know where you are coming from, allergies can be horrible and can require the personal to prepare stuff seperatly which can be an immense hassle.\n\nYour behaviour was still horribly rude. Why couldn't you just talk to your partner about it? You could have contacted the wedding party to ask if the meals will be mushroom heavy and then just ordered a pizza for him before or asked if he could warm up some prepped food.\nInstead you went out of your way to ridicule him.", "This was shady as fuck.

They'll try to convince you to try \"the meaty portobello\" or \"the delicate morelle\" or they'll take it upon themselves to sneak them into your food in some misguided attempt to prove to you that your own tastes are just wrong. It's obnoxious, and it pushes people (like me) to lie. (Sometimes you don't want to have an argument just to get a dinner you can stand to eat.)\n\nI know about the whole kitchen protocol thing \u2014 but, again, some of us have just been pushed to the mushroom allergy lie. Personally, I stand by it as a tactic.\n\nYTA", "YTA. This kind of situation is why people tell those lies", "Hiram may have a reason for hating mushrooms. He clearly won't eat them. It may not be an anaphylactic allergy, it could be a food that he knows will make him sick.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience here - that's how I am with tomatoes. They don't make me break out in hives or cause my throat to swell, but tomatoes *will* make me strap myself to a toilet for an hour and cause me to be a walking gas canister, and I hate it. It's embarrassing and it detracts from me being able to enjoy myself. I have to tell people that it's an allergy because otherwise I get hit with \"you just don't like it\" as food with tomato is shoved in my face.\n\nThis reads to me like Hiram is that way with mushrooms. They may not make him need an EpiPen, but instead they make him sick. He doesn't want to be sick at a wedding. To avoid everything, he just says that has has a mushroom allergy. It's way easier to explain and conveys the same message - he can't eat mushrooms.\n\nFor you to go behind your back and do that was childish, petty, and lowkey power trippy, and might I add:\n\n>I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies\n\n**STOP BEING A FUCKING WHITE KNIGHT**. I guarantee you anyone who goes into anaphylactic shock due to mushrooms *will not give a flying, swimming, or walking FUCK* that Hiram listed a mushroom allergy to avoid being served a food that makes him sick.

But seriously it just seems like you wanted to humiliate him.", "Honestly.... I can't sympathize with you.\n\nYeah, it's lame to lie about allergens, but you know why people do it? Because they get sick of foodservice workers ignoring or forgetting a legitimate request because it wasn't written in bold enough marker. This happens all the time to people with legitimate issues like diabetes or lactose intolerance where a simple order becomes an hours long ordeal because someone was forgetful or in some cases outright a spiteful asshole.\n\nFine, he isn't \"allergic\" to mushrooms, but he may as well be given how he basically ate nothing thanks to you. They included mushrooms because you went behind his back on the basis of \"virtues\" and didn't even have the good decency to simply say **no mushrooms.**\n\nThis wasn't even disrespectful either, this falls into the territory of \"white lies\" which every one, including yourself, tells. Hell, as you didn't tell him you did this you were genuinely acting in a deceitful fashion so frankly how are you any better.

If my partner went over my head and told someone to ignore my strong aversion to cilantro like I was a difficult, picky toddler who needs to taught a lesson, I'd be humiliated beyond belief.

Because people lie and say they\u2019re allergies when they\u2019re aversions, kitchen staff don\u2019t take allergy requests as seriously as they need to be taken. And on and on it goes. It\u2019s a cycle that needs to be broken.\n\nI worked in a quick service style location once. We had a policy if someone wanted something left out; we asked if it was allergy or preference. We assured them that we would leave it out either way if we could (if it wasn\u2019t something already in premade food). But an allergy meant that culinary would need to be instructed by the head chef on how to properly cook it to avoid cross contamination (there was always supervision even if it was only over the phone, kind of a weird situation that\u2019s hard to explain), whereas a preference it would just be made the same but whatever it was would be left off. \n\nAnd it was in the food safety training we did (across property, not just my location) about how to handle these requests. Because people were encouraged to be honest about if it was preference or allergy with the understanding that if it was preference it would still be honored (if it could be), people weren\u2019t inclined to lie. Since that meant culinary didn\u2019t have to go through allergy procedure every time someone wanted something left off, they took it very, _very_ seriously when they did.\n\nIt\u2019s really not _that_ hard to break the cycle but for some reason not enough places have figured it out yet.\n\nETA: and to be clear, I don\u2019t say my aversions are allergies when they\u2019re not.

The manager apologized profusely and had it remade properly and it took 20 minutes for it to come out. Everyone was done at that point so we had it boxed.
