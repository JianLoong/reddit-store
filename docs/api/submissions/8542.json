Hiram wrote down that he was allergic to mushrooms, which I know for a fact he is not. He just doesn't like them.\n\nI understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food, but I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies. These types of allergies can be life-threatening and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, I decided to write to the wedding party, letting them know that Hiram wasn't actually allergic to mushrooms and asked them to ignore his instructions.\n\nThe wedding was last weekend, and they ended up serving mushrooms as a big part of his vegetarian option and he was really angry with me when he found out what I did. He couldn't eat much of what was on offer and felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of our friends and family when they asked why he wasn't eating. I can understand why he would feel that way, but I stand by my decision. I don't think it's okay to lie about having an allergy just to avoid certain foods.\n\nI've apologized to Hiram and we've talked about the situation, but I can't shake off the feeling that I did the right thing. I don't want to be the type of person who stands by and lets others lie and be disrespectful, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: Last weekend was not *our* wedding - it was the wedding of two friends.", "created_utc": 1674939866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10npisv/aita_for_correcting_my_partners_meal_restrictions/", "score": 598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mushrooms are so common in vegetarian dishes because they're easy protein. You intentionally went behind his back when you could have just asked why he did it.

Hiram wrote down that he was allergic to mushrooms, which I know for a fact he is not. He just doesn't like them.\n\nI understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to food, but I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies. These types of allergies can be life-threatening and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, I decided to write to the wedding party, letting them know that Hiram wasn't actually allergic to mushrooms and asked them to ignore his instructions.\n\nThe wedding was last weekend, and they ended up serving mushrooms as a big part of his vegetarian option and he was really angry with me when he found out what I did. He couldn't eat much of what was on offer and felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of our friends and family when they asked why he wasn't eating. I can understand why he would feel that way, but I stand by my decision. I don't think it's okay to lie about having an allergy just to avoid certain foods.\n\nI've apologized to Hiram and we've talked about the situation, but I can't shake off the feeling that I did the right thing. I don't want to be the type of person who stands by and lets others lie and be disrespectful, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Some people have mild dislikes for certain foods and some others really can\u2019t even stand meals prepared with those foods. Maybe Hiram is one of the latter and it\u2019s awful to not be able to eat at an event. I understand this was a lie but it wasn\u2019t hurting anyone. Sound like you felt like the allergy police which I don\u2019t really get why.", "I\u2019m sorry but I hope Hiram do not make it down the aisle. Was he \u201cwrong\u201d to list them as an allergy\u2026yea but it also sounds like a lot of people are unaware of how to list food sensitivities. Maybe she could of explained that to him but no straight behind his back. Basically tells his friends that he\u2019s a liar and disregard his preferences. Are you planning on telling him what to eat, how to act and god knows what else you\u2019ll want to control for the rest of his life. You my dear are an absolutely an AH!!", "Yta, you went behind his back. It's not cool. I will not judge your partner, because it's not sbout him", "Unfortunately I have to go YTA. \n\nIt would have been better to just have a chat with your partner about his lie and that in future you would prefer he didn't go to such extents to avoid food he doesn't like. \n\nI feel his consequence of being embarrassed and caught out over a white lie did not fit his crime.", "YTA- you should have minded your own business and not got involved. \n\nPeople can suddenly develop non-fatal allergies and food intolerances.", "YTA. I hate mushrooms. Whenever I\u2019d go somewhere and order something with no mushrooms it was a 50/50 toss up on if they\u2019d listen or not and I\u2019d end up picking mushroom bits out of my meal for 5-10 minutes before I could eat it. Now I tell them I\u2019m allergic and I get my food correct the first time and get to enjoy my meal. YTA.", "YTA you humiliated him and also in the past have defied his boundaries, he doesn't like mushrooms that's not for you to overrule ever", "YTA and to a minor degree so is the wedding party. You are because rather than keeping your mouth shut and talking to your fiance about it you went and back stabbed him by saying he wasn't. The wedding party is because it seems they maliciously made his meal mostly out of the thing he doesn't like. How would they feel if they didn't like a food and some intentionally made a meal focused around it.\n\nIf I were your fiance I'd be giving this relationship a serious reevaluation to see if I could be with someone who treated me with such a large amount of disrespect", "YTA not because you did it, I get it I\u2019ve worked a lot as a cook and a server and it is annoying when people lie about that type of stuff. Plus it would have really restricted the veggie options for all the other vegetarian guests so I get that. You are the asshole because you did it behind his back like a snake. He went hungry and was embarrassed because he was blindsided by your underhanded ness, I would have been furious with you too.", "YTA. I can see where you are coming from but I can also see that you have no clue what it is like to go somewhere and not be able to eat anything because each dish is made with an ingredient that you despise.\nI hate mushrooms with a passion and sadly a lot of dishes have mushroom as a main ingredient. Most places don't care if you don't like something when it comes to preregistering specific needs/wants so the only way around it is lie. I usually also lie about being vegetarian because I hate fish and don't eat most meats.\nThose foods make me actively sick, but because it's nor an allergy people don't care. But like I said I know where you are coming from, allergies can be horrible and can require the personal to prepare stuff seperatly which can be an immense hassle.\n\nYour behaviour was still horribly rude. Why couldn't you just talk to your partner about it? You could have contacted the wedding party to ask if the meals will be mushroom heavy and then just ordered a pizza for him before or asked if he could warm up some prepped food.\nInstead you went out of your way to ridicule him.", "This was shady as fuck. YTA\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen lots of comments from service staff and I agree that it wasn\u2019t okay for Hiram to put them through that trouble for BUT it really comes off like you don\u2019t respect, or even like Hiram, when you do stuff like this to him. It would make me feel like a little kid being bossed around by a parent. Speak with him next time he has a take you disagree with and let him make his own choices even if you don\u2019t love them.", "I am not allergic to mushrooms. That being said my aversion is so strong they make me puke. Yes, YTA as are your friends.

Way to go OP.  Happy on that pedestal you put yourself on?", "YTA. What did it matter if he told the caterer that he was allergic?  This is an innocuous white lie to avoid being served what he disliked. You went out of your way to make a spectacle his preferences. He looked like a picky eater to the people at the wedding and if you would have minded your own business, he would not have had to be embarrassed and humiliated when he had to explain to the other guests why he didn\u2019t eat hardly anything. Now he will not trust you to not go behind him for other reasons.", "YTA - Why does it matter to you? You're not preparing the food, nor are you eating his food. So instead of him having something he could enjoy at a wedding with limited food options, its not like he could just run over to McDonalds and get something, he had to suffer with hunger and ridicule.", "Ex used to do with with tomatoes. He said that if he told people he was allergic, they would take him more seriously than if he just said he didn't like them.", "YTA 100%\n\nWhy would you even do that to anyone, let alone your partner?\n\nExtraordinary.", "YTA. He's a vegetarian and is aware if he doesn't request the absence of mushrooms, they will often be in his food. Also, frequently, when people have food aversions they actually have an intolerance to the food and aren't yet aware.

It cost me a few internal organs (appendix & gallbladder) when they were snuck in a dish and caused horrible inflammation.\n\nGet over yourself.

ESH, I'd say you slightly more than him.", "As a mushroom-hater myself, I get your fianc\u00e9's move. This wasn't a table-waiter situation where he could say \"hold the freaking fungus \u2014 it's disgusting and I don't know why people consider it 'food',\" so his *only* option for communicating with the kitchen was the rsvp card. \n\nA lot of people \u2014 and this is weird \u2014 just don't accept a dislike of mushrooms. They'll try to convince you to try \"the meaty portobello\" or \"the delicate morelle\" or they'll take it upon themselves to sneak them into your food in some misguided attempt to prove to you that your own tastes are just wrong. It's obnoxious, and it pushes people (like me) to lie. (Sometimes you don't want to have an argument just to get a dinner you can stand to eat.)\n\nI know about the whole kitchen protocol thing \u2014 but, again, some of us have just been pushed to the mushroom allergy lie. Personally, I stand by it as a tactic.\n\nYTA", "YTA. This kind of situation is why people tell those lies", "Hiram may have a reason for hating mushrooms. He clearly won't eat them. It may not be an anaphylactic allergy, it could be a food that he knows will make him sick.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience here - that's how I am with tomatoes. They don't make me break out in hives or cause my throat to swell, but tomatoes *will* make me strap myself to a toilet for an hour and cause me to be a walking gas canister, and I hate it. It's embarrassing and it detracts from me being able to enjoy myself. I have to tell people that it's an allergy because otherwise I get hit with \"you just don't like it\" as food with tomato is shoved in my face.\n\nThis reads to me like Hiram is that way with mushrooms. They may not make him need an EpiPen, but instead they make him sick. He doesn't want to be sick at a wedding. To avoid everything, he just says that has has a mushroom allergy. It's way easier to explain and conveys the same message - he can't eat mushrooms.\n\nFor you to go behind your back and do that was childish, petty, and lowkey power trippy, and might I add:\n\n>I felt like Hiram was lying and being disrespectful to people who have real allergies\n\n**STOP BEING A FUCKING WHITE KNIGHT**. I guarantee you anyone who goes into anaphylactic shock due to mushrooms *will not give a flying, swimming, or walking FUCK* that Hiram listed a mushroom allergy to avoid being served a food that makes him sick.

We always tell restaurants it\u2019s an intolerance, and I agree with others that using \u201callergy\u201d is going too far.  But seriously it just seems like you wanted to humiliate him.", "Honestly.... I can't sympathize with you.\n\nYeah, it's lame to lie about allergens, but you know why people do it? Because they get sick of foodservice workers ignoring or forgetting a legitimate request because it wasn't written in bold enough marker. This happens all the time to people with legitimate issues like diabetes or lactose intolerance where a simple order becomes an hours long ordeal because someone was forgetful or in some cases outright a spiteful asshole.\n\nFine, he isn't \"allergic\" to mushrooms, but he may as well be given how he basically ate nothing thanks to you. They included mushrooms because you went behind his back on the basis of \"virtues\" and didn't even have the good decency to simply say **no mushrooms.**\n\nThis wasn't even disrespectful either, this falls into the territory of \"white lies\" which every one, including yourself, tells. Hell, as you didn't tell him you did this you were genuinely acting in a deceitful fashion so frankly how are you any better. Trick question really, because a white lie can't even compare to whatever game you were playing.\n\nHere's hoping he doesn't out you for every fib or discretion on your part for the sake of *honesty\\~*\n\nYTA", "...question, exactly how does this hurt you?

No should be enough", "YTA you should not have involved yourself in this situation at all", "Wow YTA.

I don't know what it is, the smell and taste will make me gag and eyes water and I'm the least picky eater out there. If my partner went over my head and told someone to ignore my strong aversion to cilantro like I was a difficult, picky toddler who needs to taught a lesson, I'd be humiliated beyond belief.

What can you do?!", "At least 13% of people have the genetic condition that makes cilantro taste like soap, but its assumed that the percentage is likely higher as some people have simply never had cilantro", "They are not serious in terms of life or death, but they are serious in terms of I can NOT eat this food. Certain foods make me gag and I just cannot swallow, mushrooms being one. Thus I hate when people say just try it, like no I can't! \n\nWould (decent) people keep pestering someone if they said they were allergic to that food? No. But often those same people will prester someone for saying they don't like/have an aversion to the same food. Thus it's often easier to list it as an allergy.", "So they didn't have any time or care, but took the time to call someone up and let them know to ignore a specific request by one of their guests? Right.\n\nFood aversion isn't just disliking the specific food, it's much more than that. If I eat a piece of mushroom on accident, the texture will make me gag violently. I've yet to actually throw up, but I had to spit out whatever was in my mouth each time. You think I want to do that at a friend's wedding? Anywhere for that matter?\n\nYou're minimising Hiram's issue and overblowing the \"lie\"", "Yes an entire culture should change their cuisine for people who DO NOT have an allergy, they just don\u2019t like it. S/", "True. I never had it until about 6 years ago...it got popular. If there's only a tiny amount in a spicy sauce it's okay, but there's a very low threshold for me. Bleeccch.", "I don't know what they did. But I imagine it's easier to say 'the allergy list is updated to X' than plan an entire new meal option.\n\nI'm sorry but Hiram is an adult. If his food adversion is so bad for a common food item, then he should bring snacks or eat beforehand. He shouldn't expect to be catered to during a free meal.\n\nI'm only minimising his issue to be his issue only. He tried to get a catering company to totally decontaminate for him because he wasn't big enough to ring the bride and groom to discuss his adversion, or plan other food.", ">I'm sorry but Hiram is an adult. If his food adversion is so bad for a common food item, then he should bring snacks or eat beforehand. He shouldn't expect to be catered to during a free meal.\n\nSo people with allergies, vegetarians, vegans, Muslims etc. should also just eat beforehand and not bother the caterer?\n\nWe don't know what Hiram put down exactly, maybe he checked a \"non severe\" box somewhere. Maybe the best option was for OP to not go behind his back like an absolute coward and a snitch, but talk to the guy as it was happening and advise him to clarify, that contamination wasn't a risk if he felt this strongly about mushrooms.\n\nHe probably had zero faith in a conversation working. And who could blame him! His own fiance is trying to sneak mushrooms into his food, like he's a toddler that won't eat his veggies", "Hiram could have brought food or eaten beforehand if his dumb frick of a wife told him about calling the wedding party."]}
