We also have cameras focused on our entry points after a neighbour jumped our back fence and freaked me out another time.", "NTA. It's smart to go around the house and make sure all doors are locked, appliances turned off, etc., so you can fall asleep in peace and not lay there worrying about what you might have forgotten to do. One last check isn't hurting anyone. It's really none of his business whether or not you want to perform this nightly ritual. \n\nYou need to set a clear boundary here. If he can't accept that this is your home, that you set the rules here and you are in charge of your own space, there's going to be nothing but trouble ahead. This man is a guest. The fact that he wants to control and manipulate you about this common-sense routine is a serious red flag.", "It\u2019s\u2026 concerning that he takes you tending to your own personal safety as a\u2026 threat? \n\nNot digging this dude OP, gotta be honest. Reminds me a bit too much of my reckless + controlling + abusive stbx husband for my comfort. Is he generally supportive of your life choices, even when he doesn\u2019t understand/can\u2019t relate? Is it normal for him to dismiss your hard-won perspective in things he doesn\u2019t have any experience with? Does he seem to \u201cknow best\u201d about other people\u2019s choices/opinions, even when those choices/opinions have literally nothing to do with him? \n\nPS- don\u2019t stop checking your locks before bed. I have my own trauma around my stbx not closing/securing doors and won\u2019t get in to specifics bc now\u2019s not the time, but him expecting you to rely on him over your own instincts/habits is\u2026 problematic. And patronizing. And just, like, not reasonable, or smart?", "NTA but your BF IS, drop him and run", "NTA. I check even if no ones left all day. I have the memory of a gnat and I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.", "NTA\n\nHow about explaining it like this. \n\nI know you lock the door every time and part of the way you do that is that you have built up a routine and a good habit. \n\nIf i was to stop doing it every night, I would break that routine and perhaps destroy the habit. I don't do it to check on you, i do it to reinforce my own good behaviour.", "Oh he sounds swell...", "NTA, he is! A condescending one at that! I've been with my partner for 10 years and she checks the front door every night, I've never been offended by it (granted, I am also a woman). My mum makes my dad get up and double check himself, he has never been offended or mean about it either \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nHe is gaslighting you, you should reconsider if you would like to continue with this person. I would be surprised if this was the only topic he'll gaslight you about...", "NTA, your bf is being a dick.\n\nMy bf is the love of my life, since we were teenagers and everything. I see him forget to lock the door and we've had the same conversation. I told him tough shit and he accepted it cos why should it bother him. If he cares that much then he should lock the fucking door every damn time.", "NTA, hub and I both check the doors before going to bed, force of habit makes us both turn the know as we go into our room, even if we just watched the other person check it. \n\nSecurity and safety as well as peace of mind is more important than his feelings over the matter. \nI'd be kicking his sorry butt out (and then checking the doors locked) if he didn't stop with the condescending behaviour after a stern talking to.", "Absolutely normal for anyone, especially a woman living alone. If he doesn\u2019t understand that he\u2019s not worth your time, and belittling you is ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t waste anymore time on him. You have a right to do whatever you want in your home when ever you want, without judgement.  He likely has never had to experience what women experience daily with regards to their own safety and if he doesn\u2019t get that then he can leave.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re 8 months in and he\u2019s already being an ass. Lock him out!", ">tell him to step outside and check his attitude on the other side of the door.\n\nand make sure the door is locked once he's out", "If nothing else, you're also checking that nobody's tried to get in before you go to sleep. It's your house, your rules and if this guy keeps mansplaining to you, show him the door and lock it when he's on the other side of it", "I've been married for 7 years and still check the doors every night as my husband left the back door unlocked a couple of times ages ago. He doesn't get offended as he knows it's for my piece of mind.", "I'm pretty relaxed about such things but I always go around the house before I go to bed to make sure the backdoor is locked (front door locks when it closes) and the windows are all closed. Isn't this every household routine? And if it's your house, it's normal you'd do it, at least at the earlier stages. This is really weird.", "I have generalized anxiety disorder and was in a situation where someone clearly on drugs walked into my apartment in the middle of the night while my roommates were in the living room and just....sat down on my couch. \n\nNow, before I go to sleep, sometimes I get intrusive thoughts about whether the door is locked or not, and they don't stop unless I confirm with my own eyes. My husband knows this, and he's never EVER made me feel bad for taking all of 2 minutes to get up and check. \n\nyou are definitely NTA, and it shouldn't be a hit on his ego for you to check. Stay safe", "Please get that key back or change the locks immediately", "...does with how I perceive it...", "Please end it now whilst neither of you lives with the other. If you thinks it\u2019s hard now, imagine how impossible it will be if you both live together. \n\n\nIn your situation, simply go low contact and say you\u2019re too busy to have him stay over when he\u2019s next expected to stay at yours and slowly phase him out of your life. Don\u2019t give him explanations, block his number and ignore all his attempts to communicate with you. He isn\u2019t interested in saving the relationship, he just wants to maintain his control over you. If you give him another chance, he will ensure it\u2019s virtually impossible to get rid of him a second time."]}
