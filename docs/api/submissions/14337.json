Your home, your safety, your routine.

It\u2019s not about him, it\u2019s learned behavior from the situation and him turning it into something personal or offending shows a lack of empathy for your lives experience.", "NTA. Dump him.", "NTA - he's being silly. I do the same thing as you.", "NTA\nThink hard about how much time you want to spend on someone who repeatedly belittles you for prioritizing your safety.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about him, it\u2019s about a routine. You skip it when he\u2019s there, you\u2019ll skip it when he\u2019s not. That\u2019s not making sure you\u2019re safe.", "NTA\n\nHe is being very childish in acting as though a habit/routine that you have that has nothing to do with him is somehow entirely about him and whether or not you trust him.", "NTA, if he is already acting like this with passive aggressive remarks it is time to really see if this is what you want to build a relationship. I do that almost all the time even if my BF locked the door. It is just a simple security thing. What is the big deal????", "Don't be with someone who mocks your safety measures.", "NTA.

He seems extremely insecure. This is what insecure people do. They constantly scan your behavior for anything that can be interpreted as a slight or or a rejection and in doing so they make everything you do about them. \n\nAs a result, they never even acknowledge any part of your inner life that isn't about them. In this case, he has no sense of your own conscientious need for security or habits. If he's like this all the time, then to him you are a supporting player in a drama in which he is the main character. You exist only in the context of him. Eventually you find yourself in the awful situation of being in a relationship where you the person focuses on you all the time and yet you are lonely.\n\nI know I'm extrapolating a lot from a small vignette, but I've known people like this and being with them sucks.", "NTA. Have a proper conversation about how this habit is absolutely necessary for every woman that lives alone. It's nothing about your trust in him.

There is nothing wrong with checking, it give you peace of mind. When I lived alone, I would check to make sure the door is locked several times a day.

Several times over the years, I have found that I forget to lock the back door after doing something in the yard, and a couple times I forget to lock the front door after taking a package delivery that filled both my hands. That is why rituals like this are important.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to understand this is a routine you don't want to stop just because he is in the house. If you neglect it on nights he is there, it makes it more likely you would forget to do it some night when he isn't.", "NTA - Have you considered a smart lock that beeps? Maybe bf can even install it. Pretty easy.", "NTA, safety concerns are valid, also consider investing in a keypad lock that automatically locks after a few seconds of being left unlocked?", "NTA, it's a door lock, he is reading way too much into it.", "NTA. I understand as I am that way myself. Even with a security gate.", "NTA and you just reminded me to lock mine. There's nothing wrong with being secure. Especially if you've lived alone that long.

Double checking is such an entirely reasonable measure.\n\nTo me, this tells me so much about his character \u2026 what an incredibly mediocre human. You can do better OP\u2026", "That\u2019s some kind of nerve. He knows you do it even if nobody but you is in the house, but he sees it as a trust issue. In other words, he\u2019s expecting you to trust him more than you trust yourself. If he wants that kind of trust, he should go start a cult, not build a romantic partnership. NTA.", "NTA.  As women, unfortunately we have to live with constant anxiety over our safety.  He has the privilege of not feeling like he could be attacked at any given moment, and I can't imagine how nice it must be to feel that free.  This is about him literally not having any idea that half the population just lives with a basic level of general fear.  Maybe try sitting him down and having an honest conversation with him about what it's like to live alone as a woman, walk to your car late at night, walk down the street alone, etc.  My dad is almost 70, has 3 daughters, and my mom and I just had this conversation with him a couple days ago.  He truly had no idea, and I think your BF is just operating from a special place of blissful ignorance.\n\nObviously don't change a thing.

I check locks as part of routine and comfort even if I just came through the door an hour ago and I'm certain I locked it. It becomes a comfort ritual/routine to prep for sleep and who's to say if you didn't do it some nights when he's there you might forget another time when he's not.

Does he always make everything about him?", "NTA - Routines are ingrained. I check locks every night, have since I was a kid after nightmares about doors being unlocked and a large black wolf coming into my childhood house. Now it's just a routine that I've done a million times. Sometimes I get out of bed because I can't remember if I did or not. It makes me feel safe to know that it's locked before I settle in for the night. My hubs found it funny at first but once he knew it was just habit and a harmless one, he was good with it.\n\nI'm at a point now where I'm good just asking if he locked it and letting it go. It was not easy to get there. It was never about him and he knew that.", "NTA\n\n\"It's part of my nightly routine, I don't comment on yours, I'd appreciate you not comment on mine\"", "NTA. He shouldn't be questioning thus at all. \n\nI'm married,  live with my husband,  two big kids (taller than me), and a good sized dog and I still check the house every night. And I teach my kids to do the same. It's just basic security.  Anyone who had an issue with that is not someone I care to have around.", "NTA\n\nI always check that my doors are locked before bed and I live alone.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous to say I don\u2019t trust myself; it\u2019s basic security.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t he trust you when you say it\u2019s not about him?", "Thanks I thought the same", "Hah!", "Exactly! Not sure why this has even become a big enough thing for me to actually get others opinions on it. I thought I was losing it for a second!", "Yes, it\u2019s all this 100%. I have been aware of it for some time and have been trying to mitigate it. \nHe does not have his own life outside of our relationship, he relies on me completely for his social life. I have a very active social life with friends/coworkers etc. He doesn\u2019t like it. I am constantly begging him not to be upset that I want time alone or time with friends. He interprets that need as me consciously and actively not wanting to spend time with him. It\u2019s exhausting! \nI had the big conversation with him today about all of it and he told me I have misinterpreted every single thing. So apparently I\u2019m in the wrong.", "Lmao! I watch a lot of true crime too, so that totally makes sense, but he has a key to my house, so that theory is out the window.
