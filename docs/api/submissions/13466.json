Sounds like you two had a special bond and she wanted you to have it. You aren\u2019t disrespectful of her memory but keeping her memory alive.

This woman had previously given my daughter various items that she no longer wanted. For the cremation, my daughter gave back the clothes and hats that she knew the old lady most liked regardless as to their real value knowing that they would be \u201clost\u201d. \n\nThis little old lady had been a seamstress for Dior, then a window-dresser for a high-end clothing store and finally had run a second hand dress agency in a well-to-do area so a lot of her stuff was vintage, high-end designer. She also had a lot of clothes that she had made herself that were of no value. That was irrelevant when my daughter was selecting her \u201cgoing away\u201d clothes. She instead made sure that she wore only her very best.\n\nAs an example - a basic Dior bucket hat from the 70\u2019s she sold for \u00a3150 on EBay. The hat that \u201cgot burnt\u201d was the one the lady had bought for the Queens Diamond Jubilee.

Tell them that every time you wear the scarf you think of Anne, and also of that beautiful story of her meeting her husband. And as Anne wanted you to have the scarf, she would most likely appreciate that it brings fond memories rather than rot in her grave.", "NTA - Unless they were there when she gave it to you, they have no way to determine if \"she was in her right mind\" or not. I say this as someone who had a grandparent pass away last August from advanced Alzheimer's and Dementia, and was the only family member who spent any time with him.\n\nIt is very easy to tell when they are and are not aware of their surroundings. I don't know if this was the case with your neighbor, but either way, I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to you because you clearly spent a lot of time with her and bonded so you would know if something was off. Them taking away the scarf from you and burying it in the ground does nothing except take away your token of her memory and leaves the scarf where no one can use it, appreciate it or enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nI would personally have given it back.\n\nBut i don't think you're evil for keeping it", "NTA.\n\nI understand it holds sentimental value to the family but they plan to bury that sentiment into dirt.\n\nYou also have sentimental value to the scarf, this person seems like quite a big part of your childhood and a memory of them to keep is absolutely amazing and quite frankly the family should be happy to see that Anne gifted it to somebody she cared about.\n\nI'd say maintaining a sentimental item trumps burying it in the ground to rot. We waste way too much on the dead as it is.", "I would've gave the scarf back to them. But NTA, it's a gift, they should respect that. I can understand they are sad about not having the scarf back, but they are wrong to treat you like that. (Sorry for the bad english)", "NTA, I understand the sentimental value for both you and her family, but they shouldn't yell about it or be rude about you wanting to keep it. However it seems like they want the scarf for a good reason (since they want to put it in her grave). If they come back, apologize and ask politely, maybe consider giving it to them so she can be buried with it.", "NTA BUT I would advise to let them have this. Look, she did give it to you, she would have known what it meant, she didn't care. That's fine. But her family care and I think it'd be sweet to let them have it just for their peace of mind.", "YTA\u2026give the scarf back to the family. You\u2019re allowed to just let people who are mourning the loss of their matriarch have things that remind them of her.", "technically NTA as she did give it to you, and the family approached you way too aggresively, but cmon, they told you their plan is to put it in the grave where she will lie next to her husband... give them the scarf.", "NAH You're not TA for wanting to keep it as a sentiment from someone you liked and who gave it to you. But I think, for respectful reasons. You should have given it back. They weren't the AH for wanting to do something they thought she would've like them to do.\n\nEdit : I also think they could have dropped the subject bwfor eit got heated.", "NAH, but I do like the idea of putting the scarf in her grave to be honest. Seems symbolic and in a way romantic too. I'm not sure why you would be against it.\n\nAlso do you want to keep the scarf because it's pretty or because it reminds you of her?", "YTA going against the grain here - elderly folks often experience extreme changes in their ways of thinking toward the ends of their lives. It\u2019s possible that she forgot what the scarf meant to her and her family. Sometimes when folks are nearing their ends of lives they stop valuing possessions altogether. This is how many will wars start. And this is how caretakers and often influence their charges to change their wills to leave everything to them, instead of to offspring as originally intended. You should return the scarf\u2026", "NTA - the family is disrespecting her by not respecting her choices when she was alive.  Sounds like she also loved you and she wanted you to have the scarf.  Enjoy with good memories of her.", "NTA. That's yours, it was a gift. There is absolutely no reason to take it from you", "Info: was Anne senile when she gave you the scarf? If they have money, the determination and a medical report saying Anne was senile; they may try the legal route to get it back. \n\nDoesn't seem valuable but if it's important to them and they have the money, you may want to be sure whether Anne was senile or not.", "NAH. I believe both parties have their own fair arguments. But personally, I would hand over the scarf as for me it's not worth fighting over and hurting or getting hurt emotionally. But it is your final judgment that matters as the scarf ultimately belongs to you.

I thought i read it wrong and it was gifted feb 2022, not that it changes anything.\n\nWhat would have been appropriate was if they had come by your house asking politely for the scarf.

First of all, even if this scarf has the significance they say it has (which I'm not sure I believe), it has absolutely zero bearing in this story. It was THEIR idea to bury it with her. Not HER idea. Not to mention it's a bit of a weird idea, why the scarf? Why something she was wearing when she MET her husband? Why not her wedding ring, something she wore on her wedding day, or any other memento from any other important day? Also, it's not like this was her favourite thing that she always wore or something, it's a thing THEY chose, out of all her belongings - perhaps because it doesn't belong to them, so it comes at a free cost to them. Or maybe they are not ahs in general, they are just grieving and an idea stuck in their heads, and they wanted to do that to feel better; but they are behaving like ahs in this instance, coming in this manner to attack you, not thinking at all about how you would be feeling. You don't treat your dead's loved ones like this. THIS is disrespect. Even if she was completely senile and gave away something valuable, the least they could do would be to treat you with kindness, and bring you some other memento to cherish Ann by. Not come at your home and treat you like this.\n\nSecond, since this is not one of her favourite things, this is not even honouring her, this is tying her to her husband at death; given she got married to the man in the 50s or so, was her marriage even her choice? Because what comes to mind is how much I saw my own grandma come to life after my grandfather died. And she had actually CHOSEN to marry him. She was simply an active person that suddenly became free, and she lived quite a few years after him, travelled and did things; things she couldn't do before, when she was taking care of him. And make no mistake, I was closer to my grandpa than my grandmother when he was alive, I was even named after him. I just have eyes and can see what's going on.\n\nLastly, they are also disrespecting her by disrespecting the relationship the two of you had. Or perhaps they are jealous of it. You being her bonus granddaughter, and being her neighbour, means you were closer to her than they were in certain aspects. I mean ffs, you were helping her clean when she gave you the scarf. \n\nShe loved you kid, she was a grandma to you, and you were a grand-daughter to her. Don't let those people take this relationship away from you, both of you. You absolutely did NOT disrespect Ann. NTA.", "Nta.

But her family certainly isn\u2019t either.\n\nBeing an unofficial grandma (I have several unofficial relatives so I get it), you too are probably grieving. Do you have anything else to remember her by?\n\nI think this is one of those cases where maybe you should give it back, but I also won\u2019t judge you for not doing so.", "Ehhh if she wasn\u2019t at full mental capacity it\u2019s very possible the family has a point. Not everyone irl is always scamming.\n\nI\u2019ll give you that it\u2019s probably 75% chance they\u2019re scamming though and she did give her the scarf in full cognizance of what she was doing, just raising the possibility.", "I still wonder if there is more to it. Is it possible those pearls are something special, like real deep sea pearls and thus quite expensive or something?", "I'm sure that the family will be getting rid of tons of stuff, and if it was a matter of OP having something to remember Anne by, it'd be pretty easy to find her something nice.  As it is, OP is really hurting this family, all for the sake of an heirloom that she didn't even know the importance of.", "THIS!!", "The pearls seem to be an immitation. At first I assumed their were plastic, but now I'm not sure. I've read on the Internet that fake pearls are often made with ceramic or even shells.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have Dementia, at least judging from what I was able to observe. She sometimes forgot things like the location of some belongings or the exact day of the week and she sometimes called my by my mom's name, but she usually remembered most things quite well for a 91 year old. She was aware of who I was.", "Yup, older memories are the LAST to go, not the first.", "The family is claiming that. However, OP went to visit nearly every day. I would think if she had been not in her right mind, OP would have noticed. In addition, OP states that this scarf was found in a wardrobe. It was out of sight out of mind until then.", "Exactly.  I am astounded at all of the N T A here, when it's pretty clearly YTA.  (Although OP is young, I'd kinda hope that her parents would've helped her understand this, but it sounds like they reinforced her entitlement.  I guess sometimes AHs raise AHs.)", "I agree with both of you and just want to add the story seems a bit off\u2026 You were in her wardrobe, but why? You were there to chat and maybe help her clean a bit. You took it upon yourself to take it out of her wardrobe to show it to her which is a bit sketchy to me. There are tons of stories of actual caregivers convincing elderly people to give them things. Not saying that\u2019s the case.", "And you can see that this disbelief is part of the reasoning behind the ah verdict. Some people think that you are just a teen and only want the scarf because it's something shiny - and if that IS indeed the case, then I would think you are the ah. However I don't think this is the case, and the scarf is a gift from your bonus-grandma that you loved, and it connects you to her. Hence I have voted that you are not the ah.\n\nYou know what your motivation is though, so it's up to you to decide.", "It could be, but if you loved her..imagine how much they must have loved her, even more. Obviously it's not about money for the family, it's a scarf, but maybe a way of remembering both grandparents, and honouring them. Idk, maybe not the AH, but inconsiderate.", "I think it\u2019s an entirely reasonable assumption to make given that the family told OP that her friend had been declining mentally. Loss of judgement, such as being overly generous with money or gifts, is a common early sign of dementia, one that frequently precedes memory loss. It\u2019s one reason why elderly individuals are much more susceptible to scams and financial abuse, though I\u2019m not accusing OP of that. The deceased\u2019s children are way more likely to have known that this was a pattern or diagnosis than her teenage neighbor, even if they were close.", "This seems pretty unlikely.  How did all your neighbors know this scarf - that had been in the back of Anne's wardrobe for who knows how long - was hers? And know it well enough to be sure the one you were wearing was the same one? And happen to be outside every single day when you left your house to go to school? And be observant enough to notice and remember your scarf? And be physically close enough to identify it?

Also just because Anne was living alone doesn't mean her mental health was great, my great grandma lived alone until she died at 94, she was hardly fully lucid but that didnt mean my family was neglecting her, people visited every day.\n\nAt this point it's too late to bury Anne with it just because OP decided to be selfish which is the saddest part imo.", "It's just a scarf, a material object for you,  but sentimental for them. You can buy another scarf,  they cannot redo this moment.  \n\nYTA big time", "Nta Anne choice was to give it to you therefore it is your respect her memory by keeping her present", "NTA, and sorry for your loss. Anne clearly cared about you and wanted you to have the scarf. Hopefully when her family calms down and sees beyond their grief, they will realize that. Either way, wear the scarf with pride and remember the love Anne had for you when she chose to give it to you.", "NTA. It's  their sentimental connection. But really. A scarf in a coffin. I don't get this stuff. I don't get being buried with things unless it's in the will. It will serve zero sentimental value 6 feet in the ground. \n\nYou wearing that scarf keeps the memory alive...if that's what the issue is. \n\nRegardless. She gave it to you. It's yours.", "You\u2019re NTA, but I would just give the scarf to the family. It means a lot to them. I\u2019m confused on how the family knew OP even had the scarf.", "OMG no, honey. you are soooooo NTA!  I am 60 and lost my mom (93) four months ago.   You provided what so many seniors don't have....someone who cares for and loves them and enjoys spending time with them.  Anne wanted YOU to have the scarf, and if she was anything like MY mom, she would have thought that burying the scarf to rot away underground was a total waste.  Anne wanted it to go to someone who would appreciate it, and that was you.  If there is an afterlife, I am sure she and her beloved husband are reunited and their legacy will live on every time you look at the scarf.  Her family can go pound sand.", "At 91 they\u2019re probably right. She wasn\u2019t all there. YTA", "Her body won't be \"warmed\" by the scarf; dead bodies don't feel anything. The scarf will not be a \"constant memory\" of her husband; dead bodies cannot remember anything. If there is an afterlife, her soul won't need any material reminder of their love, because she will be reunited with her husband in Heaven. It is just a ritual meant to comfort the family and I find it weird that the family are getting so hung up on a piece of clothing. I think their grief might be clouding a bit their judgement, which is understandable.\n\nBut I am amazed that they are so hell-bent on burying her with a scarf that she did not want to be buried with. The old lady gave the scarf away, so she wanted her beloved scarf to be enjoyed by someone else.\n\nAnd, frankly, I wouldn't have the gall to go to one of my grandma's friends and ask her to give back to me a gift my grandma made to her. She might not be family, but she still cared about the old lady, so she might also be grieving for her, even if not at the same degree as them. I would feel it to be cruel to ask back for the last gift my grandma gave to one of her friends.", "This is a good point. In some cultures when someone compliments something it is customary to take it off and offer it to them. It\u2019s a generosity thing but also like a \u201cif someone is coveting this it is bad luck to keep it\u201d.", "Yeah, I'm pretty sure my mum gave some rando her engagement ring, I'm pretty pissed at whoever accepted it.", "I have a relative who theoretically has full mental capacity, but has, in senior moments attempted to gift me items that are intended for other people because they momentarily forgot.  \nIt would be very hurtful to the intended recipient if I took those things for myself. \n\nI can\u2019t comment on this scenario because we don\u2019t know enough information", "*Is it possible those pearls are something special*\n\nCame here to say this.  \n\nGet the pearls appraised, OP.  \n\nMy wicked idea:  If the pearls are valuable, replace them on the scarf with look a likes and then give them the scarf.  Let us know how long after the funeral they come to complain about your duplicity.  Know nothing.", "I don\u2019t consider it an heirloom.  It was a person\u2019s scarf being buried with the same person.  An heirloom is passed through generations.", "Even if their story was completely true, how does burying it honor her? Is she an Egyptian who's going to use it in the afterlife? It would mean more to Anne to have someone love it and use it rather than let it rot in the ground.", "It\u2019s a final act of love for their parents. Also, funeral rituals are common in cultures around the world. You don\u2019t have to understand it because it isn\u2019t your mother.", "Do you check your grandmother's possessions to make sure they are accounted for every time you visit? She probably passed away and the family was probably trying to put together her outfit she would be buried in and when they went to get the scarf it was gone. They said they wanted it buried next to the husband. So grandma is probably newly deceased.", "Where are you getting that no one checked on her for more than a month from?", "As someone who has recently been helping an octogenarian on several cleaning afternoons: decluttering, organizing, and wardrobe, closet and cupboard opening were very much an organic part of the process.", "Same.  My grandma passed in 1990. I was up my grandads ass at least once a day as a 21 year old.   I adored that man and was worried about him.   He was more a father to me than his son.\n\nOp,  your neighbor knew what she was doing.  Keep that scarf in good conscience.\n\nEDIT:  NTA", "It's pretty clear that saying \"This February\" when it was a month ago means February of this year. She talked to her about the scarf a month ago. The person you're responding to was disputing your definition of \"regular\" as once a year when she lives right next door and visited in February of all months. February does not have a holiday where one would visit family / elders specifically.", "I concur. \"Last February\" would be 22. I'd say \"this past February\" for last month and til the end of the year and \"in February\" would also describe anything taking place that month.", "Lol happy to get to highlight how you cinched that SO from date 1. Stay awesome palindromer!", "Good job pretending ohmarlasinger isn't your SO. :)", "Point me in the right direction, I gotchu Lauxy", "Yeah, there was a long string of comments about OP's phrasing, and eventually she edited it.", "Yta...", "NTA. grief is really hard on everyone. but if she was mentally cognizant enough for them to be comfortable with her living alone, she probably had full mental capacity to give you that scarf. \n\nyou were there for her, spent quality time together, you did household tasks with her. there are so many other reasons she could have had to give you that scarf. she chose you", "Nah this fair go. If my grandmother or mother had given something special away during her final days, then that person must've meant something to her.\n\nThe alternative is you offer to be there and bury the scarf with woman. If they don't go for it something is fishy.", "NTA", "Did she have dementia?", "There are a lot of comments about the family grieving. I don't see anyone acknowledging that OP is also grieving for the surrogate grandma that she grew up with. I'm going to abstain from voting because this is far too nuanced an issue for anyone who is not directly involved to comment on.\n\nAh, who the hell am I trying to fool? This is Reddit! NAH due to grief all around.", "NTA she chose to give the scarf to u someone she had a special bond with out of love. If she wanted to be buried with it she would have said so. Ur not disrespecting her for keeping it but u would be if u went against her wish and gave in to her family\u2019s wish. If she wasn\u2019t at her full mental capacity why were the not there helping y\u2019all clean does she live alone", "Maybe they think the pearls are real,lol", "Used pearls are never expensive.", "That's only what the family was claiming... if it is valuable, or someone else just wants it, they could be making up a sentimental reason to get it back... NTA", "It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re making it up. It was their mother\u2019s, she died and they want it back. If some strange kid wandered off with the necklace my dad gave my mother when they were dating, I\u2019d want it back. It\u2019s significant to me and my brother, not them.", "she was 91 I don't understand why everyones taking the word of a 17 year old being senile or not. I think showing the scarf and saying how pretty it was, was a way of at least hinting she wanted it", "She didn't wander off with the scarf... their mom gave it to her", "Was organising or decluttering mentioned?", "You too, friend!! Hope you have an awesome rest of your week. :)", "Ahhh", "NTA, she gave it to you.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole and you were gifted the item, you can do as you please but I don\u2019t think it would be a hill I would die on lol I personally would give it back to her family and let them do as they wish if it means that much to them", "NTA. It was a gift. Visit her grave and bring bright flowers. She loved you obviously. F them.", "If she was suffering from dementia then she should not have been alone. If she gave away an heirloom in confusion, that is on them. NTA.", "NTA. I am so sorry for the loss of your adopted grandma. I had a Tina next door growing up and she was all I knew of a grandma type. Keep that scarf in a safe place and cherish the memories.", "NTA the other family kinda seems like the AH here coming over and just screaming at a teenager and demanding the scarf instead of politely explaining the situation and asking if they can have it back. Feels kinda sussy", "YTA. All the people saying \u201cshe gave it to you\u201d have clearly never had a relative w/ dementia (like my grandma), Parkinson\u2019s (like my papa), or similar health issues. Her family knew her before her health was in decline, so they are much better equipped to gauge her wishes than you are. You were well within your right to let them know she had given it to you, but when they responded that her actions towards the end were not consistent w/ her wishes when in better health, you should have dropped it and given it back.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of \u201cfunerals are for the living\u201d is relevant here. This is a grieving family, and from their perspective, they\u2019re perceiving this as someone stealing from their dead relative. There is no piece of clothing nice enough to be worth hurting people like that, whether you know them or not. It\u2019s not too late to fix this: apologize and return the scarf.", "Yeah, it's a cardinal rule when working with the elderly that you don't accept gifts. If they were very close as friends, it is a different scenario of course. Just agreeing that this is a known thing and that more info (like the family's perspective) would be useful.", "Most people would consider yearly not regularly", "Arguing with a young woman over a gift that was given in good faith is not a final act of love. Is the father dressed up in the attire he wore on his first date and this whole idea was planned from the jump what they are going to wear to the grave? Doesn\u2019t seem like it from the OP\u2019s description of how she found it. It seems like they saw it on her decided they wanted it back for themselves, whether to bury it for sentiment or to keep it, doesn\u2019t matter. It was an act for themselves not for the deceased. But that\u2019s my opinion. My body is being donated to science so admittedly the idea of this argument is truly wild to me.", "It said this February it\u2019s march now so that means the scarf was given to her last month. Plus not many people will ask or automatically assume that there\u2019s a story behind every piece of clothing it not like it was a wedding dress and she might not have known if the pearls were real or not. Btw she not a grown up yet she only 17 in case the when I was growing up threw u off", "\u201cHelping her clean up the house\u201d ??", "She chose to give it to you. that was her legacy. How did they even find out she gave it to you?\n\nKeep the scarf. Let it remind you of her kindness.\n\nNTA", "Maybe im looking at this differently, but soft YTA \n\nMy great grandma always had jewelry missing when I went to visit her because people would come by and tell her how much they liked her things while going through them. \n\nShe had a lot of heirloom jewelry that assumed known to be intended for others that went missing.  She lived on her own for a little while before she started to mentally deteriorate. She wasn't completely incapable, but she would often times have little\nLapses in judgement and memory. \n\nIt honestly happened fast and it took a long time to get her into a facility because of the resources available, but under a year.  We tried to have family and friends with her and it was unfortunately some of the \"friends\" who took advantage of my great grandma in that state.  \n\n\nI know my grandma had asked for the items back and the people who tricked my great grandma refused.  \n\n\nI think that it should be pointed out that things like this happen to elderly people a lot. They become easy to manipulate and it's often people you think would never do those things that do do it.", "I would argue that it would take a cold soul to demand back a final memento of a beloved friend.", "My dad (86) has been on a kick of trying to sell everything in the house to anyone who visits, including items with more sentimental than monetary value (like my grandfather's mineral collection, or the air-rifle I learned to shoot when I was eight) It's frustrating and sad because while it's his stuff to sell, he's pushing it for dirt cheap  to strangers who are just humoring him. He doesn't have dementia but he's bored and I think he likes the challenge. It was really upsetting to go to a local restaurant and see family heirlooms on their wall as decoration. Simple objects can have a lot of emotional impact.", "because it may be the only thing she has to remember her by.", "OP said the neighbor was basically a surrogate grandma, they had known her all their life. How is that \u201cpretty much a stranger\u201d?", "If it helps, OP answers this here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125ibqo/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hand_over_a_dead_womans/je4cwus](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125ibqo/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hand_over_a_dead_womans/je4cwus)", "I'm sitting here trying to think how people could be financially disadvantaged by delaying. Was it like a trust situation where all grandkids over a certain age got a set percentage, and by delaying it, someone had a birthday and the numbers changed? You've genuinely got me puzzled as most assets would be stable or increase in value over time, so the only variable I can think of are the people themselves."]}
