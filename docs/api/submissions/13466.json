Sounds like you two had a special bond and she wanted you to have it. You aren\u2019t disrespectful of her memory but keeping her memory alive.

This woman had previously given my daughter various items that she no longer wanted. For the cremation, my daughter gave back the clothes and hats that she knew the old lady most liked regardless as to their real value knowing that they would be \u201clost\u201d. \n\nThis little old lady had been a seamstress for Dior, then a window-dresser for a high-end clothing store and finally had run a second hand dress agency in a well-to-do area so a lot of her stuff was vintage, high-end designer. She also had a lot of clothes that she had made herself that were of no value. That was irrelevant when my daughter was selecting her \u201cgoing away\u201d clothes. She instead made sure that she wore only her very best.\n\nAs an example - a basic Dior bucket hat from the 70\u2019s she sold for \u00a3150 on EBay. The hat that \u201cgot burnt\u201d was the one the lady had bought for the Queens Diamond Jubilee.

Tell them that every time you wear the scarf you think of Anne, and also of that beautiful story of her meeting her husband. And as Anne wanted you to have the scarf, she would most likely appreciate that it brings fond memories rather than rot in her grave.", "NTA - Unless they were there when she gave it to you, they have no way to determine if \"she was in her right mind\" or not. I say this as someone who had a grandparent pass away last August from advanced Alzheimer's and Dementia, and was the only family member who spent any time with him.\n\nIt is very easy to tell when they are and are not aware of their surroundings. I don't know if this was the case with your neighbor, but either way, I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to you because you clearly spent a lot of time with her and bonded so you would know if something was off. Them taking away the scarf from you and burying it in the ground does nothing except take away your token of her memory and leaves the scarf where no one can use it, appreciate it or enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nI would personally have given it back.\n\nBut i don't think you're evil for keeping it", "NTA.\n\nI understand it holds sentimental value to the family but they plan to bury that sentiment into dirt.\n\nYou also have sentimental value to the scarf, this person seems like quite a big part of your childhood and a memory of them to keep is absolutely amazing and quite frankly the family should be happy to see that Anne gifted it to somebody she cared about.\n\nI'd say maintaining a sentimental item trumps burying it in the ground to rot. We waste way too much on the dead as it is.", "I would've gave the scarf back to them. But NTA, it's a gift, they should respect that. I can understand they are sad about not having the scarf back, but they are wrong to treat you like that. (Sorry for the bad english)", "NTA, I understand the sentimental value for both you and her family, but they shouldn't yell about it or be rude about you wanting to keep it. However it seems like they want the scarf for a good reason (since they want to put it in her grave). If they come back, apologize and ask politely, maybe consider giving it to them so she can be buried with it.", "NTA BUT I would advise to let them have this. Look, she did give it to you, she would have known what it meant, she didn't care. That's fine. But her family care and I think it'd be sweet to let them have it just for their peace of mind.", "YTA\u2026give the scarf back to the family. You\u2019re allowed to just let people who are mourning the loss of their matriarch have things that remind them of her.", "technically NTA as she did give it to you, and the family approached you way too aggresively, but cmon, they told you their plan is to put it in the grave where she will lie next to her husband... give them the scarf.", "NAH You're not TA for wanting to keep it as a sentiment from someone you liked and who gave it to you. But I think, for respectful reasons. You should have given it back. They weren't the AH for wanting to do something they thought she would've like them to do.\n\nEdit : I also think they could have dropped the subject bwfor eit got heated.", "NAH, but I do like the idea of putting the scarf in her grave to be honest. Seems symbolic and in a way romantic too. I'm not sure why you would be against it.\n\nAlso do you want to keep the scarf because it's pretty or because it reminds you of her?", "YTA going against the grain here - elderly folks often experience extreme changes in their ways of thinking toward the ends of their lives. It\u2019s possible that she forgot what the scarf meant to her and her family. Sometimes when folks are nearing their ends of lives they stop valuing possessions altogether. This is how many will wars start. And this is how caretakers and often influence their charges to change their wills to leave everything to them, instead of to offspring as originally intended. You should return the scarf\u2026", "NTA - the family is disrespecting her by not respecting her choices when she was alive.  Sounds like she also loved you and she wanted you to have the scarf.  Enjoy with good memories of her.", "NTA. That's yours, it was a gift. There is absolutely no reason to take it from you", "Info: was Anne senile when she gave you the scarf? If they have money, the determination and a medical report saying Anne was senile; they may try the legal route to get it back. \n\nDoesn't seem valuable but if it's important to them and they have the money, you may want to be sure whether Anne was senile or not.", "NAH. I believe both parties have their own fair arguments. But personally, I would hand over the scarf as for me it's not worth fighting over and hurting or getting hurt emotionally. But it is your final judgment that matters as the scarf ultimately belongs to you.

I thought i read it wrong and it was gifted feb 2022, not that it changes anything.\n\nWhat would have been appropriate was if they had come by your house asking politely for the scarf.
