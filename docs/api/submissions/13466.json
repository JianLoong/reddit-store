Sounds like you two had a special bond and she wanted you to have it. You aren\u2019t disrespectful of her memory but keeping her memory alive.

This woman had previously given my daughter various items that she no longer wanted. For the cremation, my daughter gave back the clothes and hats that she knew the old lady most liked regardless as to their real value knowing that they would be \u201clost\u201d. \n\nThis little old lady had been a seamstress for Dior, then a window-dresser for a high-end clothing store and finally had run a second hand dress agency in a well-to-do area so a lot of her stuff was vintage, high-end designer. She also had a lot of clothes that she had made herself that were of no value. That was irrelevant when my daughter was selecting her \u201cgoing away\u201d clothes. She instead made sure that she wore only her very best.\n\nAs an example - a basic Dior bucket hat from the 70\u2019s she sold for \u00a3150 on EBay. The hat that \u201cgot burnt\u201d was the one the lady had bought for the Queens Diamond Jubilee.

Tell them that every time you wear the scarf you think of Anne, and also of that beautiful story of her meeting her husband. And as Anne wanted you to have the scarf, she would most likely appreciate that it brings fond memories rather than rot in her grave.", "NTA - Unless they were there when she gave it to you, they have no way to determine if \"she was in her right mind\" or not. I say this as someone who had a grandparent pass away last August from advanced Alzheimer's and Dementia, and was the only family member who spent any time with him.\n\nIt is very easy to tell when they are and are not aware of their surroundings. I don't know if this was the case with your neighbor, but either way, I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to you because you clearly spent a lot of time with her and bonded so you would know if something was off. Them taking away the scarf from you and burying it in the ground does nothing except take away your token of her memory and leaves the scarf where no one can use it, appreciate it or enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nI would personally have given it back.\n\nBut i don't think you're evil for keeping it", "NTA.\n\nI understand it holds sentimental value to the family but they plan to bury that sentiment into dirt.\n\nYou also have sentimental value to the scarf, this person seems like quite a big part of your childhood and a memory of them to keep is absolutely amazing and quite frankly the family should be happy to see that Anne gifted it to somebody she cared about.\n\nI'd say maintaining a sentimental item trumps burying it in the ground to rot. We waste way too much on the dead as it is.", "I would've gave the scarf back to them. But NTA, it's a gift, they should respect that. I can understand they are sad about not having the scarf back, but they are wrong to treat you like that. (Sorry for the bad english)", "NTA, I understand the sentimental value for both you and her family, but they shouldn't yell about it or be rude about you wanting to keep it. However it seems like they want the scarf for a good reason (since they want to put it in her grave). If they come back, apologize and ask politely, maybe consider giving it to them so she can be buried with it.", "NTA BUT I would advise to let them have this. Look, she did give it to you, she would have known what it meant, she didn't care. That's fine. But her family care and I think it'd be sweet to let them have it just for their peace of mind.", "YTA\u2026give the scarf back to the family. You\u2019re allowed to just let people who are mourning the loss of their matriarch have things that remind them of her.", "technically NTA as she did give it to you, and the family approached you way too aggresively, but cmon, they told you their plan is to put it in the grave where she will lie next to her husband... give them the scarf.", "NAH You're not TA for wanting to keep it as a sentiment from someone you liked and who gave it to you. But I think, for respectful reasons. You should have given it back. They weren't the AH for wanting to do something they thought she would've like them to do.\n\nEdit : I also think they could have dropped the subject bwfor eit got heated.", "NAH, but I do like the idea of putting the scarf in her grave to be honest. Seems symbolic and in a way romantic too. I'm not sure why you would be against it.\n\nAlso do you want to keep the scarf because it's pretty or because it reminds you of her?", "YTA going against the grain here - elderly folks often experience extreme changes in their ways of thinking toward the ends of their lives. It\u2019s possible that she forgot what the scarf meant to her and her family. Sometimes when folks are nearing their ends of lives they stop valuing possessions altogether. This is how many will wars start. And this is how caretakers and often influence their charges to change their wills to leave everything to them, instead of to offspring as originally intended. You should return the scarf\u2026", "NTA - the family is disrespecting her by not respecting her choices when she was alive.  Sounds like she also loved you and she wanted you to have the scarf.  Enjoy with good memories of her.", "NTA. That's yours, it was a gift. There is absolutely no reason to take it from you", "Info: was Anne senile when she gave you the scarf? If they have money, the determination and a medical report saying Anne was senile; they may try the legal route to get it back. \n\nDoesn't seem valuable but if it's important to them and they have the money, you may want to be sure whether Anne was senile or not.", "NAH. I believe both parties have their own fair arguments. But personally, I would hand over the scarf as for me it's not worth fighting over and hurting or getting hurt emotionally. But it is your final judgment that matters as the scarf ultimately belongs to you.

I thought i read it wrong and it was gifted feb 2022, not that it changes anything.\n\nWhat would have been appropriate was if they had come by your house asking politely for the scarf.

Not come at your home and treat you like this.\n\nSecond, since this is not one of her favourite things, this is not even honouring her, this is tying her to her husband at death; given she got married to the man in the 50s or so, was her marriage even her choice? Because what comes to mind is how much I saw my own grandma come to life after my grandfather died. And she had actually CHOSEN to marry him. She was simply an active person that suddenly became free, and she lived quite a few years after him, travelled and did things; things she couldn't do before, when she was taking care of him. And make no mistake, I was closer to my grandpa than my grandmother when he was alive, I was even named after him. I just have eyes and can see what's going on.\n\nLastly, they are also disrespecting her by disrespecting the relationship the two of you had. Or perhaps they are jealous of it. You being her bonus granddaughter, and being her neighbour, means you were closer to her than they were in certain aspects. I mean ffs, you were helping her clean when she gave you the scarf. \n\nShe loved you kid, she was a grandma to you, and you were a grand-daughter to her. Don't let those people take this relationship away from you, both of you. You absolutely did NOT disrespect Ann. NTA.", "Nta. They are awful for making you feel like an AH for not wanting to give A GIFT back. And for wanting it back!", "I bet that you probably helped Anne more than her own family and she wanted to give you something nice to remember her by.  NTA", "I\u2019m going rogue and saying NAH because while I understand/agree with (most) everyone else, I don\u2019t think any of the makes you an asshole. But her family certainly isn\u2019t either.\n\nBeing an unofficial grandma (I have several unofficial relatives so I get it), you too are probably grieving. Do you have anything else to remember her by?\n\nI think this is one of those cases where maybe you should give it back, but I also won\u2019t judge you for not doing so.", "Ehhh if she wasn\u2019t at full mental capacity it\u2019s very possible the family has a point. Not everyone irl is always scamming.\n\nI\u2019ll give you that it\u2019s probably 75% chance they\u2019re scamming though and she did give her the scarf in full cognizance of what she was doing, just raising the possibility.", "I still wonder if there is more to it. Is it possible those pearls are something special, like real deep sea pearls and thus quite expensive or something?", "I'm sure that the family will be getting rid of tons of stuff, and if it was a matter of OP having something to remember Anne by, it'd be pretty easy to find her something nice.  As it is, OP is really hurting this family, all for the sake of an heirloom that she didn't even know the importance of.", "THIS!!", "The pearls seem to be an immitation. At first I assumed their were plastic, but now I'm not sure. I've read on the Internet that fake pearls are often made with ceramic or even shells.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have Dementia, at least judging from what I was able to observe. She sometimes forgot things like the location of some belongings or the exact day of the week and she sometimes called my by my mom's name, but she usually remembered most things quite well for a 91 year old. She was aware of who I was.", "Yup, older memories are the LAST to go, not the first.", "The family is claiming that. However, OP went to visit nearly every day. I would think if she had been not in her right mind, OP would have noticed. In addition, OP states that this scarf was found in a wardrobe. It was out of sight out of mind until then.", "Exactly.  I am astounded at all of the N T A here, when it's pretty clearly YTA.  (Although OP is young, I'd kinda hope that her parents would've helped her understand this, but it sounds like they reinforced her entitlement.  I guess sometimes AHs raise AHs.)", "I agree with both of you and just want to add the story seems a bit off\u2026 You were in her wardrobe, but why? You were there to chat and maybe help her clean a bit. You took it upon yourself to take it out of her wardrobe to show it to her which is a bit sketchy to me. There are tons of stories of actual caregivers convincing elderly people to give them things. Not saying that\u2019s the case.", "And you can see that this disbelief is part of the reasoning behind the ah verdict. Some people think that you are just a teen and only want the scarf because it's something shiny - and if that IS indeed the case, then I would think you are the ah. However I don't think this is the case, and the scarf is a gift from your bonus-grandma that you loved, and it connects you to her. Hence I have voted that you are not the ah.\n\nYou know what your motivation is though, so it's up to you to decide.", "It could be, but if you loved her..imagine how much they must have loved her, even more. Obviously it's not about money for the family, it's a scarf, but maybe a way of remembering both grandparents, and honouring them. Idk, maybe not the AH, but inconsiderate.", "I think it\u2019s an entirely reasonable assumption to make given that the family told OP that her friend had been declining mentally. Loss of judgement, such as being overly generous with money or gifts, is a common early sign of dementia, one that frequently precedes memory loss. It\u2019s one reason why elderly individuals are much more susceptible to scams and financial abuse, though I\u2019m not accusing OP of that. The deceased\u2019s children are way more likely to have known that this was a pattern or diagnosis than her teenage neighbor, even if they were close.", "This seems pretty unlikely.  How did all your neighbors know this scarf - that had been in the back of Anne's wardrobe for who knows how long - was hers? And know it well enough to be sure the one you were wearing was the same one? And happen to be outside every single day when you left your house to go to school? And be observant enough to notice and remember your scarf? And be physically close enough to identify it? And even if all of those unlikely things happened, why would they contact her family and let them know you had it? None of this really adds up.", "exactly. I've been married 26 years and i can't remember what either my wife or i wore on our first date.", "That\u2019s all still assumption.", "You do, and that is apparently correct, but plenty of people make that mistake", "In my family, our grandparents usually called us by our parents names since we were born, and until we got to our 20s or something (and established as adults in their eyes I guess). My uncle would call me by my cousin's name half the times. All of them in their 50s, btw.", "As a brit this isn\u2019t true for me, last february would mean feb 22 until next february, then it would be 23. \u201cIn february\u201d prefers to the most recent and \u201clast feb\u201d means the year before.", "Use words for their literal meanings?", "OP has answered this question several times. the family did not state how they knew OP had it, so OP can only assume they saw them wearing it around.", "I'm happy to vary exactly when the switchover happens, but definitely not all the way until the following Feb.\n\nie if in January 24 you said last February then I think only a very small number of people would think you meant anything but Feb 23.\n\nBut, it does vary across the country tbf.", "Disagree, because its about context, you would say \u201cI went skiing in feb\u201d", "Well exactly. And if you said you went skiing last Feb right now we'd be thinking of Feb 22", "i would think feb 22 if you added last yes. If we are in the same year last always means the year before for me."]}
