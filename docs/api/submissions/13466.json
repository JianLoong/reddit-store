They're the ones disrespecting her wishes.", "NTA, it was a gift. All they could do is ask nicely and explain why. Once they got the no they needed to back off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone is grieving here so emotions will be all over the place, so remember kindness (this doesn't mean giving in to demands) goes a long way.", "NTA. I don't know what country you come from, howvevere, if she gave it to you before she passed, it is legally yours.\n\nThey have no claim to a gift she gave you before she passed, period.\n\nETA: How did they find out she gave it to you? And did i understand correctly? This was gifted over a year ago?", "I think it's great that the scarf is going to continue to be worn (by someone whom Anne was obviously very fond of) rather than being buried in the ground and deteriorating, never to be seen again. Anne wanted you to have it, and you wearing it is a lovely way to keep her memory alive.", "NTA, but its a tough one, since it isn't about money or anything valuable, it seems to hold symbol with the family. She gave it to you, so you have every right to want to keep it, but the family want to lay her to rest in it and will be at a very emotional time for them. Personally I think I would give it back and maybe ask for a keep sake to remember her by in return. Either way NTA.", "91 year old people can still have their faculties\u2026 the important question is do you think she was sound of mind when she gave it you? if so NTA", "NTA. It sounded like she wanted you to have it", "NTA. It sounds like Anne gave the scarf to you fair and square, regardless of her mental state at the time. Her family are TA's. If you want to visit her grave (because you absolutely should if it's something that's important to you), make sure her family won't be there.", "Its funny she's apparently not in right state of mind but her family wasn't with her that day taking care of such an invalid. Yeah right.\nNTA", "INFO: how did the family find out that you gave it?", "NTA, she gave it to you without coercion.\n\nAnd if it's \"such an important piece of their family's history\", why are they going to put it in her grave where none of her family will ever see it, wear it, or appreciate its apparently massive historical significance...", "NTA she gave you the scarf it is yours. Sounds like you two had a special bond and she wanted you to have it. You aren\u2019t disrespectful of her memory but keeping her memory alive. The scarf was hers to do with as she wanted while alive. Now that she has died the family does not get to undo that. Sorry for your loss, I\u2019m sure you will miss your talks with her.", "How do they know Anne didn\u2019t want to pass on the scarf??? Maybe she thought it would bring you luck in meeting your future husband (or wife, I mean hey whatever floats your boat, babe). It\u2019s a sentimental gift given to you, you have no obligation to return it, family history or not. Now that bad boy is part of your history! A beautiful gift from your unofficial grandma <3 if she gave it to you I\u2019m sure she wanted to you to have it", "NTA.   \nAnne sounds like she wanted you to have it\u2026 and it\u2019s entirely possible she spent the last year of her life quietly happy that she gave it to a young woman who appreciated it. Maybe she day dreamed about it being around your neck when you meet your beau, or maybe she just enjoyed you wearing it and didn\u2019t want to see it go to waste. Maybe she just liked that you liked it.   \nWhatever it was\u2026 she gave it to you, and didn\u2019t put in her will stipulations I presume that it was what she was to be buried in. If it was that important to her she\u2019d have written it in her will.", "NTA. She gave it to you and that\u2019s all that matters. Enjoy the scarf.", "Actually, THEY are disrespecting her legacy, by not respecting that Anne gifted the scarf to you, the neighbor who visited her regularly for years.\n\nNTA\n\nUse the scarf in fond memory of Anne", "NTA\n\nShe gave it to you. Sadly grief can do weird things to people and cause anger over small things. Especially if they are sentimental about those things.", "This isn\u2019t technically a legacy, so know that first. She gave it to you\u2026that\u2019s it. If she REALLY wanted to have this item given to her family she would. Obviously this wasn\u2019t an item she really wasn\u2019t passion about. NTA, keep the scarf and move forward.", "NTA. You did NOT disrespect Anne. She gifted the scarf to YOU! That was what she wanted, and them taking it away would have upset her more! Anne had no plan to be buried with that scarf, that was something one of the family members came up with after the fact. The only people disappointed here was whichever person came up with this idea.  At 91 years old, Anne has a lifetime of 'stuff' with memories and they will find something else with sentimental symbolism to do.", "NTA", "NTA. Sorry for the loss of your friend. She wanted you to have it. May she RIP and you remember her fondly.", "Nta, I\u2019m sorry they made you feel that way but if she didn\u2019t have the mental capacity to make decisions then she should t have been alone. You keep that scarf and hold it as a gift from her.", "NTA\n\nMy daughter inherited an old ladies clothes, shoes, hats and bags. This woman had previously given my daughter various items that she no longer wanted. For the cremation, my daughter gave back the clothes and hats that she knew the old lady most liked regardless as to their real value knowing that they would be \u201clost\u201d. \n\nThis little old lady had been a seamstress for Dior, then a window-dresser for a high-end clothing store and finally had run a second hand dress agency in a well-to-do area so a lot of her stuff was vintage, high-end designer. She also had a lot of clothes that she had made herself that were of no value. That was irrelevant when my daughter was selecting her \u201cgoing away\u201d clothes. She instead made sure that she wore only her very best.\n\nAs an example - a basic Dior bucket hat from the 70\u2019s she sold for \u00a3150 on EBay. The hat that \u201cgot burnt\u201d was the one the lady had bought for the Queens Diamond Jubilee. She never checked who the milliner was - for all she knew it might have been valuable, but it was the ladies favourite hat.", "NTA - if they approach you again, tell them that you are respecting Anne's legacy by wearing the scarf and keeping the memory of her alive. Tell them that every time you wear the scarf you think of Anne, and also of that beautiful story of her meeting her husband. And as Anne wanted you to have the scarf, she would most likely appreciate that it brings fond memories rather than rot in her grave.", "NTA - Unless they were there when she gave it to you, they have no way to determine if \"she was in her right mind\" or not. I say this as someone who had a grandparent pass away last August from advanced Alzheimer's and Dementia, and was the only family member who spent any time with him.\n\nIt is very easy to tell when they are and are not aware of their surroundings. I don't know if this was the case with your neighbor, but either way, I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to you because you clearly spent a lot of time with her and bonded so you would know if something was off. Them taking away the scarf from you and burying it in the ground does nothing except take away your token of her memory and leaves the scarf where no one can use it, appreciate it or enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nI would personally have given it back.\n\nBut i don't think you're evil for keeping it", "NTA.\n\nI understand it holds sentimental value to the family but they plan to bury that sentiment into dirt.\n\nYou also have sentimental value to the scarf, this person seems like quite a big part of your childhood and a memory of them to keep is absolutely amazing and quite frankly the family should be happy to see that Anne gifted it to somebody she cared about.\n\nI'd say maintaining a sentimental item trumps burying it in the ground to rot. We waste way too much on the dead as it is.", "I would've gave the scarf back to them. But NTA, it's a gift, they should respect that. I can understand they are sad about not having the scarf back, but they are wrong to treat you like that. (Sorry for the bad english)", "NTA, I understand the sentimental value for both you and her family, but they shouldn't yell about it or be rude about you wanting to keep it. However it seems like they want the scarf for a good reason (since they want to put it in her grave). If they come back, apologize and ask politely, maybe consider giving it to them so she can be buried with it.", "NTA BUT I would advise to let them have this. Look, she did give it to you, she would have known what it meant, she didn't care. That's fine. But her family care and I think it'd be sweet to let them have it just for their peace of mind.", "YTA\u2026give the scarf back to the family. You\u2019re allowed to just let people who are mourning the loss of their matriarch have things that remind them of her.", "technically NTA as she did give it to you, and the family approached you way too aggresively, but cmon, they told you their plan is to put it in the grave where she will lie next to her husband... give them the scarf.", "NAH You're not TA for wanting to keep it as a sentiment from someone you liked and who gave it to you. But I think, for respectful reasons. You should have given it back. They weren't the AH for wanting to do something they thought she would've like them to do.\n\nEdit : I also think they could have dropped the subject bwfor eit got heated.", "NAH, but I do like the idea of putting the scarf in her grave to be honest. Seems symbolic and in a way romantic too. I'm not sure why you would be against it.\n\nAlso do you want to keep the scarf because it's pretty or because it reminds you of her?", "YTA going against the grain here - elderly folks often experience extreme changes in their ways of thinking toward the ends of their lives. It\u2019s possible that she forgot what the scarf meant to her and her family. Sometimes when folks are nearing their ends of lives they stop valuing possessions altogether. This is how many will wars start. And this is how caretakers and often influence their charges to change their wills to leave everything to them, instead of to offspring as originally intended. You should return the scarf\u2026", "NTA - the family is disrespecting her by not respecting her choices when she was alive.  Sounds like she also loved you and she wanted you to have the scarf.  Enjoy with good memories of her.", "NTA. That's yours, it was a gift. There is absolutely no reason to take it from you", "Info: was Anne senile when she gave you the scarf? If they have money, the determination and a medical report saying Anne was senile; they may try the legal route to get it back. \n\nDoesn't seem valuable but if it's important to them and they have the money, you may want to be sure whether Anne was senile or not.", "NAH. I believe both parties have their own fair arguments. But personally, I would hand over the scarf as for me it's not worth fighting over and hurting or getting hurt emotionally. But it is your final judgment that matters as the scarf ultimately belongs to you. If you are even now affected by it, it is better to decide on a course of action that you shouldn't regret later on or burden yourself with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are the pearls real?", "You disrespecting the dead by honouring her wish and not the wish of her family after her death? \ud83e\udd14\n\nNTA", "It was gifted to me last February, as in February of 2023", "Sounds like she was living alone. If the family didn\u2019t think she was in her right mind, then they were very irresponsible.", "They never told me exactly how they managed to find out but we live in a fairly small town and plenty of neighbors regularly saw me walking around wearing Anne's scarf and I even wore it to high school when it got really cold in late February so I assume someone must have told them.", "They were not there when she gave it to me. I'm obviously not an expert on these things, but Anne never showed any signs of Dementia. She sometimes forgot a few things like what day of the week it was or where she had put her purse and also sometimes called me by my mother's name and minor mistakes like that. But she was always aware of who I was and perfectly remembered anecdotes from her past and everyone involved in them.", "It\u2019s not what SHE wanted done with scarf before she died. She gave it to someone who expressed appreciation for it. She might prefer that it be used and loved rather than going to waste deteriorating next to her decomposing body. OP should not give up the scarf.", "Right, where it will either be destroyed by weather, stolen, or one of the kids will take it for themselves when the neighbour wanted her to have it.", "I want to keep it because she gave it to me as a gift and also because it's pretty and really warm too, I made good use of it during late February and early March when it got really cold in my local area.\n\nI understand her family's motives, but they approached me almost as if I had stolen it from them while Anne gave it to me!", "Elderly people often are less set on holding onto their possessions because they know they are going to die and can\u2019t take things with them. Leaving everything to their caretakers is not frequent. Wanting people to have things to remember you by and use things that you cannot or do not anymore is common.", "We can't really know what was going through Anne's mind when she decided to give the scarf to OP. Who is anyone to judge  if that decision was valid or not? I've known several elderly people who are around the same age as Anne and some who are even older and are still perfectly able to think rationally and make decisions for themselves.\n\nI understand thr symbolic value that scarf holds for her grieving family, but it was Anne's wish to give it to OP! \n\nAnd let's be honest, having it burried alongside her and her husband is really touching, but eventually it's going to rot in the ground while OP's gonna make a much better use of it by wearing it, which she has all the right to do because Anne willingly gave it to her!", "Well no matter what it is still a gift she gave you. I thought i read it wrong and it was gifted feb 2022, not that it changes anything.\n\nWhat would have been appropriate was if they had come by your house asking politely for the scarf. Offering you a different item for the scarf she gave you. I do understand the sentimental value but at the end of the day it is yours to do with as you please. And honestly, it's just going to be burned, kind of a shame.\n\nAlso bear in mind the grief they are going through. I know from experience, you do not think clearly when you just lost a parent.", "NTA - you made no secret of having it, so the family had plenty of time to approach you in a polite manner and ask for it back if it really meant that much to them. Or they could have asked the neighbour who told them to intercede on their behalf. Grief does funny things to people but I suspect that it\u2019s not about sentimental meaning - if they wanted back for personal reasons, they had plenty of time to ask so I suspect they are just pissed off that they don\u2019t have ALL of her property and that she liked you enough to give you a personal gift.", "So it's not been a secret you had it before she passed.", "From what you say it doesn't seem like she was of sound mind. Dementia patients often flash back to old stories and have trouble with day to day memories like newer names", "Destroyed by weather? it will literally be buried, ofc it will deteriorate mate.\n\nEDIT: Also, you think people will rob a grave for a scarf?", "Personally I'd give it back, the way I see it its symbolic because Anna is going to see her husband again in a way, so it would seem fitting for her to have the same scarf she first met him with. Maybe I'm just too cheesy. Obviously you don't have to.", "Exactly, she gave it to me before she passed.", "Eh, I'm 35 and not currently working due to  disability (so I don't leave the house super often), and I often don't know what day of the week it is, forget where I left my bag, and use the wrong name for people. I've been known to call my partner of five years by my ex's name on occasion. I just have ADHD, am bad with names, and don't leave the house that often; I don't have dementia.", "I think it's a reach to say that from a few minor issues she must have had dementia - especially as sometimes people are just old, or tired, or mistaken.", "They aren\u2019t going to dig up and open her coffin to put it in with her now. That\u2019s just not reasonable. They might have wanted to put it with her before she was buried but that ship has sailed. The scarf should stay with OP.", "Oh my bad, I misread the post and thought it said \"on\" her grave, like on the headstone. Apologies.", "Enjoy the gift, the family won't miss it because they were going to stick it in the ground anyway (so they claim). \nMy grandmother before she passed started handing out items she wanted ppl to have so it was clear who she wanted to get what. \nI really believe someone wanted the item.", "And you are 35, not 90 so that isn't a good comparison on how decision making declines with old age.", "I didn't say she had dementia, I just was saying that dementia patients often remember the past. I said she wasn't of sound mind. But I did say what some dementia patients experience. I work in hospice. Many patients who are deemed by a doctor as no longer able to make their own decisions can't remember what day it is (or year), can't always remember the names of those close to them, don't always remember the significance of an item and will happily give anything away and often times they can still live alone if the family has made sure the home is safe and the patient is not a danger to them selves.\n\nDementia patients often times can tell you about the past like it was yesterday. But they can't always tell you what they actually did yesterday.", "I'm pointing out that forgetting little things like that isn't a sign of dementia, dude."]}
