Instead of dealing with her disorganisation, they've created conflict. Further, you should check whether parental status is a protected class in your area/state/country. If it is, you're likely protected *regardless* of whether or not you have kids, they can't discriminate against you for having children *or* not having children.

NO ONE was sad to see her go.", "Ditto. I lost my father earilier this year and was only 71. EVERY second is precious.", "Agreed. My dad has Parkinson's and has a limited number of Christmases left. I want to savour every one. I don't have to work Christmas at my job but if I did, and a coworker with children tried to guilt me into swapping, I would raise merry hell.", ">I don't know where you live, but where I do the kids go back to school on Jan 2nd if it falls on a weekday. If it's the same where you live, she would be home alone unless she planned to pull the kids from school\n\nWhere I am, they're going back on the 8th this year (2 week holiday, breaking up Friday 22nd) - suspect op is somewhere with similar holidays.", "This is what I\u2019m saying. Some people choose to not have kids or don\u2019t have contact with family. It doesn\u2019t mean their time is less valuable to them. They went through the proper channels  to get their time off and now they can spend it any way they please. That is that.", "It totally depends the place. In my country every schools are closed 25/12 to 05/01 by national holidays calendar.", "Most are closed for a week or two BUT the school calendar is usually issued almost a full year before. At the very least before school starts but usually the school board approves in February of that year if it is a single year or they will approve multiple years. It depends on the teachers union. It would be HIGHLY unusual for there to be a shift once the school year starts (like, COVID unusual).", "We have schools on a year-round calendar that don't go back until almost mid-January. \n\nBest winter vacation we ever had was when my son was on that schedule and we went to Disney World after everyone else returned to school...no crowds at all, and the weather wasn't too hot either.", "That's what I don't get when people lean on single or married w/o kids people this way. Do they not think these folks have parents, siblings, niblings, cousins, etc.? It's really ridiculous!", "I mean from where do people even get this sort of audacity??", "Veronique is a lovely name. I\u2019m totally picturing mod tweed mini skirts and ski lodges.", "This is wild", "How are people so self centered ?", "Boss sounds like an asshole too. He should've told her to step off and deal with it after you said no the first time, instead of sending her back to you to discuss it again.", "Even if someone were completely alone in the world, why should they be denied the opportunity to take time off and enjoy the holiday season?\n\nA few days of cozy hibernation watching Christmas movies and drinking mugs of tea/hot-chocolate/mulled wine, during the darkest part of winter is wonderfully restorative. \n\nAs is enjoying the festive atmosphere and activities of your community to feel like a part of something bigger than yourself.\n\nOr jetting off to find some sunshine in an exotic locale, make those trips while you can because it'll be a lot harder after having children.\n\nIt could simply be that nothing is more depressing for a single person during the holidays than going into work when there's very little company to be had at your place of work. Mental health is highly important for single people as there's no one to rely on when yours takes a downturn.", "WOLF FAMILY!", "I, too, was raised by wolves.  They're good people, but have terrible table manners and their hair gets everywhere.", "What kind of life did you lead to have being part of a wolf family a regular occurrence? o.0", "I'd trade some of my family for wolves without hesitating.", "Ah well, I think it's perfectly believable and we will probably get a few other posts like this with the holidays coming up. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.\n\nBut I hope you'll get better soon!", "Well, at least you reflected and are aware of it. Hope you feel better soon.", "That sounds like my fathers side of the family. They\u2019re Italian.\n\nEdit: I was referring to the excessive body hair. Not the poor table manners. I\u2019m sure their table manners would be equally as bad if they weren\u2019t Italian too.", "You\u2019re so lucky! I wish I had been raised by wolves! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a", "But least they don't drink too much and then cause arguments:-)", "Mowgli has entered the chat.", "Bet he presented for his equal share of inheritance if any. Equal in the spoils but not the work.", "I was about to write this. Great cynics think alike:-)"]}
