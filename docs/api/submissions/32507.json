You have plans, you requested the leave. End of story. If it were a matter of working Christmas Day itself and a colleague had a 3-6 year old, I MIGHT consider swapping. But after New Year? Nope, a thousand times nope.\n\nAnd Tell HR she\u2019s creating a hostile working environment.", "No. What you respond with is:\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way. Next time put in for leave in advance like everyone else - your lack of planning is not my emergency and I will not be changing my plans. Particularly now, after you have gone around disparaging me. Your behavior is HIGHLY unprofessional. Find someone else to switch with and stop harassing me.\"\n\nBCC HR, your boss and your manager on the email when you send it to her.", "NTA. I have young kids who still do the Santa thing and being with them for Christmas is really important to me. So you know what I do? Am the very first one to ask for leave at this time to be sure my supervisor knows and I\u2019m approved. This year I got it approved in July.", "NTA If it were truly important to her she would have applied early and made sure she knew what she had to do.\n\nThere will always be cases like this. People without kids would *never* get any holiday time off if parents like this had their way. That's why there is no point feeling guilty whatsoever.\n\nIf she keeps badmouthing you around the office I'd go to HR about it.\n\nETA: If you do go to HR, you might want to indirectly (and carefully) suggest that workers shouldn't be told that they can get time off anyway even if they didn't apply properly by trying to get another worker to give up their time. Your boss saying that is what set all this off.", "NTA. This is on her and you should likely tell HR. Her behavior is 100% unacceptable. And just because people have kids doesn't mean their off time is more important.", "NTA. You are the child of two parents, maybe siblings, and presumably have aunts, uncles and cousins. All of this equals family.  That you also could be spending time with. \n\nShe ruined her own holiday season by not planning better.", "Ugh I hate people that act like just because you don't have kids the holidays shouldn't mean as much or something. I left a job because of that. NTA if anything send her email to HR and let them know what she's doing. If your petty like me I'd start showing people the email and show them how your requested the extra days off as you were instructed to do!", "NTA this is BS you have a family also! You just don\u2019t have a bunch of kids. It\u2019s ok to take time off for holidays even if you had no family. You got your time in on time she did not.", "NTA. Excuse me? *You have family, too*. \n\nJust because it doesn't look like hers, doesn't make it any less valid or important.\n\nFrom a HR perspective, it wasn't fair to anyone who participated in the system correctly to tell her that she could only have it if one of you handed it back. Instead of dealing with her disorganisation, they've created conflict. Further, you should check whether parental status is a protected class in your area/state/country. If it is, you're likely protected *regardless* of whether or not you have kids, they can't discriminate against you for having children *or* not having children. This would extend to protecting you from discrimination by a colleague. If she's singling you out because you don't have kids, if she's telling you you aren't as important because of your parental status, that's discrimination.", "NTA failure to plan on her part does not constitute an emergancy on your part. Breeders always thinking their entitled special treatment because i Haz KiDz!!  Enjoy your holiday leave and don't give this spoiled fool another thought", "NTA her bad planning is not your responsible. Just because you don't have children don't mean you don't have family.", "NTA she ruined her holiday plans by not putting in the days that had nothing to do with you \u2026 and that email would\u2019ve received a nice corporate curse out", "NTA. \n\nShe ruined her own holiday by not putting in for the extra time off like everyone else.  You not having kids doesn't make your time off any less important, btw.", "Easy NTA and her kids are not relevant in any way. \n\nEnjoy your holiday, guilt free. And any hostile behavior from her should be documented for reporting.", "NTA she had the exact time frame to put in for days off. Just because she can't follow directions, doesn't mean you should suffer. Obviously doesn't love her kids enough to follow an email thread.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t put in for the time like she was supposed to that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA, being single doesn\u2019t mean you should be working and can\u2019t have Holidays leave. You did as you\u2019re supposed to, give the request early. She didn\u2019t. Just like Stewie said, her poor planning does not constitute an emergency, she\u2019ll see her kids after working.", "NTA. \nShe needs to he more organised. Just because you dont have kids doesnt mean you dont have a life or family to spend time with. \n\nEven if you just want to spend your time being a couch potato on your own, thats your choice and you applied for leave correctly to do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
