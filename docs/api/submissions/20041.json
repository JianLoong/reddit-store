Or were your parents trying to put it off until things handled themselves.", "There was never a hair appointment.", "I think the parents are trying to hold onto the hair because as long as she has hair, she's \"normal.\"  Once her head is shaved, they can't deny the cancer diagnosis.\n\nI worked in a children's hospital for 15 years and this scenario is more common than you'd think.", "Yup, sometimes chemo is first. Sometimes radiation is first. And I wasn't attacking anyone. I was pointing out that the timeline makes no sense. It still doesn't. If you have so many cancer survivors, I would think you would know the timeline between diagnosis, treatment of any kind, and hair falling out. Do the math.", "Ah, allow me to clarify. I was apologizing for my attitude and approach. We should all be allowed to grieve in whatever way we need, provided it is not at the expense of others in pain. I thought to include an explanation of the particulars of why I reacted unproductively harshly to your comments and overall demeanor, but wanted to be clear that I was not apologizing for the core message.", "Chemo is very often done before surgery to shrink a tumor to make it easier to remove (or surgery may not happen at all depending on the type of brain cancer it is). And unlike radio which can have a lot more prep before it begins, chemo can begin very soon after diagnosis, even immediately. \n\nOP is 13 years old, so she cut with scissors first, maybe she didn't know how to use the clippers. \n\nMaybe the parents made an appointment cause they just wanted it professionally done.\n\nNothing in this story is unbelievable.", "Yes, that's why your \"apology\" isn't an apology. Do the math. If you know anything about cancer you will see that her timeline is impossible. Do... the... math.", "You're making up stuff. From diagnosis to beginning any sort of treatment, even aggressive treatment, to hair falling out... it's not a legit timeline. A buzzcut is a walk-in. There isn't a single hairstylist on the planet that would hear this story and say, \"I can only squeeze her in three weeks from now. Sorry.\" They would  literally be able to fit her in and have her done in less than a minute. And if a hairstylist DID say something so unbelievable, you would take your kid somewhere else. The whole story is unbelievable.", "My first comment included the forgiveness of truncated timelines. We are talking about a child recounting an emotionally charged story for strangers. So what if it was three months instead of one, or two weeks instead of three? I did the math before I told you to cool it the first time.\n\nEdit: the comment beneath this one is a strawman argument, we're done here.", "Dude you\u2019re in AITA. Obviously there\u2019s gonna be fake or exaggerated stories. You make your judgment regardless and move on, not continuously whine about how you think this one\u2019s fake or that one\u2019s fake. You\u2019re being The Asshole.", "It can absolutely happen that quickly, depending on the type of cancer. There is one very fast growing brain cancer that occurs rather often in children, which also happens to respond well to chemo. If treatment is aggressive (which it probably would be for a brain cancer) it can be given within a week, and hair loss can happen within a week of starting chemo.\n\nWe also don't know how long the process of diagnosis took. One month ago may have easily been the final confirmation of diagnosis after who knows how long of testing, and in all that time the preparation for treatment could have been ongoing.", "So you're now claiming that she doesn't know when she was diagnosed with cancer in order to make the math work. Yeah, that's what I thought.", "I will reply to anyone I feel like, in the manner I choose. I asked a question, which is one of the ways you interact with an OP. Other people (not the OP) tried to act like they knew what was going on. I have argued that they don't. You can pretend I'm whining if that helps you with your ad hominem attack, but I'm actually being quite level-headed about this considering my experience with cancer. But I'm not at all surprised that you have ignored the rules of AITA to baselessly insult me. Well done.", "Sorry, but you don't know what you're talking about.", "Hanlon's Razor, my guy.", "I'm sure if the situation had been explained to any decent hairdresser they would've fitted you in within a couple of days by either rearranging appointments opening early or staying open late to accommodate you. This was about your parents trying to control what was happening rather than taking your feelings into account. Well done to your big brother for doing what your parents ought to have done.", "NTA. Your hair is falling out and you have an appointment to get it all shaved off; what do they think the hairdresser is going to do that you and your brother didn\u2019t do between you? If there\u2019s such a delay with the hairdresser, far better to just cancel the appointment and deal with it at home rather than leave it to cause you unnecessary stress. Sounds like your parents just didn\u2019t want to face reality. Hope all goes well with your treatment.", "NTA. It's easy to think the parents are wrong here, but everyone is just dealing with too much the best way they know how. Your parents should have accepted your need to move more quickly on the hair, and not gone off at you about it. It's probably good that you did, though, because hopefully it will teach them to listen to you about how the the treatments are effecting you. Good luck! I hope you recover quickly and completely.", "NTA. people who haven't gone through chemo or don't understand the process see cutting the hair as like, an experience. I blame those emotional YouTube and TikTok videos. The truth is, having your hair fall out in clumps when your scalp is so sensitive is itchy, painful, awful. I worked in clinical trials and had a patient who after only one cycle of chemo shaved her head because it was already that uncomfortable. Making you wait would be unfair, and it's not like the hairdresser could have done a much better job than anyone in your family with scissors and an electric razor. Good luck sweetheart.", "Babe I\u2019m 30 and I cut my hair every time. Your NTA. Remind them that you\u2019re going through cancer and they need to be more helpful.", "I don\u2019t know anywhere that has a 3 week waiting period to get a haircut. If that was truly the case, I\u2019m sure there were other places that could have booked you in sooner. I think this is more your parents weren\u2019t ready for it and that doesn\u2019t make them right. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this and I hope everything works out for you. NTA", "NTA just tell them that you're the one suffering the cancer and you want all the comfort you can get, how damn hard is it to help you shave your head? Who wastes money to shave the head?", "NTA.\n\nThis is a weird hill for your parents to die on, is there something special about cancer hair?\n\nAlso I suspect your parents had a surprise planned or something as a 3 week appointment to just shave off all the hair  seems to me to be excessive.", "NTA. Why are they so concerned with the appt? S/o your brother", "You are the one who is ill and living with this! Your parents can go into their room until they're ready to be reasonable. Your brother, who is probably not an adult, was trying to get them away. Why did you need to wait for a hair dresser? Shorter hair isn't going to fix this. \n\nYou aren't acting out! We need to start requiring child care classes for parents. Yes, I can think of 50 reasons why that's hard but people need to learn to deal like adults. NTA.", "NTA: your parents really were not taking your feelings into account. I'd also think taking care of this at home with your brother was much better than having to go through it at a hairdresser.  It's done and gone and they should just drop it and move on.", "Idk if the story is true, but my experience is that it can take 2, 3 or more weeks to get an appointment at the kind of hair salon women typically use, while men can just walk into a barber shop without an appointment. That\u2019s because women\u2019s hair typically takes a lot longer, while my husband\u2019s haircut takes maybe 6 minutes tops. \n\nI don\u2019t know any hair salons around here where you can just walk in. However, given that OP just wanted to have her hair cut off, maybe a local barber shop would have been the way to go. Or the parents could have done it at home.", "Right? I live in a suburb of a small city now and there are five hair places in walking distance. The parents are lying. Three weeks. Right.", "I know the timeline varies widely depending on how quickly the cancer was diagnosed, how intensive a program of chemo is applied, the health of the patient to begin with, an hell, even the health and condition of the patients scalp and hair. \n\nDoing the maths is accurate only when you have all the variables - we don't here. One uncle - balding for years, out of shape, stomach cancer not noticed till a third of his already substantial gut was a tumor, and yet the twelve strands of hair he had left on his head beforehand survived through his entire treatment. My sister's hair began falling out, slowly at first but accellerated rapidly from the five weeks mark of her first round of chemo for leukemia. Which began the week she was diagnosed. Again, both the disease and the treatment hit everyone differently. Speed of diagnoses to treatment also varies widely from state to state, country to country - hell even in one hospital two specialists will recommend different speeds and intensities of treatment for the same case. \n\nOn top of all this - a 13 year old kid is typing up their reaction to an utter skunner of a situation. You like maths, right? You never round up or down? Never lose track of exact timings because of a stressful situation? Never heard of acute cases being given priority referrals to maximise chances of survival?", "NTA.\n\nYour hair belongs to you and you should be the only person who decides what you want to do with it (cancer or not).\n\nYou raised the issue a number of times to them to no effect and eventually felt you needed to take matters into you own hands. Your brother simply helped you out and IMHO was a legend for doing so.\n\nSeeing you go through this must be bad for your family but they need to think what YOU are feeling atm and make that the most important factor.", "NTA. Your parents are the selfish assholes not you hun", "Your parents never heard you. \n\nA number of years ago, my friend went through chemo. She was an adult.  I helped her shave her head.  It was a wonderful bonding experience and something that I think she will always remember.  I know I will.\n\nNTA", "Hugs to you. This isn\u2019t you acting out. This is you advocating for yourself, which is an important skill to have as a cancer patient, and unfortunately one you will probably need to exercise again in the near future. You will most likely have to speak up to your nurses and doctors when they might not be hearing you about your symptoms or concerns. They can best help you when they know what\u2019s going on and what you need. \nAlso, I don\u2019t think people who haven\u2019t had their hair fall out due to chemo understand that it is physically uncomfortable to have your hair fall out like this. What you and your brother did was completely reasonable. (One of the best tips I learned was you can use a sticky lint roller to get the stubble off your scalp if that starts to hurt too!)\nedited: NTA", "If there were clippers in the house and your parents didn't buzz your head the second you asked, then they are massive assholes.\n\nWhat was even the point of an \"appointment\"?

It's your hair and you are dealing with a very, very difficult situation. I am sorry your parents were not more supportive about this.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. The thing is that I feel like your parents are in some sort of denial.\nThis haircut isn\u2019t for fashion purposes. Every day your hair fell added another layer to your trauma.\nI can\u2019t even imagine being 13 and going through that. \nIt wasn\u2019t about about a haircut. It wasn\u2019t even obeying or disobeying them, it was about stopping a prolonged traumatic step in your illness and they kept on pushing it back for some unknown reason.\n\nAsk them this, if one of the symptoms was that you were losing blood from a cut on your face and you could only get a Dr\u2019s appointment in 3 weeks and you decide to clean it and put a band-aid on it, would they have the same reaction?\n\nThis is the exact same thing.\n\nLike you said, yes, they are having a hard time. But you\u2019re the one with the sickness. \nIt seems to me that there is a level of denial and avoidance on their part.\n\nYou told them several times.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an aesthetic choice, it was a survival one.\nThis was no different than taking medication for your pain.\n\nKeep on fighting girl! You are very strong and brave.", "NTA but if you are in the US I don\u2019t understand why you had to wait. There are many hair cut places that take walk in. I wonder what their issue was since they were giving your brother crap.", "NTA- but your parents dang, they can use a couple Lessons in body autonomy and empathy.\n\nStay strong and take care of yourself. You are so young but focus on your body and needs right now. Self care will become so\nImportant in the conking weeks.", "NTA, you're the one with cancer! If they're scared, how must you be feeling?

Shaving your head is the easiest hairstyle to do on your own.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI suspect your parents are in denial and pretending everything is really \"OK\".  \n\n\nSo, do what you need to, but be kind and patient with them.

You're old enough to make this decision on your own.", "Oh sweetie - I wish I could give you a huge hug. Cancer survivor here. I shaved my head even before it started falling out... I had read somewhere that waking up to clumps of hair on your pillowcase was pretty depressing and I agreed! There's not a lot you can control at the beginning of treatment, but that was one thing I could. Good for you! Control what you can. Hopefully your parents will figure out how to support you. Everyone is stressed for sure, and nothing feels normal right now, because it isn't. I wish you ALL the best. Cancer sucks. But there is support, not just for you but also for your parents.", "NTA. There's no age cutoff for cutting your own hair. There's times where it's not the best idea, but this was not one of them. During COVID, lots of us had to - my hair grew too long and was seriously uncomfortable so had to cut it for my own sanity. So I can empathise with hair being super annoying. They could've found a hairdresser with availability if all you really needed was a buzz cut. As with the others, kinda suspect your parents aren't dealing too well and don't want to accept the fact you're going to be very shorthaired/bald for at least awhile.

There is generally some cush room for hair emergencies at most places.", "I think they probably thought it could be styled into something short and cute so that it wouldn't all have to be shaved off.\n\nI don't think they understand how painful the hair loss is for a cancer patient.
