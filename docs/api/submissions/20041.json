Your parents are horrible. \\*hugs\\* to you, hang in there. Hoping for the best.", "Nah. I think your parents wanted to be there with you. \n\nI'm so sorry", "NTA. Don't feel bad. it's your hair. Is it common where you live to have to wait that long for an appointment ? Or were your parents trying to put it off until things handled themselves.", "There was never a hair appointment.", "I think the parents are trying to hold onto the hair because as long as she has hair, she's \"normal.\"  Once her head is shaved, they can't deny the cancer diagnosis.\n\nI worked in a children's hospital for 15 years and this scenario is more common than you'd think.", "Yup, sometimes chemo is first. Sometimes radiation is first. And I wasn't attacking anyone. I was pointing out that the timeline makes no sense. It still doesn't. If you have so many cancer survivors, I would think you would know the timeline between diagnosis, treatment of any kind, and hair falling out. Do the math.", "Ah, allow me to clarify. I was apologizing for my attitude and approach. We should all be allowed to grieve in whatever way we need, provided it is not at the expense of others in pain. I thought to include an explanation of the particulars of why I reacted unproductively harshly to your comments and overall demeanor, but wanted to be clear that I was not apologizing for the core message.", "Chemo is very often done before surgery to shrink a tumor to make it easier to remove (or surgery may not happen at all depending on the type of brain cancer it is). And unlike radio which can have a lot more prep before it begins, chemo can begin very soon after diagnosis, even immediately. \n\nOP is 13 years old, so she cut with scissors first, maybe she didn't know how to use the clippers. \n\nMaybe the parents made an appointment cause they just wanted it professionally done.\n\nNothing in this story is unbelievable.", "Yes, that's why your \"apology\" isn't an apology. Do the math. If you know anything about cancer you will see that her timeline is impossible. Do... the... math.", "You're making up stuff. From diagnosis to beginning any sort of treatment, even aggressive treatment, to hair falling out... it's not a legit timeline. A buzzcut is a walk-in. There isn't a single hairstylist on the planet that would hear this story and say, \"I can only squeeze her in three weeks from now. Sorry.\" They would  literally be able to fit her in and have her done in less than a minute. And if a hairstylist DID say something so unbelievable, you would take your kid somewhere else. The whole story is unbelievable.", "My first comment included the forgiveness of truncated timelines. We are talking about a child recounting an emotionally charged story for strangers. So what if it was three months instead of one, or two weeks instead of three? I did the math before I told you to cool it the first time.\n\nEdit: the comment beneath this one is a strawman argument, we're done here.", "Dude you\u2019re in AITA. Obviously there\u2019s gonna be fake or exaggerated stories. You make your judgment regardless and move on, not continuously whine about how you think this one\u2019s fake or that one\u2019s fake. You\u2019re being The Asshole.", "It can absolutely happen that quickly, depending on the type of cancer. There is one very fast growing brain cancer that occurs rather often in children, which also happens to respond well to chemo. If treatment is aggressive (which it probably would be for a brain cancer) it can be given within a week, and hair loss can happen within a week of starting chemo.\n\nWe also don't know how long the process of diagnosis took. One month ago may have easily been the final confirmation of diagnosis after who knows how long of testing, and in all that time the preparation for treatment could have been ongoing.", "So you're now claiming that she doesn't know when she was diagnosed with cancer in order to make the math work. Yeah, that's what I thought.", "I will reply to anyone I feel like, in the manner I choose. I asked a question, which is one of the ways you interact with an OP. Other people (not the OP) tried to act like they knew what was going on. I have argued that they don't. You can pretend I'm whining if that helps you with your ad hominem attack, but I'm actually being quite level-headed about this considering my experience with cancer. But I'm not at all surprised that you have ignored the rules of AITA to baselessly insult me. Well done.", "Sorry, but you don't know what you're talking about.", "Hanlon's Razor, my guy."]}
