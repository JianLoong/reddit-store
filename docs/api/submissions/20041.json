Definitely. \n\nI don't know your parents and if they are good parents otherwise but in that specific situation they are the AH. They shouldn't do this to you. Only explanation I have is that it is hard for them to see you without hair. On top of all of it. \n\nBut they really should pull themselves together for you. They should be the strong ones for you. And it's not about them in that situation but about you. You did act very mature in all of this they unfortunately not so much.

Here's a virtual hug :)", "I'm so sorry, about all of it. Your parents should not be forcing you to do extra things that are uncomfortable. Being ill involves tests and treatments that sometimes suck. Anything you can do to be more comfortable, you should do. And you should tell your parents this. That cutting your hair wasn't about going behind their backs, it was about **you** having control of your body and being as comfortable as possible. \n\nOne of my good friends was diagnosed with cancer recently, in her 40's. And she buzzed her hair before it started falling out, because that felt better to her. What you did is completely normal. You should be able to do whatever feels best. \n\nHere's my thought, \"Mom/Dad, I'm sorry I upset you by cutting my hair. But I need you to understand that I need a little control over my body right now. And having itchy,  clumpy hair that was falling out felt awful - it was so uncomfortable and I just had to watch it keep happening. I know everyone is very stressed out right now. But, please, don't force me to go behind your backs to be comfortable. I deserve all the comfort I can get.\" \n\nGood luck with your treatment, I hope it kicks cancer's butt.", "Your head, your hair, your feelings! Of course it was OK for you to cut off your hair and have your brother shave your head for you.  You weren't acting out, which implies doing something negative; you were doing something positive for yourself.  I'm sure that if your parents understood this they wouldn't be upset with you.\n\nIt's really hard to cope with cancer.  I want to suggest that you ask your parents or your doctor if you can have a counselor to help you through it.  I'm sure your family loves you so much and is trying their hardest, but sometimes it's helpful to also get support from someone outside your family, so you can talk about the kind of things you're posting here.\n\nWishing you all the best!\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
