Sometimes radiation is first. And I wasn't attacking anyone. I was pointing out that the timeline makes no sense. It still doesn't.

And unlike radio which can have a lot more prep before it begins, chemo can begin very soon after diagnosis, even immediately. \n\nOP is 13 years old, so she cut with scissors first, maybe she didn't know how to use the clippers. \n\nMaybe the parents made an appointment cause they just wanted it professionally done.\n\nNothing in this story is unbelievable.", "Yes, that's why your \"apology\" isn't an apology. Do the math. If you know anything about cancer you will see that her timeline is impossible. Do... the... math.", "You're making up stuff. From diagnosis to beginning any sort of treatment, even aggressive treatment, to hair falling out... it's not a legit timeline. A buzzcut is a walk-in. There isn't a single hairstylist on the planet that would hear this story and say, \"I can only squeeze her in three weeks from now. Sorry.\" They would  literally be able to fit her in and have her done in less than a minute. And if a hairstylist DID say something so unbelievable, you would take your kid somewhere else. The whole story is unbelievable.", "My first comment included the forgiveness of truncated timelines. We are talking about a child recounting an emotionally charged story for strangers.

There is one very fast growing brain cancer that occurs rather often in children, which also happens to respond well to chemo. If treatment is aggressive (which it probably would be for a brain cancer) it can be given within a week, and hair loss can happen within a week of starting chemo.\n\nWe also don't know how long the process of diagnosis took. One month ago may have easily been the final confirmation of diagnosis after who knows how long of testing, and in all that time the preparation for treatment could have been ongoing.", "So you're now claiming that she doesn't know when she was diagnosed with cancer in order to make the math work.

One uncle - balding for years, out of shape, stomach cancer not noticed till a third of his already substantial gut was a tumor, and yet the twelve strands of hair he had left on his head beforehand survived through his entire treatment. My sister's hair began falling out, slowly at first but accellerated rapidly from the five weeks mark of her first round of chemo for leukemia. Which began the week she was diagnosed. Again, both the disease and the treatment hit everyone differently. Speed of diagnoses to treatment also varies widely from state to state, country to country - hell even in one hospital two specialists will recommend different speeds and intensities of treatment for the same case. \n\nOn top of all this - a 13 year old kid is typing up their reaction to an utter skunner of a situation.

Op you're absolutely NTA and your parents shouldn't be taking this out on you.", "If a parent called and said \u201cmy child had cancer and is in pain from losing hair - can you please help?\u201d then most salons are going to fit them in faster than 3 weeks out. \n\nThis was the parents trying to delay the inevitable. They did not care about her physical pain.", "My dude look at the nuance. It\u2019s not a fantasy - it\u2019s 100% parents in denial", "As a parent who's lost a child it's not the same situation as hers but i can say it's hard, my son passed very suddenly and i cant imagine what it would be like if i also had to see a child of mine go through cancer or other illness and not saying shes dying or dead just offering perspective of the parents here. They definitely want to feel in control is my thought. In a time when nothing is in their control. But with that being said she is definitely not the asshole at all. It's not her job to make her parents feel better through this. She is the child. I know it's hard on their end but it needed to be done for the child's comfort and I'm glad the brother stepped up and did what the parents couldn't. This situation is so awful and sad and scary and the parents need to put their own thoughts and fears aside and help the daughter through this. I am so sorry that you have to go through this OP. I will be thinking of you through this and hoping for the best possible outcome! Kick this cancers ass \u2764\ufe0f", "Oh maybe it\u2019s just a bullshit post.", "That is why I\u2019d said a local barber shop would probably have been the way to go if the parents couldn\u2019t get a faster appointment at a traditional salon. While places like Supercuts are common in big cities, they aren\u2019t always available in small cities or rural towns such the area where I live, which doesn\u2019t have any. \n\nIn any case, the parents could have shaved her hair at home. During the pandemic period when hairdressers were closed, I cut my own (long) hair and did my husband\u2019s short hair with clippers. It\u2019s not hard, I just watched a YouTube video.", "Absolutely true! Any hairdresser with a heart would respond to such a plea! The parents should be ashamed of themselves for 1) not doing this and 2) scolding their child with cancer until she was crying for taking action on her own to solve this painful problem. I am disgusted with them, they are flaming AHs and OP deserves much, much better from them. Have they no compassion at all?", "It wasn\u2019t, but they likely felt like it was. If they maintained some sense of normalcy maybe everything would be ok. They likely wanted something they felt like they could control, because their lives feel very out of control right now. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not ok, but it\u2019s a very normal response.", "Id see exactly why they'd want OP to keep it a little longer (assuming they just wanted it to stay appearing normal for some more time). But taking into consideration what OP had to deal with having the hair, I still completely agree with their decision. \n\nI just hope in the end everything goes well for OP and their family\ud83d\ude4f", "why the hell are they making this about them? NTA op, and I'm sorry about your diagnosis", "NTA. I am assuming your parents are stressed about your health so I am going to give them a pass. Lots of props to your brother for being so supportive and understanding.\n\nMy husband had this issue when he had cancer. He couldn't stand to see it coming off in clumps in the shower and it was really itchy. So one day while I was at work, he took his electric razor and tried to shave his head. Razor died half way through. I came home to him in tears saying his hair was driving him crazy and he just wanted it gone. Frankly, we had more important things to worry about than hair.\n\nWe slapped a hat on his head and went to Target and got another razor. I finished the job when we got home. His hair, his choice. (It was winter so I did get him a beanie to keep his head warm). It grew back when his treatment was over.  And honestly it is kinda silly to make a hair appointment to shave your head... Good luck and keep your chin up.", "NTA.  I have a really hard time believing that if your parents explained to the shop the reason for the cut, that the shop would not have bent over backwards to fit you in.  They were holding on to your hair for their own reasons, denial.", "NTA. Honey it\u2019s your hair. It\u2019s your body. You\u2019re going through this physically. Not them. \n\nYou have every right to cut your hair. It\u2019s your hair. You\u2019ve don\u2019t absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nThey probably wanted to hole onto your likeness as long as they could as they realize that this cancer is changing everything.  \n\nEveryone needs to show grace to everyone in this situation. But that onus is not on you. You\u2019re a child going through a horrible ordeal. They are adults and should be better at sorting through their feelings. \n\nI\u2019m sorry they put the burden of their angst on you. \n\nSending you love and strength.", "> and that i\u2019m way too old to be cutting my own hair\n\n...I'm 33.. and granted a guy that does a buzz with clippers, but i cut my own hair... That argument is silly.\n\n>  i know my parents are really stressed about my cancer\n\nAnd the shaved head likely did them no favors in their coping... but OP.. you are NTA here. You're in an impossible situation.\n\nUnfortunately... This is unlikely to be the last time you'll be the bravest or most mature about what's going on.", "NTA. Hey, you are amazing for being this strong, it's not easy to have to come to terms with the fact that your body is trying to kill you, so hang on in there and take your happiness where you can find it. Live on your own terms. It's about you not them. But it would be nice to hug them and tell them you love them because they are terrified and fell helpless.", "NTA. Your parents suck. Considering your circumstances im surprised neither one of them wanted to help eleviate your symptoms, anyone can use trimmers and do a buzz cut. Props to your brother for helping you and being support.", "Oh sweetheart. Your last sentence breaks my heart. NTA X infinity and I'm so sorry you feel like you have to manage your parents' emotions around this on top of your own. That's not a fair burden for a 13yo to carry.", "Oh, sweetheart, I am so sorry you have to go through all this. Give your brother a hug and a cookie for me for being so supportive. \n\nAlso, very hard NTA, because it is your hair. Cancer or not, that should be your choice. On top of that, YOU are the one who is sick and YOU have to deal with the worst of the discomfort. Your parents are in a tough position too, yes, this is true. But if anyone is minimalising what is happening to you because they are stressed right now, over you cutting your hair, they need a firm headslap. You are thirteen, you have an awFul disease, you get to be emotional and go a little crazy. Besides, taking scissors to your hair because it was bugging you so much is hardly \"acting out\" under the circumstances. \n\nI hope your parents can be supportive, from this post I can't really tell. But so far I get the feeling they are making it more about them than you and expect you to accomodate their feelings. Who is accomodating yours? Your bro, yes, but he's a kid too, not your parent. And you need them right now. I don't understand why they wanted you to wait until the appointment, did they explain?", "NTA. I am very sorry this is happening to you. You shouldn't have to deal with the extra stress on top of this.", "NTA- And your brother sounds like an awesome brother. I don't understand why your parents were so adamant on you waiting when you were so upset and uncomfortable.", "Oh my god. You're the one with cancer, not them. AND YOU'RE THIRTEEN. What the actual fuck. Let me say this right off the bat, I'm so sorry you're having to go through all of this. You don't deserve it. None of it. You deserve to be happy and supported and to be surrounded by people who care. Your brother clearly adores you, so lean into that. And remember, even when the world looks like shit, you've got people in your corner.", "NTA. They think that by pretending you aren't experiencing the side effects of chemo that they can act like you don't really have cancer. \n\nToo bad for them. You put yourself and your health and your mental health first during this time period. I said a prayer for you, for what it's worth.", "NTA and what exactly were they expecting to happen at the hair appointment?!?! Did they think the hair stylist would magically make it so that your hair didn\u2019t fall out if they cut it in a cute pixie bob? You are under so much stress and this is one thing that you CAN control. This is about what you need and what makes you comfortable. I am so sorry about your diagnosis and wish you all the best for your treatment and recovery.", "NTA - it\u2019s your hair, your life and your cancer. You battle this however you need to. \n\nReally hope you beat this!", "NTA. This is mostly above our paygrade, but your parents suck and your brother respects you as a peer, as a human being. Your parents don't appreciate how hard this is on you, and it would be ridiculous to think that you understand their position. You're not \"acting out\" you're trying to exercise some sense of control for your body.\n\nI have never dealt with cancer personally, but I have people in my life who did, and they basically told me: The hair isn't falling out anymore, I took it away and it can't hurt me anymore. I am in control, not the cancer.\n\nThis was over the course of months of treatment, therapy and support. The goal was to show that you are stronger than the disease or illness that is trying to kill you.\n\nYou get that and your brother gets that. Your parents seem to think they can protect you from literal cancer. I get that they're upset too, but they aren't the ones with cancer, you are. If no one else is, I'm proud of you (and trust me, many of us are proud of you). You're not acting out, you're doing your best and that's all anyone will ever ask of you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your right to have your head shaved. And this situation is about YOU, not your parents. They should be comforting you, not the other way around. Best wishes for a good outcome for you.", "NTA. Its a buzzcut? Why did you need to get that done professionally? At least somewhere that books three weeks out, anyways, I'm sure a barber had availability. And tbh if you'd told your regular salon the situation I'm sure they would have squeezed you in, it's a buzzcut. Your parents didn't have to do it the way they did.", "NTA. It\u2019s *your* hair. Your parents aren\u2019t the ones who had to deal with how uncomfortable your hair was. It is perfectly fine for you, at 13, to have control over your own hair; cancer or not. It\u2019s not fair for them to expect you to wait weeks for something you\u2019ve already found a solution to on your own.", "Your parents are selfish it was traumatising you each time clumps fell out aswell as being uncomfortable. They could have booked in at any barbers or hairdressers it shouldn\u2019t have been a act of desperation because they chose there own feelings above yours. I\u2019m sorry you are ill and hope they can in the further be more accommodating and supportive xxx at least your brother sounds like a great support xx", "NTA. Also your brother is absolutely lovely. Truly a mensch. Very glad that he is there for you. \n\nYour parents seem to be channeling their pain and fear about your illness and the loss of control that comes with those fears into this thing (your hair) that they thought they could control. It's not an usual kind of reaction when people feel powerless, but it does not justify them fighting you on this. It was a dumb move on their part in the first place not to honor your wishes from the jump, although that part is a little easier to understand than the way they went off on you after the fact. That part is way out of line. They are the adults here and they are going to have to learn to cope with this situation without taking it out on you. Period. \n\nYou are right that your illness is hard for them, but it is not on you to do the work of making it easier for them. They should be making it easier for *you*. I hope very much that they come around soon and apologize for not taking your clearly expressed discomfort seriously and for flying off the handle after you and your brother took care of what needed to be done when they would not.", "These parents are hiding from their daughters ailment as far as id be concerned she could do whatever she wanted to be comfortable the parents deserve punishment", "You\u2019re NTA here. You\u2019re beginning something huge and life-changing, and doing what you need to do for your own sanity is an important skill. Especially when it comes to hair, which is THE most visible part of treatment.\n\nBut I want to say that your parents aren\u2019t assholes here either, really. I had cancer when I was 20, and now, after many years of remission and a new kid of my own, I have learned that my parents were just as scared and worried as I was. Maybe even more so sometimes.\n\nThe sudden and surprising nature of a diagnosis and then the rapid pace of getting surgeries and treatments underway are incredibly jarring. All of a sudden, your welfare is out of their hands. It feels like there\u2019s nothing they can do to protect you from the harm of all of this. Everything is uncertain.\n\nI suspect that your parents saw this hair appointment as kind of an anchor point. \u201cHere\u2019s a thing I CAN control. I can provide at least a bit of stability and support in this way, if no other.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think they were upset at you for doing it behind their backs, even though that\u2019s what they said at the time. It could be that they were upset because A) they realized that they screwed up not doing what you needed when you needed it, and B) they\u2019re now back to the anxiety and fear of not knowing exactly how to help and support you.\n\nI\u2019m not saying they were right. But my parents were crying themselves to sleep while I was in treatment. And I know now that I would be too. You\u2019re all going to learn how to navigate this as you go along.\n\nI hope all goes well for you and your family.", "NTA. They don't get to be more stressed about your cancer than you are stressed about your cancer. This is the same concept as circles of grief, the person with cancer is always the priority when it come to dealing with the consequences of that cancer.", "I've lost my hair my cancer treatment, twice.\n\n\nYour scalp HURTS! It itch's. The little hairs go EVERWHERE and down your clothes & in your bed. Only fix is shaving it.", "If I had an award, I'd give it to you. Hope OP sees this kind, beautiful message.", "A legit salon that may specialize in hair care or wigs for cancer patients do have considerable waiting lists. Getting a session to fit your skull for wigs alone is a serious task if you want something decent. Adding cancer on top of it, I think waiting 3 weeks is fine. \n\nThis isn't a \"simple\" hair appointment.", "because there was probably never a hair appointment to begin with. parents are likely denying reality, as is often the case of cancer patients this young.", "if they wanted to be there, then they could have shaved it themselves. I think its more about then wanting to deny the reality of the situation than anything else.", "Most towns and cities have at least a great clips or fantastic sams. Both of them are walk in \"salons\"", "The kiddo just wanted a buzz cut tho and wanted it asap. That is in fact simple. Not looking for a wig fitting at this point?", "Imagine coming to Am I The Asshole and actually believing this story is real.", "maybe because more than 84000 people worldwide are diagnosed a year.", "I think you're right. Mom scheduled an appointment for a \"short sassy new hairdo\" because it helps with the denial that OP has fucking cancer. What she either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand is that OP is past the stage where hanging onto any hair is a possibility.", "Well aren't you just a raging sack of sunshine?", "That's what I'm going with. They could have at least made the age somewhat believable. 13? Yeah, ok\ud83d\ude44\n(I know it's coming...\"Are you saying 13 year olds can't have cancer and a Reddit account?).", "Right.\n\nThe way they're talking about this as \"cutting your own hair\" shows that they are just not even processing the actual situation.", "Agreed. And I think *control* is the key word here. I'm sure they are frightened and feel powerless. But that is 100% not OP's problem. At least it shouldn't be.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right. It\u2019s definitely not. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem, her parents should get therapy and should apologize."]}
