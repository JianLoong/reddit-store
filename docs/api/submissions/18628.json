It\u2019s ok they asked and it\u2019s ok if you say no thank you", "NTA.

I would keep it. It has sentimental value to you. People need to stop guilt tripping people. It\u2019s yours and you can say no. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a spoon. It it means something to you, keep and stop worrying about being a people pleaser", "NTA. you aren't obligated to give ANYONE your property just because they want it, and you have more sentimental attachment to that specific object than he does. IF you don't give it to him, the great grandfather is no worse off. He just wants it to post on social media about it when he gives it to his Great grandfather", "Absolutely positively NTA.

You\u2019re under absolute no obligation to part with something that is yours, regardless of its history! And if your friends allows something like this to get in the way of a life long friendship, she was never truly your friend!", "NAH, enjoy your gift from grandma. It is just how it is.

You're allowed to keep it if you feel attached to it.  Likewise they're allowed to be interested in it due to their own family connection to the place and express that interest... yes, admittedly, this was a bit crass of them, but it seems like a level of crassness that you can allow based on the pre-existing friendship, and it seemed like they were willing to make you an offer of money or some other valuable good/service in exchange.\n\nThis kinda seems like the pressure to hand this over is mostly coming from within yourself.  Are they nagging you?", "NTA. It was a gift from your grandmother and has memories of your good times together that you will cherish forever. That trumps someone else\u2019s claim of a historical connection.", "NTA.\n\nI was almost at the N A H... but what makes the friend a slight AH, is the fact he just asked you to give him the item. Not even asking if you're willing to sell it, or how much for it.\n\nBecause that's a much easier way to decline. \"Hey... would you be willing to sell the ashtray?\" \"Ohh sorry, It's not for sale.\" Is a much less awkward interaction them\n\n\"Hey... would can I have this?\" \"Ohh sorry, no.

I had been given a fantastic mug that had illustrations of many of the most important subs on it.  My aunt asked me to give it to her husband, which I did.  I regret it every time I think about it.
