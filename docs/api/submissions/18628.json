It\u2019s ok they asked and it\u2019s ok if you say no thank you", "NTA.  When something belongs to you then you are under no obligation to gift it to someone else.  \n\nIt doesn't even matter that it has sentimental value to someone else, it's yours and you are allowed to keep it if you want to keep it.", "NTA.  I would keep it. It has sentimental value to you. People need to stop guilt tripping people. It\u2019s yours and you can say no. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a spoon. It it means something to you, keep and stop worrying about being a people pleaser", "NTA. you aren't obligated to give ANYONE your property just because they want it, and you have more sentimental attachment to that specific object than he does. IF you don't give it to him, the great grandfather is no worse off. He just wants it to post on social media about it when he gives it to his Great grandfather", "Absolutely positively NTA. Him asking for it is one thing but him pushing for you to give it to him is another; and it\u2019s crossing a line. You\u2019re under absolute no obligation to part with something that is yours, regardless of its history! And if your friends allows something like this to get in the way of a life long friendship, she was never truly your friend!", "NAH, enjoy your gift from grandma. It is just how it is. The great grandfather have lived his life and enjoyed the times he had at the bar, which no one can take away. Ashtray is yours and brings joy to you now. World is dynamic, nostalgia can be nice, but we must except change.", "NTA. \n\nGift it of you genuinely want to give it away, not because you feel obligated to. That's the nature of a gift.", "NAH\n\nYou don't have to give it to them. \n\nThey aren't being ridiculous to ask for it given the circumstances.  \n\nIt seems absolutely bonkers to care about the specific ownership dates and when an ashtray was used.  It's clearly an item that would mean a lot to this specific family even if it wasn't sitting on the bar the very moment grandpa owned the place. \n\nIf I were you I'd take grandma out and find something new from your town to remember and hand over the ashtray.
