He can rebook once he comes up with his half if he wants to go. Also, idk your living situation but please stop paying for this man. Two years is plenty of time to find a job to support himself and I guarantee part of the reason he won\u2019t get a job is because he knows other people will foot the bill.", "NTA at all. If he's been \"looking\" for a job for 2 years he literally is just not actually trying to get a job. He expects that you'll pay for the trip in order to not be rude, but he is actually being extremely rude and disrespectful to you. I'd absolutely cancel. You don't want to go, it's extremely unlikely he's going to pay for it, even if he does get a job. Getting a paycheck doesn't mean he's going to share any of that money with you, even if he claims he'll pay you the half. If his sister wants him to go so badly, she can pay for it.", "You're making a reasonable request (you do whatever you want with your money, you don't owe him a 8k+ trip ) and if he can't pay his share then he shouldn't go, he is an adult and he needs to lean that if to travel he has to work and get money himself. You've been sustaining him for 2years already, maybe it'll be an eye-opener. NTA", "NTA\n\nThat's a lot of money. Even if he is able to provide half of the amount, it's a big favor from your side to spend so much money on a trip that you don't want to make.\n\nHas he ever provided a substantial part of your budget or have you provided most of the time? An expensive trip is quite much to ask for when you were the main provider for two years now. Definitely NTA.", "Fake. How could anyone in that financial position even think about going to 8000 usd holiday?", "NTA. I have my suspicions about how hard he has been looking for a job.\n\nRegardless, it's unfair of him to expect you to shoulder so much of the cost. Especially considering you had to be coerced into agreeing to go in the first place.\n\nYou explained the situation to him clearly early on. You gave him ample opportunity.", "NTA\n\nYou told him early on, and there\u2019s lower level jobs to help out even if they aren\u2019t dream careers. It\u2019s ridiculous to want you to pay for the whole holiday, or even more than half of it, it should be split even or not at all.", "NTA.  You are not obliged to finance almost the whole trip and you were clear that you won't. And why is he lending money to friends when he has no income?", "NTA. It sounds like he hasn't any intention of paying his share, just expects you to do it all.\n\nI did just have a thought: don't cancel the trip, forget about him, and go celebrate his sister's birthday with her instead. Any money that should have come from your boyfriend could go towards the cost.", "Not working for 2 years is impossible. There are so many businesses looking for employees. Your boyfriend sounds super lazy and has definitely been taking advantage of the situation. \n\nStop being a doormat and cancel the trip. He will never come up with the money, and you're kidding yourself to think otherwise. \n\nNTA", "NTA his sister can pay for him to go", "NTA he is a mooch. 2 years and can't find a job is complete nonsense.", "ESH.\n\nSomeone pressuring their brother and his partner into an expensive holiday, knowing the brother is unemployed and broke, is a shit thing to do. If she so desperately wants people to join her, she can help with their expenses, especially for close family financially struggling.\n\nA lot of people go through the graduation unemployment cycle of needing experience to get experience. I don't blame people who get sucked into it, and it's entirely likely your boyfriend really is trying his best and just getting screwed by the entitled jackasses that do interviews now. But if that is the case, he should be completely fine with you deciding where **your** money goes. This isn't a need, it's a want, and if money is tight, holidays are usually the first thing to go.\n\nThen again, it sounds like you're being a bit draconic in your dealings. \"Get the money or else\" has you sounding more like a loan shark than a supportive partner. Imagine how bad he's going to feel when/if he can't get the money together? That will be because **you** set him up for failure. I understand the pragmatism of putting the ball in his court, but I don't think you've really thought through just how much pressure and self-worth issues you're adding to his already stressful financial situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know why you agreed in the first place knowing he has no money.", "NTA - and in fact even if he paid half, you'd still be doing him a favour joining him on an expensive trip you aren't that interested in going anyway.", "NTA. Two plus years into the relationship. Paying for everything. If he can find the money to go on vacation. But can't find the money to pay to live. Rethink the future. A job would beat no job. His perfect job in his field may not come.", "YWNTA for cancelling. Do NOT plan a trip with people who can\u2019t afford it.
