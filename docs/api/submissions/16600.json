He can rebook once he comes up with his half if he wants to go. Also, idk your living situation but please stop paying for this man. Two years is plenty of time to find a job to support himself and I guarantee part of the reason he won\u2019t get a job is because he knows other people will foot the bill.", "NTA at all. If he's been \"looking\" for a job for 2 years he literally is just not actually trying to get a job. He expects that you'll pay for the trip in order to not be rude, but he is actually being extremely rude and disrespectful to you. I'd absolutely cancel. You don't want to go, it's extremely unlikely he's going to pay for it, even if he does get a job. Getting a paycheck doesn't mean he's going to share any of that money with you, even if he claims he'll pay you the half. If his sister wants him to go so badly, she can pay for it.", "You're making a reasonable request (you do whatever you want with your money, you don't owe him a 8k+ trip ) and if he can't pay his share then he shouldn't go, he is an adult and he needs to lean that if to travel he has to work and get money himself. You've been sustaining him for 2years already, maybe it'll be an eye-opener. NTA", "NTA\n\nThat's a lot of money. Even if he is able to provide half of the amount, it's a big favor from your side to spend so much money on a trip that you don't want to make.\n\nHas he ever provided a substantial part of your budget or have you provided most of the time? An expensive trip is quite much to ask for when you were the main provider for two years now. Definitely NTA.", "Fake. How could anyone in that financial position even think about going to 8000 usd holiday?", "NTA. I have my suspicions about how hard he has been looking for a job.\n\nRegardless, it's unfair of him to expect you to shoulder so much of the cost. Especially considering you had to be coerced into agreeing to go in the first place.\n\nYou explained the situation to him clearly early on. You gave him ample opportunity.", "NTA\n\nYou told him early on, and there\u2019s lower level jobs to help out even if they aren\u2019t dream careers. It\u2019s ridiculous to want you to pay for the whole holiday, or even more than half of it, it should be split even or not at all.", "NTA.  You are not obliged to finance almost the whole trip and you were clear that you won't. And why is he lending money to friends when he has no income?", "NTA. It sounds like he hasn't any intention of paying his share, just expects you to do it all.\n\nI did just have a thought: don't cancel the trip, forget about him, and go celebrate his sister's birthday with her instead. Any money that should have come from your boyfriend could go towards the cost.", "Not working for 2 years is impossible. There are so many businesses looking for employees. Your boyfriend sounds super lazy and has definitely been taking advantage of the situation. \n\nStop being a doormat and cancel the trip. He will never come up with the money, and you're kidding yourself to think otherwise. \n\nNTA", "NTA his sister can pay for him to go", "NTA he is a mooch. 2 years and can't find a job is complete nonsense.", "ESH.\n\nSomeone pressuring their brother and his partner into an expensive holiday, knowing the brother is unemployed and broke, is a shit thing to do. If she so desperately wants people to join her, she can help with their expenses, especially for close family financially struggling.\n\nA lot of people go through the graduation unemployment cycle of needing experience to get experience. I don't blame people who get sucked into it, and it's entirely likely your boyfriend really is trying his best and just getting screwed by the entitled jackasses that do interviews now. But if that is the case, he should be completely fine with you deciding where **your** money goes. This isn't a need, it's a want, and if money is tight, holidays are usually the first thing to go.\n\nThen again, it sounds like you're being a bit draconic in your dealings. \"Get the money or else\" has you sounding more like a loan shark than a supportive partner. Imagine how bad he's going to feel when/if he can't get the money together? That will be because **you** set him up for failure. I understand the pragmatism of putting the ball in his court, but I don't think you've really thought through just how much pressure and self-worth issues you're adding to his already stressful financial situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know why you agreed in the first place knowing he has no money.", "NTA - and in fact even if he paid half, you'd still be doing him a favour joining him on an expensive trip you aren't that interested in going anyway.", "NTA. Two plus years into the relationship. Paying for everything. If he can find the money to go on vacation. But can't find the money to pay to live. Rethink the future. A job would beat no job. His perfect job in his field may not come.", "YWNTA for cancelling. Do NOT plan a trip with people who can\u2019t afford it. If you willingly pay for it then that\u2019s something else but you agreed to split it and warned him.", "You\u2019d be surprised. This guy sounds like my ex tbh", "You would be surprised, lots of people pay huge amounts for holidays when they are just scraping by. It is illogical but still seems to be a thing.", "Just break up with him. You literally have posted previously that you want to break up with him but you don't want to be alone. Why would you want to even think about spending thousands of dollars to go on a vacation you don't want to do with a man you don't want to be with?\n\nNTA for not wanting to pay, but you're being an asshole to yourself for staying in this relationship when you're unhappy and unfulfilled.", "NTA. At the six month to a year mark is when you stop looking in your field & start looking for anything. And you OP shouldn\u2019t be supporting him. He\u2019s an adult & he needs to earn his own way not depend on you. Plus vacations are for the employed not the mooching of their SO.", "NTA at all, you made it clear from the start that he had to pay his own way. If he can't pay he can't go, that's how life works.", "NTA as my good friend would say if he can say \u201cwould you like fries with that\u201d he could get a job. He\u2019s choosing not too because he\u2019s not really that motivated to get a job. He has no need too. Your paying for his lifestyle. \nSo I would say cancel the trip because you simply can\u2019t afford it. His family knows he\u2019s not working how do they think he\u2019s paying for it or are they happy with you paying for everything too??\nNot only cancel the trip but make some serious changes in your relationship because right now this is a very uneven partnership", "NTA. Cancel it right now. He's taking advantage of you.", "NTA on the trip issue, even if he gets a job, he will not get the time off.  Coddling and supporting him for two years of his not finding any kind of work is being a naive AH, he is just using you. Set a deadline for life, get a job and pay half the bills or move back in with mommy and daddy.", "Remind him now and often of the deadline so it's no surprise.  Also let his sister know. You don't want either claiming they were blindsided.\n\nEdit- NTA. if course. Geez, you were generous to give him this much time.", "Nta.\nYour posts history shows that you are not happy in this relationship. That is true, because your boyfriend is a mooch. At this stage, he is not even trying to get a job.", "NTA he has not gotten a job for 2 years sounds to me like he knew you were going to support him. Although I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s graduated from but I can assure you there are many jobs he can take that pays. Any retail or restaurant job. If it\u2019s a case he graduated from college it might be an ego thing where he feels like he can\u2019t work a customer service job since he has a degree.", "NTA. You shouldn't pay 8k for a trip you didn't even want to go on. Invest that money on something that would benefit you more than a vacation.", "NTA.\n\nCancel the holiday.  $8k is a lot of money, especially for a trip you don't want to take.  If he can come up with his portion, he can go, but only after he's paid his share of bills, back rent, etc.\n\nJob hunting is difficult but at some point a person needs to swallow their pride and grab what's available.  Businesses generally look more favorably on someone who's working \"a garbage job\" (non-prestigious jobs like fast food) than someone who hasn't worked at all.  \n\nYou're paying for everything right now.  Is he at least doing most if not all the chores?  If not, you might want to revisit the relationship.  (Stay At Home Peeps are fine if they're contributing via labor.  If you pay for everything and do everything, that's not a healthy relationship.)", "NTA. And... Honestly? Two years of not working is INSANE. Degree or not, get a fucking soul-sucking retail job until you find your career. How long have you been together? Is this man even worth it?", "NTA, but I think you shot yourself in the foot by making these plans and knowing your boyfriend has no money.  Why start another conflict over money?", "NTA. Guy sounds more like a moocher than bf. Did you know there are actually men out here who work and pay their own way in life?", "NTA Give him the money he gave you back for a deposit on his new place. If you want to be nice, you can help him pack.", "NTA", "THIS!  Two years!!!!!  Ugh", "So many people get into so many horrible mistakes because of fear of loneliness. I'm autistic and always wanted to live on a deserted island, (I struggle in my 8 year relationship because I often just want to be alone) so I definitely don't understand, but I can tell you that I've known so many people in life who were hurt. And this man has no respect for OP. I'm not blaming OP, but I will just tell you from 44 years of experience that he will cheat whenever he gets a chance and otherwise use you in every way possible, because of this. You HAVE TO stand up for yourself, but you also have to get rid of him, because it's too late.\n\nOP? Dump the dead weight, cash in your vacation and pay for a real one for yourself. Enjoy it and being single, keeping in mind that this is time to value being alone, because your next relationship could be your last.", "\"But I want experiences!\"\n\nCool - how about getting the experience of working and supporting yourself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm all for doing some things when you're young instead of saving every last penny for retirement (not everyone is healthy enough to travel at 70) but some people believe they should do everything now and not worry about retirement.", "The entitlement never ends. But this guy will never respect her, because she doesn't respect herself. She needs to stop with the ultimatums and get rid of the dead weight, already.", "And for $8000, I'd be expecting a luxury 5 star hotel in the Maldives or a suite on a cruise ship, not Las Vegas.", ">Then again, it sounds like you're being a bit draconic in your dealings. \"Get the money or else\"\n\n\nYou mean the person who has been paying everything for 2 years, struggling with paying up $8000 is a bit draconic? \nCare to help her with the half so she relaxes?"]}
