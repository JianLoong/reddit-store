Thats not a lease they have with you, so you arent responsible for their rent.\n\nSecondly: If your sister was there, she could have babysat the kids, but instead she is an irresponsible witch, who they couldnt count on, so thats not your responsibility either.\n\nLastly: A live in Nanny for 2 weeks would have been far more than they could afford and they need to count their lucky stars that you were not only willing, but able (time wise) to take on the responsibility of taking care of their kids. \n\nThe FIRST words out of their mouths SHOULD have been: Oh my gosh!
