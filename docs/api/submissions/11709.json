A super basic tiny apartment costs well over double my mortgage for a 3 bedroom two bath three story house. You can get a two bedroom apartment in my area for $750 a month.  There's a whole house up for rent right now with two bedrooms and 1.5 bathrooms for $1100 just down the road.  It's a tiny house but still.  The cost of living in some areas is just insane.  Sure you won't make as much money around here but the cost of living being lower helps equal that out.  \n\nThere's been a recent influx of people leaving areas with crazy high housing costs.  My new neighbor left a very high paying job in a larger city just to get away from the stress.  He bought a house for $100k that would have run him 500-600k (or even up to a million) and believe it or not it's a really nice house on a nice street.  He told me he's going to still be able to put away about 70% of what he was saving before for retirement even though he's making half as much. \n\n>  Average Standard of Living\nThe average weekly expenditure in Australia is around $2,200 per household. This estimate includes home loans or rent at an average $600 a week, followed by food and eating out at $400, and insurance and other financial services at $200. Utility bills have risen steadily since 2006. (For a small 85 square meter apartment the monthly utilities of water, electricity, and gas cost around $220 per month. For a telephone, TV, and Internet package allow around $70 per month.) These numbers mean it costs an average household around $100,000 per year to live in Australia.\n\nWTF!  How is that even possible?", "What\u2019s the difference between paying $450 a week and $1800 a month?\n\nedit: Other than paying weekly ends up costing you more money over the course of the year", "El mito es real", "The amount of fatal bear attacks in the US is double the amount of deaths by snake bite in Australia.

I'm in the UK and we have nothing really that wants to kill us where I live but I was watching a property program yesterday, they had a big pond behind their garden with no railing or fence and the dad was like yeh our 5 and 7 year old love fishing in there. Then mum adds there's an alligator living in there at the moment too. We love all the wildlife here... so nuts to me! I'm nice and happy with my safe environment compared to Oz and the US thank you very much.", "Not all of us Aussies! \nAnd you guys deal with bears and mountain lions and all sorts of things too", "Lol, it's all about what you're used to. I'm from central Europe and moved to Canada 14 years ago. When I tell my German friends about the bears that walked through the campground, or the cougar sighting on a hiking trail, they almost have a heart attack.", "Come on, you've been to Iguazu haven't you?\n\nI have to admit I haven't been back swimming in the Parana River when I visit my friends in Resistencia since I found out there are piranhas in the river.

I fly back there this Sunday..", "I was sunbaking in my parents backyard near the pool when I was younger and all of a sudden heard the leaves rustling on the pavers. Was a red bellied black snake enjoying the sun with me, I just stayed there til it slithered away..  at least it wasn't an eastern brown they are the 2nd most venemous in thecworld.", "Exactly. I was out at my local wildlife refuge many years ago & got down on the ground to photograph some flowers. When I was getting up, I almost put my hand on a pygmy rattlesnake sunning itself. I was like, \"OOPS better watch where you're putting your hands.\" I took pictures of the snake but don't know where they're at. That was back when I was still shooting film.", "We accept this.", "No, my mom went to Iguazu and invited me and I told her \"no thanks mom enjoy your trip\" and she came with amazing videos from the waterfalls and told me \"I can take you next year!\" and I'm still saying no lol. I've been to many provinces: Salta, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Mendoza, Rio Negro, C\u00f3rdoba, San Luis... just not Misiones, I'm irrationally terrified of jumping spiders! My mom did say that she didn't see spiders at all but in my mind I'm like \"just because you can't see them doesn't mean they aren't there, hiding in the dark\".  \nWhat changed in Buenos Aires in 8 years? I'm not sure, a lot of things but I guess the changes were gradual. The most useful for me is that now Google Maps actually gives you the correct time at which public transport will arrive (bus) and urban trains work a lot better than they used to, and I mean, like 200% improvement if you have to put a number. Transit in general is a lot better than it used to be, with the creation of many Metrobus lines (it's actually just an area of the street that is reserved only for buses and ambulances, normal cars can't go there). Oh and if you plan to rent a car when you come here, you can't use the car in ANY part of the downtown area (el centro) because pretty much ALL streets were made for pedestrians. And they look really nice, many with a lot of plants. Calle Corrientes is gorgeous now. And please go to Cadore, the ice cream shop, there's always a line but totally worth it. Corrientes Avenue 1695 :)", "Am Aussie- have seen a few snakes in the wild but never had to deal with a snake. They are not around as much as our reputation suggest. I blame Steve Irwin. \n\nBear s in the US scare me way more.", "Can confirm!", "Oh thanks for the info.  I don't plan to rent a car in BA, not brave enough to drive there, I usually walk, pretty much walk anywhere between Recoletta & Puerto Madero, now I'm really looking forward to exploring again.  Am also dreaming of dulce de leche ice cream! I am hiring a car when I get to Jujuy as my friend is getting married in Purmamarca.\n\nI've been up to Iguazu twice, never seen a spider when I was there, so I think you would be safe. \ud83d\ude0a  But fears are hard to overcome sometimes, so I understand.", "Thank you for the laugh.
