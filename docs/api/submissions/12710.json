We live together in a small two bedroom apartment whilst we both attend the same college.

Nicole and I know each other pretty well and have spent a lot of time together. We haven't always gotten along (which siblings have?) but we do consider each other sisters.\n\nAnyway, onto the story.\n\nSo me and Nicole both got sick of dorms and moved in together around two months ago.\n\nBack at home, Nicole never cooked for herself (not beyond microwave meals, anyway) and now that we're both supposed to be living independently, she's started cooking.\n\nNicole keeps \"forgetting\" to turn off the stove or oven when she's finished with them. At one point, this nearly caused a full-blown house fire when she forgot about the stove whilst a paper plate of hers had been left on top of it. \n\nI kept gently reminding Nicole to turn off the oven/stove when she's done with them but she just doesn't seem to listen. I even tried putting sticky notes around the kitchen to try to remind her.\n\nEventually, Nicole got irritated with the reminders and told me I'm treating her like a child. I said I'm sorry if it came off that way but she needs to remember.\n\nThe problem has just kept persisting and a near miss with a house fire happened again when Nicole forgot about the stove, and she didn't hear the smoke detector because she was blasting music on her airpods. Luckily I noticed it and was able to put it out.\n\nI tried to have a talk with Nicole and told her this needs to stop. Nicole just got mad before I could even suggest anything and told me to get off her case. She said I'm overreacting and that she \"can handle it\". She refused to listen to anything I had to say and kept talking over me.\n\nThis has started to make me really anxious, especially when Nicole is home whilst I'm out.\n\nI bought some plastic child locks for the knobs that control the stove and oven, and I placed them on there. I know Nicole can't open child-proof stuff.\n\nThis way, she can't use the stove or oven when I'm out of the home. When I'm home, I can make sure nothing bad happens. Me and Nicole have similar class schedules so this shouldn't inconvenience her too much.\n\nNicole went apeshit when she noticed them, and started screaming at me and told me I'm a control freak and bullying her.  I yelled back at her and told her I wouldn't be doing it if she could act like a responsible adult. Nicole called me a bitch and said I have no business controlling when she gets to cook.\n\nShe's now gone to a friend's place and has blocked my phone number. My dad and stepmother got concerned after getting texts off Nicole and they keep messaging me about it, telling me I need to get Nicole to come back.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679263364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vza1h/aita_for_putting_childproof_locks_on_the_stove_to/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're NTA in the slightest. Left unchecked your stepsis is seriously fixing to burn the place down and seriously doesn't seem to be bothered by that fact. Not cool at all.", "NTA\n\nYou are treating her like a child- because she's acting as irresponsible as one. \n\nThis isn't a little issue like leaving lights on or forgetting some house rule like keeping the bathroom door closed \n\nThis is a literal safety issue. You can burn down a house. \n\nShe's too irresponsible to be using a stove \n\nIf she wants to be treated like a normal adult who's free to cook whenever she wants- then she needs to get her shit together and do it without nearly killing everyone in the house and burning it down", "NTA. Nicole is an idiot and has proven herself unable to be trusted to use a stove on her own. What does she expect you to do? Ignore it to save her ego while she burns your place down?? Personally, I would have kicked her out and found another roommate rather than putting safety locks on the stove. But either way, the main concern is avoiding your place being burned down and you took the necessary measures.", "NTA\n\nShe nearly burnt down the house twice. Thats two times too many, espcecially when something as simple as turning  off the stove is involved", "NTA if she insists on acting like a child then she gets treated like on ( she\u2019s is a danger to herself and other people how is she ever going to live on her own )", "Two times she almost burns down the house, one time where she didn't hear the smoke detectors, and she wonders why you're this nervous with her using the stove?\n\nNTA, and she needs to either put more effort into remembering or get used to lots of peanut butter and jelly.", "NTA. Call me overdramatic, but I rather have an angry sister than losing my life or home.", "NTA. This is a tough situation as you are doing something that seems wildly condescending without context. But you can\u2019t just let someone burn the damn place down and she has a pretty serious track record. If your/her parents give you any flack, tell them they should have raised her well enough to know how to turn the stove off. That\u2019s some really bad parenting right there. In the longer term though you may need to get a different roommate.", "Wait. You bought child locks to stop a twenty year old woman *and it worked*? I\u2019m blown away. She\u2019s twenty and can\u2019t open a child lock?? That\u2019s wild. \n\nNTA\n\nIf she wanted to not be treated like a child, she needs to not act like a child. Habitually leaving the stove on and starting multiple house fires is dangerous and honestly most children know better than that. She\u2019s a danger to herself, you, your house, and all of your belongings.\n\nTell your dad and stepmom that you are not going to sit back and just allow her to burn your house down. What if you were asleep and hadn\u2019t heard the alarm until it was too late? She could have died or been injured, *you* could have died or been injured. \n\nMy dad was a firefighter and I\u2019ve seen first hand the damage stove/oven fires can do. House fires are *dangerous* and to have someone with such disregard for safety living with you is *dangerous.*\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think child locks is enough. You need to move out. At some point she will figure out how to get them off or do something else equally dangerous (metal in the microwave? the toaster?) and you will pay the price. It is not worth living together if she is going to put your life in danger constantly. \n\nMove out. If you can\u2019t right now then you need to get insurance and be on alert at all times. Buy a fire blanket and make sure your fire extinguisher is within its expiry date and you know how it works. Hell, buy multiple fire extinguishers.", "NTA.  You do not mess with fire, she already had two close calls, you may not catch the third.  I would prefer she get mad at you rather than you lose your entire life to a fire she caused.  She can move out and burn down her own home.  If she can't understand why the stove is a serious matter, she doesn't et the privilege of using one.", "NTA  \nshe literally started multiple fires and put both herself, you, and your neighbors safety in danger. if she cant be responsible enough to turn off the stove then she shouldn't be using it. your the one taking responsibility and trying to protect her from herself.", "NTA she nearly Burnt the apartment down twice and doesn\u2019t even seem fazed", "I think when it comes down to it. It's a safety issue. So if she can't figure it out then yeah . Treat her like a child. I'd rather be alive and have someone pissed off at me than being dead.and it's not a one off.", "Nta. If that apt burned down and the building with it you\u2019d be liable for the damages and be in a horrendous debt.", "NTA \n\nHer actions are dangerous and actually threatening your property and your life. \n\nShe needs to see a psychiatrist to see about getting ADHD meds. It sounds like that's what she has but I'm just some asshole on the internet", "NTA.  Is it electric or gas?  If she can't defeat basic childproofing I expect that locating and flipping the breaker for an electric range is outside of her skillset.  Good luck and loop your parents in on what's going on.", "NTA.  If she can\u2019t figure out how to work child proof locks, then she shouldn\u2019t be using the oven.  If it\u2019s because of a disability, that would be different, but if it\u2019s because of simple, IRL weaponized incompetence?  Go for it.", "NTA\n\nI hope like hell you have renters insurance. If she damages the building the owner\u2019s insurer WILL sue you for their costs.", "NTA. She needs to get her shit together. She could kl you.", "NTA and ffs she needs to grow up!! I get forgetting things in the kitchen (I used to leave the cabinets open all the time), but once someone talks to you about it ONCE it should be something you work on. Causing 2 fires is ridiculous. It seems like for some reason she\u2019s doing it on purpose, because why else would she ignore the sticky notes and KEEP doing it???", "NTA, she\u2019s acting like a child so it makes sense to \u201ctreat her as one\u201d", "I am waffling between NTA and ESH.\n\nYour stepsis is irresponsible. She could literally leave you homeless or worse, dead.\n\nChild-proofing the stove is an asshole move. It is. But you have tried to talking to her and yet she is still continuing her irresponsible ways. So I can understand it.\n\nBut honestly, I think you should find a new roommate.
