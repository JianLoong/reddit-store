At some point she will figure out how to get them off or do something else equally dangerous (metal in the microwave? the toaster?) and you will pay the price. It is not worth living together if she is going to put your life in danger constantly. \n\nMove out. If you can\u2019t right now then you need to get insurance and be on alert at all times.

I was terrified all the time around a house fire or burglary to the extent I didn\u2019t go to bed until I was certain she was in and done for the night. \n\nYou need to find somewhere else to live. Nicole is negligent to the point of real danger. You are not the AH here.", "NTA I have SPD and I am a horror for leaving the oven and hob turned on. I bought a hob that turns itself off once the pan is removed and I never ever leave anything on the top of it. Same with the oven. My hubby is the one that stacks the dishwasher, so the first thing he does is check the oven is off. Your sister is not just forgetting, she is not doing anything to acknowledge that she is forgetting, or putting together a routine to help mitigate it. She is in fact being extremely negligent by actually placing combustibles on it. For these two reasons I would refuse to live with her, she won't accept there is an issue and placing paper plates on top is crazy.", "Ask your dad why he doesn\u2019t care that she almost burned the house down several times and could\u2019ve killed you. She acts like a child then gets treated like one. Don\u2019t apologize. Tell him you did what you had to do to protect yourself and your stuff. You can\u2019t afford to lose everything because she doesn\u2019t care to be safe.", "You're NTA, you're not a control freak or a bully, you're trying to not have the house burn down around you. You'll be safer in your own place without that menace", "NTA\n\n\"concerned after getting texts off Nicole and they keep messaging me about it, telling me I need to get Nicole to come back\"  - so they think you are her carer?\n\nIt sounds like you and Nicole could argue with the landlord that SHE has broken the lease.  Explain the situation and end this arrangement.  The landlord doesn't want a dangerous tenant either.  Let Nicole find people who think the same as her or move back with the parents who clearly have been stopping her from killing herself and others for years.\n\nI lived with somebody who kept doing this and they were always drunk.  Perhaps her brain hasn't fully formed but I was using the oven without supervision aged 10.  Has her mother babied her?", "Get your own place or go back to the dorm.", "Skill issue lmao", "I baby proofed all my outlets.  My 1 1/2 year old would take out the baby proofing covers and put them back in.  Once I took them out he stopped playing with the outlets.", "NTA - My 18 month old lasted 20 min when we \u201cbaby proofed\u201d. At least it slowed them down a few minutes which gave us a chance to get to them. If your parents and sister can\u2019t see what a hazard this is and how risky the situation is, there\u2019s a problem. \nWhen you get a scare about something like this, you make sure you don\u2019t do it again. You triple check your triple checks if you need to. I get the feeling stepsister has not faced consequences for her actions before.", "Or simpler/cheaper solution for the stove top, get an induction plate (I think this is fairly safe, would double check with the model first) and she's stuck using that instead of the stove until she can be more responsible. It also makes noise so OP would be likely to notice it. Keeping an oven on a long time isn't the safest thing to do, but it's not as dangerous as the stovetop.", "I once lived in a house where the stove knobs were pulled off when not in use because my baby sister (ie. under 1 year) would climb onto the stove any chance she got. It totally tariffed my mom the first time she got up there.", "All the friend has to do is wait till she wants to start cooking. Then the friend will understand perfectly well.", "Not sure this would help.. I set fire to ramen noodles in the microwave once\ud83d\ude05 I was like, 13, and forgot to add water before putting them in", "It could be a motor skills issue. I know some adults who can\u2019t open child proof locks for that reason.", "My mom has been using the same style of baby gate since my sister was a baby. Can't figure out how the mechanism works. Baby niece has only been alive a little more than a year and she's figured out how to hulk it open to get where she wants!", "My brother had to put latches at the top of the doors and get specialty locks for their windows because my nephew figures locks out in 2 minutes or less, and at the top of the doors was the only height he couldn't reach at the time. He loved going to the park at midnight. Lol", "I have ADHD. I've forgotten the stove once in the old apartment, and melted a Tupperware onto a stove cover once (or..more than once...) But I've never started a fucking house fire!", "I have ADHD and can confirm my husband has had to turn the oven off for me a few times. Never the stove, though. Jesus.", "I have ADHD, it doesn't make one unable to figure out childproof locks. I've also never had trouble remembering to tirn off appliances but I know many people with ADHD struggle with that.", "My son has ADHD and he actually had the same problem with the stove. I put a sign over that says\"turn off the f***ing stove\" and it worked! Before anyone jumps on me about the language, this wasn't until he was 18-19 and because it made him laugh so hard the first time he saw it, it triggered something in him that made him remember. No fire and he cooks sometimes, win win! \nNTA", "If cats had opposable thumbs, they would take over the world.", "I have ADHD and autism and have definitely forgotten to turn the stove off when I'm really tired or stressed and struggling with what's in my brain. But I'm super apologetic when it happens. I basically destroyed my housemates housemates pan on a stove that was thankfully electric and I apologised and bought him another pan.", "My bf has ADHD and he forgets to turn off the oven about once a month on average. I do not have ADHD and even I forget about once a year on average.", "I understand your point, but this particular situation goes far beyond anything that can be explained by being a bad person or not caring. I think repeatedly putting yourself in that much danger is pathological by definition. Could be a variety of other things besides ADHD though", "Jeeez that\u2019s a strong kid! I\u2019m happy mine stopped short of doing that, but he did unscrew the bolts once until I taped them down. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised, your dog was probably jealous someone was \u201cgoing walkies\u201d and they weren\u2019t. \nEvery dog I\u2019ve ever had would be in dismay if they weren\u2019t also put on the leash when one of their siblings was going out for a pee.", "I have ADHD, and child locks are more of a physical challenge than a mental one (arthritis). I've also wrecked a couple Tupperware on the stove and made some big ass messes, but I've never started a fire or forgotten a burner. I'm a very competent cook! I'm fucking terrible with laundry tho. My stuff has been on the clothesline for two days.", "Autistic with ADHD here:\n\nI\u2019m old, so I was actually a child in preschool when \u201cchild proof\u201d stuff started to be a thing. \n\nMy mother always handed me all the \u201cchildproof\u201d stuff to open.  It was never any hindrance.", "Not sure if I am the 100th person to tell you this, but look into silicone spatulas - you can leave them in the pan and they don\u2019t melt! They might discolour a bit over time, though", "I have ADHD and I've left the hob on too often. But if someone put child locks on there I promise you, if I couldn't already remove them it'd become my hyperfixation to figure it out and nothing could drag me away until I'd done so.\n\nADHD could be involved, but this sounds like a different issue.\n\nNTA, OP", "I have adhd as well and while I'm okay with everything else the stove is an issue, it happened three times so far and now I have developed ocd tendencies and I have to check the stove every night before bed and every time I leave the house and double or triple check if I leave the house for longer.\n\nAlso I have to make sure I have safety nets in place to keep myself from messing up, i never burn a candle that's not in a glass, checking the stove every time I leave etc. It's just my responsibility", "Or straight-up incompetence.", "Hmm, ADHD doesn't cause inability to defeat childproofing. Also, most people with ADHD don't leave the stove on over and over, they figure out a system to help them remember.", "Yeah, I don't think stepsis has ADHD, or if she does she has ADHD and also something else going on. I have childproof locks all over my house because my cats are evil geniuses, and they only work because cats don't have the thumbs to operate them, but I've caught them pawing at the locks. Like, they clearly know what is up. My CATS. But this twenty-year-old human can't figure it out.", ">Actually, there's an acronym that defines what is required to engage an ADHD brain, ICNU. Interest, Challenge, Novelty, and Urgency. Putting a kiddy lock on something might just kickstart and ADHD brain into high gear. I know I couldn't walk away once I saw that padlock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyup! Totally and completely my ADHD brain going \"ok time to leave for work......ooohh! I child proof lock! A challenge! Go!\" I could probably pick it in seconds but if it took me all day I would sit there until I got it.  Someone telling me a list, a story, anything....nah I'm done is 2.5 seconds and moving on to something else.", "Catch me asking for the arthritis cap on all my prescriptions, lol. ADHD hyperfocus + getting really into making jewelry gave me vicious carpal tunnel."]}
