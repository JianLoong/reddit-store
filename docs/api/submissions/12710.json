At some point she will figure out how to get them off or do something else equally dangerous (metal in the microwave? the toaster?) and you will pay the price. It is not worth living together if she is going to put your life in danger constantly. \n\nMove out. If you can\u2019t right now then you need to get insurance and be on alert at all times.

Basic safety measures to prevent someone from burning down your place of residence after they've proved themselves incapable of proper diligence is just common sense.", "NTA,\n\nIf her parents are really concerned for their safety, the OP should ask them to buy a modern stove/oven with an auto-shut off and an alarm (but if the range is electric, maybe it doesn't need to be replaced, because it should be possible to install a third party device that automatically shuts off the electricity).\n\nThis way, it becomes the parent's problem to solve, not hers.\n\nAnd they should also consider buying a fire alarm system for deaf people. It's basically a fire alarm that sets off strobe lights in every room, in addition to the alarm sound.\n\nBut just to be safe, I think the OP should make sure she has good fire/renter's insurance as well. She should inventory all of her possessions and have pictures/receipts. She should get a fireproof lockbox for important documents. And she should have a go-bag ready just in case.\n\nThis child lock thing won't work forever, especially if the parents get involved. With the right tool, even a 90 year old with frail hands can easily open child locks. Plus, if the sister remains with a friend, she's just as likely to set that place on fire and kill herself if these precautions are not taken (to which, the parents will never forgive the OP).\n\nPersonally, I would do all the research necessary, I'd take the measurements, I'd read the reviews, I'd select the model, I'd include the price of delivery and installation, and then I'd email the parents and place the ball in their court. This way, the OP would have a time stamped record of her attempt to resolve the situation, should the worst happen.", "Wait until she nearly burns her *friend's* house down lmao.  But uh, maybe warn her friend if you can", "My sis and bil have really clever cat and a gas stove. They had to go through three sets of childproof stove knobs because the CAT could open  them.

He learned how to open his cage door.  We got a chain and a lock to keep it closed.  It took him less than five minutes to get the lock off.

Especially since the instructions are usually on the lock somewhere.\n\nIt does sound like she has a developmental disability.", "I have mild cerebral palsy and it affects my hands, so I have a hard time with child-proof items. Years ago I was baby-sitting my 3 year old nephew and they had a child-lock on the door knob to stop him from getting out (this was almost 20 years ago). I put him down to sleep and realized I couldn't open the door, so I eventually pried it off and then put it back together. My nephew was still awake and watched me do it, a few days later his parents wondered how he got out of his room and sure enough he had pried it apart.", "This isn\u2019t OP\u2019s problem to solve, but I\u2019m pretty concerned for the friend that is currently hosting Nicole. I\u2019m sure that whatever version of the story that friend heard did not include \u201cmy stepsister is mad at me because I nearly started a kitchen fire on two separate occasions.\u201d If the friend knew that, they may have made a different decision about allowing Nicole to stay in their place, which presumably also has a kitchen.", "I remember when I was a kid my mom asking me to open pill bottles.

Thank all that is holy I didn't burn anything down, any of those times.\n\nThe way I fixed this, for myself, is by buying a massive gaudy plastic ring at CVS. My rule is: If I have any fire lit in the house - whether candle, or fire for cooking - I wear that ring. I have a special place to keep it if I'm not wearing it, too; my rule is to go get the ring and put it on my finger before I turn a stovetop dial or light a match.\n\nThis has worked like a charm, for over 5 years now!", " I have ADHD, I have burned top ramen and hard boiled eggs", "Sounds like more than adhd.

I've left it on all night and forgotten it for many hours at a time- fortunately the worst of it happened in the summer and I don't have air conditioning so I was really sensitive to *damn my kitchen is fucking hot*. \n\nI mean, obviously I've taken precautions since then that have succeeded and failed as I worked through them, but it definitely happens due to the ADHD.\n\nOP is 100% correct about adding the child locks though, sometimes you have to force an accommodation onto someone for the safety of everyone. The sister might just be ADHD and ALSO a careless asshole.", "I desperately need to get tested for ADHD. But frankly, I keep forgetting to schedule testing\u2026.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve nearly set my apartment on fire before. I had been cooking beans on the stove all day while I was working at the kitchen table. Turned off the stove, went to class, came back and turned it on high to warm them up again so they could keep cooking. Fully intended to turn it back down to low once I grabbed my clean clothes. Nope, didn\u2019t remember. Hopped in the shower and scrambled out 10 minutes later to the smoke detector going off. Middle of January I was running around with just a towel on, frantically opening every window and door, grabbing my cat and putting her in a carrier in the hallway so she wouldn\u2019t breathe the smoke and/or escape, carrying the burnt beans outside and dumping them in a pile of snow while barefoot. My neighbors weren\u2019t happy. I wasn\u2019t either because I had put a day of work into those beans.\n\nI haven\u2019t forgotten to turn the stove off in the 14 months since, but I am constantly triple checking and saying out loud that I turned the stove off before exiting the kitchen.", "I wonder if she have bigger attention/memory issues than OP knows and that's why she reacted so violently to the notes reminding her?

She's an adult and still is responsible for her actions. But acting like one person's experience with a disorder defines everyone's is foolish, and it's equally foolish to act like acknowledging that some conditions can make certain things harder is excusing the failure to do those things\n\nFor anyone like me who's trying to figure out a trick for it, once I start the oven I have a special timer that I set that's near it that's just for the 'check everything is off' reminder. I'm often cooking multiple things that need to go in and out of the oven, so I can't just turn it off whenever I take one thing out of the oven. With my timer, as soon as I start preheating, I put on however long I need to cook, or the longest estimated time I can come up with, about 10 minutes to preheat, and an extra 5 in case something needs to go back in for a minute, then leave it to the side. There have been times when I was done cooking and completely forgot the oven, before this saved me.

ADHD has no effect on one\u2019s ability to understand that burning the house down is bad and should be avoided. \n\nSide note, I highly recommend induction cooktops. They don\u2019t prevent pots from boiling over but they will stop you from setting towels and paper plates on fire, and they cool down fast so less chance of putting something on a still-hot burner by mistake.", "Reasoning so bad it is mind-blowing.

Like, I've met way more people who pick locks at those support groups than in the two decades prior.\n\nI can't imagine a child lock keeping me out of anything. Not even as a child.\n\nI know some people in the comments disagree but the idea that having ADHD might prevent someone from figuring out a child lock is a little absurd imo. It's the complete opposite of my experience. \n\nActually, there's an acronym that defines what is required to engage an ADHD brain, ICNU. Interest, Challenge, Novelty, and Urgency.

I also have anxiety so very rarely ever left a burner on or anything, but I often WORRIED about it, and being able to just look at it and know for sure I've turned all the burners off is A++++.
