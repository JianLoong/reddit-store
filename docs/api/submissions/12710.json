At some point she will figure out how to get them off or do something else equally dangerous (metal in the microwave? the toaster?) and you will pay the price. It is not worth living together if she is going to put your life in danger constantly. \n\nMove out. If you can\u2019t right now then you need to get insurance and be on alert at all times.

I had to get an electric tea kettle. After he went off the meds all was fine. Funny fact. 2 years to the day I tore my rotator cuff and went on the same meds with the same results I would leave the stove on. I cook the meals, so we bought an induction burner.

We bought a child lock for the cabinet. The little monster hulk ripped the lock off. So we replaced it with a better one, which he learned to open in a matter of minutes.

Can be funny (like when he sorted the contents of the compost by sort into little piles on the floor until he reached his goal article) or freaking expensive when it includes a trip to the vet clinic.

Vader jumped on top of the fridge and knocked the box down for him. Puck didn't have possession of the lone orange brain cell, so he just stared at the box and howled.

He takes his prize to the designated place for eating his snacks like the good boy he is. He managed to shake an ironing board in a way that the Belgian chocolate fell down but the board itself stood still. Recently he stole from the table for the first time. My friend carelessly placed chicken wings there. As the bones are dangerous he was on a Sauerkraut and oil diet for two days afterwards. Which meant that his favourite chewing treat had to wait on a shelf above what he can reach for a little. He didn't like that.
