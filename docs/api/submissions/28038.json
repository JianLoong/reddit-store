Around this time of the year my allergies like to mess with me and I get nose bleeds sometimes. (Nothing too serious, but usually if I blow my nose a lot there\u2019s blood spotting). Well one of my coworkers (31M) who\u2019s a good friend noticed this. Well about a week ago he saw me blowing my nose again and jokingly said \u201cAre you doing cocaine or something?\u201d. I said no and explained my allergies and we just laughed. Now whenever he\u2019d see me blowing my nose he\u2019d say \u201cstop doing that coke\u201d and I reply something like \u201cno\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop\u201d. (TO BE CLEAR I AM NOT DOING COKE AND HE KNOWS IM NOT, ITS JUST JOKING AND WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARENT AROUND)\n\nWell a couple weeks ago, a fellow resident (30F) who is in our year overheard us say that when she was outside the room we were in I guess and she reported me. Then I got called in and questioned, I explained the situation & how they can literally see on my medical chart I have a history of allergies, but they still drug tested me which of course came up negative, but I\u2019m still gonna have to get drug tested routinely for the next month \u201cjust to be sure\u201d. I was told I\u2019m not in trouble or anything and can continue work, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less embarrassing! Well I ended up finding out who it was that reported me. And I was so pissed because I literally could\u2019ve gotten fired and my whole career would\u2019ve been on the line.\n\nWell a few days ago, I invited a most of my colleagues to a big event I\u2019m having in a few weeks. I never confronted that colleague and have just been keeping my distance for the sake of professionalism and definitely did not invite her. The day after I sent the invitations out (which was a flier through direct message) the colleague approached me and asked me why didn\u2019t I send her an invitation, guess she heard about it from others. I was honest and told her it was because she falsely reported me and almost got me fired. She said she was just trying to do what was right and I can\u2019t blame her because the risk that I was high and operating on patients is too great. I said \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from, but instead of asking me about it you went directly to our superior and almost cost me my career., which you haven\u2019t apologized for\u201d. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna apologize for doing the right thing. Then I said I had to check on a patient and walked away. \n\nI get she was trying to do the right thing, but she ended up doing it to the wrong person and  thinks she\u2019s in the right. Well I disagree and don\u2019t want her at my event now, but I do feel kind of bad for excluding her and am curious to if she is right and if I\u2019m just being stubborn. \n\nSo AITA for excluding my worker for after she reported me and almost got me fired?\n\nEdit: To those saying it didn\u2019t effect me, I had to miss a day of work because I couldn\u2019t go back until the results came. So that is hours I will have to make up and I\u2019m already taking time off for future maternity leave\n\n\u201cIs it a work or personal event? If personal, why are you inviting colleagues to a personal event?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a personal event. Baby shower to be exact. I\u2019m only in the 2nd trimester, but am having it earlier for irrelevant reasons. I\u2019m inviting colleagues because another colleague invited most people they worked with to their wedding last year and I felt it was polite to do the same. I\u2019ve only invited people I actually work or interact with often. She is someone I interact with somewhat often so I think that\u2019s why she feels it\u2019s not fair she\u2019s getting excluded.\n\nEdit 2: \u201cThat\u2019s not funny\u201d. Some of y\u2019all have no humor. I guess my humor is more dark so I can see how some plain people wouldn\u2019t find it funny\n\nEdit 3: for those asking how I found out: My friend/colleague, the one who was joking with me, was talking to her about something the day I had to miss while waiting for the results. And she asked if I was coming in that day because I was on the schedule before and he said that I couldn\u2019t come in today. And I guess she took that as I fired and said \u201coh good, she needs help\u201d. Then I guess she admitted she was the one who reported and he explained the context of the situation then said she was like \u201cOh okay\u201d\n\nEdit 4: \u201cAre you intentionally not inviting her because she reported you?\u201d I guess yes because she was on my initial list of people to send the invites to. But I no longer feel comfortable having someone that reported me around me on a personal aspect and do not need that at my baby shower", "created_utc": 1696221238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xn74c/aita_for_excluding_a_coworker_30f_after_she/", "score": 1959, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can keep being bitter but in a professional environment again you want to avoid jokes like that, and I can say this even working at a very different field from you. Just that understand this is the milieu we live in we do have to be more conscious about this thing. I can say personally we've had misunderstandings like this happen in my work place (I'm operations risk so I'm briefed on the potential and actual cases), and yes they ended up being called by their superior to explain -- from the one at the top of my head this was a guy of sexual harassment since his interaction with a friend was also misconstrued (and the woman who reported obviously wasn't feeling safe to confront him).

Not the option to convince them otherwise, simply the opportunity to deal with it professionally without blindsiding OP unnecessarily.

Given that, it\u2019s a reasonable question whether the eavesdropper deliberately reported a joke because of the competitiveness of the program, and their fomo and confrontation about the wedding shower only makes me consider more seriously that the eavesdropper friend is catty and potentially immoral in their own ways.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s an incredibly stupid joke, and hope OP has learned their lesson.

This may help HER understand, and may start to repair a bit of your working relationship, as silent treatments do nothing productive and you have to continue to coexist professionally.", "The colleague was unapologetic even after being confronted\u2026.and that is where colleague went wrong.

He said they'd have full parties and it would just be coke lines everywhere. Said he'd come home from work and sometimes they'd just be taking it and watching a movie. Apparently they didn't drink and he viewed it as them basically opting for cocaine as their choice of stimulant or drug rather than alcohol. They obviously weren't on it when working but it seems rife here for doctors/surgeons in my area to be on it.\n\nSo I actually think she was put in a difficult position and reporting it anonymously might have been right because ultimately they were talking about it in an inapproriate place where people could overhear, they are in a job where as far as I'm aware it's super common, if they had of still had it in their system and were experiencing side effects on the job they were a risk, if they were on it they would have lied anyway, and if they got checked and weren't on it at all then their job was never in jeopardy to begin with.\n\nAgain what would you or anyone else do if you were at a hospital and heard one of the surgeons talking about how they won't stop taking cocaine, immediately assume it was a joke and approach them?\n\nEdit: I see you saying they wouldn't joke about it in public. I'm in banking/financial crime, and someone literally just got sacked for doing cocaine on a work night out, because they mentioned it in front of other colleagues who grassed them in basically.

And the co-worker is a mandated reporter so per her job description she HAD to report it.", "one of the easiest tricks is to hide it in the open dude, you don't get around many drug addicts do you?", "in public and in her *place of work* (I assume since the coworker was there to overhear).", "Some people 100% would. You think to highly of others. You have to be pretty obtuse to make those jokes loudly in your workplace, too. It wasn't just bewteen close friends. The coworker overhearing makes her saying it carelessly obvious.", "The medical residents my parent worked with had zero brain to mouth filter and no common sense about what to reveal after like 42 hour shifts. especially among coworkers.  Constant stress and a truly criminal lack of sleep will do that.", "Even more if that person is pregnant and is clearly not showing any symptoms of substance abuse ! \n\nPeople here seem to lack common sense, just like that coworker.", "Yeap! Like I remember one of the coworkers I worked with joking with me and one of the contractors we were escorting just looked at us like \u201cyou\u2019re gonna let him talk to you like that!\u201d", "Hats off to you, I don\u2019t know how you do it. \n\nTotally get the need for humour.  I\u2019m sitting by my mom\u2019s deathbed waiting for her to die for the last couple of weeks (fuck cancer) and I\u2019m binge watching Taskmaster and Netflix comedy specials just to get through the day and break up the grimness.", "Was recently in a surgery where the surgeon and scrub nurse did the whole \"LeviOsah not levioSAH\" Harry Potter bit with the surgeon waving around his scalpel as if it was a wand. Anything to alleviate the boredom during a long surgery I guess. \n\nObviously that kind of humour is more wholesome than dark but probably a bit surprising to patients the joking that goes on.", "Every healthcare worker I know routinely jokes about death and you always get the feeling they're using that to  test the water and that the rest of their humor is even more crass.", "It's such an inane throwaway joke in any environment. I honestly think there are people here who would rather see us all become braindead zombies. Honestly, it might be better if more of these guys *did* do some drugs. Maybe then they wouldn't be such fucking stiffs.", "The obsession with professionalism and properly servile behaviour from professionals we have as a society is actual sick. Pathological. I don't give a shit if the doctor patching me up has a dark sense of humour, I care how capable they are.", "Some of them would be absolutely paralyzed in horror at military humor!!", "I work in an ER. All we do during what little downtime we get is throw jokes at each other, and yes, some of them are inappropriate. Sometimes even highly inappropriate, but like you said, we work in an extremely high stress environment, and being able to laugh- even at something morbid, crude, or just plain \u201cwrong\u201d, well, it helps. \n\nHell, we were literally joking about weed just a few hours ago. (I worked last night). We\u2019ve joked about cocaine. We\u2019ve joked about burns, GSWs (gun shot wounds for the uninitiated). We joke about whatever we can, whenever we can, because there are way too many nights, and way too many times when something happens that breaks our hearts and fucks up our whole world. We see absolutely terrible shit, and if we don\u2019t find something to joke about- doesn\u2019t matter what it is- we would lose not just our minds but our will to carry on working in a job that is too often thankless and heartbreaking.", "The absolute DARKEST people are the forensic nursing staff. When you take rape kits and interview victims all day every day it's the only way to avoid being crushed under the horrific weight of it.", "Look \nWe learn about context clues in elementary and middle school.  If the girl that overheard them joking and laughing about drug use couldn't tell they were joking, she's too stupid to be a surgeon and much riskier in this job than OP.  \nIf she had overheard a conversation where the friend sounded genuinely concerned and OP was saying \"I know I need help\" or \"mind your business, I'm going to do what I want\", then she has reason to be concerned and report the issue.", "I guess that entitles her to go to the baby shower of the person she reported then?", "Ffs, op is pregnant, how many pregnant medical residents abuse drugs and yell and joke about it with others in a place where other coworkers can also hear ?! You really need to be obtuse to suddenly jump to conclusions and report her. And even more obtuse to not apologize and expect to get invited to the baby shower after making op go through all the consequences of an easily avoidable report that will follow her for the rest of her career.", "No, it's just a lot of people on this site are really boring (like *really* fucking boring). I mean, have you seen the main page 'humor' subs? It's so middle of the middlebrow to the point of being non-exsistant.

She was constantly \u201cjoking\u201d about it too.", "This isn\u2019t a dark joke though, just a lame one that has a major propensity to backfire.", "Actually depends on the airport. There are definitely airports where it\u2019s absolutely a crime", "I\u2019m pretty sure most drugs like coke are illegal though", "No. But, if she had approched her, she could explain how her allergies cause nosebleeds, how she's pregnant and if still unsure, maybe ask her to look at her record for it. She also could have asked the male coworker who can explain it was a joke. If they laughed if off and didn't explain anything, then reporting is fair. There are a fair few inappropriate jokes said in the hospital. The typical course is raising concerns with the colleague then escalating if neccessary.", "Based on personal experience, nearly all of them use cocaine.", "I am a doctor and the vast majority if my friends group are doctors and I have yet to meet one who does cocaine that is still a doctor.  I have run up against 2 over the last 25 years.  One didn\u2019t make it through Med school and the other lost his license very quickly.  Although self medication with alcohol isn\u2019t uncommon within the profession, you will not last with heavy alcohol or drug use.  Plus, other stimulants heavier than caffeine will lead to significant problems.  The assumption that we are all high is patently false.", "Really depends on the coworkers tbh. I worked in pharmacy for a year and I recall the head pharmacist calling the safe the \"party cabinet\" on more than one occasion. Never if a customer was there, obviously, but among us employees.", "And you really expect someone to be friendly with someone that reported them? Really?", "I worked on state child abuse hotline for years: nothing can surprise me anymore.\n\nIn what world is anyone mandated to report something overheard taken out of context?\n\nI'm familiar with mandated reporters of suspected child abuse/neglect.

It's for child or elderly abuse. Not being a narc.", "When worked in a pharmacy/methadone clinic, our boss bought the clientele of an old one that was about to close and we transferred all the drugs to ours, including the 500g jar of cocaine. We laughed so much when we found it, made so much jokes, including many tasteless ones with our boss who\u2019s of Italian descent of how we were gonna get rid of it we almost pissed our pants. Of course we joke about stuff like this!\n\nResidents work ungodly hours for little money. Dark humour is all they have", "You\u2019re throwing around mandated reporter as if you know what it means - and you don\u2019t", "You should be very surprised. Check the stats on drug use in the medical profession, it is rampant.", "Oh god, I'm a nurse and I joke all the time about throwing back the waste amount of controlled substances when I waste a partial med with someone. But we know each other well, and watch each other throw out the waste. And you can't hear anything outside the med room, so I don't have to worry about anyone overhearing and getting the wrong idea", "So sorry to hear about you mom. I'm sending you my warmest hug,", "I'd  probably then pretend to levitate the gall bladder/bowel/offending organ out of the patient during the op. But that may be too far.\n\nHealthcare is a weird space and humour helps you enjoy your job, and helps you dissociate from the more serious things.", "Maybe but shouldn\u2019t he have been I trouble for not reporting it?", ">The female resident should have asked the male resident if he thought OP was using cocaine.  He most likely would have told her the whole story and that it was a joke.\n\nyeah, he would probably say it's a joke, regardless of OP's drug use. That's the problem. Because if OP is doing drugs then he is covering for her.", "How have you arrived at this \"personal experience'. I have been a part of a very stressful residency and now supervise residents I have yet to find any resident who uses cocaine.", "Really? I find that at odds with my >25 years of experience. Drug and alcohol use are not conducive to being a physician or surgeon.  All of those that I have run into have failed at it and are no longer practicing.  Your experience is not real.", "Frankly, I'd be surprised to learn someone wasn't using a stimulant during residency. And that's just from my experience on the patient side of things", "I was talking about the joke about it part.", "Yeah its so ridiculous. Who would think they deserve to escape any social consequences?", "Yup. Current social worker for child welfare. \n\nHoly shit. \n\nIf every parent/person/conversation that I vaguely overheard talking about drug use or other dubious behavior in jest I felt like I HAD to report, I would get talked to. \n\nPeople don\u2019t get that part of the mandatory reporter training means an ACTUAL concern for the health or wellbeing of someone with diminished capacity. \n\nA side joke about cocaine in a hospital (where staff are known for gallows humor, just like CW workers are) I would say \u201cwhose having the coke party? My nose is wet.\u201d\n\nAnd then we would move on. Because none of this should get your hackles up if you have any brain at all. \n\nFfs. \n\nThe biggest thing in MR training is how to use your own discretion and only report if you suspect abuse or threat. \n\nThis medical professional is going to have a hard time in her career if a single joke about drugs without context makes her feel the need to report a coworker.  \n\nI hope she goes into peds or hospice. So she can be offended by every joke anyone makes to try to lighten the mood.", "Former high school counselor and boy do we have a dark sense of humor.
