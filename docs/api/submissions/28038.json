Around this time of the year my allergies like to mess with me and I get nose bleeds sometimes. (Nothing too serious, but usually if I blow my nose a lot there\u2019s blood spotting). Well one of my coworkers (31M) who\u2019s a good friend noticed this. Well about a week ago he saw me blowing my nose again and jokingly said \u201cAre you doing cocaine or something?\u201d. I said no and explained my allergies and we just laughed. Now whenever he\u2019d see me blowing my nose he\u2019d say \u201cstop doing that coke\u201d and I reply something like \u201cno\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop\u201d. (TO BE CLEAR I AM NOT DOING COKE AND HE KNOWS IM NOT, ITS JUST JOKING AND WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARENT AROUND)\n\nWell a couple weeks ago, a fellow resident (30F) who is in our year overheard us say that when she was outside the room we were in I guess and she reported me. Then I got called in and questioned, I explained the situation & how they can literally see on my medical chart I have a history of allergies, but they still drug tested me which of course came up negative, but I\u2019m still gonna have to get drug tested routinely for the next month \u201cjust to be sure\u201d. I was told I\u2019m not in trouble or anything and can continue work, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less embarrassing! Well I ended up finding out who it was that reported me. And I was so pissed because I literally could\u2019ve gotten fired and my whole career would\u2019ve been on the line.\n\nWell a few days ago, I invited a most of my colleagues to a big event I\u2019m having in a few weeks. I never confronted that colleague and have just been keeping my distance for the sake of professionalism and definitely did not invite her. The day after I sent the invitations out (which was a flier through direct message) the colleague approached me and asked me why didn\u2019t I send her an invitation, guess she heard about it from others. I was honest and told her it was because she falsely reported me and almost got me fired. She said she was just trying to do what was right and I can\u2019t blame her because the risk that I was high and operating on patients is too great. I said \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from, but instead of asking me about it you went directly to our superior and almost cost me my career., which you haven\u2019t apologized for\u201d. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna apologize for doing the right thing. Then I said I had to check on a patient and walked away. \n\nI get she was trying to do the right thing, but she ended up doing it to the wrong person and  thinks she\u2019s in the right. Well I disagree and don\u2019t want her at my event now, but I do feel kind of bad for excluding her and am curious to if she is right and if I\u2019m just being stubborn. \n\nSo AITA for excluding my worker for after she reported me and almost got me fired?\n\nEdit: To those saying it didn\u2019t effect me, I had to miss a day of work because I couldn\u2019t go back until the results came. So that is hours I will have to make up and I\u2019m already taking time off for future maternity leave\n\n\u201cIs it a work or personal event? If personal, why are you inviting colleagues to a personal event?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a personal event. Baby shower to be exact. I\u2019m only in the 2nd trimester, but am having it earlier for irrelevant reasons. I\u2019m inviting colleagues because another colleague invited most people they worked with to their wedding last year and I felt it was polite to do the same. I\u2019ve only invited people I actually work or interact with often. She is someone I interact with somewhat often so I think that\u2019s why she feels it\u2019s not fair she\u2019s getting excluded.\n\nEdit 2: \u201cThat\u2019s not funny\u201d. Some of y\u2019all have no humor. I guess my humor is more dark so I can see how some plain people wouldn\u2019t find it funny\n\nEdit 3: for those asking how I found out: My friend/colleague, the one who was joking with me, was talking to her about something the day I had to miss while waiting for the results. And she asked if I was coming in that day because I was on the schedule before and he said that I couldn\u2019t come in today. And I guess she took that as I fired and said \u201coh good, she needs help\u201d. Then I guess she admitted she was the one who reported and he explained the context of the situation then said she was like \u201cOh okay\u201d", "created_utc": 1696221238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xn74c/aita_for_excluding_a_coworker_30f_after_she/", "score": 264, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can keep being bitter but in a professional environment again you want to avoid jokes like that, and I can say this even working at a very different field from you. Just that understand this is the milieu we live in we do have to be more conscious about this thing. I can say personally we've had misunderstandings like this happen in my work place (I'm operations risk so I'm briefed on the potential and actual cases), and yes they ended up being called by their superior to explain -- from the one at the top of my head this was a guy of sexual harassment since his interaction with a friend was also misconstrued (and the woman who reported obviously wasn't feeling safe to confront him).

Her failure to apologize and instead try to justify her behavior says that she is someone you want to have as little contact with as possible.\n\nHopefully the event is amazing and your coworker gets to hear all about it from everyone who attended.

Second of all, doctors failing to speak up when they see another doctor doing something wrong is a huge problem in the medical field, that contributes to worse outcomes for patients as well as a toxic workplace for other medical professionals. Your coworker should be commended for her bravery and her strong ethics. Third of all, you're 30 years old and you're a doctor. Stop joking about doing drugs in the workplace.

These are the consequences of immaturity in a really important field of work-pee in the cup, take this as a valuable lesson learned, and conduct yourself with dignity and grace.
