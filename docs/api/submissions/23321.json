{"id": 23321, "submission_id": "15bvsl8", "title": "AITA For not inviting my friend to my wedding, because she doesn't drink?", "selftext": "I want to clarify that my friend, let's call her A, doesn't drink, not because of any trauma or health conditions, but simply because she doesn't like the taste and how it makes her feel. While she did drink a bit between ages 21 and 23, she never overdid it and eventually decided it wasn't for her.\n\nOur friend group is now in our late 20s and early 30s, and A is the only one who abstains from drinking. That's totally fine with all of us, and we meet up as a group once a month for planned activities followed by dinner at a restaurant or someone's house.\n\nWhen we go to a restaurant, A never orders alcohol, which is perfectly okay. However, I've noticed that when everyone else has a few drinks, she seems a bit out of place. She becomes quieter and doesn't laugh much, and I admit I've felt judged by her in those moments.\n\nLately, A has been excusing herself earlier than the rest of us, explaining that she feels uncomfortable when people are tipsy, and she doesn't want anyone to worry about her. While I understand her feelings, I've noticed that some others in the group have started to drink less or delay drinking until she leaves, even though she never asked them to do so. It's almost like her presence unintentionally influences them to stay sober.\n\nAdditionally, I've observed that when A isn't around, we tend to have a lot more fun. We can go dancing, have a few drinks, and not worry about being judged. Having that freedom is really refreshing, and I admit, I've started hoping that she wouldn't be present in such situations.\n\nNow, with my wedding approaching, I had a talk with A about it. I wanted everyone to have a blast at the wedding, and I know she feels uncomfortable around drunk people. I also noticed that others tend to adjust their drinking habits when she's around. So, I gently suggested that it might be better for her to sit this one out, so she wouldn't feel out of place and people wouldn't feel the need to limit their enjoyment on her account.\n\nSurprisingly, A took it well and understood my perspective. However, I decided not to tell the rest of our friends about the situation to avoid drama. But  apparently  A has tattled to the rest of the group. Now, i am being told that my decision is messed up and that I'm an asshole for not inviting her.\n\nI also learned that apparent As feelings were hurt. But she told me she's fine so how should I have known that. \n\nI'm feeling quite confused because all I wanted was for my friends to enjoy the wedding day without any worries. I didn't mean to hurt A's feelings, and I genuinely thought it was the best solution for everyone.", "created_utc": 1690546486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bvsl8/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friend_to_my_wedding/", "score": 231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s frustrating because it makes the hangout uncomfortable for no reason at all. \n\nI promise you she probably isn\u2019t judging you and you have some deep insecurities about your alcohol consumption.

You are clearly NOT A's \"friend\". And in this situation you weren't even a good person. She doesn't pressure anyone, whine, force her abstinence on people or make them change plans.

There's nothing wrong with leaving early,  or with not being comfortable around people who drink. \n\nYou can enjoy a wedding,  and enjoy spending time with your friends,  and not drink.

But let's invite Uncle Pete, who is a louse and drunk that b**ts his wife & kids because he is so much fun after he's had a few!\n\nWho do you think you are trying to save your friend's feelings by making a decision that is hers to make?  If she is uncomfortable, she can decline the invite.  That's what adults do.  Instead you have demonstrated that you are not her friend - you don't trust that she is capable of making the adult decision by herself, so controlling little you just make it for her without any input from her.  Way to go.  You just ruined a friendship not only with her but also possibly with others in the group.\n\nDid it occur to you that if she was that uncomfortable, she would have been declining the invites to go out long before now?\n\nWell, I guess this is just another example of having to live with the consequences of your actions.

The fact that you \"feel\" judged is on you.\n2. From your post and the background information given, it almost sounds like you guys are not capable of having fun without alcohol.

There's no reason for any of you to feel awkward just because she is one person out of however many guests who isn't drinking. Uninviting her for this reason is a shitty thing to do.\n\nHonestly, it seems less like it's about the wedding and more about the possibility that you, over time, have decided that A isn't really someone you consider a good friend.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI want to clarify that my friend, let's call her A, doesn't drink, not because of any trauma or health conditions, but simply because she doesn't like the taste and how it makes her feel. While she did drink a bit between ages 21 and 23, she never overdid it and eventually decided it wasn't for her.\n\nOur friend group is now in our late 20s and early 30s, and A is the only one who abstains from drinking. That's totally fine with all of us, and we meet up as a group once a month for planned activities followed by dinner at a restaurant or someone's house.\n\nWhen we go to a restaurant, A never orders alcohol, which is perfectly okay. However, I've noticed that when everyone else has a few drinks, she seems a bit out of place. She becomes quieter and doesn't laugh much, and I admit I've felt judged by her in those moments.\n\nLately, A has been excusing herself earlier than the rest of us, explaining that she feels uncomfortable when people are tipsy, and she doesn't want anyone to worry about her. While I understand her feelings, I've noticed that some others in the group have started to drink less or delay drinking until she leaves, even though she never asked them to do so. It's almost like her presence unintentionally influences them to stay sober.\n\nAdditionally, I've observed that when A isn't around, we tend to have a lot more fun. We can go dancing, have a few drinks, and not worry about being judged. Having that freedom is really refreshing, and I admit, I've started hoping that she wouldn't be present in such situations.\n\nNow, with my wedding approaching, I had a talk with A about it. I wanted everyone to have a blast at the wedding, and I know she feels uncomfortable around drunk people. I also noticed that others tend to adjust their drinking habits when she's around. So, I gently suggested that it might be better for her to sit this one out, so she wouldn't feel out of place and people wouldn't feel the need to limit their enjoyment on her account.\n\nSurprisingly, A took it well and understood my perspective. However, I decided not to tell the rest of our friends about the situation to avoid drama. But  apparently  A has tattled to the rest of the group. Now, i am being told that my decision is messed up and that I'm an asshole for not inviting her.\n\nI also learned that apparent As feelings were hurt. But she told me she's fine so how should I have known that. \n\nI'm feeling quite confused because all I wanted was for my friends to enjoy the wedding day without any worries. I didn't mean to hurt A's feelings, and I genuinely thought it was the best solution for everyone.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would just apologize and try and extend an invitation if that\u2019s the only reason she didn\u2019t get one.", "YTA on this one I'm afraid and I absolutely love a drink. It sounds like A would excuse herself if she felt uncomfortable and let's face it at a wedding people aren't exactly going to hold back just because of one person.

So I guess you should limit contact with her, but that means you bowing out of events she\u2019s going to be at and not the other way around.\n\nShe probably would have put her dislike of drunk people (the only people who like drunk people are other drunk people, btw, because drunk people are exhausting) aside in order to celebrate your special day. & if she couldn\u2019t? That was up to her to decide and convey via her RRSP.\n\nAgain, this is a friend?

She enjoys being out with you all and yet you feel judged. Of course she is going to say it\u2019s ok about not being invited - would it have made a difference because you decided she was a party pooper and judgemental. We\u2019re you going to change your mind?  No. It\u2019s not fair to blame her for your hang ups about what constitutes a good time. You are not her friend cause friends don\u2019t do that - last thought- how would you feel if she said to you I don\u2019t want you at my wedding cause you drink and act ridiculous?", "Of course YTA.  You told your friend you didn\u2019t want her at your wedding, and thus implicitly told her you don\u2019t value her friendship.

Anyone\u2019s feelings would be hurt to find out that\u2019s what their friend thinks of them. \n\nTo put it into perspective, one of my very best friends just got married and she drinks a lot. Her whole family drinks a lot and most of our friends drink a lot. We have one friend that is incredibly reserved when it comes to alcohol, almost never drinks and if she does she has only one.

If your other friends actively lower their alcohol intake out of respect for your sober friend, I don't see why that bothers you.

There are a few individuals in my grad program who don't drink and tend to get judgy/give us who do drink flack for when we start drinking at social events. It can sour the mood a bit and absolutely causes us to either organize exclusive drinking events without them or wait until these individuals have left to really get going.\n\nHowever, that's just I think how it's supposed to work, and we are still friends with those people even though they don't drink. We go out of our way to include them when we can because we value them separate from their drinking ability. \n\nI think the issue here is one of priorities. At a wedding, some people come because there is alcohol and a party, and others come because they are your family and *friends* who want to support you and celebrate a life event with you. I personally think that second one is what you'll want to remember more than getting drunk on your wedding night. And this isn't to say you can't have both. Have everyone over, and then have a set time when drinks are served and people who don't drink, like your friend, can quietly excuse themselves. \n\nSo YTA, but I don't think it has to stay that way.
