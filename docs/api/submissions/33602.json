I don't understand the people who have commented that you should have discussed it with the mother first. \n\nDid SHE discuss with OP and take his opinion into consideration when she unilaterally decided that the kid's hair would NEVER be cut?

You\u2019re his parent, too, and allowing him to have some say in his appearance is good.  Why does mom forbid haircuts for her own aesthetic?", "NTA. He's 12, he should be old enough to decide how his hair looks.

Maybe take the oportunity to let him know that you have his back and is willing to hear him when he needs.\n\nMy father has had long hair his whole life and he tried to pull something like this when I was little, because my hair was exactly like his he tried to forbid cutting it. It worked only until the day I told mom I didnt want long hair anymore - we went for a short \u201cchanel\u201d bob the same day. Dad was not amused but mom had my back and I loved her so much for that.", "NTA. It\u2019s his hair, not hers.

He\u2019s old enough to decide what he wants to do with his own hair.

However, a rule that a 12 year old is \"not allowed' to get a normal haircut (I'm assuming this wasn't a green mohawk) is overly controlling and nonsensical. He was going to defy her and cut his hair eventually; at least this way you can take the flack on behalf of your kid.", "NTA.  But I totally get where she's coming from.  The shock of it must have hit her and she really wanted to keep his hair long.  Not that I agree with her but my mom flipped when my dad got me a haircut way back when.  Even so she's just going to have to get over it.  It was your son's choice to get the haircut as it should be.  Mom's gonna have to let go over the hair thing.  You should let her know he's too old for her to not let the decision be his.  I feel like 12 is a good age for a kid to have some autonomy over their hair.", "INFO: please tell me Bernard is a fake name", "[deleted]", "ESH (except the kids) neither you or your ex seem very good at communicating or compromising. Your ex is the TA because of her stubborn refusal of a hair cut (unless there is some religious reason you didn't include in the post) and you are TA for doing something you knew your ex didn't want and instead of trying to come to a compromise you just went ahead and did it anyway. Both you and your ex need to mature a lot and coparent better.", "YTA\n\nIt's clear that this was his choice but also that his mother didn't want him to cut his hair. Considering the child only visits you at weekends, you aren't his main parent and I think you should leave decisions like that to the mother.\n\nBut considering he's 12, it's probably time that you had a chat with your ex about this issue, communicating as parents of this child, about him wanting a different hairstyle and her not allowing it.

My dad was of course involved in decisions, but my mother took charge as she was the main parent.\n\nI do think kids of any age should be able to choose their own hairstyle but taking your child to get their haircut when you know the other parent disagrees is an ahole move to do. The adult thing to do is to have a discussion with the mother (in this case, the main parent) about this issue to see if she can come around to their child getting older and wanting to choose his own hairstyle.
