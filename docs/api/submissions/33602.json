They could do whatever they wanted to with their hair once they were old enough to care for it themselves, and as long as it didn't violate the school rules.  So until about second grade, they got haircuts - not shaved/buzzed, but normal haircuts.  Once able to wash/care for it themselves, their choice. So, on the elementary level no \"unnatural\" hair colors like blue or green.  In high school, my middle son (age 15) dyed his hair blue (it was allowed at the high school level).  He asked me first and I told him it was his choice, he just had to pay for the dye himself.  My oldest let his grow until it was the middle of his back.  Youngest always wanted short.", "Nta\n\nYour kids mother sound abusive and unhinged", "Unless there's some unmentioned cultural issue regarding long hair, which I know Native and Sikh communities both have,which might mitigate the mother's reaction somewhat, given your son's age, the kid's wishes and bodily autonomy take precedence here. NTA", "NTA. At 12, your kid is old enough to know what he wants, and a haircut isn't going to hurt anyone. Plus, he's in middle school, and kids are ruthless, so it's possible that before his hair got him made fun of. \n\nI'm a woman, but I've kept my hair short because it's easier to manage in the mornings, so I can't imagine how much his hair would've been to brush/shampoo.\n\nThe mom kinda needs to back off imo.", "NTA. If you had done it against his will that would be one thing, but he *wanted* the haircut- his mom is the dick for forcing him to keep it long. Imagine making your literal child keep his hair long even if he doesn't like it because of your specific lifestyle and aesthetic. Ridiculous when any parent does it", "NTA - your ex is not respecting your child\u2019s bodily autonomy. You should co-parent and get along with exes for the kids, but that doesn\u2019t extend to tolerating outright harmful behavior from the other parent.", "A kid that age can choose their own hairstyle. Unless they want offensive symbols shaved into it, a parent should stand back and grant a kid autonomy.", "NTA it\u2019s your kid too not just hers ever heard the old joke if you put money into a Pepsi machine a Pepsi comes out. Is it your or the machines?? Well there ya go", "Im with you on this. \n\nI have a 9, 14, and 16 yr old ..... the 9 and 16 are mine even if i didnt give birth ... they are learning they have choices, they have a say with in reason .... ie we need to discuss before we start using chemicals in your hair and certain styles suck when they grow out but afterwards we can ho to the salon or barber and get it done. One girl wanted an undercut, she agreed a few weeks later growing it out was itchy. One boy is growing his hair back out cause he wants to. And the other kid dyes their hair wacky colors. I monitor to ensure health and hygiene, not to enforce uniforms. We all cant be peter or paul.", "Long hair is also heavy. Kids should be allowed to choose what (temporarily and harmlessly!) happens to a part of their body that is also a form of expression. I agree.", "If I could offer one piece of advice, as a full grown man who let's my hair get very shaggy, to the grumblings of a fussy dad who was military and law enforcement. Teach him how to style his hair for when the occasion calls. First and foremost, it keeps the fussing down, I even get an occasional \"your hair looks really nice today son\" from my dad. Secondly there are occasions, like weddings and funerals, where it's less about your personal preference and more about looking appropriate to the situation. Personally I hate doing it, I like my hair just above my shoulders and down over my eyes, and I work in a field where that's generally acceptable, but if the CEO is gonna be showing up to the job site, it's not always the best idea to be looking like that.", "Nah fuck that. She won\u2019t even allow him to decide his own friends", "Yep, my 2yo says no to haircuts, so no haircuts. His brothers have short hair.", "Would it? A kid shouldn't be forced into religion either", "Imagine believing that old man in clouds or some other bullshit forbids tou to cut your kids hair lmao\n\nSuch people shouldnt have kids at all", "I understand that, I was raised by a very catholic man and a mother who, while not an atheist, still asks to this day \"so why do you eat the cracker?\" (They've been married for 40 years and he goes to church daily since retiring) But at what point is the child allowed to make decisions for themselves in that regard? I think at 12 years old they can decide if they want a haircut, for whatever reasons, without it being considered sabotage on the part of the dad...but it does raise a sticky question.", "I don't disagree, but schools have rules about natural hair colour too. My 5 year old is (not so -) patiently waiting until the summer for her rainbow hair...", "Agree. My parents let me cut color and style my hair whatever I wanted, but asked me to wait until I was of age to get any alternative piercings or tattoos. \n\nI ended up with very mild ear piercings and no tattoos, but my hair has been every color of the rainbow, and every length between long a super short. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI plan to do the same for my kids.", "I'm not sure, I don't think I'd pay for a kid who is young enough that sitting still might be a problem to get their hair dyed. I liked my parents philosophy, when we started wanting crazy stuff (well mostly my sister, I'm pretty vanilla lol) it was if you want it you can pay for it. They would pay for anything standard, never had a thought or concern on length or style or anything like that. When my sister started to want to dye her hair at 12 or 13 their response was \"well you have your Christmas money or babysitting money\" which I think is more than fair.", "Hair dye isn\u2019t HARMLESS. Processing your hair in any way that requires lifting causes damage. I\u2019m not against dying hair but I would advise against informing people their children won\u2019t have damaged hair, however infinitesimally.", "Yep, my 10 year old has had long hair all his life. We get it trimmed but it has been years since it was shorter 5an his shoulders. Drives both grandma\u2019s crazy, but it is not their hair.", "I try to avoid the schools like this like the plague. Kids should be allowed to be kids, not held to absurd societal standards.", "The sitting still thing was literally the restriction I put on it. It's the last sentence.", "It grows out. It\u2019s harmless in that sense. I let both my kids dye their hair from time to time.", "Ok boomer", "Totally agree! I was told off for painting her nails a few weeks back! Every school has these standards where I am, so it's not avoidable. At least it is a good school where everything else is concerned. We try to make up for it in the holidays!", "Avoiding schools with bad rules is not easy for some people.", "No schools in my country allow unnatural hair colours unfortunately. Or none that I know of anyway. Maybe some private schools do.", "No, I understand what I meant was, if they are in the age where the thought of them sitting still might be a concern, not their ability on a case by case basis. I was  good at sitting still at 6 years old for haircuts, my older brother wasn't good at sitting still at 9 years old, I think both are too young for hair dye. I wouldn't, as a general statement, have any concerns about a 12 year old sitting still for a haircut, unless they have never had one before.", "I think we\u2019re talking from two different angles. Hair and its various colours and styles is a morally neutral issue, I was only pointing out that if you have to use developer or lightener to lift colour so your fun fashion colours can deposit, there is inherent damage no matter what. My 11yo loves having pink or blue in her hair, however it doesn\u2019t require lifting her original colour because she\u2019s already blonde.", "Lol I\u2019m 32 and have tattoos, a half shaved head and have been colouring my hair since I was 12.\n\nTo say that lightening, processing or lifting your hair any levels to deposit colour does NO damage at all is delulu.", "I never said it was."]}
