At this point, the babies don't care.

You see a clear difference in how Jackie and Carrie are treated and acted accordingly.", "NTA and send it with a lovely note about how you wish you were closer and you\u2019ll make plans to visit soon.", "NTA.  Not everything has to be exactly \"equal.\"  It's not like you didn't give your other sister a gift at all, you just wanted to do something extra nice for your sister who is having a hard time.

To me that's a bit of a YTA situation. The babies won't know yet but if you continue that way they will surely know.

You can simply say you had pressures of time when Jackie was pregnant.", "NAH\n\nAnd it's not even clear here if there is a conflict.  Jackie got everything she needed and a lot of handmade items, so she may understand and even be appreciative of the extra effort you put in for Carrie, who is not so well supported.  It's a really wonderful gesture and very thoughtful of your to do.  \n\nAs for the babies, they are babies and *years* away from this being something they would so much as notice (let alone understand) and it's unlikely to come up, IMO.  Since you live closer to Jackie's child, you'll probably have plenty of opportunities to love on her child in different ways, and this will likely never be an issue.  If the child ever feels left out, which again I think is unlikely, you can always make them a handmade gift for a future birthday.", "NTA.  You are right.  Carrie needs the support.  Jackie is 30 yrs old and apparently wants for nothing.  Carrie lives away from family and is a 20 year old kid for all intents and purposes.  There is nothing wrong with helping the one who needs it.  While I normally    go with kids should be treated the same, this is the exception.  Plus because of the distance it makes it less of a problem.", "Info: Has anyone besides you and your husband mention the discrepancies between the gifts?", "I think light YTA, by your own admission you have a good relationship with Jackie and she and her baby have down nothing wrong per se. I don't think you need to do everything the same for both babies but if my sister got my other sister a thoughtful sentimental gift for other siblings child and nothing that thoughtful for mine I would be upset. Especially given that we hang out regularly and have a decent relationship. You don't have to tit for tat everything but i also cautioun not to passively punish Jackie's baby bc the rest of your family isn't treating Carries baby as good as you think they should.", "NTA - fair does NOT mean equal, sounds like your new nibbling is going to need more from you than Jackie's kids ever might", "There's a difference between equality and equity. You've recognized that the circumstances of Carrie's life are different from Jackie, and have adapted to that need. NTA", "NAH. It is just a difference of opinion between you and your husband. Jackie had her baby a year ago and probably doesn't even remember who gave what. This small show of support for Carrie is very unlikely to hurt Jackie's feelings, I think. (If it did, you could always say it didn't occur to you to make a blanket until you saw the beautiful ones she received at her shower.)\n\nMaybe you can get Jackie on board to send Carrie a care package of baby things from home so Carrie feels loved by you both.", "NTA for sure. You have seen how your parents and family treat you and your sisters differently in a negative way, and you are respecting the differences between your situations in a positive way. I can\u2019t see anything wrong here. Equal is not always fair, never more apparent than in a situation like this.", "NTA. That was a very thoughtful gesture on your part. You're a good sister.", "People can give (or not give gifts) as they choose. Of course, there are always going to be fallouts from omitting someone. I think this really comes down to giving a gift out of a sense of wanting to versus giving out of a sense of obligation. If you give Jackie the same thing as Carrie things are likely to remain the same. If you decide not to (and that is totally your right) please understand that it will likely alter your relationship with them. More important than if you would be the a hole is would you be okay with that? I\u2019m going to say NTA, but know what direction you are going in with this.", "You are loving them both.  You are showing that love in different ways to each of them, based on their different situation and needs.  That's how love ought to be, taking their needs and situations into consideration. \n\nI think your choice is a sweet one.  I hope your sister feels the love in it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Treating people fairly is not the same thing as treating them identically. OP can simply say that she did this to make up for the fact that she is unable to be there in person.", "Yeah, I think that would be the best thing to say if OP hears any comments on one sister getting a handmade gift and not the other - \"make up for the fact that she is unable to be there in person.\""]}
