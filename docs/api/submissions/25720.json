They are planning on getting married next spring/early summer.  They have been working on putting their wedding party together and they did a video call with me (32F) a couple weeks ago to ask me to be a bridesmaid.  I of course agreed because I love them both and I am very happy for them.  \n\nHowever, during the call, and after I had already agreed to be a bridesmaid, my brother dropped a bomb on me.  He said that he hopes this doesn't cause any issues, but he wants to ask my ex-husband (30M) to be one of his groomsmen.  My initial reaction was not the best, I basically said \"What?  Why?  Are you serious? WTF?\"  \n\nFor some history, my ex and I were high school sweethearts and married young.  We were both 23 when we married and were divorced by the time we turned 25.  No infidelity or abu$e of any kind, just a toxic relationship we were too young to recognize properly and eventually we got to a point in our marriage where we just hated each other.  Thankfully, we never had kids and we were too young to have many assets, so the divorce was easy since neither of us wanted anything to do with the other.  I moved away, got a new job, and started a new life.  My ex stayed in our hometown (where my brother currently lives).  I haven't spoken to my ex in almost 5 years.  \n\nObviously, my brother has known my ex for a long time and they were always close.  Apparently, they remained close friends after the divorce even though my brother never mentioned it to me.  My brother told me that he understands this might be a bit awkward, but it's just for one day and it's not like my ex and I are going to have to walk down the aisle together.  He said they will try to do whatever they can to keep distance between us if needed, but that both me and my ex are very important people to him and he wants both of us involved in his wedding.  \n\nI know a lot of people will probably call me petty and immature, but I want nothing to do with my ex.  There's a reason I haven't spoken to him in so long, I have no desire to speak to him.  Let alone be in the same wedding party as him.  There's going to be a lot of wedding party activities that are going to involve being in close proximity to him for extended periods of time.  I want nothing to do with that.  \n\nI explained all of this to my brother and told him that if he's going to keep my ex as a groomsman, I don't think I can be a bridesmaid and I might have to reconsider even attending the wedding.  This led to a big of back and forth with my brother trying to bargain with me and convince me that it won't be that big of an issue, and me pretty much telling him this is non-negotiable for me.  \n\nSince that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.

I wouldn\u2019t just not go at all, I feel like that\u2019s a little rude. Let people have their own relationships and be civil.

It was awesome and then we got divorced (blah blah long story) \n\nNever once did I expect my family to stop talking to him, inviting him to things, etc. We had all known him our whole life.

Clearly your ex is an important person to him as are you. \n\nIf him being present at the wedding disturbs you that much, there\u2019s clearly something you aren\u2019t saying here and need to privately discuss with your brother. Otherwise you\u2019re holding a grudge and that gets you nowhere", "NTA \n\nYour brother is entitled to invite whomever he wants to his wedding, he is also allowed to ask whoever he wants to be part of his wedding party, he does not have to change his mind if he doesn\u2019t want too.\n\nHOWEVER, an invite isn\u2019t a summons. You are entitled to decline attending the wedding if it\u2019s in the best interest of your own emotional wellbeing. \n\nThe fact that your brother hasn\u2019t admitted to having a friendship with your ex for years is a clear indication he is aware of how you would feel about the situation. \n\nDo not give an ultimatum, that only leads to resentment.

There's nothing wrong with not wanting to be in the wedding and have to engage with your ex, but refusing to go, period, is a pretty hard/seemingly petty line to draw, especially if, by your own admission, you both decided to end your marriage and walk away. \n\nI think it's important to recognize that your ex seems to have no issue being in a wedding with you and seems fine staying in his lane, so while the rest of your family shouldn't be bothering you, you have to realize that in comparison to him, you do look petty and immature, because you're unwilling to put past grudges behind you for one day to support someone you supposedly love.\n\nIt sounds like the real reason you're upset has nothing to do with the fact your ex will be there; it's that your brother remained friends with your ex. And it's understandable to be upset that it feels like someone you loved didn't take your side; however, you need to have an honest conversation with your brother. You need to actually communicate that it hurts that he was just able to overlook everything that led to the end of your marriage and stay friends with your ex. \n\nYour feelings are not invalid, but if you love your brother and want to maintain a relationship with him, you need to talk with him about the real reason you're upset, and figure out a way to move forward.", "Or, your brother could support you by picking a different groomsman and explaining that: really sorry, bud, gotta support my sister on this one.

You obviously don't *have* to go, but if you don't, you're basically giving your brother the finger. You knew that your brother was close to this person before you got together, so it shouldn't actually be that big of a surprise that they're still close, even though the two of you split. There wasn't any abuse or cheating, just two people who weren't good for each other. \n\nI'm with your family; this feels petty. I've been at weddings with my ex. You haven't spoken in five years, so just *keep not speaking to each other.* If he tries to talk, just move along and ignore that he's there.", "NTA.  Your brother should have known better (and apparently did, since he got you to agree first, then dropped it on you).  He manipulated you.", "Can you go to the ceremony and sit in the back and duck out before the reception? That way your brother will at least know you were there for his wedding, just not for the socializing part.", "NTA It is your choice to go on not to.

Nevertheless, your brother should side with you.\n\nYou know what? I suspect a set up. Ex is working on ypur brother to get you close to him.", "NTA. Your ex shouldn't have accepted the invitation, knowing it is your brother and you would be there. If your family is giving you a hard time over this, don't go to the wedding. Everyone has reasons to not be around certain people and you have yours.", "YTA\n\nIt would be one thing if your ex had been abusive. But you stated that isn't the case. In my mind, if you love your brother you will suck it up to be in the same room as the guy for one day.", "NAH. He invites whoever he wants and you have every right to refuse the invitation.

You say yourself that the relationship with your ex was only toxic. \nGrow up and get some mental boundaries.

You don't have to engage with your ex at all, you just have to be in the same room as him a few times. But also NTA because you're allowed to hold whatever boundaries feel right to you. I would consider, though, whether the consequences of holding those boundaries are going to be worth it in the end, because this will very likely change your familial relationships.", "> I know a lot of people will probably call me petty and immature\n\nWell!  Thanks for making this easy!  YTA\n\nYes, it's going to be tough, but nobody is asking you to be friendly or to socialize with him.  You just need to be cool, formal, and don't engage.", "ESH\n\nI would never invite the ex of a family member to any events that involve my family without asking them if they are ok with it before. I just think it's the respectful thing to do and I don't want to make my family uncomfortable on purpose. So your brother is the asshole for that.\n\nYour sister and mom are the asshole because their first reaction should be to ask to hear your side of the story and then try to mediate the situation between you and brother, not to put pressure on one side straight away.\n\nYou also kind of suck because it's your brother and you said that nothing severe happened between you and your ex. It there was abuse, cheating, violence, etc then NTA, but you said it wasn't the case.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand you being pissed at your brother and letting him know that. I also understand if you decide to back down from being a bridesmaid and make some reasonable demand. Like being at two different table and your brother telling your ex to not try to interact with you. But you definitively should attend as a guess, even if you decide that your relationship with your brother will suffer from this, or warn him that this might be the outcome if you and your ex are both invite to his marriage.", "It\u2019s so strange to me that your family would prioritize your ex husband being in the wedding over your comfort at your own brothers wedding.\n\nESH just go to the wedding even if you\u2019re just a guest\n\nNone of this petty non sense is worth missing your brothers wedding.", "NTA.

He shouldn't be choosing your ex over his own sister.", "You have some healing to do, and should get help with that right away.

Your refusal to \u201csuck it up\u201d is totally your call - but, lets be clear, if weddings were parties where everybody had to get along with everybody else in order to accept an invitation, it might be pretty hard to get the couple, two witnesses, and an officiant - let alone attendants and guests.  So that is a bit of an AH move - but ultimately it is your call.  So do what you want to do. Accommodations can be made to minimize putting people together that shouldn\u2019t be together.  It sounds like brother is trying to do that.  He just shouldn\u2019t have trapped you.  \n\nSummary: 1) Brother is an AH for cornering you into this situation. 2) You are an AH for not even trying to work out a scenario where you can honor your brother and avoid your ex. You had your wedding and made your decisions for it.  Brother is making his decisions. 3) Your family is a set of AH\u2019s for trying to force you to show up.\n\nI suggest that you probably should stay away from the wedding and just let the family gossip about you during the reception.  I fully expect that you will have many years of rancorous holiday family get-togethers and plenty of fights that will ensue.  Keep posting on Reddit - we will bring the popcorn.", "Yta", "NAH. I understand your brother but you can totally refuse the invite.\n\nPersonally I think your reasoning is immature. You broke up 7 years ago after no major betrayal or anything.

You've stated your feelings and you can plan something nice for that day for yourself.", "Gotta love that the people who crow \"blood is thicker than water\" are completely oblivious to the full quote \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\" which is the exact opposite of what they're trying to get across", "I think you have summed this up correctly, especially in the last paragraph.
