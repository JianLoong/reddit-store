They are planning on getting married next spring/early summer.  They have been working on putting their wedding party together and they did a video call with me (32F) a couple weeks ago to ask me to be a bridesmaid.  I of course agreed because I love them both and I am very happy for them.  \n\nHowever, during the call, and after I had already agreed to be a bridesmaid, my brother dropped a bomb on me.  He said that he hopes this doesn't cause any issues, but he wants to ask my ex-husband (30M) to be one of his groomsmen.  My initial reaction was not the best, I basically said \"What?  Why?  Are you serious? WTF?\"  \n\nFor some history, my ex and I were high school sweethearts and married young.  We were both 23 when we married and were divorced by the time we turned 25.  No infidelity or abu$e of any kind, just a toxic relationship we were too young to recognize properly and eventually we got to a point in our marriage where we just hated each other.  Thankfully, we never had kids and we were too young to have many assets, so the divorce was easy since neither of us wanted anything to do with the other.  I moved away, got a new job, and started a new life.  My ex stayed in our hometown (where my brother currently lives).  I haven't spoken to my ex in almost 5 years.  \n\nObviously, my brother has known my ex for a long time and they were always close.  Apparently, they remained close friends after the divorce even though my brother never mentioned it to me.  My brother told me that he understands this might be a bit awkward, but it's just for one day and it's not like my ex and I are going to have to walk down the aisle together.  He said they will try to do whatever they can to keep distance between us if needed, but that both me and my ex are very important people to him and he wants both of us involved in his wedding.  \n\nI know a lot of people will probably call me petty and immature, but I want nothing to do with my ex.  There's a reason I haven't spoken to him in so long, I have no desire to speak to him.  Let alone be in the same wedding party as him.  There's going to be a lot of wedding party activities that are going to involve being in close proximity to him for extended periods of time.  I want nothing to do with that.  \n\nI explained all of this to my brother and told him that if he's going to keep my ex as a groomsman, I don't think I can be a bridesmaid and I might have to reconsider even attending the wedding.  This led to a big of back and forth with my brother trying to bargain with me and convince me that it won't be that big of an issue, and me pretty much telling him this is non-negotiable for me.  \n\nSince that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.

And it's understandable to be upset that it feels like someone you loved didn't take your side; however, you need to have an honest conversation with your brother. You need to actually communicate that it hurts that he was just able to overlook everything that led to the end of your marriage and stay friends with your ex. \n\nYour feelings are not invalid, but if you love your brother and want to maintain a relationship with him, you need to talk with him about the real reason you're upset, and figure out a way to move forward.", "Or, your brother could support you by picking a different groomsman and explaining that: really sorry, bud, gotta support my sister on this one.

Your refusal to \u201csuck it up\u201d is totally your call - but, lets be clear, if weddings were parties where everybody had to get along with everybody else in order to accept an invitation, it might be pretty hard to get the couple, two witnesses, and an officiant - let alone attendants and guests.  So that is a bit of an AH move - but ultimately it is your call.  So do what you want to do. Accommodations can be made to minimize putting people together that shouldn\u2019t be together.

He just shouldn\u2019t have trapped you.  \n\nSummary: 1) Brother is an AH for cornering you into this situation. 2) You are an AH for not even trying to work out a scenario where you can honor your brother and avoid your ex. You had your wedding and made your decisions for it.

Why does this man still have so much power in your mind that your hatred still burns this hot?

You were within your right to decline being made a bridesmaid. However, you attending the wedding is not putting you in close proximity with your ex. If your relationship had no abuse and no infidelity and was just toxic due to maturity and incompatibility, then you attending as a guest to support your family despite who his friends are shouldn't be a debate. Unless your not being honest with yourself and the relationship with your ex, based on what you shared neither of you have any dealings that would necessitate any conversations and you both van avoid each other during the wedding.\n\nYour boundaries are your own and should not be forced on others. And your boundaries should be respected in return. But a boundary is just that. It's yours, no one else's.

And if they somehow think they can trick you, say ex won't be there, and you show up, you will turn around and walk away.  This is a choice your brother has, he can have you at the wedding or ex, but not both.   \n    \n>  Since that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.    \n    \nHonestly, with your brother, sister, and mom behaving like this, I would just respond with \"sorry, you have all been so disrespectful to me, I won't be attending no matter what now.  Thanks for the invite, I hope you have a wonderful wedding, but I won't be there.\"   \n    \nPlan yourself a nice vacation somewhere, enjoy yourself, and forget about the wedding.", "NTA.  Now that your fully informed of who makes up the wedding party, you are no longer interested.  And an invite is just that, an invite.  You are under NO obligation to attend.  Your brother can be friends with whomever he wants, and you can spend his wedding day doing what makes you happy.  You are NOT petty or immature.  I'm 56 and don't go places where I know people I don't care for will be.", "This makes me wonder if your brother had come clean about being friends with your ex earlier, like YEARS earlier, maybe it wouldn't have been such a shock to you about the wedding. Because a big part of the response seems to be shock. \n\nI'm ticked off for you that your other sister and mom are insulting you in an effort to convince you to cave. That seems so manipulative. \n\nI don't know how long you've been thinking about it, OP. If your desire to avoid your ex outweighs your desire to attend your brother's wedding, then don't go. But if you think you can muster thicker skin by the wedding, and want to be there, go. \n\nI'm going with NTA. Because I'm pretty sure if I ever get divorced from someone, I wouldn't want to see them again if I could avoid it. I have some friends who lament that they have to deal with their exes in custody transfers and things like that. They wish they were free of their exes, altogether.", "Why don\u2019t you just go as a guest and ignore him at the wedding? Just don\u2019t be in the wedding party with him.", "Nope.  You don\u2019t have to \u201cget over it\u201d.   And anyone who tells you to should be told to go pound sand.  You didn\u2019t make a scene, you didn\u2019t yell at him, you didn\u2019t go running to family and friends saying how unfair and mean they are being.   You simply told him that you have no desire to be in the presence of your ex and that you wish your brother and his bride well.   to your mother and sister, I would also be temped to say: \u201cthank you SO very much for having my back and supporting me.   I can\u2019t tell you how much love I feel from you right now.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nI think if you don't want to be IN a wedding with your ex, totally fine to decline. \n\nAnd I also understand your reaction to saying you might not go at all initially, because you were shocked to find out they were even friends/close enough to be in the wedding. This was all new information for you, so I can understand your reaction. \n\nAnd honestly, I'd be pissed too. For 5 years they have been friends- close enough to be in his wedding- and NO ONE mentioned that? With anything like this, sometimes the thing that hurts the most is feeling like family/friends lied to you or kept things from you, and kind of agreed to do so. Maybe if your brother had dropped a nugget or two over the years of him seeing your ex, this would be a different story. \n\nYour mom and sister are definitely AH's for just telling you to grow up. Did they know about this friendship and also purposefully never told you? Why would they do that if the didn't think it was a \"big deal\" that would hurt your feelings. So now you need to get over something that everyone thought you were too sensitive to know about for the last 5 years. THAT would be a dealbreaker for me. \n\nYour family, and probably lots of comments, are going to focus on \"it's your ex, get over it\" but this isn't about being in a room with your ex (which of course you may not want to be either) but about family keeping your ex in their lives and purposefully keeping that from you and now wanting you to be okay with it.", "You are allowed to choose whether or not you go.

Perhaps he did too? \n\nI would also assume there are other things you\u2019re not sharing here that makes this an issue for you. In that case maybe not such a huge asshole, but maybe a teeny-weeny one? \n\nIf you maintain your position it\u2019s up to your brother to choose. \n\nI would go and see my ex.

Your brother can have whoever he wants as a groomsman and you can decide not to be a part of it. You said there was no abuse or infidelity so I'm not sure why you are so against it but the reason is not my business. Just be prepared to no longer have a good relationship with him if you decide not to attend. Since you didn't give any good reason why you can't suck it up for one day, you are coming off as immature and petty and I'm sure your brother is hurt by it.

Your brother has the right to have your ex as his groomsman and you have the right to not go to the wedding. What people don't understand is that even though it has been 5 years since you divorced, a situation like a wedding can bring up a lot of old, painful memories that you may not want to experience. You are put in an untenable situation. If you go, you will be miserable. If you don't, you have to face bad feelings from your family but you have to do what is best for you. And you are the only one who knows that.", "Putting your brother in the position of having to choose between two people he cares about equally just because you're hung up on a relationship that went south mutually (meaning your ex didn't do anything like cheat or abuse you) to the degree that even being in the same room with the guy is beyond your ability to handle is, yes, an asshole move. Especially you saying you may not even attend the wedding if your ex is there.\n\nThe message your sending to everyone (other than the one that's already been pointed out: that you're immature), whether you realize it or not, is that you aren't over your ex and that you will allow his presence to control your choices.

If you can't be civil to your ex, then just stay away from him.", "YTA. You do need to be more mature, his wedding is about him, not you, so you don't get to dictate who he chooses as his groomsmen. It would also be shitty to not show up for him, since that would be putting him in a \"him or me\" situation. Trust me, a wedding is stressful as it is and this would make it even harder. \n\nThis is something that can be easily fixed with a conversation, negociating what events you'd like to attend and maybe choosing \"non-essential\" ones that either you or your ex can mix, so you keep contact at a minimum. This discussion could also be about fixing the sitting problem so you can keep your distances. \n\nTalk it out, and go to your brother's wedding.

I get that you don\u2019t like the guy but there was no abuse or cheating and it\u2019s been 5 years. It just kinda paints you as an unreasonably bitter ex.

Your brother understands this is a tricky situation and he's willing to make arrangements to keep you apart as much as possible. And your ex wasn't abusive to you.

Who gives a crap about the ex you haven't seen in 5 years?  Just be civil and enjoy the day.  I think you would regret not being there for your brother and SIL.

I get dropping out of the bridal party for all the reasons you stated.", "YTA you would make this a big deal when you yourself said it was a relationship you both grew out of.  No one said you had to get back together or speak more than hi and bye.  This is your HS attitude on full alert.  Grow up and be an adult.  HS was years ago and cutting someone out of everyone\u2019s life because OP doesn\u2019t want contact is childish.  This is something you grow out of as you become an adult.  Not having contact because you moved on and away it\u2019s all well and good but to expect everyone else to cut this person out because you are no longer together is what\u2019s wrong with this situation.  I bet the reason the relationship didn\u2019t work out is because OP never matured like her ex and is still stuck as a perpetual teen with all those misconceptions.  So your making your brother choose, don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t win.

Please answer why the brother has never mentioned the ex being a continued part of his life until AFTER getting agreement that she would be a bridesmaid. The brother knew exactly what he was doing, very underhanded.\n\nNTA from me.

I feel like it's one thing to remain friends with people who just don't get along with each other, and quite another to suddenly drop \"oh by the way, I have remained friends with your EX SPOUSE all these years\" when it was apparently genuinely hidden. My breakups weren't even the most contentious but if my sister suddenly told me that she'd been friends with someone I dated many years ago and never told me, AND I would need to see them at a stressful social event in order to support her, I'm not exactly sure what I would do.

There wasn't a \"by the way, I'm still friends with your ex but I don't have to bring him up to you if you don't want\" conversation that happened at some point over the years, which would be reasonable.

If she can suck it up for a few hours then great, but it's understandable and not at all uncommon that she might not be able to. The brother isn't wrong for inviting or involving the ex necessarily but he does have to accept that under the circumstances he may have to choose between them.

Idk it must be a cultural difference cos I really don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong\n\nEdit: spelling", "People have weirdly strong opinions about people they\u2019ve never met. \n\nOP is a human being asking Reddit for their opinions and unfortunately people are ruthless. \n\nI hope she works it all out and makes a decision that she can be happy with.", "I feel like some of this is that OP and Ex- have been divorced for how long and Brother never mentioned, even randomly, that he still hung out with Ex-.\n\nIt feels intentional. Brother knew that OP wasn't a fan of Ex- so he kept it under wraps that he was friends with him, until the wedding when he wanted both of them in the wedding.\n\nHe should have started mentioning that he still hung out with Ex- 6 months to a year ago so this wouldn't be a surprise. Cuz it feels like that is more than half the issue.\n\nNot that Ex- is in the wedding party. Not that Ex- will be at the wedding. But that this entire time, her brother was hiding that he and Ex- were really close friends. (Not just friends, but such close friends that Ex- is part of the wedding party.)", "And can I just add, remember that the ex-husband was put in the exact same situation as OP. He knew that his ex-wife was gonna be there given that she\u2019s the groom\u2019s sister. I mean, did everyone really think this was gonna be a walk in the park for him? But he chose to come AND be part of the groom\u2019s party. From the perspective of the brother, wouldn\u2019t it appear that his friend is more supportive of him than his own sister?\n\nGiven that the brother has offered a setup where OP and her ex can have as little interaction as possible AND an option to simply attend as a guest, I say OP can suck it up and support her brother.", "Exactly.\n\nI think the sister and mom here are right, OP needs to grow up. If there was abuse or cheating, that'd be another story, but there wasn't. (unless there is more to the story we're not being told)\n\nOP's brother is even offering to limit her contact with the ex if she's a bridesmaid. \n\nOP's response is that she won't go to the wedding.\n\nOP is the AH.", "Exactly. OP says she moved on with her life, but if you can\u2019t stand to be at the same event as someone else after 7 years apart, and there wasn\u2019t any abuse/cheating involved, then you haven\u2019t really move on.", "She should be there for her brother and start to heal those wounds, who cares if her ex is going to be there.  She said the relationship was toxic, but unless there was some type of abuse or something she is not disclosing, I don't see the issue.  She can choose to not talk to him, and she can tell her brother to tell her ex not to try.\n\nShe doesn't have to be in the wedding or go if she doesn't want too.  It is her choice, I just think if her ex and her can be adults at the wedding, it won't be a problem.  Just my opinion, but don't let your past destroy your relationships in the present and future.", "Agree \ud83d\udcaf", "Her \"FEELINGS\" are still in high school! Her ex still has cooties. She needs to grow up.", "She is willing to sacrifice her relationship with her brother over a ex who she chose to be with at one time, who she admits is a good person, just one she doesn't wanna be around.  She needs to hope on the maturity train and take a couple of laps.", "Very well said! Get over yourself, OP and celebrate with your brother. It\u2019s not like you will have to sit next to him or hold his hand. YTA.", "Agree with you. Spot on!From the OP there was no abuse, no cheating, just from the description that it was a toxic marriage where they both fell out of loved and didn't like each other any more.Nobody likes seeing exes, really, but this person is a close friend of her sibling. Don't make him choose. It's selfish and spoiling his day.Surely after 5 years they can be civil, especially if nothing bad actually occurred in their marriage.\n\nEdit: Just seen also that sibling was friends before there were together, always close, and she ghosted her family for some time after the breakup. Bottom line is the brother values them both and wants them included in the special day.", "OP said it was a toxic relationship. OP didn't go into details, but hate is a pretty strong emotion and doesn't in any way imply that they divorced just because. Boundaries come up a lot on AITA and are usually encouraged. I'm not sure why this would/should be any different than any other person posting about a boundary set because of a toxic relationship. OP is NTA.", "It sounds like she's not being very emotionally mature...\n\nI have an ex wife and I get along with her great!  We have a son and make sure that we are cordial and do the right things for him.\n\n5 years is an insane amount of time to hold onto feelings this strong!  Especially when there was no cheating or other bad reasons for a divorce.  No kids either... All she has to do is stand near this guy for one day and she can't even do that after 5 years of separation??  Crazy!", "> he understands this might be a bit awkward, but it's just for one day and it's not like my ex and I are going to have to walk down the aisle together. He said they will try to do whatever they can to keep distance between us if needed,\n\nDoes this even sound like a good idea in the first place? It sounds to me like the brother is setting up the most awkward situation he possibly can, on his own, and he knows it. Who would want to go to a wedding where the wedding party has to keep distance and avoid each other?? This whole idea is dumb.", "It\u2019s a small town that the brother and ex live in and have to continue to see each other in.

It would be easy enough to decline a role in the wedding party, show up at the wedding and focus on the bride and groom then leave. It may take some fortitude but it is a gift to give her brother. \n\nYTA for the ultimatum but not for your feelings about your x", "Technically she married her brothers friend. Its not like her brother befriended her husband after they got together.", "Sounds like she left town and ghosted everyone, why wouldn't she think they were friends, they were friends before they were married and during the marriage.  Why does she thing that over a decade of friendship would just end when her marriage did.  I stayed friends with my ex-wife's father for over a decade up to his death.  I never spoke to my Ex after the divorce was final.  My ex's father met my new wife and children and even we visited him in another country, where he was working.  Still never a word to my ex, not that I would care, but I have no issues talking to her.", "I mean if my family decided my toxic ex was more important to them than me, yeah I wouldn't attend at all either.  Why bother.", "To be fair to OP, she said the relationship and breakup was toxic. You don't need cheating or physical abuse for things to be so bad that you don't want to see the person or have any reminders about them. I'm not going to fault her if seeing him would bring a lot of bad memories back for her and she can't handle it. Good for her ex if it doesn't bother him, and good for you or anyone else who had amicable breakups, but that doesn't sound like the case for OP.\n\nI can't render a judgement because I need more info--like why she went a year with no contact with her family, etc. Her brother has a right to ask whomever he wants to be in the wedding  party, and OP has every right to decide to not be in the wedding party and not go to the wedding when the person she was in a toxic relationship with will be there. \n\nHer brother can accept her decision and tell her that he'll miss her but that he understands. Her family can disagree with her decision but should accept it and not be going off on her.  They don't have to like her decision or agree with it, but they should respect it. If she's doing this to try and force him to drop her ex, it will show her that it won't work. If she is being genuine in saying she cannot deal with being in the same room with her ex, then she is doing what's best for herself and frankly everyone who will be at that wedding.\n\nForcing someone to come to a place where they won't be comfortable is a recipe for disaster.", "Well, I am not convincing you or anyone.\nAlso, people shouldn't convince OP just because, she chose to avoid what is painful to her. \n\nPsychologically speaking, she is not AH. Accusing her wrongly is AH. \nThis post is an eye-opener for people like me because I can see mental health awareness is so limited.", "Where did he say that? From what I read, he said that he wants both of them at the wedding and that they would do whatever they needed to make it comfortable for OP?", "Alternatively, he was respecting her boundaries by not bringing up the ex in conversation.  We don't need to jump to conclusions of malice when there are perfectly reasonable explanations.", "According to OP, brother and ex have been close friends since grade school. OP married Ex when she was 23; Brother and Ex had already been close friends for over a decade at that point. \n\nPost divorce, OP ghosted the family for almost a year, according to *her.* I don't understand why she'd think they'd *stopped* being friends.", "Why would you mention to your divorced sibling that you\u2019re still talking to their ex? What is the point lol?", "I do agree that the way he brought it up is an issue, but this take almost implies that OP is valid in threatening not to be a bridesmaid or even attend *as punishment for her brother* not cluing her in earlier to their still close friendship moreso than (what I would call \"valid\") feelings of discomfort.\n\nYes, he could have brought it up in a better way now, but it honestly sounds respectful to me that he kept their relationships separate. According to comments from OP, brother and ex have been besties since they were children and she ghosted the family for a year after her divorce. It totally makes sense to me that he would have maintained the friendship (what, was he supposed to ghost a life-long friend for the sake of a sister who was no-contact?) and not bothered her with the info once she came back into his life again.", ">And can I just add, remember that the ex-husband was put in the exact same situation as OP. \n\nOr maybe he's a narcissist and wasn't put in the same situation, because he'll actually enjoy watching her squirm. We have no idea.", "Yeah being that OP described their marriage as toxic, there\u2019s no chance that ex-husband might just enjoy sticking it to his ex-wife by being at the wedding and making her uncomfortable, right?  He could have reached out too, and found out how she\u2019d feel about him being there. But he didn\u2019t, he just let her get blindsided by the information.", "Since you don\u2019t know what was so bad to cause her to not want to be around him, how can you say they are right?", "If there was any abuse, it is on her end. Because she clearly would have disclosed that information. She already knows how she looks for a disliking her ex for basically no reason.", "Because boundaries are things we set for ourselves; we can't dictate boundaries on someone else's relationship. \"I wont' be friends with my ex\" is a boundary.  \"You can't be friends with my ex.\" is not. OP *can* decide that one of her boundaries is that she refuses to even be in the same room as her ex, but that kind of boundary will absolutely have an impact on her other relationships. \n\nIf one of your boundaries creates a situation where you're making someone choose between you and someone that they've been close friends with since they were in grade school, then you need to consider if your boundary is reasonable and are you willing to potentially lose your relationship with that person.", "Yeah, that\u2019s great, but not everyone is you.  \n\nThe OP is allowed to process her pain for how ever long it takes her.  She sure as h shouldn\u2019t have to deal with her ex being sprung on her at a family event(s) after not even knowing he stayed in close contact with her brother. Who would want to spend time and money  traveling to a family wedding (and all the lead up) to come face-to face and interact with a person who caused you pain and who you thought was out of your life? Even though she stated there was no abuse, divorce can be incredibly painful and leave scars and if that\u2019s her truth her family should respect it.", "Crucial difference here is that you and your ex wife get along *great!*  OP and her ex hate each other.  You don't get to decide for other people what is appropriate for them to feel just because you have a different experience.", "Your inability to recognize the feelings and experiences of other people is emotionally immature.", "My ex and I were both in a wedding, him doing music me doing the, smack in the middle of our divorce. Somehow we both managed to be civil and drop drama for two days for a couple that was our mutual friends, not even family. And we were married 6, together 9, lol. Not this married 2 years divorced over 5 years ago waaaah. Some people need to grow up and realize the world doesn't need to cater to them and their feelings 1000% of the time. That they are, in fact, not the main character, and can suck it up for a day.", "It doesn't matter because it's his wedding and he can invite who he chooses. She doesn't have to attend of course, but I promise you she is the one who is going to be seen as the immature one if she does that.", "What? This isn't waiting until the last minute. The wedding is happening next year.", "\\>  It's funny how he didn't tell her about said friendship, though. Obviously, he knew how frayed the relationship was.\n\nProbably because OP is the kind of person to get this angry at the thought of spending one day near her ex lmao.\n\nCan imagine the brother has tried to tell her about this friendship but just thought it wasn't worth the drama.  Who holds onto feelings this strong for 5 years??  Madness!", "This is the comment from OP \n\n\u201cso maybe your brother could consider who's most important to him at his wedding.\u201d\n\nI brought up something similar when my brother and I were talking, well kind of arguing, about this.  He said that he's known my ex since they were in grade school, played sports together for years, still play softball and golf together, etc.  He said that after I moved away and pretty much cut contact with everyone from our hometown, my ex was more like a brother to him than I was a sister.  He told me that if I put him in a position where he has to choose one of us over the other, that I shouldn't be surprised if I don't win.\n\nThat's part of what my sister and mom were fighting with me about too, that I'm being an AH for putting my brother in a position where he has to choose one of us because I can't be bothered to \"act like an adult\" for one day instead of running from my problems (my mom's words.)  My mom pretty much told me that if I don't attend, then I shouldn't be surprised if there are lasting consequences in the family.\n\nWhen I told her that I can't believe they are all supporting my ex over me on this, my mom said that they are supporting my brother, not my ex.  But she did say that at least my ex is being an adult and is willing to put the past behind him to support someone he cares about (my brother).  So she had to get one final jab in at me which felt great.  /s.", "Fair; the dates are fuzzy, but OP specifically said that brother and Ex \"were always close,\" which seemed to suggest (to me) that their friendship predated OP dating Ex.", "It says in the comment that they were close friends from young and OP also did another comment about how they were friends from grade school and on teams together etc their whole lives", "We've stayed friendly with two spouses when they have had a difficult divorce.    \n\n\nIf I divorced my spouse and my sibling had been friends with them since they were little kids, long long before we got married or became close, I wouldn't expect them to drop their friend, especially if the marriage ended without abuse or cheating.", "I mean they were probably friends because of OP.  They stated dating in HS so she was probably 18 or younger and brother was 15 or younger.\n\nBrother and ex then had 7+ years during formative years of brothers life to build a relationship before OPs divorce where OP admitted they had a close relationship.

However to pretend that what she did is giving him an ultimatum is just being disingenuous. \"If he's going to keep my ex as a groomsman, I don't think I can be a bridesmaid and might even have to reconsider attending the wedding\", those were her exact words. If you don't believe that to be her giving him an ultimatum idk what to tell you. Shit like that is really manipulative.", "It was in the comments", "Where does it say Op ghosted her family?  I don't see that in OP's post.  I DO see where she says she and her ex were toxic and *hated* each other.

Or they were *both* toxic to one another.\n\nAnd what do you mean blindsided? Are they getting married tomorrow? Did I miss that part? Because I read they\u2019re getting married *spring or early summer next year* which means he\u2019s actually letting her know *almost a year in advance*.
