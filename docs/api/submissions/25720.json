They are planning on getting married next spring/early summer.  They have been working on putting their wedding party together and they did a video call with me (32F) a couple weeks ago to ask me to be a bridesmaid.  I of course agreed because I love them both and I am very happy for them.  \n\nHowever, during the call, and after I had already agreed to be a bridesmaid, my brother dropped a bomb on me.  He said that he hopes this doesn't cause any issues, but he wants to ask my ex-husband (30M) to be one of his groomsmen.  My initial reaction was not the best, I basically said \"What?  Why?  Are you serious? WTF?\"  \n\nFor some history, my ex and I were high school sweethearts and married young.  We were both 23 when we married and were divorced by the time we turned 25.  No infidelity or abu$e of any kind, just a toxic relationship we were too young to recognize properly and eventually we got to a point in our marriage where we just hated each other.  Thankfully, we never had kids and we were too young to have many assets, so the divorce was easy since neither of us wanted anything to do with the other.  I moved away, got a new job, and started a new life.  My ex stayed in our hometown (where my brother currently lives).  I haven't spoken to my ex in almost 5 years.  \n\nObviously, my brother has known my ex for a long time and they were always close.  Apparently, they remained close friends after the divorce even though my brother never mentioned it to me.  My brother told me that he understands this might be a bit awkward, but it's just for one day and it's not like my ex and I are going to have to walk down the aisle together.  He said they will try to do whatever they can to keep distance between us if needed, but that both me and my ex are very important people to him and he wants both of us involved in his wedding.  \n\nI know a lot of people will probably call me petty and immature, but I want nothing to do with my ex.  There's a reason I haven't spoken to him in so long, I have no desire to speak to him.  Let alone be in the same wedding party as him.  There's going to be a lot of wedding party activities that are going to involve being in close proximity to him for extended periods of time.  I want nothing to do with that.  \n\nI explained all of this to my brother and told him that if he's going to keep my ex as a groomsman, I don't think I can be a bridesmaid and I might have to reconsider even attending the wedding.  This led to a big of back and forth with my brother trying to bargain with me and convince me that it won't be that big of an issue, and me pretty much telling him this is non-negotiable for me.  \n\nSince that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.

Clearly your ex is an important person to him as are you. \n\nIf him being present at the wedding disturbs you that much, there\u2019s clearly something you aren\u2019t saying here and need to privately discuss with your brother. Otherwise you\u2019re holding a grudge and that gets you nowhere", "NTA \n\nYour brother is entitled to invite whomever he wants to his wedding, he is also allowed to ask whoever he wants to be part of his wedding party, he does not have to change his mind if he doesn\u2019t want too.\n\nHOWEVER, an invite isn\u2019t a summons.

And it's understandable to be upset that it feels like someone you loved didn't take your side; however, you need to have an honest conversation with your brother. You need to actually communicate that it hurts that he was just able to overlook everything that led to the end of your marriage and stay friends with your ex. \n\nYour feelings are not invalid, but if you love your brother and want to maintain a relationship with him, you need to talk with him about the real reason you're upset, and figure out a way to move forward.", "Or, your brother could support you by picking a different groomsman and explaining that: really sorry, bud, gotta support my sister on this one.

There wasn't any abuse or cheating, just two people who weren't good for each other. \n\nI'm with your family; this feels petty. I've been at weddings with my ex.

You don't have to engage with your ex at all, you just have to be in the same room as him a few times. But also NTA because you're allowed to hold whatever boundaries feel right to you.

I just think it's the respectful thing to do and I don't want to make my family uncomfortable on purpose.

It there was abuse, cheating, violence, etc then NTA, but you said it wasn't the case.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand you being pissed at your brother and letting him know that. I also understand if you decide to back down from being a bridesmaid and make some reasonable demand.

Your refusal to \u201csuck it up\u201d is totally your call - but, lets be clear, if weddings were parties where everybody had to get along with everybody else in order to accept an invitation, it might be pretty hard to get the couple, two witnesses, and an officiant - let alone attendants and guests.  So that is a bit of an AH move - but ultimately it is your call.  So do what you want to do. Accommodations can be made to minimize putting people together that shouldn\u2019t be together.  It sounds like brother is trying to do that.  He just shouldn\u2019t have trapped you.  \n\nSummary: 1) Brother is an AH for cornering you into this situation. 2) You are an AH for not even trying to work out a scenario where you can honor your brother and avoid your ex. You had your wedding and made your decisions for it.  Brother is making his decisions. 3) Your family is a set of AH\u2019s for trying to force you to show up.\n\nI suggest that you probably should stay away from the wedding and just let the family gossip about you during the reception.

You've stated your feelings and you can plan something nice for that day for yourself.", "Gotta love that the people who crow \"blood is thicker than water\" are completely oblivious to the full quote \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\" which is the exact opposite of what they're trying to get across\n\n\nEDIT: I was wrong about it being the \"original\" quote, but I believe the concept is still valid.", "I think you have summed this up correctly, especially in the last paragraph.

Why does this man still have so much power in your mind that your hatred still burns this hot? Why are you holding onto that?\n\nFrankly, if he's still able to create this strong a response just from the idea that you might have to interact with him, it's better that you don't go, because with that much hatred burning within you, you're guaranteed to make a scene.", "NAH\n\nBrother can ask whomever he pleases to be part of his wedding party.\n\nOP can choose not to go if it makes her uncomfortable.\n\nDo whatever is best for you.

I think it\u2019s better that you don\u2019t go if you feel that strongly about it.\n\nFor all we know your ex probably has not  thought too deep or at all about you being at the wedding and isn\u2019t fussing about this.", "NTA, and all the Y's are a bit surprising to be honest.  \nThe fact that your brother waited until after you agreed to be a bridesmaid to tell you about your ex's role in the wedding speaks volumes.

It's a train wreck waiting to happen.  \nBest case, and I see this as a slim chance best case, the wedding goes off without a hitch and only a handful of people see the cool aloofness of 2 people in the party.  \nAnd with lots of wedding activities, that just adds to the chance of fallout.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother doesn't support you, so why should you support him?", "If the divorce was easy, and you guys moved on\u2026 what\u2019s exactly stopping you from ignoring him for one day?

You're not required to attend anyone's wedding but you would be incredibly selfish and self centered to have initially agreed only to back out of the wedding party and the wedding because of this. \n\nYOUR BROTHER'S WEDDING IS NOT ABOUT YOU. By acting like this you're behaving like a child who believes the world should revolve around them. This is equivalent to demanding he not serve carrots as a side dish just cause you don't like carrots even if you won't have to eat them and your brother is going to take the extra step to make sure they're not even on your plate. \n\nYou're not expected to interact with him in any way, and based on this response I think it's obvious why your brother didn't mention them being friends to you before.", "YTA for refusing to go to the wedding at all. You were within your right to decline being made a bridesmaid. However, you attending the wedding is not putting you in close proximity with your ex. If your relationship had no abuse and no infidelity and was just toxic due to maturity and incompatibility, then you attending as a guest to support your family despite who his friends are shouldn't be a debate. Unless your not being honest with yourself and the relationship with your ex, based on what you shared neither of you have any dealings that would necessitate any conversations and you both van avoid each other during the wedding.\n\nYour boundaries are your own and should not be forced on others. And your boundaries should be respected in return. But a boundary is just that. It's yours, no one else's. If you try to force your brother to choose between a friend and you, it stops being a boundary and becomes a control tactic. Just keep that in mind as you continue to navigate this with your family. \n\nGood luck.", ">  I know a lot of people will probably call me petty and immature, but I want nothing to do with my ex.  \n    \nNTA, that is not petty and immature, that is the reality of life, when someone hurts you badly, you want nothing to do with them.     \n     \nStick to your guns, tell your family that they know where you stand, and you will not attend a wedding, or any other event, where ex is.  And if they somehow think they can trick you, say ex won't be there, and you show up, you will turn around and walk away.  This is a choice your brother has, he can have you at the wedding or ex, but not both.   \n    \n>  Since that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.    \n    \nHonestly, with your brother, sister, and mom behaving like this, I would just respond with \"sorry, you have all been so disrespectful to me, I won't be attending no matter what now.  Thanks for the invite, I hope you have a wonderful wedding, but I won't be there.\"   \n    \nPlan yourself a nice vacation somewhere, enjoy yourself, and forget about the wedding.", "NTA.  Now that your fully informed of who makes up the wedding party, you are no longer interested.  And an invite is just that, an invite.  You are under NO obligation to attend.

I'm 56 and don't go places where I know people I don't care for will be.", "This makes me wonder if your brother had come clean about being friends with your ex earlier, like YEARS earlier, maybe it wouldn't have been such a shock to you about the wedding. Because a big part of the response seems to be shock. \n\nI'm ticked off for you that your other sister and mom are insulting you in an effort to convince you to cave. That seems so manipulative. \n\nI don't know how long you've been thinking about it, OP. If your desire to avoid your ex outweighs your desire to attend your brother's wedding, then don't go. But if you think you can muster thicker skin by the wedding, and want to be there, go. \n\nI'm going with NTA. Because I'm pretty sure if I ever get divorced from someone, I wouldn't want to see them again if I could avoid it. I have some friends who lament that they have to deal with their exes in custody transfers and things like that. They wish they were free of their exes, altogether.", "Why don\u2019t you just go as a guest and ignore him at the wedding? Just don\u2019t be in the wedding party with him.", "Nope.  You don\u2019t have to \u201cget over it\u201d.   And anyone who tells you to should be told to go pound sand.  You didn\u2019t make a scene, you didn\u2019t yell at him, you didn\u2019t go running to family and friends saying how unfair and mean they are being.   You simply told him that you have no desire to be in the presence of your ex and that you wish your brother and his bride well.   to your mother and sister, I would also be temped to say: \u201cthank you SO very much for having my back and supporting me.   I can\u2019t tell you how much love I feel from you right now.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nI think if you don't want to be IN a wedding with your ex, totally fine to decline. \n\nAnd I also understand your reaction to saying you might not go at all initially, because you were shocked to find out they were even friends/close enough to be in the wedding. This was all new information for you, so I can understand your reaction. \n\nAnd honestly, I'd be pissed too. For 5 years they have been friends- close enough to be in his wedding- and NO ONE mentioned that? With anything like this, sometimes the thing that hurts the most is feeling like family/friends lied to you or kept things from you, and kind of agreed to do so. Maybe if your brother had dropped a nugget or two over the years of him seeing your ex, this would be a different story. \n\nYour mom and sister are definitely AH's for just telling you to grow up. Did they know about this friendship and also purposefully never told you? Why would they do that if the didn't think it was a \"big deal\" that would hurt your feelings. So now you need to get over something that everyone thought you were too sensitive to know about for the last 5 years. THAT would be a dealbreaker for me. \n\nYour family, and probably lots of comments, are going to focus on \"it's your ex, get over it\" but this isn't about being in a room with your ex (which of course you may not want to be either) but about family keeping your ex in their lives and purposefully keeping that from you and now wanting you to be okay with it.", "You are allowed to choose whether or not you go.

Perhaps he did too? \n\nI would also assume there are other things you\u2019re not sharing here that makes this an issue for you. In that case maybe not such a huge asshole, but maybe a teeny-weeny one? \n\nIf you maintain your position it\u2019s up to your brother to choose. \n\nI would go and see my ex.

Your brother can have whoever he wants as a groomsman and you can decide not to be a part of it. You said there was no abuse or infidelity so I'm not sure why you are so against it but the reason is not my business. Just be prepared to no longer have a good relationship with him if you decide not to attend. Since you didn't give any good reason why you can't suck it up for one day, you are coming off as immature and petty and I'm sure your brother is hurt by it.

Your brother has the right to have your ex as his groomsman and you have the right to not go to the wedding. What people don't understand is that even though it has been 5 years since you divorced, a situation like a wedding can bring up a lot of old, painful memories that you may not want to experience. You are put in an untenable situation. If you go, you will be miserable. If you don't, you have to face bad feelings from your family but you have to do what is best for you. And you are the only one who knows that.", "Putting your brother in the position of having to choose between two people he cares about equally just because you're hung up on a relationship that went south mutually (meaning your ex didn't do anything like cheat or abuse you) to the degree that even being in the same room with the guy is beyond your ability to handle is, yes, an asshole move. Especially you saying you may not even attend the wedding if your ex is there.\n\nThe message your sending to everyone (other than the one that's already been pointed out: that you're immature), whether you realize it or not, is that you aren't over your ex and that you will allow his presence to control your choices.

If you can't be civil to your ex, then just stay away from him.", "YTA. You do need to be more mature, his wedding is about him, not you, so you don't get to dictate who he chooses as his groomsmen. It would also be shitty to not show up for him, since that would be putting him in a \"him or me\" situation. Trust me, a wedding is stressful as it is and this would make it even harder. \n\nThis is something that can be easily fixed with a conversation, negociating what events you'd like to attend and maybe choosing \"non-essential\" ones that either you or your ex can mix, so you keep contact at a minimum. This discussion could also be about fixing the sitting problem so you can keep your distances. \n\nTalk it out, and go to your brother's wedding.

I get that you don\u2019t like the guy but there was no abuse or cheating and it\u2019s been 5 years. It just kinda paints you as an unreasonably bitter ex.

Your brother understands this is a tricky situation and he's willing to make arrangements to keep you apart as much as possible. And your ex wasn't abusive to you.

Who gives a crap about the ex you haven't seen in 5 years?  Just be civil and enjoy the day.  I think you would regret not being there for your brother and SIL.

I get dropping out of the bridal party for all the reasons you stated.", "YTA you would make this a big deal when you yourself said it was a relationship you both grew out of.  No one said you had to get back together or speak more than hi and bye.  This is your HS attitude on full alert.  Grow up and be an adult.  HS was years ago and cutting someone out of everyone\u2019s life because OP doesn\u2019t want contact is childish.  This is something you grow out of as you become an adult.  Not having contact because you moved on and away it\u2019s all well and good but to expect everyone else to cut this person out because you are no longer together is what\u2019s wrong with this situation.  I bet the reason the relationship didn\u2019t work out is because OP never matured like her ex and is still stuck as a perpetual teen with all those misconceptions.  So your making your brother choose, don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t win.

I thought you had moved on, if that\u2019s true then why do you care?", "For all those who think that OP is TA... Please answer why the brother has never mentioned the ex being a continued part of his life until AFTER getting agreement that she would be a bridesmaid. The brother knew exactly what he was doing, very underhanded.\n\nNTA from me.

I feel like it's one thing to remain friends with people who just don't get along with each other, and quite another to suddenly drop \"oh by the way, I have remained friends with your EX SPOUSE all these years\" when it was apparently genuinely hidden. My breakups weren't even the most contentious but if my sister suddenly told me that she'd been friends with someone I dated many years ago and never told me, AND I would need to see them at a stressful social event in order to support her, I'm not exactly sure what I would do.

There wasn't a \"by the way, I'm still friends with your ex but I don't have to bring him up to you if you don't want\" conversation that happened at some point over the years, which would be reasonable. It was literally just dropped on her when she's expected to be part of the same wedding party. Would you really be cool with that? I feel like I wouldn't be.

If she can suck it up for a few hours then great, but it's understandable and not at all uncommon that she might not be able to. The brother isn't wrong for inviting or involving the ex necessarily but he does have to accept that under the circumstances he may have to choose between them.

None of my business, but if he abused you in anyway mentally or physically, cheated on you, then I can see your dilemma:  You can't tell your brother this or anything personal between your ex and yourself.  If your ex was a decent person though, you may want to reconsider.", "I gotta go with ESH. I get where you're coming from, I really do. And I feel like I'd be a lot more leaning towards NTA if you were considering just not being a bridesmaid, but to skip your brother's wedding all together because you don't want to see an ex who, by your own admission, wasn't abusive or anything of the sort that was entirely one-sided on him? That feels like a lot especially for someone you haven't spoken to in 5 years.  \n\n\nBy taking it to the extent of threatening, and that's what I truly believe you were doing whether you realize it or not, to not go at all you've basically put your brother in a position to choose who he wants at his own wedding. All over someone that you view as a good person??? You basically offered nothing in the form of a compromise to find a workaround that satisfied both of you. Neither did he, which is his failing, and he should've approached this with more consideration of your past.  \n\n\nBut damn, they literally have MORE history together than you do with the ex.", "From the sound of it you and your ex weren't good for each other. It wasn't a good match. But he didn't wrong you. No cheating, no abuse, just. Not the right fit. It's fine for you to not want him in your life anymore, and he doesn't have to be in any important, personal, and lasting way.\n\n\nThe thing is though, this isnt about you. This is your brother's wedding and the people important to *him*. Unless you truely also have a bad relationship with your brother then the love and support you show toward your brother should trump petty hatred toward your ex, no? \n\n\nEven if you do wedding party activities that ex is a part of you have the ability to keep your distance and not speak to him. You could ask your brother to help you out in this department as well. If he's unable to accommodate and help you keep minimal contact with ex, then by all means decline being involved. But you should still support you brother and be there for him on this big step in his life. \n\n\nYTA if you let this stop you from *going*. But understandable if you aren't comfortable being a part of the wedding party", "I don't think it's unreasonable for mom to call and tell her daughter that not coming to her brother's wedding at all because you don't like his guest list is out of line. Seems like literally exactly mom's job.", "Yeah it\u2019s just a big middle finger to her brother.\n\nClearly a relationship that ended 7 years ago is more important to her than her own brother getting married.", "> HOWEVER, an invite isn\u2019t a summons.\n\nThe most AITA post ever.\n\nFamilial relations actually matter to most people in the real world.\n\n>\n\nThe fact that your brother hasn\u2019t admitted to having a friendship with your ex for years is a clear indication he is aware of how you would feel about the situation. \n\nHow do you 'admit' to maintaining a relationship with your best friend since *before they married your sister*?", "So, her brother was supposed to give up his close childhood friend because they were young, incompatible, and had a bad marriage?  Seriously?  I understand not wanting him at routine family gatherings, but grownups realize that people maintain relationships despite family members getting divorced.\n\nOP is acting like she's still in high school.  She needs to grow up, show up, smile, wish her brother and his wife \"best wishes,\" and put this behind her if she wants to be viewed as a reasonable adult.", "Ummm she married his childhood friend. She already knew they were friends.", "Because a large subset of AITA thinks only of themselves. It's a common issue with teenagers. Rugged individuality sounds so nice in theory, but in practice it's isolating and hard.", ">If it is no bother why was her brother not open about keeping up a relationship with her ex?\n\nWhere does the expectation that the brother would drop OOP's ex come from? They were friends from childhood and since it was a no-fault end of the marriage, there was no reason for the brother to drop the ex.\n\nOOP is suffering from a case of main-characteritis.", "The brother did not hide it from her. Brother and ex have been friend for a long time, before OP and ex got married. I bet Brother and ex did things together leading up to the marriage and even after the marriage. She knew darn well they were going to continue being friends. If she wanted to ask her brother to dump his friend. She  needed to start the conversation. Now she's doing some immature \"but I didn't knoooow\" She needs to grow up. Sit with your parents and ex will not likely come over...unless of course, parents have remained in contact with him.!", "I mean there's no obligation to do anything at all if you're looking at it that way. You could just ran around naked in the street hurling bagels at random people. But people will consider you an asshole, and that's what the question is here. Not going to the wedding of close family is the way to not have close family any longer.", "definitely. I know that individualism has gotten extreme over the past couple decades, but this is a step way too far \n\nit comes down to culture though, and what your obligations to your family are", "Yea like these decisions have weight to them. Op will be sending a message by not going. If she's ok with it fine. But as long as they're aware", "There is a reason Ex is called an Ex. If want to physically share space, they would not become EX.\n\nIf any are concerned about OP'S  mental health, then they may gain perspective.\n\nI have stated my opinion that if whole family can gang up and scape-goat OP,  then I cannot support them.\nOP should not be forced to be in Wedding party as per her wish.\n\nI support the OP as NTA.", ">There is a reason Ex is called an Ex. If want to physically share space, they would not become EX.\n\nokay? no one's arguing that they should get back together, or that OP should forgive, or even that they should hang out again, but she should at least consider sucking it up for the wedding.\n\n>OP should not be forced to be in Wedding party as per her wish.\n\nthat's fine, there would be some fault if the family tries to shame her into the wedding party if she doesn't want that level of involvment, OP is planning to skip the wedding all together though which is the real ahole move\n\n>If any are concerned about OP'S mental health, then they may gain perspective.\r  \n\r  \nI have stated my opinion that if whole family can gang up and scape-goat OP, then I cannot support them\n\nHonestly, based off of OPs actions, this sounds like the brunt of this should fall mostly on OP. they have provided the fact that a)Ex and brother have been friends long before OP and ex were dating, and b) OP basically ghosted her family after everything was said and done. No one's \"scape-goating\" OP, but the fact that Ex was probably considered family before they were even dating and the fact that OP had to put in effort to rebuild her family connections since she temporarily cut ties with them means its not an easy cut case. realistically she has all the burden of proof to give her family a proper reason for her ultimatum, and why she would be the right one in this situation. if she feels victimized that's on her, and it sounds like she should see someone about her feelings tbh, unless we find out there's a good reason that makes her actions justified.", "she isn't vetoing her relationship with her siblings friends. she just said she won't go.", "I have an ex where we ended things due to it being a toxic relationship.\n\nSeveral years later, we reconnected, had a conversation and we both realized we were different people than the ones we were in that relationship.  We grew and evolved.  During that conversation, we forgave each other and became friends.\n\nHe\u2019s still a close friend of mine 20 years later.\n\nBottom line?  I would suggest having a conversation with your ex to see what kind of person he is now and see if you can at least be civil without causing undue stress and anxiety.  If you can\u2019t, back out of the wedding.  If you can, it simply means that you have moved on, grown and learned from the experience.\n\nIf you don\u2019t at least have the conversation before the wedding, YWBTAH.", "NTA.  You don't want to go then you don't go.   Your brother would rather have your ex at his wedding than you, his sister.  That should say a lot.", "Eh, at best it\u2019s ESH.\n\nIf your ex had abused or cheated on you, I\u2019d be fully on your side. But according to your own description, you divorced because you were both too immature and didn\u2019t get along. Your family isn\u2019t required to cut contact with your ex just because you fell out of love- especially if they had independently been friends with him, as appears to be the case for your brother. It\u2019s an AH move on your part to demand he choose between you and his friend, especially after he said they\u2019d do their best to limit interactions between the two of you. I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid 6 times. And in all of those weddings, I only ever **briefly** interacted with the groomsmen at the rehearsal and the wedding itself, and even then it was mostly limited to the guy I walked the aisle with. I really think you should be able to suck it up for the sake of your brother. You became an AH when you threatened to not even attend the wedding as a guest (in which case there is NO reason why you\u2019d have to interact with ex) if he was involved. Your mom shouldn\u2019t badger you either, but frankly she\u2019s right. Grow up.  So more Y T A than anything.\n\nThat being said, I think that once you said no to being a bridesmaid, he should have accepted without badgering, regardless of how petty he thought you were being, even if his feelings were hurt and/or disappointed.\n\nSo ESH", "Look OP, the way I see it, you have three options here; one, step down as a bridesmaid, that way, you don't have to see him as much and go to the wedding as a regular guest. Just move on and accept the fact that your brother and ex are actually good friends and it's not your place to dictate who people hang out with, especially without valid reasons (and no, OP, \"I don't like him so you can't like him either\" it four-year-old mentality and doesn't equate to a valid reason). Go to the wedding looking fire and support your brother. Or the last option, what you are considering, don't go at all, just don't complain about it when your brother cuts you off. Your choice will decide whether you are the AITA or not. As far as I see it, for now, I'm voting you are kinda an AH who needs to mature a little, but not a total AH.", "NAH. \n\nYou don't have to go to a wedding at any point and time. In this case, your family should understand why. Just because they don't, it does not make you the AH if you don't go, even if they think it does. \n\nYour brother is not the AH for inviting a lifelong friend to be a groomsman, despite it being your ex. You understand why he is, and that's the most mature thing to understand. \n\nNow if you wanted to really have some fun with this, tell your brother you will go, but as it is for him and not the bride, you want to be the best man. \n\nThen you can support your brother while also getting a higher stair from which to look down on your ex with disdain. Everybody wins with this compromise.", "Info: what aren\u2019t you telling us between you and your ex, did he move on to fast, upgraded etc? You state that there was no abuse or infidelity in your marriage which has be half as long as your divorce, why would that stop you from attending your brothers wedding even as a guest.", "I don't think you're an AH, but it's your brother's big day and clearly your ex and your bro get along well.\n\nMy husband was in one of his best friend's wedding parties with his ex fiance only a year or two after they split up (I'm not sure of the exact timeline). They did not end things on good terms and their friends who got married prohibited either of them from bringing dates so as to not cause or stir up any drama. Looking at the photos from those friend's wedding you'd never tell that my husband didn't want to be anywhere near his ex. \n\nTheir mutual friends have been good with not inviting them to the same events though I have met her once and it was an awkward meet \ud83d\ude05 (my husband wasn't in attendance and I knew it was a possibility she could be there but she'd RSVPed not going then showed up so I wasn't prepared to meet her lol). \n\nAnyway, all this to say. I know my husband ignored his ex as much as he could on the day of his best friend's wedding, but he still went to be there for them and to support them. Even though he and I have been together for a long time now, he still wants nothing to do with her and their friends and family support that decision and don't invite them both to the same event. (The above event was only me not my husband invited too lol). \n\nIf you love your brother, I think as long as he sticks to his promise that you won't be paired up with your ex husband, you should go attend the wedding. You might regret not witnessing your brother get married otherwise.", "NTA\n\nYou're brother can involve who he wants in his wedding and you can choose equally whether you want to attend.\nIt's a shame if you let your ex dictate if you go or not but if you still harbor such strong feelings towards him then it's understandable not wanting to see him.\nIs part of the reason you feel so strongly about not attending is because your brother kept his relationship with your ex hidden for 5 years? \nI would find this sketchy even if you had parted on good terms instead of bad.", "Why can't he just attend as a guest? Sister should definitely be more important, why can't he be the one who just pops in for a couple of hours? Instead he gets the red carpet treatment", "NTA\n\nyou know all of the reasons why you were toxic together with ex, but maybe ex sugar coated it to Bro and has ulterior motives too in this. Maybe it\u2019s time to share with brother all of the good, the bad, and the ugly of your relationship with ex, so that he can better understand why you don\u2019t want to be in the same room as ex. I\u2019m sure ex has been super sweet with bro and other family members since you moved away.", "Nah - what's with all the y t a ? You can decide to not go if the conditions make you uncomfortable enough. The same way your brother can invite your ex if it's important to him.\n\nThe only ah here are your family telling you to grow up. There's no growing up to do.

HOWEVER If my brother invited my ex to anything other than his wedding, I would skip the event. No abuse happened, but I was really hurt by him and don\u2019t want to have to see him again (ever). Idk if that\u2019s unpopular, maybe so, but it is how I feel. I wouldn\u2019t skip my brother\u2019s wedding over it, but literally any other event I can think of yes, I would skip.

Just because a relationship doesn\u2019t work out doesn\u2019t mean that brother can\u2019t be friends with both OP and her ex. I\u2019m sure they both have good qualities and flaws. Brother can like them for the good qualities and accept their flaws.", "Forcing him to choose is what would make you the asshole, not whether you decide to attend.", "There was no abuse, no kids, no contentious divorce.  Just two young kids who realized they sucked together and got out relatively quickly.\n\nIn all honesty it sounds like a good result for all involved.  Op should be able to get over SEEING A PERSON for her brothers day.\n\nNot beiyin the wedding party makes sense, because being forced to be together is kinda what made them fucked up in the first place", "Hey just so you know I'm staying friends with my friend.", "I started reading expecting a story about the ex being abusive or unfaithful or such but it was none of that.

That's incredibly selfish and not considering at all what his wedding guests might need.
