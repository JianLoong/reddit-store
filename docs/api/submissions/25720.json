They are planning on getting married next spring/early summer.  They have been working on putting their wedding party together and they did a video call with me (32F) a couple weeks ago to ask me to be a bridesmaid.  I of course agreed because I love them both and I am very happy for them.  \n\nHowever, during the call, and after I had already agreed to be a bridesmaid, my brother dropped a bomb on me.  He said that he hopes this doesn't cause any issues, but he wants to ask my ex-husband (30M) to be one of his groomsmen.  My initial reaction was not the best, I basically said \"What?  Why?  Are you serious? WTF?\"  \n\nFor some history, my ex and I were high school sweethearts and married young.  We were both 23 when we married and were divorced by the time we turned 25.  No infidelity or abu$e of any kind, just a toxic relationship we were too young to recognize properly and eventually we got to a point in our marriage where we just hated each other.  Thankfully, we never had kids and we were too young to have many assets, so the divorce was easy since neither of us wanted anything to do with the other.  I moved away, got a new job, and started a new life.  My ex stayed in our hometown (where my brother currently lives).  I haven't spoken to my ex in almost 5 years.  \n\nObviously, my brother has known my ex for a long time and they were always close.  Apparently, they remained close friends after the divorce even though my brother never mentioned it to me.  My brother told me that he understands this might be a bit awkward, but it's just for one day and it's not like my ex and I are going to have to walk down the aisle together.  He said they will try to do whatever they can to keep distance between us if needed, but that both me and my ex are very important people to him and he wants both of us involved in his wedding.  \n\nI know a lot of people will probably call me petty and immature, but I want nothing to do with my ex.  There's a reason I haven't spoken to him in so long, I have no desire to speak to him.  Let alone be in the same wedding party as him.  There's going to be a lot of wedding party activities that are going to involve being in close proximity to him for extended periods of time.  I want nothing to do with that.  \n\nI explained all of this to my brother and told him that if he's going to keep my ex as a groomsman, I don't think I can be a bridesmaid and I might have to reconsider even attending the wedding.  This led to a big of back and forth with my brother trying to bargain with me and convince me that it won't be that big of an issue, and me pretty much telling him this is non-negotiable for me.  \n\nSince that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.

And it's understandable to be upset that it feels like someone you loved didn't take your side; however, you need to have an honest conversation with your brother. You need to actually communicate that it hurts that he was just able to overlook everything that led to the end of your marriage and stay friends with your ex. \n\nYour feelings are not invalid, but if you love your brother and want to maintain a relationship with him, you need to talk with him about the real reason you're upset, and figure out a way to move forward.", "Or, your brother could support you by picking a different groomsman and explaining that: really sorry, bud, gotta support my sister on this one.

Your refusal to \u201csuck it up\u201d is totally your call - but, lets be clear, if weddings were parties where everybody had to get along with everybody else in order to accept an invitation, it might be pretty hard to get the couple, two witnesses, and an officiant - let alone attendants and guests.  So that is a bit of an AH move - but ultimately it is your call.  So do what you want to do. Accommodations can be made to minimize putting people together that shouldn\u2019t be together.  It sounds like brother is trying to do that.  He just shouldn\u2019t have trapped you.  \n\nSummary: 1) Brother is an AH for cornering you into this situation. 2) You are an AH for not even trying to work out a scenario where you can honor your brother and avoid your ex. You had your wedding and made your decisions for it.

Why does this man still have so much power in your mind that your hatred still burns this hot?

You were within your right to decline being made a bridesmaid. However, you attending the wedding is not putting you in close proximity with your ex. If your relationship had no abuse and no infidelity and was just toxic due to maturity and incompatibility, then you attending as a guest to support your family despite who his friends are shouldn't be a debate. Unless your not being honest with yourself and the relationship with your ex, based on what you shared neither of you have any dealings that would necessitate any conversations and you both van avoid each other during the wedding.\n\nYour boundaries are your own and should not be forced on others. And your boundaries should be respected in return. But a boundary is just that. It's yours, no one else's.

And if they somehow think they can trick you, say ex won't be there, and you show up, you will turn around and walk away.  This is a choice your brother has, he can have you at the wedding or ex, but not both.   \n    \n>  Since that conversation, I have been contacted by our other sister (26) and my mom pretty much telling me to grow up and that I'm being petty and immature and that I can handle being in the same general area as my ex for a short period of time to support my brother.    \n    \nHonestly, with your brother, sister, and mom behaving like this, I would just respond with \"sorry, you have all been so disrespectful to me, I won't be attending no matter what now.  Thanks for the invite, I hope you have a wonderful wedding, but I won't be there.\"   \n    \nPlan yourself a nice vacation somewhere, enjoy yourself, and forget about the wedding.", "NTA.  Now that your fully informed of who makes up the wedding party, you are no longer interested.  And an invite is just that, an invite.  You are under NO obligation to attend.  Your brother can be friends with whomever he wants, and you can spend his wedding day doing what makes you happy.  You are NOT petty or immature.  I'm 56 and don't go places where I know people I don't care for will be.", "This makes me wonder if your brother had come clean about being friends with your ex earlier, like YEARS earlier, maybe it wouldn't have been such a shock to you about the wedding. Because a big part of the response seems to be shock. \n\nI'm ticked off for you that your other sister and mom are insulting you in an effort to convince you to cave. That seems so manipulative. \n\nI don't know how long you've been thinking about it, OP. If your desire to avoid your ex outweighs your desire to attend your brother's wedding, then don't go. But if you think you can muster thicker skin by the wedding, and want to be there, go. \n\nI'm going with NTA. Because I'm pretty sure if I ever get divorced from someone, I wouldn't want to see them again if I could avoid it. I have some friends who lament that they have to deal with their exes in custody transfers and things like that. They wish they were free of their exes, altogether.", "Why don\u2019t you just go as a guest and ignore him at the wedding? Just don\u2019t be in the wedding party with him.", "Nope.  You don\u2019t have to \u201cget over it\u201d.   And anyone who tells you to should be told to go pound sand.  You didn\u2019t make a scene, you didn\u2019t yell at him, you didn\u2019t go running to family and friends saying how unfair and mean they are being.   You simply told him that you have no desire to be in the presence of your ex and that you wish your brother and his bride well.   to your mother and sister, I would also be temped to say: \u201cthank you SO very much for having my back and supporting me.   I can\u2019t tell you how much love I feel from you right now.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nI think if you don't want to be IN a wedding with your ex, totally fine to decline. \n\nAnd I also understand your reaction to saying you might not go at all initially, because you were shocked to find out they were even friends/close enough to be in the wedding. This was all new information for you, so I can understand your reaction. \n\nAnd honestly, I'd be pissed too. For 5 years they have been friends- close enough to be in his wedding- and NO ONE mentioned that? With anything like this, sometimes the thing that hurts the most is feeling like family/friends lied to you or kept things from you, and kind of agreed to do so. Maybe if your brother had dropped a nugget or two over the years of him seeing your ex, this would be a different story. \n\nYour mom and sister are definitely AH's for just telling you to grow up. Did they know about this friendship and also purposefully never told you? Why would they do that if the didn't think it was a \"big deal\" that would hurt your feelings. So now you need to get over something that everyone thought you were too sensitive to know about for the last 5 years. THAT would be a dealbreaker for me. \n\nYour family, and probably lots of comments, are going to focus on \"it's your ex, get over it\" but this isn't about being in a room with your ex (which of course you may not want to be either) but about family keeping your ex in their lives and purposefully keeping that from you and now wanting you to be okay with it.", "You are allowed to choose whether or not you go.

Perhaps he did too? \n\nI would also assume there are other things you\u2019re not sharing here that makes this an issue for you. In that case maybe not such a huge asshole, but maybe a teeny-weeny one? \n\nIf you maintain your position it\u2019s up to your brother to choose. \n\nI would go and see my ex.

Your brother can have whoever he wants as a groomsman and you can decide not to be a part of it. You said there was no abuse or infidelity so I'm not sure why you are so against it but the reason is not my business. Just be prepared to no longer have a good relationship with him if you decide not to attend. Since you didn't give any good reason why you can't suck it up for one day, you are coming off as immature and petty and I'm sure your brother is hurt by it.

Your brother has the right to have your ex as his groomsman and you have the right to not go to the wedding. What people don't understand is that even though it has been 5 years since you divorced, a situation like a wedding can bring up a lot of old, painful memories that you may not want to experience. You are put in an untenable situation. If you go, you will be miserable. If you don't, you have to face bad feelings from your family but you have to do what is best for you. And you are the only one who knows that.", "Putting your brother in the position of having to choose between two people he cares about equally just because you're hung up on a relationship that went south mutually (meaning your ex didn't do anything like cheat or abuse you) to the degree that even being in the same room with the guy is beyond your ability to handle is, yes, an asshole move. Especially you saying you may not even attend the wedding if your ex is there.\n\nThe message your sending to everyone (other than the one that's already been pointed out: that you're immature), whether you realize it or not, is that you aren't over your ex and that you will allow his presence to control your choices.

If you can't be civil to your ex, then just stay away from him.", "YTA. You do need to be more mature, his wedding is about him, not you, so you don't get to dictate who he chooses as his groomsmen. It would also be shitty to not show up for him, since that would be putting him in a \"him or me\" situation. Trust me, a wedding is stressful as it is and this would make it even harder. \n\nThis is something that can be easily fixed with a conversation, negociating what events you'd like to attend and maybe choosing \"non-essential\" ones that either you or your ex can mix, so you keep contact at a minimum. This discussion could also be about fixing the sitting problem so you can keep your distances. \n\nTalk it out, and go to your brother's wedding.

I get that you don\u2019t like the guy but there was no abuse or cheating and it\u2019s been 5 years. It just kinda paints you as an unreasonably bitter ex.

Your brother understands this is a tricky situation and he's willing to make arrangements to keep you apart as much as possible. And your ex wasn't abusive to you.

Who gives a crap about the ex you haven't seen in 5 years?  Just be civil and enjoy the day.  I think you would regret not being there for your brother and SIL.

I get dropping out of the bridal party for all the reasons you stated.", "YTA you would make this a big deal when you yourself said it was a relationship you both grew out of.  No one said you had to get back together or speak more than hi and bye.  This is your HS attitude on full alert.  Grow up and be an adult.  HS was years ago and cutting someone out of everyone\u2019s life because OP doesn\u2019t want contact is childish.  This is something you grow out of as you become an adult.  Not having contact because you moved on and away it\u2019s all well and good but to expect everyone else to cut this person out because you are no longer together is what\u2019s wrong with this situation.  I bet the reason the relationship didn\u2019t work out is because OP never matured like her ex and is still stuck as a perpetual teen with all those misconceptions.  So your making your brother choose, don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t win.

I thought you had moved on, if that\u2019s true then why do you care?", "For all those who think that OP is TA... Please answer why the brother has never mentioned the ex being a continued part of his life until AFTER getting agreement that she would be a bridesmaid. The brother knew exactly what he was doing, very underhanded.\n\nNTA from me.

She says they were always close.", "She is 100% making him choose. She has expressed that there was no abuse or infidelity. Their relationship just wasn't right for them. She then decided to move away for half a decade while him and a close friend continued to have good experiences together. She's telling him that he should throw away a relationship that he's fostered for a long time or else she won't be there to support him. If this was a trip to the fucking amusement park or a vacation spot, sure. But this is his wedding. She clearly just doesn't give a fuck a brother.", "Yes, that was Abe - but that prick Thomas Edison took all the credit for it.", "He told her AFTER she had agreed to be a bridesmaid, and then tried to guilt her.", "oh then my apologies professor", "Glad your mandatory psychology course has gotten you so far lmao.", "No she agreed to be a bridesmaid then he told her he hoped she wouldn't mind this...something he knew she probably would mind. He knew asking her to be a bridesmaid and her accepting would make her feel like she had no coice but to be ok with it. Saying he didn't know this is absolutely silly.  She never said she didn't want to know. She said she chose not to have anything to do with her ex. If I have an ex, thar has issues with seeing me I'm not going to hang around his family. That's weird at least to me and most people I know it is but I'm sure there's other family's where it's not weird so idk", ">Apparently, they remained close friends after the divorce even though my brother never mentioned it to me.\n\nWhere I'm from that's called hiding.", "Then why didn't brother mention it BEFORE asking OP to be in the wedding party?\n\nINFORMED consent is vital, and he purposely DIDN'T inform her at the time he was asking.", "This is what I\u2019m seeing.", "Well said", ">Why does the fact that OP and Ex had a toxic relationship mean that he's obligated to abandon his friendship, that existed before the two of them ever got together? \n\nThat was never asked. It's funny how he didn't tell her about said friendship, though. Obviously, he knew how frayed the relationship was. They divorced after having been childhood sweethearts. \n\n>And maybe he didn't anticipate this moment in the sense that he expected that his sister would put aside her feelings for an ex she broke up with half a decade earlier? Maybe he didn't think she'd put him in a position where he'd be forced to choose, because he thought she was more mature or less petty than that?\n\nYeah, I'm sorry dude. There isn't a set timeline for reconciling those emotions. Again, he had an idea this would be an issue. He put himself in that position. Waiting until the last minute? Really? He knew.", "Where do you get that the brother and the ex were friends before ex and OP got together?  OP says they were high school sweethearts, so, they probably started dating around 16? So brother was 13 at that point, and in (maybe, at most) junior high. I can\u2019t think of a situation where the scenario of brother and ex being close predated OP and ex being a couple, the reverse timeline is much more likely. \n\n\nBeyond that, brother saw, pretty much firsthand, his toxic the split was: he would have been 22 at the time, and living right there. \n\nNow, staying friends with ex after OP moved, nothing wrong with that, but he knew how OP felt - it is implied OP moved to a different state largely to get away from ex\u2019s environment - so OP wanting to be nowhere around ex should have been expected.", "If I was friends with my sibling's ex spouse, whom they had a very toxic relationship with, I wouldn't hide it. That's suss as hell.", "Do a bunch of your friendships include ex spouses of your siblings?", "It\u2019s not some random friendship. It\u2019s her fucking ex husband. It was so rough on her that she quit her job and moved to another city", "Tom sure isn\u2019t the brightest bulb around! \ud83d\udca1", "It was the same call though lol. How hard is it to just say, \u201coh, never mind\u201d? Instead she has to go nuclear and decide she\u2019s not even gonna go to the wedding at all? Incredibly petty and unnecessary. YTA", "No, you don't need to apologise at all. You merely stated an observation.", "Obviously he knew she wasn't talking to her ex. \n\nNot obvious that he knew that, after five years, she still couldn't stand to be in the same room as him.", "No, but I have friends who are still friends with my ex-wife; I don't expect them to give me updates on her life or their friendship with her, but I know that the ones who knew her before she and I got together are still friends, and I fully expect that she'd be at their weddings. They don't talk about their friendship with her, though; why would they? They know its my ex, so what would be the point of bringing it up?", "It's also not some random friendship: it's someone he was close to *before OP and Ex ever got together*. \n\nI've been through a divorce. I know that it can be rough, firsthand. But also, it's been five years since they saw each other; they've been divorced over twice as long as they were married.", "You\u2019re being purposely obtuse. If they\u2019re so close, and yet the friendship NEVER came up in 5 years it\u2019s because he knew she would be upset", "Why would he bring it up, though? It's her ex. They had a bad relationship and got divorced; *of course* he wasn't making a point of talking about Ex and his friendship with Ex.\n\nWhat would be the benefit of him rubbing salt in her emotional wounds? That doesn't mean he was expecting her to pull \"I won't attend your wedding if he's there, too.\" Come on.", "She knew about their friendship already. Why would it need to come up specifically?\n\nIt would be different if there had been abuse, or some other such shit going on. But toxic relationship can easily form just from two incompatible people who are young and not dealing with emotions well, neither of them being deliberately bad person. OP and her ex tried, it didn't work out. It can still be rough, but it's also been already half a decade."]}
