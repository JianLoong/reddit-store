I\u2019m very glad that he\u2019s starting to grow out of that and will sometimes take a bottle then sleep with a pacifier. \n\nMy ex and I decided to go our separate ways. We knew it would happen one day, hence why we never got married. Divorce is expensive as hell. We\u2019ve started seeing other people and finally found a shared custody agreement that works for us. His new girlfriend just moved in with him. This isn\u2019t a post to diss her, I love her. She\u2019s great with our kids and they love her. I couldn\u2019t of asked for a better step-mother for them. \n\nWhen I went to pick them up today, I found her breastfeeding our son getting him ready for a nap. I asked her to stop and wanted to just leave it at that. She texted me later that she\u2019s been doing that every time to sooth him and it really helps. I replied to her message just explaining that I\u2019m trying to get him away from needing to be breastfed to sleep. Nothing mean, nothing rude, and nothing degrading. A couple hours later, she calls me and I miss it. She left a voicemail cussing me out and telling me I called her a bad step-mother for not letting her feed him like that. \n\nI was blown away that she would even say that.
