My ex and I were never married. We have two wonderful kids (16 and 1). I\u2019ve been weaning our 1 year old son off breastfeeding with pacifiers. He takes them very well until he gets tired. He\u2019s in the routine of once he gets tired, that\u2019s when he knows it\u2019s time to get fed. I\u2019m very glad that he\u2019s starting to grow out of that and will sometimes take a bottle then sleep with a pacifier. \n\nMy ex and I decided to go our separate ways. We knew it would happen one day, hence why we never got married. Divorce is expensive as hell. We\u2019ve started seeing other people and finally found a shared custody agreement that works for us. His new girlfriend just moved in with him. This isn\u2019t a post to diss her, I love her. She\u2019s great with our kids and they love her. I couldn\u2019t of asked for a better step-mother for them. \n\nWhen I went to pick them up today, I found her breastfeeding our son getting him ready for a nap. I asked her to stop and wanted to just leave it at that. She texted me later that she\u2019s been doing that every time to sooth him and it really helps. I replied to her message just explaining that I\u2019m trying to get him away from needing to be breastfed to sleep. Nothing mean, nothing rude, and nothing degrading. A couple hours later, she calls me and I miss it. She left a voicemail cussing me out and telling me I called her a bad step-mother for not letting her feed him like that. \n\nI was blown away that she would even say that. We agreed that she could nurse him if she felt like she wanted to. This wasn\u2019t new knowledge to her either. She was there when I laid out his new schedule and things I\u2019ve been trying to with him.

All these not the assholes at this idea are totally missing the question. As for not nursing a fussy baby, offering a pacifier is the worst thing possible. It's teaching that poor baby to substitute a piece of plastic for the warmth of being held. Not much eating involved in that circumstance, mostly being calmed by being held.", "This cannot be real...

I hope you saved it so you can let her husband hear it..stop interacting with her until you talk to your child\u2019s father about what you saw , said to her and her reaction to it and as I said let him hear the voicemail. And you two need to come up with an arrangement because frankly I don\u2019t see how or why she would be trusted around your kids alone while they are so young ever again .. if she doesn\u2019t know that despite her being married to their father she is not their mother and is not related to them except thru marriage and doesn\u2019t giver her any rights to get to call shots concerning any decisions that are made concerning your kids.\n\nEdit: hold up your letting this woman breastfeed your child?
