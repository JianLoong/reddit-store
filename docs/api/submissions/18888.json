Even if I drove down the day prior to get her.", "My family has a really fantastic habit of making every event about them.  I graduated HS - it was a way for my mom to throw a party for adults and none of my friends were invited.  I graduated college - my parents made sure to talk about my sister and her life struggles the entire time.  I got engaged and my dad's response was \"congrats - did you see your sister got a new car?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd they're traveling overseas right now - they weren't supposed to be back to the States until January, but they'll be back right before our courthouse wedding.", "Yeah no that's messy.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m not willing to change the dates. \n\nWhen we started planning the courthouse ceremony I asked her in February and again in March. I wanted to lock down who all was going to be there so I could get gifts and make her feel like a \u201creal\u201d bridesmaid. When she wouldn\u2019t give me a definitive answer I asked a friend. \n\nWe used to have a really rocky relationship growing up due to substance use on both our ends. We got sober and moved on different paths, but ended up within 3 hours of each other. She\u2019s never come to visit me without me going to get her first since she always had car issues or cash flow issues. \n\nWhen I started dating my fianc\u00e9 I spent less time going to see her so he and I could build a relationship. We moved in together and I don\u2019t have great service (it\u2019s in the woods in a tin house). She says I stopped being receptive to her calls but really I just never had service.", "NTA with regard to the MOH situation, but personally think you are cruel to exclude your immediate family. Why did you even bother to tell them? You could have just said later that you eloped.", "Nta", "You are not selfish.\n\nYou asked your sis and she turned it down.  It is YOUR schedule not hers\n\nNTA", "NTA go no co tact with your family. They sound exhausting.", "NTA. \n\nShe was your first choice. She was non responsive and flakey. You took the hint and made other arrangements. She does not get to be upset about that. If she was so desperate to be your witness, she should have responded sooner. \n\nSounds like your sister is the golden child. My condolences. I suspect that because she is used to getting her way, and being the centre of attention, she was going to find a problem with your wedding regardless, so it\u2019s probably good that you\u2019re putting your foot down now."]}
