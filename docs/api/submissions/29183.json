Absolutely NTA. I was in a similar situation since my husband's sister lives in Europe. We literally planned the wedding around the dates she (and her family) could come we had a 4 week window for the whole year and we planned it then. \nAlso it was very inportant for my grandma to make it so we paid for her hotel room in the hotel next door to the venue. \nIt is horrible behaviour to expect people to prioritize your wedding when you do not prioritize them at all.", "Tell her if she wants you to prioritize her wedding you need a check for the full amount of your semester of school that she's expecting you to ditch/postpone for her day.

I don't think OP would be shocked if the sister didn't set the precedent that she *expected* OP to go to her wedding. If the sister had been more easy going about it and said \"okay OP, I want you at the wedding but I have to pick what works best for me. I'll be disappointed if that coincides with your stuff, but maybe we can figure out another way for you to celebrate with us\" or something, OP wouldn't so surprised. \n\nThe reason the sister gave was finances, which is entirely possible as we don't know her financial situation, but she's also being hypocritical, bc she accused OP of not putting family first and yet she's doing the same thing and doesn't seem to understand and acknowledge that. OP, so far, has the benefit of not being hypothetical.", "Where is Op shocked or is her worry not concern that she will be blamed for something out of her hands as so many family/members tend to do?", "NTA- And, sorry but your sister sounds horrible.
