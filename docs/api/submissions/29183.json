I would say N a h except that you say she \"blames your for not caring.\"\n\nObviously it's important for you to finish up your schooling.  You told her in advance what dates worked for you.  Those dates apparently didn't work for her, and that's fine. She also had other things to consider than just you.  But, she doesn't get to be mad about it, when she was made aware.", "NTA.

She has control over when her wedding is. You have no control over when your graduation is.  She is the one who is not purposely not prioritizing family, when you obviously tried to help her to do so. NTA", "NTA. If she had been gracious about it and expressed understanding, then I\u2019d say N A H, but she started pressuring you to prioritize her wedding over your last round of exams and graduation? Nope, she\u2019s done, you are squarely cleared of asshole status.", "NTA.  \n\nSend your regrets with the rsvp.  Tell her you have set your priorities.  You understand her finance trouble as weddings can be expensive.  So can college tuition, books, etc.  and you\u2019re setting your mom/dad\u2019s finances and expectations as top priority and finishing your last year and last exams and super important as anything less would be disrespectful.  Skipping exams and zipping off to America to a one day party and celebration would be very irresponsible and disrespect your parents so you\u2019re staying for exams.", "NTA, the wedding is during your finals, if you miss, it will ruin your college years, who is talking about putting family first!
