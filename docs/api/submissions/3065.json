It sounds like you\u2019re using her for her labor which another Redditor pointed out. \n\nNot only that but if she IS a good cook, maybe being a professional chef is in her future.

Either of those reasons YTA definitely!!", "YTA. First off: if she gets in trouble at school then they will punish her with what they think fits, if they don't punish her then it means they think it doesn't matter enough. But more importantly if she gets punished at school, you do not punish her at home for the same thing. I know, shocking, but if you have a bad day at work, your daughter/husband/whoever will not then proceed to make sure you have a bad evening at home. It's the same situation. Her teachers won't give her detention because she talked back to her grandma either. Do you understand? Second: you dislike cooking and every little thing means she has to cook while you don't, I'm sure you're on the lookout for those. And lastly: you need to take a step back and also a step down, your daughter is 16 and while she's not an adult, she should be able to communicate her feelings and opinions and your role is to help her do so in a constructive way.

You lack critical thinking and that comes from your laziness. The only thing that kinda worries me, is that unconsciously your daughter might pick up your behaviour and end up being a lazy adult too. All these things are very subtle and they might take a lot of introspection and years of perspective to see, so you can't expect your teen daughter to get it now, in the same way you can't expect yourself to see it now without being open to the judgement and maturing a bit.", "I know how to cook.
