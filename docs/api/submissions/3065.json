It sounds like you\u2019re using her for her labor which another Redditor pointed out. \n\nNot only that but if she IS a good cook, maybe being a professional chef is in her future.

Either of those reasons YTA definitely!!", "YTA. First off: if she gets in trouble at school then they will punish her with what they think fits, if they don't punish her then it means they think it doesn't matter enough. But more importantly if she gets punished at school, you do not punish her at home for the same thing. I know, shocking, but if you have a bad day at work, your daughter/husband/whoever will not then proceed to make sure you have a bad evening at home. It's the same situation. Her teachers won't give her detention because she talked back to her grandma either. Do you understand? Second: you dislike cooking and every little thing means she has to cook while you don't, I'm sure you're on the lookout for those. And lastly: you need to take a step back and also a step down, your daughter is 16 and while she's not an adult, she should be able to communicate her feelings and opinions and your role is to help her do so in a constructive way.

You lack critical thinking and that comes from your laziness. The only thing that kinda worries me, is that unconsciously your daughter might pick up your behaviour and end up being a lazy adult too.

You seem like you view your daughter as a tool instead of as a person. \n\nYour daughter is going through one of the most stressful times in her life and is being constantly punished for what seems to be everything, it's entirely normal to have an emotional slip once in a while - because she is still a child.", "Maybe grandma does suck, but only when she takes her dentures out. \n\nI'm joking!", "Soft YTA - you're following some solid moral values here, but here's my problem:\n\nCooking for the family is a labour of love - if you turn a labour of love into a punishment, then the healthy household dynamic is being torn down. A labour of love deserves love in return - make a good meal for the family, and the family should appreciate the labour and offer love and thanks in retur to the labour provider, in this case - the youngest, most emotionally vulnerable member of the family.\n\nYou're teaching your daughter the wrong message. Even if she's a straight A student, does everything right, you're still going to want her to help out. Show some love - and by that, being the financial provider does not absolve you of acknowledging the emotional labour carried out in the house - meal planning, waiting, cooking, cleaning. These tasks never go away - but neither does the love.

I rarely, if ever, clean because I cannot--even though I know cognitively what the association is--separate cleaning from punishment.  Once in a while I force myself to push a mop around the kitchen floor or scrub the bathtub, but it always feels like I'm being punished when I do so.\n\nIs that the lesson you want to instill in your daughter?\n\nYTA.

So not only are you TA, you're a crap parent and a lazy arse.", "\"She's a really good cook\" \"I hate cooking\" \"it's not even that bad as a punishment\" \"i haven't cooked in 2.5 months because of it\". \n\nSounds like you're using punishment as a guise to have your daughter take care of you. YTA. Let her be a teenager and come home to a home cooked meal for once.", "YTA. You sound like you look for reasons to say she\u2019s in trouble so you can get out of cooking. \n\nThat\u2019s called failing your child. Step up and be an adult. It doesn\u2019t matter that you dislike cooking, grow tf up and deal with it like an adult. \n\nStop forcing your daughter to make up for your incompetence.", "This sounds like you are looking for reasons to ring her up just to get out of cooking.", "I don't think you're the ass hole if it's something she likes to do and if she doesn't fight with you about it I really don't see anything wrong with it", "INFO: Are you a child?", "Yeah, even your dad thinks YTA. And he knows more about it than I do.", "YTA\n\nYour dad is not only a legend but rightful legend, you do the cooking instead of lumping it on your daughter for every minor thing\n\nFace it you\u2019re lazy", "You're going to destroy her love of cooking YTA", "YTA. Seems like you\u2019re just finding a reason to punish her so you don\u2019t have to cook.", "My guess is \u201ctrouble\u201d is deeply subjective here, as getting in actual trouble twice a week is a bigger issue, sounds like grandpa knows he looks for things to punish her over so he doesn\u2019t have to cook. She\u2019s  not your mom, OP, share the work load and stop looking for reasons to make her cook.", "i was thinking this too. by forcing her to cook as a punishment she\u2019s going to grow to resent it. kiss goodbye any possibility of eating her good cooking in the future op, cause she\u2019s never gonna foster that enjoyment and she\u2019s gonna avoid doing it because she associates it with bad experiences. \n\nYTA op. you\u2019re looking for reasons to punish your daughter to skimp out on responsibilities and using your kid for free household labor with no let up.", "so much this. OP is missing such a huge opportunity here. i'd jump on the chance to ask her if she would like to make the grocery list and plan the meals for the family, whereas i could do everything else like taking out the garbage, cleaning the bathrooms, making beds, etc. ask her if she needs new kitchen implements or things like that, offer to special order ingredients like hard to find spices and stuff. make it worth it for her to take over the cooking and she'll be a LOT happier and a happy cook makes better food.", "This! And also if it was a real punishment wouldn\u2019t she be cooking like instead of OP\u2019s spouse, since they \u201cshare\u201d the cooking responsibility. Sounds like OP just makes his daughter cook when it\u2019s his turn!", "I agree - she\u2019s going to kill her daughter\u2019s passion for cooking by sucking all the joy out of it. YTA op.", "Personally I don\u2019t think he\u2019s sexist. I think he\u2019s just a lazy asshole. I have no doubt that if he had a son his son would suddenly be a great cook.", "Sexist and lazy and okay with using his daughter for child labor.....\n\nhe \"needs help raising his child\" uhhhh yeah I doubt it. it seems more like he just, doesn't want to.", "It took almost ten years to get there, but this is exactly how it works in my house. I do laundry, he does the dishes. He mows the lawn, I weed the gardens. He cleans the bathrooms, I keep my kid on top of his own mess. He works, I volunteer and take him to events at school.", "It did me. Now I hardly touch pots or pans....", "Seriously.  If he wants her to cook, how about paying her to cook?  Or set up a rewards systems?", "Also one shouldn\u2019t be using necessary life skills as punishment.  Daily chores like cooking or cleaning up after oneself. Should not have a negative connotation.\n\nOp YTA", "Talking back will be the least of OP\u2019s problems in the future - I see daughter going NC- which means no talking at all", "YTA sounds like you\u2019re proud of yourself for making other people carry your weight.  Why do people have children when they have no desire to be proper parents?", "Punishments for teens almost always have an element of helping around the house - it\u2019s like \u201ccommunity service\u201d. However, if you really want it to be punitive you should have her take the garbage out and scrub the cans rather than a gratifying chore like cooking. The punishment is more about you than her so probably not a good idea. Plus\u2026. she WILL poison you eventually lol", "I got in trouble in school and was grounded from life for a month. I actually started cooking because it was all I could do not to go absolutely insane.", "I have to wonder if she is actually legitimately misbehaving or if OP is finding reasons to punish her, so he doesn't have to cook.  \n\nEven if she was, though, consequences should be directly linked to the problem behavior, not a way for daddy to get out of a chore he dislikes.", "Eh he\u2019s not necessarily sexist. He would probably do the same if it was a son instead of a daughter since he\u2019s a lazy asshole looking for excuses to continue avoiding a \u201cchore\u201d he dislikes.", "I have come to the conclusion that women not working in the 1950s must have been a rich white people  thing because both of my grandmas worked and I keep hearing of other women working as well.", "Exactly", "He is awful. He likes punishing her and making her cook. She will go NC with him and he will deserve it.", "Any time is might be his \"turn\" to cook, he comes up with something she did wrong. What a casually selfish asshole OP is.", "This is my relationship with cleaning and exercise.   Using things you need to do as an adult to have a healthy life as punishment is just wrong because of how it affects your future health.", "Exactly. I can\u2019t even read anymore. It makes me sick.", "She goes NC, and grandpa takes OP out of the will and instead gives everything to her to try and make things right with how poorly OP is treating her.", "Or poisoning him"]}
