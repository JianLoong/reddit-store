But protect the kids please.  You did nothing wrong and everything right it seems.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother was deemed unfit by the state. It was either you take them in or they end up in the foster system. There is no scenario in which she would get her children back.", "You didn't \"steal\" them, the court granted you custody because your mother was declared unfit. AITA doesn't apply here. You are their legal guardian, not her. Block everyone who is messaging you.", "NTA. She was so bad at being their mother that it\u2019s recorded in actual legal documentation. It sounds like she did need help, but it was not YOUR job to do that. You selflessly cared for your younger brothers because no one else could/would, and that\u2019s something to be proud of.\n\nHonestly, if your mom still doesn\u2019t see the massive good you did by taking in the children she failed, then I guess she\u2018s still a bad parent, even if she\u2019s currently sober. Rehab can\u2019t fix narcissism.", "NTA. You are protecting your brothers. I\u2019m sure they would have said something if you would have left them there and not helped out too.", "NTA.  There is a difference between stealing children and having children removed from the parent or parents and placed with someone else.  You took them in and have been raising them with your husband.  If she's spewing all that nonsense about you then I'd say she hasn't really changed.  She hasn't fully acknowledged her addiction and what it did to her life and her family and kids.  Without taking that step she will never recover.", "NTA, but I do think your second reasoning is good (for why you might be the asshole), but don't be harsh on yourself. If your mother is deemed fit to be a mother and does want custody back of her children and the boys are also okay then I do think it is fine, but until then be a good \"mother\" figure to the boys.", "NTA.

Like the old joke says, you can only change a lightbulb if it\u2019s committed to change.", "NTA it's great that you and your husband stepped up to take care of your brothers.\n\nIf you have custody it's completely up to you how to raise the twins, you might want to consider meeting your mother to see if she's improved, and maybe consider supervised visits to start, but it's up to you as you're the legal guardians for the twins now.", "NTA. She got stripped of custody for a reason, and if she actually cared about her children she would be making a real, meaningful effort to reconnect with them and mend her life instead of whining on social media for sympathy. Please stay NC and protect your little brothers.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThere's a difference between stealing a child from their mother and protecting young children from an unfit parent. It was very big of you to step in as their guardian. \n\nIn a case like this, it's not about \"what-if\"s. You did what was best for your brothers at the time, and what is probably still best for them.", "Nta. If you had not taken them they would have ended up in foster care. The authorities would have taken them from her anyway.", "NTA mom shouldn't see the kids until she gets it through her head that they were removed due to her behavior.\n\nIt was not your job at 23 to get your mom help.  She obviously didn't want any.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d them. She LOST them due to HER behavior. You also didn\u2019t make her abuse substances and you certainly didn\u2019t need to take in twin 5-year-olds at 23 years old yourself. She is lucky that she knows where they are and that they\u2019re safe and cared for, not bouncing around the foster system or adopted to someone she will never know and never get updates (even indirectly) from.", "NTA. Sounds like she would have been a terrible mom as evidence by a court declaring her being a terrible mom. It takes a lot to lose custody of kids as a sole parent.", "NTA. IMO people like that (drunks, druggies, abusers etc) should automatically be stripped of custody and never even get the chance to interfere with the kids ever again.", "NTA but I'm curious what your little brothers say of this, do they want to see their mom?", "Who matters more? The ten year olds who are underage and can't protect themselves that you have taken care of for five years so half their lives or your mom that was declared unfit to be a parent to them? \n\nThat's right, the kids. It's nice your mom went to rehab five years later. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't \"steal\" those children. Your mother is unfit to parent. I'd feel the need to be a little petty and use social media to set everyone straight as to why you have custody and explain she's in and out of rehab and that your home and family is a safe, secure, and healthy place for your little brothers to grow up in and that you don't want any more ridiculous messages from people who clearly don't truly care about the wellbeing of your young siblings.\n\nAlso, all the love and kudos to you and your husband for stepping up and stepping in. Not everyone would do that. Your little brothers will always be grateful for this. Stability is not overrated.", " NTA", "NTA - Anyone close enough to have a valid opinion on the matter knows what is up with your mom and agrees with you. If she wants to renew contact with her sons, this is not the way to go about it.", "NTA nope. The fact she chooses to blast you on social media instead of contacting  you tells me where she's at recovery wise. Typical narcissistic behavior, blaming you for stealing them instead of taking responsibility for her own actions. I would be very careful and I think there would have to be a lot of mediation and therapy before she gets to see them. So far she has not proven she's recovered enough to see them. And no, it's not your responsibility to get her help", "NTA. Protect those kids.", "NTA 100%. Your mom was and is the adult, she failed miserably and legally lost her children. Now she\u2019s being petulant, harassing people, eventually gaslighting someone enough to think you\u2019re the bad guy in all of this. There is a term for that in Psychology and it\u2019s called \u201cFlying Monkeys\u201d.\n\nYour mom takes no responsibility for her actions. I suspect she has been emotionally abusive to you your whole life.", "She plays the victim well and she sucks as the parent. NTA If she loved any of her children she would have gotten clean and thanked you and hubby for being parents when she couldn't wouldn't.", "Please do not feel guilty for protecting your brothers. The mom you denied them was one with addiction problems. You did help your mom by taking responsibility for your brothers. You stepped up at a very young age. She is responsible for her own sobriety. You are not just not the AH, you\u2019re basically a hero. I\u2019m sorry those unaware have given you a hard time. Glad your husband set them straight.", "NTA. The courts deemed your mother unfit. They most likely considered the chance of her actually redeeming herself if she had help available and decided that she would not regardless. Do not let the relative or your mother concern you. At the time you were given custody, their father's family was not willing/able to take them in so why do they think you were wrong now. Are your brothers happy? If you can answer that yes, then that is all that is important.", "NTA\n\nNo, OP, no. No matter how much people call it a disease addiction is still ultimately the job of the individual with it to manage and choose to pursue recovery for. Your mother spent years choosing her addiction over you and her son, and it was never your job to fix that. If her choices have robbed her of years with her son that's entirely on her, and you can't possibly suggest it would have been better to subject a five year old to an at the time unrepentant addict in the hopes said addict chooses recovery than to take that five year old in the interim. It's on your mother to prove she's capable, not on you to indulge her.", "NTA 1000 times and what she is doing on social media is absolute proof of that.", "Right? And as far as all the rest go, it's easy to moralize about something when you have no skin in the game. When it's not your baby brothers being starved because your mom spent all the money you gave her on drugs for the third time this week, or something.", "Don\u2019t you think they\u2019ve already had enough disruption in their lives, that they shouldn\u2019t be dragged through being re-adopted back to the abusive parent?", "People DO change.

Good on you!", "I haven't brought it up to them yet. When I was still a child, our mother would go through spurts acting normal and it always crushed me when they ended. \n\n\nI did bring it up with their therapist, and they were of the mind that it's a 50/50 chance that it will set them back or provide some good.", "If their lives were bad enough for the first five years that their mother lost custody of them, they probably don\u2019t have many pleasant memories of a loving household... if they haven\u2019t blocked most of it out.", "And how would you like to be the kid whose life is wrecked by being held back and shackled to low lifes like that? The kid who is neglected, starving, beaten etc? Addicts get too many chances as it is and now you want to sacrifice the well-being of children on that altar? Not in my book. Adopt the kids out soonest for the best results and keep the addicts on birth control until they\u2019re a minimum of 5 years clean, sober and a decent, contributing citizen.", "NTA\n\nWhen it comes to addiction, you can't \"fix\" someone else.  She had to fix herself.  It has been FIVE YEARS and she is only now *supposedly* on the road to recovery.  That is how long it took her to actually be ready to truly fix herself.  Which, even that, I doubt.\n\nThe fact that she is supposedly in rehab and is blaming others for what happened to her, instead of taking accountability for her actions that endangered her children and led to her losing them - that is a very clear sign that she is NOT in recovery,", "We are in no position to judge. You know the situation a million times better than we do. How do you feel about it?", "NTA but also - hey! I also take care of a much younger sibling (15 year gap). Yours sounds much rougher because of two kids and my sister is an adult now. Just wanted to give you a message of solidarity. It's really cool to meet another sibling-guardian.\n\nAnd yeah, I also received nastygrams from our mother and her father about taking care of her after they refused to do the job. Saying I groomed her and brainwashed her into hating them (although I was in college or working far away since she was 3 because of the gap and uh, they were both quite cruel to her). It's like people can't understand the way they treat their children has consequences.\n\nGood on you for stepping up!!", "NTA you and your husband are good people. Keep protecting your brothers.", "NTA\n\nIf the courts gave you the boys then there was a very good reason for it.\n\nIf your mother was truly better she would not be trying to manipulate people against you for doing what the authorities asked you to do.\n\nPlease continue to keep those kids safe from her until such a time as she proves worthy of a place in their lives.", "Wow. You've never had a loved one or family member struggle with addiction or have struggled with it yourself, have you?\n\nYou're one step away from demanding mandatory sterilization of anyone who is a \"low life\" (whatever your definition of that may be) or an addict. In fact, that's exactly what you're doing - addicts need to be chemically sterilized for at least 5 years of sobriety.\n\nSure, the vast majority of addicts may never clean themselves up and get sober. But making a blanket statement like that about addicts is incredibly facetious, spurious, and ignorant.\n\nIn this particular case, OP is NTA and the mom is an asshole. Mom does not deserve to regain custody of the twins.\n\nBut your generalizations about addicts and your opinions that they should be basically sterilized for at least 5 years \"clean and sober\" are ignorant and cruel.\n\nI was an addict for a brief time after my dad died. It was a very dark time. Should I be stripped of my reproductive rights because I did drugs for a year?\n\nYou've shown you have no idea what it's like to be an addict, and zero empathy or compassion or understanding. I'm conjecturing this part, but you come off as the type who would put the entirety of addiction at the feet of the addict, with 100% of the blame, and say things like \"they could have just chosen NOT to take drugs\" and \"just stop taking them\".\n\nGo adopt all the children of junkies and alcoholics who are in foster care if you want to be so holier than thou.", "NTA. You did what's best for your brother's at the time. She clearly hasn't changed enough if she's slandering you across social media rather than reaching out to request visitation and build up her family again slowly.", "Gotta love the \"I had my kids removed cos I'm an unfit parent, but it's YOUR fault they were placed in a safe and loving environment instead of suffering alongside me while I get help\" mentality.\n\n(I've come across this several times in various circles).\n\nOf course you are NTA. At 5 years old, the priority was to give your brothers a SAFE home. You can't risk their well-being whilst your mom gets her shit together."]}
