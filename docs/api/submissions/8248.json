That's not the issue. I'm sure this behavior has something to do with ADHD and pot smoking but can't say for certain.

I also don't care that he smokes. It does help him (anxiety). My issue is that he will take leftovers out of the fridge to pick at throughout the night and then leave it on the counter overnight. He also leaves his dirty dishes all throughout our bedroom (which has our office space and computers) so I wake up to several dirty dishes all over our desks. Mainly mine because he will set it there also it's not in his way. So now only is he wasting all the food damn near every night but he's also creating a pig sty and he will generally leave the dishes there for 2-3 days before he remembers to bring them to the sink to be washed (I've started refusing with every ounce of my being to clean up after him). I've talked to him about it several times and he merely says he forgets to put things away. Doesn't matter what it is. Leftovers, bread, sandwich meat, condiments, milk, etc. When I'm awake I make sure to go to the kitchen after him and put it away because I don't want spoiled food but I'm usually not awake when he does it and he doesn't even make an attempt to remember to put things away. Same thing for when he makes dinner. Uses every single pan to make something simple (like spaghetti) and then never puts away anything that he uses, including the dishes. Just leaves them wherever they are. And again, I've talked to him and he says he forgets. \n\nSo last night he took out the left over Alfredo and left it right on the stove. I intended to take some with me for lunch but obviously couldn't since he left it out all night. I was fucking pissed because I didn't have time to make myself lunch for work at this point and can't be spending extra money on something on the way because we are financially fucked right now (fraudulent charges to our bank account that we are fighting to get back). So I did wake him up and was pissy about it and basically said that if he was going to be lazy and waste food because he refuses to put anything away after he's done with it and burden me constantly than I would be putting a lock on the fridge. He gets heated and says that he can't believe how ridiculous I am being over something that he \"tries to control but can't\" and for not being more empathetic to his ADHD or giving him reminders.

That sounds like a really horrible way to live and I\u2019d be fed up too! I personally have adhd and I would never want my attention issues to put such a burden on my partner. We work together to address things that I have issues with (such as often forgetting to complete or even start cleaning tasks) so that I have built in accommodations for issues that I know will keep cropping up. I do my best to take responsibility for tasks that I know will be easier for me to keep track of or complete, and I try to always be mindful of those things that I have extra trouble with so that they don\u2019t become a huge burden on my partner.\n\nMy therapist recommended this book called \u201cIs It You, Me, Or Adult ADD?\u201d by Gina Pera, and it\u2019s a really helpful guide on how to manage a relationship with issues caused by a partner having adhd. I\u2019d recommend looking into reading something like that if you want to work on the problems with your marriage. But if you don\u2019t want to put in the work for someone who\u2019s seemingly not putting in the work for you in return, I don\u2019t blame you. \n\nEither way, I think it\u2019s for the best if you have a clear conversation about respect and boundaries in your relationship. You can have adhd and still be a kind and considerate partner. I\u2019d like to think I am one, anyways :)", "Don\u2019t lock the fridge. Lock the front door when he\u2019s outside it.

It\u2019s truly not something he \u201ccan control\u201d but there are ways to circumnavigate this in a way that helps remind him! For example, I always forgot to take my medication. I have to take this one specific one twice a day when I eat and I STILL forget it constantly. But I eat in the same location every day for breakfast and dinner. So I literally sit my medication right there and it never moves. It may not look the cleanest or most aesthetic, but if I move my pill bottle I will not take my medication. \nMy partner specifically does what you mention, and they do it often. They often forget to put things back into the fridge, as do I. So if we take ANYTHING from our kitchen that must be returned (ie, ranch or ketchup etc) we turn on the oven headlight. Then if we are on the way to the bedroom for bed, we notice the light is on, and remember to put things back. I highly recommend this. I\u2019ve tried sticky notes and timers, alarms and changing my habits. But this truly helps us.\n\nI highly recommend trying to watch some of the YouTube channel \u201cHow to ADHD\u201d or watching some content related to being in a relationship with someone who has ADHD, like Meghan&Jack. as they have a lot of content that will help you understand and better communicate with your partner, along with helping you not feel so alone in your frustration.\n\nI wish you both the best.

Absolutely, sometimes you have to get ugly so someone will understand.", "NAH -- purely because of the benfit of the doubt here. TBH, it sounds like a NTA with your SO being TA by acting like they're helpless because of their ADHD.\n\nFirstly, medication is not the only treatment option for ADHD. Is he doing any kind of treatment?\n\nSecondly, please don't use the word \"lazy\" - people with ADHD are not lazy. Like most neurodivergent people, his brain works differently, and society punishes him relentlessly for it. (A good rule of thumb: There is no such thing as lazy--it's actually invisible barriers.)\n\nIt's very difficult to describe execuative dysfunction to someone who doesn't have it. To everyone else, you're \"just sitting around being lazy\" -- but what's actually happens is that you are sitting there, screaming internally to get up and DO THE THING but no matter how much you berate and bully yourself, you cannot do it. Or you need to do the thing -- but then immediately forget what the thing is.\n\nFinally, \"I can't control it\" -- this is, frankly, BS. He cannot control the fact that his brain is not neurotypical. This is true. However, he 100% can develop mechanisms that DO work for his brain. The scenario as it currently exists isn't working, so he needs to change that scenario.\n\nFor the \"dishes left in bedroom\" -- I recommend getting a bus bin (the things people use to bus tables at restaraunts) for the room. Now there's a place for the dirty dishes that doubles as a super easy grab-and-go dirty dish transporter. Even if he still struggles to move the dirty dishes out of the room, at least they won't be all over everywhere anymore. \n\nWhen it comes to leaving food out--especially things like milk--he can try stuff like \"pour it and put it back.\" That's exactly what it sounds like... you pour the milk (or whatever) and put it back before you enjoy your beverage. That way he doesn't have to remember to put it back--putting it back is part of pouring it. The same can be done with food. He wants left overs? Fine, scope out a portion, put it on a plate, put the rest back, then go on to eat.\n\nNote: I am suggesting things that work for my neuroatypical brain--they may not work for him. The important part here is that having ADHD (or any neurodivergent brain type) doesn't mean he's completely helpless at basic life tasks--it means that he needs to change his situation to work for him. And what's more--HE needs to do this. It's on HIM to do.\n\nHe doesn't need medicaiton, but he does need to learn how to do basic life functions.\n\nSome other possibilities: having minifridges in other rooms (in theory, this could address issues related to \"to put the thing away, I need to go into the other room\" or something similar), having alarms that go off at specific times as a reminder \"hey is there food out? put it back now\" kind of things, etc. -- again, it might not work for him.\n\nBut this is clearly not an acceptable way for him to live, and ADHD doesn't mean he's completely helpless and incapbale. He needs to figure this shit out -- and he needs to start NOW. None of this should be on you.\n\nBTW... if he doesn't start adjusting scenarios to figure things out, get the lock for the fridge.\n\nEDIT: First paragraph was missing apparently.", "NTA.

Assuming so, it's because it's a habit, and having ADHD doesn't keep you from maintaining habits.  If you were to put his toothbrush in one of those travel holders with a big note on it \"CLEAN THE KITCHEN BEFORE BED\" then he would have a reminder (for example).  After 2 weeks it should be a habit.\n\nPersonally I know my wife hates a dirty kitchen in the morning.
