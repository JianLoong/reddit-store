Mainly mine because he will set it there also it's not in his way.

I've talked to him about it several times and he merely says he forgets to put things away. Doesn't matter what it is. Leftovers, bread, sandwich meat, condiments, milk, etc. When I'm awake I make sure to go to the kitchen after him and put it away because I don't want spoiled food but I'm usually not awake when he does it and he doesn't even make an attempt to remember to put things away.

That sounds like a really horrible way to live and I\u2019d be fed up too! I personally have adhd and I would never want my attention issues to put such a burden on my partner. We work together to address things that I have issues with (such as often forgetting to complete or even start cleaning tasks) so that I have built in accommodations for issues that I know will keep cropping up. I do my best to take responsibility for tasks that I know will be easier for me to keep track of or complete, and I try to always be mindful of those things that I have extra trouble with so that they don\u2019t become a huge burden on my partner.\n\nMy therapist recommended this book called \u201cIs It You, Me, Or Adult ADD?\u201d by Gina Pera, and it\u2019s a really helpful guide on how to manage a relationship with issues caused by a partner having adhd. I\u2019d recommend looking into reading something like that if you want to work on the problems with your marriage. But if you don\u2019t want to put in the work for someone who\u2019s seemingly not putting in the work for you in return, I don\u2019t blame you. \n\nEither way, I think it\u2019s for the best if you have a clear conversation about respect and boundaries in your relationship. You can have adhd and still be a kind and considerate partner. I\u2019d like to think I am one, anyways :)", "Don\u2019t lock the fridge. Lock the front door when he\u2019s outside it.

It\u2019s truly not something he \u201ccan control\u201d but there are ways to circumnavigate this in a way that helps remind him! For example, I always forgot to take my medication. I have to take this one specific one twice a day when I eat and I STILL forget it constantly. But I eat in the same location every day for breakfast and dinner. So I literally sit my medication right there and it never moves. It may not look the cleanest or most aesthetic, but if I move my pill bottle I will not take my medication. \nMy partner specifically does what you mention, and they do it often. They often forget to put things back into the fridge, as do I. So if we take ANYTHING from our kitchen that must be returned (ie, ranch or ketchup etc) we turn on the oven headlight. Then if we are on the way to the bedroom for bed, we notice the light is on, and remember to put things back. I highly recommend this. I\u2019ve tried sticky notes and timers, alarms and changing my habits. But this truly helps us.\n\nI highly recommend trying to watch some of the YouTube channel \u201cHow to ADHD\u201d or watching some content related to being in a relationship with someone who has ADHD, like Meghan&Jack. as they have a lot of content that will help you understand and better communicate with your partner, along with helping you not feel so alone in your frustration.\n\nI wish you both the best.

Absolutely, sometimes you have to get ugly so someone will understand.", "NAH -- purely because of the benfit of the doubt here. TBH, it sounds like a NTA with your SO being TA by acting like they're helpless because of their ADHD.\n\nFirstly, medication is not the only treatment option for ADHD. Is he doing any kind of treatment?\n\nSecondly, please don't use the word \"lazy\" - people with ADHD are not lazy. Like most neurodivergent people, his brain works differently, and society punishes him relentlessly for it. (A good rule of thumb: There is no such thing as lazy--it's actually invisible barriers.)\n\nIt's very difficult to describe execuative dysfunction to someone who doesn't have it. To everyone else, you're \"just sitting around being lazy\" -- but what's actually happens is that you are sitting there, screaming internally to get up and DO THE THING but no matter how much you berate and bully yourself, you cannot do it. Or you need to do the thing -- but then immediately forget what the thing is.\n\nFinally, \"I can't control it\" -- this is, frankly, BS. He cannot control the fact that his brain is not neurotypical. This is true. However, he 100% can develop mechanisms that DO work for his brain. The scenario as it currently exists isn't working, so he needs to change that scenario.\n\nFor the \"dishes left in bedroom\" -- I recommend getting a bus bin (the things people use to bus tables at restaraunts) for the room. Now there's a place for the dirty dishes that doubles as a super easy grab-and-go dirty dish transporter. Even if he still struggles to move the dirty dishes out of the room, at least they won't be all over everywhere anymore. \n\nWhen it comes to leaving food out--especially things like milk--he can try stuff like \"pour it and put it back.\" That's exactly what it sounds like... you pour the milk (or whatever) and put it back before you enjoy your beverage. That way he doesn't have to remember to put it back--putting it back is part of pouring it. The same can be done with food. He wants left overs? Fine, scope out a portion, put it on a plate, put the rest back, then go on to eat.\n\nNote: I am suggesting things that work for my neuroatypical brain--they may not work for him. The important part here is that having ADHD (or any neurodivergent brain type) doesn't mean he's completely helpless at basic life tasks--it means that he needs to change his situation to work for him. And what's more--HE needs to do this. It's on HIM to do.\n\nHe doesn't need medicaiton, but he does need to learn how to do basic life functions.\n\nSome other possibilities: having minifridges in other rooms (in theory, this could address issues related to \"to put the thing away, I need to go into the other room\" or something similar), having alarms that go off at specific times as a reminder \"hey is there food out? put it back now\" kind of things, etc. -- again, it might not work for him.\n\nBut this is clearly not an acceptable way for him to live, and ADHD doesn't mean he's completely helpless and incapbale. He needs to figure this shit out -- and he needs to start NOW. None of this should be on you.\n\nBTW... if he doesn't start adjusting scenarios to figure things out, get the lock for the fridge.\n\nEDIT: First paragraph was missing apparently.", "NTA.

It will help so he has smaller portions and may only waste that small bit and leave you with your lunch in the fridge. Also start putting little snacks put like nuts or cheese cubes etc in clear dishes for him to nibble on. Adhd'ers are grazers and dont eat \"big\" meals well they do better qith small portions all day. Also have him have some protein power at night that will fill him up. Also have a bowl of snacks where he normally sits they have to be out in front of placss he can see because if he cant see it it dont exist.\n\nFor leaving dishes around start by getting a tray or big container bin tupperware thats see through and have him put the dishes when he is dine in it so he can remember hey take me with you. Also have a app that gives reminders for chores and one of them be he does the dishes. My family wall is the app i use \n\nAlso put garbag cans in all the rooms so he can put his food when he is done in them and its normal for Nero diverse people to have \"doom piles\" which is just a place they keep putting shit.

She didn't get to have lunch today because of his carelessness. Maybe he needs to stop eating food from the fridge during these late night binges and instead have some non-perishable snacks on hand for when he gets hungry so that he isn't causing food to spoil before OP can eat it. Personally, I've found medication to be incredibly helpful, both with accomplishing daily tasks *and* with managing anxiety (something worth considering, as he might not need the pot if he's *properly* medicated, which would probably solve this problem entirely). But whatever it is, he needs to find a solution. He can't just keep saying \"it's my ADHD, I can't help it!\" ADHD can be managed. 80% of people with ADHD benefit from stimulant medication. If he's really adamant about not taking any, then okay, but there's still another 20% of people with ADHD who are managing without, so he needs to find out how *they're* doing it and start taking notes, because this isn't fair to OP.", "You don't have to bandage a wound if you don't want to, but if you choose not to then bleeding on people is kind of your fault.", "Also have ADHD.
