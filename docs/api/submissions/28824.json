A woman demanded info on my condition so I asked her extremely personal questions.", "selftext": "I (49F) was at a state fair yesterday and this woman near me came over and demanded info about my medical condition. Long story short, I\u2019m paralyzed from roughly the bra band down. I use a power wheelchair and have a service dog. I usually don\u2019t mind educating people about paralysis, access issues and chatting about my dog but this woman.. my dudes. She was rude, abrasive and *demanding.* She acted like she was entitled to my personal medical history. \n\nShe didn\u2019t even ask politely, just *demanded* to know how it happened, what the results were, if I tried X, Y, Z treatments, you name it. She even wanted to know about my sex life! Just.. seriously? Who asks this stuff of a literal stranger unfortunate enough to be eating delicious fair food at the table area? I just stared at her in shock as my delicious deep fried BBQ got cold. \n\nSo I smiled as politely as I could manage and this is where I *may* have been the asshole. I started to ask her about her last GYN visit. Were the stirrups too high, did she have to do that awkward shimmy/scoot down the table, if the speculum was cold, if the PAP smear hurt, the usual. If she felt entitled to my answers, I should be entitled to her answers, right? \n\nWell, she threw an absolute fucking fit. Started screaming and yelling that I was gross and a pervert and on and on and on. Her group tried to calm her down and one of them told me I should\u2019ve just been polite and answered her questions. As far as I could tell this woman wasn\u2019t impaired in any way. She didn\u2019t have a carer or minder, she was with a group of friends and had been carrying in normally with them until she saw me. I got to the table, asked it the space was free and set up at the end of the table because my chair fits neatly on the end of one piece picnic benches. \n\nI told the group that if she wanted my personal and private medical information then she should trade info for info. Two of the people called me an asshole when they left, trying to calm down their nearly \u201chysterical\u201d friend as they left. She was still screaming and shouting how I was a perv/cruel/mean. People were staring at me and I hated it. \n\nAt the time I felt good for finally finding a shiny, new (but still broken) spine and standing up for myself. So to speak. I was talking to friends last night and they said I was an asshole, I could\u2019ve politely told her I wasn\u2019t going to tell her. I tried that when she came over and demanded answers, not even asked for them. \n\nSo reddit, I\u2019m asking here. Am I the asshole for not divulging my medical info and asking her about hers?", "created_utc": 1697201844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176y56i/aita_a_woman_demanded_info_on_my_condition_so_i/", "score": 11692, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yet somehow we All manage to resist asking ridiculously invasive questions.  Yeah, the toddlers visiting might, but getting shut down and having proper behavior explained to them by their parents is part of their social learning curve.", "Lmao NTA, not even close, and I truly don't understand how your friends could have thought you were. Your response was perfectly reasonable and also demonstrated the absurdity of her initial behaviour.\n\nSure, it's nice to be polite. But politeness isn't owed to someone who disregards it themselves. That lady was rude and obnoxious and deserved to have her own shit thrown back in her face. Even funnier that she threw a fit for it, I guess she's not used to people not tolerating her awful personality", "NTA - \n\n>She was still screaming and shouting how I was a perv/cruel/mean.

I love your response! \n\nIn all seriousness, you owe no one any information about your life. If someone wants to know about you or your life, they can ask respectfully. If they can\u2019t, well, they deserve what they get. And, let\u2019s face it, assholes call others assholes when they care called out on their own behavior. It\u2019s the pot calling the kettle black.", "NTA. I hope you never have to deal with another person like that again. \n\nBut if you do, I\u2019d very loudly repeat her questions. \n\n\u201cIM SORRY, BUT DID YOU JUST ASK ME ABOUT MY SEX LIFE? WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ASKING SUCH A PERSONAL QUESTION!\u201d", "NTA \n\nI would have asked her friend.  Are you her caregiver? Please explain to her that her questions are so invasive.", "NTA I applaud your kindness in taking the time out of your day to provide this interloper a teachable moment. True charity. (And absolutely NOT sarcastic)", "NTA that was an awesome response, you rock that shiny spine!\n\n I hate how some people think us being disabled means we must be passive and grateful for them even taking the time to take an interest in us, oddly usually the same type of people who complain about a disabled/chronically ill person in their friends group 'always talking about their condition'", "NTA. Honestly, I think what you did was completely fair and her reaction tells you everything you need to know. I understand if it was a kid or young person who was genuinely curious but a grown ass woman? Clown world we live in lol.", "NTA. Good for you. Take care of your new shiny spine, and flaunt it. Don't forget to polish it daily, wouldn't want the sparkle to be covered in road dust.", "NTA - We are not there for people\u2019s education, entertain or inspiration.

She can go fuck herself.", "NTA and people who say otherwise have never been in your shoes.

They continue treating you like a science specimen or a child.", "You are the most awesome I have seen!  That was a perfect response!", "NTA but your friends are.  I guess they aren't the type to walk next to you with a baseball bat.  I'm sorry for that.", "You were NTA. You are a hero. As a fellow disabled person, you are a fucking hero. I want to give you all the flowers. I want to give you a cape. I want to give you a shield and a coat of arms. Service puppy gets a cape too.", "NTA. Your response was perfect!  (Chef\u2019s kiss)", "NTA - if you had politely declined to answer she would have kept harping on it. This was the only way to shut her down.

Could she have politely asked if you would be comfortable answering some questions and try to at least have some grace about it? Also yes.\n\nIf you walk up and start being rude to someone, don't expect them to be polite to you in return. NTA.", "NTA with sprinkles!", "This for real made me LOL. Good for you! I can't imagine having the kind of balls where I just start demanding info from a stranger. So NTA", "NTA - some people are so frustratingly blind to their own behaviour, the only way to get them to shut up is to treat them exactly how they treat others.\n\nDon't feel bad at all. She was a creepy weirdo for asking you personal questions to begin with. If her reaction is to call you a perv, or whatever, that's just her holding a mirror up to her own behaviour.", "NTA I think you handled it perfectly. No one has a right to your personal medical history outside of a medical setting.", "Hahahaha NTA I love it. I've been out in a chair though I'm mostly ambulatory, people just GRAB it to \"help\" and it's like... No, don't just take control of where I am! That's weird. The general public really think we're a teachable moment like we don't deserve privacy!", "NTA\n\nShe was being nosy.\nYour response was appropriate.\n\nI like to ask them \"Why are you asking?\".\n\nGive your dog a pat from me please.", "NTA, and I\u2019m in awe of what you did.", "Lmao I got this one line from the newest animation \"the Grinch\",\n\n\"sorry I don't speak ridiculous\" but I'd say ignorant instead of the latter.", "NTA . \nWhy are people being polite to people like her? \nI never understand these comments.\n\n\"You should have been polite and answered her questions!\"\n\nNo, no you should not! \n\nGood for you!", "NTA. Brilliant response!", "NTA she was being rude and invasive and got a tiny lil taste back of how it feels. She was the AH for sure.", "NTA.\n\nWTH was her issue?  How can your friends sit there and think it's appropriate for her to drill you about your health?  If she had some sort of issue, you should have been told.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA, that's spectacular.", "NTA. Someone I dearly love uses a wheelchair, and it is absolutely disgusting when people think they're entitled to ask deeply personal questions just because they can. \n\nYour friends are massive a-holes, by the way. Instead of being in your corner they are backing up a stranger that was beyond rude to you. Who does that?", "NTA.\n\nI would have told her that her parents must have done a shit job raising her if she thought it was at all socially acceptable to approach a stranger and demand to know their private and intimate medical history.", "NTA\n\nYour friends should think twice about their attitudes.", "NTA\n\nI love your response. \n\nThis is the equivalent to total strangers rubbing pregnant women's bellies and getting upset if the woman is offended. \n\nI admit I can be nosy, but I'd never expect a total stranger to tell me such personal things. At most, I would have tried to strike up a conversation and hinted I was curious about how you get along.", "OMG I wish I'd been there...NTA with sparkly crown on top", "NTA - that was a pretty funny reaction. calm and collected", "NO NTA WTF , what a dumbass, get out of here lady, why should you be polite if the other person isn't, I don't get your friends saying you're the ass. Ahah she called you a pervert..", "I can understand how intrusive that must have felt. The nerve of that woman to demand you answer such personal questions.  NTA", "Just want to point out that you are a very good writer. While reading this, I felt like I was actually there for every bit of it. \n\nBut anyways, NTA.\n\nThe entitlement of some people.

I would not have come up with your replies so fast.   Good for you. That woman was awful.", "Fucking glorious!!!  NTA.  And I would love to be your friend.  \n\nGood for you OP!", "NTA, you did great. Maybe it will teach her not to ask people personal questions,  but given her and her friends' attitudes, I doubt it.", "NTA you let her know how the questions felt to you. Being nice doesnt mean letting people step all over you. She learned a hard lesson. Youre good dude.", "NTA. She was rude, you just held up a mirror.", "NTA - what\u2019s more I think you\u2019re brilliant.  Good for you.", "NTA. Not even the least bit. She got what she deserved.", "NTA. People like that deserve all the rudeness they get in return.", "NTA. People are just so rude. Good on you for flipping the conversation. I've had total strangers ask me such invasive stuff about my reproductive health and finances. I found if I ask them equally invasive questions about their bodies and bank balance they are horrified. Another good response is \"Why do you need to know?\" which nosy people absolutely HATE lol :)", "Did you handle this with grace, poise, and tact? No. \n\nDo I LOVE that you did not? Abso-fucking-lutely!!! You are my hero! Sometimes Assholes deserve a swift kick to the ego. \n\nNTA", "NTA! Your response is golden and also belongs on r/traumatizeThemBack", "You\u2019re brilliant, and I\u2019m so glad you felt comfortable throwing that shit back at her. \n\n1000% NTA. \n\nI follow a few wheelchair-using influencers who are great educators about the daily challenges to navigating a world that\u2019s not designed to be super friendly for them. And there\u2019s one who ALWAYS gets asked in the comments about his genitals. Like, holy shit. There\u2019s this weird bias people have where it\u2019s like they don\u2019t think people with disabilities deserve to have privacy or control over the information they share about themselves. And when you point that out (which I do, whenever I see it on Instagram on his posts) the assholes who think they have a right to know about someone else\u2019s genitals swear at you. Like, what? The audacity of some people, honestly. It\u2019s fucked up (especially because in his case, he literally has videos pinned to the top of his feed explaining his condition, why his body is the way it is, and a really funny one where he pulls out fruit and veg to politely explain that yes, he does have genitals so with like 15 seconds of investigation they could find out that information without asking and showing their ass). \n\nYou existing as a person with disabilities does not mean you\u2019re automatically a disability educator. And she isn\u2019t paying you even if you were.", "NTA. Well, actually, yes T A, but very, very justified, so NTA works. She demanded personal medical info! No one has the right to that except you, your doctor and those you choose to trust enough to share it with. And, honestly? If you're going to go up to random strangers and ask for such personal info, you should expect to be asked for just as personal info in return. Fair's fair, right? If she has a 'right' to your personal info, you have a right to hers too. And like you said, you did try to politely decline to answer her demanding and intrusive questions, and she ignored you. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your right to privacy!", "So much NTA mate.... you did great !", "NTA you are brilliant", "NTA and that was an epic shutdown!", "NTA.", "You are totally NTA, you are a fucking boss. I would have made popcorn to watch that. Ignore the friends are pressuring you to be \u201cnice \u201c and defend those boundaries.", "NTA. I think more people should be like you.  I have a rare cancer and the king and short of it they had to remove the left side of my upper jaw and most of the roof of my mouth so my speech is not the best.  Strangers asked me why I spoke that way and after I tell them they immediately try to give medical advice. You are my hero!", "NTA and I think your response was perfect. She had as much right to your personal medical information as you did to hers. She was just too stupid to realize that's the point you were trying to make.\n\nRock on with your shiny broken spine!", "NTA. How could she call you perverted when she was asking about your sex life? She obviously didn\u2019t see you as equal to her and deserving of the respect she expected. She was disgusting and insulting and deserves to be taught how invasive it feels. It\u2019s sad that your friends aren\u2019t supportive they are not putting themselves in your position. They seem to be all about avoiding awkwardness, but sometimes people deserve to be made to feel awkward for the awful things they say. I bet she will think twice before doing it again to someone else! Good for you for sticking up for yourself although you should not have had to deal with that at all.", "NTA!", "NTA, and I love the way you handled it tbh. Hopefully next time she will keep her ignorant mouth shut.", "100% Justified AH, which automatically makes you NTA.", "Haha she fucked around and found out.  Fuck her and anyone that thinks it's ok to ask questions to people they dont know.", "NTA by a mile. Why do ables ask for the silliest things from us? I'm sorry you had to experience that but now I hope she thinks twice before asking invasive questions on a stranger.", "Nope NTA and this should become par the course when people ask invasive and personal questions when they have no right to that information. Your friends suck as well as anyone else who thought you should have just answered the questions or been more polite. She wasn't polite why should you have to be? Cause your paralyzed and all people are otherwise disabled in some form should be polite and friendly? That's a trash mentality to impose on people.", "NTA, and I think the go-to move here is always to ask people why or what they mean. If you keep at it long enough, she\u2019ll be forced to admit that either she thinks that disabled people are basically circus attractions and she has a right to gawk (including learning whatever she wants to know about you) or that she feels she is entitled to judge which disabilities are legitimate or not and then question or ridicule people who she deems unworthy of either their disability or accommodation. Occasionally, people like this also get the hint that they\u2019ve crossed a boundary and shut up.", "NTA. It could have been handled better, but the melt down would have been fun to watch. Next time just remember theres a difference between educating people, and invasion of privacy. You CAN say \"that is none of your business.\"", "NTA. She was sticking her fragile nose into shit that she had no business doing so.  Nice counter shot.", "Although hilarious,  next time I'd just stare her dead in the eyes and say \"How rude! \" Or something similar. \n\nWhen she reacts I'd then say \"It is extremely rude to ask a stranger about their sex life. Period. End of conversation.\"", "NTA OP. Good on you for standing up to the crazy lady. I feel kind of bad for her friends who obviously have Stockholm syndrome though.", "NTA. This made me laugh out loud. She didn\u2019t view you as a real person who deserves respect. That\u2019s why she can justify her rude behavior to herself. You just did the same thing. So petty. I love it.", "Nta she deserved every thing you gave her. She was appallingly rude and I can't believe her friends said you should have answered her.", "NTA\n\nAt all. And had she been mentally divergent and not all there, you still have the right to privacy and don't have to answer personal medical questions from total strangers.", "Absolutely NTA.\nThere are things that people need to understand about how to behave with others that she ignored. Your response fit her approach and since she had chosen to engage in to inquiry of most personal kind, she had at the time given her consent to be asked similar things.\n\nHer friends were assholes as well.\n\nHad you been a little angel you could have told her that you didn't want to discuss intimate matters with total strangers, but one should not demand angelic behaviour from us poor humans.", "Nta that is literally the BEST response!", "NTA. It must have felt good and it sucks that people around you are taking that away from you.", "NTA\n\nThat's it.\nGive yourself a hug from an internet stranger that would have cheered. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA but she and her friends are. Strangers are not your personal information-board. You are not obligated to answer questions about your life or condition. You only gave back. Good job!", "NTA. Good for you. Fast thinking. She and her friends were way out of line.", "Lol,  NTA you are my hero.", "NTA. Answering her would have emboldened her to do more.  Whether to you or others.

She asked you very personal questions and asked personal questions back. \n\nThe way you handled it, you are my this weekend\u2019s hero. Have a brilliant weekend yourself!", "NTA\u2014as they say on Law & Order, she opened the door to that line of questioning", "Oh you are soooooo NTA and well done for standing up to this awful entitled woman.

Turn it on her. \u201cWell you asked me very sexual and intimate questions, I thought it was quid pro quo. I thought you had a medical kink and were one of those folks I needed to run off.

Long story short, I\u2019m paralyzed from roughly the bra band down. I use a power wheelchair and have a service dog. I usually don\u2019t mind educating people about paralysis, access issues and chatting about my dog but this woman.. my dudes. She was rude, abrasive and *demanding.* She acted like she was entitled to my personal medical history. \n\nShe didn\u2019t even ask politely, just *demanded* to know how it happened, what the results were, if I tried X, Y, Z treatments, you name it. She even wanted to know about my sex life! Just.. seriously? Who asks this stuff of a literal stranger unfortunate enough to be eating delicious fair food at the table area? I just stared at her in shock as my delicious deep fried BBQ got cold. \n\nSo I smiled as politely as I could manage and this is where I *may* have been the asshole. I started to ask her about her last GYN visit. Were the stirrups too high, did she have to do that awkward shimmy/scoot down the table, if the speculum was cold, if the PAP smear hurt, the usual. If she felt entitled to my answers, I should be entitled to her answers, right? \n\nWell, she threw an absolute fucking fit. Started screaming and yelling that I was gross and a pervert and on and on and on. Her group tried to calm her down and one of them told me I should\u2019ve just been polite and answered her questions. As far as I could tell this woman wasn\u2019t impaired in any way. She didn\u2019t have a carer or minder, she was with a group of friends and had been carrying in normally with them until she saw me. I got to the table, asked it the space was free and set up at the end of the table because my chair fits neatly on the end of one piece picnic benches. \n\nI told the group that if she wanted my personal and private medical information then she should trade info for info. Two of the people called me an asshole when they left, trying to calm down their nearly \u201chysterical\u201d friend as they left. She was still screaming and shouting how I was a perv/cruel/mean. People were staring at me and I hated it. \n\nAt the time I felt good for finally finding a shiny, new (but still broken) spine and standing up for myself. So to speak. I was talking to friends last night and they said I was an asshole, I could\u2019ve politely told her I wasn\u2019t going to tell her. I tried that when she came over and demanded answers, not even asked for them. \n\nSo reddit, I\u2019m asking here. Am I the asshole for not divulging my medical info and asking her about hers?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(We often played on the floor with me either laying or sitting on cushions). He would want to rub cream in my back 'to help my poorly back'. As he got older he'd ask more involved questions to u derstand why it happened or what caused it etc. One day we were getting into a lift and I had my sticks and he started telling the people in the lift the story of how I have a poorly back and can't walk far and the sticks help me. Lol. It's like he was wanting to educate them too. I have no problem if a kid asks me why I use a mobility aid, or I hear them ask their mum etc. It can be that some kids only see elderly people use them, and aren't aware that there's reasons younger people may need them too. I'm happy to explain it to them. But to have a grown adult rudely ask personal and invasive questions, almost doubting that you have a reason to use a wheelchair etc is just not on. It's perfectly acceptable to match their attitude and rudeness. Esp when they ignore your request to politely stop asking personal questions. Some people don't feel comfortable explaining to strangers why they use a wheelchair. They could feel embarrassed about using it and their judgement makes it even worse. It can also be difficult when someone is rude about why you use a wheelchair, but can stand up at times like getting in and out the car. They don't understand there's such a thing as ambulatory wheelchair users. They think everyone in a wheelchair is either paralysed or an amputee. I personally use a wheelchair for chronic pain, and also due to using oxygen for 2 years after having severe covid. I can stand and walk in and out my bungalow at times when the pain is manageable, but use a wheelchair outside the house to enable me to go further as I wouldn't be able to walk far in pain. But when my back flares up worse and kicks off my severe sciatica, I can barely stand or get from bed to bathroom. People don't always understand using mobility aids to ease pain or to enable them to do more things. \nThis woman was out of order.
