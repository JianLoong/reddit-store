My OB was horrified my husband was FIFO for work when I was 36 weeks pregnant with our first; as it happened he arrived home at week 37 and my waters broke that night.  You need to have a serious conversation about your husband and the consequences of him possibly missing the birth.  Not to mention missing the last few days of just being your own little family before the baby comes.  What is really going on?  Is he having cold feet about fatherhood?  Is he suddenly realising his life is about to change and he\u2019s freaking out?  Is he just immature and irresponsible?

He might think your due date in a couple of weeks is some magical day you\u2019re definitely going to deliver on. \n\nBut the end of a pregnancy is a really tenuous even dangerous time for a woman. You need help and you need support. Tell him if he goes you\u2019re going to go stay with a friend or relative. I hope you have someone nearby. And do it.

Uber or a taxi isn't a good idea, it's not the uber driver's job to support you if you're in labor, or deal with things if the baby comes quickly, while you are still in their car.  An ambulance is expensive, and usually not necessary.\n\nThere is always, also, the more extreme option of calling the friends he's supposed to travel with, explain that you are pregnant and very close to your due date, and would they be able to drive him home if you went into labor, or make sure he's sober enough to get home and drive you?  He may not have mentioned this little complication to his friends while planning, and odds are good that at least one of them will be horrified. \n\nBut tell him you need a plan, in writing, with contact phone numbers for anyone he's expecting to help out, for exactly how he's planned to meet his responsibilities as your husband and your child-to-be's father, if he is five hours away and you go into labor or have an emergency.", "And there I was all set to say you were the asshole because you can't expect someone to not do something just because you're pregnant, and then it turns out you could expel the thing at any given sneeze and yeah...\n\n\nNTA", "NTA why did you marry this dude?

If this was planned out, he should have told you in advance. You're close to your due date, I don't think it is inconceivable that you could go into labor early. It is four days so I'm not sure of the likelihood of that happening. Its almost like he's betting on the odds that something won't happen but even betting on such odds there is still the chance no matter how small that something COULD happen in which case he should be there for you. If you've been respectful in the past of him having time by himself etc, then I think it is important for him to understand the vulnerability you're in at this stage of the pregnancy and suck it up and miss out on the weekend with the boys.
