My OB was horrified my husband was FIFO for work when I was 36 weeks pregnant with our first; as it happened he arrived home at week 37 and my waters broke that night.  You need to have a serious conversation about your husband and the consequences of him possibly missing the birth.  Not to mention missing the last few days of just being your own little family before the baby comes.  What is really going on?  Is he having cold feet about fatherhood?  Is he suddenly realising his life is about to change and he\u2019s freaking out?  Is he just immature and irresponsible?

He might think your due date in a couple of weeks is some magical day you\u2019re definitely going to deliver on. \n\nBut the end of a pregnancy is a really tenuous even dangerous time for a woman. You need help and you need support. Tell him if he goes you\u2019re going to go stay with a friend or relative. I hope you have someone nearby. And do it.

Uber or a taxi isn't a good idea, it's not the uber driver's job to support you if you're in labor, or deal with things if the baby comes quickly, while you are still in their car.  An ambulance is expensive, and usually not necessary.\n\nThere is always, also, the more extreme option of calling the friends he's supposed to travel with, explain that you are pregnant and very close to your due date, and would they be able to drive him home if you went into labor, or make sure he's sober enough to get home and drive you?  He may not have mentioned this little complication to his friends while planning, and odds are good that at least one of them will be horrified. \n\nBut tell him you need a plan, in writing, with contact phone numbers for anyone he's expecting to help out, for exactly how he's planned to meet his responsibilities as your husband and your child-to-be's father, if he is five hours away and you go into labor or have an emergency.", "And there I was all set to say you were the asshole because you can't expect someone to not do something just because you're pregnant, and then it turns out you could expel the thing at any given sneeze and yeah...\n\n\nNTA", "NTA why did you marry this dude?

It is four days so I'm not sure of the likelihood of that happening.

If - and I can only guess - he wants to go on the trip because he can he seriously needs to be talked some sense into his head.", " Ta show him this thread.   Hopefully he is just oblivious and not a malicious jerk.", "I went in for a scheduled induction. Ended up there was life threatening complications that resulted in having to have an emergency C Section almost immediately after I was admitted. Between being admitted to the hospital (where we didn\u2019t think anything was wrong) and wheeled back to the OR my husband had gone down to get our bags from the car. He left our room and everything was ok and then came back to chaos. It was that fast. He almost missed the birth of our son because he was a gentleman, wanted to see me settled in my room and then go get our bags. OP, your husband is an idiot.", "NTA and you need to lay it out crystal clear that if he leaves and something happens while he's off galavanting you will *never* forgive him. His choice will irreparably harm your relationship. Is his friend and this trip worth that to him?\n\n\nAlso, start building a safety net *now* of friends and family who you can reach out to for support if needed. Hell, even your in-laws might be willing to help you if shit hits the fan.", "You are NTA but your husband is.", "What the heck? I mean he just doesn't care about you at all, that's the only possible explanation. You won't be able to get him to see why this is wrong, because he doesn't care. He doesn't care if you have to give birth alone, if there are complications, if you are scared, he doesn't care about you. NTA, obviously. But you can't make him love you.", "NTA. He needs time for himself when you are about to give birth? You can't get him to understand because he doesn't care. There's no way he's going to be a reliable partner in parenting if he can't even bother to be there for you now. I'd suggest giving him lots of time for himself by handing him divorce papers. He's useless. You deserve better than this.", "NTA. Dude, I never even MADE it to 38 weeks with either viable pregnancy! DS came at 35 weeks, DD came at 37. You could go into labor at any time and he wants to take a chance on missing it for a friend's trip?!?", "NTA- why would he plan a 4 day trip knowing ur closer to the due date? Like what made him he should agree to such an idea ?? It\u2019s so bizzare", "NTA. 38 weeks is all hands on deck and standby at all times. No way he should be 5 hours away unless 100000% life or death.", "NTA. If you went into labor, it wouldn\u2019t even be considered early. I had my first at 39 weeks. My second at 38 weeks. You said you are already 38 weeks and the trip is in a few days? Then he\u2019ll be gone for 4 MORE days?? He\u2019s seriously pushing it and it\u2019s completely understandable and expected that you\u2019re upset he\u2019s okay with that risk.", "NTA! Alright people of Reddit, let\u2019s go take care of this woman since her useless, git of a husband is incapable. We will need a cleaning crew to get the house ship shape, a cooking crew for meals to throw in the freezer, drivers to get her to the hospital & back home, a few supportive moms to help her through birth if family is not close.", "Someone who thinks babies arrive on schedule, like well run trains, and not whenever they damn well please, like a wizard.", "I agree. But I bet he is also the type of person that if he is \u201cforced\u201d to stay and OP doesn\u2019t give birth during the time he would have been gone, he will always keep bringing up how OP made him cancel his trip for nothing.\n\nI think OP is in a no-win situation. The only way husband wouldn\u2019t be intolerable is if he goes on the trip and she gives birth without him.\n\nRegardless, OP is NTA", "A person\u2026.who doesn\u2019t like their partner", "OP needs to tell her husband she has done 100% of the work of growing a full ass human being, and her body will be the one badly damaged getting it out.  His ONLY job right now and only way he can contribute and support the baby is to be there to help her at the very end and very worst part of the pregnancy and make damn sure he is there for the birth when she desperately needs her support person.  It's not just about possibly missing the birth, this part of the pregnancy is hard and she needs help.", "An absolute A H goes camping 5 hours away while their wife is 38 weeks pregnant.\n\nI delivered at 38 weeks. You are definitely NTA, OP.", "Yeah. This would be my take. Explain exactly how it makes you feel that he chooses not to be around at such a late stage of your pregnancy. Then decide what you\u2019re going to do as a consequence of his action. I like this idea of choosing a new birth partner. Someone you can count on.", "I agree, as its clear that seeing his child being born is clearly not the husband's priority.", "Preferably a cute guy your husband doesn't like.", "I didn't even make it to 38 weeks with my first (37 weeks 4 days) \nThis guy has no idea what is in store.", "Use the time that he\u2019s gone to get a lawyer and file for divorce.  You won\u2019t be happy parenting with this man.", ">but at 38 weeks, def not.\n\nExactly this. My son was born at 38 weeks, my daughter at 35 weeks. With son, my first sign of labor was when my water broke. Kid had the hiccups and broke the sac, then the contractions hit. Total time until delivery was only 3 hours, 42 minutes. Had my ex not been home (which was a close call, he was in the car preparing to leave), I might have ended up delivering at home while awaiting anyone else to make it to me, which could have had serious repercussions due to complications after birth. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA. I would honestly leave at that point and stay with friends or family who support me. He doesn't seem to care if he misses the birth or if anything horrible happens and he isn't there to help. You gotta take care of yourself and your baby because he won't. \n\nI'm so sorry that you have this stress added to your life :(", "This ^ \nI'm 34 weeks pregnant and my husband works an hour away. We've already started coming up with plans on what to do if I go into labor while he's at work.", "It\u2019s quite sad that the \u201csomeone who loves and cares about you\u201d is not the husband.\n\nBut I agree with what you said, and I hope OP sees this.\n\nNTA.\n\nThe husband is.", "What? Just because someone wants to go on a trip doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be present?", "I\u2019m not making any suggestions for OP\u2018s relationship. But if somebody did this to me? They would be gifted with with plenty of time for themselves. Lots and lots.", "She is consider full term right now and can give birth at any time, babies have their own time clock and come out when they are ready in most cases. Edited to add this: my first had a complication that we didn't know was occuring I gave birth to him at 32 weeks. My husband had just gotten off a long term out of state assignment at 30 weeks. Where would I have been if he wasn't home?", "Extra points if she annoys the shitknuckles out of him.", "There really shouldn\u2019t be more to this.  38 weeks means it could be any minute.", "There\u2019s really not. You are at term at 37 weeks. Both of my children came between 38 and 39 weeks. And even a first labor can be very short.", "40 weeks is from the date of the uterus owner's last period, not conception. 37 weeks is considered full term. Due dates and when a person is going to have the baby are pretty much a guess until labour starts, or there are complications that make the due date anywhere between right now and a scheduled c section or induction. So the expected term length is anywhere between last week and 3 weeks from now.", "Full term is 37 weeks. Babies don\u2019t give a shit about their due date", "What trains are you riding that are 100% on time lol?", "Seems like the most accurate (and completely infuriating) answer. \n\nOP: NTA. But this is a red flag. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Someone having an affair", "NTA. Same story. First kid born at 38 weeks completely unexpectedly. Barely made it to the hospital before she arrived. Him camping five hours away is a huge red flag. :(", "It\u2019s definitely a sign of things to come.  I\u2019m sure this is an annual boys will be boys trip he\u2019ll be taking every year.", "He's willing to potentially miss the birth of his child. He's okay with not being present. So yeah, this is definitely a sign of things to come. She's about to POP.", "No, but it shows that he's not prioritizing his wife and unborn child. \nMy husband took vacation time starting two weeks before the due date. His work was a 10-minute drive away. I went overdue by a week both times and he had never ever made feel bad or guilty about this because as far as he was concerned, I needed his full attention. \nThat's what a real partner does.", "Yep\u2026.i think that\u2019s justified too\n\nI don\u2019t have suggestions either as it\u2019s a tough one.  Putting her foot down doesn\u2019t solve the problem.    It has to be his decision but if he is too selfish to see that, then that\u2019s unlikely", "Same here. They\u2019d have all the time in the world to figure it out. And an empty house to do it in.", "Well it's hard to make excuses to get away to affair partner when you have a new baby at home. Better get some extra time in before the birth", "Y\u2019all jump into crazy accusations just because someone wants to go on a trip.", "But do you know that? Saying that someone will be a deadbeat because they took a trip BEFORE the baby was born is ridiculous. If she was wanting to take a girls trip and her husband was going on Reddit, everyone would be saying he was TA.", "I know we on Reddit like to jump into the extremes sometimes, but I think sometimes it\u2019s also justified. At his age, and I\u2019m also 36 so right there too, 38 weeks is like \u2018I\u2019m gonna have a kid like any minute here\u2019. He should know that, I know that, everyone knows that. He\u2019s literally saying \u201cI guess I\u2019d rather fuck off than care for my extremely pregnant wife\u201d, I don\u2019t understand how he doesn\u2019t see it this way. My brain can\u2019t work this one out.\n\nNTA, OP", "Or he\u2019ll be the one doing the diaper and formula runs, and the first store was out so he had to go to the second one\u2026", "It's not really about the trip it's the timing and lack of interest or care the husband is showing for OPs concerns...Affair may be a jump but it's not outside the realm of possibility."]}
