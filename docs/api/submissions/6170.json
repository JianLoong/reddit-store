We stayed with them a month, my wife and I had our own bedroom. \n\nMy parents at first only wanted to see me. They slowly started asking how my wife was doing and things like that. When I would see them briefly on Christmases they would send a small gift for my wife. One day out of the blue my parents invited us both to a Thanksgiving dinner. Obviously it\u2019s been years. It was disastrous to say the least. My father blindsided us and started saying that we needed to end things and implied that if we didn\u2019t my wife would get sick and I would too and his god was telling him this. Things got heated and I made it understood that if it came down to it I would always pick her and I had no issue never speaking to them again. The following day my father apologized to the both of us. Just this passed month they told me a cousin I haven\u2019t spoken to in over 20 years wants to have a reunion for family next Thanksgiving and they\u2019re renting a cabin and want me to join because I\u2019m family.

I did not see them again until 8 years later when our son was born. Then after years of playing nice, when he was 8, we traveled to them for Christmas... my son and I were rough housing... he had been in martial arts for 2 years thus far... and I accidentally slipped and hit him in the ribs and he started crying. I didn't think anything of it. They started acting weird for the entire week we were there. When we were leaving, I overheard the FiL say to my wife, \"if you need anything, call, and i will fly right up\". I was like the detective at the end of The Usual Suspects. As soon as I heard him say that, I flashed back and it hit me... they were treating me like I was abusive that entire week. I was beside myself. The kid liked to rough house... he started it all of the time even though occasionally it could hurt.. both of us for that matter. As long as it wasnt my face, i wanted him to know how to hit full force rather than just sparring in class. So, I let him hit me. He'll, part of learning bo staff was getting used to snapping it against your own arm... and to teach him that you could tough it out, I let him hit me in the arm with it and told him that he would get tired and stop before I made him stop... He was a tough kid that has grown into a tough adult. \n\n\nAnyways, I guess at least I got out of having to go to the in-laws ever again, and that was 13 years ago.", "I did.

The only way the parents are not AHs is if they don't have any place to put OP and her wife together.
