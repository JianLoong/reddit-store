We stayed with them a month, my wife and I had our own bedroom. \n\nMy parents at first only wanted to see me. They slowly started asking how my wife was doing and things like that. When I would see them briefly on Christmases they would send a small gift for my wife. One day out of the blue my parents invited us both to a Thanksgiving dinner. Obviously it\u2019s been years. It was disastrous to say the least. My father blindsided us and started saying that we needed to end things and implied that if we didn\u2019t my wife would get sick and I would too and his god was telling him this. Things got heated and I made it understood that if it came down to it I would always pick her and I had no issue never speaking to them again. The following day my father apologized to the both of us. Just this passed month they told me a cousin I haven\u2019t spoken to in over 20 years wants to have a reunion for family next Thanksgiving and they\u2019re renting a cabin and want me to join because I\u2019m family. No mention of my wife because it still doesn\u2019t seem to sink in that they are extended family and my immediate family is who I spend the holidays with. \n\nThat is the difference between true acceptance and forced tolerance. \n\nI do not owe my parents the grace of seeing me with strings attached. As neither of you owe it to them.", "NTA-They need to treat you the same as BIL/SIL. You have children together & sleep in the same bed at home. It'd be confusing on your children if you weren't sleeping in the same bed/room. They In-laws need to accept your relationship as is sounds like you've been together for almost 10 years.", "NTA\n\nYou just wanted to sleep in the same room for crying out loud. Y'all are married and should be allowed to stay in the same room overnight.\n\nI would have done the same thing! And no, you are not selfish or petty for removing your children and wife from that situation!", "Your mother-in-law is a homophobic jerk. You were 100 percent in the right. I strongly suggest you show her this subreddit.", "NTA.  Did your FIL and BIL realize MIL wanted you two in separate bedrooms?  Or are they homophobic too?  That is nuts.  You are married, your gender should not matter.  Heck your kids know you sleep together.  Also does she not realize people of the same sex do share beds sometimes who are not romantically involved and don't have sex.  They are all out of their minds.", "NTA \n\nYour in-laws are bigots, and you should have said more.", "NTA. Period.", "NTA...dont go back. These people are just wrong.", "Gaslighting much\n\nNTA\n\nTotally and dellibreately disrespectfull, and then pretending you were overreacting. \n\nThey dont like you, and i assume its mutual, but they clearly want to see their daughter and grandchildren. This means they have quite a bit more to loose than you. Dont take their shit.", "NTA\n\nThe obvious homophobia aside, my friends parents tried to pull the same thing with her and her long time boyfriend.  She pointed out her boyfriend has been committed to her for 12 years while her sisters have all been through multiple divorces and are currently allowed to share a bedroom with their new spouses who have been around for less than a quarter of the length of her relationship.  They were allowed to share a room that night.", "I'm M, wife is F.\n\nMy FIL tried that with us. My wife told him, that's fine. It didn't stop us from having sex then, it won't now.\n\nWas and still is the funniest thing ever.", "NTA. It sounds like your in-laws are jealous bigots and need to a good smack up side the head with the respect other people stick.", "NTA in laws are homophobic. Keep distance from them.", " NTA.   It's always appropriate to call out homophobia.", "Nta at all. You don't have to put up with her blatant homophobia", "Oh! I had to go back and re read that they were a same sex couple to figure out what was going on.  You now know not to ever agree with staying in their home again,  and keeping contact low, right? It's all about pretending their daughter is not a lesbian and you are just a \"friend \". They are just run of the mill homophobes. Good for you for leaving.", "NTA.\n\nI'm glad your wife sees this the same way. The in-laws are well on their way to having a poor relationship with their daughter as they get older.", "NTA. Are you sure your in laws dislike you personally or are they just biased and terrible?", "NTA ohhh I've seen this one before, and your better not negotiate with terrorists, give them a single opening, like agreeing to sleep on another room and you're gonna end up being introduced as \"wife's roommate\", they want to see your family? They have to respect your family, you and your wife deserve better than being treated as a second class family", "Someone should check with the BIL, though. He might be homophobic for sure, but who knows what the MIL/FIL told him. The way he got upset about the size of the house feels really irrelevant because the only reason to be upset the house isn't a mansion is if they *didn't* have enough space. OP asking to sleep in one room is really asking to downsize their footprint. \n\nI could totally picture the MIL/FIL calling up the BIL and not being truthful about the situation and/or being willfully ignorant about their behavior. \"I don't know why they left, I guess OP doesn't like it in our house? We were just trying to make it comfortable for them. OP was upset at the rooms we provided, I don't know what she was saying.\"", "This is so hard, women hurting women, for no reason other than loving the same person! \ud83d\ude1e", "Not inviting them at all is more homophobic. Come on now. Hyperbole has a time and place.", "I wish OP called  MIL out on her bigotry as she left. Since she seemed \"confused\" as to why OP and wife left instead of staying.\n\n\nNTA OP. Disrespectful, Homophobic grandparents don't get to see grandchildren.", "Also don't let BIL get away with that \"because it's not a mansion\"-crap. Set him straight (lol) and explain that it is the bigotry and only the bigotry, nothing else but the bigotry.", "Why didn't other couples get the same level of disrespectful treatment when you and your wife probably had enough of it. Hats off to your wife who stood behind you.", "Problem is they want to see less of OP while still having a relationship with her wife and kids. OP\u2019s wife needs to be the one to step up and and keep the kids away from her parents.", "Well put!!", "No. Fundamentalists or Southern Baptists wouldn't have even invited them in the first place.", "Brazenly admitting to being homophobic really isn\u2019t the move", "And the more the MiL tells her 'version' of what happened the more she believes it & it becomes the [Missing, Missing Reasons](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html) for MiL.\"Oh, woe is me, I provided perfectly acceptable accomodation & they turned their nose up at it. Why doesn't my DiL be reasonable & like me?\"", "It always comes down to either skin colour or sexuality when the hypocrites start crawling out", "Same, the inlaws not liking OP also starts to make sense more now", "[removed]", "Appropriate for who? Does she think the grandbabies don't know their moms are a couple? Is she worried FIL is a perv who will lie awake thinking of his daughter and dil (I feel physically nauseous typing that). Who was this supposed to be \"appropriate\" for. I feel like theres a \"think of the children\" wail coming but she doesn't even have that leg to stand on.", "Exactly. I think there's a problem that's rooted much deeper than shared / not shared accommodation. It's  good old homophobia, and in case the relationship with the inlaws is supposed to be continued, that issue needs to be addressed. You can't raise 2 children and just overlook the fact that their grandparents don't respect the marriage. There's only 2 adult ways out of there - confronting them or cutting them off.", "Bot.

Acceptance in time in OP's case may have been a possibility, but she went scorched Earth and probably killed any possibility of it. Expecting instant acceptance ignores the reality that beliefs are not choices.\n\n\nWhat I remind people is that beliefs are not chosen. There is a strong irony that OP understands her sexuality isn't a belief she can choose to change, but she is oblivious that her in-laws beliefs are also not something they can choose to change. As parents, I'm sure they'd love to be able to accept their daughter completely, but the best they can do is try to influence themselves to change their beliefs. It's a gradual process that OP doesn't grasp.\n\n\nAsk someone to tell you the food they absolute hate. Offer them $100 to choose to believe it's their favorite food.

Some can be changed with a news report, others require long term human interaction. Former bigots' opinions are usually changed by long term exposure with the people they didn't accept."]}
