If he accepts, tell him you'll adjust plans for him and because of his sacrifice.\n\nIf he accepts AND then he still gets to room with his spouse, point out the hypocrisy.\n\nOffer the same arrangement to the FIL-- him and his wife can sleep in separate rooms and give you their room.\n\nYou're NTA for expecting to be able to room with your spouse, and especially if your wife is on your side about the matter.\n\n>I told my wife and she said it was outrageous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, something to keep in mind. No matter what you do, you're always going to be the AH to your inlaws. You acknowledge this in your opening paragraphs. Might be time to sit down and talk to your wife about why she allows them to treat you this way and where the line is on how much punishment they can continue to dish out without response.\n\nI have a similar relationship with my inlaws. I work to keep the peace but my wife has fallen further away from her parents because of how they've treated me. Not because of anything I've done. (They are hard core catholic. My wife has fallen away from Catholicism. I have never been Catholic. And despite trying to honor her upbringing, and their beliefs, I am not good enough for them.) If they cannot see that making her spouse (you) unhappy is going to make her unhappy, then they do not deserve her in their lives. And if your wife is willing to tolerate the rudeness towards yourself and the disrespect to the life choices she's made (in choosing you), then I'd (personally) start to wonder just how strong that marital bond was.\n\nYou don't have to present it as an ultimatum. Simply explain how going to visit your in laws and being belittled and treated like an outsider hurts you. If you have to put on a brave front so that she is not further hurt, spell it out for her. Let your wife fill in her own response. Decide from there what you both want going forward. There are multiple options, including her explaining to her family that they can no longer abuse you if they want her and her family in their lives; or cutting ties completely; or maybe she doesn't care about how it makes you feel and you have to do some soul searching about that.\n\nYMMV.
