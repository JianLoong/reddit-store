Your inlaws are homophobes. By you leaving, they were forced to confront their own bad behaviour. But its easier to blame you than to admit that they're in the wrong.", "NTA  \nThis is very clearly about their female daughter sharing a room with her female wife. I see no other reason to set things up like this. Especially when you were told it was \"appropriate\". If that's the case, BIL and SIL and sleep separately from their SO's too. \n\nI see nothing wrong with what you did. You were disrespected, you didn't like it. Instead of arguing, you pack up your stuff and left.", "Let's see: \n\n1. you're married with 2 kids,\n\n2. the house has 5 rooms, and\n\n3. all the heterosexual couples share a room.\n\nNTA. Don't coddle bigots.", "NTA - keep your kids away from that homophobic toxicity.      \nKids are smart and pick up more than some people realise, they will know their grandparents treat your marriage differently", "NTA. and i am happy that your wife has also sided with you. This is what having arealtionship with healthy conversation look like. Please don't reply to the family, let your wife handle it. Only gets involved if it is necessary.", "NTA your inlaws are petty and spiteful. I would go full non contact.", "NTA, how can you doubt", "NTA. You did good & stood up for yourself.", "NTA, but honestly unless you can convince your wife to cut your parents out of her life, you will be dealing with this type of behavior for the rest of your marriage. You maybe should talk about how you are going to deal with them going into the new year.", "NTA. They messed themselves around, you're married, you have children together, there is no longer anything inappropriate about you sleeping in the same bed. MIL just couldn't get past her bigotry and everyone suffered for it. I hope she found it worth it!", "NTA - she's treating you differently from SIl/BIL. She just doesn't accept your marriage. You were right to sleep somewhere else.", "NTA.  It is bizarre in the extreme that anyone would want you to sleep in a different room when you are married. Either the in-laws just don't \"get\" the whole concept of marriage...or they were being deliberately obtuse, just to fuck with you.", "NTA. Rules only work if they are enforced for everyone. If no couples were allowed to sleep together and it was clearly communicated ahead of time that is one thing. Or even only married couples(weird but their house). But I'm pretty sure we all know they are just being homophobic AHs especially considering your married and they tried to pull a fast one by only disclosing sleeping arrangements that night. I guarantee they knew it would be an issue. I'm sorry you had to go though that.\n\nEdit: you may want to be careful how much your kids get exposed to people would would disrespect your relationship like that. You don't want them teaching your kids.", "NTA. Your in-laws are treating you, as a married couple, differently than the straight BIL and SIL. This is homophobic. It\u2019s inexcusable and disrespectful; you were right to leave.", "I think NTA. If your parents are t comfortable with you SLEEPING in the same bed as your partner you shouldn\u2019t have to stay in their house.", "NTA. As usual, the people who were petty and selfish tried to turn it around as if someone else was the problem. They were unpleasant before this incident and went out of their way to make you feel unwelcome. They really shouldn't be surprised if they see you even less in future.", "NTA They have found that there is a limit to the shit you will both put up with. They sound like awful people.", "NTA. At least now you know how overt their homophobia is. Glad you and your wife seem to be on the same page, plus you\u2019re teaching your kids appropriate and healthy boundaries. No one (regardless of relation) can treat people badly and feel entitled to their time.", "Nope, NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. They clearly don't approve your relationship and expect you to be fine with them disrespecting you. Tell them the truth:\" I will respect you enough to let you see your grandchildren when you respect me enough to accept my relationship with your daughter.\"", "Lmfao how many guest rooms does you MIL have? Must be a big ass mansion.", "Info: Do MIL/FIL share a room?", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhy do they dislike you? Do they have a reason other than homophobia? Not that it matters for the verdict.

It doesn't matter anyway, my answer would be the same....\n\nNTA. All the other married couples shared a room, so what makes you any different??", "NTA. If it was supposedly good enough for you and your wife why was no other couple treated with the same level of discourtesy. Kudos to your wife for having your back. NTA", "That's f'd up on their part. Go full non-contact. Totally NYA", "NTA they are preventing themselves from seeing their daughter and grandchildren by being bigots.", "NTA\n\nI understand (to a certain extent) that for cultural/religious/traditional reasons some people do not like it when unmarried couples share a room in their home. But spouses who live together AND have kids? Come on give me a break. Then to top it all off, they have the audacity to send you those messages.\nYou and your wife should both sit down xour in-laws and make it very clear that if they want to see any part of your family (incl. their daughter) ever again, they need a thorough attitude adjustment.", "NTA. They were the ones who decided that being homophobic was more important than seeing their grandkids.", "Let me guess; inlaws are Fundamentalists or Southern Baptists. NTA.", "NTA. Your wife's family sound like the type of people you'd want to keep your kids away from.  I feel you and your partner should cut them off", "NTA. You were being treated unfairly. They chased you away from their home if anything.", "NTA. Selfish & petty is when you try to force a married couple to conform to the sort of rules used for unwed couples. If your FIL & MIL don't like the consequences of their petty selfishness, maybe they should make less offensive decisions going forward. Your BIL needs to remove himself entirely from the conversation, because it's none of his business in any way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
