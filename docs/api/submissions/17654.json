Your brother is right, he and Angel are both adults. And Angel can choose whether or not to take your advice. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nAlso: I always find it useful never to pick up the phone for someone who calls during work (or school) hours or who calls repeatedly if I don't answer. Because that is the certain sign of someone who feels entitled to push and scream at you.\n\nDon't engage with them. Let them stew in their juices.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nGood for you! And good for Angel for actually listening to you!", "NTA I had a toxic ex whose family knew it and I wish someone would have warned me.", "Nta I would go further and ask family why they ignored what happened to your friend and if they do not know the story, fill them in. \nAs a friend you did a right thing. Luke seems to be a predator , moving to you to be closer to his new victim. Kind of creepy even. \nFor all those with pretenses- tell you called spade a spade", "NTA.  I'd tell the family that as soon as you say something untrue then you'll be happy to apologize but everything you've said so fair is truthful so deal with it.", "NTA. 10 screaming calls kind of proves your point!", "NTA - your brother sure is.  Why is he preying on your friends who are years younger than him?  That's just creepy.  Tell him to stay in his lane and to stay away from your friends.", "An honest heads up is usually okay. NTA.", "NTA all you did was provide info, Angel made up his own mind to avoid your brother once given that info.", "NTA, tell all of the people calling you about your brother too.", "NTA your friend asked and you warned him off.  pretty straight forward. your brother's blowing up at you just confirms the abusive nature.", "I agree. But also I don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t be in contact with his friend now that he\u2019s an independent adult. Personally I would rather go NC with a shitty sibling than a friend who has done nothing wrong.", "It sounded to me like the friend was so traumatised by what the brother did, that he no longer can be around OP because of the brother and/memories of everything.", "NTA\n\nYou reminded me a lot of my childhood friend and her older brother.  She was abused by her brother (the dude purposely whacked her head into a table when she was a few months old and she still has the scar & dent as an adult).  Hell the guy tried to attack me when I was a kid!  Yet the family \"couldn't see it\".  When the brother got engaged, my best friend arranged to meet this girl and let her know what he did to her, me and other people in his life.  The girl discussed some \"red flags\" she wasn't sure about which friend confirmed was the start of the behavior of past girlfriends.  She dumped him and thanked my best friend so many times for helping her.  Unfortunately the family reacted similar to yours, if not worse.  Best friend moved across the country to get away from those a-holes.  Happy ending though; bestie is studying to be a doctor, has a long-term partner who treats her well and is no longer living in fear.  We get together online every couple weeks to play games & catch up.\n\nI'm sure Angel appreciated having honesty and someone who cares about their well being.  Thank you for not letting your friend get hurt.  As for your family, you may need to distance yourself for awhile. Definitely distance yourself from your brother for your own safety and mental well being.", "NTA \n\nYes because a totally not abusive person calls 10+ times and verbally abuses the person who warned an innocent party about said abusive person....\n\nIf Angel listened to you it's because of 1 of 3 reasons \n\nHe trusts your judgement of your own brother \n\nHe has already seen some possible red flags \n\nHe holds his standards high enough to not even find out IF what you said is true or not (which by all accounts sounds like you're right about your brother)", "NTA; you\u2019re a good friend and I wish more men were like you (willing to tell on the abusers in their lives)", "NTA You have every right to tell the truth to anyone you want. Your brother doesn't want you spouting the truth, tough. He doesn't like the truth, change it.", "NTA but you also need to tell all of your family what Luke does to his boyfriends. What he has already done to your friends who dated him then be prepared for every one to call you a liar. You should also go no contact with Luke completely so this doesn\u2019t keep happening to your friends.", "Everyone is saying NTA but we don\u2019t even know if what OP saying is true. It\u2019s very odd when EVERYONE except OP thinks his brother is a good person. I\u2019d be interested in knowing what he\u2019s done that makes him so bad. For all we know OP may just be exaggerating or making him look worse than he is for whatever reason.\n\nBut if everything OP said is true then he\u2019s in the greenligjt", "INFO:\n\nWhat has your brother actually done? It's difficult to judge given we only have your word to go on that he was abusive.", "NTA - You warned your friend and gave the best information you could. Angel is an adult and didn\u2019t have to listen to you if he didn\u2019t want to. He clearly trusts your judgement, and you might\u2019ve really saved him from some pain and heartache.", "OP: Brother is abusive.\nBrother while screaming: I'M NOT ABUSIVE\n\nObviously NTA", "You did not lie.  you wanted your friend about potential abusive.\n\nYou endured this through HS.  Did Luke ever apologize for what he did to your friend?\n\nNTA\n\nYou did Angel a favor.", "NTA and you don't owe anyone an apology. Additionally, since Angel is your roommate AND asked for your input, you are extra \"in the clear\". Your brother could have jeopardized your housing situation.", "NTA. Proud of you for telling Angel just how Luke is. I can only imagine what would have happened if you had not warned him and something happened. Glad to see people like you exist to help others stop making terrible mistakes.", "Agreed. NTA. I wish someone had been able to warn me about my abusive exes. You did the right thing OP.", "Yeah it's not a good look that he was screaming through the phone. Doesn't say \"well adjusted person\" to me.", "it seems like the friend did head the warning, the brother was the one to call and yell at op cause he warned his friend", "My brother is an abusive ass. He's VERY good at playing the victim and getting women to think that he's just had a rough go of things and SHE will be the one to help him get his life in order. And then when it turns abusive, they seem to always think they are the only one he treated that way. My brother's current wife is basically begging people to take him off her hands. \n\nIt took until now, he's in his 40s, for most people to finally stop enabling him. I've even heard people say that they think he JUST got bad. He's been abusive for 25 years+ and most family members/friends are just now seeing it. \n\nI 100% believe the brother. There's no reason to say his brother treats partners poorly if he doesn't.", "he was both physically and emotionally abusive to my ex bestfriend  \"Aaron\"., He'd be super possessive over Aaron . Called him all the time and get so mad at Aaron if he talked to other guys and Aaron used to blame alot of his injuries on \"soccer accidents\"", "Thanks for the info, OP.\n\nSince I've no reason to distrust you, I'll join the NTA consensus.", "yes....", "NTA\n\nYou did the best you could by warning your friend. Sadly, it sounds like they'll start seeing each other and you will suffer for it.\n\nLet them do whatever they want, just excuse yourself from supporting them. Because you know your friend will come crying to you once they are mistreated by your brother.\n\nBut if you try to keep them apart, it will strengthen their bond and they'll be stronger together to try and prove you wrong. Which usually means it'll be much much worse when it finally ends, because they put up with being mistreated due to shame.", "NTA. On the contrary, you've been a good friend to Angel. You did the right thing, and I'm sorry that you're getting blowback for it.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good friend.", "NTA you did a great thing for Angel. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA. You didn't say anything that was untrue. Your brother uses your life like a hunting ground, and leaves you to deal with the fall out. He's abusive and predatory.", "NTA\n\nBaby boy, you made the right call. For all we know, you may have prevented a chain of events leading to death.\n\nI've seen people getting lynched to death by their abusive partners, some die of depression and grief, and many other things\n\nAnd you also saved your friendship\n\nYour brother on the other hand is TA", "NTA. You did the right thing by warning him about your brother. I would've tried to do the same thing", "This. But, also, OP, I would distance yourself from your brother. If you can't trust he won't prey on your friends, I wouldn't have him around your friends.", "You might be right - I saw \u201che\u201d called after he was talking about Angel and thought he meant Angel but upon re-reading it looks like it might have been Luke.", "I know it's easier said than done, but I do think it's wise you make plans to distance yourself from your brother. If he's abused others, I have no reason to think he won't manipulate others against you now that he knows you're warning others. He's already started.", "NTA\n\n\"I can appreciate that you believe in family loyalty, especially if you've been misinformed, and told that what I said was untrue. I wish it were that simple. Unfortunately, all of it is true. If anyone is owed an apology, it's me, not that I will hold my breath. If you have further questions, you know where to find me.\"", "NTA losing your childhood best friend is enough for me to see that Luke IS a problem. Warning people of what he's like is not wrong. Your family are shelting him and themselves from what is he and what he's done and that's concerning.", "NTA you shpild definately give the warning, but doing more than that could really damage your relationship with both of them. Just tread lightly.", "Nta", "NTA You are protecting someone from being in an abusive relationship, that is a good thing and the right thing to do", "NTA, it was also pretty crappy of Angel to tell Luke what you said. Hopefully he just didn\u2019t think it through.", "Every domestic abuser I know has had plenty of friends and family support. It's really not that unusual.", "Wow, this sub. Where are all the \"they're two consenting adults!\" and \"mind your business!\" comments?\n\nDefinitely NTA. I hope Angel stays away!", "NTA\nYou were protecting your friend", "*all parties. Everyone is vulnerable to abuse, one way or another. People don't want to hear but everyone has the potential to become an abuse victim.", "NTA\n\nHe's right. They can date whoever they want. And to make that choice Angel deserves to have all the facts. He chose not to date your brother because of facts. Your brother is just pissed he cannot have what he wants.", "When one of my abusive exes started dating a new girl, our roommate (his best friend) warned her off. I asked him why I never got a warning and he said \"I thought you could handle him.\"\n\nLol thanks for the vote of confidence I guess.\n\nOp is NTA. Protect your friends.", "NTA.
