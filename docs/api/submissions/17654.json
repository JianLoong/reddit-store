Even though he swears up an down he's nothing like him  Luke is also an abusive pos to his boyfriend's even though my family doesnt see it. One of his first victims was my childhood bestfriend who I can't talk to anymore because he had to get distance from my brother.\n\nI' lost alot of my friends halfway through highschool because of what happened between my old bestfriend and my brother.  I've gotten pretty close to my roommate \"Angel\" (19M) and he's a really cool guy and we became fast friends.  The few times he's met my brother I could tell he has a crush on him. Luke was never around long so I just let it go though i did warn him to leave Angel alone.  He recently moved out near where I go to school and so I see him alot more and recently I've noticed Angel and Luke flirting. The other day Angel asked me if it was cool if he went on a date with my brother and I told him absolutely not and I told him how my brother treats hs partners.  He obviously listened to me because the next morning calls me like 10x while I'm in class. And when I answer he's screaming at me about how I had no right to come between him an Angel amd that they were adults and could date who ever they wanted. I just hung up and while visiting home to see family I've had some extended family asking why I'd say such \"untrue things\" about Luke and that I should apologize for what I did.
