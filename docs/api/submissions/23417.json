And husbands reaction was unacceptably nasty.\n\nBirds, even the largest of parrots, are not *nearly* as loud as dogs. Even roosters are not as loud as large dogs (it's the regularity of their noise that's the problem). Your husband is 100% out of line and a hypocrite. He's upset you didn't get the kid \"a normal pet\" and that is a major red flag.\n\nHowever, birds need very specialized and serious care, especially parrots (even smaller ones like conures). This is not an animal that should be bought on a whim (no animal should be, but especially not birds). You need to have the proper space, equipment, food, vet contacts, etc. to care properly for a bird, and most birds don't do well if kept alone (varies by species \\[sometimes breed if we're talking chickens or pigeons\\]).\n\nA conure can not survive on seeds. If the store told you that they lied. Conures can use seed as a staple but additionally require daily fruits and vegetables. Sure it will eat less than a dog, but it's diet is far more stringent and you need to take it seriously.\n\nConures also require constant social stimulation. Usually this is accomplished by having a second one, but if you have someone at home that can suffice (not recommended).\n\nA conure needs a relatively large cage, something at least 2x3x4 feet for a single bird (\\~3x3x5 for multiple), with lots of climbing surfaces and a place to hide.\n\nAlso, you can not use teflon no-stick pans. The invisible fumes from cooking with them are cancerous to humans but will kill birds near instantly! Don't use them! If you have any you need to either get rid of them or return the bird.", "ESH.

How many species of pet food are we on the hook for, how much cleaning does each require, what if the let child 1 wants doesn't get along with the let child 2 wants, etc. These conversations are YEARS overdue. I think your husband is incorrect in assuming it would be a dog or cat, it could have been a hamster or a turtle or any number of things. But even if it WAS a dog or cat, there needed to be a conversation about how this new pet would be successfully integrated into an already busy household.

I spent most of my day in the boarding area, which at the time held up to three dozen birds in two rooms (they have since moved to a much bigger facility and become more strict regarding people trying to dump unwanted birds on them). \n\nIt got so loud in there that I was experiencing symptoms of inner ear damage: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, etc. I had to start wearing those special headphones they use in gun tournaments that only cut out sounds above a certain decibel level, so I could get my work done but still hear instructions from my coworkers.\n\nKeep in mind, these animals evolved to hear each other across miles of very dense forest.\n\nI also have to ask how much research did you put into this?

Just getting a bird as a pet is usually enough for YTA.\n\nDogs and cats are relatively easy, so are plenty of other animals, because they\u2019ve been actually domesticated.

Please let me share from *my* experience. \n\nNo way. A conure is a 30 year *commitment*. Many years ago I was involved in parrot rescue. True rescue. All were originally wanted. Every. Single. Bird. (All 15-20, except one were born in captivity). My all time favorite bird was a cherry headed conure named Elvis who was goddamed rescued from an 11 year old who *had no idea*/ how neglectfully abusive they were. The family \u201ckind of felt bad\u201d that the bird was locked in a cage, or sitting alone all day every day. Thank goodness they found us. I was a nanny for a friend of the kid, and my NannyKid is the one who told me about the situation. I have far far far too many stories of the birds we saved. Birds who were so lonely or uncared for that they deplumed -pulled their feathers out- themselves. (Elvis bonded to me, then to a miniature macaw in the aviary who of course hated me because Elvis wanted us both). Some birds become very aggressive. Even properly raised parrots -including conures- can display aggressive behaviors, that a 12 year old cannot be expected to know how to curb. \n\nIt must be kept in mind that all Parrots, including conures, while not necessarily completely monogamous in the wild often mate for life and live in flocks. *They need and crave social interaction*. A single bird in captivity *can* have an awesome life, but again, adopting a conure is a COMMITMENT. A FAMILY commitment. This bird should not be sitting in a cage in the corner of a a child\u2019s room.  The kid(s) is going to be in school all day etc etc. but most concerning: \n\nThe house has at the minimum 2 other dogs and a cat, are these animals going to be cool with a bird? Is the conure going to be locked away with clipped wings  \u201cto protect it\u201d???. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nOP, Please read: \n\nHow I got into parrot rescue is largely because as a kid, I witnessed a young dog who was not being aggressive playfully \u201cmouth\u201d a bird, (like puppies do, soft \u201cbite\u201d with no teeth), and accidentally snapped its neck.  The idiots had the birds wings clipped, (so you know, they grow back like, but this practice is highly frowned upon),  it fluttered from a perch and was walking past the chilling pup\u2019s head on its way  to its cage structure, and the dog who never even got up, unwittingly killed it in half a second. The owners who were so prideful that their animals \u201call got along\u201d were shocked and devastated that their Tucum\u00e1n was dead. \n\nI am *very* concerned for the well being of this bird. \nThese people have zero idea about proper care because they have no knowledge or experience\n\n\u201cThis bird is 3 ounces\u201d\u2026..What the fuck does the weight of the bird have to do with anything? The argument for having the bird incudes the facts that the bird doesn\u2019t eat a lot or take up much space\u2026\u2026 do they even know *what* to feed or what *not* to feed the bird?? \n\nThe kid wanted a bird, so they just give a 12 year old a conure?? Absolutely not. \n\nWhat will happen when this bird is completely bonded to this kid and he leaves for college et and can\u2019t take the bird? What if the kid gets bored, or the parrot is unsafe around other pets, or if the parrot bonds to one kid and is aggressively jealous of other family members? Will OP or anyone in the house know how to handle the dynamics?? (My brain is still scared thinking about the dogs and cat in the home\u2026..) \n\nMany people who have good intentions and *want* to be good parrot guardians, simply aren\u2019t. I am coming from experience that, again, far far FAR too many families who bought a kid a parrot, end up needing to re-home the poor creature. \n\nIMO: It is unspeakably cruel to abandon a parrot who is bonded to another being. The care of parrots is not terribly complicated, but it should not be taken lightly, and it is absolutely terrifying to me that anyone should assume a kid will automatically do it well. \n\nOP: If you read this, I highly recommend the *family* do a bit of research on caring for conures. Since you are a redditor, I also am going to encourage you to visit r/parrots for advice, feedback and fellowship. It\u2019s a great community. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a dark cloud of judgmental criticism. I think that it is entirely possible that your family might have a fabulous new member who will be with you for the next 20+ years. I also believe that your child\u2019s conure *can* be well cared for and integrated, but PLEASE help your child to learn about his new friend, and don\u2019t assume that a single parrot in a cage or in a perch alone will do just fine if a just kid feeds and waters it. \n\nConures are truly awesome birds.

You say it can't be as loud as a dog (you haven't met my Loki!); a higher sound is harder to block out, and if you happened to get a sun conure as opposed to a green cheek, you're in for some noise. Also you said what's 30 years; how do you know your son will even take the bird with him when he moves out? Many places who rent don't like birds because they're noisy. Also is he aware that conures require interaction to be kept happy? Is there a place in the house where it can exercise and spend time out of it's cage away from the other animals? Because failure to do all that will result in an unhappy, bitey bird, and those little buggers can really nip. You're not the asshole for thinking outside the box, but a bigger bird requires a LOT of pre-planning and research.", "Judgement: NTA. \n\nAlso, I read that first sentence wrong and thought it said you and your husband got each OTHER pets for your 12th birthdays. I was so confused for a minute. That's what I get for scrolling Reddit at 3am.", "ESH \n\nPets are not objects, they're a responsibility. They can't be given as gifts and especially not to children.\n\nGetting a pet should be something everyone agrees with, not just one person.\n\nAlso the cat will try to hunt it which will stress it out", "NTA for that, but not only does the bird need proper care, the cat and dogs are a danger to it.", "YTA purley bc its obvious u just go to the store and pick out any backyard bred animal instead of doing proper research on care and getting it from a reputable seller.", "Info: what kind of research did you and your son do regarding the care needs of parrots? Because they are extensive. \n\nN T A just for getting the bird, but potentially TA if you and your son didn't do all the proper research to make sure he knows how to care for a parrot properly. They need a LOT of attention and enrichment and interaction and training.  They aren't low-maintenance pets. At all.", "I have a conure that's always outside of the cage through out the day. She gets breakfast  has forraging spots, and has a daily routine. We are specific about the temperature and humidity in the home too.\n\nSticking a bird is a cage is disgusting. You have other pets in the home that can kill this bird as well. You really need to think about the quality of a life and care of an animal before getting one.", "i can understand kids getting their own pets, some responsibility and a companion BUUUT its very fucking clear that ops family doesnt do shit for research for said animals care", "What if your younger son can't take his bird with him when older? What if he gets bored of it very soon? That unfortunately happens quite often. \n\nParents should only get pets they themselves are happy with to take care for until the end of the pet's life just in case the child gets bored of the pet and doesn't take care of it anymore. \n\nIn your case your husband is obviously not onboard with the bird. As both partners should agree to every pet they get, you shouldn't have gotten it in the first place.", "As a parrot owner who also lives in a country where wild parrots are super common in cities, I disagree. It\u2019s perfectly possible to create a good captive environment for pet parrots and clipping the wings doesn\u2019t really affect their lives that much if they are used to it from a young age. As long as the parrot isn\u2019t taken from the wild, having one as a pet isn\u2019t necessarily unethical.\n\nThe main issue is that in order to keep a parrot properly, with plenty of enrichment, space and attention given to them, you need to invest a LOT of work and specially research deeply into their psychological needs besides biological. Most people have no fucking idea how a dog\u2019s body language and brain work, let alone a bird\u2019s, and god parrots are so complex in those departments. It\u2019s like having a screeching toddler for 40+ years. A toddler that will become VERY destructive(both to itself and the surrounding environment) if its needs aren\u2019t met.", "Whilst I agree with you. There's a lot of people who would pass a home inspection but would just rather skip the hassle of having one and buy the pet.", "Obligatory mention for r/shittyaquariums, anyone who thinks fish keeping is \u201cchill\u201d should browse it for a depressing time.", "Pet rats are the way to go for a starter pet. Smart, affectionate, easy care, and super sturdy.", "Birds in general are considered exotic pets by default because they require specialized vet care. A standard vet will not see a bird. Hell I couldn\u2019t even have a standard vet put down a badly injured dove years ago because they had no training in bird anatomy. The same goes for rodents, fish, reptiles, etc.\n\nYou are wrong in how this terminology is used, if anything this is the first time I see someone claim another meaning for exotic pets. It has nothing to do with how \u201chard\u201d an animal is to keep, it\u2019s about whether the animal differs from the norm of cats and dogs.", "But I bet he can find birds in a bush!\n\nThe thing about purebred dogs is that they were bred for function. A spaniel is what a spaniel is. Smart and not neurotic is not part of the breed profile.", "There are still the dogs.\n\nDid OP think a conure just stays in its cage all day? That's one day to make sure the bird becomes a screeching mess.", "YTA. You bought a bird without researching it? Conures are sweetheart but they are one of the loudest things known to man (or it seems like). And yes, they commonly live WELL over 30 years. \n\nYou didn\u2019t buy your kid a pet, because responsible people don\u2019t buy pets for their kids. You bought YOU a pet. Congratulations on your 30 years commitment.", "NTA You did not force the bird on you youngest, he asked for it! Why would you give him a dog or cat when he wants a bird? Your husband is weird.... and kinda of a jerk.", "If you're going to bring a new person/animal/alien into your family, you discuss it as a family, that should go without saying. YTA", "can i ask, is having cats at all a 100% no if you want a bird? i have 2 cats and i\u2019m just curious if that means they could never be compatible", "Not necessarily, but you will have to tread very carefully. It will mainly depend on your cats and how prey driven they are (all cats have the instinct to be prey driven, but some are more predatory than others). If they are the type who would just be curious and then act like the bird didn\u2019t exist, you\u2019ll probably be fine. However if your cats see the bird only as prey and the bird isn\u2019t large enough/confident enough to put the cat in its place, you will end up with a dead bird. Biggest things to focus on would be: extremely slow introductions, don\u2019t ever let them be left alone without supervision, and make sure that the bird has their own space to get away from the cats completely (like keeping their enclosure in a separate room that the cats will not have access to). You may be able to get some idea on how the introductions will go by playing bird noises on YouTube and seeing how your cat reacts. It would be even better if you know what bird species you would likely choose so you can play specifically their sounds often enough that the cats are used to the sound before ever seeing the live bird.", "yeeahhhh I think that holds for any pet store. I did work there for a long time because I felt like I had a responsibility to the creatures that made it there. Our store cared about the animals, and they took animals to a great vet, sometimes. But the supplier was horrendous and the new ones were sick all the time. I felt stuck, like how dog rescues will sometimes pay mills for their sick puppies or out of date breeding moms....it saves that one but it contributes to this huge problem and theres no doubt you are causing more suffering than you are taking away. It really is just the worst.", "Agree - my only family pet growing up was a budgie. He'd have his own plate at dinner (only way to keep him off ours), watch TV with us, play catch and a weird attempt at finger-football, he'd cuddle on our hands and shoulders and definitely recognised us and missed us when one of us had been away. \nWe'd switch out his toys and branches regularly, so he wouldn't get bored. He was obviously free flying (except at night) and lived to 13, where he got very sick and we had to put him down.\nI like to think he had a happy, fulfilled life, but he was as much effort as a dog, except for the walks.\nAnd budgies are considered easy birds.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, I think they\u2019re saying if you\u2019re not getting something average as a pet there should be some discussion of that with your partner. Which I\u2019d agree with, especially with a bird."]}
