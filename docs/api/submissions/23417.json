And husbands reaction was unacceptably nasty.\n\nBirds, even the largest of parrots, are not *nearly* as loud as dogs. Even roosters are not as loud as large dogs (it's the regularity of their noise that's the problem). Your husband is 100% out of line and a hypocrite. He's upset you didn't get the kid \"a normal pet\" and that is a major red flag.\n\nHowever, birds need very specialized and serious care, especially parrots (even smaller ones like conures). This is not an animal that should be bought on a whim (no animal should be, but especially not birds). You need to have the proper space, equipment, food, vet contacts, etc. to care properly for a bird, and most birds don't do well if kept alone (varies by species \\[sometimes breed if we're talking chickens or pigeons\\]).\n\nA conure can not survive on seeds. If the store told you that they lied. Conures can use seed as a staple but additionally require daily fruits and vegetables. Sure it will eat less than a dog, but it's diet is far more stringent and you need to take it seriously.\n\nConures also require constant social stimulation. Usually this is accomplished by having a second one, but if you have someone at home that can suffice (not recommended).\n\nA conure needs a relatively large cage, something at least 2x3x4 feet for a single bird (\\~3x3x5 for multiple), with lots of climbing surfaces and a place to hide.\n\nAlso, you can not use teflon no-stick pans. The invisible fumes from cooking with them are cancerous to humans but will kill birds near instantly! Don't use them! If you have any you need to either get rid of them or return the bird.", "ESH.

How many species of pet food are we on the hook for, how much cleaning does each require, what if the let child 1 wants doesn't get along with the let child 2 wants, etc. These conversations are YEARS overdue. I think your husband is incorrect in assuming it would be a dog or cat, it could have been a hamster or a turtle or any number of things. But even if it WAS a dog or cat, there needed to be a conversation about how this new pet would be successfully integrated into an already busy household.

I spent most of my day in the boarding area, which at the time held up to three dozen birds in two rooms (they have since moved to a much bigger facility and become more strict regarding people trying to dump unwanted birds on them). \n\nIt got so loud in there that I was experiencing symptoms of inner ear damage: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, etc. I had to start wearing those special headphones they use in gun tournaments that only cut out sounds above a certain decibel level, so I could get my work done but still hear instructions from my coworkers.\n\nKeep in mind, these animals evolved to hear each other across miles of very dense forest.\n\nI also have to ask how much research did you put into this?

My all time favorite bird was a cherry headed conure named Elvis who was goddamed rescued from an 11 year old who *had no idea*/ how neglectfully abusive they were. The family \u201ckind of felt bad\u201d that the bird was locked in a cage, or sitting alone all day every day. Thank goodness they found us. I was a nanny for a friend of the kid, and my NannyKid is the one who told me about the situation. I have far far far too many stories of the birds we saved. Birds who were so lonely or uncared for that they deplumed -pulled their feathers out- themselves. (Elvis bonded to me, then to a miniature macaw in the aviary who of course hated me because Elvis wanted us both). Some birds become very aggressive. Even properly raised parrots -including conures- can display aggressive behaviors, that a 12 year old cannot be expected to know how to curb. \n\nIt must be kept in mind that all Parrots, including conures, while not necessarily completely monogamous in the wild often mate for life and live in flocks. *They need and crave social interaction*. A single bird in captivity *can* have an awesome life, but again, adopting a conure is a COMMITMENT. A FAMILY commitment. This bird should not be sitting in a cage in the corner of a a child\u2019s room.  The kid(s) is going to be in school all day etc etc. but most concerning: \n\nThe house has at the minimum 2 other dogs and a cat, are these animals going to be cool with a bird? Is the conure going to be locked away with clipped wings  \u201cto protect it\u201d???. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nOP, Please read: \n\nHow I got into parrot rescue is largely because as a kid, I witnessed a young dog who was not being aggressive playfully \u201cmouth\u201d a bird, (like puppies do, soft \u201cbite\u201d with no teeth), and accidentally snapped its neck.  The idiots had the birds wings clipped, (so you know, they grow back like, but this practice is highly frowned upon),  it fluttered from a perch and was walking past the chilling pup\u2019s head on its way  to its cage structure, and the dog who never even got up, unwittingly killed it in half a second. The owners who were so prideful that their animals \u201call got along\u201d were shocked and devastated that their Tucum\u00e1n was dead. \n\nI am *very* concerned for the well being of this bird. \nThese people have zero idea about proper care because they have no knowledge or experience\n\n\u201cThis bird is 3 ounces\u201d\u2026..What the fuck does the weight of the bird have to do with anything? The argument for having the bird incudes the facts that the bird doesn\u2019t eat a lot or take up much space\u2026\u2026 do they even know *what* to feed or what *not* to feed the bird?? \n\nThe kid wanted a bird, so they just give a 12 year old a conure?? Absolutely not. \n\nWhat will happen when this bird is completely bonded to this kid and he leaves for college et and can\u2019t take the bird? What if the kid gets bored, or the parrot is unsafe around other pets, or if the parrot bonds to one kid and is aggressively jealous of other family members? Will OP or anyone in the house know how to handle the dynamics?? (My brain is still scared thinking about the dogs and cat in the home\u2026..) \n\nMany people who have good intentions and *want* to be good parrot guardians, simply aren\u2019t. I am coming from experience that, again, far far FAR too many families who bought a kid a parrot, end up needing to re-home the poor creature. \n\nIMO: It is unspeakably cruel to abandon a parrot who is bonded to another being. The care of parrots is not terribly complicated, but it should not be taken lightly, and it is absolutely terrifying to me that anyone should assume a kid will automatically do it well. \n\nOP: If you read this, I highly recommend the *family* do a bit of research on caring for conures. Since you are a redditor, I also am going to encourage you to visit r/parrots for advice, feedback and fellowship. It\u2019s a great community. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a dark cloud of judgmental criticism. I think that it is entirely possible that your family might have a fabulous new member who will be with you for the next 20+ years. I also believe that your child\u2019s conure *can* be well cared for and integrated, but PLEASE help your child to learn about his new friend, and don\u2019t assume that a single parrot in a cage or in a perch alone will do just fine if a just kid feeds and waters it. \n\nConures are truly awesome birds. Please please please, do right by yours. \nGood luck\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udc9d", "In what possible way?

Like you should be going and picking out each animal together. This is just lazy lack of communication on your part", "He never laid down the terms for a new pet.  It could have been a snake or a tarantula and he should be thankful for a bird.  NTAH.", "YTA because you don't understand the pet. I mean you really don't understand the pet.\n\nJust reading your description of the bird. You might get lucky but you have no idea what you've gotten into.", "Also\u2026.. please tell me they did appropriately research birds before they got one. Some can live 80 years (macaws). They are not chill pets that all you have to do is clean their cage and feed them\u2026.", "Acquired my boa this way, we were at dinner with my father and his gf.  She asked if we knew anyone that would want a 6ft red tailed boa.\n\nI don\u2019t even know if she finished the sentence before my gf said we\u2019ll take it.", "She didn't make a major decision on her own.

Those pets did not get the care they deserved. And I got very stressed about that, to the point where I still have bad dreams where I keep discovering pets I've forgotten to feed\n\n\nDon't put that on kids. Especially birds, who need way more care then you think, are easy to forget about if tucked away into a cage, and don't need to live with a giant predator who WILL try to eat them", "My cat used to sit right next to the parakeet cage. The bird would squawk and ring his bell when it happened. He actually lived much longer than I expected.", "I mean they *can*, it's just not that common and it takes help. I say as I'm staring at the grumpy old horse I got at age 13, twenty years later.  That said, it's been a lot of work, commitment and sacrifice. I was lucky that my parents were able to keep him at their place when I went to college. In exchange I went to a close college so I could still help out and see him.  I worked and volunteered at places so that I could board him for free when I was a teenager or younger.  There was a lot of stuff I couldn't do, or weekend parties I couldn't make- Because I had to go feed or clean.  Go out to eat? Can't, I have to buy grain.  So yeah. Getting a long lived pet needs to be something everyone is fully informed about. And if you get it for your child, you need to be aware that you may end up with the animal in your care alone for several years, or possibly permanently.", "I see why the husband was surprised though, getting a kid a bird is on the same commitment level as getting a kid a horse. You don't say yeah, get him a pet, and expect them to come home with something that intense. \n\nI doubt the husband would have cared if it had been a hamster.\n\nI think OP really dropped the ball on this one. You need to do research before agreeing to a new pet, they probably know what they were getting into with the cats and dogs so they got away with it, but OP has been way too blase about this, and it's going to come back to bite them.", "Clearly, you've never had a cockatoo scream in your ear. The last time that happened, I was deaf for a half hour. I can hear my Amazons scream when I'm in my driveway. I can't hear my large dogs bark, though. Dog barks can go up to about 85 decibels, while parrots can reach as high as 150 decibels.", "They pull out their feathers and get super neurotic when they aren\u2019t getting enough attention.  I thought OP had bought a parakeet(budgie). Those are fairly easy and don\u2019t live as long. You have to be heavily involved with a conure. They also are not cheap to feed if you\u2019re actually feeding them correctly. As far as noise is concerned\u2026. I\u2019d much rather deal with a barking dog than a screeching bird.", "She doesn't think it makes sense that a conure can make as much noise as a dog. So they did not", "Depending on where you are, finding a bird to adopt can be a lot of legwork. Many shelters don't have the resources to take birds\n\n\nFinding the vet for them can be tricky as well\n\n\nEdited to change very to vet", "When the shelters want home inspections, it's easier to buy a pet.

Queue me getting a Labrador at 11, German Shepherd at 13, and goats at 14. No training and dogs lived on chains outside.\nThe Labrador killed my neighbors cat and my dad made me talk to the cops. They tried citing my dad, but he somehow argued I'm the owner and shut the door with me outside. It all sorta clicked. I got a ticket for $500 and rehomed all the animals when I turned 18. I wasn't allowed to sell them cause he bought them. \ud83e\udd74", "You shouldn't buy someone a pet if they're not expecting one.

Birds shouldn't even be sold as pets in the first place.", "If you can't pass a home inspection you don't deserve to have pets.", "In my area, shelters don't have this. Animal rescues do. Animal rescues is a hit and miss on whether they do this. The biggest hurdle for adopting in my area is that dogs available are high maintenance in some way. Often it's because they're big dogs and dogs insurance/parents consider high risk (i.e. German shepherds, pit bulls)", "To be fair they agreed \"pet\" exotic pets are pets. The dad never said standard pet", "I wish pet stores were never a thing\u2026 or at least animals being held in them. Like the earth is big enough to buy out larger lots of land and just have sanctuaries for each type of animal, and only be sold to people who will truly care for them. Pet stores should only be for selling products and food for them. So much animal abuse and neglect goes on, growing up in my home there was a lot of it. That is one of the biggest guilts I have in life, even though I was a child and couldn\u2019t really control it or have money to help them.", "When teflon gets too hot, it releases toxins into the air that don't hurt us, but will kill birds very fast because of their sensitive respiratory system. The pan would have to get very, very hot to hurt them but it's not worth the risk for most bird owners.", "Have my imaginary award, stranger. There is so much important research to be done. The vet one, especially. The college part is an excellent point too. Just waking up and asking a 12 year old what pet they want and just... running up to a pet store and getting it with little to no prep is wildly irresponsible.", "Which is definitely something I\u2019ve been questioning, but OP hasn\u2019t really answered yet.", "It's definitely possible to ethically have them as pets. But it takes time, space and a lot of learning about what they need and how to take care of them", ">Birds shouldn't even be sold as pets in the first place.\n\nSome species of birds make amazing pets. Others not so much.", "Oh wow, that's wild! \n\nTbf though, I have gerbils so I don't use anything scented anywhere near them, no spray deodorants, no candles, nothing like that. They're kept in the one room though, so I can't imagine how hard it'd be not to have anything like that near a bird, who I presume would have a good run of the house.", "I think it's better to simply impress upon people the requirements of an individual species, rather than to set brackets with terms like, beginner, intermediate, advanced, etc..\n\nSome animals require higher levels of care, or higher quality of setup. If someone is really determined to get a particular animal they are likely willing to do the work. Too many people instead just assume they'll do fine, but they don't want to set everything up ahead of time to test whether they can actually deal with maintaining the setup or the workload.\n\nChildren should not have full control of choosing a pet. It's irresponsible to put that onus on a child. A parent is the one getting a pet, they're just giving the child a say in picking it out, and parents who don't realize that are neglectful.", "Disagree. The only ethical way to keep a bird is if you are rescuing them and giving them a chance for a semblance or happiness. Birds don't belong in cages, or even inside buildings. It's fucked up and inhumane.", "It may benefit the human to have ownership of a bird, but it doesn't benefit the bird outside of a rescue situation. Birds shouldn't be bred for human amusement.", "Okay, so that seems to be a non-issue at least", "Generally the posts usually only ever discuss beginner species, which I just translate to \u2018easy\u2019 in my head.\n\nA lot of people think of pets as animated ornaments for their house, fish especially. The amount of people who get fish, put them in awful conditions and just shrug and buy more when they inevitably die is absurd.", "I assume you live somewhere rural? When I lived in a semi-rural area as a kid, it was kind of the same situation in the pet stores, even though a lot of people kept pets far stranger than you'd think. Lots of people had reptiles, especially things like ball pythons and bearded dragons, but the pet stores never even carried them and same as yours, they had the same birds for decades at a time. \n\nPeople were buying their pets outside the local area, in large part because people genuinely dedicated are usually willing to go buy from breeders or expos, but also because they just assumed the local stores didn't have variety and would drive to the city instead.", "Yeah, I live out in the countryside in Oxfordshire, but everything so close to the city anyway, it\u2019s hard to really get that far away from it!\n\nSmall reptiles aren\u2019t that uncommon as pets, turtles are definitely the most common \u2018exotic\u2019 pet I encounter though, no idea where they\u2019re getting them from though! Petshops just have rats, hamsters, rabbits and always one big parrot that hangs around and harasses anyone who comes in lol"]}
