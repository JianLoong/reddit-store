Even roosters are not as loud as large dogs (it's the regularity of their noise that's the problem). Your husband is 100% out of line and a hypocrite. He's upset you didn't get the kid \"a normal pet\" and that is a major red flag.\n\nHowever, birds need very specialized and serious care, especially parrots (even smaller ones like conures). This is not an animal that should be bought on a whim (no animal should be, but especially not birds). You need to have the proper space, equipment, food, vet contacts, etc. to care properly for a bird, and most birds don't do well if kept alone (varies by species \\[sometimes breed if we're talking chickens or pigeons\\]).\n\nA conure can not survive on seeds. If the store told you that they lied. Conures can use seed as a staple but additionally require daily fruits and vegetables. Sure it will eat less than a dog, but it's diet is far more stringent and you need to take it seriously.\n\nConures also require constant social stimulation. Usually this is accomplished by having a second one, but if you have someone at home that can suffice (not recommended).\n\nA conure needs a relatively large cage, something at least 2x3x4 feet for a single bird (\\~3x3x5 for multiple), with lots of climbing surfaces and a place to hide.\n\nAlso, you can not use teflon no-stick pans. The invisible fumes from cooking with them are cancerous to humans but will kill birds near instantly! Don't use them! If you have any you need to either get rid of them or return the bird.\n\nTo everyone saying YTA , the question isn't whether OP or the damn *bird* is the asshole, it's OP or *hubby*. And husbands reaction was unacceptably nasty.", "ESH. Why are you all just buying animals without talking to each other first? Honestly never understood how people think it\u2019s ok to make major family decisions with zero communication.", "YTA, because owning a bird (unless you are literally a licensed rescuer) is cruel. I will never understand the appeal of keeping a wild animal that is meant to fly as a pet in a cage.\n\nThe bird smuggling and breeding industry is incredibly exploitative.", "Nta however this sounds like a communication break down. Here\u2019s the thing. My kids love to whistle. BUT they don\u2019t get to whistle in the home bc it hurts my ears. Dogs barking are different pitches. The bird also requires different care which you guys will have to do a lot of research and learn about. And mixing animals that don\u2019t typically get along\u2026how will that work? Maybe your husband expects the animals to stay in your house forever. Who will take care of these animals if your kiddos go off to college and live in the dorms?", "YTA that\u2019s a significant decision to spring on your spouse after the fact. Also this bird is your responsibility for 30 years, a 12 year old can\u2019t make that kind of commitment.", "ESH \n\nA new pet should have been a discussion between you and your husband, with plenty of research on what pet is a good fit for your family. \n\nHe shouldn't have assumed you would get a dog or cat, and you shouldn't have chosen a bird without that conversation.", "YTA \nYou need to have a conversation with your partner before bringing home another actually living, breathing being. All pets require commitment and add responsibility to the household. It\u2019s just not a decision you go ahead and make unilaterally.", "YTA. \n\nAs someone who likes uncommon pets, I gotta say that birds require a very special kind of person to take care of them. Most pet birds are highly social animals that require constant attention, and if they don't they suffer from all kinds of mental illnesses. I plan to keep monitor lizards later in life, and I'd much rather deal with a 6' long lizard than I would a bird. Just so much more involved care is required. People who own birds, that's their life, their personality, and all of their free time.", "YTA, an exotic animal should have been a discussion at minimum. Also, arent conures really expensive? I really hope you did some research on taking care of a bird. They are more work than a dog or cat", "YTA - as someone who works with birds literally every day, I have seen countless birds come in sick or already dead because of uneducated owners. Birds are not a \u201coh let\u2019s just go pick one out\u201d type purchase. They are so unbelievably smart and will not tolerate being ignored when a 12 year old CHILD gets bored of it. They require immense (and quite specific) care. Not to mention birds can become stressed to the point of having heart attacks (which I\u2019m sure loud dogs and a cat in the home will make this a very likely scenario). The only saving grace is that you got a conure instead of a species large enough to take fingers off. A conure can still definitely break skin when they bite though. People like you are why the exotic pet industry should not exist.", "YTA- I feel like you should have spoken to your husband about it first and had a calm and civilized discussion, you both share the house and any pet being brought in should be a family discussion. You're acting like a child trying to rationalize it.", "YTA, why wouldn\u2019t you have talked about the specific pet choice first? Your husband shouldn\u2019t have had to outline exactly what you should and shouldn\u2019t consider, assuming you\u2019d get a dog or cat makes TOTAL sense considering you already have 3. \n\nYou\u2019re also TA for getting a bird without knowing anything about them like lifespan or the fact that conures can be very vocal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think the tradition that each child chooses a pet at 12 is cute, and if anybody can give a pet as a gift it's the damn parents. However. You and your husband need to be having actual conversations about all of this - what four pets means in a household (and I have 4 indoor pets and numerous outdoor animals so I'm not anti-pet here). How many species of let food are we on the hook for, how much cleaning does each require, what if the let child 1 wants doesn't get along with the let child 2 wants, etc. These conversations are YEARS overdue. I think your husband is incorrect in assuming it would be a dog or cat, it could have been a hamster or a turtle or any number of things. But even if it WAS a dog or cat, there needed to be a conversation about how this new pet would be successfully integrated into an already busy household. You have two large dogs, what if child 4 wanted a Chihuahua? You're doing your children a disservice in the way you just...don't plan or discuss, and I'm guessing let's aren't the only topic in that category.\n\nAnd I've pet-sat conures, they are loud as FUCK.", "YTA never buy any pet without discussing it with your spouse first", "YTA. A pet, any pet, is not something you buy on impulse to please a CHILD. It\u2019s a living being that deserves care and the decisions needs to be though through.", "ESH\u2026", "The bird won't live very long if the cat stresses it into an early grave trying to eat it. You have to make sure new pets are compatible with existing pets.\n\nAnd I can't believe I need to tell an adult this but PETS. ARE. NOT. PRESENTS. FOR. KIDS.\n\nAt 12 they cannot even be legally responsible for them so any issues are up to you to to resolve. The cat gets the bird the kids in tears what you gonna do? One of you loses a job and can't afford four animals, so the kids lose them because it's really your animals, what then? YTA, having a family pet is on thing but I don't think this is very responsible at all.", "sooo I have issues understanding your family, you have at least 4 kids and decided it was a good idea this pet-at-twelve rule for all of them? WHo is responsible for said pets? you and your husband till your kids are adults, that's who. As such I simply cannot understand there is not decision process nor communication BEFORE getting said pets? WTF ? \n\nAlso it is kind of irresponsible to keep adding new animals like that, where's your guarantee the existing one's will take it well ?\n\nAnd lastly if your kid decided on poisonous spiders or a baby tiger would there also be literally no discussion around it in the family at all? That's just so weird to me tbh.\n\nAnyways ESH , since you and your SO seem to have serious communication gaps as parents", "YTA - You've now got a bird living in a cage with a cat and two dogs. The bird can never safely leave the cage which means it'll be imprisoned for life. Even if you did let it out in the house you're risking it's life. \nI'll never understand how people can think owning caged birds is remotely acceptable.", "YTA. Animals are lifetime commitments and birds don't belong in cages.", "Eh...ESH. Your family has communication issues. I hope your son is prepared and educated to care for a bird.", "YTA.  Bird ownership = asshole like 95% of the time.  Do a little research on the ethics of bird ownership.", "YTA. You gave your 12 year-old-son old a pet that requires non-typical care and, assuming that your 12 year old is able to provide it, could live until your 12-year-old-son is **42.** That bird has a nonzero chance of outliving *you*. \n\nYou're an idiot for not looking into this more, an asshole for not involving your spouse in this decision, and a dumbass for just doing what your 12-year-old wants.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think this bird could ever be as loud as the dogs.\u201d\n\n[laughs]\n\nINFO: Did he make you aware of what they were getting for the other kid\u2019s birthdays beforehand, or was it a surprise to you like the bird was to him?", "If you haven\u2019t even discussed it with your husband, then you probably didn\u2019t do any research into bird care.

On both counts.", "Hard disagree. Some birds are more work, not all. I've worked with some absolutely lovely birds and some spoiled rotten little dogs. Some conure species are fairly common in captivity, a few hundred dollars, expensive yes, but similar or less than a cat or dog.\n\n\"Exotic\", nah, just some people get elitist over things being \"normal\" or not. Conures are bred in captivity, not exotic pet trade.", "While conures are generally vocal, OP kind of lucked out and the noises they make are not particularly loud. Dogs are in fact far louder.", "The cat isn't here. Our oldest son took it with him when he moved out.", "Two of our kids are adults, actually. The 21 year old still lives here, but she's planning to move out when she graduates.", "Also, it just occurred to me, is it possible your husband is maybe afraid of birds on some level? That is more common than it would seem, and his chaotic argumentation would suggest there might be a completely different reason he is not happy about this pet in particular. He maybe doesn't want to admit he has some personal problem with it. ...that is just my personal theory tho, completely subjective , but decided to share just in case...", "He told me to get them a pet, so I got them what they wanted. Oldest wanted a cat, so we went to the shelter and filled out an application for a black and white kitten. I took him to get all the supplies, and then when we were approved, we picked him up and brought him home. Daughter wanted a dog, so I took her to the pit bull rescue our friend runs, and we got her one. Next kid also wanted a dog, but he wanted a bigger dog, so I took him to the shelter and got him some sort of Great Dane mix.", "Exotic usually applies to animals that require a higher level of supply and attention to adequately take care of. Additionally exotic often applies when you look at vet care since many vets will not accept exotic pets.", "will she bring the cat with her? \n\nAlso even with the age difference the pets still share a home for a significant amount of time, and you had to know it, so this is not quite a valid point here I think.", "Fair enough, though that's not often how it's used. From the general public it's more often used either in an exoticizing or disparaging way.\n\nNot all birds truly warrant the term by that usage either, as many are far easier to care for than a dog.", "The cat is our son's.
