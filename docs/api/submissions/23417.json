And husbands reaction was unacceptably nasty.\n\nBirds, even the largest of parrots, are not *nearly* as loud as dogs. Even roosters are not as loud as large dogs (it's the regularity of their noise that's the problem). Your husband is 100% out of line and a hypocrite. He's upset you didn't get the kid \"a normal pet\" and that is a major red flag.\n\nHowever, birds need very specialized and serious care, especially parrots (even smaller ones like conures). This is not an animal that should be bought on a whim (no animal should be, but especially not birds). You need to have the proper space, equipment, food, vet contacts, etc. to care properly for a bird, and most birds don't do well if kept alone (varies by species \\[sometimes breed if we're talking chickens or pigeons\\]).\n\nA conure can not survive on seeds. If the store told you that they lied. Conures can use seed as a staple but additionally require daily fruits and vegetables. Sure it will eat less than a dog, but it's diet is far more stringent and you need to take it seriously.\n\nConures also require constant social stimulation. Usually this is accomplished by having a second one, but if you have someone at home that can suffice (not recommended).\n\nA conure needs a relatively large cage, something at least 2x3x4 feet for a single bird (\\~3x3x5 for multiple), with lots of climbing surfaces and a place to hide.\n\nAlso, you can not use teflon no-stick pans. The invisible fumes from cooking with them are cancerous to humans but will kill birds near instantly! Don't use them! If you have any you need to either get rid of them or return the bird.", "ESH.

How many species of pet food are we on the hook for, how much cleaning does each require, what if the let child 1 wants doesn't get along with the let child 2 wants, etc. These conversations are YEARS overdue. I think your husband is incorrect in assuming it would be a dog or cat, it could have been a hamster or a turtle or any number of things. But even if it WAS a dog or cat, there needed to be a conversation about how this new pet would be successfully integrated into an already busy household.

I spent most of my day in the boarding area, which at the time held up to three dozen birds in two rooms (they have since moved to a much bigger facility and become more strict regarding people trying to dump unwanted birds on them). \n\nIt got so loud in there that I was experiencing symptoms of inner ear damage: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, etc. I had to start wearing those special headphones they use in gun tournaments that only cut out sounds above a certain decibel level, so I could get my work done but still hear instructions from my coworkers.\n\nKeep in mind, these animals evolved to hear each other across miles of very dense forest.\n\nI also have to ask how much research did you put into this?

My all time favorite bird was a cherry headed conure named Elvis who was goddamed rescued from an 11 year old who *had no idea*/ how neglectfully abusive they were. The family \u201ckind of felt bad\u201d that the bird was locked in a cage, or sitting alone all day every day. Thank goodness they found us. I was a nanny for a friend of the kid, and my NannyKid is the one who told me about the situation. I have far far far too many stories of the birds we saved. Birds who were so lonely or uncared for that they deplumed -pulled their feathers out- themselves. (Elvis bonded to me, then to a miniature macaw in the aviary who of course hated me because Elvis wanted us both). Some birds become very aggressive. Even properly raised parrots -including conures- can display aggressive behaviors, that a 12 year old cannot be expected to know how to curb. \n\nIt must be kept in mind that all Parrots, including conures, while not necessarily completely monogamous in the wild often mate for life and live in flocks. *They need and crave social interaction*. A single bird in captivity *can* have an awesome life, but again, adopting a conure is a COMMITMENT. A FAMILY commitment. This bird should not be sitting in a cage in the corner of a a child\u2019s room.  The kid(s) is going to be in school all day etc etc. but most concerning: \n\nThe house has at the minimum 2 other dogs and a cat, are these animals going to be cool with a bird? Is the conure going to be locked away with clipped wings  \u201cto protect it\u201d???. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nOP, Please read: \n\nHow I got into parrot rescue is largely because as a kid, I witnessed a young dog who was not being aggressive playfully \u201cmouth\u201d a bird, (like puppies do, soft \u201cbite\u201d with no teeth), and accidentally snapped its neck.  The idiots had the birds wings clipped, (so you know, they grow back like, but this practice is highly frowned upon),  it fluttered from a perch and was walking past the chilling pup\u2019s head on its way  to its cage structure, and the dog who never even got up, unwittingly killed it in half a second. The owners who were so prideful that their animals \u201call got along\u201d were shocked and devastated that their Tucum\u00e1n was dead. \n\nI am *very* concerned for the well being of this bird. \nThese people have zero idea about proper care because they have no knowledge or experience\n\n\u201cThis bird is 3 ounces\u201d\u2026..What the fuck does the weight of the bird have to do with anything? The argument for having the bird incudes the facts that the bird doesn\u2019t eat a lot or take up much space\u2026\u2026 do they even know *what* to feed or what *not* to feed the bird?? \n\nThe kid wanted a bird, so they just give a 12 year old a conure?? Absolutely not. \n\nWhat will happen when this bird is completely bonded to this kid and he leaves for college et and can\u2019t take the bird? What if the kid gets bored, or the parrot is unsafe around other pets, or if the parrot bonds to one kid and is aggressively jealous of other family members? Will OP or anyone in the house know how to handle the dynamics?? (My brain is still scared thinking about the dogs and cat in the home\u2026..) \n\nMany people who have good intentions and *want* to be good parrot guardians, simply aren\u2019t. I am coming from experience that, again, far far FAR too many families who bought a kid a parrot, end up needing to re-home the poor creature. \n\nIMO: It is unspeakably cruel to abandon a parrot who is bonded to another being. The care of parrots is not terribly complicated, but it should not be taken lightly, and it is absolutely terrifying to me that anyone should assume a kid will automatically do it well. \n\nOP: If you read this, I highly recommend the *family* do a bit of research on caring for conures. Since you are a redditor, I also am going to encourage you to visit r/parrots for advice, feedback and fellowship. It\u2019s a great community. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a dark cloud of judgmental criticism. I think that it is entirely possible that your family might have a fabulous new member who will be with you for the next 20+ years. I also believe that your child\u2019s conure *can* be well cared for and integrated, but PLEASE help your child to learn about his new friend, and don\u2019t assume that a single parrot in a cage or in a perch alone will do just fine if a just kid feeds and waters it. \n\nConures are truly awesome birds. Please please please, do right by yours. \nGood luck\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udc9d", "In what possible way? He repeatedly left this decision up to her, and when she gets something \"abnormal\" he freaks out. Yes she should have communicated, but he left the previous pets entirely as her responsibility too, reasonable to assume that her responsibility means her input.", "He's been leaving OP in charge of it for all the other pets. Yes OP made a bad choice, but his reaction was not acceptable and for completely wrong reasons.\n\nBirds are plenty normal pets, even if a parrot specifically was a bad choice.", "People often fail to do the required research for fish too. Every sort of exotic animal has specific care and habitat needs that a lot of new pet owners just never bother to learn.", "No you didn't. You asked if he told me what kind of pets the other kids were getting. I'm the one that got those pets, not him. You said \"did he make you aware of what they were getting for the other kid's birthdays beforehand?\" No, he didn't. He didn't know. I did that part.", "I said some ***birds***, not some ***parrots***. Parrots are a ridiculous commitment. Taking in a parrot is like taking in a spiteful, hormonal, neuro-divergent toddler that can fly, eat furniture, and will never age (mentally).\n\nI covered most of that in my other replies, and OP said cat is already out of the house. OP is still a fool (just not the asshole, as the question was whether OP or husband was the asshole in their exchange).", "He had had fish before and took really good care of them he just got a bigger tank.", "\nAnd your post reads that both of you got your kids pets for their birthday. But that\u2019s not true. You\u2019re the one that did. \n\nThe root core of my question is did he know what was being gotten beforehand.", "I'm the one that did the physical act of going and getting them, but we both decided to get a pet, and he paid for it, so it's a joint effort. And what you are saying you asked contradicts the text of your original comment. But no, he did not know what we were getting. He told me to take care of it, and I took care of it.", "So all the other times it was never discussed beforehand what pet it was going to be? He just told you to get the pet they wanted, paid for it and told you to handle it?", "Yes", "Updating my verdict to NTA then.\n\nEdit: Actually ESH\n\nBecause it\u2019s a bird, and that\u2019s not a conventional or expected pet. This should have been discussed. \n\nParrot-types are far more likely to be nosier and messier than a cat or dog.", "Messier 200%! Parrots can chew up wooden furniture too.\n\nNoise is subjective. Large dogs are just about the loudest animal when they want to be. But unless you have hyperactive dogs they likely aren't making noise at full blast all that often. For dogs sound is typically a reaction, especially barking. It's generally either an aggression or play response. Most of a dogs general communication comes from body language and even smell.\n\nLarge parrots can get nearly as loud but almost all birds will make noise far more often, if not borderline continuously, as noise is just how they communicate."]}
