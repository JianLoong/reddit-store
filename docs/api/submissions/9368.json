She used to work as a teacher but she's on a medical leave since September last year. My husband (57) works full time in a company and I work full time in the education system as well. \n\nMy daughter does nothing around the house, she only ever sleeps and occasionally walks the dog we own. She's most of her time sitting in her desk playing games or watching some show on Netflix. Still she insists on showering three times a day (morning, afternoon and night). This has become an issue for my husband and I. \n\nWe have three more kids besides her but all of them are grown up and live alone, she used to live alone too before some stuff happened which made her have to move in with us. When all of our children had moved away my husband and I sold our oldest house which was big to buy a smaller one as we didn't need that many rooms. This house only has two bedrooms and one bathroom. \n\nMy husband and I both wake up at 7:00 AM everyday to go to work. He has to be there by 8:30 so he showers first, I shower after him because I have to be at my work place at 9:00AM. That was our routine but now our daughter wakes up around half an hour after us and she takes the bathroom to get a shower. That means that one of us will miss their opportunity to have a shower before work. We have talked before and told her that she should have breakfast with us and have a shower after we leave as she's not in a rush. She said she needed to get a shower as soon as she wake up for whatever reason. I told her to wake up later, she told me she can't sleep any further because we make noise and wake her up. \n\nThen in the nights it's the same. We're tired and just want to have a shower, eat some dinner and go to bed after work. But we have to wait until she gets her shower first. \n\nSo we approached her again and this time we told her that from now on she'll have to shower just once a day, in the afternoon, so we get to shower before/after work. \n\nShe took it very badly and accused us of being assholes and using the shower as a excuse to tell her we think she does nothing all day. \n\nOur kids are on our side but the way she spoke to us made me feel very bad, it makes me think that maybe I'm an jerk. I understand that she might still be used to our oldest house which had more than one bathroom and this didn't happened but also I think she needs to understand us too.", "created_utc": 1675780459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3b9u/aita_for_limiting_my_daughter_to_just_one_shower/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Baby wipes are designed not to overdry skin even when used consistently, so it might address any cleanliness compulsions without harm.\n\nEither way I'd suggest consulting with a dermatologist in conjunction with the therapist (telehealth if daughter isn't comfy being in an office with a doctor) just to make sure she isn't causing damage with her routine.", "NTA.

Have your husband shower right away, then jump in yourself before she can. It sounds like you suggested she wait and then the second she said no you backed off, which led to you getting frustrated. You said she's in therapy twice a week. It takes time to make progress, and hopefully she's doing better soon. I highly recommend EMDR if she isn't doing it yet.

I'm not sure what illness your daughter has but while she is in your house and not working, she can wait on a shower till you leave for the day.

I have OCD and shower twice a day as well as wash my hands up to 200 times a day (as well as other rituals). I definitely do not interfere with my parents' bathroom time, though. The way I see it, they have priority over me. If your daughter is in a similar situation, maybe the additional support of a psychiatrist could help? Breaking a ritual is incredibly difficult, even with a therapist, and sometimes medication can help ease them. I feel like a compromise can be made here. Can she wake up earlier to shower? If she's waking up earlier, then she could go to bed earlier and have her nightly shower before you two go to bed.\n\nI'm saying NAH unless there's information that was missed.", "Definitely NTA.  Your daughter is a guest in your house and either she follows the rules of the house or out she goes.  She sounds incredibly entitled and you should not be enabling such behavior.

Pick a time, maybe at night. You do not need two showers a day and it is terrible for your skin and hair. Really you should not even shower every day. Anyway, set the time for you and your husband at night. Work it around her schedule, I am guessing she showers right before bed. I am also guessing she was raped and super depressed. For her mental health she needs those showers until she feels she doesn't. Try to have some empathy here.

Probably an unpopular opinion, but you can't tell someone how many times they should shower, even if they live in your house, as everyone will have different needs? However, 3 showers is a lot, so if she's showering that much, maybe there's a different issue all together that needs to be addressed?\nIn my opinion you should work together to figure out what the reason for it is, and sort that out first. \nAlso, she's TA too, because although she feels the need to shower, she's not being cooperative and understanding of your and your husband's schedules.", "NTA. If she wants that type of schedule, she should move out. \n\nShe\u2019s a guest. She should be considerate of the working people who support her.", "She does nothing all day!  She sounds like she needs mental help/therapy-3 showers a day is not normal behavior.  It is your house, if she wants to shower more-she can move out. NTA", "NTA. You say she\u2019s in therapy. Clearly she had some kind of medical trauma you\u2019ve mentioned and you won\u2019t ask her to move out. \n\nThen she needs to see a psychiatrist and get on different medication for depression if she isn\u2019t already. If she is, clearly she needs to up the dose or try a different medication. \n\nThis routine is NOT sustainable. Is this what you want your life to look like in a year? Two? Five? What\u2019s the long term plan here? She continues therapy, gets better and moves out and starts her career again? Or exactly like it is now. She is in a massive depressive state, unable to enjoy life and participate in the world around her and make positive contributions to the household. Except fast forward and now she\u2019s 40.

Rather than enforcing your own shower ban, tell her your concerns and ask her to bring it up with her therapist.\n\nYou might also benefit from a couple of sessions with a counselor of your own.
