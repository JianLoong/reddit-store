I just assumed that he was the one that was going to drive the way back as well, so I decided to have some fun drinks that they had in there. We split up and I went with one of my friends to try the drinks and my other friend, Anny and the boyfriend stayed in another area of the bar. I wasn't super drunk but I was in no way capable of driving, so when we met up again I was surprised to see that the boyfriend was drinking as well.\n\nI asked them who was going to drive us back and everyone said that it would be me as always, but I explained that I wouldn't be able to. Anny got surprisingly angry and said that I should have told them that I was planning on drinking as well. I said that it didn't make sense to want me to drive everyone back when the car was his, and if they expected me to just drive everyone then ask a Uber to take me home. She just told me to fuck off and left with her boyfriend.\n\nMy other two friends are on my side on this but Anny is still angry at me and sent me a text accusing me of embarrassing her boyfriend im front of everyone.

You should not be *expected* to be the designated driver just because you usually/always are.  Their invite; they should have gotten all this straightened out beforehand.

If someone else drives there, the default assumption is not that someone else will drive their car back; the default assumption is that the person who drove there will be driving back.\n\nNo one discussed alternative plans with you so you had no indication they assumed you'd drive someone else's car back. Anny and her BF embarrassed themselves - not your fault, nor your problem.\n\nThere was no communication failure on your part; they were in the driver's seat, the onus is on them to clarify plans.

Know who's the DD before you leave.", "I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say NAH. You're right, you didn't have to say anything and they could've taken an Uber home. But as well, when you put yourself in a position constantly, everyone is going to assume you're going to do what you've always done. In this case being a designated driver. It sucks and its weird, but I would've said something before had just to not cause any confusion. You did good, just don't put yourself in a constant thing as to not allow people to assume and generally walk all over you, cuz people will do that if you let them. I hope this helps or at least makes sense.", "ESH. It's completely irresponsible to not have this stuff sorted out prior to going out and at 25 years old you all should know better. You're not new to drinking.", "ESH\n\nThat is not something you assume, you make it clear before the party", "ESH this should have been openly discussed before everyone started drinking.  Not everyone making silent assumptions to themselves.", "ESH. There is a severe lack of communication here and everyone is at fault.", "ESH.  You both should have discussed the DD before going to a party.", "ESH. I'm of the belief that you should always have a plan when drinking and discuss the plan ahead of time. You al failed to plan but Anny has no right to be upset with you in particular.", "ESH. You all need to have explicit, agreed-upon plans. Every. Single. Outing. I would\u2019ve been inclined to say NTA, but you acknowledged that the group said they thought you\u2019d drive everyone home \u201cas usual,\u201d which makes it sound like that\u2019s the default situation. In that case, I can understand how they may expect you to drive if that\u2019s been the ongoing practice. Knowing this is the expectation, it would\u2019ve been helpful for you to share at the outset that you are drinking and can\u2019t drive. But, again, ultimately it\u2019s on everyone in the group to be responsible.", "NTA. Why would you even think you'd drive his car without being told in advance?", "Yikes. I\u2019m sorry dude. Nta but rethink your friend. She seems to be using you. Unless this is a one off or it was a special occasion for her but even then who doesn\u2019t ask???", "NTA. You confirm the designated driver, you never assume and you 100% don't assume if someone else drives you there. Expecting you to come, not drink, drive everyone home then need to pay to get yourself home from their place is absolutely insane.\n\nEven if you drove, they have to know specifically you're the DD. I know loads of people that will drive friends into town to party but leave the car there. Then they'll go into town shopping or something and drive the car home.  If you didn't ask someone to be your DD, you don't have one.", "ESH\n\nYou all should have made plans for safe return home. Including you, where you would have been fully justified in claiming driving karma based on previous drives.\n\nNot planning is how drunk driving happens", "NTA. Ask her if she had any intention of paying for your Uber home. We all know the answer, but make her say it out loud.", "NTA. Anny's an entitled brat. She and her boyfriend embarrassed themselves. You didn't drive there; if no one said anything, wtf would you assume you'd be driving back?", "NTA if your friend wanted you to drive she should have asked instead of assuming. You are right if they wanted you to drive they should have asked especially when he came around to pick everyone up. When I would drive for friends I always preferred driving my vehicle unless someone had a bigger car in which case we would set up bf going out.", "It sounds like Anny uses OP for a sober ride honestly.", "You shouldn't expected someone to drive home when they didn't drive", "NTA -  but Anny sure is. Unwritten rule - whoever drives IS the designated driver. She had no right to expect you would drive her boyfriend\u2019s car or accuse you of embarrassing her boyfriend? That\u2019s on him.", "Girl freak her and her boyfriend NTA", "INFO: When you are normally DD, do you normally discuss it first? Or is it always assumed you are DD?", "NTA \n\nAnny can fuck off. If her boyfriend planned to drink they should\u2019ve said that in advance. Why would you assume you were going to drive someone else\u2019s car home???", "NTA. You're not even on the insurance for his car so why would they expect you to drive it?", "NTA you don't decide on who will be driver before I don't see why you can't drink. But next time should plan on the one who will drive before.", "NTA, if they offered to drive you there, the assumption is they would drive you home. Beyond that, they were required to ask permission.", "NTA", "NTA and Anny owes you one heck of an apology", "NTA.  Anny might be since she assumed", "Nta Annie sucks", "Nta. Your right why would you have driven his car back when he drove there?  And maybe you just need to stop being the designated driver and just meet people places or start taking turns with them.", "You're NTA. IMO, there was no AH at first (until Annie  started acting like one). Here was the problem:  Since you've always been the DD, everyone has come to take it for granted & assume you'll never drink & be their DD every night out. Where as you thought that since someone else had a car this time they took the responsibility for the night & you could finally let loose . Next time you go out with friends , discuss it beforehand each & every time & this situation won't be a problem again. Annie owes you an apology by the way.", "I wouldn't want to drive someone else's car and no one should assume you would. Only way I would drive a strangers car is if someone was bleeding out and I had to get them to the emergency room.  You should always make sure the DD knows they are the DD.", "This! Just because OP is usually the DD does not mean anyone should assume they will always be the DD. That's without taking into account someone else drove everyone to the party. And that someone was a new boyfriend which sounds like OP had never met before. Why would Anny or the new boyfriend think it was acceptable for OP to drive new boyfriend's car??? I'm wondering if boyfriend was told by Anny that OP had agreed to be DD and that is why Anny is embarrassed?"]}
