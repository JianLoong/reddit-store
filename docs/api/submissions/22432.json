But as well, when you put yourself in a position constantly, everyone is going to assume you're going to do what you've always done. In this case being a designated driver. It sucks and its weird, but I would've said something before had just to not cause any confusion. You did good, just don't put yourself in a constant thing as to not allow people to assume and generally walk all over you, cuz people will do that if you let them. I hope this helps or at least makes sense.", "ESH. It's completely irresponsible to not have this stuff sorted out prior to going out and at 25 years old you all should know better. You're not new to drinking.", "ESH\n\nThat is not something you assume, you make it clear before the party", "ESH this should have been openly discussed before everyone started drinking.  Not everyone making silent assumptions to themselves.", "ESH. There is a severe lack of communication here and everyone is at fault.", "ESH.  You both should have discussed the DD before going to a party.", "ESH. I'm of the belief that you should always have a plan when drinking and discuss the plan ahead of time. You al failed to plan but Anny has no right to be upset with you in particular.", "ESH. You all need to have explicit, agreed-upon plans. Every. Single. Outing. I would\u2019ve been inclined to say NTA, but you acknowledged that the group said they thought you\u2019d drive everyone home \u201cas usual,\u201d which makes it sound like that\u2019s the default situation. In that case, I can understand how they may expect you to drive if that\u2019s been the ongoing practice. Knowing this is the expectation, it would\u2019ve been helpful for you to share at the outset that you are drinking and can\u2019t drive. But, again, ultimately it\u2019s on everyone in the group to be responsible.", "NTA. Why would you even think you'd drive his car without being told in advance?", "Yikes. I\u2019m sorry dude.

You confirm the designated driver, you never assume and you 100% don't assume if someone else drives you there. Expecting you to come, not drink, drive everyone home then need to pay to get yourself home from their place is absolutely insane.\n\nEven if you drove, they have to know specifically you're the DD. I know loads of people that will drive friends into town to party but leave the car there. Then they'll go into town shopping or something and drive the car home.  If you didn't ask someone to be your DD, you don't have one.", "ESH\n\nYou all should have made plans for safe return home. Including you, where you would have been fully justified in claiming driving karma based on previous drives.\n\nNot planning is how drunk driving happens", "NTA. Ask her if she had any intention of paying for your Uber home. We all know the answer, but make her say it out loud.", "NTA. Anny's an entitled brat. She and her boyfriend embarrassed themselves. You didn't drive there; if no one said anything, wtf would you assume you'd be driving back?", "NTA if your friend wanted you to drive she should have asked instead of assuming. You are right if they wanted you to drive they should have asked especially when he came around to pick everyone up.

IMO, there was no AH at first (until Annie  started acting like one). Here was the problem:  Since you've always been the DD, everyone has come to take it for granted & assume you'll never drink & be their DD every night out. Where as you thought that since someone else had a car this time they took the responsibility for the night & you could finally let loose . Next time you go out with friends , discuss it beforehand each & every time & this situation won't be a problem again. Annie owes you an apology by the way.", "I wouldn't want to drive someone else's car and no one should assume you would. Only way I would drive a strangers car is if someone was bleeding out and I had to get them to the emergency room.  You should always make sure the DD knows they are the DD.", "This! Just because OP is usually the DD does not mean anyone should assume they will always be the DD. That's without taking into account someone else drove everyone to the party. And that someone was a new boyfriend which sounds like OP had never met before. Why would Anny or the new boyfriend think it was acceptable for OP to drive new boyfriend's car??? I'm wondering if boyfriend was told by Anny that OP had agreed to be DD and that is why Anny is embarrassed?", "NTA at all. It's generally accepted that whoever does the driving to a venue is the person who will be driving home.", "At 25 your friend should be starting to get past stupid nonsense like this. \n\nHe drove there, of course the assumption is he'll drive home. If theres any doubt about that, or if he doesn't want to, then they should use their words. \n\nNew boyfriend yeah? I'm guessing she told him you'd drive, but never asked you. Now she's embarrased because she knows she messed up but is trying to make it seem like you did so she doesn't look silly in front of the new BF.\n\nIf he's embarrased, thats on her, not on you. Expect (demand) an apology before you drive her home ever again.", "It worries me that your friend's boyfriend, who is clearly in the wrong, is pitting her against you.  Red flag. \"Your friends suck/they humiliated me/take my side and call them out\" is how the isolation begins.", "It really depends.\n\n\nNTA.\n\nBut if there is a clear precedent that you always drive (eg: if you always offer - say last 5 or more times\u2026 and it would be the exception to the rule) - it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to speak up earlier. Still NTA then, but still good to speak up.", "NTA. I can't imagine handing my car keys to someone else at the end of an event and expecting them to play chauffeur. \n\nIt's not unusual to assume the person that drove you to the venue would be the same person that drives you home.", "Nta, but this is something that needs to be talked about before you all drink. What if NOONE has money or Uber or whatever and then you are all drunk and stranded. You assumed he would drive his own car, as any sane person should, but they assumed you would drive them back \u201clike you always do\u201d.
