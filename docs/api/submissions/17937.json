They found a new one and move in about a week or so. \n\nSince they have been staying here, my sons fianc\u00e9 NEVER offers to help with anything. She will if she is asked to, but does not offer. She does keep to herself and stays home with their dogs so my son can go golf and stuff. And she does all of her and my sons laundry. She also cooks for herself and does her own dishes if she uses them. Over the weekend my wife and I were cutting trees down in our yard and my son came out to help and I asked where his fianc\u00e9 was and he said that she didn\u2019t feel good so she wasn\u2019t going to help. Apparently she got her period and her period pains are \u201cdebilitating\u201d. My wife let it go and said it was fine but it bothered me a lot that she didn\u2019t even offer to help. \n\nLater that night, after dinner she was sitting at the table on her phone while my wife did the dishes and I just snapped. I told her that if she wants to continue to stay here in my house then she needs to start doing stuff around the house. She ignored me and I went outside to complain to my son, but she must\u2019ve texted him because he told me to stop talking to her for the rest of the time they are staying there and is currently mad at me as well. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she can just not offer to help. So AITA for expecting her to pull her share around the house?\n\nEDIT: It appears my sons fianc\u00e9 has found the post and confronted me about it. My son has packed all their belongings and they have left to stay with a friend in a town an hour away. I accept that I am TA, and I tried to apologize, but she refused to accept it and my wife told me my son said that I have been disinvited from their wedding for the unforeseeable future.", "created_utc": 1684784162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13p0s4q/aita_for_expecting_daughter_in_law_to_help_around/", "score": 1896, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She cooks and cleans up after herself completely. \n2. You doubt her period pains?? Why??\n3. You make no mention of what your son does around the house, except golf. What does he contribute?\n4. You never mentioned this before\n5. You blew up at her out of nowhere\n\nSo I don't see any way in which you aren't the asshole in this circumstance. Maybe grow up and learn to communicate like an adult?", "YTA for:\n\n1. Expecting temporary visitors to your home to do hard manual labor like cutting down freaking trees. This is wild.\n2. Not having a conversation about expectations prior to allowing them to move in.\n3. Expecting her to read your mind.\n4. Feeling some kind of way about her health. Not even going to go there.\n5. Jumping on her out of the blue. What gives you the right snap at her? \n\nThey are staying there a short time and the DIL keeps to herself, takes care of her dogs appropriately, does their laundry, prepares food for them and cleans up behind herself. And doesn't get ruffled when a grown man jumps on her out of the blue. She sounds pretty amazing. You sir, sound like YTA.", "Info: your question says you want \"her to pull her share around the house,\" but you've also stated that she does her own laundry and your sons. That she does her own cooking and cleaning as well. So as your house guest,  what exactly is she not cleaning up after herself in regards to?", "YTA. If I'm helping out a friend or family member by letting them stay with me I would hope/expect that they would not add to my workload so cleaning up after themselves I would expect. I wouldn't however expect them to participate in home improvement projects or yard work, especially if they were not feeling well.", "You came to reddit to mansplain how periods work, like you've ever experienced one yourself. You have no idea what your talking about and frankly just sound like a huge sexist AH. \n\nExpecting her to help around the house is one thing, only being mad when she doesn't and not your son, makes YTA", "I was going to side with you when I read title, then I read your complaints. YTA just for the period pain comment. But aside from that, it doesn\u2019t sound like you set any expectations upfront. And she\u2019s cleaning up after herself. Honestly, it sounds like she\u2019s trying to make herself as inconspicuous as possible. She can probably tell you don\u2019t want her there. I would avoid you too.\n\nEdit for typo", "YTA!!!  She's a guest in a time of need.  They aren't overstaying their welcome and already have a move-out date (do you know how hard it must have been to find a place that fast?).  Your son is the one that asked if they could stay with you temporarily and therefore should have been the one offering to help out more.  I notice that you have no problem with your son going out to golf \"and stuff\" with friends, leaving her alone to keep the dogs company, instead of spending his free time helping out around the house.\n\nPlus, she does help out.  She helps out when she's asked to, and she also does the cooking, cleaning, and laundry for herself and your son to minimize the impact being there has on your life.  Again, what does your son do?  She also keeps to herself and the dogs instead of risking being in your way or inconveniencing you further.  It sounds like she's being the perfect houseguest.\n\nAnd take the quote marks off of debilitating!  Many women get cramps so bad they can barely walk, and certainly shouldn't be doing any physical labor during those days.  You should be showing her concern and encouraging her to see a doctor if pain that bad is frequent.  It could be a sign of endometriosis, or a number of other serious conditions.", "YTA, you wanted your DIL to do yardwork on her period? Have you ever had period pains, OP? Seems that she takes care of herself and her husband and doesn\u2019t burden you. Why didn\u2019t YOU help your wife with the dishes?", "YTA. Since when is it mandatory for \"daughter in law\" to help around the house. If you felt bad for washing the dishes, why didn't you get up and do it? You or your wife could nicely ask her to help if absolutely necessary.There is a way to go around things.\n\n Also, please repeat to yourself - someone's \"debilitating\" period is none of your business.", "YTA, read your own post, it has a long list of things she does around the house.

Why are you only expecting this of your DIL?\n\nYour DIL was in pain so could not help cutting down trees. FYI, if she has never done tree removal, that is a dangerous job on a good day. \n\nShe cooks her own food. She does her own dishes. She does her own laundry. She is NOT your servant. YTA!", "YTA. You said she never helps off her own back, then listed all the help she does...", "YTA\n\nWhy dont YOU go and help YOUR wife!?", "INFO: Why couldn't you help your wife with the dishes?", "YTA - It's one thing to expect a guest to clean up after themselves, which you say she does, or to think they should offer to help clean up after a family meal. If that was the complaint I would say NTA, but you lose me at the expectation she would offer to help with cutting down trees when she is just a temporary guest. Then to be so dismissive of the very real pain she was dealing with makes you even more TA. When opening your home to someone any expectations of the guests while they are in your home should be expressed clearly and upfront. They are your guest, not your maid or landscaper.", "YTA. She does her own cooking, does their laundry, and does their dishes. If they were living with you long term it would be reasonable for her to help with things like yard maintenance, but as it is they are short term guests while they were displaced by an unforeseen emergency.", "Everyone is a bit of an AH but YTA the most.\n\nFirst, why does the daughter in law have to help with dishes? Why is your wife doing them and not you or your son? Reading between the lines this all sounds really sexist. The fiancee does laundry and she cleans up after herself, but you also want her to be doing household chores as well? That's fine, but why do you assume she will automatically know all of the plans that are in your head? \n\nIf she does chores when asked, then just ask her and stop yelling at her. The son was right to take her side.", "YTA because you yourself said that she cleans up after herself. Or are you upset because she doesn\u2019t clean up after you?", "YTA- if you wanted them to do chores then you needed to state that when they needed to come stay.. LOL FYI they are NOT responsible for your yard work either.   How about you actually be an adult and TALK to people rather then being so rude.", "YTA. She can't read your mind, if you wanted her to help more then why didnt you say anything? She might have wanted to not get in the way since it's YALLS house.", "YTA - Sounds like your son doesn't help either. Do you also do the dishes? Laundry? Cleaning?  \n\nSmells like you think the ladies should do more around the house.  \n\nI get that- as a long term guest- you would expect her to do some things to help. But manual backyard labor? Sounds like you asked her to clean up after dinner she did not partake in?  \n\nBut she keeps her areas clean, manages their laundry, and cleans up after herself? Just wanted to make sure I had it all straight.  \n\nThey are in a crisis and you are causing a divide. Seems like this isnt the first either based on her reaction. If you want to ensure your son comes around often, make sure your soon to be DIL feels really welcome.", "Info: was this an expectation that you set, when they arrived?", "YTA, its not that shes not looking after herself and your son. You are expecting in all possibility your son's guest to help out at your home when she clearly doesn't want to. Its like if your son visits her home and stays there for a few days, her dad expects him to do house work and help out. If she wants she can but expecting it as some sort of mandatory code does make you the bad guy.", "YTA\n\nYou want her cutting down trees with you? This has nothing to do with her staying at your house...\n\nYou also said they both cook for themselves normally and do  any dishes they make. It definitely sounds like you over reacted.", "YTA. Most parents would be happy to help their son and his fiance after they had such a heartbreaking disaster, but you're only interested in how much work you can wring out of them.", "Info - does your son also contribute to the household chores?", "It sounds like you are mad that she isn't doig the \"women's\" work around the house. Have you considered she could be on doctors orders? That period pain is serious? That you ignored both your wife and son?\n\nYTA and need to listen a whole lot more than letting lose your impotent and uninformed rage.", "YTA.  Your daughter in law has a full time job and she cleans up after herself and your son.  In what world does that constitute \u201cnot doing anything\u201d?\n\nIf you had other expectations about what your daughter in law AND your son should be doing while they stayed with you, you should have communicated that up front.", "YTA.\n\nEstablish what you expect from your son and DIL in return for letting them stay with you, and then let them determine how exactly to divide responsibility. As it is, your DIL sounds plenty busy doing the housework for her portion of the family while your son goes golfing.", "YTA if you didn\u2019t put any expectations up front.\n\nWhen I stay at my in-laws I do my own laundry, take care of my dog and children, and that\u2019s it. I offer to help cook or clean up after dinner and if my offer is accepted, I\u2019ll gladly do those things. My husband helps with any chores he\u2019s been asked to.\n\nWhen they stay at my house, they do nothing.\n\nEta rest since I pressed enter to quick.\n\nThis is what we\u2019ve discussed as our expectations for each other in our respective homes.", "YTA. Sounds to me she is just trying to stay out of your way and not inconvenience you. I also hope you don't expect her to do things because she is a woman.", "I have no idea what your issue is. You listed all the things she does to contribute around the house. Then you somehow say she\u2019s doing nothing. You\u2019re just making shit up to be offended over. YTA.", "YTA. You say she cleans up after herself and your son but apart from helping with yard work what\u2019s your son done oh that\u2019s right golf. But it\u2019s ok for you and your son to sit on your asses while your wife does the dishes but the other woman in the house should be in the kitchen too cleaning and cooking and looking after their men cause that\u2019s all we women are good for right. And by the way the sarcasm over Period pain are you freaking kidding me. Your balls drop and your voice gets a bit deeper and you men think you have it hard you have no idea what women go through.
