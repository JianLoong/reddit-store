He moved here almost a decade ago with his parents who came here on a corporate work visa, so it goes without saying that everyone in his household speaks perfect english. They also natively speak two other languages that they frequently flow between when it\u2019s just them. I am trying to learn the languages, but it\u2019ll be at least a year before I can fully understand what\u2019s being said, let alone engage in their banter. Especially because I have to learn two at once to actually keep up with the conversations.\n\nLet me make this clear, the issue is **NOT** that they speak in different languages. I think it\u2019s beautiful and it pushes me to learn more about the languages and the cultures. \n\nHere is my issue:  I am so tired of being invited to outings with them and for 30 minutes at a time, I can\u2019t engage in or even understand what\u2019s being said. It\u2019s different when I\u2019m over at their house for a birthday or a holiday because when they start speaking in their native tongues, I can just go to another room and be on my phone for the next 1.5 hrs while they forget that I\u2019m there. But when it\u2019s the four of us at brunch or something, I find myself battling with the idea of bringing out my phone when they get wrapped up in their conversations for 30 minutes at a time because I don\u2019t want to seem rude (I was raised to not be on my phone during family outings), and end up just staring into the ether until someone realizes I haven\u2019t said a word for the past half hour and goes back to English. \n\nI can\u2019t turn down the family outings because his mom is very sensitive and if I turn down an invite, she begins to think I don\u2019t like her. So I asked my boyfriend one day after another brunch of me sitting in silence if he could try to refrain from speaking other languages when we do these family outings so I can actually be apart of them, and he told me that hurt his feelings because he wants to be able to speak in his native language whenever he gets the chance.\n\nI understand his argument, but I just don\u2019t see the point of inviting me out just to exclude me from the conversations for a rather large chunk of time. They also only do it with me. I have been with them to outings with their english speaking friends and they very rarely speak in their native languages, and if they do, they translate what was said because they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be rude.\u201d\n\nAnyway, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678501597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o8ax9/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_speak_english/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said she\u2019s sensitive, so maybe she\u2019ll understand.

It was telling that you said his mum would be hurt if you turned down the invite. I can see where your boyfriend gets his fragility from.\n\nPersonally, I would get out my phone, put my earbuds in and start phoning my friends or family and have a chat to them until these three dullards come back to the room.\n\nI have known many many people who are in such relationships as yours. NONE of them have treated the non-language speaker as your boyfriend and his family treat you.\n\nOf course your boyfriend wants to use the languages he has and he has every right to do so but not at the expense of others who cannot participate. He can speak to them on his own or call them. This is about his, and their, control of you and wanting to put you in your place.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you're actively making an effort to learn and they're inviting you places while knowing that you are going to be excluded for long periods of time.", "NTA\n\nVery odd that they would only do it when you are present.

Otherwise he can translate to his mother why you are no longer coming around.", "I speak several languages, of which English isn't my first. Juggling several languages in a conversation is difficult, particularly when one is the native one. They're not purposely excluding you, but I understand why you feel excluded. \n\nYour desire to be included in the conversation is natural. I applaud your effort in leaning BF's native languages. I understand that takes time, particularly when they're not closely related, not an unusual thing in European languages.\n\nI see two things to it: it isn't unreasonable to ask during the conversation to switch to English, and explain why. Also: as soon as you got the basics of one of the languages, try to join the conversation in that language. Don't be ashamed if you make mistakes or need to use baby words. Speaking it is by far the best way to learn a language.\n\nNAH and good luck.", "NTA. If your boyfriend is excluding you for long stretches of time, he is not invested in your feelings. Find someone better. My wife talks to her mother in a different language than English due to her mother\u2019s limited proficiency. However, both do try to shift it to English for my benefit as much as possible. \n\nThe point being - he may be talking in another language because it\u2019s easier, but he\u2019s also excluding you and taking you for granted. Frankly I don\u2019t understand why he invites you if he seemingly doesn\u2019t value your presence?", "NTA.  But I would get one of the instant translation apps on my phone and pop in a Bluetooth earbud so I knew what they are saying almost instantaneously.

If that's the case, you need a new boyfriend.", "NTA someone needs to translate or explain to his mother your absence.", "NTA. Two things are probably happening here:\n\n1) Parents and son are happy to talk to one another in their native language. They get carried away and might forget/be less aware that they are not including you by speaking non-English. \n2) They see this as an opportunity to have a conversation in their native language for once, which takes less brain power. They believe you don\u2019t mind this because you are quiet and don\u2019t insert yourself in the convo. \n\nEither way, I would think of a way to politely ask questions about what they are talking about, showing that you are interested in participating. If they are talking about personal topics, they shouldn\u2019t be doing this in a group setting. Phone calls would be better.", "NTA - but your boyfriend sounds a bit like one.  If they live in the same town or close enough y'all can do brunches and stuff - can he not go visit the and chatter away in his language?  They make concessions for other people but not you.  Why is that?  You are working on learning their language and they can't refrain from being really rude and excluding you in a social situation?  Your boyfriend sounds petulant and tedious and you think about how you might feel about that after a while.", "Hmmmmmmm\u2026 Definitely NTA. \n\nBut I suspect one of a few things.. They\u2019re chatting in the other languages about you. The only reason I say that is because you\u2019re saying it\u2019s only happening with you and they are more than willing to translate and apologize when they do it to other friends and guests.. \n\nOR\n\nThey may feel extremely comfortable with you to speak those language openly and not be judged so they may fail to realize that they\u2019re speaking their mother tongue so much and are oblivious to how much they exclude you.\n\nOR\n\nThey may do it to purposely exclude you because they don\u2019t want you involved in their conversations.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s definitely rude. You could approach calmly and explain to them that you feel excluded and unacknowledged and ask them to translate for you the same way they do for others or you could start excluding yourself from the outings. Or better yet.. tell them you\u2019ve got better things to do than be ignored and excluded.", "Honestly it's more rude they don't speak in a language everyone understands! I speak a second language and ut of courtesy I speak a language the whole group understands at work/outings.", "ESH. If you actually respected and validated his heart language, you wouldn't ask him not to speak it, you would ask to arrange a signal by which you could subtly remind him you'd like him to translate a bit and let you in on the topic or joke. \n\nIf your boyfriend valued your input and participation, he would make more effort to include you in the conversation. \n\nI love seeing my husband's enjoyment when he speaks with his family in his mother tongue. My deal with him is just that if they are going to ask my opinion on a topic (to include me), he give a super brief (10-15 sec) English summary of what has been said so I don't make a fool of myself blithely espousing an opinion they've spent the last 10 minutes criticizing.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
