This is because I used drugs as a teenager due to severe bipolar disorder and they were embarrassed by me. I obviously accept responsibility for doing the drugs, but I feel like my parents should bare some responsibility as they neglected me, and their partners (my stepdad and stepmother) were abusive towards me.\n\nI got clean and started working for a law firm as a receptionist. There, I met my now fianc\u00e9 Mark (48M). We became friends, and he convinced me to go to university to get my degree and my dream job as a teacher. I left the company when I was 23 when I began to officially train as a teacher but I kept in touch with Mark. We had our son together when I was 25 when we weren't in a relationship, and then we started dating and I gave birth to our daughter two months ago. Now, we're engaged. \n\nWhen I was 2 months pregnant with my daughter, I ran into my father and stepmother. We live in neighboring cities so there was always a tiny chance of this happening. I thought they were just going to ignore me, but my dad stopped me and he was pretty tearful. Turns out he had been searching for me, but because I have a low social media presence, he couldn't find me. My mother (who lives in a different country) was also looking for me, so he put me in touch with her and we slowly tried to rebuild our relationship. It was not an easy process, and when they found out I no longer followed the religion I was raised in, they cut me off again and we only started speaking again when I was 8 months pregnant.\n\nMy family is very traditional and they care about their reputation a lot, so I was worried about how they would react to their daughter having two children with an older man she wasn't married to. We also haven't managed to work through what happened when I was 18, and I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them and any misstep might cause me to be cut off again. Because of this, I decided to not tell them I had children or that I was engaged until we got closer and they accepted that I will never have the traditional life they wanted for me. \n\nEver since I reconnected with my father, the amount of times I ran into him have increased exponentially. He seems to visit the city I live in a lot more, and unfortunately he ran into my fianc\u00e9, me and our two children on father's Day when we went out to eat. He sent me a text asking for an explanation and I told him that I was waiting until we were closer to introduce my family.\n\nNow, he and my mother are very angry with me, saying that I acted in bad faith because I didn't tell them the truth. They said the purpose of reconnecting is to tell the truth so we can move forward in our relationship with eachother. They also said it seemed like I hadn't learned my lesson from hiding my addiction from them as a teen which makes me feel terrible.

Quite frankly, I would not want people like them in my life, much less in my children's lives.\n\nThey also haven't learned from their mistakes.\n\nTime to stand up for yourself, and disown them.", "NTA. As a parent, it is your responsibility to choose when to introduce new people into their lives.  Remind him that they disowned you when you were a teen, and you have no intention to allow them to be part of your children's lives until you are certain that the past will not be repeating itself. The fact that his immediate reaction is anger that your haven't \"learned your lesson\" about \"hiding \" things from him seems to indicate that he sees himself as an authority figure entitled to know (and perhaps dictate?) all your business.", "NTA You chose to protect your kids because they've cut you off twice so you didn't want them coming into your kids lives then cutting them off when they were pissed off at you. \n\nYou don't owe them tang information and they need to learn that the moment they cut you off the second time they missed out on knowing.\n\nIf you don't want them in your life tell them tang their own actions have consequences and they need to live with these consequences of not knowing about both YOUR kids and fianc\u00e9e. \n\nSounds liek your better off without any of them in your lives.

They probably wanted to rope you in in their lifestyle of whatever religion they live in, and be in control again. Dont let them.", "OP this is above reddits pay grade. There is a lot to unpack. Your addiction, your mental illness, their parenting, abusive step parents\u2026 it\u2019s not something AITA can answer for you. But 100% you are not the AH for taking your time to open back up to them. And that\u2019s the conversation you need to have. Can you and your parents rebuild your relationship? Only if you\u2019re all honest about your intentions. It sounds like you\u2019re concerned they\u2019ll abandoned you again out of shame. As painful as it would be there\u2019s no point in a relationship where you can\u2019t be you. At the same time, they aren\u2019t necessarily in the wrong for not trusting you/feeling like you\u2019re hiding. The things addicts can do to their families in the middle of their addictions are really damaging to those relationships and any trust in the future. If I were you I would flat out tell them what you said here. I didn\u2019t tell you because I thought you\u2019d be too embarrassed of me due to your traditional beliefs and I couldn\u2019t handle that right now. THEN if they can\u2019t find a way to work with you it\u2019s time for you to consider the value in a relationship with them going forward.", "NTA. They are overstepping way too hard.

It is not your responsibility to conform to expectations that make them look good to people who are just like them. You've got a life now: enjoy it.", "NTA. You\u2019ve had plenty of good reasons to keep your distance, and it\u2019s worrying that your parents intend to stomp on every boundary possible.", "Absolutely positively NTA and you have very good reasons for keeping them all at arm\u2019s length for the time being, if not forever. They failed you as parents and then blame you. You don\u2019t owe them anything including an explanation of your now adult life, family or your children!! Congratulations on bettering your life!

It's hard to really judge the background here but you are a self-sufficient adult with a distant, at best, relationship with your parents. It is absolutely your call, and your decision, around what information you share with them and you owe them nothing at this point. It seems like rather than using this as an inflection point and trying to look forward, they continue to, perhaps more subtly, fall back on old patterns including judging you harshly and unfairly. \n\nI mean think about this for a second - you made the cautious choice not to introduce people who you are not close with, and who haven't treated you all that well, to impressionable young children in your life, and their tactic is to suggest you are being inappropriately secretive or deceptive? Man, they are deluded. \n\nThey will have whatever role in your life that YOU want them to have. If they don't turn into actually supportive and positive people, that role should be null.", "NTA.\n\nNot going to comment on the past history because we only have a snippet from one side.\n\nBut from the perspective of introducing your family, you have to be comfortable to do it on your time schedule as you build trust and relationship again.", "NTA. You owe them NOTHING.", "NTA. I grew up in a very strict religious house and cut off contact with my family once I was free of their cult so this resonates with me. Don't let them shame you into rejoining their bubble. No matter the issues you had as a young adult, you're all older now and its a whole new adult relationship to build. Take care of yourself, your mental health, and your nuclear family first.", "NTA your parents don\u2019t have the best track record with their behavior by your account and so I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to introduce them to your family right away. Honestly I would keep that at arms length anyway because of the history of abuse and neglect especially if there has been no change on their end or apology.\n\nI\u2019m proud of you for your recovery! Drugs especially in combo with a mental illness like Bipolar is rough to deal with as is even without the added bonus of no support. Did they even try to get you any help or was it straight to disownment? Because if it\u2019s the latter definitely continue to keep them at arms length.", "You wouldn't owe them that if they had changed and accepted responsibility and apologized for how they treated you as a kid and teen\n\nThey didn't even do that; they're still judgmental and see your rift as your fault and now you're walking in eggshells to avoid them leaving you again.\n\nHow are they reconnecting the way they claim you need to be if they cut you off again within the last year? Why do they assume you need to put work into reconnecting when they cut you off to begin with?\n\nYou're definitely NTA here, and it's awful you're in this position at all & not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to protect yourself from their actions, past, present, and future. You have an obligation to protect your children from them if you perceive them as a threat.\n\nThey want unfettered access to every aspect of your life as reconciliation. What are they offering? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like anything resembling apologies for their past actions, unconditional love, and support for your decisions are on the table. It\u2019s not really an equal exchange.", "NTA. Your parents sound very controlling and kicking teenager out of the house is plain evil.", "NTA\n\nThey don't get to make demands when they're the ones requesting reconciliation. You didn't even ask for them back in your life, you just happened to be in the same area and THEY cut you off cuz you left their church. Now THEY say you gotta do this, do that, be sorry for this & that....\n\nNOPE.\n\nI'd lock it all back down again because they're going to use your babies to play with your emotions. You didn't need them a few years ago and you don't need them now. Drop 'em.", "Seems like THEY haven\u2019t learned THEIR lesson of cutting people or on a whim. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nGetting disowned from your family is hard. Its also hard for a family to actually get to that point also, so I wonder what actually happened around the time with your relationship with them to get to this point. Most families doing drugs isn't a good enough reason on its own, so sorry I'm a bit suspicious. \n\nAll that said this seems to be something harder on you than them. I don't think they have actually processed everything and are just excited about the idea of grandchildren.
