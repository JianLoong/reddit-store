This is because I used drugs as a teenager due to severe bipolar disorder and they were embarrassed by me. I obviously accept responsibility for doing the drugs, but I feel like my parents should bare some responsibility as they neglected me, and their partners (my stepdad and stepmother) were abusive towards me.\n\nI got clean and started working for a law firm as a receptionist. There, I met my now fianc\u00e9 Mark (48M). We became friends, and he convinced me to go to university to get my degree and my dream job as a teacher. I left the company when I was 23 when I began to officially train as a teacher but I kept in touch with Mark. We had our son together when I was 25 when we weren't in a relationship, and then we started dating and I gave birth to our daughter two months ago. Now, we're engaged. \n\nWhen I was 2 months pregnant with my daughter, I ran into my father and stepmother. We live in neighboring cities so there was always a tiny chance of this happening. I thought they were just going to ignore me, but my dad stopped me and he was pretty tearful. Turns out he had been searching for me, but because I have a low social media presence, he couldn't find me. My mother (who lives in a different country) was also looking for me, so he put me in touch with her and we slowly tried to rebuild our relationship. It was not an easy process, and when they found out I no longer followed the religion I was raised in, they cut me off again and we only started speaking again when I was 8 months pregnant.\n\nMy family is very traditional and they care about their reputation a lot, so I was worried about how they would react to their daughter having two children with an older man she wasn't married to. We also haven't managed to work through what happened when I was 18, and I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them and any misstep might cause me to be cut off again. Because of this, I decided to not tell them I had children or that I was engaged until we got closer and they accepted that I will never have the traditional life they wanted for me. \n\nEver since I reconnected with my father, the amount of times I ran into him have increased exponentially. He seems to visit the city I live in a lot more, and unfortunately he ran into my fianc\u00e9, me and our two children on father's Day when we went out to eat. He sent me a text asking for an explanation and I told him that I was waiting until we were closer to introduce my family.\n\nNow, he and my mother are very angry with me, saying that I acted in bad faith because I didn't tell them the truth. They said the purpose of reconnecting is to tell the truth so we can move forward in our relationship with eachother. They also said it seemed like I hadn't learned my lesson from hiding my addiction from them as a teen which makes me feel terrible.

Live your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA, they were already abusive and then abandoned you during the lowest point of your life when you needed support the most, they don\u2019t deserve to see your children", "NTA, but your parents compared your past addiction to your kids. I get you might be lonely, but unless you honestly think they are going to enrich the lives of your children, it doesnt seem worth the aggravation to introduce them.", "nta yikes on their part", "NTA. Think about your kids. What if they grow close to their grandparents, and then you take a misstep and get cut off again. They would be confused and hurt. What you did was perfectly acceptable from that point of view. I can understand that your parents are dissappointed, but your children come first.\n\nYou have been burned so many times, it will be so very hard to open up again. And they should understand that, and they apparently aren\u2019t. They wanna do this on their terms, not on yours. You need to make boundaries, and maintain them. You have a life, you have love, you have children! Protect those when moving forward with your parents.", "[removed]", "Time to stand up for yourself, and disown them.", "right, they threw you out, ask them what have they done to earn your trust.", ">NTA-congratulations on your sobriety .\n\nThank you :)\n\n>You should go to therapy to help you deal with the loss of your family\n\nI've been shopping around for a good therapist, I'm hoping I find a good one soon.\n\n\n>Men in their 40\u2019s who go after young secretaries is still pretty cringe.\n\nWe only became involved with eachother when a year into me being a teacher when I was 24.", "Stupid comment. Learn some nuance.", "It was diagnosed when I was a teenager. It runs in my mother's family but it's treated like a shameful secret", "I was only planning on introducing them if my parents and I stayed in contact for more than a year, and they changed their behaviour. I don't think either will happen at this rate so they probably won't be meeting my kids", "They are not good parents, and will only bring you headaches and hurt your family.", "If you don't want them in your life, tell them that there are consequences for their own actions and that they will have to live with those consequences of not knowing about both your children and fiance.", "So you'd rather compromise your peace of mind, your partners peace of mind, and your children's wellbeing and upbringing?? Think about all they did to you as a kid, do you really want your kids to go through the same?", "Do you have a close group of friends? I am also NC with my family and having friends and a career I\u2019m passionate in makes me not miss my family at all.", "No, you want the concept of them back. You want A family, not THAT family.", "But what happens when they do the same to your children? They have dropped you so many times, do you honestly think they won't do it again? Why would you let your children grow a relationship with people who can cut them off at any moment? I appreciate you were using, and I have no doubt that they were pushed the first time, but your use was because *they* medically neglected you and *they* allowed your step parents to abuse you.\n\nHoney, I know you miss having a family around you, but you will be doing your children a huge disservice to allow them around neglectful, abusive people who use your love as a way to hurt you. Now it can't be about what you want: it has to be about what is best for your children. Please break the cycle and be the parent yours should have been to you.\n\nSending you my love, and I really hope you make a good decision here.", "Sweetheart the best 'family' are the ones we make. Close friends, good kind coworkers, pretty much anyone would be healthier for you and your little family than these people.\n\nYou miss the feeling of family, but these people don't know how to love you like family. Understand what I mean?? You would NEVER do to your kids or partner what these people have done to you. And they clearly have not changed. They may feel some sort of remorse (probably from having to explain why they have an MIA kid...) but they don't miss you. They don't even KNOW you.\n\nThey only care about their preconceived perceptions of you and those were wrong even a decade ago.", "Not pathetic. However, they don\u2019t like you. They kicked you out. They are not good parents, and will only bring you headaches and hurt your family.", "You have biological predecesors, not parents.\n\nLonely or not, you need a family, not whatever they are.", "They don\u2019t want you though, they want the version of you that they have contrived. Of course you\u2019re NTA and I would say you shouldn\u2019t expose your children to them. You have no idea when they\u2019ll drop out of your lives. That would hurt the kids. Good luck", "Take your time, nothing wrong with caution, especially as an addict", "Ultimately OP you have to decide if this is worth the impact it may have on your kids directly or indirectly\u2026your mental health as well as their influence they may have directly through their behavior", "You'll only get the abuse back. Your biological parents will never be the parents you long for. But they are lots of other nice, kind, loving people out there.", "You don't want them back, you want the idea of a family in your life. It's understandable, and I sympathize, but do not expose yourself and your children to toxicity in the hopes of positivity. \n\nEngage in your community and build a family of friends you can rely and lean on, but don't subject your growing family to people who they'll never be able to please. It will only lead to continued disappointment", "What is his family like? Do they accept you?", "So u married a creepy incel lmfao. As soon as u get old he\u2019ll dump u for someone younger. Men like him r disgusting", "Disregard the silly value judgement placed on age gap. It sounds very much like the two of you had an extremely solid foundation on which to base a relationship (being friends first, supportive of you following your dreams) and that\u2019s far more indicative of a sturdy relationship than age. Reddit can\u2019t bear age gaps at the best of times. There was 19 years between my parents and my dad was left devastated when my mum passed away at the young age of 54. Real love is real.", "They are not good parents, and will only bring you headaches and hurt your family.", "Thank you \ud83e\ude75 I need to keep reminding myself that they'll never change", "Kinda heartless to assume someone can \u201cnever change.\u201d I went low contact with my mom in my 20\u2019s.  A few years later I realized that, yeah, I was lonely, and wound up reaching out to my mom. She had done a complete 180, and was a kind and loving presence in my life until she died last year.", "I\u2019m worried that that is exactly what will happen. I\u2019m scared for OP and her children.", "They are not good parents, and will only bring you headaches and hurt your family.", "Not really. I've made some friends at a mother's group I go to so hopefully I will soon", "It just hammers home the fact that this dude is, at the very least,", "Yeah they love me. They're amazing people", "Do you even know what incels are?", "Hey just out of curiosity how old were you when you met him?", "People on Reddit are always extremely dismissive of huge age gaps between partners, even when it has nothing to do with the issue submitted.\n\n6 years is indeed a long time to get to know someone. If you feel you are in a healthy relationship, that makes you thrive as a person, don't let that bother you. It does look like he had a very positive influence on you by getting you to follow your dream of becoming a teacher.", "So you\u2019re admitting he essentially groomed you?", "There's a distinction between wanting a large family and wanting *that* family. You don't want them specifically, you want people who love you. They can't give you what you want because they can't show you love in a healthy way.", "That\u2019s brilliant! But rare.", "I hope you meet someone kind! The reason I asked is because I use to roll over to try to please my family. I didn\u2019t have any close friends so they were all I had for human connection beyond my boyfriend/ now husband. Once I directed my efforts to making friends and formed my own \u201cfamily\u201d, I was able to see that I was much happier without the weight of carrying on the dead relationship I had with my biological family. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should cut your family off! I don\u2019t know you or them. But perhaps focus your energy in to yourself a bit more and see if being in your parents life again is truly within your best interest. You\u2019re also engaged now, have you thought about how your parents could affect your relationship with him and your kids? Please prioritize your happiness and don\u2019t let old relationships jeopardize your current ones. Good luck!", "Sounds like you have a family.", "Yep they just want young women to have sex with. Good luck getting old", "Please let's  focus on the question OP asked, which is about her parents and not her fiance. Furthermore while it's a bit unusual,  some May-December relationships actually do work out well, so let's not pile into her about her choice of partner.", "Nearly 19. We were friends until I was 24. We hooked up, had our son, and then started dating.", ">It does look like he had a very positive influence on you by getting you to follow your dream of becoming a teacher.\n\nHe's the best influence. I did not believe in myself at all and he made me realise that my past doesn't have to determine my future.", "No? I met him when I was nearly 19. He encouraged me to go to university and get a better job. He only showed romantic interest in me when I was a more stable and confident person. Groomers go after weak and vulnerable people that they can easily manipulate. If he was a weirdo, he would have gone after me when I was vulnerable, not when I finally had my life together.", "Ron DeSantis has entered the chat.", "No, that's a predator. An incel is, according to Google\n'a member of an online community of young men who consider themselves unable to attract women sexually, typically associated with views that are hostile towards women and men who are sexually active'. \n\nMy fiance is neither an incel or a predator.", "You are a deeply weird person and this comment added nothing to the conversation.", "Weak and vulnerable people include teenage addicts who don\u2019t have family to help. He was just biding his time.", "Yeah, watching and helping someone grow up from the age of 19 and on while being 20+ years senior their age, really sounds a lot like grooming.", "Calling consenting adults perverts also doesn\u2019t add to the conversation. You have no right to judge OP\u2019s private consensual relationship like that.", "Biding his time until I got my degree, started a good career and became financially stable? A predator would not do that"]}
