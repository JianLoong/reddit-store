Best thing to do would be to have a word with her on the side instead of making it a public display.  You completely lost the plot.", "You should have just removed the offensive dish and not made a big production out of it. What you did was very rude.

You could've handled this with some semblance of tact and grace by simply removing the dish from the buffet table and pulling her aside quietly to explain why. Instead, you felt the need to publicly shame, humiliate and embarrass her. That makes you a bully, too, which makes you the worst kind of AH.", "NTA\nWhat the hell? All these E S H/Y T A votes are wild.\nHopefully you dumped it before anyone else ate any of it.", "Info: did you make a spectacle of throwing it away and informing her of the reason?

Not for throwing the dish out, but for making her cry?? Like??? \u201cAre you trying to make us all sick?\u201d That\u2019s so rude wtf.", "NTA for throwing the dish away so no one else would get dog-hair flavored mash. Maybe you could have handled it better so as not to publicly humiliate this woman. Still, she needed to know and hear her food was contaminated. She's become too comfortable with eating dog hair, I guess. \n\nPersonally, I have had dogs in my life for years and years. My dogs sleep in the bed with me. Sometimes I end up with dog hair in my mouth just from breathing in my own bed. But it doesn't bother me. If I found one of my own dog's hairs in my food, I would probably just pick it out (but not if the food was infused with the hair, as you describe. Then I would throw it away). It is gross, yes, but it is my dog's hair. Kind of like how if you made a sandwich and found one of your own hairs lying atop it, you might just pick it off and eat, but if you went to a shop and got a sandwich and found a hair atop it, you would throw it away. Like I said, I think this woman has forgotten that not everyone is comfortable with such a situation, or her housely hygiene is so poor she couldn't keep the dog hair out of the food.", "YTA for the way you went about it. You could have pulled the dish into the kitchen and asked the guest to come help you with something. Then quietly (AWAY from everyone else) let her know about the hair. Like in a five second conversation, don\u2019t draw it out. Then lead her back out and loudly start talking about something else to her to integrate her back into the party and move on. \n\n\nTact. That\u2019s called tact.", "NTA for throwing away a full dish at a potluck because of dog hair. I would've thanked you had I been a guest.", "If you made a dramatic production of removing the potatoes from the table ESH.\n\nIf you quietly removed them and gave people a polite excuse before dog lady made a fuss NTA.", "ESH, so yes that is absolutely revolting having all that hair in it and she sucks for not making sure the food was safe to eat. Tossing it right in front of people isn't really the correct reaction", "ESH Sure, she should have been more careful with her food prep. Nobody likes getting hair in their food and it can spoil the experience. \n\nBut you also said nobody explained the rules to her.  To go and call her out like that and make a public show was a complete AH move. All you had to do was tuck the dish away until later and if she asked, privately explain the situation.  Instead, you made a huge show of treating her poorly. Was your intention to embarrass her in front of everyone?", "They have this insane no-homecooked-food rule for their potlucks because one of OP's friends (or maybe it was OP) **literally poisoned everyone else**. This is the reason for their insane no-homemade food  rule. But the lady with the dog hair needs to be publicly humiliated. \n\nINFO: I think I might not be alone in feeling that I need to hear the food poisoning story and how things proceeded from there for the perpetrator.\n\nIt's unlikely to affect my judgment -- YTA -- but it is still important context.", "ESH but like 90-10. I would have said N T A except you coulda just told her about the dog hair and returned it in the unlikely event that she didn\u2019t care and would eat it herself (which I doubt but given her reaction who knows). Other than that N T A.", "YTA. She didn't know about the rule and while yes, the dog hair in the food is really gross, you absolutely didn't have to make a scene and humiliate her in front of a bunch of people. You could have quietly talked to the host about it or just asked the person who brought them to help you warm them up in the kitchen area and then quietly mentioned the hair once you were away from people or something. Instead you were an asshole to her.", "YTA, and you know the people cooking for you at the stores and restaurants can give you food poisoning as well right? Your rule about no homemade food is ridiculous and protecting no one.", "Are you a wirdo for the resturant food potluck. Yes\n\nAre you an AH for how you reacted? Also yes\n\nThis is a YTA or ESH", "YTA. She didn\u2019t know the rule and clearly didn\u2019t know there was hair in the dish. You could\u2019ve discreetly put the dish away and pulled her to the side and told her. Instead, you made a scene and humiliated her. You may have been \u201cin the right\u201d to do what you did, but it doesn\u2019t make you any less of an ass.", "YTA. That was rude as hell. You could have just pulled the food off and took her aside and let her know what the issue was. Possibly even showing her the hair so she would be aware and maybe take it away herself. \n\nInstead you dramatically cut the line to toss the food in the trash seemingly out of the clear blue sky. Of course you\u2019re going to get yelled at. Then you yell at her about the dog hair in front of everyone, humiliating her. Of course she\u2019s going to cry. \n\nWhat the hell, dude? Do you live in a soap opera?", "Accidents happen to all of us all the time. You treated her like she did this on purpose. Yes it's gross, yes she should have been more careful but imagine being reamed out by someone for an innocent mistake. Soooo many other ways you could have dealt with this but you chose to lash out. YTA", "YTA. Not because you didn't want to eat the dish. But because you were rude. There's no reason you couldn't have discretely let the person know. There's no reason to have caused a scene.", "YTA for what you said and for throwing the dish away. You should have put a cover on it, picked it up and brought it to the fridge or other room. Then discreetly speak to the dish maker about the issue.\n\nIF other people in line see you hauling it away and ask why, you can say \u201coh, sorry, I had noticed a couple hairs in it and I wanted to mention that to Jane\u201d. \n\nYou don\u2019t throw away her food and ask if she\u2019s trying to make people sick. What a horrible and immature response.", "YTA. You weren't the host and you didn't bring the dish. You just mention it quietly to the host and let them handle it from there.  There was no need to make a scene.  If they don't handle it, then you can, again quietly, let people know that you found a dog hair in the potatoes.", "YTA. Not for throwing out the food, but for berating her. You handled it horrifically.\n\nAs a dinner guest by all means raise a stink. But as a host, a large amount of tact is required to make the guest feel comfortable, even when the guest's behavior is far below social norms. You can say the same thing sweetly. That way it becomes a demand for her to do better.", "I\u2019ve gotten sick way more times from restaurant food than I ever have from someone\u2019s homemade dish, whether there were pets in the home or not. In fact, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever gotten sick from a meal that didn\u2019t come from a restaurant. So, YTA for having an absolutely pointless rule in the first place, and YTA again for how you handled the dish with the animal hair. You could have discreetly put it aside and let her know without humiliating her.", "YTA.  One time I got severely sick from store bought food.  \n\nAlso a dog hair can\u2019t actually make you sick.  We think it\u2019s gross but you are eating the inside of an animal (meat) so a tiny hair from the outside is nothing.", "YTA you embarrassed her needlessly over a good faith mistake. There are so many kinder ways to have handled the issue discreetly, but you seemed to feel like there wasn\u2019t enough drama and public humiliation at your potluck and wanted to ruin someone\u2019s night. Way to be a gracious host.", "ESH", "Yta it absolutely did not need to be handled that way! FFS there were so many other ways you could have handled that situation with compassion whilt still removing the item from the menu. I'm surprised you have friends to organize a potluck  with in the first place when you act like that.  Do the rest of them of them have a knack for causing a scene and being unnecessarily cruel as well?", "ESH \n\nyes that is gross but you definitely could have handled it better. also it's weird to call off homemade dishes for life over one incident? for the record you can still get food poisoning from a restaurant.", "YTA, but not because you threw it out. Because you threw it out and when people (rightly) asked why, you started accusing the person of trying to make everyone sick and tried to embarrass her. That was unnecessary.

There\u2019s nothing particularly unsanitary about eating hair. However, the majority of a potluck population will find it disgusting. It may be weird, but it\u2019s a legitimate concern for a lot of people.    \n\nPersonally, I find human hair disgusting, but animal hair is okay for me. That partially depends on the length. Short human hair is less awful than long human hair, but a short human hair is still grosser than a short animal hair. I\u2019m not sure why, but perhaps it\u2019s because you\u2019re not supposed to be eating human meat?\n\nLike if I\u2019m eating a lamb chop and I find a wee bit of animal hair in it, my brain is like, \u201chuh, meat has hair; I don\u2019t like hair, but that\u2019s an acceptable thing to find with meat.\u201d But if I find a hair, no matter what kind, in a potato salad, that\u2019s the worst thing ever. \n\nHair in a meat dish is very unpleasant, but hair in a vegetable dish is 100x worse, because vegetables don\u2019t have hair so it\u2019s extremely unnatural.\n\nI get the whole \u201cmeat is a dead animal and I hate it,\u201d vibe, and it\u2019s easy to understand why people would be bothered by eating meat. As a definite omnivore, I can absolutely recognize when I\u2019m eating the thigh of a chicken or a chunk of a cow\u2019s back, and I honestly lean into that because I feel like it\u2019s cowardly to eat meat without admitting where it\u2019s from. I love animals, and it\u2019s something that could easily bother me, but I don\u2019t let it bother me. It helps me that nearly all herbivores are opportunistic omnivores. Like if a deer can catch a chick, it\u2019ll eat that baby bird remorselessly because that\u2019s great protein.\n\nEating meat is okay, but I\u2019ll forever argue that eating human hair is worse emotionally even if it\u2019s totally sanitary, unless you\u2019re also eating human meat. We\u2019re so conditioned to not eat human meat (for very valid ethical and health reasons) that any sort of human bit in your food is gross. \n\nI\u2019ve eaten beef/pork/chicken/venison/fish/crab/ whatever. I\u2019ve never eaten dog, but if I\u2019m eating any sort of land meat, dog hair isn\u2019t bad because meat has hair and dogs have hair.\n\nAs a meat eater, I eat things that have hair that aren\u2019t people, so if I find non-people hair in meat then I can deal with it. It\u2019s interesting, because I dye my hair blue, so when I find a blue hair in a meal I know it\u2019s mine, but it\u2019s still worse because it\u2019s a human hair. Like I\u2019d honestly rather eat a dog hair than my own blue hair.\n\nBasically, there\u2019s not anything wrong with eating hair physically, but mentally and emotionally, eating hair is the worst for a variety of reasons", "On our purpose or not you should absolutely be embarrassed by that.", "They don\u2019t care and just pick it out.
