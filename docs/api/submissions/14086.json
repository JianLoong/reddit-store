I don't blame you in the slightest for not wanting to ever see him again. If your wife still wants to see him that's fine, you should support your wife with the other children and go.

And that's probably the issue your wife has. She wants to spend this day with her whole family and of course that includes you. \n\nSo its like you all go or they go without you. \n\nIf you really don't want to go (which I can understand) then maybe at least call your in-laws to talk to them.

I've had to practice this in therapy before when there were people I just couldn't face.

I think what OP said makes a ton of sense...there's a problem between some adults in the family, and it really shouldn't affect the kids. I myself experienced that as a kid. There was some issue between my aunt (married to my paternal uncle, and had 2 kids from her previous marriage) and some (most? all?) adults in my family. I don't know exactly what the issues were because everyone was at least mature enough not to air grievances in detail, but they all did little to cover the fact that they were at each other's throats. So us kids were in a tough spot, we all loved each other and considered ourselves cousins (not step-cousins), but we also felt obligated to \"pick sides\" when things got especially tense...and our respective parents expected us to be on their side, of course. Drove a wedge in the family that exists to this day, and nobody is close with that set of cousins anymore, despite us being very close when we were kids. Adults need to act like adults and not let their problems/gripes/pettiness spill over onto the kids. That shit rips families apart.", "NTA.\n\nHe threw your dead child\u2019s funeral into your face as a \u201cgotcha\u201d.

You have no obligation to speak with him, nor should you - fuck that guy - but this is about your family. Your wife has a right to want a relationship with the rest of her family, and the kids have a right to have one as well.

I will admit that I avoided her for a year because the things she had said were vile and I just couldn\u2019t play nice at that point in time.", "I just about agree with everything here.\nBut the happy Easter and handshake would be too much for me to stomach.", "Since it's not at his house just go and be the man he cannot be. Stick in larger groups and meet his insecurity with indifference. $5K was his worth whole in pride. But you can be priceless.", "You do realize that you can just ignore her brother there though right?\n\nYour wife wants to go be with her family. 2 of those brothers did help you out of the goodness of their hearts will be there from the sounds of it and so will other family members who helped you during that trying time in your lives. She wants to reconnect with them. She wants her other children to be around her family too. \n\nYou are letting her brother live rent free in your head by you staying home and stewing in your anger. Just give a polite hello and and ignore him.", "Maybe go to the party, let the awkward confrontation happen, and then JUST loudly enough for people to hear, tell him you\u2019re really glad you could help him through this difficult season in his life where he has lost everything (wife, house, business, net worth, status, pride, dignity, etc) like he helped you way back when when you lost a key piece of your world. Say you understand it was hard to have to bring it up but you\u2019re touched that he took the humble road and admitted his struggles/failures so that you could now be there for him, too. And tell him, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, tiger, you\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d And then give him a manly pat on the shoulder and toast your glass to him and his future recovery from this low point. \n\nHonestly. Kill \u2018em with kindness and a healthy serving of humble pie.", "> I think she's been a doormat for her brother far too often. I'm setting a hard boundary.....and she's not comfortable with that.\n\nWhat's your 'hard boundary' *for* though? Yeah, he's a dick for what he did but you can chalk it up to a 'misunderstanding' about whether the money was a gift or a loan. You gave him back the money. Done. The 'hard boundary' in this case would be to never except anything from him again so as not to have any confusions regarding gift/not a gift in the future. Saying 'I will never, ever, ever attend your family functions or events if he will be present' is overkill and it's pure ego-rage on your part. there's no reason to go so scorched earth here. Just ignore him. You don't have to be hostile, rude or aggressive and make everyone else present feel terrible and uncomfortable. Just, like, be an adult? It's not that hard man. Don't force your wife to be a doormat to *your* dickishness.", "NTA and keep that hard boundary. If you decide to go, make it clear to everyone that you absolutely won\u2019t be associating with him in any way, shape or form!", "It sounds like the rest of the family is on the OP's side about this. Behaving like that, adding more drama to the situation, is a good way to make them think they're dealing with two AHs rather than just one.", "Someone is bound to ask at some point. All he has to say is \"I sent him a check and he cashed it, I consider the matter resolved. Did you try Aunt Susie's potato salad? It's amazing!\" State the facts, change the subject, let them draw their own conclusions on if brother is a dirtbag. Otherwise like you said he just ends up looking like an asshole too.", ">Sounds like the rest of the family wouldn't bother correcting BIL if he did start talking crap.\n\nWhere do you get this impression from? As far as I can tell, the only information about the OP's wife's family's attitude to the situation in the post are that a) the other brothers were the driving force behind the funeral donation, and that b) everyone was shocked when the AH brother demanded repayment for the decade + old funeral costs. Both of which indicate to me that the family aren't on the AH brother's side on this matter.", "Happy cake day!\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think the other siblings are in the wrong.  I wouldn\u2019t want the kids around the asshole brother.", "I think the kids deserve more credit than that. I have an unpleasant uncle--not abusive or physically inappropriate, just mean and grumpy, and involved in these weird, petty, one-sided grudges with my dad that I never understood as a kid. And he was the last person I wanted to speak to at family parties. The kids want to see their cousins and grandparents, I don't see any reason to deprive them of that just because of the AH uncle.", "Very similar situation here.  I have an aunt on my mom\u2019s side (younger sister) who basically is a golden child.  When it comes to caring for my grandmother (their mom), mom\u2019s younger sister does nothing.  Takes no initiative at all.  Only cares about projecting a false image of actually caring, while grandmother\u2019s care falls on my mom, her older sister, my dad, and me.\n\nThe relationship I have with this \u201cgolden child\u201d aunt of mine is finished.  And so is the relationship I have with her husband, kids, and grandkids.  All \u2018cause of her indifference towards what actually matters.\n\nI used to want a relationship with them badly.  That was when I was shielded.  That all ended when I was able to see what exactly was going on.  It messed me up good, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for OP\u2019s kids to have to go through something similar.  OP should shield the kids now, even if they take offense to it."]}
