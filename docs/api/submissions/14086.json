The last 2 years of his life were full of drama, complexity, hope, lost-hope, and disappointment. Dealing with all this put us in major financial setback. We had no idea how we were going to afford a funeral. My wife\u2019s three older brothers stepped forward and offered to pay for their nephew\u2019s funeral. They were all three doing well at this time with their respective businesses and it wasn\u2019t much of a sacrifice for them to do this. They literally told us, this is a gift from them to us. We were beyond grateful and expressed that on numerous occasions.\n\nMy wife is the youngest of five with 3 older brothers. Sibling rivalry like no other! And my wife, as the youngest, was always playing peacemaker. The youngest brother is the most contentious. It\u2019s like everything is a competition with that guy. \n\nThanksgiving 2021 is when things came to a head. He was there at her folks\u2019 place with everyone else. He got into a discussion with my wife that soon escalated into an argument where he threw out that we \u201cnever paid him back for his part that he paid for (our son\u2019s) funeral.\u201d Everyone in earshot was in shock he brought that up. My wife in surprise asked, if he always felt he was supposed to be paid back. He belligerently told her that was exactly what he was saying. Evidently, he had never intended to help pay for the funeral and felt forced into it by the older two brothers. I had enough and said, \u201cYou know what\u2026\u2026since you feel so strongly you have been wronged, as soon as we get home, I\u2019m going to write you a check for $5K so you can consider yourself paid in full, and with interest.\u201d Then he got defensive, like he wasn\u2019t THAT serious. We\u2019re \u201cblowing it out of proportion.\u201d Then we gathered up all of our brood and left. That next Monday, I wrote him out a check for 5K and sent it certified mail. I wondered how long it would take him to cash it. He received it on Tuesday around noon and he cashed it that afternoon. \n\nMy wife would\u2019ve totally written him off as a brother if not for the nieces and nephews. She never could stand him. I just flat refuse to be around the guy or any association with him. Not being around him since 2021 hasn\u2019t really been much of an issue. Until this week. Her family is doing a big Easter thing this weekend and wants everyone to come. And he\u2019s going to be there. I don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m not going to be social with that guy. My wife says I\u2019m being the asshole and ruining the weekend and should let it go. \n\nAnyway, things are a little tense between the two of us right now as she thinks I need to let it go.

That was a gift 19 years ago. I would ignore him at any gatherings.", "NTA, you cannot tell your wife not to go but she likewise cannot tell you that you have to be in the same room socializing with this ass hole and insisting that you go and pretend nothing happened after what he did is not defensible.  I'd probably go and not say a word to him and if he says anything to you, just walk away, and if he presses, tell him he can fuck himself after what he did.", "NTA, for 30 plus years I was the bigger person every fecking Christmas. I would help my mom fix the food and every single year NO ONE would offer to help. Once others got there I spent the rest of the day either doing dishes or sitting in another room. I never said \"Get off your damn asses and help\" because I was the bigger person and didn't want to make things awkward for my parents. If you can live with being in the room with a man that did that, more power to you.  I get the idea of happy families is enticing, but when is enough enough?", "NTA. Your wife can forgive if she wants to, but you have no obligation to hang around someone so contentious.", "I have gone something mildly similar and let me tell you something. You are in no way shape or form the AH. I am so deeply sorry for you loss, a loss that in no way anyone can comprehend. Your BIL got pushed into paying for some part of the funeral... Take it up with the two brothers that pushed him into it. What did they do tie him up, gag him and force him to the cash machine. No! That is a grown man who made a decision based off guilt and his regret is absolutely not your f&\u00a3king problem. He sounds like a nasty piece of work, uncaring, unkind and a narsasist. I don't blame you in the slightest for not wanting to ever see him again. If your wife still wants to see him that's fine, you should support your wife with the other children and go. But let it be very clear to your wife that you will support her and maintain a relationship with her family but you do not want any form of a relationship with him. It's a hill I'd die on to be honest.", "NTA \n\nThat is such a shitty situation. I understand you don't want to be around this guy. \n\nBut I agree with others that by avoiding him you avoid all the others too. And if your family wanted to show solidarity to you they would also avoid their grandparents, cousins, nieces, nephews, etc etc etc. Thats too much to ask from your wife and kids. And that's probably the issue your wife has. She wants to spend this day with her whole family and of course that includes you. \n\nSo its like you all go or they go without you. \n\nIf you really don't want to go (which I can understand) then maybe at least call your in-laws to talk to them. Like tell them you're just not over that story and it's not about them but about you being still angry with BIL. \n\nAnd if that's the case maybe be even honest and let them know that you don't want to cause a scene and ruin everything for everybody. \n\nAnd then talk to your wife and tell her the same. That you hope they have fun. You would want to come but just can't get over it for now and before you confront your BIL and cause a fight or scene you prefer to stay at home.", "NTA You're not spoiling anything, you're simply declining an invitation to spend the weekend with your wife's family including your brother in law. You're not making a stink about your wife and children going. For what it's worth, my brothers and I paid for the get together after my nephew's funeral because my sister and brother in law were tapped out. I wouldn't dream of asking to be reimbursed.", "NAH. Your wife gets to make her choices and you get to make yours. But she has a right to want to make decisions as a family that will impact how family holidays are spent. If you brought up your decision like \"this is what I'm doing\" without consideration for how this would impact family holidays, then she has a right to feel a bit  like you are making a big decision without talking to her about it. But at the same time everyone gets to decide what is best for them individually.", "YWBTA if you stay home. Go to the party, and just stay away from this guy. If your wife goes by herself, it sounds like she\u2019ll have to deal alone with any drama he might choose to start.", "She\u2019s the asshole by putting you in a predicament.\n\nNTA", "NAH, but I feel like you're just a hair of being the AH. Clearly, you BIL is an AH, but are you really willing to write off interacting with your wife's whole family just to avoid him? Can't you show up and just avoid him? Everyone is entitled to their own feelings, but in a relationship/family you have to take others into account. And this really feels like it is going to negatively impact your wife and kids. Again, I won't say you're an AH but it wouldn't hurt to be the bigger person for your family's sake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He got divorced about 5 years ago and lost a lot of his net worth and then Covid decimated his business so there is no doubt he was hurting for cash. Knowing him, he was too prideful to ask for a loan and had to make it about us owing him. While there's no doubt he is an asshole, I feel bad this has caused a rift between me and my wife. Indeed, her giving and caring nature is one of those qualities that made me fall in love with her, but I think she's been a doormat for her brother far too often.
