I don't blame you in the slightest for not wanting to ever see him again. If your wife still wants to see him that's fine, you should support your wife with the other children and go.

And that's probably the issue your wife has. She wants to spend this day with her whole family and of course that includes you. \n\nSo its like you all go or they go without you. \n\nIf you really don't want to go (which I can understand) then maybe at least call your in-laws to talk to them.

I've had to practice this in therapy before when there were people I just couldn't face.

I think what OP said makes a ton of sense...there's a problem between some adults in the family, and it really shouldn't affect the kids. I myself experienced that as a kid. There was some issue between my aunt (married to my paternal uncle, and had 2 kids from her previous marriage) and some (most? all?) adults in my family. I don't know exactly what the issues were because everyone was at least mature enough not to air grievances in detail, but they all did little to cover the fact that they were at each other's throats. So us kids were in a tough spot, we all loved each other and considered ourselves cousins (not step-cousins), but we also felt obligated to \"pick sides\" when things got especially tense...and our respective parents expected us to be on their side, of course. Drove a wedge in the family that exists to this day, and nobody is close with that set of cousins anymore, despite us being very close when we were kids. Adults need to act like adults and not let their problems/gripes/pettiness spill over onto the kids. That shit rips families apart.", "NTA.\n\nHe threw your dead child\u2019s funeral into your face as a \u201cgotcha\u201d.

You have no obligation to speak with him, nor should you - fuck that guy - but this is about your family. Your wife has a right to want a relationship with the rest of her family, and the kids have a right to have one as well.
