My sister has three daughters, and I only had one son (16M) until my youngest (6M) son was born. \r\n\nMy father\u2019s will specified that he wanted his male grandson to have his gold pocket watch (a vintage Patek Phillipe that\u2019s worth a fortune). However, he made this will years ago, before I had my second son (so of course he had two grandsons when he died). \r\n\nI got the watch on my eldest son\u2019s behalf and, as I handed to him, I proposed we find a solution to include my youngest as well. Maybe the watch can belong to both of them. Maybe we could sell it and split the money to go into their college funds. My son said I shouldn\u2019t propose anything because the watch belongs to him and I\u2019m putting him in a tough spot. I said he should consider that he\u2019s not the only grandson anymore. \r\n\nMy husband (he\u2019s the father of my youngest, not my oldest) said I was an AH to make this proposition and should just drop it.

Even your second son\u2019s father agrees with letting your older son keep his inheritance. Your younger son will never know his GF, but your older son had a relationship and memories. Leave 16 alone, you are being unfair to both him and your father\u2019s wishes.", "YTA. Belongs to the eldest son.\n\nAlso, who gives an expensive Patek to a teenager? Put it in a safety deposit box until he's older.", "YTA, why do you assume the watch will be immediately sold for the amount? Your firstborn is right, when the will was made your father had only one male grandson to whom he left his watch. I am guessing something you are omitting but is probably in the will is that he named that grandson too (very few people leave \"to my female grandchild\" without naming the child if the child was born at the time of writing the will. Basically happens only in books or drama tv shows) so him saying it is his is actually correct.", "YTA. Your father had 6 years to change the wording if he had wanted to. He didn't. That means he still intended for the watch to go to your eldest. \n\nAsking your son to give up something meant for only him is an asshole move. \n\nMost likely you got something from your father, too.  You want to share with your younger son then share your own shit.", "The way to handle this is not to pressure your son to give up this heirloom from his grandfather. The way to handle this is to look at the items your father left to *you* and, if you wish, decide on a few things to pass on to your youngest son for him to remember his grandfather by.\n\nYour oldest son is going to have more memories of his grandfather than your youngest son and the watch will mean more to him.\n\nYou should never have suggested your son give up his inheritance. Apologize and tell him you were wrong to do so. YTA.", "YTA\n\nFor putting your oldest son in that position to begin with.  It's the oldest sons 'inheritance' from his grandfather.

(I could *possibly* be wrong)", "YTA - Your son is right, it's his and you are an ah for putting him in a position to make him feel bad for taking it. Sharing the watch would never work, and selling it is insulting as it was meant to be kept as a family heirloom.", "Legally, morally and ethically it is your oldest sons. Leave him alone. You asked, he said no. No is a complete sentence. YTA if you keep harassing him about it.", "YTA.\n\nI understand wanting to be 'fair' (your idea of it), but you're ignoring multiple things, primarily your own father's wishes.\n\nBut beyond that - there *is* something special about being the first-born.

Your father made no provisions for your 6 year old. That happens. You will have to live with the decision that has been made.", "YTA, sorry but the watch is not yours to sell. Your father left it in his will to go to his grandson. Its his choice what to do with it. You should definitely drop it.", "YTA here.

Your dad could have updated his will at some point in the last 6 years had he wanted to.

Your father made his wishes VERY clear and you know he wanted his first born grandson to have the watch.

You can pretend that\u2019s not forcing him to do anything, but you\u2019d be delusional because that\u2019s a lot of pressure on your son to *do the right thing* by your definition vs *honor his grandfather\u2019s wishes* by everyone else\u2019s definition. \n\nI would strongly encourage you to *honor your grandfather\u2019s wishes* and apologize to your son for putting him in such an uncomfortable position.\n\nThe watch is \ud83d\udcaf% his and he should cherish that memory rather than you cheapen it by asking him to sell it.", "YTA.

You tried suggesting to your older son that he try to \u201cshare\u201d the inheritance somehow, and he shot you down.  You then proceeded to guilt him.\n\nLeave him alone.  He wants to keep the watch, let him keep the watch.", "INFO: Do you have access to other stuff from him? Something you can give your youngest as a way to remember grandad?", "YTA. I understand that you want both of your children to be included, but your grandfather wrote the will before the younger son was born, and solely intended it for your oldest son. Since he is the one specified in the will, he should have the most say in what is done with it. As long as he\u2019s responsible enough to keep it without damaging it, you should let your son hold onto it. Besides, you never know how it might appreciate in value down the road!", "YTA. You are prioritizing [equality over equity](https://interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/). It's not helping anyone and you should stop.\n\nThe way you're approaching it also suggests you favor your younger son as you didn't fight for girls to get an equitable share, you don't want to honor your father's wishes or the law, you're ignoring your husband and eldest son, and you think it's a good idea to *sell* an heirloom that will increase in value over time - destroying the sentimental value for the entire family and limiting the financial benefit.

Any deviation from that makes you the absolute AH", "I thought you were duty bound to abide by the terms of the Will, therefore the watch should remain with your eldest son.", "YTA big time! The watch was left to him & him alone. You say you left the decision to your son. Well you kinda haven\u2019t. You\u2019re pressuring him to sell it. If he does, you\u2019ll say it was his choice. If he decides to keep it, you\u2019ll not rest until you get your way. Emotional blackmail.", "YTA\u2026. It\u2019s his. Life isn\u2019t fair always. Way to trample on father deathbed wishes. Like wow.", "YTA - you dont seem to understand how estates and wills work.  doesnt matter your youngest wasnt around when your dad passed.  if the will specifically states its to go to male grandson at the time he passed then it goes to him and its up to him.  and why should he sell it? its an inheritance and has meaning and its up to him to decide what to do with it without your $$$ dollar signs eyes trying to force your way in.", "YTA. That's not your watch. You don't have any way over what happens to someone else's possessions. If your father wanted it left to both boys, he would have put that in the will.", "YTA. But this is why updating wills when major life events happen (like a child or grandchild being born) is really important. The pocket watch belongs to your oldest son. He is the one who decides what to do with it. \n\nI understand the flip side though, if I were the younger son, I would feel neglected and not as loved by your father. It really sucks for him.", "It is no longer yours to give, or even decide what happens to it. If your father wanted you to do that he had six years to amend his will to reflect that.

The will specifies who gets the watch, and it isn't your youngest son.

It was left to your oldest son, you have no right to tell him what he should do with it.", "YTA.  The Grandpa knew he had 2 grandsons and choose which one he wanted the watch to go to.

Your other son is 6 right?  Plenty of time your father could have changed his will.....he didn't!.\n\nWhile you didn't outright demand anything of your eldest, you used a manipulative approach to plant seeds of doubt. Thank goodness he knows that's not his responsibility.  Husband too!", "YTA - it's not your watch.  Period.  It was left to your eldest son by your father.

Your eldest son will never trust you again with anything if you get rid of his pocket watch. I would definitely put it in a safe deposit box until he is in his twenties so he doesn't do anything for us with it either ok sunshine xoxo", "YTA.  Let it go.
