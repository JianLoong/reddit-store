We are definitely AH for not fighting or cancelling when our adopted daughter wasn\u2019t explicitly invited. I have called her, apologized, and asked for forgiveness. But the question is are we also AH and narcissists because we wouldn\u2019t go sit down for a lecture about what happened on the trip? Because we feel kinda crazy like it\u2019s all us with MIL calling us narcissists on Facebook. ]\n\n(EDIT 1) trip meant we could not book a vacation to celebrate our ten year wedding anniversary. I do sound a bit harsh about my kids. We just wanted a few days to be able to celebrate our anniversary and willing to hire help for it (vacation day issue). Our adopted daughter was not invited as she\u2019s also not considered family. )\n\n<clarifying info on adopted child> ***adopted child is 24 with a house and a boyfriend and a job. She did not want to go. She did not want us to fight to get her invited. We did mention it. And it also did not go well. >\n\n{me owning the AH of my AD not immediately being invited} But you know, we should have immediately agreed not to go if she wasn\u2019t invited. That is super wrong of us. I own that. Even if my niece/daughter says it didn\u2019t hurt her feelings. I imagine it did. And that\u2019s so wrong of us. I feel like a $h1t for not adding it sooner but it\u2019s just always been how they have treated her. MIL didn\u2019t want us to raise her or adopt her. She needed us to fight for her and we didn\u2019t. Shame on us. }\n\nThrow away account\n\nMy (36M) husband and I (34F) were gifted a trip last Christmas by my in laws. We are the only non retired or non-teachers in the family, so our ability to take two week vacations is a no go. \n\nIn-laws decided to book the trip the week before our anniversary and included Father\u2019s Day as they anticipated us all driving and caravanning together. We decided to fly instead. That choice displeased them as they needed to help transport some of our things since we have two children (3.5M and 1F). \n\nLeading up to the trip husband and I became concerned with using an entire week of vacation (of which we do not have much) to spend a week in Florida watching kids 24/7. We asked to bring our nanny (yes, we are privileged and we acknowledge that). We offered to pay for her flights, food, and money for either a larger place to stay; stay in our own place; or money to supplement the fact she would be there. \n\nWe were told no four times. No matter what accommodations or compromises we tried to make, we were told no. Family only. Even though for us our nanny is family. \n\nWe asked for a sit down meeting to discuss some of our concerns prior to the trip. \n\nAt meeting, we were told we were manifesting problems that did not exist and we were going to make them happen. We were told they planned on taking the kids every second of the day if we wanted and it would be totally relaxing for us and nanny isn\u2019t family and not allowed to go. \n\nThe trip went exactly as expected. We were up at 6 and each one of us had one kid pretty much the whole day. My in-laws mainly took our niece (1F) or MIL was relaxing at the beach. It was beautiful to see our kids happy but it was not relaxing. My son asked why my MIL always had the baby (niece) and where was nanny?\n\nMy husband said we were going to hire a babysitter while there and his parents demanded a conversation outside. When pictures didn\u2019t go as planned because they insisted on a time after my daughters bedtime (so she flipped out), that was also our fault. \n\nOne week before his birthday, they demanded we go to their house on Sunday afternoon to talk. Refused to tell us why. My husband tried to get an answer which led to him asking if it was a lecture. The response was yes because we were acting as teenagers. My husband said he was too stressed (tornado damage, issues at work, having two toddlers) and not interested in being treated as a child. FIL insisted on scheduling the convo anyway. Husband hung up and did tell them to fuck off if that\u2019s how they were going to act. \n\nSince then, my MIL is posting nonstop about us being narcissists and thinking life is all about us. They didn\u2019t wish him a happy birthday. He asked for a break if this was how they were going to treat him, but he didn\u2019t ask to be treated like he didn\u2019t exists. \n\nSo are the the assholes?

Parents deserve time off, and if his family isn't willing to let you bring a nanny OR help with the kids, then you aren't cutting them off, you just don't like that as a vacation.

They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\n\nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. \n\n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something! \n\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched.

You have one sentence in your post about how beautiful it was to see them enjoy the beach, but then immediately complain about how it \u2018wasn\u2019t relaxing\u2019 \u2014lady this is a family vacation, not a couples getaway. It\u2019s about your children, not your ability to chill on the beach as other people watch your kids. \n\nMeanwhile, you manage to complain about having to spend a week caring for your children without professional assistance multiple times, and detail your repeated attempts to have a nanny or babysitter come on vacation with you. It\u2019s pretty clear where your concerns lie. You seem to place basically no value on spending quality time with your kids \n\nAre you certain that your own children aren\u2019t being raised by two narcissists as well? \n\nI certainly don\u2019t know any parents of toddlers who think they need \u2018a few days\u2019 to celebrate their anniversary without having to look after their kids, most parents of young children are lucky to get an entire uninterrupted dinner date for their anniversary.", "I'm glad you're working on it", "Yes we do. With my husband we make sure that we both get some time to rest everyday without kids interrupting. When we are alone we get way more rest than when his family is there (they like to offer gifts when we are putting our kids to sleep... Or they would say they manage bed time but we find them sleeping next to our 4yo wide awake and crying...). It's ok to say that you need rest and that you won't be available. Even if they say that they will make themselves small and help.. we know they won't.", "Yeah. My husband didn\u2019t want to and I\u2019ll be honest I was upset with him but as a pathological people pleaser myself, I understood.", "Asked for the best way to try and back out or set boundaries without causing a big fight. It was one anyway which was her point after we tried. But we wanted to try and back out or make boundaries.", "One bother and his wife plus daughter. They wanted us to bring nanny because we said we would pay extra for nanny to watch their daughter too. They encouraged us to ask a third time about nanny coming. And they each drove separately. Our stuff was in an SUV with only MIL and FIL. We were also asked to bring certain things on behalf of BIL ans SIL which is also why it went with in-laws.", "Yeah I don't get it with these boomers. Like, they had the line on Christmas for their children and just think that it will never end and they'll keep owning Christmas until the day they die. Like, they are the only parents who get to plan Christmas but when their kids become parents, nope.", "No, the kids missed someone else who would also give them attention since grandma was so occupied with their cousin.", "A *family* holiday would be grandma spending time with *all* of her grandkids *equally*.  MIL didn't do that she only spent time with OP's niece.  MIL wanted \"grandma points\" with nice family pictures but didn't want to put the *effort* into spending time with all of the grandkids.  When OP's daughter cried and \"ruined\" those pictures it became OP's fault.\n\nI was raised by a nanny; my parents were still heavily involved and when we went on vacations the nanny could go to if she wanted and she got to do things she wanted to do without us.  I find your attitude towards nannies and the people who use them insulting.", "Have you ever been around an overtired little kid?  There isn't a damn thing you can do about it except put the kid to bed and let them sleep.", "Even without the anniversary trip, it's NO vacation when you're with a one year old and a 3.5 year old. People need to understand that. If you're overwhelmed and already stretched thin, vacations without help can be harder than sticking to your routine at home. Don't worry about the people who don't understand this. You can love your children and have a great time with them but still want to have time to relax.", "OP doesn\u2019t strike me as someone who often thinks about anyone but herself", "Was it betterhelp?", "Well that\u2019s kind of the consequence of your actions. You should really learn how to stop doing that.", "one of the main parts of setting a boundary is accepting that it may make the other party very angry and deciding to stick with it anyways. until you do that nothing will change with your in laws - they know they can push you around. someone being mad at you doesn\u2019t need to lead to a big fight, you can choose to disengage and not fight back.", "Thanks for replying.  I suspected the parent of the niece would have appreciated the nanny, as well.  Vacations are not easy.  Vacations with 2 babies and in-laws sounds rough.", "I wonder if parents are posting photographs/ videos/ information on them.", "Ask your mom to block her. Tell your mom that engaging with your mil is causing harm to her daughter (you) and it's her choice whether she wants to keep hurting you or not. Your mil is using your mother in attempt to triangulate you. And it really sounds like you need a new therapist.", "Maybe the in-laws are arseholes too but that does not negate the fact the whole post was a big whinge about 2 adults on a free holiday having to care for their own children.\n\nThe fact you use the word \"raised\" by your nanny is rather my point, these people wanted their nanny to come on a week long family holiday or to hire a babysitter who, given they were away, I assume they did not know, because they wanted a break from looking after their own children, who are presumably being raised full time by the nanny.\n\nI have nothing against nannies or the people who use them, but if you can't care for your own kids on holiday for a week, why do you have them.", "I have kids. I'm not saying that OP manufactured the picture drama, just that they probably did nothing else to make the vacation a pleasant experience once it wasn't to their liking. It's hard to know exactly how it all went down without being there, so I'm for sure making some assumptions. I just think this whole family sounds like a hot mess.", "The Invisible Tentacles", "Not kids that age", "This and also borderlines. Borderline personality disorder.", "Your mom needs to set a boundary with your mil that she will not listen to her daughter be bashed by anyone, for any reason, whether they are right or wrong.", "Anti depressant medication use has skyrocketed since the 50's. You know what else has? mass shootings. You'd think a more mentally healthy population would be committing less psychotic crimes, but it hasn't.", "Seemed to have triggered a lot of the psych patients in this sub lol", "Good point, added the other sub. \n\nMy mom is BPD.", "My mom would never. All children lie was her mantra kinda still is sadly. I have very strict boundaries with her. This stuff with in-laws is new and a recent revelation for us about how toxic they can be", "a therapist telling someone to ignore those boundaries and that it\u2019s too late to say no isn\u2019t the same as a therapist that tries to help work through issues in a healthy way. this person is not great at their job and it only took 1 sentence to see that. phd doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re capable of something, it just means you had the money, time and/or put the effort in to finish school. and 9 of those 10 people are doing it solely for the money-making careers.", "Gotcha.,", "Hence my original question of how alone some of these folks must be in life.", "You don't have to be alone because you believe in boundaries. You just have to find people who aren't assholes."]}
