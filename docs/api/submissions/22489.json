We are the only non retired or non-teachers in the family, so our ability to take two week vacations is a no go. \n\nIn-laws decided to book the trip the week before our anniversary and included Father\u2019s Day as they anticipated us all driving and caravanning together. We decided to fly instead. That choice displeased them as they needed to help transport some of our things since we have two children (3.5M and 1F). \n\nLeading up to the trip husband and I became concerned with using an entire week of vacation (of which we do not have much) to spend a week in Florida watching kids 24/7. We asked to bring our nanny (yes, we are privileged and we acknowledge that). We offered to pay for her flights, food, and money for either a larger place to stay; stay in our own place; or money to supplement the fact she would be there. \n\nWe were told no four times. No matter what accommodations or compromises we tried to make, we were told no. Family only. Even though for us our nanny is family. \n\nWe asked for a sit down meeting to discuss some of our concerns prior to the trip. \n\nAt meeting, we were told we were manifesting problems that did not exist and we were going to make them happen. We were told they planned on taking the kids every second of the day if we wanted and it would be totally relaxing for us and nanny isn\u2019t family and not allowed to go. \n\nThe trip went exactly as expected. We were up at 6 and each one of us had one kid pretty much the whole day. My in-laws mainly took our niece (1F) or MIL was relaxing at the beach. It was beautiful to see our kids happy but it was not relaxing. My son asked why my MIL always had the baby (niece) and where was nanny?\n\nMy husband said we were going to hire a babysitter while there and his parents demanded a conversation outside. When pictures didn\u2019t go as planned because they insisted on a time after my daughters bedtime (so she flipped out), that was also our fault. \n\nOne week before his birthday, they demanded we go to their house on Sunday afternoon to talk. Refused to tell us why. My husband tried to get an answer which led to him asking if it was a lecture. The response was yes because we were acting as teenagers. My husband said he was too stressed (tornado damage, issues at work, having two toddlers) and not interested in being treated as a child. FIL insisted on scheduling the convo anyway. Husband hung up and did tell them to fuck off if that\u2019s how they were going to act. \n\nSince then, my MIL is posting nonstop about us being narcissists and thinking life is all about us. They didn\u2019t wish him a happy birthday. He asked for a break if this was how they were going to treat him, but he didn\u2019t ask to be treated like he didn\u2019t exists. \n\nSo are the the assholes?

That choice displeased them as they needed to help transport some of our things since we have two children (3.5M and 1F).\"  \n\n\nI mean - you decided to fly and just use them as a moving company to haul stuff for your children?  If money isn't an issue (i.e. bringing the nanny) then you can pay for the extra luggage fees.)  Honestly - it would start me off on the wrong foot if the response I got was \"we'll fly instead but can you take haul X Y and Z for us thanks.\"", "ESH...Why take family vacations when it's clear NONE of you take a pleasure in actually being with family.", "NTA, mostly. You should have simply declined the trip if you couldn't bring your nanny or hire a sitter while there. Caring for young children while traveling is exhausting, and with limited time off for vacations, you need to be extremely selective in when & where you go.", "NTA", "NTA I don't think MIL knows what a narcissist is.  But she should study controlling behaviors IMO.  You should too.  Especially how to deal with a controlling person.", "ESH. The whole lot of you sound like nightmares honestly. You were given a generous gift and treated it like a burden and made demands that they transport your stuff and allow you to bring an unwanted guest because you didn\u2019t want to deal with your own kids. They made promises they couldn\u2019t keep when they probably should have just uninvited you when it became clear you didn\u2019t want to come. You all need to learn to talk like adults and compromise. And manage a week parenting your own kids without having a meltdown about it.", "ESH. \n\nThey offered you a family vacation and asked that it just be family, which is a reasonable request, especially since they are paying. Parenting your own children for a week is also not too much to ask. Most families do not have the ability to bring a nanny along. It sounds like you wanted a couples vacation, not a family vacation. You should\u2019ve declined the invitation in the beginning if you wanted it to be about relaxing with your spouse and not spending time as a family. \n\nTheir plan to deal with the issue was juvenile and inappropriate when working out a disagreement with other adults. They also shouldn\u2019t be posting about it on social media.\n\nYou all need to grow up and be more thankful for what you have.", "\"Since then, my MIL is posting nonstop about us being narcissists and thinking life is all about us.\"\n\nThey are the narcissists if this post is true and real.
