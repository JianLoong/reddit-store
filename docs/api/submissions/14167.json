Although, I'd use the term \"mutual friend\" loosely since Brandon is only \"friends\" with Jordan because their moms are best friends and Brandon feels obligated to invite him to stuff. I've asked Brandon how he feels about Jordan. They basically grew up together, so, in a way, he is considered family. \n\nJordan, in the past, has made some passive remarks. But, I didn't think much of it. Brandon had mentioned that Jordan is a chill guy, but tends to be very socially awkward and says stuff that could come off as offensive.\n\nBrandon had a little party at his place for Wrestlemania this past weekend.\n\nIt was pretty fun. We were all having a good time and were having conversations about movies. One of them was how unfair Henry Cavill has been treated and that he was perfect as Superman. Another was how both Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie are great as Captain America.\n\nOnce Wrestlemania started, things then started to shift.\n\nJordan looked at the female wrestlers and remarked how \"sad\" it was that they allowed their bodies to look like that, and that women have no excuse to not be built like Victoria's Secret models since their diets and workouts are available online on YouTube.\n\nJordan went even further to say that since women don't look like Margot Robbie or Megan Fox, women must work twice as hard to look good. \n\nBrandon actually stopped him and said that he shouldn't say stuff like that. Jordan just shrugged. He stopped a little bit, but would make small comments about how the women wrestlers were buff.\n\nLater on, we ended up talking about Chris Evans and Henry Cavill again. Jordan talked about how they were perfect. Without thinking about it, I go, \"Yeah, so why don't you look like them?\"\n\nJordan was taken aback and speechless. He started to spew stuff out like how he wasn't as tall as them nor was his body built like them. I told him that's exactly why all women can't look like Victoria's Secret models.\n\nAfter that, he was quiet for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day, I got a text from Brandon saying that, while he agrees with me, he says that next time I should just let him handle Jordan. Jordan says the wrong stuff and is offensive without meaning to be.\n\nWhile I do agree that nobody should be compared to anyone, I felt like Jordan needed to have a taste of his own medicine.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680816224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dyin6/aita_for_asking_a_guy_why_he_doesnt_look_like/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't even say anything offensive (unlike him). You just pointed out the hole in his hypocritical logic.\n\nJordan is TA for obvious reasons.

Jordan won\u2019t have Brandon around to \u201chandle\u201d him all the time, and it\u2019s helpful for him to get the kind of calling-out you gave.

He sounds like he's got a lot of maturing to do.\n\nAs for Brandon, it sounds like he's conditioned himself to apologize for Jordan's bad behavior over the years. He seriously needs to re-evaluate that friendship.", "NTA but these people are sexist. You should be silent and listen to harassment so someone else does not feel bad? Why are you less important than they are? \n\nThe thing is the group is used to enabling this guy. You didn't and they're not sure how that works. Set and keep the boundary that you will not enable his disgusting behavior and if he can't handle it he should be told it's unacceptable.\n\nI am an autistic adult and know silence is complicit behavior and enabling bad.

Walking past a VS in the mall \"Why don't you look like them?\" (well ...cause I'm 5'5\" and built like a German pig farmer...did he think I was going to change after he married me??? this wasn;t the first time he had said something like that) So walking past A&F with those glorious half nekkid men posters....I go up and stand in front of posters, he comes and stands next to me \"What's Up?\" I sigh loudly and then Say \"Woof! Look at the abs on these men. Hot!\" and then turning to look at him \"Why can't you have abs and look like that? I'd love to take one of those home.\" Blew a kiss at the poster and walked off.  Later at home he was like \"That hurt my feelings...\" I Said \"Now you know how I feel\", and left the room.", "NTA. That was a perfect rebuttal.", "NTA  Why does only Jordon get to say shit?", "NTA OP, I really hate when others side with the person who deserves karma in my opinion.
