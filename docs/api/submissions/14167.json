Although, I'd use the term \"mutual friend\" loosely since Brandon is only \"friends\" with Jordan because their moms are best friends and Brandon feels obligated to invite him to stuff. I've asked Brandon how he feels about Jordan. They basically grew up together, so, in a way, he is considered family. \n\nJordan, in the past, has made some passive remarks. But, I didn't think much of it. Brandon had mentioned that Jordan is a chill guy, but tends to be very socially awkward and says stuff that could come off as offensive.\n\nBrandon had a little party at his place for Wrestlemania this past weekend.\n\nIt was pretty fun. We were all having a good time and were having conversations about movies. One of them was how unfair Henry Cavill has been treated and that he was perfect as Superman. Another was how both Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie are great as Captain America.\n\nOnce Wrestlemania started, things then started to shift.\n\nJordan looked at the female wrestlers and remarked how \"sad\" it was that they allowed their bodies to look like that, and that women have no excuse to not be built like Victoria's Secret models since their diets and workouts are available online on YouTube.\n\nJordan went even further to say that since women don't look like Margot Robbie or Megan Fox, women must work twice as hard to look good. \n\nBrandon actually stopped him and said that he shouldn't say stuff like that. Jordan just shrugged. He stopped a little bit, but would make small comments about how the women wrestlers were buff.\n\nLater on, we ended up talking about Chris Evans and Henry Cavill again. Jordan talked about how they were perfect. Without thinking about it, I go, \"Yeah, so why don't you look like them?\"\n\nJordan was taken aback and speechless. He started to spew stuff out like how he wasn't as tall as them nor was his body built like them. I told him that's exactly why all women can't look like Victoria's Secret models.\n\nAfter that, he was quiet for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day, I got a text from Brandon saying that, while he agrees with me, he says that next time I should just let him handle Jordan. Jordan says the wrong stuff and is offensive without meaning to be.\n\nWhile I do agree that nobody should be compared to anyone, I felt like Jordan needed to have a taste of his own medicine.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680816224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dyin6/aita_for_asking_a_guy_why_he_doesnt_look_like/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look at the abs on these men. Hot!\" and then turning to look at him \"Why can't you have abs and look like that? I'd love to take one of those home.\" Blew a kiss at the poster and walked off.  Later at home he was like \"That hurt my feelings...\" I Said \"Now you know how I feel\", and left the room.", "NTA.

Not everyone is confident, knowledgeable or well-spoken enough to feel comfortable making a confrontation like that in a group setting. Honestly, Brandon saying anything at all is better than half of what I see from people in real life."]}
