We've been having fun sightseeing but we don't speak the local language and finding info online in english has been hard. My fianc\u00e9 has been wanting to go on a river cruise, but the boat schedule apparently changes when it's no longer tourist season AKA the summer, and we have no idea what the new schedule is since google still shows the old hours and whenever we call to ask, nobody answers. \n\nYesterday on the train back to our hotel we spotted a woman who was wearing a t-shirt with the boating company's logo on it, so I decided to just go up and ask her the questions we wanted answered. She spoke very fluent english and said yes when we asked her if she was an employee, but was very short and borderline rude when answering us. I left to go back to my seat afterwards, but then realized I didn't ask her a very important question about if pets were allowed, since we had our dog with us, but when I went to speak to her again she got up and changed seats without answering me. My fianc\u00e9 and I were honestly very surprised.  \n\n\nWhen I told my sister the story of what happened, she called me an AH for \"occupying that poor woman's time\", which I don't even think is true because we spoke to her for like 10 minutes not even!! My sister's gf even intervened in the call to say that I'm a nightmare, jokingly. I'm very confused, because where I'm from you don't treat customers like that and as long as you are wearing the company's uniform then you are representing the company. My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me and says that when he used to work at a fast food chain in his teens and he had the uniform on, people would sometimes ask him questions and he wouldn't mind.

She has been probably been answering those questions all day at WORK, and trying to get some peace in before she gets home, where perhaps she has a child or other obligations. \n\u201cWe only spoke to her for 10 minutes!\u201d\nYou sound ridiculously entitled and dense.", "YTA.

You weren't a customer, you were both commuters on a train. She probably wanted to unwind from her day, but you wanted to be entitled to her time, making her day longer AND without pay. She was generous by even giving you ten minutes.\n\nFYI, even in the US it wouldn't be considered polite to harass someone on their commute for information, JUST because they're dressed for their job.

This woman was off duty, not on the job, you put her on the spot, and then *went back to bother her again*, and you're surprised she ignored you?  \n\nWhere you're from has ZERO to do with where you were.  If you don't understand that not everywhere is like where you're from,  then you should *stay* where you're from.", "YTA for interrupting someone with work during their off time. \n\nThis is more of a negligent TA than a deliberate TA, but even so, you should respect a person's private time, even if they are wearing a work uniform.", "YTA.

She's allowed off time and to not be bothered by randos when she's not at work. \n\nI think it might have been okay if you kindly approached her to *ask* if you could ask her some questions since you haven't been able to find answers on your own. Then she could have agreed to or declined the interaction. If she did say no, you would also have to politely accept that. \n\nYou were inconsiderate and when called on it are being defensive and are not open to learning why you might have been wrong. \n\nAnd the only obligation you have to a company while wearing their logo is to not misrepresent the organization or damage their reputation. You are not obligated to provide customer service or do any other work while not being paid. If your company does expect that of you, they're wrong and you should not wear their branded merch/uniform when not working.", "YTA. She wasn't working, you should have just let her be. \n\nDid you really try everything in your power to get your answers? Did you call the company?", "So you think if someone doesn't change out of work clothes they are still on the job?  Weird take dude and YTA", "There is absolutely no question for a fast food worker, that takes 10 min. YTA.", "If you had seen her in a restaurant eating dinner with family while still wearing her uniform, would you have interrupted her to ask questions? Of course not. Someone wearing a uniform while obviously not working is not representing the company in their spare time.", "YTA\n\nYou were making her work without getting paid.  I understand you're frustration, but it's rude to ask employees work questions when they're not on the clock.", "YTA - she was OFF THE CLOCK. She wasn't working at her job. She was on her way home from work and you decided that you could annoy her just because she was wearing her uniform home. She owed you nothing and no, she wasn't representing the company at that point. \n\nMy dd used to work retail. She and her other co-workers always had to put a jacket on to hide their uniform shirt so that they could even make it to their cars without getting accosted by people like you.\n\nHave some respect!", "YTA. \n\nOnce you realized she wasn't that interested in answering questions, you should have left her alone. \n\nAnd no, just because she has the company shirt on doesn't mean she represents the company. You do realize that people have to get to and from work right? They typically do not get paid for that time and often wear their work uniform because they get dressed for work and then get on transportation. \n\nAnd you also weren't a customer - she wasn't on the clock, you hadn't paid for anything, and you weren't even at the place of business. \n\nYour absolute entitlement and inability to even see how you taking up 10 minutes of someone's time might be annoying is why your sister's girlfriend called you a nightmare, and it wasn't a joke.", "YTA. She was not on the clock, and you were not her customer. You both were commuting on the train. She doesn't have to answer your questions until she is at work.", "YTA. Lady ain't gettin' paid.\n\nI understand where you come from, I work in bike shops part time and love talking to people about sizing, models that fit their desired use, all of it. But that's cause I want to, not cause I should.", "YTA\n\nI'm betting you're from the US because we seem to be the English speaking nation most indoctrinated to believe that  offering free labor to our employers is a virtue. \n\nThe woman wasn't at work. You demanded her time and energy even when it was obvious that she wasn't up for playing brand ambassador. \n\nYou weren't a customer,  by the way,  because you were on a train and,  again,  *she wasn't at work*.\n\nIt's things like this that make people loathe tourists.", "YTA. Wow the entitlement. How would you like it after a long day at work when you're trying to decompress on the ride home some rando started peppering you with a bunch of stupid questions about your job?\n\nShe's off the clock and you're harassing her for info that you could have at minimum googled or asked about at your hotel. instead, you barraged her with questions for 10 minutes and on top of it tried to go back again for round two, and you're mystified as to why she ignored you and moved seats.", "YTA. She's off work. Leave her alone.", "YTA \"You're not at work and I'm not your boss, but how about you work for me for free?\"", "NTA. Completely normal to ask her like you did. Also, are you in Eastern Europe? If yes, don\u2019t take her \u201crudeness\u201d personally \u2014 lots of people are just short and come across as rude compared to Americans. Just keep asking. Also, ask your hotel to assist with planning", "NTA. Unfortunately, it\u2019s now become an issue to ask simple questions. One thing I\u2019ve learned as an American ( I\u2019m assuming that you are). Many people in other countries HATE their jobs and only do it for their \u201c holidays\u201d. Plus, almost ALL of them HATE Americans and think they\u2019re above you. Signs,policies, etc\u2026are subject to change and you, stupid Americans, have to suck it up. You are stoopit because you can\u2019t \u201c figure it out\u201d. \nWhile there are things that I loved about traveling, I did not love how I was treated in non English speaking countries.
