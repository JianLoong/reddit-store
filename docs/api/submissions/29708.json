She spoke very fluent english and said yes when we asked her if she was an employee, but was very short and borderline rude when answering us. I left to go back to my seat afterwards, but then realized I didn't ask her a very important question about if pets were allowed, since we had our dog with us, but when I went to speak to her again she got up and changed seats without answering me. My fianc\u00e9 and I were honestly very surprised.  \n\n\nWhen I told my sister the story of what happened, she called me an AH for \"occupying that poor woman's time\", which I don't even think is true because we spoke to her for like 10 minutes not even!! My sister's gf even intervened in the call to say that I'm a nightmare, jokingly. I'm very confused, because where I'm from you don't treat customers like that and as long as you are wearing the company's uniform then you are representing the company.

Fuck off and leave people alone to live their life. She's not working.", "Ohhhh YTA. You feel so entitled to this woman\u2019s time? She\u2019s not your personal concierge. At her place of work, actually, maybe she is! But you volunteered her personal time to be taken with your needs. And I could forgive a quick \u201cwow we\u2019re so excited to go to your place of work! Is it possible to call and chat with someone at said place about some questions? Thank you for your time!\u201d But you do indeed sound like a nightmare. There is truth in jokes - your sister\u2019s girlfriend is definitely seeing this side to you. \n\nYTA, again, for the sheer entitlement to this woman\u2019s time. Also for the audacity to call HER rude when you took TEN MINUTES without honoring the social cues she was giving you and then still WENT BACK AGAIN. So rude of you to call her rude.", "YTA, not all cultures are the same. Some cultures value the separation between work and personal life. You were intruding on a stranger during their personal time. Do better, it's not all about your boat trip.", "Did you not realize google works in other countries? And most sites will have an option to translate it to English?", "And JUST 10 minutes. Like look on the clock and watch how long ten minutes ard. So long he was annoying her with question in her free time. Just because she still wore her shirt from work.I just waited for the \"i want to complain to her boss for her rudeness!\".\n\nYTA\n\nI hated when i worked in retail and just needed to shop a few things after work and customers still asked me about stuff. And it wasn't that i was wearing working clothes, no, they just knew my face since i was there nearly every day. Like who see someone private and ask them to do their work? The same behaviour did OP. It was clear she wasn't working and still he occupied ten fucking minutes of her time. And it would have been more if she didn't walked away.", "Also, 10 minutes? That's more than a couple of quick questions.", "Absolutely. Pestering this poor woman after work trying to get information that you could call the company for or might even be on their website. YTA.", "Chances of Boat Company Lady posting in r/EntitledPeople in a few hours?", "That poor woman. She was off the clock. Her having her uniform on does not give people permission to ask her questions.  If she was happy to answer questions, cool. But it was clear that she wasn't (\"she was very short and borderline rude when answering us\"), yet OP persisted. \n\nFunny how OP accused the woman of being \"borderline rude\" when OP was being outright rude. \n\nYTA", "Bothering anyone you don\u2019t know on transit is a faux pas anywhere", "Yes, but OP's fiance thought it was fine when people did it to him when he wore his place of employment's uniform while he was off duty many years ago, so obviously it is okay in all situations and towards all employees of all companies world-wide all the time.", "Yeah... second this. Just because she's still wearing her work uniform and may technically be a representative of the business doesn't mean you are entitled to her time when she's CLEARLY off the clock. She's just riding the train home, trying to unwind. She's not in work mode anymore and it's honestly weird to not pick up on her desire for space.", "It sounds like they could have stood to do a little more research on events they wanted to experience on their trip beforehand, and maybe learn some of the basic tenets of the language? English is not the be-all and end-all of the world's languages.", "And it seems OP did not say \"sorry to bother you but I really failed to get those Information from the Internet, and do you mind if I ask  OK to ask you some questions in your free time?\" or anything at all to give this woman a chance to say \"no\". \n\nI admitt that I would have tried, too, to get those informations from someone who wears a companies shirt. You never know if maybe you have just met someone who loves to share those informations in order to have a new customer the other day. Bit you have to watch closely if someone is enthusiastic about it or just forgot to get rid of his working clothes in time. In the last case, just leave them alone.", "I'm also pretty sure it's not ok either to bother off the clock workers wherever she's from, but she has that \"the customer is always right\" mentality in which workers get to be abused by insensitive customers.", "Yep this is the most American thing I've ever read. Esp the part about \"representing the company\" when you're off the clock and not being paid. She was nice enough to give 10 minutes of her precious free time in the first place and OP probably ruined her day by being so entitled to it", "i honestly refuse to believe anyone actually asks a fast food employee serious questions outside of the work environment", "Yo, I take my uniform off when I'm just going to the restroom cuz I've had customers stop me and ask for help as I'm halfway through the restroom door.", "I really need OP to tell us what country this is because everyone is assuming America but that's rude as well, even in America it's not culturally appropriate to bother someone like this.", "That would have been funny as well, I would start giving OP BS answers if they assumed I worked someone because of a logo on my shirt.", "An off the clock employee not even in her place of work.", "I am from Texas, a place internationally known for our *overt* friendliness, and this had my jaw hanging. The absolute audacity.", "The person was not on the clock. Wearing a uniform does not mean you\u2019re expected to work when youre not in your place of employment. If basic customer service is standard, which BTW, OP wasn\u2019t even a customer, then why didn\u2019t OP offer to pay her for her time?", "It\u2019s not customer service. They harassed a stranger in their off time because google is hard.", "I was also wondering this!", "You misspelled 10 minutes", "Everyone\u2019s time is worth something. OP expected such service why does not offering to pay her not make her an AH?", "The OP is TA, the person wasn\u2019t on the clock and wasn\u2019t getting paid to work for those ten minutes. Also, your entitlement to other people\u2019s time is why people hate Americans. I\u2019m American and have traveled abroad numerous times and have never been treated poorly, my guess is it\u2019s how you\u2019re treating them first. YTA too.", "Also: google translate when there\u2019s no English info online", "I tend to join the local sub Reddit and ask. That way people have a choice to help me or not.", "Or google", "Anyone I had to deal with for longer than 2 minutes was usually an arsehole when I worked customer service.", "These people wanted answers to two questions, and somehow stretched that into ten whole minutes *while forgetting to ask for 50% of the information desired*. How? Not that they should have approached her off the clock anyway, but since they felt entitled to they at least could have kept it under a minute. \u201cWhat are your current hours, and do you allow dogs?\u201d \u201cMon, Wed, Fri: 9am-5pm. No, we don\u2019t.\u201d Boom. Done. But way before deciding to bother an employee on their commute, I think it would have occurred to me to call the company directly.", "Amd when you work retail it's like you get an aura of \"ask me for help\" no matter where you are. I was in a tank top, pajama pants and flip flops and a lady asked if I was working and could help her.", "If I was that lady I might have conveniently forgotten how to speak English after the first question or two. OP and their fiance's behavior is the sort that gives American (or other English speaking) tourists a bad reputation.", "Yeaahhh if theyd happened to be next to her and said \u201coh wow, thats so cool you work there! Do you happen to know hours?\u201d And then thanked her profusely and never spoke to her again itd be a NAH situation but this dude felt entitled to an astonishing amount of her time and energy. Asking one quick question is a rude-adjacent favor that demands a big thank you. 10 min of questions and then going back for more is forcing her to work for free", "Given their information about trying to contact the company\u2026I\u2019d say that the most they should have POLITELY asked this lady is \u201cwhat would be the best way for us contact \u2018Company\u2019 with questions about their hours and policies? Thank you! Have a great evening.\u201d", "Also possibly illegal. In many countries, forcing an employee to work when they're not clocked in is wage theft. When I worked at Disney, I often had people stop me on my way to my shift because they saw my uniform and name tag. I ALWAYS had to politely direct them to someone on the clock, and if for some reason I was forced to talk or work that would need to be reported to management for compensation. What OP did was steal this poor worker's time.   \n\n\n\"Representing\" the company with your work uniform doesn't mean working all the time, it means maintaining polite behavior and not acting stupid until you're in your regular clothes again.", "And like how many questions could someone ask a McDonalds worker outsode of a McDs?", "When I was 18 and working at Barnes and Noble, I was specifically instructed to not interact with customers if I wasn't clocked in. The most I was allowed to do was to point them to the information desk. Even if I was running late and supposed to be on the clock. A responsible manager knows it's wage theft, but OP's husband probably doesn't know or care about that.", "Ive seen youtube videos where people will talk on a Japanese train and the people around them don't say anything but give them a look that gives me fourth degree shame just watching it", "Same here in Copenhagen. This situation would be seen as wildly odd at best, but mostly just obnoxious and rude.", "Yes, it does seem like she has that mentality.", "Oh, I agree.  It's people like her that got us labelled \"Ugly Americans\".  My husband is Japanese, we live between both countries, and I've had second hand embarrasment at some of the things I've seen and heard from my fellow Americans in Japan.", "Yes, I was thinking \"OP *must*  be American.\" The sort that can never keep their mouth shut and think they have a right to engage people in conversation in all circumstances.", "Ugh this makes me so sad, I'm sure you're right, OP is probably American and she's absolutely wrong. It is NOT okay to bother people off the clock in the US, it is NOT socially acceptable, but it's not terribly uncommon because our society allows for employees to be punished for existing against the company line. \n\nBest compliment I've ever received was when my husband and I went to Canada and our server at a very busy restaurant in Whistler said she didn't think we were American.", "I used to get\u2026 \u201cDo you all pee in the milkshakes?\u201d.
