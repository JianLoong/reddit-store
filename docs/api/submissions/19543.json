She was the love of my life, we were high school sweethearts and got married while we were in college. She loved weddings and had planned her's since she was a little kid, so for our wedding she got a custom made dress, very beautiful. I keep the dress in a hanger in my closet to keep her close in some way. Our kids love the dress too, because if the emotional value it has.  We have some photos of our wedding day hanged in our house. \n\nAnna has always loved the dress and has said since she was young that she wanted a dress just like that one for her own wedding, which I thought was sweet. Her fiance and her got engaged two months ago and they're planning their wedding. \n\nWell the issue is that Anna asked me to borrow my wife's dress and some other stuff (like the veil and some jewelry) for the wedding. I said she can wear the jewelry as long as she gives it back, but she can't use the dress or the veil. The thing is, my wife was on the chubby side, while Anna is very skinny, so she would have to modify the dress in order to fit her. I told her she can take some photos and get a custom made dress that's like her mom's, but there's absolutely no way I'll let her borrow and ruin the dress. She got very upset and told me I can't \"gatekeep\" my wife's memory since she's their mom too. we argued and she left. \n\nNow my family is against me, they think I should let her borrow the dress, some of my wife's family agree too since they said they'd like to see Anna wearing the dress. However some of my wife's family (like my MIL) agree with me that the dress will never be the dame if Anna wears it, it'll be Anna's dress and not my wife's.", "created_utc": 1686494669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146vpsg/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_use_my_wifes/", "score": 861, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason being is that you want to keep the dress the same in honor of your wife. Your daughter also seems to want to wear the dress and honor her mom.

With that being said, I would sit down with your daughter and have a talk with her", "INFO: What do you think your wife would want?", "NTA.\n\nI agree with you and your MIL on this. That was a custom dress made for yours and your wifes big day.\n\nId hardily go to the lengths of calling it \"gate keeping\" since you're not. You have given her the option of having a similar one made and that she can wear the jewelry (borrowed).\n\nIf feels more like the fam are more focused on the dress and memories of your wife - which by the way your daughter would then be on some pedastal of comparison.\n\nMy partner knows id be down for smart casual when we get married hell casual would not be out the picture at all because comfort.\n\nI think you offering that she can take pictures to have similar is a great idea. She can keep some similarity to mom while being herself.\n\nI'd be interested in the opinions of your other kids as well - after all, it would be then unfair to let 1 kid use/amend the dress if the others couldn't (since some alterations can't be easily fixed).", "INFO: Why not let her wearher mother's veil?

If the wedding dress is one of the few things you've kept to feel close to your belated wife, I get not feeling ready to let it go.  It'd be awesome if you would let your daughter wear it with the necessary fit alterations.  Maybe compromise to letting her borrow the veil as long as alterations aren't made.", "\u2026idk it sounds like the dress is getting use. It\u2019s a regular visual reminder of the love of your life. That seems like a good and important use. I think it\u2019s valid for your daughter to ask and be upset when you say no, and just as valid for you to say no.

Imma vote with NAH.", "YTA\n\nBut not because of the dress.\n\nIt's understandable and so sweet that she'd like to wear her mom's dress. \n\nBut it's equally understandable that you don't want it altered, and there's no way for your daughter to wear it without alterations.\n\nThose two things are a wash for me; you both have very valid reasons. \n\nWhat tips it for me is your refusal to let her wear the jewelry AND veil. \n\nYour daughter wouldn't need to alter the veil, and it would probably mean the world to your daughter (perhaps even both!) to get to wear her/their mom's veil. \n\nIt's a good compromise, but for some reason, you won't allow it. That tells me that you aren't reacting logically, just emotionally. And while this is definitely an emotional issue, it's an emotional issue for your daughter, too.

She loves/cherishes her mother as much as you do. She was your wife, but also she was her mother. You are keeping her mother from her. Instead of keeping the dress (and her mother's memories) from her, you should be proud that she wants to wear the dress and allow her to honor her mother in that manner, and you should honor that with her.\n\nThat being said, this is most likely the way that she feels that her mother is part of her wedding since her mother cannot be there in person. By keeping that dress from her, you are most likely diminishing what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life.\n\nThis wedding is supposed to be about your daughter, not about you and what you want. This is something within your means that you have the power to give her, it's not out of budget or anything of that nature. So by keeping the dress from her blatantly, you are basically keeping her own mother from her. \n\nGive her the dress to keep for her own happy memories of her mother and hope that one day she can pass it down to her own daughter.", "YTA - just ask yourself, what would your wife have wanted? My guess is, was for her daughter to wear her dress.", "YTA\n\nI think your wife would love her own daughter to wear her wedding dress. It\u2019s very common and super common to have stuff altered.

Altering a dress to fit doesn't change the memory.", "I understand you have an attachment to the dress because you lost your wife, but she also lost her mother. Her loss is no less than yours. \n\nWhat a better way to honour your wife than by letting her daughter wear it? And so what, that it may have to be taken in to fit her? It doesn\u2019t mean the dress will be destroyed, it means it will be used and loved. Try and talk to her to see her point of view. \n\nPlus, it might not be the healthiest for your grieving to have the dress in the closet constantly reminding you of your loss.

Of course she is not and I do understand how bittersweet this would be for you. How does keeping the dress the same and hanging unused in a closet cherish your wife\u2019s memory? For a daughter to want to her mom\u2019s dress is special. Your wife was obviously a special person. Do you think she would have felt honored to have her daughter want to wear her dress? At the very least, it is not insulting to her memory for your daughter to want the dress. Please reconsider from some different perspectives. My best to you.", "YTA - I understand that you want to keep your wife\u2019s memory exactly as it was. This is such a hard decision. I think it is important to think about what your wife would have wanted. It is also important for the daughter to feel her mom at the wedding as she will not be able to be there in person. Wearing her dress sounds like the emotional support that she needs.", "YTA. What are you going to to do with it keep it hanging in a closet til the day you die? You must have so many memories of her. It would be lovely for Anna to wear it, the fact that it has to be modified doesn\u2019t make it any less your wife\u2019s dress as well.", "YTA, why the hell do you think your wife kept the dress?! What were your plans for it, be buried with it upon your death or worse?", "I may get down voted but I say NTA.\n\nWhile its sweet that she wanna wear the dress, I agree it would need to be modified if Anna is skinnier than her mom may \"ruin\" the point it was your wifes. I have \"ruin\" in marks because it does not get ruined it look, rather in size which means its not your wifes anymore. Its your daughters if that happens.\n\nBesides...reading some comments where they be like \"think what your wife would want\" and then say she may wanted that and would had loved I call a bit...bullshit.

Your wife's wedding dress holds deep sentimental value for *both* you and your daughter.

Wearing her mother's wedding dress for her own celebration is how your daughter wants to honor her late mother, and in my personal opinion, it's a great way to do just that, rather than keeping it hidden away in a closet on a hanger forever. \n\nYou should think this through a bit more and be open to seeing this situation from your daughter's point of view instead of just your own.", "Hi! I work professionally altering clothing for repeated use.\n\nA good seamstress-- and if you find one who specializes in bridal wear, they're gonna be *good*-- will be able to alter the dress in order to fit your daughter beautifully AND return it to it's original state.

If it has a seam at the waist, the skirt could be detached, made smaller with a few pleats, and a waist band sewn on. Daughter could then have a complimentary bodice made either in a new style or based on her mom's gown. When the wedding is done, you can have the original skirt and bodice reunited (or leave them as separates in case another child wants to wear the skirt and/or bodice).", "NAH because I understand your grief.

Maybe let the brides wear the veil, as is.", "NAH, but I have questions:\n\n1) What does the dress symbolize to your oldest daughter? I doubt this is really about just wanting the fabric.\n\n2) Is the dress the only item that is regularly viewed as part of their mother? Is the jewelry otherwise forgotten in the back of a drawer, and your daughter does not actively associate it with her mother? Is there another way for your daughter to feel the inclusion of her mother?\n\n3) How did your wife honor her own mother at your wedding? Did they spend days pouring over options for the wedding dress, so the dress felt like a physical manifestation of the bond between mother and daughter? Would your MIL be up for bonding with your daughter this way, especially as your daughter deals with the predatory wedding industry?\n\n4) Would your younger children be interested in creating a tradition to incorporate their mom all of their weddings? Please do not exclude your son: he lost his mom, too. What about sharing a secret recipe of hers, which could then be handed down to all of the children? Did she have a favorite poem? Would a picture of her on a reserved seat be special? \n\nI could not wear my mother's wedding dress, as she was much taller and a different shape than I am. I made my own ribbon bouquet and incorporated fake flowers from her wedding. We literally tied the knot, using ribbons that were sentimental to our families.

It all worked out.", "I don't think you are an AH and I think you are in a difficult situation. My first thought is what would your wife have wanted to be done with the dress? I can completely see your view on this as well. I am also thinking about your youngest daughter and if she also has a desire to utilize the dress. I like your idea of having a wedding dress made in the style of your wife's dress. Your daughter wants a connection to her mother of her wedding day which is understandable. I do have a question about you not letting her wear the veil. The veil should not have to be altered to wear so I am at a loss as to why you won't let it be used. As for the dress on a hanger I cringed, I would recommend getting a mannequin for it and display the dress. Your daughter's dig about you being the gatekeeper of her mother belittles your relationship with your wife. Why would she feel her desire to wear the dress outweighs your connection to your wife and an item that was at a monumentality significant moment in your relationship?", ">She got very upset and told me I can't \"gatekeep\" my wife's memory\n\nThat's a very emotional and not very rational response. Understandably. But your wedding was something special for *you and your wife* - you're allowed to have cherished memories and keepsakes of *your wife* which are separate from everyone's memories of her as their mom.\n\nIf you can't bear to see the dress altered, it's fine to say no. Your daughter is not an AH for asking but should not be pushing you on this.\n\nNTA.", "I think most women keep their wedding dress thinking maybe a future generation will want to use it or have it as a keepsake. Or just because what else do you do with a dress.  We all collect things over our lifetime knowing that we will leave them, and hope someone after us will treasure them, too.  Maybe it would be easier for OP to think about what he would want to happen with his things when he passes? \n\nIt sounds like your daughter would be amenable to only doing minimal alterations to make it fit, and not changing the look of the dress.  If the dress then went back into OPs closet, it would look essentially the same. So the issue is really that the daughter wore the dress at her wedding.  Op needs to examine why he has an issue with this. And why he has put his wife\u2019s memory in a dress? \n\nThink of it from your daughter\u2019s perspective, she grew up seeing that you put her mother\u2019s memory in her wedding dress. So for her the dress is the best way to feel her mother\u2019s presence at her wedding. And by OP saying the dress is mine, is saying that her mother and memory of her mother is OPs.  That is gatekeeping her mother.  Since OPs kids were young when their mother died, all the connection they have to their mother is through what OP shared with them.  If the wedding dress is any indication, it sounds like OP has only considered his own loss and that his wife\u2019s memory is his since he has the most actual memories of her.  There is a profound sense of emptiness for children who don\u2019t have memories from their parents, and their attachment should not be dismissed since they don\u2019t have memories. \n\nOp consider your children\u2019s loss and not just your own.", "You're not an asshole but the grief is making you seem that way. \n\nI feel like 99% of mothers would LOVE to have their daughter wear their wedding dress.\n\nSo that's the only question, would your WIFE, the original owner of the dress want your daughter to wear it.\n\nIf the answer is yes, your daughter is right and you are gatekeeping her mother's memory from her.\n\nI don't really care about everyone else's thoughts, you knew your wife best, be honest with yourself and do as she would want.\n\nCause if she would love her daughter to get the dress and you don't allow it, you will be really selfish towards your children nonetheless.\n\nThe second thing is small but rubbed me the wrong way.

Now my mom gave me permission, but this is just trying to say she also wants to have her mom close to her at her wedding day.", "NAH, but, OP, dresses are meant to be worn.  I understand your attachment to it, but what a wonderful way to have your wife/her mother included in the wedding.  Could you even consider that seeing your daughter in that gown might make you feel like a part of your wife is there?  I know it\u2019s rare, but I have seen and read things about wedding dresses that have been passed down and treasured by generations of brides.  The very thought of that, imo, would be amazing and truly keep the memory your wife alive.  I hope you all work it out, and I am very sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "NAH. \n\nI agree that both parties have reasons for why they want the future of the dress to be what they want. Both are valid.\n\nBut as someone who sews, I want to point out two concerns.\n\nFirst, depending on what fabric was used, it might not be in the best condition. Fabrics do break down over time, and bridal fabrics are often considered just for their ability to look good once. They don't always clean well, and even just left on a hanger can get really brittle. Before anyone wears this dress again, the fabric needs to be evaluated.\n\nSecond, resizing complex bridal gowns is not easy and can get very expensive. The alterations that would be needed for the eldest daughter would completely change the gown and the alterations would not be reversible. And depending on the skill of the person doing the alterations, it might not look good on the daughter or look much like the original design. The more beadwork or applique is on the gown, the more of a nightmare it would be.\n\nI think all parties would end up happier with the jewelry and veil as something borrowed/something old, and take the original dress to a skilled dress maker for it to be copied in new fabric to the daughter's proportions. The end dress will almost certainly be a better product and cost less than deconstructing and reconstructing a vintage dress. OP can be at that initial appointment and take the dress home with him once the dressmaker has what they need to copy it.", "NAH. But let me ask you this - if your wife had lived, would SHE have been willing to let Anna wear her dress, alterations and all? It would be a lovely way for Anna to include her late mother in her wedding day. Jewelry is one thing, but the wedding dress is the wedding dress. I understand if you don't want to do this and it is your decision, but is it better to treat the dress as a relic than it is to bring it, and the beautiful memories of your own wedding to a woman you so clearly adored, back into the world on a beautiful day? My only caveat there would be that, IF you allow the dress to be altered, you consider Caroline's body type as well as Anna's so that the dress not be altered in a way that Caroline could not also wear it if she chooses to do so.\n\nAnd remember - it's not a dress that keeps your wife close to you.

Would Anna wearing her dress, even if it needed altered, be something that she would have wanted?\n\nOn one hand, I can understand wanting to keep that piece as close to its original state as possible. On the other hand, I would see this as an opportunity to pass down the hope and love that this dress represents as a way of blessing a new union and carrying your wife's touch onto a new generation. I wish that Anna would have made her desires clear earlier so you'd have more time to think it over. Regardless of that, please take time to really think about it.

There are ways to take a dress in while preserving the dress for others. My understanding of the \u201calterations\u201d in question were because they were different sizes \u2014 which implies she wants to *wear her mother\u2019s dress*. Not a dress made from her mothers dress. This would preserve the dress for the other two children if they also wish to wear it. Altering dresses, especially wedding dresses, is a super common practice and a lot of seamstresses are used to these kinds of requests and will let you know where it is or isn\u2019t possible.

I think it\u2019s gross to act like his loss is greater or worse than the loss the kids experienced. Based on the story he tells us, he *is* gatekeeping the memory and doing trauma Olympics with his own kids. I think OP needs to go to grief counseling because it\u2019s hard to lose a partner and coping with grief is inherently difficult. I\u2019m not even calling OP an AH, I think this is a NAH situation, but also see how he\u2019s pushing his kids away (all three of them, even if the youngest agrees with him right now) through this choice. He\u2019s not the AH, but his daughter also wouldn\u2019t be the AH if his decision damaged their relationship for a long time. That\u2019s my opinion, and I share how similar behaviors from my family have caused rifts above. You\u2019re entitled to disagree, but I do hope that you have more to back up your opinion than is shared because, frankly, that worries me as someone who has lost a lot of people prematurely, like OP and his children, because tying loss to things can make it difficult to coexist with your grief, which is a clear underlying theme in this post, even if OP isn\u2019t fully aware of it.", "This is not your grief or you way of grieving.

The dress is from your wedding which was something solely between you and your wife. Your wedding day was an event specific to you and your wife. It was an event that was about her being your partner. Your wedding wasn't about your children it was only about you and your wife. That is your very and extremely personal event and memory for you. NTA. If you don't want the dress altered you are fine. Totally understandable. Let her wear the jewelry. If she wants to cut the veil I understand not letting her take the veil.

He can see her in it any time he wants. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t judge him for wanting to keep it, but I still don\u2019t see how what you suggested is a solution. \n\n> Having it made into other items means everyone can keep a piece of their mum/wife with them.\n\nYou mean like\u2026 having it made into a dress or part of a dress for one of them?\n\n> I didn\u2019t say he\u2019d like it, but he also doesn\u2019t like your idea of giving it to his daughter so I don\u2019t think my idea is worse.\n\nI just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a good solution if it doesn\u2019t solve the problem or give anyone in this situation what they actually want?", "I'd say destroying something to make something totally new is quite a lot worse when OP's major objection is he doesn't even want it altered.\n\nIf the biggest objection was that he couldn't share it with all his kids if it needed altering, your idea may make sense, but that's not the issue OP is having with it.", "Correct. That's the exact point I'm making.\n\nThe person I'm replying to was suggesting turning the dress into \"Bears/cushions. Four things.\", which would destroy the dress, rather than just altering it to fit his daughter for her wedding.", "How is turning a wedding dress into a cushion cover an \"alteration\"?", "The more I hear about the proposed alterations, the more I worry that this is about saving money moreso than sentiment on the daughter's part.", "[deleted]", "No, I\u2019m saying having the dress will *create* a meaningful memory of her mother being involved in the day. \n\nI get that the dress itself is a memory for dad, but he also got to be with her then, and has photos of her actually wearing it. Daughter will miss out on having her mother there in such an important day.", ">For me, the dress wasn\u2019t nearly as important as the memories of our wedding & the life and family we\u2019ve built together.\n\n*For you* it is less important. For others it is not the same. Memories fade, time passes, and having a physical object that helps to maintain those memories can be very important.", "But it is your dress. That is really different as he is keeping this reminder of his wife.", "But there are two daughters. If the older one does get to wear/alter the dress, the younger daughter won't be able to use it. I saw another post that suggested removing the train (if there is one, or something similar so the original dress stays more or less \"intact\"), and having 3 pieces of frabric made from it for all the children to equally have. I actually have a piece of my Grandmas homemade wedding dress that I would incorporate if I ever got married. I feel like that might be a fair solution, if possible.", "I know you mean well, but pressing him on what his wife may or may not have wanted isn\u2019t helpful here. This dress is special to him, especially if he\u2019s kept it physically so close all these years. It belongs to him, and it\u2019s okay for him to keep and cherish it. He has offered reasonable compromises to honor both his wife and child.\n\nETA: I like the comment further down that says he should let her borrow the veil, since it wouldn\u2019t need to be altered and can be returned intact. I think that is a wonderful compromise.", "They have two daughters though. How do you decide", "You don't know that. Why is everyone insisting on knowing what she would want just because she's a mother? For all you know, her opinion could have been \"fuck off, get your own dress\".", "She may not have though, especially if it meant that their younger daughter wouldn't have a chance to wear it either because of the extreme alterations needed.", "I know. Seriously. Memory bears?", "No she wasn't. OP is being ridiculous. All this fuss over some fabric that's sitting in a closet is crazy.", "What about his younger daughter? Should she have to see her sister wearing the dress and possibly never get a chance to wear it because of the alterations?", "I knew that she liked the dress, when she was a child she used to say would use a dress like her mom's, not her mom's dress, so I always thought she would like to wear something similar. She told me she has always dreamed about wearing this dress when she asked me to borrow it.", "There's a seamstress here who said it should be possible, if you let the seamstress working on it know what the plan is. So I think OP should consider it. I do get if he can't bear to let it go though, it sounds like he's put a lot on this dress as a coping mechanism, and as someone who also has things from loved ones who have passed that mean the world to me, I just can't judge OP if he can't let this go. I get it. It's NAH for me.", "And this is how he coping with the grief that he can't stand next to her at their oldest daughters wedding. Seeing that dress on her might remind him that she is gone. EVERYONE'S feelings have to be accounted for", "Yeah, especially since she won't have a copy made either.", "yeah, delving into the comments starting to sound like it.  \n\n\nOP needs to edit this post with all these lil details lol", "They were responding to a comment claiming to know what most mothers would want. Their response was entirely relevant.", "And mine was an example of other women\u2019s perspective", "I\u2019m aware of that. I responded to that particular comment, because someone asked what his wife might want. So I gave him a viewpoint on what I would want should I pass away before my daughter gets married. \n\nI understand why he has the emotional attachment to the dress, and I\u2019m not trying to minimise that in any way. I\u2019m just suggesting that his wife may not have had the same emotional attachment to the dress, and it may have been something she would want.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to consider whether knowing his wife\u2019s position on the topic would make his decision different. If he knew, with absolute certainty, that his wife would want his daughter to use the dress, would he still feel the same? Or would he be okay with relinquishing \u2018ownership\u2019 of the dress?", "Everyone keeps saying permanently altering the dress so the younger sister can\u2019t wear it. Has anyone thought to contact an honest to god dressmaker/seamstress and ask if the dress can be taken in WITHOUT cutting the excess fabric away? Could it be sewn down on the inside of the bodice and pleated into the skirt/train?", "Unfortunately Anna wants to cut the veil as well as she wants a shorter veil per a comment from OP", "He's the one who came to the internet asking strangers about a very personal situation, if he didn't want those kinds of comments he wouldn't make it internet stranger's business \n\nPlus this is absolutely fake like the rest of posts on here, so I'm not too concerned", "Er it\u2019s not just a piece of fabric to the OP, it\u2019s a memento of his wedding day and his wife and if it is just a piece of fabric why is the OP\u2019s daughter obsessed with it?\n\nSecondly getting the relatives involved is very rude, it\u2019s got nothing to do with them. It sounds like the daughter got the relatives involved to pile the pressure on the OP, kinda like flying monkeys.", "A custom made wedding dress is absurdly expensive. I don't think it's fair to vilify her for not wanting, or being able, to do that...", "I got down voted for my comment \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but I feel this is the simplest of solutions.", "Oh, my goodness! Is she sure she really wants her mom\u2019s dress if she wants to change so much of it? It sounds like she may like the idea and sentiment of having her mother\u2019s dress (which I totally understand), but actually prefer a different aesthetic. There must be another way to incorporate her mother in the ceremony without permanently altering her mother\u2019s things.", "It does have something to do with them. It's been 16+ years; the family should know that OP is still deep in his mourning that he won't budge. That's cause for concern about his mental health."]}
