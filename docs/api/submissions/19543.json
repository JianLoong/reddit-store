She was the love of my life, we were high school sweethearts and got married while we were in college. She loved weddings and had planned her's since she was a little kid, so for our wedding she got a custom made dress, very beautiful. I keep the dress in a hanger in my closet to keep her close in some way. Our kids love the dress too, because if the emotional value it has.  We have some photos of our wedding day hanged in our house. \n\nAnna has always loved the dress and has said since she was young that she wanted a dress just like that one for her own wedding, which I thought was sweet. Her fiance and her got engaged two months ago and they're planning their wedding. \n\nWell the issue is that Anna asked me to borrow my wife's dress and some other stuff (like the veil and some jewelry) for the wedding. I said she can wear the jewelry as long as she gives it back, but she can't use the dress or the veil. The thing is, my wife was on the chubby side, while Anna is very skinny, so she would have to modify the dress in order to fit her. I told her she can take some photos and get a custom made dress that's like her mom's, but there's absolutely no way I'll let her borrow and ruin the dress. She got very upset and told me I can't \"gatekeep\" my wife's memory since she's their mom too. we argued and she left. \n\nNow my family is against me, they think I should let her borrow the dress, some of my wife's family agree too since they said they'd like to see Anna wearing the dress. However some of my wife's family (like my MIL) agree with me that the dress will never be the dame if Anna wears it, it'll be Anna's dress and not my wife's.", "created_utc": 1686494669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146vpsg/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_use_my_wifes/", "score": 32, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To reiterate what others are saying, perhaps take time to consider what you think your wife may have wanted for the dress. \n\nNAH", "So personally, I would say NAH. The reason being is that you want to keep the dress the same in honor of your wife. Your daughter also seems to want to wear the dress and honor her mom. Also, from what I hear, most women would love for their daughters to wear their wedding dress. It would be a beautiful tradition. With that being said, I would sit down with your daughter and have a talk with her", "INFO: What do you think your wife would want?", "NTA.\n\nI agree with you and your MIL on this. That was a custom dress made for yours and your wifes big day.\n\nId hardily go to the lengths of calling it \"gate keeping\" since you're not. You have given her the option of having a similar one made and that she can wear the jewelry (borrowed).\n\nIf feels more like the fam are more focused on the dress and memories of your wife - which by the way your daughter would then be on some pedastal of comparison.\n\nMy partner knows id be down for smart casual when we get married hell casual would not be out the picture at all because comfort.\n\nI think you offering that she can take pictures to have similar is a great idea. She can keep some similarity to mom while being herself.\n\nI'd be interested in the opinions of your other kids as well - after all, it would be then unfair to let 1 kid use/amend the dress if the others couldn't (since some alterations can't be easily fixed).", "INFO: Why not let her wearher mother's veil? Also, why nor store the dress properly if you want to preserve the dress?", "NTA. Hide the dress until after the wedding.", "NAH.  If the wedding dress is one of the few things you've kept to feel close to your belated wife, I get not feeling ready to let it go.  It'd be awesome if you would let your daughter wear it with the necessary fit alterations.  Maybe compromise to letting her borrow the veil as long as alterations aren't made.", "\u2026idk it sounds like the dress is getting use. It\u2019s a regular visual reminder of the love of your life. That seems like a good and important use. I think it\u2019s valid for your daughter to ask and be upset when you say no, and just as valid for you to say no. I also think your needs and your daughter\u2019s are more important than speculations about what wife would have wanted.   Imma vote with NAH.", "YTA\n\nBut not because of the dress.\n\nIt's understandable and so sweet that she'd like to wear her mom's dress. \n\nBut it's equally understandable that you don't want it altered, and there's no way for your daughter to wear it without alterations.\n\nThose two things are a wash for me; you both have very valid reasons. \n\nWhat tips it for me is your refusal to let her wear the jewelry AND veil. \n\nYour daughter wouldn't need to alter the veil, and it would probably mean the world to your daughter (perhaps even both!) to get to wear her/their mom's veil. \n\nIt's a good compromise, but for some reason, you won't allow it. That tells me that you aren't reacting logically, just emotionally. And while this is definitely an emotional issue, it's an emotional issue for your daughter, too.

What is it actually doing than probably collecting dust somewhere. You keep referring to her as solely your wife. She\u2019s also the mother of your children.

She loves/cherishes her mother as much as you do. She was your wife, but also she was her mother. You are keeping her mother from her. Instead of keeping the dress (and her mother's memories) from her, you should be proud that she wants to wear the dress and allow her to honor her mother in that manner, and you should honor that with her.\n\nThat being said, this is most likely the way that she feels that her mother is part of her wedding since her mother cannot be there in person. By keeping that dress from her, you are most likely diminishing what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life.\n\nThis wedding is supposed to be about your daughter, not about you and what you want. This is something within your means that you have the power to give her, it's not out of budget or anything of that nature. So by keeping the dress from her blatantly, you are basically keeping her own mother from her. \n\nGive her the dress to keep for her own happy memories of her mother and hope that one day she can pass it down to her own daughter.", "YTA - just ask yourself, what would your wife have wanted? My guess is, was for her daughter to wear her dress.", "YTA\n\nI think your wife would love her own daughter to wear her wedding dress. It\u2019s very common and super common to have stuff altered.

I would be willing to bet your wife would be sad to know you would deny your daughter this. YTA.", "YTA. Wouldn't you rather have new memories with this beautiful heirloom than it just hang in the closet? Your wife would have let her have the dress, or at least the veil. Let your daughter celebrate with her mom on her special day.", "YTA   It would be a wonderful way of honoring your wife's and her mother's memory.  Altering a dress to fit doesn't change the memory.", "I understand you have an attachment to the dress because you lost your wife, but she also lost her mother. Her loss is no less than yours. \n\nWhat a better way to honour your wife than by letting her daughter wear it? And so what, that it may have to be taken in to fit her? It doesn\u2019t mean the dress will be destroyed, it means it will be used and loved. Try and talk to her to see her point of view. \n\nPlus, it might not be the healthiest for your grieving to have the dress in the closet constantly reminding you of your loss. It might be beneficial to see your daughter in a very happy day and loving memory wearing her dress. \n\nSoft YTA", "Hard to call you an A H given the situation, but I don\u2019t agree with you. Items should be used. Even if it is altered, wearing her mom\u2019s dress is a beautiful way to have your wife represented at your daughter\u2019s wedding. Almost like she is really there. Of course she is not and I do understand how bittersweet this would be for you. How does keeping the dress the same and hanging unused in a closet cherish your wife\u2019s memory? For a daughter to want to her mom\u2019s dress is special. Your wife was obviously a special person. Do you think she would have felt honored to have her daughter want to wear her dress? At the very least, it is not insulting to her memory for your daughter to want the dress. Please reconsider from some different perspectives. My best to you.", "YTA - I understand that you want to keep your wife\u2019s memory exactly as it was. This is such a hard decision. I think it is important to think about what your wife would have wanted. It is also important for the daughter to feel her mom at the wedding as she will not be able to be there in person. Wearing her dress sounds like the emotional support that she needs.", "YTA. What are you going to to do with it keep it hanging in a closet til the day you die? You must have so many memories of her. It would be lovely for Anna to wear it, the fact that it has to be modified doesn\u2019t make it any less your wife\u2019s dress as well.", "YTA, why the hell do you think your wife kept the dress?! What were your plans for it, be buried with it upon your death or worse?", "I may get down voted but I say NTA.\n\nWhile its sweet that she wanna wear the dress, I agree it would need to be modified if Anna is skinnier than her mom may \"ruin\" the point it was your wifes. I have \"ruin\" in marks because it does not get ruined it look, rather in size which means its not your wifes anymore. Its your daughters if that happens.\n\nBesides...reading some comments where they be like \"think what your wife would want\" and then say she may wanted that and would had loved I call a bit...bullshit. Maybe your Wife did wanted it or she may would had NOT.

I can understand why you would not want that. Neither would I in your position. \n\nYour daughter can be upset, her feelings matter BUT SO DO YOURS. \n\nDo not let yourself influence in all honesty, if you do not want it, its okay.", "A very soft YTA. Your wife's wedding dress holds deep sentimental value for *both* you and your daughter. Altering the dress so your daughter will be able to wear it in her own wedding would not be \"ruining\" it in the least bit, and it's a little odd that you view it in this way. \n\nYou lost your wife, but it's important for you to remember that your children lost their *mother,* and their grief/healing is no less significant than your own. Wearing her mother's wedding dress for her own celebration is how your daughter wants to honor her late mother, and in my personal opinion, it's a great way to do just that, rather than keeping it hidden away in a closet on a hanger forever. \n\nYou should think this through a bit more and be open to seeing this situation from your daughter's point of view instead of just your own.", "Hi! I work professionally altering clothing for repeated use.\n\nA good seamstress-- and if you find one who specializes in bridal wear, they're gonna be *good*-- will be able to alter the dress in order to fit your daughter beautifully AND return it to it's original state.

If it has a seam at the waist, the skirt could be detached, made smaller with a few pleats, and a waist band sewn on. Daughter could then have a complimentary bodice made either in a new style or based on her mom's gown. When the wedding is done, you can have the original skirt and bodice reunited (or leave them as separates in case another child wants to wear the skirt and/or bodice).", "NAH because I understand your grief. But I think you are making the wrong decision. \n\nAs long as Anna still keeps the integrity of the dress so it is similar to what your wife wore. I think your wife would have been delighted that her daughter wanted to wear it. \n\nYour daughter is going to be so sad that her mother isn\u2019t there to see her get married.

Your daughter is correct- this was your wife, but she was also your daughter\u2019s mom. This is an important way for your daughter to include her mother in her wedding day. \n\nAnd speaking as a woman with a daughter, if I died I would want my daughter to wear my wedding dress (if she chose to).

If one daughter can't use the dress, the other one can't either - something to keep in mind. \n\nThis is family relationship and emotional stuff. You need to have a good honest conversation on that with your daughter and then realize you both probably will not come away with any opinions changed, just a greater understanding.", "NTA.  But why not the veil?\n\nThe dress reminds you of your wedding.  I get that the daughter wants to feel close to her mom but...

Why can\u2019t your daughter remember her too? You know her mom doesn\u2019t get to go dress shopping with her. Her mom doesn\u2019t get to help plan. Her mom doesn\u2019t get to help her get ready.", "I said she can have that.", "Why would he have a copy made? All she needs is some good pictures and she can get the dress copied on her own.", "What about the veil, why can\u2019t she wear that?", "No, it wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same, but it wouldn\u2019t be ruined.  Letting her wear it on her wedding day may even make it more special, adding another layer to its memory and significance in your family.", "So what\u2019s going to happen to it when you die then? You just going to instruct your kids to build a shrine or something? \n\nIt will be the same dress. You just seem to be holding on to it like some sort of unhealthy clutch. It won\u2019t change the fact that it was her dress. They can both have it be their dress", "No, I wouldn't.", "Of course I remember my wife when I see our children, I see a lot of her in them, but they're not an object, it's different.", "Anna wants a shorter veil, so she will have to cut it, I said no to that too and she was okay with that part.", "> *\"Her mom doesn\u2019t get to help plan. Her mom doesn\u2019t get to help her get ready.\"*\n\nThis is a really important point. Wanting to wear her late mother's wedding dress might not only be Anna's way of honoring her memory, but also a way to make her feel less alone, as though her mother is there with her. She suffered a significant loss too, just as OP did, and that loss must feel especially poignant for her right now.", "No, it's hanging in the closet, it's not hidden in a box", "but yet it would be the same dress. You can\u2019t say you can\u2019t imagine anyone wearing the same dress but your wife and it have the exact design your daughter would get. \n\nWhat would your wife want OP? Why won\u2019t you answer that?", "he won\u2019t let her get a copy I assure you", "What do you think your wife would do?", "Exactly - theyre your children and youre putting a physical object above them.", "I'm a little skeptical that this wasn't your immediate initial reply. \n\nIf true, it also doesn't make sense that Anna would understand not being able to alter the veil but not understand the same limitations for the dress. \n\nWhat was her reasoning for accepting that she couldn't alter the veil but not accepting that you didn't want the dress altered?", "So you aren\u2019t even preserving it properly. Yeah that\u2019s going to do more harm to it than your daughter getting a seamstress to it.", "OP never said they wouldn't be ok with someone wearing an exact copy, just that the original is too precious to them to risk altering, and that is perfectly fair. It wouldn't be the same physical dress if a copy was made. They said this explicitly. They also said they don't know what their wife wanted but that the dress meant a lot to her.", "He does! He wrote that he asked her to take pics so she can have one like this in her measurements.", "He says in his post she can have a copy made", "I can't say for sure what she would've wanted since we never spoke about this before she passed away. I know that the dress was very important to her, she loved it, so maybe she wouldn't have liked for it to get modified.", "Considering he said he can\u2019t imagine someone else wearing the dress i wouldn\u2019t put it last op to decide last minute she can\u2019t even wear a copy"]}
