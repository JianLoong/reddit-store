She was the love of my life, we were high school sweethearts and got married while we were in college. She loved weddings and had planned her's since she was a little kid, so for our wedding she got a custom made dress, very beautiful. I keep the dress in a hanger in my closet to keep her close in some way. Our kids love the dress too, because if the emotional value it has.  We have some photos of our wedding day hanged in our house. \n\nAnna has always loved the dress and has said since she was young that she wanted a dress just like that one for her own wedding, which I thought was sweet. Her fiance and her got engaged two months ago and they're planning their wedding. \n\nWell the issue is that Anna asked me to borrow my wife's dress and some other stuff (like the veil and some jewelry) for the wedding. I said she can wear the jewelry as long as she gives it back, but she can't use the dress or the veil. The thing is, my wife was on the chubby side, while Anna is very skinny, so she would have to modify the dress in order to fit her. I told her she can take some photos and get a custom made dress that's like her mom's, but there's absolutely no way I'll let her borrow and ruin the dress. She got very upset and told me I can't \"gatekeep\" my wife's memory since she's their mom too. we argued and she left. \n\nNow my family is against me, they think I should let her borrow the dress, some of my wife's family agree too since they said they'd like to see Anna wearing the dress. However some of my wife's family (like my MIL) agree with me that the dress will never be the dame if Anna wears it, it'll be Anna's dress and not my wife's.", "created_utc": 1686494669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146vpsg/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_use_my_wifes/", "score": 4897, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason being is that you want to keep the dress the same in honor of your wife. Your daughter also seems to want to wear the dress and honor her mom.

With that being said, I would sit down with your daughter and have a talk with her", "INFO: What do you think your wife would want?", "NTA.\n\nI agree with you and your MIL on this. That was a custom dress made for yours and your wifes big day.\n\nId hardily go to the lengths of calling it \"gate keeping\" since you're not. You have given her the option of having a similar one made and that she can wear the jewelry (borrowed).\n\nIf feels more like the fam are more focused on the dress and memories of your wife - which by the way your daughter would then be on some pedastal of comparison.\n\nMy partner knows id be down for smart casual when we get married hell casual would not be out the picture at all because comfort.\n\nI think you offering that she can take pictures to have similar is a great idea. She can keep some similarity to mom while being herself.\n\nI'd be interested in the opinions of your other kids as well - after all, it would be then unfair to let 1 kid use/amend the dress if the others couldn't (since some alterations can't be easily fixed).", "INFO: Why not let her wearher mother's veil?

If the wedding dress is one of the few things you've kept to feel close to your belated wife, I get not feeling ready to let it go.  It'd be awesome if you would let your daughter wear it with the necessary fit alterations.  Maybe compromise to letting her borrow the veil as long as alterations aren't made.", "\u2026idk it sounds like the dress is getting use. It\u2019s a regular visual reminder of the love of your life. That seems like a good and important use. I think it\u2019s valid for your daughter to ask and be upset when you say no, and just as valid for you to say no.

That tells me that you aren't reacting logically, just emotionally. And while this is definitely an emotional issue, it's an emotional issue for your daughter, too.

She loves/cherishes her mother as much as you do. She was your wife, but also she was her mother. You are keeping her mother from her. Instead of keeping the dress (and her mother's memories) from her, you should be proud that she wants to wear the dress and allow her to honor her mother in that manner, and you should honor that with her.\n\nThat being said, this is most likely the way that she feels that her mother is part of her wedding since her mother cannot be there in person. By keeping that dress from her, you are most likely diminishing what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life.\n\nThis wedding is supposed to be about your daughter, not about you and what you want. This is something within your means that you have the power to give her, it's not out of budget or anything of that nature. So by keeping the dress from her blatantly, you are basically keeping her own mother from her. \n\nGive her the dress to keep for her own happy memories of her mother and hope that one day she can pass it down to her own daughter.", "YTA - just ask yourself, what would your wife have wanted? My guess is, was for her daughter to wear her dress.", "YTA\n\nI think your wife would love her own daughter to wear her wedding dress. It\u2019s very common and super common to have stuff altered.

Altering a dress to fit doesn't change the memory.", "I understand you have an attachment to the dress because you lost your wife, but she also lost her mother. Her loss is no less than yours. \n\nWhat a better way to honour your wife than by letting her daughter wear it? And so what, that it may have to be taken in to fit her? It doesn\u2019t mean the dress will be destroyed, it means it will be used and loved. Try and talk to her to see her point of view. \n\nPlus, it might not be the healthiest for your grieving to have the dress in the closet constantly reminding you of your loss.

Of course she is not and I do understand how bittersweet this would be for you. How does keeping the dress the same and hanging unused in a closet cherish your wife\u2019s memory? For a daughter to want to her mom\u2019s dress is special. Your wife was obviously a special person. Do you think she would have felt honored to have her daughter want to wear her dress? At the very least, it is not insulting to her memory for your daughter to want the dress. Please reconsider from some different perspectives. My best to you.", "YTA - I understand that you want to keep your wife\u2019s memory exactly as it was. This is such a hard decision. I think it is important to think about what your wife would have wanted. It is also important for the daughter to feel her mom at the wedding as she will not be able to be there in person. Wearing her dress sounds like the emotional support that she needs.", "YTA. What are you going to to do with it keep it hanging in a closet til the day you die? You must have so many memories of her. It would be lovely for Anna to wear it, the fact that it has to be modified doesn\u2019t make it any less your wife\u2019s dress as well.", "YTA, why the hell do you think your wife kept the dress?! What were your plans for it, be buried with it upon your death or worse?", "I may get down voted but I say NTA.\n\nWhile its sweet that she wanna wear the dress, I agree it would need to be modified if Anna is skinnier than her mom may \"ruin\" the point it was your wifes. I have \"ruin\" in marks because it does not get ruined it look, rather in size which means its not your wifes anymore. Its your daughters if that happens.\n\nBesides...reading some comments where they be like \"think what your wife would want\" and then say she may wanted that and would had loved I call a bit...bullshit.

Your wife's wedding dress holds deep sentimental value for *both* you and your daughter.

Wearing her mother's wedding dress for her own celebration is how your daughter wants to honor her late mother, and in my personal opinion, it's a great way to do just that, rather than keeping it hidden away in a closet on a hanger forever. \n\nYou should think this through a bit more and be open to seeing this situation from your daughter's point of view instead of just your own.", "Hi! I work professionally altering clothing for repeated use.\n\nA good seamstress-- and if you find one who specializes in bridal wear, they're gonna be *good*-- will be able to alter the dress in order to fit your daughter beautifully AND return it to it's original state.

If it has a seam at the waist, the skirt could be detached, made smaller with a few pleats, and a waist band sewn on. Daughter could then have a complimentary bodice made either in a new style or based on her mom's gown.

I doubt this is really about just wanting the fabric.\n\n2) Is the dress the only item that is regularly viewed as part of their mother? Is the jewelry otherwise forgotten in the back of a drawer, and your daughter does not actively associate it with her mother? Is there another way for your daughter to feel the inclusion of her mother?\n\n3) How did your wife honor her own mother at your wedding? Did they spend days pouring over options for the wedding dress, so the dress felt like a physical manifestation of the bond between mother and daughter? Would your MIL be up for bonding with your daughter this way, especially as your daughter deals with the predatory wedding industry?\n\n4) Would your younger children be interested in creating a tradition to incorporate their mom all of their weddings? Please do not exclude your son: he lost his mom, too. What about sharing a secret recipe of hers, which could then be handed down to all of the children? Did she have a favorite poem? Would a picture of her on a reserved seat be special? \n\nI could not wear my mother's wedding dress, as she was much taller and a different shape than I am. I made my own ribbon bouquet and incorporated fake flowers from her wedding. We literally tied the knot, using ribbons that were sentimental to our families.

It all worked out.", "I don't think you are an AH and I think you are in a difficult situation. My first thought is what would your wife have wanted to be done with the dress? I can completely see your view on this as well. I am also thinking about your youngest daughter and if she also has a desire to utilize the dress. I like your idea of having a wedding dress made in the style of your wife's dress. Your daughter wants a connection to her mother of her wedding day which is understandable. I do have a question about you not letting her wear the veil. The veil should not have to be altered to wear so I am at a loss as to why you won't let it be used. As for the dress on a hanger I cringed, I would recommend getting a mannequin for it and display the dress. Your daughter's dig about you being the gatekeeper of her mother belittles your relationship with your wife. Why would she feel her desire to wear the dress outweighs your connection to your wife and an item that was at a monumentality significant moment in your relationship?", ">She got very upset and told me I can't \"gatekeep\" my wife's memory\n\nThat's a very emotional and not very rational response. Understandably. But your wedding was something special for *you and your wife* - you're allowed to have cherished memories and keepsakes of *your wife* which are separate from everyone's memories of her as their mom.\n\nIf you can't bear to see the dress altered, it's fine to say no. Your daughter is not an AH for asking but should not be pushing you on this.\n\nNTA.", "I think most women keep their wedding dress thinking maybe a future generation will want to use it or have it as a keepsake. Or just because what else do you do with a dress.  We all collect things over our lifetime knowing that we will leave them, and hope someone after us will treasure them, too.  Maybe it would be easier for OP to think about what he would want to happen with his things when he passes? \n\nIt sounds like your daughter would be amenable to only doing minimal alterations to make it fit, and not changing the look of the dress.  If the dress then went back into OPs closet, it would look essentially the same. So the issue is really that the daughter wore the dress at her wedding.  Op needs to examine why he has an issue with this. And why he has put his wife\u2019s memory in a dress? \n\nThink of it from your daughter\u2019s perspective, she grew up seeing that you put her mother\u2019s memory in her wedding dress. So for her the dress is the best way to feel her mother\u2019s presence at her wedding. And by OP saying the dress is mine, is saying that her mother and memory of her mother is OPs.  That is gatekeeping her mother.  Since OPs kids were young when their mother died, all the connection they have to their mother is through what OP shared with them.  If the wedding dress is any indication, it sounds like OP has only considered his own loss and that his wife\u2019s memory is his since he has the most actual memories of her.  There is a profound sense of emptiness for children who don\u2019t have memories from their parents, and their attachment should not be dismissed since they don\u2019t have memories. \n\nOp consider your children\u2019s loss and not just your own.", "You're not an asshole but the grief is making you seem that way. \n\nI feel like 99% of mothers would LOVE to have their daughter wear their wedding dress.\n\nSo that's the only question, would your WIFE, the original owner of the dress want your daughter to wear it.\n\nIf the answer is yes, your daughter is right and you are gatekeeping her mother's memory from her.\n\nI don't really care about everyone else's thoughts, you knew your wife best, be honest with yourself and do as she would want.\n\nCause if she would love her daughter to get the dress and you don't allow it, you will be really selfish towards your children nonetheless.\n\nThe second thing is small but rubbed me the wrong way.

I understand your attachment to it, but what a wonderful way to have your wife/her mother included in the wedding.  Could you even consider that seeing your daughter in that gown might make you feel like a part of your wife is there?  I know it\u2019s rare, but I have seen and read things about wedding dresses that have been passed down and treasured by generations of brides.  The very thought of that, imo, would be amazing and truly keep the memory your wife alive.  I hope you all work it out, and I am very sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "NAH. \n\nI agree that both parties have reasons for why they want the future of the dress to be what they want. Both are valid.\n\nBut as someone who sews, I want to point out two concerns.\n\nFirst, depending on what fabric was used, it might not be in the best condition. Fabrics do break down over time, and bridal fabrics are often considered just for their ability to look good once. They don't always clean well, and even just left on a hanger can get really brittle. Before anyone wears this dress again, the fabric needs to be evaluated.\n\nSecond, resizing complex bridal gowns is not easy and can get very expensive. The alterations that would be needed for the eldest daughter would completely change the gown and the alterations would not be reversible. And depending on the skill of the person doing the alterations, it might not look good on the daughter or look much like the original design. The more beadwork or applique is on the gown, the more of a nightmare it would be.\n\nI think all parties would end up happier with the jewelry and veil as something borrowed/something old, and take the original dress to a skilled dress maker for it to be copied in new fabric to the daughter's proportions. The end dress will almost certainly be a better product and cost less than deconstructing and reconstructing a vintage dress. OP can be at that initial appointment and take the dress home with him once the dressmaker has what they need to copy it.", "NAH. But let me ask you this - if your wife had lived, would SHE have been willing to let Anna wear her dress, alterations and all? It would be a lovely way for Anna to include her late mother in her wedding day. Jewelry is one thing, but the wedding dress is the wedding dress. I understand if you don't want to do this and it is your decision, but is it better to treat the dress as a relic than it is to bring it, and the beautiful memories of your own wedding to a woman you so clearly adored, back into the world on a beautiful day? My only caveat there would be that, IF you allow the dress to be altered, you consider Caroline's body type as well as Anna's so that the dress not be altered in a way that Caroline could not also wear it if she chooses to do so.\n\nAnd remember - it's not a dress that keeps your wife close to you.

Would Anna wearing her dress, even if it needed altered, be something that she would have wanted?\n\nOn one hand, I can understand wanting to keep that piece as close to its original state as possible. On the other hand, I would see this as an opportunity to pass down the hope and love that this dress represents as a way of blessing a new union and carrying your wife's touch onto a new generation. I wish that Anna would have made her desires clear earlier so you'd have more time to think it over. Regardless of that, please take time to really think about it.

The fact that this opinion is downvoted highlights that our world is really conditioned to have a super flawed relationship with grief, and that possessions are more important than memories of those who die. It\u2019s also telling that every one of you thinks the loss of his wife outweighs the loss his children experienced. I genuinely hope you never have an heirloom withheld from you because the other party refused to cope with their grief rationally. If the dress is his only object left from his wife, what happened to everything from their 16 (at least) year relationship? That\u2019s WEIRD, and the fact I\u2019m getting downvoted for questioning that is not only bizarre but also makes me worried for critical reasoning skills. \n\nMy moms grandfather was a jeweler, so my family has a lot of stuff he made.

That kind of attitude was the final wedge between me and one of my Aunts because every time she would lend me a piece, there were so many terms and conditions, which included her \u201cchecking on\u201d the piece (I could only wear them when also in her presence). It made me feel like she didn\u2019t trust me. \n\nRecently, she talked about lending me another piece for my cousins wedding and I was excited because it was a piece I\u2019ve *always* loved, but steeling myself for the distrustful energy. She gave it to me that night, and didn\u2019t check on it at all. It\u2019s also fully mine now. Our relationship has been improving since. (The piece was a symbol, not bribery, though.)\n\nI share this because I feel for your tragedy and clearly the way that you\u2019ve grown around your grief includes centering it somehow. I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re an AH here at all, but I do hope you take some time to really explore your daughters perspective, because there\u2019s validity there, too. She wants her mother present on this day because otherwise her mom *can\u2019t* be there. I understand that you lost your wife, but your children also lost their mother. I saw someone say in another comment thread that the dress was being used, but I wholeheartedly disagree. It\u2019s use is simply to highlight its unuse and her absence. If it were in a shadow box hung with prominence in your house, maybe I\u2019d feel differently, but it\u2019s not being used. It\u2019s hanging in your closet for all of your children to see. \n\nI ask that you really think about what your wife would want here because that\u2019s what you should do. And I\u2019ll say that if your wife really loved weddings as much as you claimed in your post, I feel like she would have loved the sentimentality of your daughters request! Plus, there are some highly skilled seamstresses who could see what could be done minimally to make the dress usable with little to no damage. So while I get why you\u2019re saying no, I also see exactly why your children (and members of your family) feel like you\u2019re gatekeeping your wife\u2019s memory. Reading your post and some of your commentary, I can\u2019t quite shake the feeling you\u2019ve forgotten that your kids lost her, too.", "But you haven't given a good reason as to why you won't let her use the veil", "I think moms often save their dresses with this in mind but 25-30 years later\u2026styles change, daughters want their own dress, they don\u2019t fit into mom\u2019s dress, the dress is associated with a failed marriage, etc. Lots can happen.", "I agree with everything you are saying. I was just offering perspective, not judgement.

The younger one doesn\u2019t want it altered at all. Why does Anna\u2019s feelings get to trump hers? Compromise here would be neither one gets the dress aside from as a reference point.", "Op said in an other coment that she want to alter the veil because she want a shorter veil.", "OP said elsewhere that Anna wants to cut it down to make a shorter veil. So like the dress, it would never be the same again after she\u2019s done with it.", "And what would your wife have wanted? The dress to sit gathering dust to for her daughter to wear it?", "My suspicion, like I said. And being a mother to two girls myself. And being a daughter. And a woman. And a human.

As a woman getting ready to get married she should be a little more understanding to her father's feelings for this dress.. she herself is entering into an adult union with no children as of yet.. her wedding is her memory with her husband.

OP says his children loved and admired the dress while they were growing up, and their wedding photos were displayed throughout their house. Seeing as how Anna would have only been 8 years old when her mother died, it would make sense that those wedding photos of her mother wearing that dress would be very prominent in Anna's limited memories of her. So, it seems like the dress does have a lot of sentimental value to her as well as OP.", "Most likely. The dress is, what, 30 years old at most? I've worked with dresses twice that and they held up.

If his wife passed recently, I could understand the attachment to the dress, but it's been reverently worshipped by OP for the last 16 years. That's not healthy, no matter what. Letting his daughter wear it isn't going to destroy her mother, but OP seems to think it will. Again, not healthy. There's a difference between an item being sentimental & reminding someone of their loved one, but the amount of emotion that Op has invested in this dress, is not good.", "If the wife was as \"chubby\" as OP states, the dress could easily be restored afterwards. It doesn't sound like Anna wants to do more than just have it sized, which isn't a major alteration. It'd be different if Anna wanted to drastically change to it, but it sounded like she just wanted to have it fit. While the younger daughter may want it now, she also may change her mind.

Everyone made minor changes here & there, but the original integrity of the dress was maintained.", "I mean, the younger daughter doesn't get any of that either, and she may not get to wear the dress after her sister modifies it. Isn't it better to not let either of them wear it than only letting one get that chance? OP did say in a comment that the younger daughter also doesn't want the older sister to modify the dress.

Changing that is the issue from what I can see from his post and comments. He's viewing it as a tangible physical representation of his wife's form on one of the happiest days of their lives together.

There are ways to take a dress in while preserving the dress for others. My understanding of the \u201calterations\u201d in question were because they were different sizes \u2014 which implies she wants to *wear her mother\u2019s dress*. Not a dress made from her mothers dress. This would preserve the dress for the other two children if they also wish to wear it. Altering dresses, especially wedding dresses, is a super common practice and a lot of seamstresses are used to these kinds of requests and will let you know where it is or isn\u2019t possible. But to pretend that \u201ctaking a dress in\u201d is akin to changing it completely, especially when OP says nothing to suggest that, is weird. \n\nSince you want to bring the \u201cother two kids\u201d into it, how is it fair that their father thinks that the loss of his wife outweighs the loss of their mother? Claims that this dress is \u201call he has left\u201d of his wife are kinda grody, considering those *three* kids that have more of his wife in them than the dress hanging in the closet\u2026", "I mean, cool, but picking up on some of the between lines of OPs post and follow up comments, it kinda feels like he\u2019s choosing this dress *over* his daughter and her ability to have her mother present on her wedding day through sharing in something that was clearly so important to her mother. I think it\u2019s gross to act like his loss is greater or worse than the loss the kids experienced. Based on the story he tells us, he *is* gatekeeping the memory and doing trauma Olympics with his own kids. I think OP needs to go to grief counseling because it\u2019s hard to lose a partner and coping with grief is inherently difficult. I\u2019m not even calling OP an AH, I think this is a NAH situation, but also see how he\u2019s pushing his kids away (all three of them, even if the youngest agrees with him right now) through this choice. He\u2019s not the AH, but his daughter also wouldn\u2019t be the AH if his decision damaged their relationship for a long time. That\u2019s my opinion, and I share how similar behaviors from my family have caused rifts above. You\u2019re entitled to disagree, but I do hope that you have more to back up your opinion than is shared because, frankly, that worries me as someone who has lost a lot of people prematurely, like OP and his children, because tying loss to things can make it difficult to coexist with your grief, which is a clear underlying theme in this post, even if OP isn\u2019t fully aware of it.", "This is not your grief or you way of grieving. It is not the same for everyone.", "I don\u2019t know anything about dressmaking but if they keep the extra fabric can it be put back or would that not work?", "Why is Anna more important than OP. This is obviously important to him. This was from a time before Anna.

The dress is from your wedding which was something solely between you and your wife. Your wedding day was an event specific to you and your wife. It was an event that was about her being your partner. Your wedding wasn't about your children it was only about you and your wife. That is your very and extremely personal event and memory for you. NTA. If you don't want the dress altered you are fine. Totally understandable. Let her wear the jewelry. If she wants to cut the veil I understand not letting her take the veil. What your daughter doesn't understand is how extremely personal and huge that wedding day is to you, especially because the sole person that experienced that with you is gone.", "If the dress hasn't been properly preserved and has just been hanging in the closet for 20+ years, it's going to be unwearable at this point.

Perhaps she could have minor alterations & wear it for the ceremony, and switch to her own dress at the reception?

Isn\u2019t it likely they they would have directly inherited her dress and her jewellery?  \n\nI think it\u2019s important that you really, truly consider yourself as a custodian of her things in this case, as well as what daughters might traditionally expect to inherit from their mothers or experience with their mothers on their wedding day.

It\u2019s also quite traditional, especially in the case of a mother being gone and unable to witness or attend, for the dress to be incorporated into the daughter\u2019s wedding in some way, even if in pieces.

Really think about the fact that Anna truly does consider this to be her *mother\u2019s* dress.. and that she wants to wear her *mother\u2019s* dress as a way of having her mother with her at the wedding.\n\nI feel for all of you.

His other daughter does not want Anna chopping the veil or dress so in this case, I would bet the wife would say no.", "NTA, and also seamstress here. Altering this dress is just a bad idea if the hope is to get it back and continue loving it as you currently are. I know you have many comments already but here is the language you need to know to make your case as you navigate this tricky issue. I have altered many wedding dresses, I was a professional seamstress for years. Once altered you are correct it would 100% become Anna\u2019s dress and even if the plan going into the alteration is \u201ctake it in then let it back out\u201d you wouldn\u2019t be able to do that and return it to what it was.\n\n1) finding a seamstress talented and understanding enough to perform such an alteration with the utmost care is neither easy or cheap. Seamstresses at bridal boutiques who alter dresses bought at the boutique are accustomed to working from certain brands and types of dresses. They estimate their time and price with general working knowledge of the dress. Someone brought me a modern wedding dress made by a cheaper Chinese vendor a couple years ago and it followed none of the sewing conventions of a 10 or 20k wedding dress you\u2019d buy in the states from a major brand. A vintage custom dress is going to be just as much of a random dice roll, with decisions made by the original maker not necessarily making logical sense to a modern bridal alteration seamstress. The seamstress could become very frustrated trying to make the type of reversable alteration you\u2019d be after, and frustrated seamstresses is not what you want. You can\u2019t exactly stand next to her and make sure she isn\u2019t butchering the item internally. You can tell her \u201cI want it to be restored afterward\u201d but it will all be hidden behind a lining when it comes back, and reversing the alterations won\u2019t necessarily be her problem, so there\u2019s zero guarantee your wishes will be respected and the fabric won\u2019t just get stitched, slashed, and removed while it\u2019s out of your hands. If that happens it can\u2019t ever go backwards. I personally wouldn\u2019t trust another seamstress to do this alteration and respect the memory of your wife. The job is well paying but it\u2019s not THAT well paying. \n\n2) an item of this age will likely be more damaged by the alteration than a newer item. Fabric becomes brittle overtime, and even if vintage items are still wearable they don\u2019t bounce back as readily, meaning they\u2019re more likely to hold shape of the wearer, or break when worn (stitching in particular can break because the threads and fabric degrade on different timelines, same goes for any other contrasting material, or stabilizing lining material). You can\u2019t just wash a wedding dress afterwards like a vintage tee shirt either to make it snap back\u2026dry cleaning isn\u2019t really washing something either. Wearing a wedding dress for a day, you will move and sweat and it takes on the creases and folds and curves of your body. Even if Anna was the same body type as your wife the dress would change from being worn. Creases and folds and very importantly the smell of the dress will be very different.\n\n3) altering a wedding dress is not as simple as taking it in and letting it out again later. I don\u2019t know the dress style but they\u2019re generally very precision garments and excess fabric must be removed to get the sculpted look. When I alter a wedding dress I cut and remove a fair bit of fabric and if I didn\u2019t the dress would look poor on the outside due to the additional bulk of fabric folded and creased inside. In some cases you wouldn\u2019t even have the option of not cutting it because some seams require a perpendicular cut to the stitch to get the seam to lay correctly on the finished side. Without the perpendicular cuts the fabric puckers on the finished side and won\u2019t lie or fit correctly. Stitch marks also damage fabric. Even if the fabric could all be maintained and the original cut restored you\u2019d be adding thousands of needle holes to the fabric. Bridal fabric is NOT forgiving to needle holes. Even if the best silk needles are used there will be visible holes afterward if new stitches are added and removed. They won\u2019t necessarily disappear even if dry cleaned or pressed out, nor will creases from pressing the fabric to the new shape. Also pressing the fabric, especially older fabric, risks damage as well.\n\nThe user who commented that a small piece could be taken (from the main dress but also from the lining or veil or whatever) and added to your girls\u2019 own, new dresses, is definitely the way to go, because it allows a small enough piece of fabric to be taken from the main dress in a way that can be done artistically without compromising the rest. Something like a diamond keyhole could be made with with fresh embroidery to finish the new raw edge on the old dress would be a small permanent change but one that retains the general integrity of the dress. Plus it can be taken from a less visible area of the dress that won\u2019t alter your experience of it.\n\nI also quite like the comment one user said about it still being in use. I think that\u2019s very correct. The kids need to understand the dress, to you, has become like a custom portrait or sculpture of your wife. It\u2019s not just a dress that can be borrowed, worn, taken off, and returned. The accommodation Anna is asking for is more like asking you to let an oil painter paint Anna\u2019s portrait over your wife\u2019s portrait, then giving it back later and expecting you to be able to relate to it in the same way you relate to it now. As a seamstress I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s not possible. It would be the portrait of Anna for the rest of time. Your wife may have loved to give the dress to her daughters one day but your wife also left this world too early and the happiness of everyone she loved still on earth would matter to her. Her decision would be different in this circumstance than it would be if she was alive. As others have said you have two daughters. That changes the calculus considerably.\n\nGood luck OP.", "Is saving the dress matters that much, take it a dry cleaner that cleans, preserves, and boxes wedding gowns.", "YTA, albeit possibly the smallest one imaginable.

Your daughter is right that you can't \"gatekeep\" your wife's memory; but she's wrong about the dress, which is *your* personal belonging.

Keep it for yourself since it indeed makes it easier for you to go through life after your loss.  You may want to consider moving it to someplace where it can be locked up safely, in the meantime.

BUT PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE COMMENT.\n\nI think allowing her to take photos and allow her an opportunity to replicate the dress is an extremely rational middle ground compromise. You're also allowing her to borrow the jewelry so I think that's also a good way of having her mother with her. The reality is, that was your wife and she wore that dress on not just her day but yours, too. And if that's what you've been keeping to honour and remember her because of such a cherished memory, then I think it's fair for you to decide what to do with it.\n\nAdding into the fact that you also have another daughter who may or may not want to borrow it down the line if you open up the possibility for the other, the dress's constitution could be at risk especially if this many years have passed. Preserving dresses is taken very seriously, look at the recent Kardashian fiasco.\n\nAs someone who lost her mother as a teenager, I would completely understand if my dad had the same logic. But I think he would also understand mine and he would most likely allow it if I asked. Similar to you, he and my mom were very in love and their wedding day was very special to them. I can understand your daughter feeling like it would make her day perfect, and of course she loved her mother and feels that that would be her way of honouring her and having her with her, so nobody can be upset with her for how she feels, either.\n\nHowever....\n\nI think it's also worth considering, since this IS a very difficult question to answer, it's definitely not black and white... as a father, what's more important to you? A material item with sentimental value or your relationship with your daughter and making her happy and feel closer to her mother on one of the most beautiful days of her life? It's important to remember that though the dress may be one thing you have left of your wife, you also have something I would argue is more important than a wedding dress: 2 beautiful children who are literally a living embodiment of you and your wife's love. If they're not proof that your wife existed and loved you, then nothing else is.\n\nIf your wife were still alive, would she have allowed your daughter to borrow and alter the dress if she asked? If you answer yes, then I think you have your answer, as difficult as it may be for you. That in itself would be a proper way to honour your wife, as you would be channeling her wishes and allowing her to live on in your daughter (I mean, she already does, but you know what I mean).\n\nParents make sacrifices for their children out of love. I don't think your relationship with your daughter is worth straining for this. What would your wife say to you? If you do feel that she would allow it, and even WANT it, then you might say you're being a little selfish to only think about what you want. And that's just it, too. Maybe your wife would actually really want your daughter to wear her dress, I know a lot of mothers get extremely happy when their daughters request this.\n\nSide note: Depending on the fabric, alterations can be reversed. They can just take the dress in and release it when she's done with it. Or, if they do end up cutting it, you can use the excess fabric to have other things made from it to honour your wife. A garter, a mini version of the dress, or something for you to wear on special occasions, like a handkerchief for a suit or tux. Or even a tie, though I'm not sure where you would wear a white tie? But even then, you don't need to wear it, you could also just hang it in your closet.\n\nHope this helps. At the end of the day, I'm sure no one would want such a conflict to exist over a dress. My advice would be to live in the present, and to make for beautiful future memories, not to sacrifice what's important to preserve the past ones. \n\nI do empathize, and I'm really sorry you lost your wife", "NTA\n\nAnyone voting otherwise has never had a dress altered. \n\nTo have the dress altered in such a way that any changes could be reversible would take a very, very skilled seamstress/seamster who makes absolutely zero mistakes. Most would turn down the job for exactly this reason. Ruining a priceless heirloom just isn't worth the pay for the job. So alterations would very likely be irreversible. \n\nYour daughter may be reacting to the idea that wearing her mother's dress would \"ruin\" it. While this is true from an alteration standpoint in that it would fundamentally change the dress, she may just be reacting to the emotional impact of that word. It would be pretty upsetting to hear that you using a treasured item from a loved one would ruin it, even if you could step away and accept that as true. \n\nIt might be worth just apologizing for hurting her feelings and explaining that there's no guarantee that any alterations made could be undone, so you're very set on keeping it as-is. That said, you would still like to find a way to incorporate her mother's gown or veil, if possible. You could even just ask if there is some piece of the gown/veil she is really looking to capture. \n\nAs a side note, if your daughter has a very different body frame than your late wife, there's a very good chance the gown will look quite different on her, especially once it's been altered. It would be a crying shame to alter it only for her to realize the look simply doesn't suit her taste or flatter her shape.

Sharing is great but somewhere along the way, someone's going to want to keep it.\n\nI just have a nightmare scenario in my mind that Anna gets the dress, alters it to fit her, then adds some more modifications to suit her taste and make it more modern. (ie. adds sleeves, a lace overlay, removes bows or flounces) and now we have a dress that hardly resembles the original. Then Anna puts it into her closet as it's \"her\" wedding dress from her special day and her younger sister has no chance. And she will be here in AITA asking \"my dad let my sister borrow and alter our mother's wedding dress for her wedding; now I'm getting married and she refuses to let me have it because it's 'hers'. I got upset and family is calling me an AH. AITA?\"\n\nI think OP is right to offer photo sessions with the original dress clamped back, allowing the daughters to wear their mother's jewelry (no alterations needed) and offering to pay for a replica to be custom made.\n\nNone of this would be a problem if he had one daughter, but he does. Safest bet is to help both get their own dresses.", "Women typically take some \"getting ready\" sentimental photos with their mothers on the morning of the wedding,  putting their bridal dress on, etc.\n\nWhat if OP suggested the daughter uses mom's dress for a photoshoot during this time, no alterations. A compromise. They could clip the back of the dress like they do in bridal salons, so it would fit without making any permanent alternations to the dress. And, she would have her own dress to change into, so it would still fully be OPs wife's dress, and the daughter would have her own.\n\nBut it would give her a beautiful moment on her wedding day where she'd get to feel her mother with her, and wear the dress that's been connected to her mom in her heart since the day OP hung it in the closet.", "He's living, and this is about him, not his wife.\n\nAlso \"for the living\" would mean that what the wife would want wouldn't matter, and I don't really agree with that. I think if his wife would love her to wear the dress, he should do it, even if it's not 100% what he wants.", "You keep saying the dress is special. I dont hear you say your daughter is more special. You need to get professional help with this", "My older sister wore our late mums dress for her wedding. \n\nAs the younger sister I have absolutely no qualms about her doing that and altering the dress. I love my sister and I'm glad I got to see her wear it.", "Not necessarily. I\u2019m about to have a custom dress made that matches my personality, but would never dream of any of my girls wearing it unless it really resonated with them. And I wouldn\u2019t want them to fight over it, for sure. I think either the suggestions of letting them use the jewelry or veil unaltered, or allowing them to cut an inside piece from an unobtrusive piece of the dress (like the back inside liner or something) to stitch into theirs, or make it into something like a flower or something special to have with them. Or the idea of a photo shoot with Mom\u2019s gown while getting ready is also beautiful. \n\nIn the end NAH; they all have valid reasons for their feelings. I feel for OP a lot, as a guy who describes his wife as \u201cthe love of his life\u201d and was a widower who raised three young children without her after she passed. I hope he can sit down with his kids and be open and honest and vulnerable with them, and help them understand why he feels how he does and reach a compromise that makes them all happy.", "That\u2019s probably why she wants to wear it, so that her mother will be a part of the ceremony.", "It will never be meaningless. It belonged to a person, a person who was here and whose life had meaning. She was OP's wife and the mother of his children. I would hardly call that meaningless.", "Idk much about dress alterations, so I'll assume altering the dress 3 times (for 3 daughters on the assumption that they'll get married one day and would eant the dress) is either impossible or possibly damaging to the dress.  \n  \nI worry letting the eldest have it and not extending that permission to the 3rd (or even the 2nd) kid might build resentment between the siblings. I seriously doubt that's what the mother would've wanted.  \n  \nRegardless, I think the best thing to do here is to talk to each other, possibly with the whole DIRECT family.

My response wasn\u2019t great. I get that but you\u2019re applying your circumstance to every one and it was super nice of you to give that dress to your sister.

Either way, I feel like the importance placed on the dress is OP's doing, unintentionally.   \n\n\nHe's placed such importance on THIS piece of his wife that his children likely now associate that with \"mom\" instead of other things.

A few weeks later when we were all at my parents house my mom took us to her jewelry box and just asked which ones we liked.  We had a fun time going through everything and my mom realized she was spot on with some assumptions, but others she was way off base when it came to who would like what.\n\nFor the record, I was 100% correct. My sister said the aforementioned ring was quite beautiful but it\u2019s not one she could ever see herself wearing.\n\nBut also, this applies to EVERYTHING. My grandpa died when my mom was relatively young (20\u2019s) and her siblings fought viciously over who got what because my grandparents hadn\u2019t determined who would get what before he passed. My parents learned from this and have pretty clearly communicated that they have decided and documented who will inherit what between my sister, my brother, and me when their time comes. After this incident with the ring my parents have been even more open about who they plan to give what, and take our input into consideration.", "Was that because the mom didn't want them to or because the woman in question wanted to pick her own dress?", "It doesn't have to be \"hacked apart\" to be made to fit. OP has stated that his daughter is smaller in size than his late wife was. As long as the size difference isn't catastrophic, things like darts can be used across the back of the dress to effectively bring the dress in without altering it permanently. The darts and hiding of the back panel will be hidden by hair and/or the veil.\n\nMost wedding dresses will be well out of style by the time the next generation or two comes around, you only have to look back through the history of wedding attire to see that. Unless someone specifically wants *that* dress, most will just hang in a closet or be put in a box and disposed of eventually.", "I came looking for this comment.

Any major changes to the dress should be off the table, but if you decided you may want it to have a life after your gone, you might want to talk to a seamstress and see if it\u2019s possible to make fitting adjustment that would leave the integrity of the dress, while allowing for different people to wear it in the future.", "I met my husband very young, we have 2 daughters. I am horrified to think of him refusing if I had passed away and one of my daughters wanted that badly to wear my wedding dress.

You clearly loved your wife very much and that dress helps you get through your day-to-day life while keeping her in your memories. You said you already distributed some of your wife's belongings among the children so they all have something to remember her by, and your special belonging is that dress.\n\nThat dress was what your beloved wife wore on the day she walked down the aisle and your vows to one another were exchanged. I'm sure by the way you talk about her and the dress, that was one of the happiest days of your life.\n\nIt's okay that no one will use the dress anymore. It's okay to let yourself have this. Don't back down my guy, you sound like a very caring and selfless father and this is the one thing you don't want to give away and that is totally okay. Even as a father you are allowed to have boundaries and to keep a piece of your wife close to your heart.\n\nMaybe you can invite Anna to a meal together, say that you'd like to talk to her. You should explain that this is the one belonging you cannot give away because it brings you back to your wedding and it helps you get ready every day. Tell her that the dress not having your wife's body shape anymore would be heartbreaking, and reiterate that you're willing to help her as much as you possibly can to get an accurate replica made that fits her. But really try to bare your emotions to her because it's important that you convey all the feelings attached to that dress and why it's so unique to you. She probably just sees the situation as you leaving the dress there to rot for no reason, I'm assuming you've mentioned to her that you look at it every day before going to work and why.\n\nParents are expected to give and give and give, but parents are human too, and you can have sentimental belongings that you wouldn't be willing to give away.

I hope someone reminds your daughter that a wedding doesn't make a marriage and she shouldn't cause a big fuss over a few hours. It's not worth the relationships she will damage in the long run. \n\nWish you both healing and understanding and I hope she has a lovely wedding and happy marriage ahead!", " NAH, because this is an awful situation. You don\u2019t want your daughter to alter the dress or veil so you won\u2019t let her borrow either. Your eldest daughter is lashing out at you because she is hurt and angry. Your younger daughter is upset because she doesn\u2019t want her sister to get to use these items as it will make the connection between the dress and her mom\u2019s memory weaker as her sister will have worn it last.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to do alter either, but I want to suggest something for you to discuss with your kids, and only your kids - this is a decision for the four of you and not for friends and family to weigh in on. \n\nWife/Mom\u2019s veil is cathedral length, that\u2019s generally 110\u201d or so. Quite long. This is a length very rarely used anymore. You could take this veil to a seamstress who specialises in wedding alterations or millinery (hats) and ask them to divide the fabric into 3 usable pieces. Potentially, and only if your son agrees, he might get a smaller piece IF 3 even sized pieces would mean the pieces would be too small for the daughters to use as part of a veil with for their own weddings. They wouldn\u2019t need to have their piece be the only material they use in their veil but it can be a featured part of it. Your girls will then be able to feel like they have their mother with them on their wedding day, which is what this is really all about.\n\nWith this compromise, you keep the dress whole. All three children get something as well that they can then use as they want when their wedding comes. Everyone gets to keep something that\u2019s incredibly important and meaningful to them. You can hold on to your son\u2019s piece and younger daughter\u2019s piece until their wedding comes to ensure they don\u2019t get lost or inadvertently ruined.\n\nI know you\u2019re going to balk at the idea of letting go of the veil, but I encourage you to think about it. Think on what is really important here. It\u2019s not actually the veil itself, is it? It\u2019s the memories and the connection with your wife/their mom. But you will still have the entire wedding dress. They don\u2019t get to have memories of their mom at their wedding, so I hope you\u2019ll find a way to let them have something they can keep. Lending the jewellery is the right thing to do, but it\u2019s just a loan. It\u2019s not the same as something they can keep forever. Something of their mom that is theirs, that they can hold onto forever. \n\nWhatever you do, PLEASE go get the dress professionally professionally preserved ASAP. Here is a link to an article online about it: https://www.thespruce.com/wedding-gown-maintenance-2147341 \n\nFinally, you should have a discussion with your kids about what happens to that dress when you die or get remarried. You need to make a decision about that but it\u2019s good to get their input first even if you don\u2019t agree with them or choose to go with any options they put forward.\n\nOP, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in this situation. I hope you find a way to let go of at least the veil. I know it\u2019s yours and that you\u2019re struggling with the idea of anyone touching it much less altering it. But please keep in mind that your kids have so little of their mother. Your eldest was only 12  when she died and the youngest won\u2019t have any memories of her at all. \n\nThey won\u2019t have memories of her at their weddings to look back on. You gifting them something physical of their mom\u2019s for their weddings that they can each keep forever is likely to be as important to them as the dress is to you.", "You aren\u2019t \u2018gate keeping\u2019 and you are doing the right thing.  Whatever it is that you need to do to keep your mental health, healthy, you do it (within reason obviously). \n\nYou also have 2 daughters, so that dress could potentially be altered twice?

If she didn\u2019t have to alter it then I would\u2019ve said yes.

I don\u2019t always agree that the spouse of the deceased should get to decide what happens to all of their belongings (you know, like the way legally it\u2019s like spouse > children > grandparents > other blood relatives etc. and all the ways formally and informally we decide who is entitled to what based on the nuclear family structure and disregarding other kinship arrangements and relationships etc. etc. BUT I DIGRESS.) But given the context, OP\u2019s wishes for whether HIS DECEASED WIFE\u2019S WEDDING DRESS FROM THEIR WEDDING should be altered, reappropriated, etc. should absolutely be respected. Like, to me, it\u2019s not even who is in possession of the dress and should dictate what happens to it, you know? Even if we view it as a shared memento, this is a situation I think where unless everyone involved feels good about it and gives their blessing, it\u2019s a no.\n\nAnna\u2019s totally the asshole for not simply expressing disappointment and then accepting it and letting it go when you said no, man. I can\u2019t imagine ever feeling good about doing anything to the dress knowing I pressured/guilted my dad into giving it up.\n\nI do love the idea of incorporating design elements from the dress to honour your wife/you two\u2019s love. And I think the other suggestions about a compromise (e.g. sewing in small pieces from the veil into both daughters\u2019 dresses, or letting her wear the veil) are fine, but only if you actually want to do it. Having Anna wear the jewelry is plenty.", "NTA. For me this is a situation where the decision must be unanimous. The fact that your late wife was your wife is equally as important as the fact that she was your daughter's mother. So since your daughter's wish would in your eyes destroy an important object for you to remember your wife by, then she shouldn't have the right to fullfil it. \nBut you both should compromise, letting her borrow the jewelry is one thing, maybe giving her one of the pieces of jewelry could make her feel more close to her mom? Maybe let her have the veil since she wouldn't have to alter it and even if she did it isn't as important as the dress itself? Maybe let her cut a small piece of the dress so that she can integrate it to her own dress? I feel like there's room for compromise.", "NTA. Borrowing implies you will have it returned to you in the same condition it was loaned out in. This won\u2019t be the case, so no they cannot \u201cborrow\u201d the dress.", "NTA. I mean, apart from all the other considerations that everyone's been putting up, it's quite possible that OP and his wife had some tender or intimate moments while she was wearing that dress. No wonder he doesn't want Anna getting her paws on it!", "NAH. But OP, I lost my mom when I was in my early 20s, and she never saw my sister and I marry. Her dress was classic 70s, do we chose not to wear it, but we did wear her veil. It made her so close in our special day. Can  you compromise and let her wear the veil at least?", "I'm going to advise you to rent a storage locker and put the dress (and anything else you don't want to \"mysteriously\" go missing) in there until after the wedding. And tell no one about it. I have a feeling that your daughter may try to spirit it out of the house one day while you aren't there to stop her.", "NTA. Some dresses shouldn't be altered or used again.", "NTA", "Nobody is an AH here. I don\u2019t blame your daughter for wanting to wear her mom\u2019s wedding dress that she\u2019s always loved. She would have been 8 when her mom died and it would have been as heartbreaking for her as it was for you. Would altering the dress make it too small for your younger daughter? Does she have any desire to wear it? What would your wife have wanted? Personally, the idea of my daughter wearing my wedding dress thrills me. I wouldn\u2019t stop her from wearing at least the veil, while understanding your desire to keep it as only ever worn by your wife. This is such a hard one that only you can resolve. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. I think your daughter isn't looking at this issue from both sides. Perhaps you could offer to pay to have an identical dress made in her size?", "The conversation now is about Anna. If the dress is altered, does this have an impact on Caroline's options later on?", "NTA. You have two daughters and they both may end up wanting to wear the dress if one does and it might be impossible to have it altered for your younger daughter if the older one alters it now. Having a replica made is a good compromise because then she can keep and do whatever she wants with her own dress. You aren't gate keeping anything. That's your wife's wedding dress and she's gone and while if she was alive she might have been ok with her daughter wearing the dress she's not here to make that decision and whether she likes it or not that dress is your property now.", "NAH but I get your thought. She wouldn't be borrowing it because significant alterations would need to be made. Maybe a swatch from moms dress would suffice? I wore a swatch from my grandmother and mother's dresses. They pinned them into my dress right before walking down the aisle. It was a really special moment.", "OOFFF. Tough one. For a start there\u2019s already too many cooks in this kitchen, so try to ignore the noise coming from anyone other than you and your daughter.  Is there a way of altering without cutting? Ie could it be altered back easily? I would have a think about how you would feel seeing her in the dress as well. Could this be a wonderful moment for you and your daughter? Or would seeing her in the dress make her wedding harder for you? Be honest about that with her. Your wedding (I\u2019m assuming) is a precious memory that you have lived and your children haven\u2019t - so that\u2019s important for them to understand as well. If you are concerned about wear or spills - could it be worn only for ceremony or photos? This is a very emotional issue for you all, and it might be worth taking a little time just you and her to get to the core of it. She may have imagined herself in this dress her whole life - so be kind and gentle.", "NTA because she'd need to alter it. If she could wear it without alterations, I would say maybe consider it, but the fact that it would need major alterations to fit makes you not the ah. I would consider allowing her to borrow the veil under the condition that it is not altered in any way and returned with the jewelry as soon as the wedding is over", "NAH. What an incredibly tough situation for you all. If possible, sit down with both daughters and talk about what the dress means to you all and try and find a solution. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up the memory of your wife in that dress any more than your daughter should miss out on wearing her Mum\u2019s dress on her special day. \n\nThis is going to take some compromise and understanding from all parties.", "NTA They are your memories to gatekeep.", "NTA. If she could wear it without significantly altering it, i might think differently.

I know you are grieving your wife, (I recently lost my dad, so I get it), but your daughter lost her mother, the one person all daughters want at their wedding. She doesn\u2019t get to have that. But you can give it to her and you are refusing because of your own sadness and heartache. \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t seem like it, but it is just a dress. I feel like there are so many other things of your wife\u2019s that are more important to be cherished. How would your wife feel? I bet she\u2019d be thrilled. I doubt she would hesitate to have her daughter wear her dress at her wedding and wouldn\u2019t think twice about it being altered. Remember, your daughter is grieving too. And she should be able to have her mother as close to her as possible on her special day. For what it\u2019s worth, it is possible to take in a dress without permanently altering it.", "YTA That is her late mother\u2019s wedding dress and a beautiful way to include her and honor her in her marriage. You should be able to see the beauty in that. You keep referring to her as \u2018your wife\u2019 but that woman was also your daughter\u2019s mother who passed away when she was 8 yrs old, so she likely has some significant memory of her. I\u2019m sure your wife would have loved to have been able to contribute to her daughter\u2019s wedding, don\u2019t stand in the way of that being able to happen.

But she\u2019s gone and your daughter is here and present and wants to create her own memories - and the row of you could create something.l truly special through it. \nLooking back at the past that no longer exists stops you from living for the future of your family. That\u2019s where your life is happening. You don\u2019t have to let go,  but you can create something new and beautiful out of it. \nAs a dad, the AH part is keeping yourself tied to a pain that only exists to keep you from moving into memories of joy and gratitude / because it means she gone - gone and that finality is the last line (at least it was for me). I\u2019ve been there, brother and it will never, ever serve you or the love you have for your wife or I presume you have for her children to lock yourself away from living with your family in the present. \nJust MHO.", "You are a bit YTA. \n Its YOUR daughter who both wants to honor her parents.

You're being heartless here.", "You're holding on to the past so hard you're willing to sacrifice the future relationship with your daughter. She can't have her mother at her wedding and hasn't had her in most of her life; I'm guessing this is her way of including her mother in her life and special event. I understand that this is hard, but your unwillingness or inability to understand where your daughter is coming from is very concerning. Soft YTA, because it's about emotion, but you need to address those emotions so you can be present for your kids, and you haven't done that.", "YTA \n\nNot once in this post have you mentioned what you think your wife/their mother would want. On a gentler note, I think you have maybe not processed your grief as much as you think you have. Might be time to check in with a therapist?", "YTA. Really your not going to let your daughter wear the dress? What good is the dress doing in your closet? This was her mothers dress, this is a way for your daughter to have her mother at the wedding. Just let your daughter wear the dress.", "This is the question. You would be honoring the wife by having your daughter wear it.", "I don't know, I don't think so, I remember when we were planning the wedding the dress was very hard since the fabric was too delicate. I'm not sure if It can go back to normal if Anna wears it. \n\nYes, I never dated again, I'll never love another woman like I love her. Our kids and her are my world.", "OP says it\u2019s been hanging in a closet so I\u2019d bet it\u2019s not in condition yo survive significant alterations, or even wearable at all. \n\nWe pulled my husband\u2019s late wife\u2019s dress out when their daughters got married and even having been preserved and stored properly it was not alterable. It could have been worn for pictures, but the hand made lace (made by their mother and grandmother) was just too delicate for anything else.

So so funny.", "I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair to call someone an asshole for their feelings of grief about their dead mother coming out in a complicated and emotionally fraught situation. Someone can be more in the wrong without being an asshole.

With sizing it up, you might be able to add panels, if the design allows for them.  There's so much that goes into alteration that you'd need a professional to look at the dress itself to make a call on it.", "That depends a lot on what you're doing. Simple size alterations are unlikely to cost as much as a full dress.", "I wore my mother\u2019s dress but she had bought one that was a bit larger and taken it in. All we had to do was let it out.
