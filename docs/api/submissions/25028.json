And unfortunately alcohol does affect your need to pee and can cause the sensation to come on a Hella lot quicker than if you were sober. It happens to me all the time, go for a wee before we leave a pub and by the time we get home I am busting so much I'm in pain. \nFrom the sounds of it it's not like you make a habit of it.

It was late night, no one around, and holding it like that can cause a UTI. He sounds controlling and when you don't do what he says, he gets pissed... no pun intended.

First, if you're at an age where you're coming home drunk at 4am you're old enough to find a bathroom regularly and young enough to empty your bladder when you use it.
