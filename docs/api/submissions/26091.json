Good job protecting your baby.", "NTA Your are being really kind bcz she would no longer be permitted in my home.", "NTA no person regardless of relationship or not should EVER kiss a new born baby!", "NTA I would tell your family you're not overreacting and if your child gets extremely sick none of them will be in the hospital saying it was just a kiss.

I've read some horrible stories about babies getting illnesses from relatives who kiss them without permission.  One was even about a baby went blind after contracting herpes from a relative who kissed her on the face despite having a cold sore.  Children can also get diseases like whooping cough from an unvaccinated relative.  Especially because she was premature and had breathing issues, asking people not to kiss her is reasonable, and it makes sense that you would be angry. \n\nEven though your daughter is older now, this woman's lack of common sense and refusal to do what you asked her would make me not trust her with my child.", "The AH in this is your husband's cousin.

After all, she kissed your baby while you were holding her.  You definitely should not let her come to house any longer.

A baby has essentially NO immune system. Things that an adult with a functional immune system would shrug off with minimal or even no symptoms can land an infant in the hospital. Or a grave.\n\nYeah, even 20 or 30 years ago, the advice wasn't so extreme. Medical knowledge is always increasing. That leads to changes in standards. Sometimes rules are relaxed (see AIDS timeline, for example), sometimes they are tightened up.\n\nSince she obviously thinks she knows more than today's medical professionals, I would ban her entirely, along with anyone advocating for her.

I also make everyone ask the babies for hugs and kisses. They hate that, too\nSTAND FIRM in your boundaries, Mama.", "NTA - Your child. Your rules. Plain and simple. \n\nYou get to decide what rules you have with your kids and other people have to respect them. If they don't, cut them out of your life.

How dare she disregard your and husband\u2019s request on what is good for your infant.

Kissing babies when their immune systems are still basically non-existent is dangerous enough as it is, but kissing a ***preemie*** is 10000000000% times more dangerous!

It's your baby, and you have set these boundaries saying explicitly not to kiss her. Carol is the AH for crossing those very reasonable boundaries", "Honestly, refusing to let her hold the baby is not enough considering what your child has already gone through.

That\u2019s not your child. Parents make decisions about baby, end of. \n\nBut to further complicate it by ignoring the wishes of the parents of a *premature baby*, who, like you said, already is more susceptible to illness\u2026 Cousin Carol needs to keep her cooties to herself.

It is your child. \n\nBut for clarification, it looks like your daughter is now 2? So her inmune system must be much stronger now. I really get that what happened was really scary (I also had a premature) but please don't let the conditions in which she was born become a life sentence.", "I live with my in laws it's not my house", "A lot of the family keep saying I'm an asshole and should just lighten up and stop being a helicopter parent", "NTA doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a doctors rule or a parents rule. If I\u2019m establishing a boundary with my child who can not advocate for themselves and you decide to violate that boundary, that\u2019s it.

OP does a thing, someone tells OP they are an AH for doing that thing, OP comes here to find out if they are indeed an AH. It doesn't need to be the other person directly involved in the issue who thinks OP is an AH in order to come here looking for judgment.", "I have no solid proof but husband and I think she went running her mouth like she does on everything else and since most of them work at the hospital they think they know better than us", "I didn\u2019t mean to reply to you sorry but I don\u2019t think OP is AH for establishing boundaries for her child. Kids get herpes and other communicable diseases from people who can\u2019t keep their nasty mouth from themselves. Add this baby\u2019s condition to it. The problem is you people feel entitled to other people\u2019s kids and that is absolutely weird and you should really go see someone about it.", "So?  She wasn\u2019t obligated to keep it a secret that you said you didn\u2019t want her to hold your child.", "I don't. I clearly stated that the parents' boundaries are to be respected.", "But she's framing it as OP being an ass rather than OP doing the only sensible thing in this situation, which is protecting a vulnerable child. The cousin is still a shitty person and the asshole in this situation for making OP's life difficult for no reason."]}
