You\u2019re now being punished for \u201clying.\u201d There was no way to truly win in this situation, so you made the right call by doing what was best for you.\n\n1. Your sexuality is none of their goddamned business. You don\u2019t owe anyone information about your sex life. Keeping the information to yourself was not a lie, it was a facet of your right to privacy.\n\n2. Plenty of LGBTQIA people don\u2019t come out until they are in a place of safety and security. Everyone should be understanding of that choice. No one who cares about you should expect you to casually accept being disowned or brutalized because of your orientation. You were at a disadvantage due to an inescapable power dynamic. You were dependent upon these people due to your age. You omitted things about your life until you could support yourself. That was a practical decision meant to counteract an imbalance of power, not a reflection of your character or commitment to social justice. \n\n3. Operating under the assumption that you never joined in their homophobic rhetoric or displays, your family\u2019s assumptions are not your responsibility. Who cares if they thought you were homophobic too? You didn\u2019t perpetuate their ideology. You didn\u2019t inflict harm on a community by acting against them. You merely kept silent - at that time - out of self-preservation. People should stand up for what\u2019s right, but it\u2019s not fair to expect everyone to stand up for everything at every time and place. You were a child and then a vulnerable young adult. Challenging your family\u2019s homophobia would have provided very little benefit to anyone while actively harming you. Your friends seem very happy to risk your welfare for their ideals. I wonder how willing they would be to risk their welfare for their ideals at your age and in your situation. I doubt they\u2019d all sack up for a display of solidarity that offered little benefit and came with an enormous personal fallout. I think you\u2019d discover that most of them are hypocrites. \n\nWith that being said, you are now a young adult in a much better position. Take your freedom and your future in your own hands. Build a life where you can be yourself, but also where you have the means to advocate for others. Have the compassion for struggling youth that your friends failed to show you. Give them the support that your family chose to withhold.", ">I am not going to lie. I wasn't celibate during university.
