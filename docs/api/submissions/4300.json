You\u2019re now being punished for \u201clying.\u201d There was no way to truly win in this situation, so you made the right call by doing what was best for you.\n\n1. Your sexuality is none of their goddamned business. You don\u2019t owe anyone information about your sex life. Keeping the information to yourself was not a lie, it was a facet of your right to privacy.\n\n2. Plenty of LGBTQIA people don\u2019t come out until they are in a place of safety and security. Everyone should be understanding of that choice. No one who cares about you should expect you to casually accept being disowned or brutalized because of your orientation. You were at a disadvantage due to an inescapable power dynamic. You were dependent upon these people due to your age. You omitted things about your life until you could support yourself. That was a practical decision meant to counteract an imbalance of power, not a reflection of your character or commitment to social justice. \n\n3. Operating under the assumption that you never joined in their homophobic rhetoric or displays, your family\u2019s assumptions are not your responsibility. Who cares if they thought you were homophobic too? You didn\u2019t perpetuate their ideology. You didn\u2019t inflict harm on a community by acting against them. You merely kept silent - at that time - out of self-preservation. People should stand up for what\u2019s right, but it\u2019s not fair to expect everyone to stand up for everything at every time and place. You were a child and then a vulnerable young adult. Challenging your family\u2019s homophobia would have provided very little benefit to anyone while actively harming you. Your friends seem very happy to risk your welfare for their ideals. I wonder how willing they would be to risk their welfare for their ideals at your age and in your situation. I doubt they\u2019d all sack up for a display of solidarity that offered little benefit and came with an enormous personal fallout. I think you\u2019d discover that most of them are hypocrites. \n\nWith that being said, you are now a young adult in a much better position. Take your freedom and your future in your own hands. Build a life where you can be yourself, but also where you have the means to advocate for others. Have the compassion for struggling youth that your friends failed to show you.

If that's what it takes for them to be happy, people should be able to accept that and be happy for them.", "NTA... If you have bigots for grandparents, and you KNOW they would shut you out for being you? Then, I am with you. You should not be punished for who you are. I applaud the fact that you were able to make it through school without your grandparents finding out, but I am so incredibly sorry that it was ever an issue. You should never have had to hide who you are and especially with your own family.", "NTA. You don't owe anybody information about your sexuality.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t sign a contract or have a verbal agreement that your grandparents paying for college is contingent on you being straight, so if they went the legal route, I think you\u2019re fine. \n\nIn any case, have a happy, unapologetic gay life.", "I like how your family thinks keeping who you like to fuck to yourself is lying.

They will hopefully grow out of this, as they gain more experience in life and continue to grow into adults. Only you know your family, only you know how they behaved towards your cousin *and* you. Only you know what path you can cope with in responding to difficulty. This is one of those things that crops up over and over again - very few of us will never have a broken love affair, be bullied or laid off at work, a family member with mental or physical illness, etc.  But we each have different coping styles or limits. \n\nI grew up seeing my second cousin constantly whispered about because she was a lesbian. Most of her life was never shared with the rest of us because of the bigotry of my mother's family, and that's such a tragedy. Who she loved was just one part of the person she was. My mother was vile, but presenting herself differently to the outside world. Deciding how to deal with her was different than what some of my friends with abusive families, or my older siblings, decided to do. I had a friend who decided to live on the street rather than with her violent father, and two of my siblings relied financially on my parents much longer than I did. \n\nWhen you've been abused or are rejected for being who you are, you often have a threatened self-image. Other people's choices can feel very threatening to you because unconsciously you're still trying to justify your own choices. That's why your friends are so upset you didn't do what they did. So, while I think your friends are being a bit assholish, too, I've been there (on both sides), and I hope they grow out of it sooner rather than later.", "NTA why shouldn't you lie?
