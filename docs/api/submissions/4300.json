You\u2019re now being punished for \u201clying.\u201d There was no way to truly win in this situation, so you made the right call by doing what was best for you.\n\n1. Your sexuality is none of their goddamned business. You don\u2019t owe anyone information about your sex life. Keeping the information to yourself was not a lie, it was a facet of your right to privacy.\n\n2. Plenty of LGBTQIA people don\u2019t come out until they are in a place of safety and security. Everyone should be understanding of that choice. No one who cares about you should expect you to casually accept being disowned or brutalized because of your orientation. You were at a disadvantage due to an inescapable power dynamic. You were dependent upon these people due to your age. You omitted things about your life until you could support yourself. That was a practical decision meant to counteract an imbalance of power, not a reflection of your character or commitment to social justice. \n\n3. Operating under the assumption that you never joined in their homophobic rhetoric or displays, your family\u2019s assumptions are not your responsibility. Who cares if they thought you were homophobic too? You didn\u2019t perpetuate their ideology. You didn\u2019t inflict harm on a community by acting against them. You merely kept silent - at that time - out of self-preservation. People should stand up for what\u2019s right, but it\u2019s not fair to expect everyone to stand up for everything at every time and place. You were a child and then a vulnerable young adult. Challenging your family\u2019s homophobia would have provided very little benefit to anyone while actively harming you. Your friends seem very happy to risk your welfare for their ideals. I wonder how willing they would be to risk their welfare for their ideals at your age and in your situation. I doubt they\u2019d all sack up for a display of solidarity that offered little benefit and came with an enormous personal fallout. I think you\u2019d discover that most of them are hypocrites. \n\nWith that being said, you are now a young adult in a much better position. Take your freedom and your future in your own hands. Build a life where you can be yourself, but also where you have the means to advocate for others. Have the compassion for struggling youth that your friends failed to show you.

You wisely withheld information that would have screwed you. Bigots don\u2019t get sympathy, period. You got yours. Fuck em and live your truth", " NTA", "NTA.  Your private life is just that\u2026private.  And if you really didn\u2019t say anything, how did you lie?  Move on, go no contact and be happy to have them out of your life.", "NTA", "NTA This isn't lying, it's being discreet. Knowing you would be cut off because of your orientation doesn't reflect well on your family. If your dad feels that bad about it he can pay the grands back.", "Nta\n\nIf you were my child I would tell you to lie. I would tell you to be so damn careful. You did the right thing. You are not any less deserving but you need to cut all those mofos out of your life", "NTA also deny deny deny. I don't care who was trusted. Just tell everyone you don't know what they're talking about. Or say they came in to you. And if you didn't sleep with them they will lie and out you as gay. Lol", "NTA. They should treat their grand kids lovingly and equally. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re homophobic and keep being you! Way to get that education loan free. I hope you and your cousin can build a found family of sorts over time.", "NTA. You didn't lie. You just didn't give them information about something that was none of their business!", "NTA. But hateful family are.", "NTA\u2026 but your homophobic family is. Glad you got your degree!!!", "NTA I love picturing their faces when they found out they'd paid for a Gays education.

Enjoy your degree.", "In the words of Brian Kinney,  \"It's not lying if they make you lie\"", "NTA let them try and explain the situation in court if they feel wronged.", "So, because you are gay you do not have the right to an education? I don't really know how that works in their minds.... Anyway, they set themselves up for deceit. So, I don't think you are wrong, you did what you had to do for a good reason. I don't quite understand why your friends are turning on you though. Are they homophobic too?", "NTA\n\n\nFuck decrepit homophobes", "Did your grandparents make you sign a contract saying they were only paying for college as long as you were heterosexual? No? Then they (and your parents) can peace out with the idea of you paying them back because they now know you aren\u2019t heterosexual. Let them try to sue you for it without any written contract stating this kind of restriction. \n\nIt was a gift; they can\u2019t take back a gift once given. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "LMAO nope, NTA, not even a little bit.\n\nThey have no place being angry at you for \"lying\" - it was their own assumption you were straight by default that did all the work. Of course, even if you'd lied through your teeth that you were totes the straightest straight to ever walk a straight line, I'd say NTA because lying for your own safety in a bigoted household is A-okay by me, but you didn't even do that. You just carried on your merry gay way without informing them about your romantic life. People who flip out when their bigoted assumptions about others are corrected should not act shocked when other choose not to correct their bigoted assumptions. I'm sorry you were forcibly outed to them, but I'm very glad it didn't happen when they still had power over you. Now you have the option to wash your hands of them and their BS, and keep living your life debt free.\n\nSo good luck in your bright future, and mad props for pulling one over on those decrepit homophobes! \ud83c\udfc6", "NTA.\nFuck \u2018em for being a bunch of homophobes.

I had a.friend in college who was in the same position.

I had a dorm mate whose parents forced him into a conversion camp as a teen and he was horrifically abused.", "NTA you just need better friends.", "NTA. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but yours who you sleep with and you have ZERO obligation to come out to people who are willing to hurt you (physically or emotionally).

All the best for your future.", "I don't think keeping your sexuality to yourself is \"lying\". It is a private thing and so long as they didn't outright ask you about it then you didn't lie. It's sad that your family can't support and love you no matter what. Congrats on your degree. NTA", "You never lied. They made assumptions. NTA. Block them on everything.

You intentionally deceived them in order to use their money, that makes you a raging asshole", "Agree. I\u2019m 100% a proponent of coming out and being out\u2026 when one is a financially independent adult. \n\nWe don\u2019t need to win our freedom on the backs of kids who were thrown out by their families. Queer adults who feel otherwise are morally bankrupt. Many of us who are Gen X and older did get thrown out and we see it as an almost normal part of the subculture. But it\u2019s not normal or okay and kids with homophobic families should look out for their own safety first and come out when it\u2019s safe to do so. \n\nStraight adults who suggest that queer youth come out and face danger or serious financial penalty because \u201clying is wrong\u201d are actually homophobes. OP\u2019s bigoted dad can fuck right off. \n\nThere are many ways of throwing out your kid. Making them live on the street is the most extreme but there are other manifestations of this kind of hatefulness. Refusing to pay for a queer child\u2019s higher education (for reasons of homophobia) is also throwing out your kid and it\u2019s gross.\n\nNTA.", "I think being in that actual situation I can see why OP feels bad cuz any decent person would feel bad for lying but OP shouldn't cuz in the grand scheme of things the grandparents are so much worse.

For that reason, (s)he is NTA.", "Exactly. There\u2019s been a few times where I had to \u201cblend\u201d because that was the only safe option for me at the time. \n\nI have an aunt who didn\u2019t think homophobia was a real thing (you can probably guess, but yes she was homophobic herself.)

There'd be no need for anyone to pass if the alternative wasn't facing vitriolic hatred and violence constantly. If someone has the option to avoid that long enough to survive and get to a better place, no one should fault them for it.", "No. Don't believe this bs.\n\nYou owe a coming out to no one. And it's unsafe to come out to known homophobes. It's especially unsafe to come out when you're still financially insecure. \n\nTell the grandparents and any other shitty family members that they must earn full disclosure by proving that they can be trusted to treat you in a loving and fair way with the info they already stole from you.

Let me guess everyone that disagrees with you is also a fascist. \n\n\n He was not truthful, he lied. It's that simple. \n\nThe money was not meant for him regardless of how you feel.
