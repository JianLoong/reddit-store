Is there a way to navigate this situation without it feeling like I'm in a sitcom? Trying hard to figure this one out... I'm not going to lie..., I feel like a very egalitarian person but this has be questioning if I'm in the wrong here.\n\n\\*\\*\\*edit: a few have mentioned the unclear importance of her being trans.

It's very presumptuous for someone who recently married the father of adult children to suddenly demand that they call her mom.

That said, her emotions around this are not more important than yours and you have every right to set this boundary. It simply is not reasonable for her to expect adult children to call her mom just because she\u2019s married their father. \n\nHowever, it sounds like you genuinely like her and otherwise have a good relationship with her. Is she (or has she been) in therapy during her transition or otherwise? Perhaps let her know that you\u2019d like to resolve this, but feel the help of a therapist might be helpful for everyone involved. You could go to family therapy or suggest she talk with a therapist about this issue first, then you join for a session later. But gently let her know that this behaviour can\u2019t continue and expecting you to trample your boundary isn\u2019t fair to you.

Stepmom is just another adult entering your life - you may like her, you may be grateful to her for making your dad happy, you may even grow to love her, but she will never be your \u201cmom.\u201d  No matter how much she cries.

For instance they don\u2019t call their stepdad, dad when talking to me, they use his name. But I do call him my uncle, since I never really had a relationship with their actual Dad when I was growing up. \n\nI can tell this has nothing to do with her being transgendered from your post.

You're not calling any stepmother mom because that's reserved for your bio mom and because you're a grown ass person and I personally find it weird you're calling her mom as an adult when you didn't have her as a mom growing up. If she raised you since you were a kid, sure. But that's not this relationship.", "NTA. you not calling her mom has nothing to do with her being trans and everything to do with her being your *step*mom, not your mom. she needs to realize that.", "Yes, which as you will notice if you actually read what I wrote, is supported by what I wrote.", "bingo.", "If you don\u2019t have the political or social capital to broach therapy with her, then it\u2019s all the more extreme that she\u2019s so upset you\u2019re not giving her this title.

This has nothing to do with anything but who you call mom. Which would be your mom. If you explain it to them that way, perhaps they (dad and her) will understand. ~~Maybe you can come up with a name like Momma X that is comfortable for everyone.~~\n\nEDIT - On 2nd thought, forget about coming up with a maternal name (x'd out sentence). I am not sure there is a compromise here.", "You said big family talk. I mean a one on one. You and her. The pressure of the whole family being there could be a lot.

Thanks for pointing it out.\n\nOn the other hand, that's her issue, not OP's.

It's a social context - if this person walks like a woman, talks like a woman, acts like a woman, dresses like a woman...etc. then isn't it far more appropriate socially to accept her as a woman rather than continue to socially label her as a man, even if some of her characteristics don't quite match up for you, especially given how incredibly broad the categories of \"talk like a woman,\" \"act like a woman,\" \"dresses like a woman...etc\" are these days?", "Ah, I see!

Forcing people to call her 'Mom', is not healthy.\n\nTell her that it will not be happening, you have a mother who has that title and it's not one you're about to share with anyone else.\n\nIf she wants to play happy families, she can get a dog and dress it up in cute outfits.", "I\u2019m sorry you got shade over that, it was pretty fucking obvious to me.", "*mikaela ;)", "I think you're picking a side here. Which is fine but I'm definitely not comfortable with that. I just feel like this is unreasonable. My mom did all the work and was with me from the day I was born.

This was my main concern. I never want anybody to feel that way.", "Much appreciated!", "Whoops!! Corrected!!", "I actually agree with you in not calling her a maternal name but was trying to figure out  way to make her comfortable. I always think its a bit much when a stepmom or stepdad want to be called mom or dad. It comes off as insecure. I have a feeling she will not be happy with anything besides a maternal name. Good luck, OP, this whole thing seems completely overblown.", ">I just think there are relevant ulterior motives bending towards gender affirmation and validation.\n\nReading between the lines, I think so too. Does she have children of her own from a previous marriage? I feel like this individual so desperately wants the title \"mom\" because it embodies female-ness. But calling it something doesn't make it so; she is not your mom. (I called my step-mother by her first name, myself). And it's not your job to validate her femininity - that is her issue to deal with and not yours. You can call her by her preferred pronouns and accept who she is and love her as part of the family but she has no right to ask you to sacrifice what you hold dear (ie reserving the special title \"mom\" for your actual mom) just so that she can feel more female.", "Yeah, I know. Was bad advice. Just trying to figure out a way to make everyone content. I will edit.", "I mean maybe you\u2019re repeating yourself but finding new ways and kind ways (not saying you haven\u2019t been kind so far just to continue so) she may relate to better to get your point finally. Otherwise maybe she just needs some time to think on her own about why it may be an issue for you, if you have made your point clear already. Sometimes people just need that lightbulb moment and badgering someone into doing something is gonna work only like 1% of the time", "Ok this explains things better because I, too, was wondering what her being trans had to do with anything. So if it's clearly a big part of this then you should be blunt. Tell her that you cannot call her Mom because you already have one, however, if calling her by her name is going to upset her is there some other name you and she can think of together that will make her feel warm, happy, and accepted by you? Be reassuring that you want to show her respect, but that just as she has certain boundaries you have some as well and reserving 'mom' for your mom is one of them. Have you considered something close but not? Like mum, mumsie, mother, ma, mater familias? Do either of you have a connection to another language or culture you can borrow from? Maman, mere, mutti. I know you might find this situation non-comedically sitcom-y, but don't give up trying to find a middle ground that works for you both.

How is the fact that she probably doesn\u2019t see this as a bigotry thing when it isn\u2019t a bigotry thing a problem?", "Welcome to reddit lol. Gotta be outraged about something! \n\nIt's not easy being trans and frankly, I wouldn't wish it upon any one. Clearly your stepmother has some issues to work on, but unfortunately, she has to do that alone to be at peace with herself.\n\nInsisting that her husband's children refer to her as 'mom', is plain weird. Unless it's a cultural thing  but I find that unlikely.\n\nYou could offer to go to a therapy session with her to clearly explain why you find this upsetting, but either way, she needs to accept your decision.", "Its just one of those situations where its not possible for both sides to be content unfortunately.
