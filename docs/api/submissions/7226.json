This Wednesday a new roommate moved in. She is a woman in her 20s, a single mom to an adorable 5 years old daughter.\n\nI have never met this woman before she moved in, she was brought in by our landlord, we had a 10 minutes convo Wednesday before I went to work (I work night shift).\n\nYesterday she woke me up at 7am (I got home at 3), she told me that she had to go to work, but that her daughter is in bed and if I would keep an eye on her. I was sleep deprived that by the time I was about to say no she had already left.\n\nAm I crazy or is it very dangerous to leave a 5 years old girl with a strange man? I am a good person, but she didn\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t even think I would be able to leave a kid with someone I knew for weeks, let alone minutes.\n\nHer kid is well taken care of, she is happy, they cuddled after her mom got from work, she read her a story, played with her and all, that\u2019s why I am hesitating.\n\nOh and she apologized for dumping her on me, apparently she wasn\u2019t even supposed to go to work, but there was an emergency.\n\nSo WIBTA if I called CPS on her?\n\nEdit: forgot to say, I have no problem with watching the kid, I actually love children, my issue is just with her mom not knowing me, not for watching the kid.\n\n**SINCE PEOPLE SEEM TO JUST IGNORE IT, MY ISSUE IS NOT WITH BEING LEFT TO CARE FOR THE KID, MY ISSUR IS WITH THE MOTHER BASICALLY LEAVING HER KID WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER**", "created_utc": 1673622792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10awwml/wibta_for_reporting_my_roommate_to_cps/", "score": 3743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In theory, if they had unlimited resources, they\u2019d come and just chat with mom. But no, no one would do anything. So YTA kind of, but I also know they likely wouldn\u2019t even screen in your call.\n\nYou can however call CPS if you babysit the child and mom says she\u2019ll be back at 6pm and it\u2019s now 7am and you can\u2019t get ahold of mom at all- in many regions that is considered child abandonment.\n\n**Edit:** I understand peoples shock and confusion here. In my region, this is not abandonment because OP was willing to care for the child, the child was unharmed, and mom came home. It is not smart or particularly safe and moral to leave your child like this BUT, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically illegal. A CPS worker can know/feel this isn\u2019t a great situation, they may wish they could assist, but they are bound by their local LAWS and regulations- they cannot just bust down a door and apprehend/forcibly intervene unless the situation meets certain criteria. \n\nI assure you all I have seen many, many dicey cases where I knew something bad would likely happen in the future, but I *legally could not intervene nor force parents to work with me*. If you are concerned about this kind of stuff, please show up for local elections and make it a priority to better fund social services. OP\u2019s situation could benefit from a social worker checking in with mom and helping her plan and access resources. But guess what? CPS does not have the manpower to fully and adequately investigate life and death cases, let alone \u201cquestionable but surviveable\u201d cases. If you think we need more social supports out there, then make some noise and vote for it.", "NTA but don't call CPS, they won't do anything with this, but tell her that under no circumstances are you taking responsibility for her daughter and she needs to find other arrangements. this is nuts, the fact that she treated you like a stand in husband on your second day of being roommates is...concerning. set your boundaries NOW.", "I wouldn\u2019t call CPS.  They likely won\u2019t do anything to her anyway.   \n\nSide note-  I absolutely would not watch her child voluntarily until you know her better.  She could easily have a few screws loose and claim you SA\u2019d her daughter in the future.", "NTA. But consider a conversation first because the second time this happens is the time to call. There are absolutely ZERO work emergencies that I could have that would warrant leaving my 5 yo child alone with a strange man that I had met literally hours before. Especially when you work odd hours and did not agree to anything. This is so scary. Horrible parenting. And I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re now the de facto free babysitter. Nip this now.", "I think you *might* have had a case had you called CPS *at the time.*  \"I woke up to find my roommate had left her five-year-old alone with me. Now I have to leave for work, she's not home yet, and I don't even have her phone number.\"\n\nBut a day later, after she had gotten home, and you delivered her child safely to her? YTA for \"reporting\" her. The kid was safe; CPS isn't going to care how carefully a parent vets their babysitter, if the kid turns out to have been safe all along. \n\nYou do need to have a discussion with your roommate about this, though, and tell her it's unacceptable.", "WTF?  How long did she leave her with you?  How did she know you didn\u2019t have to go to work?  Did she leave a way to contact her?

Her and her kid are strangers. You don't even have her number, I'm guessing? You don't know the kid, the kid doesn't know you. You know nothing about school, allergies or medical issues. \n\nThis IS abandonment. If this happens again, contact the landlord, tell him the woman and her kid are not a good fit in the house, and have them call the woman and call the cops. You should have a record of this, in case anything happens, to cover your ass. \n\nAnd the poor kid is being left alone with a stranger, who could be a creep, could have a criminal record of some kind, could be on drugs, and outside of that, has nothing whatsoever to do with this kid.\n\nEdit: I read some of your comments. She was gone for 12 hours and you didn't know her name? Yeah no, that is abandonment. She's gonna pull this crap with every roommate. Definitely contact your landlord, make the report, and make it clear you will not babysit again. If she does leave the kid again, call the cops. You'll need official evidence.", "The situation needs to be addressed but I\u2019m not sure if it is worthy of calling CPS", "I think you'd be NTA but it also might be in your best interest to have a conversation beforehand. If it *really* was an emergency and not something that'll happen again it could be moved past. The issue with calling cps over this is that if she is actually a good mother, you're separating a child from their mother for no good reason, and thats potentially a lot worse than asking her new roommate to watch the kid for a few hours", "What she did was messed up, but I wouldn't report her to CPS just yet.  Hopefully this really was just a one time thing and a terrible lapse in judgement that will never happen again.\n\nQuestion...How long did she leave her daughter with you?", "You could call CPS and at most they will do a visit and see that the daughter is well taken care of and leave. AND the mom will probably. Have beef with you.\n\nFor the most part, she did nothing wrong. She knew where you lived and how to find you if anything happened. Work called her in and in order to keep good standing with her job (to continue providing for her daughter) she chose to trust her roommate. Yes she barely knew you, but it's the same with babysitters or nanny's. You don't get a chance to develop a deep relationship with them before trusting them with your child.\n\nWhile I'm not sure calling would make you an AH, it would make you.... Overzealous, and possibly cause issues between you and your new loving mother of a roommate. Maybe just talk with her and ask her a)why she chose to trust you and b) if she does that regularly.", "INFO: Have you spoken to her about what came up?", "I agree that what the mom did is very dangerous and shows a lack of awareness of the dangers her daughter could be in being cared for by strangers. Unfortunately, CPS probably won\u2019t be able to do anything. I am a teacher and we report unsafe situations all the time and CPS is rarely able to intervene. If this girl is fed, warm and cared for then I\u2019d have a conversation with the mom about the safety risks and set boundaries about when you\u2019re not available to watch the daughter. NTA but don\u2019t call CPS.", "You are right to think the mums behaviour is very, very ill-advised and - had you been a different sort of man to who you are - very dangerous for her daughter.\n\nBut is negligence like this a pattern? It doesn't need to be a repeated behaviour for you to feel uncomfortable about it but.... like, what would there be for CPS to investigate if this was a once off, or very rare, lapse of judgement? You call them and say 'A woman who I live with left her kid with me, and she didn't really know me well enough to trust me, nothing happened, but it could have, but it didn't. Can you send someone over right away?.' CPS workers can't do much with this - and Id say it would make you a soft YTA for calling in the big guns so early.\n\nOne thing is for certain though. You should not agree to mind the kid again. When you don't know the kid and mum at all, the danger cuts both ways. You are equally at risk.  If mum asks you to mind again, and you say 'no, I'm not comfortable with this' - and she leaves anyway? Then I'd call who you need to call.", "NTA - But I would not jump right to calling CPS. Have a conversation with her and set some ground rules. Rule 1 should be that you are not going to provide child care ever again. This is a complete stranger and child care is not included in her rent. There is no way to compromise on this without you eventually being taken advantage of.", "I get you are concerned, but there is generally two types of people who live their kid with someone they don't know, people who don't care and people who are desperate.\n \nIf she seems like a generally a good parent I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, especially considering she apologised. Realistically she's decided you are a certain level of safe because she moved in with you, and that will have factored  into her decision. She didn't come across you on the street, you're in her home.", "NTA....but I'd definitely talk to her first.  I'm a mom of a beautiful now, 25 yr old girl.  I'd NEVER  in my life leave my child with anyone I didn't know!  I've actually taken my daughter with me to work more than once when I was a single mom.  I was lucky to have a job that was like a big family and they allowed us to bring our kid to work if something came up.  She may not be in that same situation.  Please go talk to her before you call CPS.  Once that call is made there is no undoing that but I do understand your concern.", "NTA but calling right now is only going to cause tension between you two because since this is the first time then they are most likely not going to do anything. Talk to her or send her a text explaining that you are in no way responsible for her daugther and that the next time this happens without your explicit consent you will call the authorities for child abbandonment.  \n\n\nIf this happens again then you should send her a text (you are gonna need a pappertrail) saying that you did not agree to babysit and that she has X amount of time to get back or you will call the police/CPS.", "You can call the cops but they aren\u2019t gonna do shit. I use to work with CPS and they need to visibly see damage before they do shit.", "YWBTA because she lives with you.  In all honesty, if you're a bad man, you'll find an opportunity to try something with her daughter whether you babysit or not.  Essentially, what you're saying is she's a unfit parent because she can't afford her own place.  \n\nShe's a single mom, doing her thing with a 5 yo as best she can.  Chances are good she can barely afford the childcare she has, let alone emergency care.  And I would also bet that as a single parent, she feels the tenuousness of turning down a shift emergency quite clearly.  \n\nWhat is CPS going to do?  Do you WANT them to take her child away and put her in foster care?  CPS already can't pay their workers or give them a feasible workload, so I hope you don't think they'll pay for her child care.  Seriously, what outcome do you want from this?", "YWBTA. By that logic you should call CPS just because she was willing to LIVE with a complete stranger. Have a discussion about boundaries before you have a child removed from what you describe yourself as a good parent.", "NTA even if it was only 1 time. But the time to do that was while she was out of the building. Now she\u2019s back, you should have a serious conversation about her behaviour. It might have been an emergency for work, but that\u2019s not the same as an actual emergency. If someone was bleeding or on fire, leaving a child with a likely trustworthy stranger might, on balance of risks, be the best option. But that isn\u2019t what happened. And you didn\u2019t have time to answer her, she didn\u2019t ask or wait for your acknowledgement, you might have been leaving yourself at 8am, what would have happened to the child then?!", "NTA she abandoned her child with a complete stranger. Tell her if it ever happens again you will call the authorities there will be no phone calls as warning there will only be a call to cps. \n\nYou did not sign on to be her child care just because she moved into an apartment you live in.", "NTA except I would advise you to talk to her before going nuclear. I am flummoxed by the YTA votes. You regularly see people posting on here who have had siblings kids dropped on them and then they call the police and they're generally accepted to be NTA. I don't see how this is any different.", "I already made my judgement, but I\u2019m curious what all those Y W B T A people would think if this was currently happening - as in, the woman had dumped her kid with this guy an hour ago and he was still watching her.  Would he then be allowed to call CPS or the cops?  What if he had his own job to get to?  Why does mom get a pass because she just happened to luck out and leave her kid with a decent guy who didn\u2019t have any pressing engagements?", "Call the landlord and get this woman's phone number first. Give her a warning that if she does not get home in 20 minutes to claim her daughter that you are calling the authorities. When/if she gets home, inform her that you will not hesitate to call the authorities for child abandonment next time.\n\nNTA", "Calling CPS is a bit extreme. Maybe just talk to the Mum.

She can't expect strangers to babysit", "ESH\n\nDon't bring CPS into it over one incident. Set your boundary that \"I am not comfortable watching your child again\" and see how it progresses. If you report her straight up you might end up with a very tense living arrangement.\n\nYou may be a stranger but she did leave the kid in the house with an adult which I suppose is better than her being alone. She's still an AH though.", "NTA TBH, I don\u2019t think she should have left her child with ANYONE she just met.", "YWBTA if you do it without expressing explicitly to the mum how dangerous this was. If mum still cannot see why this was a very stupid decision then YWNBTA for then calling CPS. Some people have no help, that time you watched her kid might have been the day she saved her job and stopped her becoming homeless and losing her kid anyway. Find out more about the situation before you call is what I say.", "YWBTA, now this is sort of a soft one because I that you have good intentions, however, I think this is a matter that can be settled within the house. She\u2019s living with you, so obviously she has some trust that you aren\u2019t going to be a nut case, but if you aren\u2019t comfortable watching the kid, then tell her that. It honestly sounds like she\u2019s doing the best she can for her little girl, and if you are willing to help then great! But if not, discuss that with her, the little girl is well loved and cared for, no need to bring CPS for this.", "ESH. She should not have left her kid with you like that, however to call cps over it youd be in the wrong over one time. If its repeatedly, its different. Whether or not they would do anything, i dont know. But what i do know is that they impact a familys life so much if they do get involved that unless it\u2019s absolutely needed then its better left without their involvement\n\nEdit: fixed a sentence", "YWBTA.\n\nI am assuming that since your landlord set you up, he/she also vouched for you, and that probably factored into her assumption that you are safe.\n\nWas it stupid?  Yes.   Irresponsible?  Yes.   But talk to her, address these points, and set boundaries now.   And make it clear that if you believe she is really putting her child at risk, you will not hesitate to report her.", "I would say ESH, but you only softly if you call CPS. It was beyond rude from her to dump her kid on you without letting you even the time to answer, but technically, you didn't refuse to care for the kid.\n\nBut calling CPS won't do a thing. She left the kid in a the custody of an adult, and you being a male doesn't change a lot. It's not illegal to leave a kid with a babysitter they don't really know.\n\nBut never hesitate to call CPS/police if you say NO and she still leave her kid with you. This is child abandonment and deserves a call to CPS.", "YWBTA if you called CPS on her.  However, you need to make it clear that you are not the last minute babysitter.  You are the roommate and you do not want to suddenly have your plans changed by her inability to find a sitter.\n\nShe needs to find someone willing to babysit on a moments notice.  There are plenty of babysitters out in the world and she can find one.  \n\n If you are willing to babysit for limited amounts of time, just tell her you will occasionally do it for no more than 2 hours with a days notice or whatever.  That way you maintain that she can depend on you for brief times but you need notice.... once you get to know them both.  Maybe after 6 months.", "This is a tough one, but I'd personally lay out your future expectations for her/tell her what she did can't happen again and work from there", "This situation is totally weird for a stranger to leave their 5 year old with another stranger for any prolonged period of time. If this has not happened again then I would just have a conversation with the mother to get to know her more and that it was awkward to be left with a child he met less than 24 hours ago. If this becomes a regular thing then I would certainly reiterate with the mother that this is not acceptable. Then if nothing changes contact the authorities. I would also be tempted to record EVERYTHING when you are with the child to CYA in case the mother starts making accusations. You never know. \n\nGood luck OP. NTA", "ESH - if you don\u2019t at least speak to her you would be. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine a situation where I would leave either of my kids with someone I hardly knew. That being said it is possible she had a very good report on you from the landlord and felt safe doing so. \n\nWhile technically it is abandonment you didn\u2019t actually tell her no, nor did you leave her unattended though it was short notice. You need to have a frank conversation with her and find out why she was ok with it. Make sure she knows any boundaries you have towards watching the kid since you seem ok with doing so and go from there. Definitely keep record in case it happens again and then I\u2019d definitely consider calling cps.", "What don't people get about this situation?\n\nThe mistake \"didn't cause harm?\" He \"agreed?\" He doesn't \"trust himself?\" What even...\n\nOP you are completely right.

They leave the kids that need to be removed with horrible parents in most cases", "YWBTA. Establish boundaries, and if there is abusive neglect ongoing you can call. But if we called CPS every time a parent had a stupid lapse of judgement then every kid in the world would be in foster care. Let's hope this is a one off for an otherwise good mom", "YWBTA  there are flags in her behavior for sure, I think the best thing is not to go nuclear out of the gate. She may have had a genuine emergency and had no choice. Check her behavior over a slightly longer period than just one example", "YTA\n\nOn this one instance? Yes YTA for calling CPS.\n\nJust bloody talk to her!", "[deleted]", "CPS doesn\u2019t just come by and take the kid, bro. There\u2019s gonna be a weeks long investigation, even if there\u2019s nothing going on. Don\u2019t do it, please consider the welfare agents that are just as overworked and underpaid as the rest of us.", "YWBTA\n\nThe reaction doesn\u2019t match what actually happened. Sounds like this was an emergency & Mom had no other choice. She obviously trusts you... she moved in with you. While I agree this was far from a great decision it may have been her only option. What exactly would you be reporting to CPS? Something that didn\u2019t happen? There are no laws that prevent parents from leaving a child with a responsible adult. You sound like a responsible adult. CPS won\u2019t care how long you have known each other because the child was safe.\n\nYou now know who you are living with... so now is the time to sit down, have a conversation & set up some very clear boundaries with understood consequences if she continues this behavior.\n\neta \u2014 1 time is understandable but this is definitely red flag behavior so if I were you I would absolutely ask if she often gets \u201cemergency\u201d work calls & would make it very clear that you are NOT going to be the babysitter. But judging a person based on one incident where nothing bad actually happened is not really fair... especially not fair to her daughter.", "YTA.\n\nI work in CPS and first of all, this isn\u2019t even anything they would look in to. It happened one time and was an emergency situation. You\u2019re her roommate and were vetted by the landlord, so she has to have some  level of trust in you by default. The child by your own admission is happy and loved and well taken care of.\n\nListen, it would be one thing if she dropped her kid off at the park or a grocery store with a stranger and then left her there for hours. Or if this was something that she does regularly because she doesn\u2019t have a plan. But this was a work emergency, and she likely had no other choice. She was probably insanely stressed out and scared of losing her job. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t want to leave her kid home alone with someone she\u2019s not close with, and was just doing the best she could while stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nShe should have left you some more information, but this is not a reportable offense.", "YWBTA\n\nWhat she did was wrong and careless, but one time doesn\u2019t warrant a call to CPS in my opinion. When she gets home have a proper conversation with her; tell her she can\u2019t just dump her child on you and if she does want childcare she needs to discuss it with you well in advance. If she doesn\u2019t do this and continues to leave the child unattended, then you can take more drastic measures.", "NTA - just talk first and say you will call CPS if this happens again because this makes you extremely uncomfortable in many ways.", "I mean, kind of. I don't agree with her having done that, but seriously? She's your roommate (so she has to have some kind of trust even if she doesn't know you), and it might have been a very serious emergency. \n\nTalk to her and make sure it doesn't happen again and tell her you think thay's concerning and have considered calling CPS and will in the future if it continues to happen.\n\nBut if you do it after it happened once? Yeah, YTA, especially considering you like kids and didn't have a problem with it (not saying it's okay to dump her child on you because of that though, don't get me wrong)", "YTA does not begin to cover it if you call CPS right *now.* \n\nYou need to have a serious conversation and make clear that she cannot expect to be able to dump her daughter on you, that you are not a stand-in partner while she is single, perhaps even that you WILL call the authorities if she does it again, etc. \n\nBut CPS can completely destroy someone's life. It can permanently traumatize both children and parents. It sounds like she may have gotten a little too used to doing this with some other roommate(s).\n\nThe basically decent thing to do is have that conversation and see how she reacts: by doing it again and basically daring you to call, or takes it seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, what she did was wildly inappropriate. The consequences you'd bring down on her out of spite would dwarf her own act.", "If it realy is a one time thing, then yes ytah, If it becomes a regular thin try talking to her before calling cps", "YTA - CPS is a very serious call to make.

What are you going to tell CPS? \"This woman asked me to babysit her kid but I might be a serial killer?\"", "NTAY but you WILL be the Asshole if you do call. What she did was not ok. At all. As a parent this infuriates and concerns me. BUT...I don't know her situation. Further, CPS is the absolute last venue anyone should have to deal with. They are understaffed, quick to judge and it is next to impossible to be redeemed and have them leave you alone. \n  \n  \nYou're getting a lot of comments saying similar things but you are replying with your justifications. I'm going to say that there are no justifications for calling CPS for this at this point. Talk to her. Tell her how absolutely insane and not ok it was and how you feel it put you into a moral dilemma. But the moment you call CPS for this instance? You're the absolute asshole.", "NTA at this point I don\u2019t know what you would say to CPS, she asked you if you would watch the kid, you said yes. You guys live in the same apartment it\u2019s not like she saw a dude on the corner and left her kid with him, even though it kind of is because you don\u2019t know each other. My point is that I don\u2019t think CPS would care about this because you said you would watch the kid. If she asked you and you said no and she left the child or if you just woke up and the child was alone then yes you must call CPS\n\nAnd because it sounds like you will probably have to call CPS at some point on this woman I just want to tell you that some states are mandatory reporting states, that means everyone is a mandatory reporter, which means if you suspect child abuse and neglect and you do not report it you are guilty of a misdemeanor crime. Furthermore, in the state that I live in, if there are housemates in a child abuse situation who do not intervene they have been charged with abuse and neglect as well, I don\u2019t know if they actually end up getting convicted, but you don\u2019t want to be involved in anything like that even just as a person listed as a cohabitate are for this girl. \n\nYou must call CPS if you see the minimum of standard of care not being given. You can make the call anonymously you just have to be careful of what you say because there will be transcripts I think her future lawyer will see like if you refer to her as your roommate she will obviously know one of her roommates called.

It would be OK to tell her not to even ask ever. It\u2019s a good idea to set out hard boundary right away so you don\u2019t feel resentful and so she doesn\u2019t pretend she thought it was OK to leave in the middle of the night with just you and her sleeping child at home.", "ESH\n\nYTA for calling CPS just over one instance.

She's too trusting of strangers. What if you decided to leave the 5 year old alone and went out for the day?  What if you were a bad person?. I do think you need to nip it out in the bud right now.

Yes, this was dangerous, your roommate doesn't know you well enough to ask you to babysit.

I was sleep deprived that by the time I was about to say no she had already left.\n\nAm I crazy or is it very dangerous to leave a 5 years old girl with a strange man? I am a good person, but she didn\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t even think I would be able to leave a kid with someone I knew for weeks, let alone minutes.\n\nHer kid is well taken care of, she is happy, they cuddled after her mom got from work, she read her a story, played with her and all, that\u2019s why I am hesitating.\n\nOh and she apologized for dumping her on me, apparently she wasn\u2019t even supposed to go to work, but there was an emergency.\n\nSo WIBTA if I called CPS on her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is very dangerous to leave a young child (especially a girl) with an unknown man. Tell her how you feel about this situation.", "I'd not call them unless it's a repeated behaviour.  I'm guessing she trusted you as you have same landlord. You would be NTA either way if yiu do decide to report it.", "I would say NAH .... For this reason....

Talk to your roommate first and let her know your concerns, that way it doesn\u2019t happen again. Edit to add: of course if there is abandonment and neglect then call them.

All the same excuses. \"It's fine, I have done it before, nothing like this ever happened before\" \n\nWhat if it isn't you next time and she leaves the kid with a not so kind deviant? Would you feel responsible for not saying anything when you knew she had a history of making bad decisions? \n\nA innocent life is at stake. YWNBTA.

Something seems missing from this story.", "So you're assuming that Reddit knows more about whether this kid should be taken from her mom than trained officials doing their job. A report is not a demand that they be separated, it is a report. If the action doesn't warrant removing the kid unless it is part of a pattern, your report becomes evidence to be combined with additional reports to determine if there is a pattern, but not on its own the reason the family would be separated. That said, she lives with you and you have the ability to see a pattern yourself now. Personally, I'd document it. Write down everything that happened. If a pattern emerges, you will have details for a future call. If not, not. People make mistakes and people have emergencies and if kids were taken from their parents for every single instance like this, good parents would lose their kids and there would be no one left who was \"qualified\" to care for them. But CPS knows that and they know of any history mom has that might make this look different from a one-time mistake as well.", "YTA yeah. Just explain to her that you weren\u2019t comfortable with her choice. Sounds like a 1-off.", "I'm sure I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but **NTA**\n\nAs someone who was SA as a very young child, I'm horrified by the fact that almost everyone here is so concerned about the mother, and not prioritising the safety of this 5-year-old child (which ironically, is what you are trying to do). Sometimes I find this sub genuinely disturbing in its skewed priorities, with everyone worried about \"mind your own business\" and \"stop shaming struggling moms\" but no one actually worried about the fact that this mom is ENDANGERING HER 5-YEAR-OLD CHILD.\n\nAnd guaranteed, if this woman didn't hesitate to leave her 5-year-old with a complete stranger, a man in his 20s whom she'd known for all of about 10 minutes before moving them in with him, then THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, and left her child with someone she barely knows. Someone who sees a guy she doesn't know in any meaningful way as a safe caretaker for her preschool-aged child is a person who has absolutely left her kid alone with other virtual strangers before \"in an emergency\" or when she \"had no choice.\" And that's the thing. There is always a choice. ALWAYS. I know mothers who would rather risk getting fired and ending up homeless than leave their small child alone with someone they know nothing about if that's the choice, because at least they know their child is safe. But THERE IS ALWAYS A CHOICE. And leaving your small child alone with a strange man is never the right one.\n\nIn this case, WE KNOW that OP wasn't dangerous, but his brand new roommate did not. She didn't know him at all. \n\nThis isn't about her taking advantage of his kindness. This is about her leaving her 5-year-old alone with a strange man with no more than a, \"She's in bed. I'll be back in several hours.\" WTF?\n\nYou should absolutely call CPS. It is doubtful that the child will be taken away, but this woman 100% needs parenting classes and to be taught how to keep her child safe. When the statistics say that \"sexual abuse most often happens from someone known to the child\" THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. It's wonderful that OP turned out not to be a predator, but it was triggering to me even to read that the mother did this, it was so incredibly unsafe. You absolutely WNBTA for calling CPS. She needs help and support to learn how to keep her child safe. Please. Before this goes terribly wrong.", "Sure just ruin her life why don\u2019t you? \n\nYWBTA", "Today is a new day. Talk to your roommate and boundaries should be established ASAP. This situation should not be repeated again. What she did was pretty dumb but calling CPS is kinda dumb now.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I understand your concern, getting CPS involved over this could be a disaster.\n\nYes, it's not a good idea to leave your 5 year old with a stranger.  But consider this - she's a single mom who got called into work unexpectedly with no time to arrange for child care.  It's likely that your landlord told her that you are a good person, with good character when she was looking for a place to live.  Otherwise, why would she move into an apartment with a 5 year old daughter with a man she doesn't know at all?  She probably felt like she could trust you under these circumstances.\n\nI think you need to have a talk with your roommate about the situation, and say that you felt uncomfortable because you hardly know them, and that going forward she needs to work out a plan in case she is called in to work last minute - you might not always be able to watch her child and the mom needs to give you a chance to tell her that.  You also need a way to contact her in case of emergency.\n\nPlease don't call CPS over one incident.  If there were a pattern of abuse or neglect, then I would say call, but this was just one incident.  Getting CPS involved can turn your roommate's life into a nightmare - constant visits, evaluations, appointments - and interfere with her job as well.\n\nIf it happens repeatedly, even after a discussion with your roommate, that's another matter.", "Put yourself in the mother's shoes.  Apparently she is a single mom and has no other alternatives.  She has to go into work or possibly lose her employment.

I would talk with her--tell her that you were uncomfortable and why but calling CPS is something you do when there is abuse. This does not rise to that level of concern.  I cannot imagine you wish to make this woman's life and her daughters' any more difficult than it is already or you would not have asked for others' opinions.", "NTA. This mom is a train wreck. Who leaves a 5 year old with a stranger? Thank God you are a good person. Mom was gone for 11 hours. What if you couldn\u2019t watch her for that long? You can\u2019t leave a 5 year old alone either. Mom will keep doing this if you don\u2019t set boundaries. Also, if you leave the child alone and something bad happens, you could end up in jail yourself. I don\u2019t think a CPS call is warranted this time but Mom needs to be told not to do leave her child like that again.", "YWBTA but I understand your concerns. You need to give informed consent when agreeing to look after a kid.\n\nTalk to her and tell her it\u2019s not acceptable to leave her kid with a complete stranger (you).

Including telling her that, if she leaves her child with you without you specifically saying at the time and every time that you are taking responsibility, that you will contact the authorities for child abandonment.  She will treat you as a permanent unpaid babysitter if you let her.", "Please don't do this. I know you are young, but you need to learn some people skills. Sit her down very matter of fact and tell her you cannot under any circumstance watch her child. If she ever tries to just leave the kid there quietly without asking you you then tell her that if she leaves, you will call the police on her. You need to give her a proper warning. She might think it isn't a big deal for you to watch the kid. You need to make her know that it is a very big deal to the point that the police (and subsequently CPS) will be called. Unless she is a complete idiot, she won't do it again.", "ESH.\n\nDid you have to undergo a background check to get your apartment? Is there a chance your landlord provided your name to your roommate so she could run a background check on you prior to moving in?\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance she did some cursory research before moving in with you. So even though she doesn\u2019t know you well and shouldn\u2019t be dumping her kid on you last minute, she may have felt comfortable enough considering people have similar interactions with babysitters before using them for the first time. \n\nCalling CPS is a wild over reaction on your part. What would you even say to them? Your roommate asked you to watch her kid for a work emergency but you feel like you don\u2019t know her well? They would investigate both you and her, find out that nothing actually happened except she was inconsiderate and you were inconvenienced and you\u2019ve wasted everyone\u2019s time and inflicted trauma on a mother and child. \n\nTalk to your roommate. Say you were put in the spot since you don\u2019t know her/her kid that well and you\u2019d like to get to know them better.

Wtf lol", "YWBTA you need to have a talk with the mother about what the hell she was thinking but CPS would be a step to far unless she continues to put her daughter in dangerous situations", "Two things can be true at the same time - 1) you can love your child 2) you can make poor choices in regards to your child. \n\nThat being said, I think a frank conversation is in order with this woman. Like you said, you\u2019re a good person, but she didn\u2019t know that. The poor judgment shown by this woman and potential danger she put her child is absolutely terrifying! She 100% needs to caller out. I think once you have a conversation with her you can make a decision if this is truly CPS worthy or if it was a one time, unfortunate mistake.", "YWBTA Why would you immediately resort to calling CPS? A good person would deal with the situation and then talk to her when she gets home. If this was a continuous problem and you defined a clear no that you won\u2019t take care of the child, that\u2019s different.\n\nOh and I\u2019m not excusing what she did. This is basically abandonment, but CPS is a bit of a stretch when you\u2019d probably be forced to continue living with her", "You should always call CPS if you think a child is in danger. It is CPS\u2019s job to decide to investigate. You can make an anonymous report. \n\nIn this case they most likely would not investigate. She did not leave her child unattended. CPS doesn\u2019t care about things that didn\u2019t happen, unless it falls under the category of neglect. \n\nIf you seen on going neglect, call CPS.

Calling CPS is a drastic move. However, I think it's good to be concerned about her dumping her child on you without knowing you but she did choose to be your roommate so she would naturally hope you're not that bad of a person. What you need to do is set boundaries on this situation. Talk to her and your landlord because you pay rent and you live there and shouldn't be used as a live in babysitter. You set a precedent by letting her do it the first time and not even calling her to let her know you weren't okay with this and she should have someone to call when these kinds of situations happen. That person should not be you.", "No please don\u2019t call CPS!", "Honestly parents leave their children with strangers all the time. Here are some examples\n\nIf we need a babysitter, and I see a flyer that the 16 year old neighbor has put on the group mailboxes, I call her and have her come over for an hour to talk to her, then proceed to allow her to babysit.. that's a stranger. \n\nI put my child in a new daycare, I've talked to the facility manager but haven't actually spoken to anyone in the daycare room, that's multiple strangers.\n\nI just gave birth, and my 15 minutes old baby is whisked away to the nursery for shots and tests to make sure everything is okay.. all of those people except for the doctor who delivered the baby... are strangers. \n\nI can see where you are coming from, not being comfortable watching a strangers child, but you YWBTA if you reported this single occurrence to CPS.

I don't think what she did was right, or smart, but if her daughter otherwise is well taken care of and safe then I'd just have a conversation with her. If she keeps doing it, I'm still not sure if CPS is the way to go, but I'm not an expert on these things. I guess you could call the cops and claim child abandonment, then CPS would likely get involved, but that's not something I would do unless things were getting out of hand. \n\nI would also consider that if your landlord placed her, he/she must have vouched for you being a good person before she moved in. I know if I were a single mom being placed with a male, I'd be asking A LOT of questions on who he is and his character. I still think it's very presumptuous for her to just leave her kid with you, a virtual stranger, but if it was a work emergency then maybe she had no other choice. Maybe she would have been fired if she didn't go in, and she couldn't afford to get fired. Have a conversation with her. Ask what her typical childcare situation is like. Let her know that while you were able to do it just that once because you didn't have time to say no, you would rather not be a childcare option in the future. \n\nFWIW, since you emphasized that your issue is not with watching her but with the fact that her mom left her with a complete stranger, I think your heart is in the right place, I just think there are other ways to go before you go the nuclear direction.", "Ex teacher here and mandated reporter. I would have called CPS and the police as soon as she walked out the door.", "NTA. She abandoned her child with a stranger. I know you said you don't have a problem baby sitting but you don't know this woman and don't know if she's going to turn around and pin something on you like SA or who knows.

What if something had happened to the kid while she was gone?\n\nPersonally I would inform her if she does that again, I'd be calling the cops for an abandoned child and leave it to the cops to decide the best course of action regarding CPS.", "YWBTA, and honestly, as far as the safety aspect is concerned, it feels weird that you would think she\u2019d have a problem asking the people she lives with if they would watch her child. Obviously, she felt the place was safe enough to move into in the first place, otherwise you\u2019re saying that moving in with you was a questionable and dangerous decision on the mom\u2019s part.\n\nNow, the way the babysitting happened is an issue and you really do need to talk to her so that it doesn\u2019t happen that way again in the future. Right now, with just one incident of her needing to go to work for an emergency and assuming that the roommate she feels safe enough to for her kid to live with would be a safe person for the kid to spend time with? I don\u2019t see it as a CPS issue. It\u2019s an interpersonal issue where boundaries need to be set for the future.

They can at least take a report. They will determine if it\u2019s necessary to call CPS. Who knows, maybe she\u2019s got a history.

However, what\u2019s to say this doesn\u2019t become a habit. What if you had had a meeting/appointment/work yourself and couldn\u2019t stay. The lack of communication and forced childcare is sooooo not cool!  I would for sure now be watching her and her parenting habits. Keep note of things that concern you with dates and times. And too, I\u2019m so sorry to say, but her leaving you alone with her child could be a sign of manipulation. If it was desperation, ok\u2026 no harm no foul, but there is the potential for her to use your gender against you if she is indeed a manipulator. Watch for things in your conversation (like her saying it was no big deal, or turning it on you and becoming upset that you may be a predator) to see how sorry she was/is for doing what she did. This is very very poor parenting. If she says sorry and strives to do better, well\u2026 most parents have done some sketchy things at times. We\u2019re human and we make mistakes.

I actually commend you for getting opinions before acting.  Try conversating with this neighbor before calling CPS.  It wasn't cool what she did but try monitoring the situation for a while.

CPS has a category where the familial decision-making process is flawed and may cause harm to the child if not corrected.

Especially if there\u2019s some sort of case for custody where ex tries to claim instability. (Mine would purposely not pick up from pre school and bus so I lost jobs having to leave mid shift. I was a GM and went back to bartending and serving because it was flexible enough and losing a job I could find another). \n\nI would just talk to her, tell her you don\u2019t mind helping but maybe you should all get to know each other first.

You can even be homeless with your child here as long as you aren\u2019t sleeping in your car because that\u2019s considered unsafe, but you could couch surf with your child as long as you\u2019re not staying in dangerous places or you could live at a homeless shelter with your child\u2019s they\u2019re not gonna take your kid just because you\u2019re poor. \n\nNot that that\u2019s the situation we\u2019re talking about here I just wanted to add that for people who get confused about what CPS should be called about.\n\nBut also standards of care and fall of education, emotion, and medical care as well.

If a kid is being constantly verbally abused That\u2019s emotional abuse that might need a phone call a lot of people don\u2019t see that because it doesn\u2019t show up in bruises but it causes trauma which can lead to mental problems and drug addiction in the future. And educational neglect needs a phone call to if you know a kid who isn\u2019t going to school and isn\u2019t being homeschooled  they need to call. Withholding education from a child is abusive and neglectful", "Thank you, former CASA, you\u2019re 100% right.

You keep saying \"Im not a bad person\" and \" i could have done anything to her\".

No, absolutely not. Is it illegal or worthy of apprehension? In most regions, no it is not. \n\nTrust me, I saw many, many dicey situations where I wished we could have intervened further, but until something actually happened to the child, we legally couldn\u2019t do a thing. CPS often operates like the police in that sense- until a crime is actually committed, they can\u2019t take any drastic measures, and since resources are so scarce, they can\u2019t even afford to take any mild measures.", "This.

Many people just aren't wealthy enough to afford any more than this. Very few people actively choose such living arrangements if they have other options.", "[removed]", "Since OP did not report in the moment and continued with watching the child that would likely be viewed as him agreeing to babysit. CPS does not in anyway regulate who a parent chooses to babysit their child. \n\nNow if a parent just leaves a child somewhere with no supervision or dumps the child with someone with no agreement for supervision, that is abandonment and CPS can get involved. OP would have needed to call *while the child was left with him*. As it is, this would be chalked up to a misunderstanding as mom asked him, he did not object, and made no attempts to contact her or CPS while watching the child. There is really no proof by his actions that he didn\u2019t agree to watch her. \n\nMom as an AH for springing this on him and probably has some poor judgment or just felt incredibly desperate and made a calculation that leaving child with OP was a better risk than losing her job and maybe ending up homeless. There is no legal standard for how well you need to know someone for them to babysit. OP was not required to babysit though and could have made attempt during that time to address the situation. He\u2019s not an AH for being concerned but his concerns do not rise to the level of concern for CPS. \n\nOP would best be served by clearly communicating to their roommate that he will not serve as a babysitter, especially without notice and discussion of safety issues.

Do you have any criminal convictions?\"\n\n\"No, of course not! She was perfectly safe; I'm a very responsible person.\"\n\n\"So what exactly is the problem? How was the child endangered?\"\n\n\"Well, the mother doesn't know me very well. She can't have known for *certain* that I was perfectly safe.

This would obviously punish the mother for being negligent but would ultimately punish the girl who could lose her mother.

And the next time (because there will be a next time) she leaves the kid at home alone with you then call the cops and cps right after she left for child abandonment telling them about the first time when you decided to stick it out and watch the kid too and telling them about you making it clear that you won't watch the kid at all ever again too.

I understand that she may be in a tough spot and really need the money, but she still needs to figure out some sort of childcare arrangement beforehand, or she *has* to tell work that she cannot come in that day. What she did was so irresponsible and no amount of money makes that okay.

She showed you who she was at seven o'clock that first morning; believe what she showed you.", "Too many people on reddit think goverment agencies are magical all powerful \"make world ideal\" entities. And too many people on reddit realize that if human organization had the amount of unchecked power they assume them to have, that power would be abused and used inappropriately all too often just due to human nature.\n\nNo, CPS does not have option to tell you that you don't know that caregiver adult enough. Nor should they have that power.", "That's a pretty narrow way of looking at it.\n\nHere's another way: Mom and child need an emergency place to stay because they are in an abusive home. (Source: OP got notice the day-of them moving in). Mom knows landlord for years, calls and asks for a place to stay. Landlord says yes, she can stay with OP who is a safe tenant he has known for years. OP is a security guard, in fact.\n\nOP goes off to work at night. Mom flees abusive house in middle of the night with daughter, moves in with OP. Mom has to testify in court the next morning, and receive a restraining order to get certain things from abusive household that day. Does not want OP to know personal business and says she has to go \"to work\" for an emergency.\n\nLandlord is around in case OP has to leave, and Mom knows this. Mom doesn't expect to take all day, but does. Mom feels bad dumping on OP, but doesn't worry about safety because Mom trusts landlord and has no other options, and doesn't want to wake up child who had a rough night.", "CPS removed me from my house as a teenager after a year of reports because we did not have a toilet. It is not for leaving your kid with your new roommate even if that is annoying or risky.", "You don't even have to go to the \"potential sex trafficker\" thing. Because, while yes it is a terrifying idea, luckily the chances of a random person being a sex trafficker are very slim. (And now that I'm thinking about it there are probably even less who would risk trafficking a kid spontaneously when it would so obviously lead back to them.)\n\nBut the chances of a random person you assign your kid to not properly taking care of them are very high! They moved in a day ago into a place without other children so no way is the whole place childproofed already, she didn't bother to check if OP had any knowledge of how to keep a kid safe, she didn't know whether he would even care to try, she also dropped this on him when he was half asleep after a night shift and could have easily just fallen asleep again without really being aware of her request, thus leaving nobody to watch the child, etc. etc. etc.", "I made another comment about this but I do wonder if she talked to the landlord and the landlord spoke very highly of you, and that\u2019s why she trusted you. Absolutely leaving kids with strangers is no go and it was really disrespectful, and she clearly doesn\u2019t have a support system with a five year old at 20. She needs a real heart to heart but she is probably doing her best. If the problem persists - like if you said you won\u2019t watch her or to let you know or ask ahead of time , or you see her leaving them with untrustworthy strangers than maybe. But even daycares can be really dangerous or again, random babysitters. My guess is the landlord spoke highly of you or she trusted you. It was very rude but yeah.", "Yes for the benefit of all involved, and first and foremost for the child. Even in the most appalling cases of neglect and abuse where it's unquestioningly necessary to remove custody/parental rights/visitation/etc from a birth parent, it's still traumatic to the child losing their parent. So yes if it's possible to keep her safe AND with mom (and or dad/other parent if they're in the picture), that's the ideal outcome. \n\nBy extension, if the best outcome for the child involves being with mom, it stands to reason we should hope for mom to also be safe, emotionally stable, supported, and generally able to get her needs met. And we should avoid wishing for punitive or extreme reactions that put her under significant stress or hardship unnecessarily. Ie, if it's possible to get her to reform this *egregious* error of judgement by having an extremely firm talk with her and landlord about child safety, boundaries, etc, that seems ideal. Just bc she did something that absolutely infuriates me and has me questioning her fitness as a mother doesn't automatically mean it's ok to just go for a scorched earth approach and assume doing so is in the child's best interest\n\nAnd lastly, best for op bc it will avoid making his living situation more hostile and dramatic than it needs to be. Which is a fair consideration that, again, would 1000% take a back seat to child safety to whatever extent those things come into conflict\n\nEdit to add: but to your point about also cuddling with your abusers, so did i. Definitely don't assume looks good from the outside = everything's fine, esp when there's such a huge red flag like this. All my abusers put on excellent public faces.", "I see what you\u2019re saying. The reality is OP can call CPS in that exact moment when mom dumps the child on him and he does not/cannot supervise. But right now, hours/days/weeks later, there is nothing for CPS to investigate- there is no crisis, no life or death emergency, no child at risk. Mom is currently at home adequately caring for the child and none of this can fall under abandonment or neglect at this time. If OP calls CPS right this moment, they will tell him it\u2019s a domestic issue and that he needs to hash it out with mom to prevent it from happening again.\n\nIf mom spontaneously leaves the child with OP tonight and he is not able to supervise, he can then call CPS in that moment. Still not a guarantee there would be assistance within 30 minutes, I can see in some jurisdictions that they wouldn\u2019t have the manpower to help and would defer to police, but generally you have to call *in the moment* OR when mom is many hours past her time to come home. If OP calls CPS every time mom leaves the child with him without his consent, at the very least CPS can build up a pattern and THEN intervene.\n\nGoing off of what OP has said, his initial post and comments I\u2019ve read thus far do not sound like CPS would do anything at this time. That doesn\u2019t mean I personally condone this or agree with CPS\u2019 regulations, just stating what typically happens in these situations.", "Yeah, people on this site really haven't seen the bad side of CPS lol. This woman is obviously struggling as a single mother, she's making dumb mistakes. But that doesn't mean separating her from her kid is what's best for the kid.", "Respectfully, I disagree. Calling CPS may be great in your area, but depending on the races/genders/sexualities of the people involved, the socioeconomic status of the people involved, the amount of bias in the department/agency, this could lead to some incredibly long lasting trauma. I used to be a social worker and worked in the DV sphere. I saw CPS used correctly, and I saw it used HORRIBLY. The system can be just of abusive as the worst homes.\n\nHowever, OP, if you ever want to check, you can call CPS, describe the situation and decline to provide any personal information. They may be able to tell you if this would be worth reporting. From what you described, I would talk to the mom first. \"Hey, I was caught off guard that you left your kid with me, especially since we don't know each other. Do you have to do that a lot?\" You may learn a lot from the conversation. You can also make your own boundaries clear here, if needed. Good luck!", "CPS can be really bad sometimes. My partner's older brother used to call CPS *all the F-ing time* when they were younger because the parents would fight for hours on end which got so bad sometimes neighbors would call the cops, most of the food in the fridge was months expired, and the kids would be locked in the back of the house for hours sometimes. Wanna know what CPS did? \n\n\nNothing, absolutely nothing.", "That makes sense.", "I hear you about the bias and absolutely agree. It\u2019s my experience (West Coast, USA) that the recent emphasis on family unification, plus oversight by guardian ad litem/court-appointed special advocates mitigate those biases.  \n\nIt sucks that OP\u2019s choices are \u201cdon\u2019t call CPS because something horrible might happen\u201d or \u201ccall CPS because something horrible might happen\u201d.  \n\nWe know nothing about OP except that they were concerned about a stranger leaving their child with them (without even waiting to see if it was ok) and we really know nothing about mom except that she left her child with a stranger. Those are the facts as they stand right now. What\u2019s the decision, given those facts? If I were OP, I\u2019d err on the side of caution and make the call.", "Legally speaking, it actually isn't, because the person did watch them. There is no factor of \"consent\" in abandonment. There is intention and actual abandonment - did the mother INTEND to abandon her child? No. Was there actual abandonment? No.\n\nIf the person did not watch the child, then it would have been actual abandonment. But ipso facto, no abandonment happened here. Maybe conspiracy or intent to abandon, but that falls out because she returned.", "And we have a winner!! \n\nSilence only helps the oppressor, never the victim! Whatever is going on, silence and ignoring it isn't going to fix it. OP has to do *something* for this little girl, and that something doesn't need to be taking the responsibility themselves. They can call DCS, they can call the landlord, but they can't just do nothing and wish later that they did.", "Who said it negates it? This explains it, it doesn't negate anything.\n\nLandlord clearly knows mother. Why didn't OP just contact landlord? something is missing here.", "OP needs to set a boundary. He will not watch the child unless he agrees to do so verbally.  If after this warning she leaves the child again without his permission, you should call the police. He is in no way responsible for this child and if something should happen to her while in his care, he would be held responsible.", "He could\u2019ve had his own plans too, or had his own emergency", "Key issue here is alone, unaccompanied.", "Yes he needs to tell her that she better have child care arrangements because he doesn't have kids. And he's not going to be responsible for anybody else's.", "The kid is five. Childproofing isn\u2019t really a huge deal at five.", "And what would the landlord do if she has a separate lease? That\u2019s a personal matter that truly has nothing to do wit the landlord", "My dad and stepmother would not let us wear clean clothes or shower for 3 days at a time when they would have us. If we got filthy on day 1, that's how we'd be until we could shower. My stepmother locked me and ny brother in a hot car one summer, and almost killed us. There are many other things, but my dad was a pharmacist, she was an RN who told us she hated kids and would write \"do not buy kids anything\" on grocery lists. Their best friends were lawyers. My mom would call repeatedly, and was always told \"We have too many abuse cases, we don't have time to look into neglect\". It took him moving into her 1 bedroom apartment (while he owned a house that he rented out for decades  but he lived there with my mom, so it was \"tainted\"), and making me and my brother rotate between the recliner and floor, that they eventally stepped in. It didn't do much, other than get a house with bedrooms for us. We are both NC, and our dad tried reaching out to us on Christmas because he has cancer.\n\nAt 41, I suffer many PTSD- related issues on top of other mental illnesses.

I\u2019m a social worker in another capacity now, but when I worked in child welfare, it was so demoralizing. Not every jurisdiction operates under the same regulations, nor does every social worker or the people who supervise them apply the regulations in the same way. Some don\u2019t recognize extreme dysfunction as a form of abuse. Some only see that the kids had food, clothing, shelter, were going to school and weren\u2019t being beaten. Never mind that the parents were extremely fucked up.  So sad.\n\nI was tasked with removing a kid once who was severely physically abused and sexually trafficked by his meth head, fucked up, Aryan Nation mom. It wasn\u2019t my case so when I get there, I was surprised to see other children in the absolutely *filthy* home. I called my supervisor and was told I was only authorized to remove the one kid! Those other children had no visible signs of physical abuse but they were absolutely terrified of their mother, even with two huge cops there. Mom was screaming racial slurs at me and the cops. There was no order for mom\u2019s arrest, just the removal of the one kid. The only way the other children could be removed was if mom was arrested. Fortunately, she spit on on of the cops and they took her. One of the little girls just clung to one of the cops when the mom was finally out of the house.\n\nI couldn\u2019t follow the case because it wasn\u2019t mine but I ran into one of the cops a few years later. He and his wife had just completed the adoption of the two little girls that I had been instructed not to remove. I really hope racist mom loved the idea that a big, black cop has her kids. I don\u2019t know what happened to the boy and the cop couldn\u2019t tell me.", "CPS is only ever useful when the child isn't in danger.  \nI've seen CPS sit on their hands on actual abuse cases, but rip children from homes for ridiculous reasons.", "The fact that OP isn't even considering communication first is my problem. Calling CPS could mean a lifetime of struggling to get the kid back, them being placed in a even worse scenario, etc etc. Young moms make mistakes, talk to them, teach them. Why jump to a scenario which could get their child ripped from them...", "Then he needs to remove himself as an option by not providing childcare.", "Thank you! Not everyone can afford to pay for a house especially a young single mom \ud83d\ude44", "i am also a social worker.

I hope things get better for you.", "Yeah CPS is crazy.", "Well people really do not know what CPS does. Newsflash people, a substantial number of children either live in poverty or with a drug addicted or mentally ill parent or in a domestic abuse situation, and rarely does anything happen.", "I kind of feel like theres a difference between calling the police or something **when** she abandoned her child, but if you've already waited until she got home and now everyone is happy and you've got an opportunity to discuss things, then the right option is to discuss things, not call the cops afterward.\n\nLike if you have the discussion and its a shit show, then yeah, maybe call, but have the discussion first.", "Plus, OP works night shift and has to sleep during the day. How selfish of that woman. Can you imagine dropping off a kid at 3 am when someone is trying to sleep??", ">You sound like a good person who is looking out for this kid, and honestly, you can make a positive difference in this child\u2019s life! \n\nYou know, respectfully, these people are not in a relationship and never have been.

If you actually read the post, he says he was about to say no before she just walked out.", "I'm thinking that the woman already had a talk with the landlord about OP and his character, (a character reference) before moving in with a strange man, with her child.", "So you think it was in the kids best interest to be dumped on a random stranger without even getting his consent.  It would have served her right if OP had called the police and told them that his new roommate dumped her kid on him, without his consent and didn't leave contact information.  What would have happened if the kid had a medical crisis while the roommate was gone?", "Great suggestion. I've been involved with CPS many times as a teacher and I think they do a great job for the kids involved, but sometimes that involvement causes so many problems for the parents. Especially if the reports were fabricated. Had that happen to one of my students with exceptional parents\u2026it took weeks to sort out and tore a family apart. Hold off reporting, in this case, until you feel certain she is a danger to that child.", "Yes, I know. \n\nBut what about OP? Fortunately, he was concerned enough to reach out. He seems like a good guy. We can look at this situation with a bit of relief and feel comfortable saying, \u201cJust talk to mom and set a firm boundary. No need to call CPS.\u201d\n\nBut what if OP was a different kind of person?  We know nothing about this mom other than she left her female child with a strange man who could\u2019ve been a child predator.

Little girl tells mom \u2014totally innocently \u2014, \u201cI saw OP\u2019s pee pee?\u201d Imagine OP explaining that.
