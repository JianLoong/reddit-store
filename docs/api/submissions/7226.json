This Wednesday a new roommate moved in. She is a woman in her 20s, a single mom to an adorable 5 years old daughter.\n\nI have never met this woman before she moved in, she was brought in by our landlord, we had a 10 minutes convo Wednesday before I went to work (I work night shift).\n\nYesterday she woke me up at 7am (I got home at 3), she told me that she had to go to work, but that her daughter is in bed and if I would keep an eye on her. I was sleep deprived that by the time I was about to say no she had already left.\n\nAm I crazy or is it very dangerous to leave a 5 years old girl with a strange man? I am a good person, but she didn\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t even think I would be able to leave a kid with someone I knew for weeks, let alone minutes.\n\nHer kid is well taken care of, she is happy, they cuddled after her mom got from work, she read her a story, played with her and all, that\u2019s why I am hesitating.\n\nOh and she apologized for dumping her on me, apparently she wasn\u2019t even supposed to go to work, but there was an emergency.\n\nSo WIBTA if I called CPS on her?\n\nEdit: forgot to say, I have no problem with watching the kid, I actually love children, my issue is just with her mom not knowing me, not for watching the kid.\n\n**SINCE PEOPLE SEEM TO JUST IGNORE IT, MY ISSUE IS NOT WITH BEING LEFT TO CARE FOR THE KID, MY ISSUR IS WITH THE MOTHER BASICALLY LEAVING HER KID WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER**", "created_utc": 1673622792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10awwml/wibta_for_reporting_my_roommate_to_cps/", "score": 309, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In theory, if they had unlimited resources, they\u2019d come and just chat with mom. But no, no one would do anything. So YTA kind of, but I also know they likely wouldn\u2019t even screen in your call.\n\nYou can however call CPS if you babysit the child and mom says she\u2019ll be back at 6pm and it\u2019s now 7am and you can\u2019t get ahold of mom at all- in many regions that is considered child abandonment.", "NTA but don't call CPS, they won't do anything with this, but tell her that under no circumstances are you taking responsibility for her daughter and she needs to find other arrangements. this is nuts, the fact that she treated you like a stand in husband on your second day of being roommates is...concerning. set your boundaries NOW.", "I wouldn\u2019t call CPS.  They likely won\u2019t do anything to her anyway.   \n\nSide note-  I absolutely would not watch her child voluntarily until you know her better.  She could easily have a few screws loose and claim you SA\u2019d her daughter in the future.", "NTA. But consider a conversation first because the second time this happens is the time to call. There are absolutely ZERO work emergencies that I could have that would warrant leaving my 5 yo child alone with a strange man that I had met literally hours before. Especially when you work odd hours and did not agree to anything. This is so scary. Horrible parenting. And I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re now the de facto free babysitter. Nip this now.", "I think you *might* have had a case had you called CPS *at the time.*  \"I woke up to find my roommate had left her five-year-old alone with me. Now I have to leave for work, she's not home yet, and I don't even have her phone number.\"\n\nBut a day later, after she had gotten home, and you delivered her child safely to her? YTA for \"reporting\" her. The kid was safe; CPS isn't going to care how carefully a parent vets their babysitter, if the kid turns out to have been safe all along. \n\nYou do need to have a discussion with your roommate about this, though, and tell her it's unacceptable.", "WTF?  How long did she leave her with you?  How did she know you didn\u2019t have to go to work?  Did she leave a way to contact her?  I mean I guess I would be hard pressed to call CPS after one time, but it\u2019s a close call and one more misstep and I\u2019d be calling the cops.", "I personally wouldn't call CPS but WHO LEAVES THEIR CHILD WITH A STRANGER?? \n\nOP you're NTA for \\*considering\\* it but the mother is TA for 1) dumping her child on someone without talking to them first and 2) leaving her child with a STRANGER.\n\nP.s I know a few parents who leave their kids with people they know without asking first and I find that a problem, this takes it to another level.", "I don't understand most of the reactions in this post. \n\nOP, you have barely seen this woman for 10 minutes. Her and her kid are strangers. You don't even have her number, I'm guessing? You don't know the kid, the kid doesn't know you. You know nothing about school, allergies or medical issues. \n\nThis IS abandonment. If this happens again, contact the landlord, tell him the woman and her kid are not a good fit in the house, and have them call the woman and call the cops. You should have a record of this, in case anything happens, to cover your ass. \n\nAnd the poor kid is being left alone with a stranger, who could be a creep, could have a criminal record of some kind, could be on drugs, and outside of that, has nothing whatsoever to do with this kid.\n\nEdit: I read some of your comments. She was gone for 12 hours and you didn't know her name? Yeah no, that is abandonment. She's gonna pull this crap with every roommate. Definitely contact your landlord, make the report, and make it clear you will not babysit again. If she does leave the kid again, call the cops. You'll need official evidence.", "The situation needs to be addressed but I\u2019m not sure if it is worthy of calling CPS", "I think you'd be NTA but it also might be in your best interest to have a conversation beforehand. If it *really* was an emergency and not something that'll happen again it could be moved past. The issue with calling cps over this is that if she is actually a good mother, you're separating a child from their mother for no good reason, and thats potentially a lot worse than asking her new roommate to watch the kid for a few hours", "What she did was messed up, but I wouldn't report her to CPS just yet.  Hopefully this really was just a one time thing and a terrible lapse in judgement that will never happen again.\n\nQuestion...How long did she leave her daughter with you?", "You could call CPS and at most they will do a visit and see that the daughter is well taken care of and leave. AND the mom will probably. Have beef with you.\n\nFor the most part, she did nothing wrong. She knew where you lived and how to find you if anything happened. Work called her in and in order to keep good standing with her job (to continue providing for her daughter) she chose to trust her roommate. Yes she barely knew you, but it's the same with babysitters or nanny's. You don't get a chance to develop a deep relationship with them before trusting them with your child.\n\nWhile I'm not sure calling would make you an AH, it would make you.... Overzealous, and possibly cause issues between you and your new loving mother of a roommate. Maybe just talk with her and ask her a)why she chose to trust you and b) if she does that regularly.", "INFO: Have you spoken to her about what came up?", "I agree that what the mom did is very dangerous and shows a lack of awareness of the dangers her daughter could be in being cared for by strangers. Unfortunately, CPS probably won\u2019t be able to do anything. I am a teacher and we report unsafe situations all the time and CPS is rarely able to intervene. If this girl is fed, warm and cared for then I\u2019d have a conversation with the mom about the safety risks and set boundaries about when you\u2019re not available to watch the daughter. NTA but don\u2019t call CPS.", "You are right to think the mums behaviour is very, very ill-advised and - had you been a different sort of man to who you are - very dangerous for her daughter.\n\nBut is negligence like this a pattern? It doesn't need to be a repeated behaviour for you to feel uncomfortable about it but.... like, what would there be for CPS to investigate if this was a once off, or very rare, lapse of judgement? You call them and say 'A woman who I live with left her kid with me, and she didn't really know me well enough to trust me, nothing happened, but it could have, but it didn't. Can you send someone over right away?.' CPS workers can't do much with this - and Id say it would make you a soft YTA for calling in the big guns so early.\n\nOne thing is for certain though. You should not agree to mind the kid again. When you don't know the kid and mum at all, the danger cuts both ways. You are equally at risk.  If mum asks you to mind again, and you say 'no, I'm not comfortable with this' - and she leaves anyway? Then I'd call who you need to call.", "NTA - But I would not jump right to calling CPS. Have a conversation with her and set some ground rules. Rule 1 should be that you are not going to provide child care ever again. This is a complete stranger and child care is not included in her rent. There is no way to compromise on this without you eventually being taken advantage of.", "I get you are concerned, but there is generally two types of people who live their kid with someone they don't know, people who don't care and people who are desperate.\n \nIf she seems like a generally a good parent I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, especially considering she apologised. Realistically she's decided you are a certain level of safe because she moved in with you, and that will have factored  into her decision. She didn't come across you on the street, you're in her home.", "NTA....but I'd definitely talk to her first.  I'm a mom of a beautiful now, 25 yr old girl.  I'd NEVER  in my life leave my child with anyone I didn't know!  I've actually taken my daughter with me to work more than once when I was a single mom.  I was lucky to have a job that was like a big family and they allowed us to bring our kid to work if something came up.  She may not be in that same situation.  Please go talk to her before you call CPS.  Once that call is made there is no undoing that but I do understand your concern.", "NTA but calling right now is only going to cause tension between you two because since this is the first time then they are most likely not going to do anything. Talk to her or send her a text explaining that you are in no way responsible for her daugther and that the next time this happens without your explicit consent you will call the authorities for child abbandonment.  \n\n\nIf this happens again then you should send her a text (you are gonna need a pappertrail) saying that you did not agree to babysit and that she has X amount of time to get back or you will call the police/CPS.", "You can call the cops but they aren\u2019t gonna do shit. I use to work with CPS and they need to visibly see damage before they do shit.", "YWBTA because she lives with you.  In all honesty, if you're a bad man, you'll find an opportunity to try something with her daughter whether you babysit or not.  Essentially, what you're saying is she's a unfit parent because she can't afford her own place.  \n\nShe's a single mom, doing her thing with a 5 yo as best she can.  Chances are good she can barely afford the childcare she has, let alone emergency care.  And I would also bet that as a single parent, she feels the tenuousness of turning down a shift emergency quite clearly.  \n\nWhat is CPS going to do?  Do you WANT them to take her child away and put her in foster care?  CPS already can't pay their workers or give them a feasible workload, so I hope you don't think they'll pay for her child care.  Seriously, what outcome do you want from this?", "YWBTA. By that logic you should call CPS just because she was willing to LIVE with a complete stranger. Have a discussion about boundaries before you have a child removed from what you describe yourself as a good parent.", "NTA even if it was only 1 time. But the time to do that was while she was out of the building. Now she\u2019s back, you should have a serious conversation about her behaviour. It might have been an emergency for work, but that\u2019s not the same as an actual emergency. If someone was bleeding or on fire, leaving a child with a likely trustworthy stranger might, on balance of risks, be the best option. But that isn\u2019t what happened. And you didn\u2019t have time to answer her, she didn\u2019t ask or wait for your acknowledgement, you might have been leaving yourself at 8am, what would have happened to the child then?!", "NTA she abandoned her child with a complete stranger. Tell her if it ever happens again you will call the authorities there will be no phone calls as warning there will only be a call to cps. \n\nYou did not sign on to be her child care just because she moved into an apartment you live in.", "NTA except I would advise you to talk to her before going nuclear. I am flummoxed by the YTA votes. You regularly see people posting on here who have had siblings kids dropped on them and then they call the police and they're generally accepted to be NTA. I don't see how this is any different.", "I already made my judgement, but I\u2019m curious what all those Y W B T A people would think if this was currently happening - as in, the woman had dumped her kid with this guy an hour ago and he was still watching her.  Would he then be allowed to call CPS or the cops?  What if he had his own job to get to?  Why does mom get a pass because she just happened to luck out and leave her kid with a decent guy who didn\u2019t have any pressing engagements?", "Call the landlord and get this woman's phone number first. Give her a warning that if she does not get home in 20 minutes to claim her daughter that you are calling the authorities. When/if she gets home, inform her that you will not hesitate to call the authorities for child abandonment next time.\n\nNTA", "Calling CPS is a bit extreme. Maybe just talk to the Mum. Tell her you didn\u2019t exactly feel comfortable with it and explain why. Cause it really doesn\u2019t take much for someone to accuse YOU that\u2019s for sure", "YTA if you call them before talkung to her\n\n\nBuuuuuut don't let her use you as a live-in-nanny.\n\nYou are only roomates. She can't expect strangers to babysit", "ESH\n\nDon't bring CPS into it over one incident. Set your boundary that \"I am not comfortable watching your child again\" and see how it progresses. If you report her straight up you might end up with a very tense living arrangement.\n\nYou may be a stranger but she did leave the kid in the house with an adult which I suppose is better than her being alone. She's still an AH though.", "NTA TBH, I don\u2019t think she should have left her child with ANYONE she just met.", "YWBTA if you do it without expressing explicitly to the mum how dangerous this was. If mum still cannot see why this was a very stupid decision then YWNBTA for then calling CPS. Some people have no help, that time you watched her kid might have been the day she saved her job and stopped her becoming homeless and losing her kid anyway. Find out more about the situation before you call is what I say.", "YWBTA, now this is sort of a soft one because I that you have good intentions, however, I think this is a matter that can be settled within the house. She\u2019s living with you, so obviously she has some trust that you aren\u2019t going to be a nut case, but if you aren\u2019t comfortable watching the kid, then tell her that. It honestly sounds like she\u2019s doing the best she can for her little girl, and if you are willing to help then great! But if not, discuss that with her, the little girl is well loved and cared for, no need to bring CPS for this.", "ESH. She should not have left her kid with you like that, however to call cps over it youd be in the wrong over one time. If its repeatedly, its different. Whether or not they would do anything, i dont know. But what i do know is that they impact a familys life so much if they do get involved that unless it\u2019s absolutely needed then its better left without their involvement\n\nEdit: fixed a sentence", "YWBTA.\n\nI am assuming that since your landlord set you up, he/she also vouched for you, and that probably factored into her assumption that you are safe.\n\nWas it stupid?  Yes.   Irresponsible?  Yes.   But talk to her, address these points, and set boundaries now.   And make it clear that if you believe she is really putting her child at risk, you will not hesitate to report her.", "I would say ESH, but you only softly if you call CPS. It was beyond rude from her to dump her kid on you without letting you even the time to answer, but technically, you didn't refuse to care for the kid.\n\nBut calling CPS won't do a thing. She left the kid in a the custody of an adult, and you being a male doesn't change a lot. It's not illegal to leave a kid with a babysitter they don't really know.\n\nBut never hesitate to call CPS/police if you say NO and she still leave her kid with you. This is child abandonment and deserves a call to CPS.", "YWBTA if you called CPS on her.  However, you need to make it clear that you are not the last minute babysitter.  You are the roommate and you do not want to suddenly have your plans changed by her inability to find a sitter.\n\nShe needs to find someone willing to babysit on a moments notice.  There are plenty of babysitters out in the world and she can find one.  \n\n If you are willing to babysit for limited amounts of time, just tell her you will occasionally do it for no more than 2 hours with a days notice or whatever.  That way you maintain that she can depend on you for brief times but you need notice.... once you get to know them both.  Maybe after 6 months.", "This is a tough one, but I'd personally lay out your future expectations for her/tell her what she did can't happen again and work from there", "This situation is totally weird for a stranger to leave their 5 year old with another stranger for any prolonged period of time. If this has not happened again then I would just have a conversation with the mother to get to know her more and that it was awkward to be left with a child he met less than 24 hours ago. If this becomes a regular thing then I would certainly reiterate with the mother that this is not acceptable. Then if nothing changes contact the authorities. I would also be tempted to record EVERYTHING when you are with the child to CYA in case the mother starts making accusations. You never know. \n\nGood luck OP. NTA", "ESH - if you don\u2019t at least speak to her you would be. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine a situation where I would leave either of my kids with someone I hardly knew. That being said it is possible she had a very good report on you from the landlord and felt safe doing so. \n\nWhile technically it is abandonment you didn\u2019t actually tell her no, nor did you leave her unattended though it was short notice. You need to have a frank conversation with her and find out why she was ok with it. Make sure she knows any boundaries you have towards watching the kid since you seem ok with doing so and go from there. Definitely keep record in case it happens again and then I\u2019d definitely consider calling cps.", "What don't people get about this situation?\n\nThe mistake \"didn't cause harm?\" He \"agreed?\" He doesn't \"trust himself?\" What even...\n\nOP you are completely right. But I wouldn't call over this incident. If there's a second issue or it happens again, then you might.", "Nta but don\u2019t call cps is a disease once there called there hard to get rid off! and normally take children with good parents just trying to make do the best they can. They leave the kids that need to be removed with horrible parents in most cases", "YWBTA. Establish boundaries, and if there is abusive neglect ongoing you can call. But if we called CPS every time a parent had a stupid lapse of judgement then every kid in the world would be in foster care. Let's hope this is a one off for an otherwise good mom", "YWBTA  there are flags in her behavior for sure, I think the best thing is not to go nuclear out of the gate. She may have had a genuine emergency and had no choice. Check her behavior over a slightly longer period than just one example", "YTA\n\nOn this one instance? Yes YTA for calling CPS.\n\nJust bloody talk to her!", "YTA - Calling CPS is a huge jump. Just talk to your new roommate and explain that you are not there to be a babysitter, and that she needs to make other accommodations.", "CPS doesn\u2019t just come by and take the kid, bro. There\u2019s gonna be a weeks long investigation, even if there\u2019s nothing going on. Don\u2019t do it, please consider the welfare agents that are just as overworked and underpaid as the rest of us.", "YWBTA\n\nThe reaction doesn\u2019t match what actually happened. Sounds like this was an emergency & Mom had no other choice. She obviously trusts you... she moved in with you. While I agree this was far from a great decision it may have been her only option. What exactly would you be reporting to CPS? Something that didn\u2019t happen? There are no laws that prevent parents from leaving a child with a responsible adult. You sound like a responsible adult. CPS won\u2019t care how long you have known each other because the child was safe.\n\nYou now know who you are living with... so now is the time to sit down, have a conversation & set up some very clear boundaries with understood consequences if she continues this behavior.\n\neta \u2014 1 time is understandable but this is definitely red flag behavior so if I were you I would absolutely ask if she often gets \u201cemergency\u201d work calls & would make it very clear that you are NOT going to be the babysitter. But judging a person based on one incident where nothing bad actually happened is not really fair... especially not fair to her daughter.", "YTA.\n\nI work in CPS and first of all, this isn\u2019t even anything they would look in to. It happened one time and was an emergency situation. You\u2019re her roommate and were vetted by the landlord, so she has to have some  level of trust in you by default. The child by your own admission is happy and loved and well taken care of.\n\nListen, it would be one thing if she dropped her kid off at the park or a grocery store with a stranger and then left her there for hours. Or if this was something that she does regularly because she doesn\u2019t have a plan. But this was a work emergency, and she likely had no other choice. She was probably insanely stressed out and scared of losing her job. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t want to leave her kid home alone with someone she\u2019s not close with, and was just doing the best she could while stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nShe should have left you some more information, but this is not a reportable offense.", "YWBTA\n\nWhat she did was wrong and careless, but one time doesn\u2019t warrant a call to CPS in my opinion. When she gets home have a proper conversation with her; tell her she can\u2019t just dump her child on you and if she does want childcare she needs to discuss it with you well in advance. If she doesn\u2019t do this and continues to leave the child unattended, then you can take more drastic measures.", "NTA - just talk first and say you will call CPS if this happens again because this makes you extremely uncomfortable in many ways.", "I mean, kind of. I don't agree with her having done that, but seriously? She's your roommate (so she has to have some kind of trust even if she doesn't know you), and it might have been a very serious emergency. \n\nTalk to her and make sure it doesn't happen again and tell her you think thay's concerning and have considered calling CPS and will in the future if it continues to happen.\n\nBut if you do it after it happened once? Yeah, YTA, especially considering you like kids and didn't have a problem with it (not saying it's okay to dump her child on you because of that though, don't get me wrong)", "YTA does not begin to cover it if you call CPS right *now.* \n\nYou need to have a serious conversation and make clear that she cannot expect to be able to dump her daughter on you, that you are not a stand-in partner while she is single, perhaps even that you WILL call the authorities if she does it again, etc. \n\nBut CPS can completely destroy someone's life. It can permanently traumatize both children and parents. It sounds like she may have gotten a little too used to doing this with some other roommate(s).\n\nThe basically decent thing to do is have that conversation and see how she reacts: by doing it again and basically daring you to call, or takes it seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, what she did was wildly inappropriate. The consequences you'd bring down on her out of spite would dwarf her own act.", "If it realy is a one time thing, then yes ytah, If it becomes a regular thin try talking to her before calling cps", "YTA - CPS is a very serious call to make.  You need to talk with the roommate in detail.  Jesus the kid needs to be in serious danger before your turn her life upside.   BTW what are you going to do with a roommate that is pissed at you?", "YTA for even thinking about this, man.\n\nBabysitters often only get vetted for a few minutes, and your landlord clearly vouched for you or you wouldn't be living with a single mom.  What are you going to tell CPS? \"This woman asked me to babysit her kid but I might be a serial killer?\"", "NTAY but you WILL be the Asshole if you do call. What she did was not ok. At all. As a parent this infuriates and concerns me. BUT...I don't know her situation. Further, CPS is the absolute last venue anyone should have to deal with. They are understaffed, quick to judge and it is next to impossible to be redeemed and have them leave you alone. \n  \n  \nYou're getting a lot of comments saying similar things but you are replying with your justifications. I'm going to say that there are no justifications for calling CPS for this at this point. Talk to her. Tell her how absolutely insane and not ok it was and how you feel it put you into a moral dilemma. But the moment you call CPS for this instance? You're the absolute asshole.", "NTA at this point I don\u2019t know what you would say to CPS, she asked you if you would watch the kid, you said yes. You guys live in the same apartment it\u2019s not like she saw a dude on the corner and left her kid with him, even though it kind of is because you don\u2019t know each other. My point is that I don\u2019t think CPS would care about this because you said you would watch the kid. If she asked you and you said no and she left the child or if you just woke up and the child was alone then yes you must call CPS\n\nAnd because it sounds like you will probably have to call CPS at some point on this woman I just want to tell you that some states are mandatory reporting states, that means everyone is a mandatory reporter, which means if you suspect child abuse and neglect and you do not report it you are guilty of a misdemeanor crime. Furthermore, in the state that I live in, if there are housemates in a child abuse situation who do not intervene they have been charged with abuse and neglect as well, I don\u2019t know if they actually end up getting convicted, but you don\u2019t want to be involved in anything like that even just as a person listed as a cohabitate are for this girl. \n\nYou must call CPS if you see the minimum of standard of care not being given. You can make the call anonymously you just have to be careful of what you say because there will be transcripts I think her future lawyer will see like if you refer to her as your roommate she will obviously know one of her roommates called. But it\u2019s your duty as a grown-up in society to help protect the children, and in some states it\u2019s a legal requirement or you are committing a crime. \n\nI think the best thing to do right now would be to tell her look I need you to understand I\u2019m not a live-in babysitter, don\u2019t ever do that again. It would be OK to tell her not to even ask ever. It\u2019s a good idea to set out hard boundary right away so you don\u2019t feel resentful and so she doesn\u2019t pretend she thought it was OK to leave in the middle of the night with just you and her sleeping child at home.", "ESH\n\nYTA for calling CPS just over one instance. Just communicate (\"no, I won't be doing that, please figure out a different childcare arrangement\")\n\nShe is an asshole for just dumping her child (she is not entitled to free childcare just because she shares the living space with you) on basically a complete stranger.", "NTA but I'd maybe wait a bit just to see what her overall plan is. Does she have a normal babysitter or daycare or does she just randomly leave her daughter? If you aren't there, an essential stranger, would she still have left her? I dislike leaving my kids with family much less a person I've just met... it's a bit odd and a lot concerning", "NTA. I do think reporting her to CPS is a little too much.

She is a woman in her 20s, a single mom to an adorable 5 years old daughter.\n\nI have never met this woman before she moved in, she was brought in by our landlord, we had a 10 minutes convo Wednesday before I went to work (I work night shift).\n\nYesterday she woke me up at 7am (I got home at 3), she told me that she had to go to work, but that her daughter is in bed and if I would keep an eye on her. I was sleep deprived that by the time I was about to say no she had already left.\n\nAm I crazy or is it very dangerous to leave a 5 years old girl with a strange man? I am a good person, but she didn\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t even think I would be able to leave a kid with someone I knew for weeks, let alone minutes.\n\nHer kid is well taken care of, she is happy, they cuddled after her mom got from work, she read her a story, played with her and all, that\u2019s why I am hesitating.\n\nOh and she apologized for dumping her on me, apparently she wasn\u2019t even supposed to go to work, but there was an emergency.\n\nSo WIBTA if I called CPS on her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Would you feel responsible for not saying anything when you knew she had a history of making bad decisions? \n\nA innocent life is at stake. YWNBTA.

Something seems missing from this story.", "So you're assuming that Reddit knows more about whether this kid should be taken from her mom than trained officials doing their job. A report is not a demand that they be separated, it is a report. If the action doesn't warrant removing the kid unless it is part of a pattern, your report becomes evidence to be combined with additional reports to determine if there is a pattern, but not on its own the reason the family would be separated. That said, she lives with you and you have the ability to see a pattern yourself now. Personally, I'd document it. Write down everything that happened. If a pattern emerges, you will have details for a future call. If not, not. People make mistakes and people have emergencies and if kids were taken from their parents for every single instance like this, good parents would lose their kids and there would be no one left who was \"qualified\" to care for them. But CPS knows that and they know of any history mom has that might make this look different from a one-time mistake as well.", "YTA yeah. Just explain to her that you weren\u2019t comfortable with her choice. Sounds like a 1-off.", "I'm sure I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but **NTA**\n\nAs someone who was SA as a very young child, I'm horrified by the fact that almost everyone here is so concerned about the mother, and not prioritising the safety of this 5-year-old child (which ironically, is what you are trying to do). Sometimes I find this sub genuinely disturbing in its skewed priorities, with everyone worried about \"mind your own business\" and \"stop shaming struggling moms\" but no one actually worried about the fact that this mom is ENDANGERING HER 5-YEAR-OLD CHILD.\n\nAnd guaranteed, if this woman didn't hesitate to leave her 5-year-old with a complete stranger, a man in his 20s whom she'd known for all of about 10 minutes before moving them in with him, then THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, and left her child with someone she barely knows. Someone who sees a guy she doesn't know in any meaningful way as a safe caretaker for her preschool-aged child is a person who has absolutely left her kid alone with other virtual strangers before \"in an emergency\" or when she \"had no choice.\" And that's the thing. There is always a choice. ALWAYS. I know mothers who would rather risk getting fired and ending up homeless than leave their small child alone with someone they know nothing about if that's the choice, because at least they know their child is safe. But THERE IS ALWAYS A CHOICE. And leaving your small child alone with a strange man is never the right one.\n\nIn this case, WE KNOW that OP wasn't dangerous, but his brand new roommate did not. She didn't know him at all. \n\nThis isn't about her taking advantage of his kindness. This is about her leaving her 5-year-old alone with a strange man with no more than a, \"She's in bed. I'll be back in several hours.\" WTF?\n\nYou should absolutely call CPS. It is doubtful that the child will be taken away, but this woman 100% needs parenting classes and to be taught how to keep her child safe. When the statistics say that \"sexual abuse most often happens from someone known to the child\" THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. It's wonderful that OP turned out not to be a predator, but it was triggering to me even to read that the mother did this, it was so incredibly unsafe. You absolutely WNBTA for calling CPS. She needs help and support to learn how to keep her child safe. Please. Before this goes terribly wrong.", "Sure just ruin her life why don\u2019t you? \n\nYWBTA", "Today is a new day. Talk to your roommate and boundaries should be established ASAP. This situation should not be repeated again. What she did was pretty dumb but calling CPS is kinda dumb now.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I understand your concern, getting CPS involved over this could be a disaster.\n\nYes, it's not a good idea to leave your 5 year old with a stranger.  But consider this - she's a single mom who got called into work unexpectedly with no time to arrange for child care.  It's likely that your landlord told her that you are a good person, with good character when she was looking for a place to live.  Otherwise, why would she move into an apartment with a 5 year old daughter with a man she doesn't know at all?  She probably felt like she could trust you under these circumstances.\n\nI think you need to have a talk with your roommate about the situation, and say that you felt uncomfortable because you hardly know them, and that going forward she needs to work out a plan in case she is called in to work last minute - you might not always be able to watch her child and the mom needs to give you a chance to tell her that.  You also need a way to contact her in case of emergency.\n\nPlease don't call CPS over one incident.  If there were a pattern of abuse or neglect, then I would say call, but this was just one incident.  Getting CPS involved can turn your roommate's life into a nightmare - constant visits, evaluations, appointments - and interfere with her job as well.\n\nIf it happens repeatedly, even after a discussion with your roommate, that's another matter.", "Put yourself in the mother's shoes.  Apparently she is a single mom and has no other alternatives.  She has to go into work or possibly lose her employment.

I would talk with her--tell her that you were uncomfortable and why but calling CPS is something you do when there is abuse. This does not rise to that level of concern.  I cannot imagine you wish to make this woman's life and her daughters' any more difficult than it is already or you would not have asked for others' opinions.", "NTA. This mom is a train wreck. Who leaves a 5 year old with a stranger? Thank God you are a good person. Mom was gone for 11 hours. What if you couldn\u2019t watch her for that long? You can\u2019t leave a 5 year old alone either. Mom will keep doing this if you don\u2019t set boundaries. Also, if you leave the child alone and something bad happens, you could end up in jail yourself. I don\u2019t think a CPS call is warranted this time but Mom needs to be told not to do leave her child like that again.", "YWBTA but I understand your concerns. You need to give informed consent when agreeing to look after a kid.\n\nTalk to her and tell her it\u2019s not acceptable to leave her kid with a complete stranger (you). Don\u2019t let her set a precedent.", "ESH for now, but you need to discuss child care with your roommate.  Including telling her that, if she leaves her child with you without you specifically saying at the time and every time that you are taking responsibility, that you will contact the authorities for child abandonment.  She will treat you as a permanent unpaid babysitter if you let her.", "Please don't do this. I know you are young, but you need to learn some people skills. Sit her down very matter of fact and tell her you cannot under any circumstance watch her child. If she ever tries to just leave the kid there quietly without asking you you then tell her that if she leaves, you will call the police on her. You need to give her a proper warning. She might think it isn't a big deal for you to watch the kid. You need to make her know that it is a very big deal to the point that the police (and subsequently CPS) will be called. Unless she is a complete idiot, she won't do it again.", "ESH.\n\nDid you have to undergo a background check to get your apartment? Is there a chance your landlord provided your name to your roommate so she could run a background check on you prior to moving in?\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance she did some cursory research before moving in with you. So even though she doesn\u2019t know you well and shouldn\u2019t be dumping her kid on you last minute, she may have felt comfortable enough considering people have similar interactions with babysitters before using them for the first time. \n\nCalling CPS is a wild over reaction on your part. What would you even say to them? Your roommate asked you to watch her kid for a work emergency but you feel like you don\u2019t know her well? They would investigate both you and her, find out that nothing actually happened except she was inconsiderate and you were inconvenienced and you\u2019ve wasted everyone\u2019s time and inflicted trauma on a mother and child. \n\nTalk to your roommate. Say you were put in the spot since you don\u2019t know her/her kid that well and you\u2019d like to get to know them better.

Wtf lol", "YWBTA you need to have a talk with the mother about what the hell she was thinking but CPS would be a step to far unless she continues to put her daughter in dangerous situations", "Two things can be true at the same time - 1) you can love your child 2) you can make poor choices in regards to your child. \n\nThat being said, I think a frank conversation is in order with this woman. Like you said, you\u2019re a good person, but she didn\u2019t know that. The poor judgment shown by this woman and potential danger she put her child is absolutely terrifying! She 100% needs to caller out. I think once you have a conversation with her you can make a decision if this is truly CPS worthy or if it was a one time, unfortunate mistake.", "YWBTA Why would you immediately resort to calling CPS? A good person would deal with the situation and then talk to her when she gets home. If this was a continuous problem and you defined a clear no that you won\u2019t take care of the child, that\u2019s different.\n\nOh and I\u2019m not excusing what she did. This is basically abandonment, but CPS is a bit of a stretch when you\u2019d probably be forced to continue living with her", "You should always call CPS if you think a child is in danger. It is CPS\u2019s job to decide to investigate. You can make an anonymous report. \n\nIn this case they most likely would not investigate. She did not leave her child unattended. CPS doesn\u2019t care about things that didn\u2019t happen, unless it falls under the category of neglect. \n\nIf you seen on going neglect, call CPS.

Calling CPS is a drastic move. However, I think it's good to be concerned about her dumping her child on you without knowing you but she did choose to be your roommate so she would naturally hope you're not that bad of a person. What you need to do is set boundaries on this situation. Talk to her and your landlord because you pay rent and you live there and shouldn't be used as a live in babysitter. You set a precedent by letting her do it the first time and not even calling her to let her know you weren't okay with this and she should have someone to call when these kinds of situations happen. That person should not be you.", "No please don\u2019t call CPS!", "Honestly parents leave their children with strangers all the time. Here are some examples\n\nIf we need a babysitter, and I see a flyer that the 16 year old neighbor has put on the group mailboxes, I call her and have her come over for an hour to talk to her, then proceed to allow her to babysit.. that's a stranger. \n\nI put my child in a new daycare, I've talked to the facility manager but haven't actually spoken to anyone in the daycare room, that's multiple strangers.\n\nI just gave birth, and my 15 minutes old baby is whisked away to the nursery for shots and tests to make sure everything is okay.. all of those people except for the doctor who delivered the baby... are strangers. \n\nI can see where you are coming from, not being comfortable watching a strangers child, but you YWBTA if you reported this single occurrence to CPS.

I don't think what she did was right, or smart, but if her daughter otherwise is well taken care of and safe then I'd just have a conversation with her. If she keeps doing it, I'm still not sure if CPS is the way to go, but I'm not an expert on these things. I guess you could call the cops and claim child abandonment, then CPS would likely get involved, but that's not something I would do unless things were getting out of hand. \n\nI would also consider that if your landlord placed her, he/she must have vouched for you being a good person before she moved in. I know if I were a single mom being placed with a male, I'd be asking A LOT of questions on who he is and his character. I still think it's very presumptuous for her to just leave her kid with you, a virtual stranger, but if it was a work emergency then maybe she had no other choice. Maybe she would have been fired if she didn't go in, and she couldn't afford to get fired. Have a conversation with her. Ask what her typical childcare situation is like. Let her know that while you were able to do it just that once because you didn't have time to say no, you would rather not be a childcare option in the future. \n\nFWIW, since you emphasized that your issue is not with watching her but with the fact that her mom left her with a complete stranger, I think your heart is in the right place, I just think there are other ways to go before you go the nuclear direction.", "Ex teacher here and mandated reporter. I would have called CPS and the police as soon as she walked out the door.", "NTA. She abandoned her child with a stranger. I know you said you don't have a problem baby sitting but you don't know this woman and don't know if she's going to turn around and pin something on you like SA or who knows.

What if something had happened to the kid while she was gone?\n\nPersonally I would inform her if she does that again, I'd be calling the cops for an abandoned child and leave it to the cops to decide the best course of action regarding CPS.", "YWBTA, and honestly, as far as the safety aspect is concerned, it feels weird that you would think she\u2019d have a problem asking the people she lives with if they would watch her child. Obviously, she felt the place was safe enough to move into in the first place, otherwise you\u2019re saying that moving in with you was a questionable and dangerous decision on the mom\u2019s part.\n\nNow, the way the babysitting happened is an issue and you really do need to talk to her so that it doesn\u2019t happen that way again in the future. Right now, with just one incident of her needing to go to work for an emergency and assuming that the roommate she feels safe enough to for her kid to live with would be a safe person for the kid to spend time with? I don\u2019t see it as a CPS issue. It\u2019s an interpersonal issue where boundaries need to be set for the future.

They can at least take a report. They will determine if it\u2019s necessary to call CPS. Who knows, maybe she\u2019s got a history.

I might even talk to the landlord about it if I suspect it will be an ongoing issue.", "My concern would be with it happening again. The way this went down is that she didn\u2019t ask. She told, then left her child with a stranger. Having a conversation with her is so important. This could be a one-off thing and while still VERY wrong of the mother, didn\u2019t result in harm. However, what\u2019s to say this doesn\u2019t become a habit. What if you had had a meeting/appointment/work yourself and couldn\u2019t stay. The lack of communication and forced childcare is sooooo not cool!  I would for sure now be watching her and her parenting habits. Keep note of things that concern you with dates and times. And too, I\u2019m so sorry to say, but her leaving you alone with her child could be a sign of manipulation. If it was desperation, ok\u2026 no harm no foul, but there is the potential for her to use your gender against you if she is indeed a manipulator. Watch for things in your conversation (like her saying it was no big deal, or turning it on you and becoming upset that you may be a predator) to see how sorry she was/is for doing what she did. This is very very poor parenting. If she says sorry and strives to do better, well\u2026 most parents have done some sketchy things at times. We\u2019re human and we make mistakes. But owning those mistakes and trying for better is what the take away needs to be here. NTA at all. Thank you for being an advocate for someone with a very little 5 year old voice right now.", "NTA.  I actually commend you for getting opinions before acting.  Try conversating with this neighbor before calling CPS.  It wasn't cool what she did but try monitoring the situation for a while.  Also, if she does it again, you may need to set boundaries.  Abuse isn't always verbally, physically, or emotionally.

Considering I\u2019ve heard of CPS being called for a mom running into a grocery store for 5min and leaving her 10yr old in the car (in the winter, no danger of overheating), yeah, I don\u2019t think the OP would have been out of line for calling CPS.  I mean I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t, and I hope he can sort it out with roommate, but he would have been well within his rights.", "Why are some people incapable of having an actual conversation before going for the nuclear option?", "What are you going to tell CPS though? This woman lives in the same apartment that I live in so we sleep 50 feet away from each other and when she asked me to babysit I said yes! The horror!\n\nIf OP is on a sex offender list then she shouldn\u2019t be living there in the first.  If he\u2019s not how is this very different than her hiring a babysitter off the Internet? Like someone else mentioned the landlord has already vetted this guy, she LIVES WITH HIM", "I'm curious how OP is thinking this would play out too? You call CPS, they'll do a check up, nothing would likely happen, she's not an \"unfit\" mother, she just made a questionable decision. All parents have done that a time or two in one way or another. But after the visit, you still have to live with her and the 5yo. Talk about making an awkward environment..", "Judging from the post, OP is a complete stranger both to the mother and child. You're really telling me it isn't extremely dangerous for a mother to leave her child with someone she doesn't know?", "He\u2019s making himself look really bad by agreeing to it and then complaining about it and buy telling everyone he shouldn\u2019t be trusted around a child. Should he not be sharing an apartment with the child? Now I feel like I need to call CPS. But on the roommate.", "I am not implying anything, if I was a bad person I would not be posting her. What I am saying is that *she* did not know what kind of person I am and left her kid with me. This time it was fine since I am a good person (even a normal human being), but what if she does it again with someone who isn\u2019t?", "come on. you have to know that he's not implying that at all lol. hes saying that the mother didn't know him at all and left the kid with him without caring if he was a good guy or not.", "They all live in the same apartment. If you trust someone enough to sleep in the bedroom next to theirs and to share a bathroom with them, that really doesn\u2019t mean you should trust them enough to watch your kid, but it doesn\u2019t make them a complete stranger. I mean I wouldn\u2019t want a complete stranger alone in my apartment with all my stuff all day while I work but I\u2019ve had to have roommates that were complete strangers at the time.", "he did in another comment, less than 10 mins the day before, he didn't even know their names when she ran off.", "He said she just moved in Wednesday and they\u2019d met for 10 minutes prior to this happening.  He didn\u2019t even know her name.", "Eh, I suppose so, but I\u2019m just saying that I wouldn\u2019t call someone TA for merely thinking about it.  I mean this guy was obviously decent enough to watch the girl for the entire day, so calling him TA in any way, shape, or form just seems wrong.  Mother was EXTREMELY lucky that OP was willing to do that and actually likes kids.", "A roommate reference is not the same as a baby sitter reference", "Yeah I get what you mean, like at some point she will be showering or something and the kid will effectively be left alone w/ him for long enough for damage to happen.", "Not everyone uses babysitting agencies. I literally don't know anyone who ever has. Parents I know use babysitters who are the kids of family friends. In part for exactly that reason.", "I don't think you're being a judgy AH, because I certainly wouldn't leave my hypothetical kid with a strange man either. \n\nDefinitely don't call CPS; this could very well be a one-off and it doesn't seem like abuse so much as last minute panicking and \"as long as my kid doesn't burn the house down we have an adult present and I didn't see any red flags\" situation. \n\nThe girl has a good relationship with her mom, you're not a r*pist, and the mom seems to know that she can't leave her kid with you on the daily so I think no harm, no foul here.", "I think you are coming from a good place, and that she made a mistake. But honestly, it sounds like she was desperate and just not thinking. Besides the fact that CPS has bigger issues to deal with, the fact that you are even considering blowing up both their lives when, by your own admission, she seems like a good mom and you have no basis to think this was anything more than a serious lapse in judgment, and haven\u2019t discussed it with her personally yet\u2026 yes, you are being a bit of a judgy asshole.", "I think you should tell the mother you cannot babysit again. If she tried again I would refuse and call your landlord.", "It might be paranoia but I was thinking the same thing. It kinda sounds like he's trying to compensate for something..", "I didn\u2019t read it at all like that. The very same thought would go through my mind as well. And I am a woman. \u2018Wtf I could be anyone and could do anything to that child! \n\nThat\u2019s the first thought if a stranger would drop their child into my lap.", "Then why didn't you get her contact info immediately from the landlord for her name, number, and work to CONTACT HER DIRECTLY?\n\nIf you're that concerned you don't wait until after the fact. And calling CPS after you'd already watched the kid would be incredibly foolish, as there's no crime or abuse to report.", "He didn\u2019t actually say yes, it sounds like she just left before he could even get his wits about him.", "I guess it depends what checks were done on OP beforehand and how long he has been renting. Honestly in this market you canbonly survive as a sharer unless you have a good income so I doubt she had much choice but to share.", "I find this train of thought absolutely insane. \n\nYou just report what happened. That's literally it. It is logged and may or may not form part of a bigger picture in relation to that particular child. If it's a one off, no harm no foul. But ultimately it could save a child's life.", "They live together so yes they are strangers but she had to have a certain amount of trust in this person to sleep in the same apartment with them, she\u2019s going to take a shower at some point is she taking her kid into the bathroom with her or if she trusting the stranger not to do something weird to her kid because they live in the same apartment. You guys are acting like she walked out onto the street and found a guy on the corner and said hey watch this kid for me.\n\nBut you don\u2019t think it\u2019s dangerous for a man to take responsibility for a child he doesn\u2019t know from a woman he doesn\u2019t know? If the kid bumps itself and ends up with a bruise he trusts this woman to believe that it\u2019s an accident and not call the police and say he beat her child?", "And when you call CPS the first question would be \"Did you agree to watch the kid?\"\n\nYOU need to talk to the mom, and lay out your issue. But you agreed to it so involving them is going to open a can of worms on your own head.", "But dude you guys share an apartment and she doesn\u2019t know what kind of person you are. If you were going to do something to her kid you could do it while she\u2019s taking a shower or while she\u2019s outside getting the mail. She already has to trust you to live with you. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re not getting this it\u2019s not like you are someone standing on the corner waiting for a bus and she walked up and said hey can you watch my kid while I go into the store. Unless there\u2019s a good reason you shouldn\u2019t be around children that you\u2019re just not telling us. Is that a problem? Cause you\u2019re making a huge deal out of this it seems really weird.", "You sound like that scene from its always sunny in Philadelphia where he keeps saying women on the boat will have to hook up with him because of the implication but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s forcing them to do anything.\n\nTelling complete strangers online that you are a good trustworthy person but implying that something could have happened if you weren\u2019t makes you sound creepy", "All this \"if I was a bad person\" crap just makes you look more and more shady", "With this in mind, I'm shocked at the amount of people who think OP is TA. People are so wrapped up in the cps part they fail to see that this woman left her 5 year old with a complete stranger!", "This makes her TA imo.", "For thinking about escalating to CPS. Like calling the cops, you should only do it if there's immediate danger or if you've exhausted other options.", "It's bigger! It is absolutely bigger.", "Oh, sure, I was just thinking that she sleeps at night.", "The time to call CPS was when she left the child with you. \n\nIt's too late now, but you absolutely should have a conversation with her. She left her child with you for 11 hours with no permission, no instructions, and no way to reach her. How tf would she even assume that you were free for the next 11 hours? \n\nYou need to make it absolutely clear that this cannot happen again, and if it does, you will drop the child at the police station on your way off to whatever you had planned that day. You can tell her you had a pleasant time with the child and may be willing, on occasion, to sit with her for an hour with prior permission, but you are not child care. Lay down the expectation now, because it will get worse now that she got away with it once.", "> first question would be \u201cDid you agree to watch the kid?\u201d \n\nhe was going to say \u201cno\u201d but the roommate left before he could. so no, i don\u2019t think he did agree to watch the kid.", "They literally met for ten minutes the day before this happened.  I\u2019d call that \u201cstrangers\u201d and I\u2019d call it amazingly weird for this woman to leave her kid with a roommate she DID NOT KNOW.  I mean maybe I\u2019m way different than you, but my mere possessions don\u2019t hold a candle to my KIDS.", "Whatever man, I might be an AH for thinking of reporting her, that\u2019s on me. But you just dismissing what could be genuine concerns as me being a misogynist is something more than AH behavior. If this was a father that did the same thing, or if I was woman that she knew for the same time frame, I would have the same concerns. We just seem to have different life experiences, if you are that trusting of strangers", "Seriously between that and insisting that it\u2019s not safe for him to be around kids I feel like we should call CPS on him", "Then he needed to immediately contact the landlord for the mother's contact info. If he called them THEN, it would make more sense.\n\nCalling them after the fact won't solve anything since the kid was fine.", "I am not saying that I am trusting of strangers or would leave my kid with a total stranger, what I am saying is you keep replying to peoples comments saying that if you were a bad guy you could have done many bad things to that little girl which is what makes you sound like there is something more so wrong with you and I hope your roommate sees this post and moves out.", "Why did you agree to it if it was so weird? That\u2019s kind of weird to me. What if this lady came home and said you touched her child? Do you know her well enough to know that she\u2019s not going to make up stories for sympathy and attention? Do you know her well enough to know that child hasn\u2019t been through some trauma that might get blamed on you because you were the most recent person to be alone with her? If it was wrong you were just as wrong for agreeing to it. Get a backbone.", "I don\u2019t have kids but I can tell you that I\u2019m not trusting enough to watch a strangers child. What if it bumps into the coffee table and ends up with a bruise and stranger flips out and reports me for assaulting her child. What if it\u2019s been through some trauma that comes out in a few months and I was the most recent person to babysit that child. what if the parent just doesn\u2019t come back to pick it up? I wouldn\u2019t trust a stranger who would trust a stranger to leave me with their child I would assume they were trying to pin some thing on me or that they would be some kind of accident that I would be responsible for because I\u2019m taking responsibility for this strange child.", "I think we\u2019ve found the mother\u2026", "please point out where it says he agreed to it", ">what if the parent just doesn\u2019t come back to pick it up?\n\nIt? Really dude?\n\nI don't see how this falls on OP. This woman just left her child with a stranger. He never agreed to watch the child."]}
