{"id": 11993, "submission_id": "11o2pv1", "title": "AITA for kicking my sister out?", "selftext": "I never thought that a simple decision could cause such a huge rift in my family. My sister, who we'll call \"Liz\", had just broken up with her boyfriend of three years and was looking for a place to stay. She had been living with him for the duration of their relationship, and now she was left without a home.\n\nLiz had always been a bit of a free spirit. She didn't like to be tied down, and she had always been the type to go where the wind took her. I, on the other hand, was much more grounded. I had a steady job, a house, and a routine. We were very different people, but we had always been close.\n\nWhen Liz called me to tell me what had happened with her boyfriend, I could tell that she was upset. I offered to let her stay with me until she found a new place to live. I thought it was a simple solution, and I didn't think it would be a big deal. I was wrong.\n\nAs soon as I told Liz that she could stay with me, she started making plans. She told all of her friends that she was moving in with me and started packing up her things. I didn't realize how serious she was until she showed up on my doorstep with all of her belongings in tow.\n\nAt first, everything was fine. Liz was grateful for my help, and we spent a lot of time catching up. However, as the days went on, I started to realize that having Liz living with me was going to be more difficult than I had anticipated.\n\nFor one thing, Liz had no sense of boundaries. She would go through my things without asking and would eat my food without permission. I tried to talk to her about it, but she would always say that we were family and that it was okay.\n\nAnother issue was that Liz had no job and no money. She had always been a bit of a free spirit, but I had never realized how little she had planned for her future. She would spend all day lounging around the house, watching TV, and using my internet. I knew that I couldn't support her forever, but I didn't know how to bring it up without causing a fight.\n\nThe final straw came when Liz started bringing men over to my house. She had always been a bit of a flirt, but I was shocked when I realized that she was using my home as a hookup spot. I tried to talk to her about it, but she brushed me off and said that I was being uptight.\n\nIt was at that point that I realized that I couldn't have Liz living with me anymore. I told her that she needed to find a new place to live, and she was furious. She accused me of being selfish and heartless, and she said that I had no idea what it was like to be in her position.\n\nWe argued for hours, and in the end, Liz stormed out of my house and didn't speak to me for weeks. I was heartbroken that my decision had caused such a huge rift in our relationship, but I knew that it was the right thing to do.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I heard from other members of my family who were furious with me. They said I was being selfish, but was I truly the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1678486824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o2pv1/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were just trying to help her out short term - which you did. \nWhen your Family calls up having a fit? Tell them to put up or shut up!

Like all of her behavior while mooching off of, ahem, staying with you?  Because if they do and are still mad, then they are probably why she is like this.
