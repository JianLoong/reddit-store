He said jump and your only reaction can be: how high? You can't say no? \n\nYou're in an argument with him and his way of \"winning\" it is to leave you stranded behind? And now your fighting because he left you stranded and not because : you're not ALLOWED to bring up topics for discussion between you two.", "When you will be 42 years old you will realize why its wrong to date a 20 year old girl as a 40 year old man.", "The thing is I couldn\u2019t go to my address as we are in a different place (I\u2019d have to fly home) so yeah. We have actually been planning a trip which obviously doesn\u2019t seem it will work if this is happening before we even leave \ud83d\ude24", "Not my friend's prolapsed uterus, as that's not something I'd share without them. But the concept, and how terrifying it is, sure. I'd want all my friends with uteruses (and a bunch of those without) to know it's a possibility of childbearing. Because bodies are weird, and sharing knowledge is cool.", "Exactly :)", ">We were sitting having a coffee, and I randomly read on Google how you can get uterus prolapse from giving birth. I asked if he\u2019d ever heard or seen someone with a uterus prolapse. He gets super controlling and tries to tell me that I should talk about \u2018things of value\u2019 and he refuses to have this talk with me (mind you he talks to me about stuff all the time, but apparently I can\u2019t ) he has huge double standards - he\u2019s admitted he does and that triggers me.\n\nWas OP TA for asking his whether he'd ever heard or seen someone with a uterus prolapse?\n\nAnd by extension is that an inappropriate question to ask in public?\n\nThat's what I was asking.", "Yes.  I would.  Lots of women would.  You don't name names but it's SUPER important to share ALL the serious consequences of pregnancy with people,  so they know what they're getting into. So they know it's REAL, and not just another in the long list of bs warnings doctors and pharmacists give you that never happen to anyone.  \n\nToo many people keep absolutely mum about this shit until a woman is pregnant,  and then they dump it all on her after it's already too late to take the information into consideration. \n\nStop putting limits on when and how women discuss women's health issues.  It leads to ignorance.", "I get this but I made sure I asked when NO ONE was around us or anywhere near us. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to hear", "Is it about uterine prolapse specifically? What if I overhear two people talking about a condition I have (say diabetes or PCOS) and they're saying ignorant things about it? Yeah, I would feel annoyed and want to interrupt their conversation, but should they just not talk about diseases or conditions they don't know anything about because someone with that disease or condition could overhear? Genuinely curious about this?", "That sounds like he was being an asshole to you. (And you, to yourself, a little bit, because being stranded would have sucked, but not as much as staying in his company.)", "He says he wants to bring it up in therapy , I do too let\u2019s see ..", "Not immature to ask at all. It's such a serious thing that we should all have more knowledge about. One of my friends ended up with one when we were in our mid 20s. \nAnd then *after* I had my kid at almost 30 I found all the conversations about how common it is.", "And OP told him to leave - that parts on her. \n\nBoyfriend is an AH in every imaginable other way.", "I did ask if he\u2019s ever seen this in person but to me it wasn\u2019t making fun of the situation or being weird about it at all, I didn\u2019t know that could happen and was shocked, it came from a place of curiosity and immaturity maybe for asking but definitely wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d get jealous over (obviously)", "And also it's possible that you were being unfair. Maybe you portrayed yourself in a much better light and maybe you are an Ahole to him all the time.\n\nThe thing is, if two people are horrible to each other, their shittiness doesn't cancel each other out. Their combined shittiness just creates a toxic environment. They should both work on themselves to become better people.", "Are you her 42 year old man telling her to apologize to you for not following your command?\n\nOp, don't apologize, you did not get in the car so HE LEFT YOU!  KNOWING YOU COULD NOT GET BACK!! You apologizing will only make him think he was right to treat you like this! Don't!", "You would ask your boyfriend/husband about their experiences? Or would you maybe discuss your own concerns regarding the information you just read.... oh Wow I just learned ..... we should talk about that.", "Be careful. Narcissists can sometimes use therapy to manipulate their partners and the therapists themselves. I see in another comment he admits to having Narc traits", "You should absolutely discuss any & all your concerns regarding health information that you just read & always look for more information from trusted sources. Your boyfriend\u2019s experiences are not going to gain you any more knowledge because he can only report on someone else\u2019s experience. You\u2019re just going to be talking about another woman\u2019s medical information."]}
