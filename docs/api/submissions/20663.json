The nice thing to do would have been to get takeout/takeaway on the way home from work and cuddle with you. I think this is something that might be grounds for divorce, because it shows he doesn't care about you or your needs. I mean, does he even care about the baby, at all? Does he realize that you probably need more sleep while pregnant, so the baby can be healthy? I'm surprised he didn't drop your dog onto your belly. That would really be an I-want-a-divorce-thing to do.\n\nMaybe you should spend some time at a hotel, by yourself, if you can afford it, so that you can get all the sleep you need.

And, I will never forget him being \"obligated\" to go to a building dedication (yes, he was the director, but it was a planned c-section) leaving me to ask his worst cousin to get our car to pick me and his second child home.  Please take care, and I hope you have friends, or, at least the resources to hire a post-birth doula.
