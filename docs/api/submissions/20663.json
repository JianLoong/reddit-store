It sounds to me like your husband was feeling resentful/ignored/idk what because of your nap and decided to wake you up rudely with your dog. Then backtracked with an excuse.

And I have to ask: does your husband often do things you didn't ask for/want, then insist you should be grateful for them? Does he then blame you for being annoyed/angry about the fact that he blatantly disregarded your wishes? Does he only focus on his feelings about your reaction (rather than hear your perspective)?
