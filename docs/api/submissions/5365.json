Although totally get you are in pain and tempers are shortened. Been there! I have had to take oxy after several surgeries and never got addicted. Heck, I still have some left from a major surgery I had in January. I think your husband is overly sensitive due to his addiction.

He\u2019s clean atm, but he\u2019s always an addict. His fear is genuine. He literally has it in reach.  Keep those pills under lock and key only you have. And also, if you are allowed ibuprofen in recovery I\u2019d double down Tylenol and Advil (or whatever brands you prefer) take them in combo or alternating for safer pain management than opiates. \n\nYes, it\u2019s totally fine to take both of those at the same time. They are different drugs and affect the body differently.  \n\nGood luck op.

And I don't think any of them took that first pill thinking \"I hope I get addicted to this.\"  If fact, I'd bet a lot of those that got addicted felt the same way that you feel - that it won't happen to me.\n\nSo the truth is that you really don't know that you're different from him and that you won't get addicted.\n\nSo, apologize to your husband for being insensitive and take the risk of addiction to the pills seriously and be careful with them.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband is trying to help you and you insult him.", "YTA. First, he is simply looking out for you. Your comeback sucks and you are basically saying he's weak. Horrible!\n\n I, too, had surgery and was given the 10 pills, but I refused them because they can still cause addiction. It isn't about prone to addiction, drugs can be habit forming because they affect your brain. I told Dr. not to give me Rx, but it wound up coming home with me. I refused them as much pain I was in. I dropped them off at the pharmacy medical box after removing the label to have it destroyed once I recovered. My Dr was shocked to hear it during the follow-up.", "YTA.  \"I'm not you\" says you're superior to him in this regard.

You are in a lot of pain, so you said an insensitive thing that made his experience out as a character flaw, rather than a predictable outcome of a corrupt pharmaceutical system.  He is just expressing concern for you based on his personal expereience.  I am sure when he took his 1st pill he never expected to get addicted.  No one does. He doesn't want to have what happened to him happen to you.  You don't have to be in pain and follow his advice, but don't lash out at someone and use their past vindictively when all they are doing is trying to protect you and themselves from further harm.  Don't leave pain killers somewhere that he can see or have access to them in any way.  That is probably his biggest fear.", "I said NAH, but I would not drink in front of my SO if he/she was an ex alcoholic. I would do it by myself or with friends, unless told it was okay.", "Opiods are no joke.  Most addicts are like the husband - they didn't pick up a needle and make it a choice to become a junkie.

They're very addictive, and addiction isn't a choice.", "See, that was my thought.

I also was prescribed opiates after my wisdom teeth were removed, used them for a week, then eventually threw the rest away. Literally had zero desire to take the meds for anything except severe pain following surgery.

Painkillers are completely appropriate for someone recovering from surgery.", "How is that help and how is \"I'm not an addict\" an insult??", "You know you don't get an award for how much pain you pointlessly endured, right?", "Your not a hero for refusing opiates. If that\u2019s what is best for you then it\u2019s best for you. But not all surgeries are the same and have the same level of pain. I\u2019ve had 5 surgeries and each one required different levels of opiate medications. Being in too much pain after surgery can actually hinder your recovery. Getting up and walking around briefly everyday after surgery is needed for recovery. Eating properly and sleeping well is needed for speedy recovery. People can\u2019t do that if they are in pain. \n\nHow can she be the only AH when her husband was trying to prevent her from accessing and taking needed medication repeatedly??? If I was in pain and I was being coerced into not taking them and having my needs continuously ignored and silenced, I would snap too.", "Drugs only become habit forming if you allow them to. I'm happy you were able to go through the pain without taking the pain killers. As I stated in my post, I have a hard enough time taking Tylenol. I don't trust 90% of medications out there. I only reached for one today due to being in excessive pain. They have been sitting here untouched otherwise. Him looking out for me can be easily sentenced to say that he is projecting. I never stated he was weak. If anything he is a very strong person for being able to overcome addiction and I've told him so several times. But him projecting what he's been through on to me was not okay.", "Maybe using an alcoholic as an example was a poor choice. \n\nI just meant that just because the SO had a problem, doesn\u2019t mean OP should be in pain.", "I\u2019m not shaming her or him - yes, what you\u2019ve said does happen. But it doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. \n\nMillions of people have taken opioids for medical reasons (myself included) and not become addicted. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to project either way. Husband is reacting from his trauma. Wife is reacting from pain and knowing herself and her personality. \n\nIt\u2019s true both ways.", "Agreed. Anyone can become addicted even when they go \"not me.\" This is not to say don't take them, just be careful.\n\nIt doesn't take much to slip", "I would be worried that your recovering addict husband is pressuring you so hard to get access to legal weed. That's just giving up one substance for another.", "My husband is in the camp where THC just makes everything worse for him. His pain level increases, his anxiety shoots through the roof. It makes him miserable. For me, it triggers my motion sickness and there's no way to stop the ride once it starts. It's just not a fun experience for either of us. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. Try just keeping them away from him and don't take them around him when you really need one. It's hard to heal when you're in pain.", "You are not the AH and neither is your husband.\n\nYou need to understand an addict POV.

Follow the rules and keep it civil.", "Not by any shape or form do I expect her to not take painkillers. However, she also ignored his reaction. Maybe trying something like ibuprofen or naprosyn. I hear his fear and concern. I get she is in pain and yes my pain was high, I just refused it.", "You don't trust 90% of medications? Yet you trust this one?  You could have taken ibuprofen or naprosyn, which are not habit forming and over the counter. Your response to him was wrong. And yes, they are super habit forming even with just the 10. Have you not noticed the epidemic of addictions in the US alone if you are in the US? I know it isn't just the US either. Even the manufacturer has admitted to it being super addictive. He is simply scared of this happening to you.", "That is absolutely correct. I also said she should keep them away and take them without letting the husband see. He is clearly not over what happened to him, his reaction doesn't come from a rational place.", "She shamed him when she snapped, \"I'm not you\".  That was a direct reference to his addiction and that she superior in being able to not become one.  She's TA.", "And didn't even voice \"not me\", she voiced \"I'm not you\" a direct you're the fuck-up that I could never be.", "You make a really good point. He's trying to talk her into taking something that increases her anxiety? Why?", "Agreed", "That's on you/her husband for reading that intention into it. She never said she was superior, just different. It doesn't make sense for her to avoid opiates like it might for her husband, just like it doesn't make sense for someone without a peanut allergy to avoid peanuts.", "Sometimes over the counter meds just aren't enough to touch it. Also there are sooo many factors that go into addiction, that it's hard to tell who will and will not fall prey to it. Hin being cautious and worries is understandable.  Him trying to talk her out of making a medical decision for herself- based on her pain level and what I will consider at this age knowing how she reacts to pulls is not okay though. Different people have different levels of pain tolerance, drug tolerance, and different usages before they become addicted.  Assuming it's a one shoe fits all situation leads to more problems than it solves. Also her taking one pill is highly unlikely to trigger an addiction - she is just now reaching for them, she didn't turn to them immediately, and she understands the risk of addiction and sounds cautious of it - all things that help.", "I\u2019m sorry but if your pain is \u201chigh\u201d, taking naproxen or ibuprofen is not enough to cover the pain. You may perceive your pain as high because it\u2019s the worst pain you\u2019ve personally experienced. Experiencing actual strong/high levels of pain cannot be managed solely with non-steroidal anti inflammatory meds or paracetamol. \n\nYou don\u2019t know how much pain she was in. You don\u2019t even know what surgery she had so also you don\u2019t know and cannot judge her pain levels and medication requirements. \n\nIt\u2019s tough being an addict and being around opiates. But he is a grown ass adult. He made his emotional reaction her problem and her fault. He is allowed to express his feelings, but he should have centred it around him acknowledging that he\u2019s feeling triggered, maybe needs to have some distance, should maybe contact/talk to someone who can help make a plan to manage his emotions. \n\nHe lashed out, didn\u2019t take responsibility for lashing out emotionally and projected his fears and anxieties onto her. It is neither acceptable or ethical.", "He reaction comes from a very rational place.  Legitimate  opioid use is the number one creator of heroin junkies.", "Just like how you called addicts \u201cjunkies\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re TA.", "Exactly. Being allergic is not a choice, and neither is being an addict.", "Legitimate use of opiates is the main creator of junkies.  What is he supposed to read into that statement?  The catalyst of his concern is his own personal experience of addiction.  But she's not him, she couldn't possibly be that weak, right?", "I would have to check the statistics, but even so his reaction was not the result of this logical conclusion. \n\nHe tensed up and tried to stop her because of his traumatic experience, it was a fight or flight response. It stemmed from fear and bad memories.\n\nI would not call it rational, but I see where you are coming from. My father took opioid medications and they did absolutely nothing on the addiction profile, but maybe the dosage here is different or the composition is. So I couldn't really say, but I know pain and I know how difficult it is to remain calm when you feel like you are being ripped apart.", "I didn't call addicts junkies.  Junkies are a specific subgroup of addicts who no longer have any control over their life other that their next fixed.  It's not a bad word.", "He tried to stop her so he could empty the garbage, find the pills, and get back on them.", "Her reaction is that of an inconsiderate AH.  Screaming, \"I'm not you\" leaves out any statistical data.  It's a personal attack where she declares herself superior.  Not nice to do to your spouse when they're voicing actual personal experiences - she lived through them to by supposedly loving him through it.", "Gosh I really hope not...", "You are underestimating what pain does to your mind. If she doesn't apologise and keep on this path, then I agree with you. She would be an inconsiderate AH.\n\nIn that moment I tend to believe all she could think of is getting rid of the pain and she perceived his opposition in a more aggressive way than it probably was.", "But on the flip side, trying to impose your opinion on someone else and essentially attempting to say \u2018I know better than you.\u2019 (Especially to another adult) is demeaning and ignoring that she is a grown adult who can make her own choices. \n\nIf he had said at the beginning, I don\u2019t like this, and then left it, her actions would be that of an AH. But he didn\u2019t, he continued to try and dictate to her what she should do to manage her pain. His comfort does not supersede her physical pain. \n\nShe pointed out a fact, bluntly but a fact nonetheless. She is not him. He should not assume her experience will be the same as his. Was that a hurtful thing to say, probably, but how much must it hurt to know your partner would rather see you in pain to soothe their feelings.", "Plus she was doing everything right to minimize the risks of addiction. She filled the script but went with milder, safer painkillers first to see if that would be enough and only resorted to the opioid when the tylenol didn't cut it. Probably she was aiming to only take enough to take the edge off, and continue to try tylenol first.\n\nShe has been entirely responsible so I can see being annoyed when the second she decides that actually, that's too much pain, the husband swoops in and treats her like she's an irresponsible child, WHILE she's in a lot of pain."]}
