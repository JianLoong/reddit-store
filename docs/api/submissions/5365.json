First, he is simply looking out for you. Your comeback sucks and you are basically saying he's weak. Horrible!\n\n I, too, had surgery and was given the 10 pills, but I refused them because they can still cause addiction. It isn't about prone to addiction, drugs can be habit forming because they affect your brain. I told Dr. not to give me Rx, but it wound up coming home with me. I refused them as much pain I was in. I dropped them off at the pharmacy medical box after removing the label to have it destroyed once I recovered.

He doesn't want to have what happened to him happen to you.  You don't have to be in pain and follow his advice, but don't lash out at someone and use their past vindictively when all they are doing is trying to protect you and themselves from further harm.  Don't leave pain killers somewhere that he can see or have access to them in any way.

I\u2019ve had 5 surgeries and each one required different levels of opiate medications. Being in too much pain after surgery can actually hinder your recovery. Getting up and walking around briefly everyday after surgery is needed for recovery. Eating properly and sleeping well is needed for speedy recovery.

I only reached for one today due to being in excessive pain. They have been sitting here untouched otherwise. Him looking out for me can be easily sentenced to say that he is projecting.

He's trying to talk her into taking something that increases her anxiety? Why?", "Agreed", "That's on you/her husband for reading that intention into it. She never said she was superior, just different. It doesn't make sense for her to avoid opiates like it might for her husband, just like it doesn't make sense for someone without a peanut allergy to avoid peanuts.", "Sometimes over the counter meds just aren't enough to touch it. Also there are sooo many factors that go into addiction, that it's hard to tell who will and will not fall prey to it. Hin being cautious and worries is understandable.  Him trying to talk her out of making a medical decision for herself- based on her pain level and what I will consider at this age knowing how she reacts to pulls is not okay though. Different people have different levels of pain tolerance, drug tolerance, and different usages before they become addicted.  Assuming it's a one shoe fits all situation leads to more problems than it solves. Also her taking one pill is highly unlikely to trigger an addiction - she is just now reaching for them, she didn't turn to them immediately, and she understands the risk of addiction and sounds cautious of it - all things that help.", "I\u2019m sorry but if your pain is \u201chigh\u201d, taking naproxen or ibuprofen is not enough to cover the pain.

It stemmed from fear and bad memories.\n\nI would not call it rational, but I see where you are coming from. My father took opioid medications and they did absolutely nothing on the addiction profile, but maybe the dosage here is different or the composition is. So I couldn't really say, but I know pain and I know how difficult it is to remain calm when you feel like you are being ripped apart.", "I didn't call addicts junkies.

If she doesn't apologise and keep on this path, then I agree with you.

But he didn\u2019t, he continued to try and dictate to her what she should do to manage her pain. His comfort does not supersede her physical pain. \n\nShe pointed out a fact, bluntly but a fact nonetheless. She is not him. He should not assume her experience will be the same as his. Was that a hurtful thing to say, probably, but how much must it hurt to know your partner would rather see you in pain to soothe their feelings.", "Plus she was doing everything right to minimize the risks of addiction. She filled the script but went with milder, safer painkillers first to see if that would be enough and only resorted to the opioid when the tylenol didn't cut it. Probably she was aiming to only take enough to take the edge off, and continue to try tylenol first.\n\nShe has been entirely responsible so I can see being annoyed when the second she decides that actually, that's too much pain, the husband swoops in and treats her like she's an irresponsible child, WHILE she's in a lot of pain.", "Nta.  As someone who just detoxed from pot it can be addictive.

Bottom line it took almost two days to get a prescription (because I did not want to go to the ER and face those charges).\n\nMost surgeons will tell their patients that you NEED to take pain killers at least a few times post-surgery, because if a body is in pain, it will not heal. OP is not the AH for trying to explain this to her husband.\n\nAlso, marijuana isn't great for pain relief as a rule after surgery - had this discussion with several doctors and surgeons.", "That's actually not what opioid means. \"Opioid\" drugs bind to the opioid receptors in the brain, the same receptors that opium binds.

And I say that as someone who has been given opioids after several large surgeries and been fine, but only ever smoked opium once because once was enough to tell me why people liked it so much.

No comparison.", "I take opiate painkillers daily for the last 15 years for a chronic illness. I had to stop for 5 days for a procedure this year and it was hellish. I had my chronic pain and I definitely had opiate withdrawal and that very specific \u2018bone pain.\u2019 I am dependent on opiates but not addicted.\n\nAt no point in those 5 days did I do anything to try to excuse taking them, beyond that period nothing about my usage interferes with my behaviour, lifestyle or causes interpersonal issues. I don\u2019t think about ways to obtain them, up the dose, lie etc. I just have a standing reminder to order them monthly as they only issue 28 days at a time. I sometimes take less if not needed so I have a couple extra for flares.\n\nDependency and addiction are different things and addiction to opiates partially depends on how you metabolise it. Until synthetic opoids became common about a third of people lack the liver function to get an effect at all, about a third can develop addiction and the rest can get dependent but also therefore its common for people to go from surgery, hospitalisations and serious illnesses using morphine or fentanyl a lot and stop almost immediately if they have not had incorrect dosing. Generally giving people too strong an opiate and letting them pick the dosage times is a huge risk factor to addiction but there is almost always underlying issue too such as ongoing pain, things they want to numb out etc but just taking opiates isn\u2019t in itself a slippery slope. It needs a lot of factors.\n\nFunnily enough I react very badly to weed. I\u2019ve tried it for pain relief and get none. It makes me brain foggy, impacts my daily living with a heavy paranoid feel and I almost never get a good result medically or recreationally. It also makes me eat more which as my pain is gut related worsens my condition and lacks the magic of opiates in \u2018constipating\u2019 me as I have chronic diarrhoea.\n\nI have lots of friends who thrive on weed for pain or anti anxiety meds but who don\u2019t evangelise. I don\u2019t suggest my opiates so I get frustrated by people who push weed. I have PTSD and know it fucks with it and hate having to explain my medical history just because of other people\u2019s feelings about certain medications.\n\nI\u2019m also quite wary of anyone with a former substance addiction who stand heavily for weed as I\u2019ve noticed so many people just switch addiction and don\u2019t deal with the underlying issues. But because it is seen as benign, it\u2019s ok to push it in a way we would rightly judge if it was opiates or alcohol or other drugs.\n\nBut everyone reacts differently to things and that alone should be respected. I am not good with certain synthetic opiates but old school from the poppy stuff works really well. My BF would be looping the loop on one paracetamol and codeine from the pharmacy. He reacts well to weed. I also react horribly to SSRI and SNRIs  but am not against them.

Gambling, sex, porn all fall under that umbrella.   \n\n\nCannabis can be addictive for addictive personalities. That kind of insistence on it makes it sound like he's traded one addiction for another.   \n\n\nYes. I am a regular cannabis user for chronic pain. But I wouldn't recommend it for short term pain if someone can manage it with opiates without fear of addiction because cannabis is more easily available and it's something that can be used socially in a lot more settings.   \n\n\nHonestly, for severe pain, I prefer pain killers because they don't fog me up as badly as the amount of cannabis I'd have to take for that kind of pain and I know I can take them safely.", "NA is probably the reason he's so pushy about this to begin with, they train you to see your own addiction in everyone around you", "Lol @ OP\u2019s title. \u201cSomeone\u201d told me not to take a certain med, like I thought OP meant a co-worker or something \ud83d\ude02", "Good point, but do consider he may be in some kind of pain just being around the pills.
