But if it isn't working then another direction is probably called for with that child. If you are being recalcitrant to change and adapt because it worked for one but not the other you certainly could be straying into AH territory.", "NTA. I think this is a fantastic idea and you should write a book about teaching kids to find and fix things that need finding and fixing. Your husband is the ass. Mental load is a fact of life, the kids had better get used to it. The 12-year-old may be just a little too young, but with support and talking about it, he'll get there. For example, maybe he can start thinking about cooking: what ingredients are available and what he can do with them for everybody.", "NTA - This is an age appropriate expectation.", "NTA, I\u2019ve saved this post as an idea for when I have kids (as someone who does at some point down the road want to be a dad), but I also notice the sexes of the people involved, and not wanting to come across as an AH by making sweeping statements, BUT anecdotally, I find dudes do simply not care as much about a bit of clutter, I certainly don\u2019t. One thing you could edit in the phrasing of the task is instead of saying find a chore to do (which invites the notion that there may not be anything he feels needs to be done), tell him to do a chore that would make you/his sister/family etc happy. It changes the perspective from \u201cI don\u2019t see anything here that needs to be done for me to function in this house\u201d towards \u201cI need to find something that\u2019ll make everyone around me more comfortable\u201d. You sound like someone with a really great perspective on parenting, so I wouldn\u2019t worry long term, just keep pushing your kids towards being the best people they can be", "NTA.  My kid is younger than yours and helps with vacuuming cause he hates cat hair being everywhere", "I think this is genius!!! I am going to try it with my oldest. Edited to change to YTA!!! You said your child has a hard time making decisions. This means your child has a problem with executive functioning and these tasks are excruciatingly difficult. You set him up for failure.", "NAH--you tried to create a good way for your kids to problem solve when they are old enough to handle that type of task. Your son got overwhelmed by this and couldn't view it through the lense you have. Some increased communication (tell him the why behind this exercise) will likely do the trick.", "At this point, I\u2019d say NAH, but feel like it could stray into y t a if you keep pushing it and he just doesn\u2019t catch on.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty vague instruction, and I feel like results will vary depending on what each person\u2019s standard of cleanliness is. And if you have a specific standard that you want them to achieve, then you should be more specific about what needs done around the house. It could be that he simply doesn\u2019t interpret anything in the house as needing done because it already fits his personal interpretation of \u201cclean\u201d.", "NTA. I am curious who did the bulk of the household chores and cleaning etc when your husband was younger.... he might not see the value if he didn't do a lot himself. \n \nIt's a neat idea for sure and will definitely help your kids have that initiative and independence when they're older and living alone or with others!", "NTA \n\nWith the information that you\u2019ve given I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole as long as you\u2019re not forcing this on your younger child when he gets overwhelmed and actually working through whatever the issue may be. Seems like he just needs a little help in finding a task to take on the first time and maybe it will be easier the next time. \n\nWhy exactly is your husband against \u201cmental load\u201d chores. I actually think your idea is nice? It allows the kids to have some choice in the chores they do.", "NTA.  This is a hugely valuable life skill, and will help to fend off 'weaponized incompetence'.  But different people do see things differently.   Instead of having him write a list about what could be cleaned in the living room, did you try doing a walkthrough of the living room and making it a discussion?  Having examples pointed out could make it easier for him.  The magazines are scattered across the table, stack them.  There's dust in the corners, vacuum.  The shoes are spread across the entryway, put them in the shoe rack, etc.", "It's a nice skill-set to possess.  One I didn't possess until I was well into my late 20s, too.\n\nWith that said?  It can be a struggle to learn, so be kind to your 12 year-old as he works through the difficulty.  This skill is much, much more difficult for certain people to grasp, and it can absolutely be overwhelming if your son has displayed some neuro-divergent tendencies in the past.  And of course explain your line of thinking to your husband, who may have a different outlook on non-specific chore assignments for young learners.  NAH.", "NTA.  Your husband sounds like a bad parent.  You're trying to teach your kids valuable life skills, and he's undermining you. If I were in your position, I would modify the exercise a little bit.  If your son doesn't come up with his own chore, think of the most unpleasant chore that remains and assign it to him. Just make sure it's something useful and not some busy work that you're inventing as a punishment. Eventually he'll come up with alternatives on his own.", "NTA - providing structure and the tools for self sufficiency is the role of a parent, so long as it\u2019s nurturing and with patience.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything here that says otherwise. Sounds like your husband got frustrated with a fussy kid and took it out on you.", "NAH- I applaud the idea in theory and I like the suggestion of having a photo of a clean room so that there can be a comparison for the kids to help them identify things needing cleaned. That said, there will always be differences in standards among multiple people. So what you consider a chore needing to be done, another grown and capable adult might not even consider or feel is necessary. Your children are going to be different as are you and your husband so there will always be a difference in how one views a potential chore. \nI am working on helping my husband bridge the metal load gap and have noticed that what bugs him about a space in our home isn\u2019t what I would think is a priority and what bothers me he can easily over look. There has to be some form of communication of an agreed upon standard for this to work smoothly. I suggest not only the photos of an acceptably clean room but also a family discussion of the types of things you do without being asked that they can begin to try and notice. Allow them some time to grow into noticing these things. It make take your 12 year old two to three times longer to make the connections your daughter made near instantly", "NTA\u2014 and thanks for posting! I am initiating this TODAY!!", "Why are they only cleaning up after themselves at 12?", "NTA and I find it \"funny\" that your son is struggling and your husband is pissed. The mental load disproportionately falls on women and girls but girls aren't born knowing how to do it. They're taught and conditioned by their families and by society. I would die on this hill with your husband. Continue teaching and expecting this of all your children but make sure you're tailoring your lessons in ways that each child learns best so it doesn't become a negative that they rebel against.", "NTA because I think your heart is in the right place and you just want your kids to build a good habits. \n\nThe only concern I have is that it doesn\u2019t sound like your son has been given much in the way of training or instruction about how to complete this self-directed chore. Let\u2019s face it, a 12yo has standards of cleanliness that don\u2019t always line up with the adult world. He legitimately might not understand how to identify something that needs to be cleaned/tidied/etc, or he might even just be struggling with the idea that chores can be more than just something that someone tells you to do. \n\nIt really shouldn\u2019t matter that the oldest kid was able to pick this up quickly; all kids are unique and need different kinds of support. For instance, it\u2019s theoretically possible that your son is neurodivergent and would respond better to direct, specific instruction. You *would* be an AH if you insist that your way is the only way to approach this issue.", "NTA. My youngest is also 12 and he is perfectly capable of performing the chores you described, including making an independent assessment and decision to choose a chore that needs doing. \n\nHowever, that being said, does your 12 year old actually have prior experience with doing some of these tasks, or seeing his parents do them? Is it possible he's just completely ignorant of some of the things that get done regularly to maintain a clean house? Does he know where to find the cleaning supplies? Could you not prepare a generic list of ideas of things that need to be done around the house periodically? Vacuuming, wash/put away dishes, clean windows, clean toilets, clean the sinks, etc. \n\nIn my experience, children this age can get very frustrated when they feel like they're asked to do something, but aren't given enough direction to know how to do it. Just expecting them to \"figure it out\" is a dick move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
