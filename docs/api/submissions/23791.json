I think this is a fantastic idea and you should write a book about teaching kids to find and fix things that need finding and fixing. Your husband is the ass. Mental load is a fact of life, the kids had better get used to it. The 12-year-old may be just a little too young, but with support and talking about it, he'll get there. For example, maybe he can start thinking about cooking: what ingredients are available and what he can do with them for everybody.", "NTA - This is an age appropriate expectation.", "NTA, I\u2019ve saved this post as an idea for when I have kids (as someone who does at some point down the road want to be a dad), but I also notice the sexes of the people involved, and not wanting to come across as an AH by making sweeping statements, BUT anecdotally, I find dudes do simply not care as much about a bit of clutter, I certainly don\u2019t. One thing you could edit in the phrasing of the task is instead of saying find a chore to do (which invites the notion that there may not be anything he feels needs to be done), tell him to do a chore that would make you/his sister/family etc happy. It changes the perspective from \u201cI don\u2019t see anything here that needs to be done for me to function in this house\u201d towards \u201cI need to find something that\u2019ll make everyone around me more comfortable\u201d.

And if you have a specific standard that you want them to achieve, then you should be more specific about what needs done around the house. It could be that he simply doesn\u2019t interpret anything in the house as needing done because it already fits his personal interpretation of \u201cclean\u201d.", "NTA.

But different people do see things differently.   Instead of having him write a list about what could be cleaned in the living room, did you try doing a walkthrough of the living room and making it a discussion?  Having examples pointed out could make it easier for him.  The magazines are scattered across the table, stack them.  There's dust in the corners, vacuum.

It can be a struggle to learn, so be kind to your 12 year-old as he works through the difficulty.  This skill is much, much more difficult for certain people to grasp, and it can absolutely be overwhelming if your son has displayed some neuro-divergent tendencies in the past.  And of course explain your line of thinking to your husband, who may have a different outlook on non-specific chore assignments for young learners.  NAH.", "NTA.  Your husband sounds like a bad parent.  You're trying to teach your kids valuable life skills, and he's undermining you. If I were in your position, I would modify the exercise a little bit.  If your son doesn't come up with his own chore, think of the most unpleasant chore that remains and assign it to him. Just make sure it's something useful and not some busy work that you're inventing as a punishment. Eventually he'll come up with alternatives on his own.", "NTA - providing structure and the tools for self sufficiency is the role of a parent, so long as it\u2019s nurturing and with patience.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything here that says otherwise.

That said, there will always be differences in standards among multiple people. So what you consider a chore needing to be done, another grown and capable adult might not even consider or feel is necessary. Your children are going to be different as are you and your husband so there will always be a difference in how one views a potential chore. \nI am working on helping my husband bridge the metal load gap and have noticed that what bugs him about a space in our home isn\u2019t what I would think is a priority and what bothers me he can easily over look. There has to be some form of communication of an agreed upon standard for this to work smoothly. I suggest not only the photos of an acceptably clean room but also a family discussion of the types of things you do without being asked that they can begin to try and notice. Allow them some time to grow into noticing these things. It make take your 12 year old two to three times longer to make the connections your daughter made near instantly", "NTA\u2014 and thanks for posting! I am initiating this TODAY!!", "Why are they only cleaning up after themselves at 12?", "NTA and I find it \"funny\" that your son is struggling and your husband is pissed. The mental load disproportionately falls on women and girls but girls aren't born knowing how to do it. They're taught and conditioned by their families and by society. I would die on this hill with your husband. Continue teaching and expecting this of all your children but make sure you're tailoring your lessons in ways that each child learns best so it doesn't become a negative that they rebel against.", "NTA because I think your heart is in the right place and you just want your kids to build a good habit. \n\nThe only concern I have is that it doesn\u2019t sound like your son has been given much in the way of training or instruction about how to complete this self-directed chore. You should spend at least a few weeks explicitly modeling the behaviors for him. Let\u2019s face it, a 12yo will have standards of cleanliness that don\u2019t always line up with the adult world. He legitimately might not understand how to identify something that needs to be cleaned/tidied/etc, or he might even be struggling with the very idea that chores can be more than just something that someone tells you to do. \n\nIt really shouldn\u2019t matter that the oldest kid was able to pick this up quickly; all kids are unique and need different kinds of support. For instance, it\u2019s theoretically possible that your son is neurodivergent and would respond better to direct, specific instruction. You *would* be an AH if you insist that your way is the only way to approach this issue.", "NTA. My youngest is also 12 and he is perfectly capable of performing the chores you described, including making an independent assessment and decision to choose a chore that needs doing. \n\nHowever, that being said, does your 12 year old actually have prior experience with doing some of these tasks, or seeing his parents do them? Is it possible he's just completely ignorant of some of the things that get done regularly to maintain a clean house? Does he know where to find the cleaning supplies? Could you not prepare a generic list of ideas of things that need to be done around the house periodically? Vacuuming, wash/put away dishes, clean windows, clean toilets, clean the sinks, etc. \n\nIn my experience, children this age can get very frustrated when they feel like they're asked to do something, but aren't given enough direction to know how to do it.

Obviously if it\u2019s overwhelming him you should try to work with him to make it a little easier, but the problem is it\u2019s difficult and uncomfortable by very nature, at least to him, and making it less so kinda undermines the ability cope with difficult situations. \n\nMy inexpert suggestion would be to make it clear that this is a task he has to do and he won\u2019t get help with it, but that you know he\u2019s capable of it and it\u2019s fine to just start small with picking little things up or putting stuff that\u2019s sitting out back where it belongs. \n\nThis is an awesome parenting technique that you shouldn\u2019t give up on. Tell your husband that it\u2019s a vital skill to figure out and having him work through it now, even if it\u2019s hard, BECAUSE it\u2019s hard even, will save him so much trouble in the future.", "NTA but there might be an issue with personal thresholds here if we assume this is a legitimate issue he\u2019s having.\n\nWhat one person would view as a mess, another person might view as acceptable and yet another person might view as tidy.\n\nAs a result, if everything seems to pass your own personal threshold, you\u2019re going to struggle to find something to do. I personally like things organised, but that drives some people insane because I barely even register if something is dusty. Then when I visit a few friends houses, they tell me they cleaned up and I\u2019m shocked and want to ask which house they cleaned because it clearly isn\u2019t the one I\u2019m looking at.\n\nSo if he really can\u2019t find something that needs organising, because it all looks fine to him, it becomes a really frustrating puzzle of trying to work out what someone else is thinking of as a mess. That\u2019s something very doable, but it\u2019s going to need some input on your part to learn that skill and brute forcing it by just randomly redoing tasks to see if that was the right answer isn\u2019t the most productive way to do it. \n\nWhen I was younger, before I realised that some people really hate dust, if my gran had just said the room was filthy and to clean it, I\u2019d have been confused and annoyed too, because all I\u2019d be thinking is \u2018clean what? it all looks fine\u2019 but once I was told it was about dust, I knew to look for that.", "He is 12.

I found out leading them down the path with one simple question after another helped them process a little at a time and not become overwhelmed.  You may have to spread it out over several lessons.  Lesson 1 - go look at the chore chart for ideas.  Looking at the chore chart for ideas is not cheating.  What sort of chores does it show?  Discuss that sometimes chores that need to be done are obvious such as laundry that needs to be folded.  Some are less obvious such as the carpet may not look dirty from just looking at it on the floor, but if you look closer you may see hair or dust and needs vacuuming.  Just an idea...", "Info: What sort of scaffolding are you doing when teaching this skill?", "NTA. And speaking on behalf of their future life partners, I thank you.", "NTA.", "NTA, and bless you. I wish more people raised their kids (specifically sons) this way.\n\nI do agree that he might need a little help figuring it out. \"Does this look clean? What do you think clean looks like? How are some other ways you can tell (smell, feel, etc.). Why do you think it is important to keep things clean? What kind of cleaning do you like, if any? What do you really dislike?\" Ask in a friendly and engaging way.", "NTA. Honestly, I really love this as a chore and a teaching lesson. As long as you\u2019re not piling up the chores to where the kids do every household task I think it is very reasonable. I like that it can be as simple as wiping down a counter or as big as reorganizing the whole room. This teaches them they are responsible for their living situation and in correlation their own lives. I believe it can even help with creativity because for so much of a child\u2019s life they are just looking for orders as to what to do next. Maybe to help him learn more about this you can make an example of what he decides to do with his time like wether he decides to play outside or play video games, he saw it and wanted to do it and try to correlate that to doing a small chore just like finding something to fill your time. \n\nOn a personal note, I think it\u2019s especially important for men to learn this, as many men in my life cannot for the life of me understand that they can deviate from the clear instructions. I\u2019m talking about things like going to the grocery store because they saw we were low on a few items and just knew to do it without being told to do it or have someone else make the list for them. This is a great lesson in competency.", "NTA and really your husband is part of the problem.\n\nBut another way may be picking a room where you know there is something less obvious to be done and do some visualizing of the end result with him. What does a clean room or even area in a room looks like? Then go into the room and have him pick out the things that are out of place from that vision and fix those.\n\nThen next time he does it himself. Brain development is weird and maybe your daughter's ability to make those visualizations have developed earlier than your son's have. taking a step back and teaching him the building blocks of how to make those connextions from small mess to clean room will give better results.", "NTA.  If I asked my son that at 12, he'd have found nothing that needed to be done.  Ask you son to write a list of the things he thinks you and his father do instead, see if he even has a concept of how things are done in the home.\nMade me think of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_kXIGvB1uU", "NTA. Ya gotta teach the boy how to be a man capable of keeping a home.", "NTA and I love this idea for my own son!", "NTA.\n\nIt great practice to work on the skill of looking around and picking something independently and taking care of it. I think it\u2019s an awesome idea.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s a really hard one, so having some support in place to make it easier would be good. Maybe sit down with him once a week and help him brainstorm ideas and write them down so he knows he has a back up list if he can\u2019t think of something on the day. \n\nMaybe do a few weeks where you write options on cards and he can pick a card each day. (So he can practice making the choice, but from a limited pool of options) \n\nOr have your chore list available so he can help you with something on it, or steal one. \n\nI think it\u2019s a great idea, but he may need some help bootstrapping into it.", "I could go either way. I'll err on the side of NTA for that alone but... have you tried walking around /with/ him, listing things you see, and askinf which he might like to tackle?\n\nDo this enough times, and maybe he'll start to know what to look for. \n\nDoing this on the weekend vs a school night might also help; could be that he's already mentally burndd out from school and just needs proper modeling on wyat to do, ratyer than being told to \"figure it out yourself\".\n\nAnother approach might be to ask him which chores he finds easiest, and then prompting him to check if those need to be done out-of-turn, if he just needs an easy win to get the idea.\n\nEdit: typo and grammar", "NTA\n\nThis is a perfectly fine rule that teaches your children to be self-directed, observant, and proactive.\n\nYour husband really should back you up on this. There's literally nothing wrong with what you're doing. You might want to have a little sit down with your son, but overall this is fine.", "Your kids are lucky - this is a great skill that many adults never learn", "NTA.\n\nIf he's having a hard time, give him specific things to look for:\n\nIs it dusty?\n\nAre there things in the room that don't generally belong in the room?\n\nAre there empty plates/cups around?\n\nHow's the trash look?\n\nAre there fingerprints on the windows?\n\nEveryone here immediately suggesting ADHD clearly have no idea how kids work.", "NTA - This sounds like a really helpful way to teach life skills, but your son might need more of a bridge. Instead of throwing him in the deep end, maybe show him a room and ask him? Try to make it not so stressful and let him know that it's okay if he doesn't see anything right away. You can also point out what you think should be done so he learns to recognize it.", "I\u2019m not implying your son has a neurodivergence but as someone who is AuDHD, I require more detailed instruction and as a kid, I didn\u2019t see things that needed to be done without a lot of help. I think that\u2019s where your son might be struggling. Maybe he just needs some examples on a sheet to get him started? You\u2019re NTA here but I think you need to adjust your approach.", "NTA and I love this approach. Learning to be proactive will serve him well in relationships and at work.", "NTA that\u2019s not what mental load means", "They could also make a list of what they have cleaned before, remember mom telling them to do, remember mom doing etc and then think through whether these things need to be done right now. They could think through a list of areas in the house where they spend the most time (and therefore make the most mess) and what is required to get that area spotless. I bet if they stand there looking at their desk and ask themselves how to get it into a parent-approved state they could think of something!\n\nAlso it sounds like the husband needs the \u2018think about what needs to be cleanedz\u2019 COE assignment too", "That's a major issue I've run into with me mum over the years.\n\n'You didn't hoover the living room'\n\n.... 'yes I did'\n\n'Well why didnt you hoover the cabinets?!'\n\n'Who the feck hoovers cabinets?!'", "There problem with that is that different people have different standards of cleanliness. Every single time I've seen the argument of \"mental load\" used, it came down to \"why don't you read my mind and defer to how I want things\". Your magazine example is great for that, because I'm willing to bet every other person wouldn't give a shit, and you be replicating this exact debate if the first person insists.", "That's a great suggestion. It's great op is teaching him this and I think it will workout great with a small bit of coaching. If he is struggling what to choose he might just need a little more direction as to what constitutes needing tidying up and what doesn't count as a chore. He may be wondering to himself does it count as a chore if perse he just straightened the couch cushions when maybe his sister decided to vacuum the whole living room. I know for me it can be hard because I'll have a mental list in my head of what I'm going to do for cleaning and it turns out my SO already did half of it or all of it already and now I'm thrown off.", "Another good idea is to make slips of paper with a chore written on them. If he can't come up with an idea on his own, he simply picks from the jar of chore slips.", "Absolutely, this is such a valuable lesson. Although currently challenging for your son it will be to his longterm benefit and the benefit of any future partner of his as well. \n\nI was never taught how to see messes, when it came to cleaning my mom would tell me \"just do it, and then it's done.\" My dad actually showed me how to do whatever task he was asking of me. I still struggle with cleaning and now that I have a young child I'm trying to actually TEACH him how to clean up his toys by breaking it down into smaller steps. \n\nSometimes the goal is to just find all the toys and put them all on the coffee table. Then the next day we'll organize everything into piles based on theme/where it goes (toy food, toy cars, stuffed animals, etc...) and then finally put it away. I don't know if this is the best method  but I'm trying to break it down so it isn't so overwhelming. Keyword, *TRYING*.", "YAAAAAS SAY IT AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!!!!! \n\nNTA OP", "Ok but if OP\u2019s kid really has no other symptoms of adhd other than being indecisive, why would they have him tested?", "Having a meltdown over inability to make a choice isn't simple indecisiveness. He's missing a core skill of some kind. Could be issues with perfectionism, distress tolerance, executive function, parsing vague instructions...\n\nIt's not unreasonable to suggest professional help for identifying what the root problem is at this point.", "It\u2019s an age appropriate task.
