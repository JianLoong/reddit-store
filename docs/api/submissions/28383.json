We\u2019re going to Orlando. It\u2019s me, my parents (47F + 45M) my sister (25F) and her husband (25M). For some context, my parents are paying for this trip for our WHOLE family, including my sister and her husband, this is a trip I\u2019ve been promised since I was 3, and I have issues with drinking, which is important for this story.\n\nI do not drink. This is for a combination of reasons, but mainly has to do with my family. My dad is 100% an in denial alcoholic. He\u2019s lost his job before as a result of this, gotten arrested twice, had numerous fights with my mom (which I had to witness at a young age, leaving me with permanent issues), and drunk driving with me in the car, both when I was a minor and an adult.  My sister and mom aren\u2019t as bad, but they both have a habit of being mean when they\u2019re drunk. Since it\u2019s my 21st birthday, my family wants to do drinking around the world at Epcot. Again, I do not drink, but I have a feeling they are going to pressure me in to doing it. \n\nThat brings me to the topic. I really, really, do not want my family to get drunk for this trip. Since it\u2019s my birthday trip, I have a feeling it will just stress me out if they\u2019re drunk, and cause me to lock myself in my room and not enjoy the trip at all. So, I approached them asking if they could avoid getting drunk (still be able to drink, just avoid getting plastered). My sister got pissed about this saying she\u2019s \u201can adult\u201d and my dad got annoyed because he\u2019s \u201cpaying for the trip\u201d (which I get). \n\nI just want to know, AITA?\n\nEdit: I am not TELLING them not to get drunk, I am asking if they could avoid getting unreasonably intoxicated to the point it causes issues.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ll give some more context into the issues with my father drinking (as this is the person I\u2019m most concerned with getting drunk on the trip), my father has a history of being a threat to my own life while drunk. I have asked for over ten years for him to get help, and he has not. He has never once prioritized me over his drink. This includes my safety and my life.", "created_utc": 1696632703, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171qblf/aita_for_asking_my_family_not_to_get_drunk_on/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know it sucks growing up as the child of an alcoholic, because everything you just described was my childhood.\n\nKeep in mind that alcoholism, like every other addiction, is a disease, and one that is not easily controlled. If you can, avoid them when they start getting drunk & belligerent.\n\n I will guarantee to you, that if they start something in the parks, security will have them removed and most likely banned for the duration of your visit.", "NTA, but probably wont have much success with this. However what you could do instead of \"lock yourself in your room\" if it gets too much is just go outside and have some fun on your own?", "OP, I feel so sorry for you reading this post. \n\nThe thing is, sounds like pretty much every one in your family has a drinking problem and they aren't in a place where they're ready to deal with that. They've been arrested, lost jobs, been abusive, had drunk driving episodes. What a nightmare. And they continue to abuse alcohol. They see this trip as a great opportunity to drink. So you saying you don't want anyone drinking on your family vacation is not going to be taken well. They are going to drink. They are going to get drunk. They have already stated they plan to do plenty of drinking while there, despite it being DISNEY where they are plenty of other things to do.\n\nYou have choices. If you don't want to be around them and their behavior, you can choose not to go. I would definitely make this choice if you feel you will be unsafe or if one of them will be driving at any point. You can also go, have some good memories, some bad. But what I think you can't do is accept a trip your parents are paying for and set conditions. They have a substance abuse problem they are not dealing with. This is what it looks like. I'm so sorry.", "OP, You do realize that it is unrealistic to expect your family to remain sober or moderate their alcohol consumption when they are heavy drinkers planning a drinking party. \n\nIt appears that your options are to forgo the trip,  make plans for other activities & skip the drunken world tour, or go and likely feel trapped and harassed. Your call. NTA for asking, but I suspect you won't like the answer.", "NTA - Perfectly reasonable to ask. I think you need to come up with a plan B though where you can still enjoy yourself in case they do get drunk. There are a lot of great things you can do there on your own. Don\u2019t give your family the power to ruin your trip.", "NTA, you\u2019re legit just asking. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re hiding the goddamn alcohol from them.", "YTA because you are ignoring the option of not going on the trip.\n\nYour sister is right that everyone in this story is an adult. Adults get to make their own decisions, including bad decisions. If they want to drink, they can drink. If they want to get hammered, it's their right to get hammered. If you don't like it, you don't have to like it. If you want to avoid it, the only way to 100% guarantee it is to not go.", "NTA. They're right; they're not obliged to stay sober. But then, you're not obligated to remain in their presence if/when they do.\n\nHave a Plan B, like an Uber app installed on your phone, for when it happens. That way, you can go back to the hotel without them driving. \n\nSee if you can bring a non-drinking friend so that you have someone to enjoy the place with.", "NTA\n\nThey may be paying, but it is a birthday gift for you.  Giving someone a gift that you know will make them unhappy is unkind and AH, a burden rather than a kindness.\n\nI suspect this trip was set for your 21st birthday ***because*** they enjoy drinking, and thought that you could now drink with them, and wouldn't complain or object.  And be prepared for a lot of pressure to drink on this trip \"because you're finally 21 and can legally drink!\" \n\nUnfortunately, if they are truly alcoholic, addicted to alcohol, asking them to drink but not get drunk likely won't work.  Addictions are too powerful.\n\nYou can either accept this gift, knowing that they will drink and won't stop for your sake, or decline the gift.  Would it be possible for you to bring a friend who doesn't drink, so the two of you could do something else whenever your family gets to drinking?\n\nYou can tell them that if they give you this gift, you will not be drinking, and if they choose to \"drink around the world\" you will go somewhere else.  They don't have to go with you, but you won't stick around because they care more about using your birthday as an excuse for them to drink than about spending it with you doing the things you will enjoy.  Grab a monorail, go to an entirely different section of the park. \n\nYou aren't obliged to accept a gift you know will make you miserable.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThey need treatment.  Real treatment, scientifically proven. Unfortunately, the most common treatments in the US are AA and similar things that treat addiction as a vice rather than a medical condition.  AA doesn't track records at all, due to the emphasis on anonymity, and many other programs only track for a short time, maybe a year, and they don't do things that are a necessary part of scientific testing, such as double blind studies.  \n\nThe only treatment I've heard of that's been tested with placebo is nalmefene, which has been tested in Finland with people taking it (or a placebo) right before drinking.  It takes away the euphoria reaction to alcohol, so you don't get the addictive feedback loop. People can still drink, but with the medication, they don't get the biological feedback that leads to heavy binge drinking.", "NTA and ugh who would want the trauma of this kind of \"gift\"? In your place, I might decline altogether, or at least try to avoid time spent with them. *\"Have a great day, see you all later tonight back at the hotel!\"* \n\nI mean, really, they're using your 21st birthday party to (likely) celebrate with excessive alcohol for everyone against your wishes.", "NTA. My father was an alcoholic as well, so I can sympathize with how you feel. And, considering that it is your birthday trip, you can certainly ask. Unfortunately, as you just discovered, asking an alcoholic not to get drunk (not even asking them not to drink) will make them get hostile (been there, done that, got the tee-shirt).", "My mother was an alcoholic for years...and if I acted displeased with her being drunk, she'd make a scene and tell others in our party how I was mad she was was drinking like I was the biggest jerk in the world and completely unreasonable.   It absolutely sucked.\n\nYou are 100% NTA.   I have three kids of my own now, the oldest is your age, and they have never, ever seen me drunk. I have a glass or two of wine once in a while, but never to that point.  My husband is the same.  I still remember that sick feeling I'd get in the pit of my stomach when she was all out of control.  And my kids have told me about their friends having to deal with stuff like that and hating it.\n\nBut, sadly, I don't think you asking will change their behavior.   Can you convince them to let you bring a friend, so the two of you can go off on your own while they drink?\n\nHonestly, Disney is too much money to waste getting wasted.", "You ARE NOT THE AH!!! You are wanting people to change their behaviors and be something other than what they are. They won\u2019t. They will get drunk and do the same old stuff they\u2019ve always done, if you\u2019re ok with that go. If you aren\u2019t DONT GO! Enjoy a low key birthday free of alcohol and drama.", "You are being foolish for thinking that something as insignificant as \"your birthday\" or \"your enjoyment\" would trump getting hammered at a family theme park\n\nSo selfish of you to not think of all those poor $15 beers that are just begging to be drunk! So much more important than your silly milestone\n\nWhy shouldn't Dad embarrass you in public yet again? After all, he's paying \n\nNTA but I wouldn't go on the trip if I was you", "YTA. If you don\u2019t like people drinking, don\u2019t go on vacation with people who drink. If your dad is an actual alcoholic, he can\u2019t just switch it off.", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t go on the trip. No matter what happens they\u2019re going to get drunk and you\u2019re not going to have a good 21st birthday. Stay home and do something with your friends.", "YTA - unfortunately if you do this it will only make things worse.\n\nI say this as a recovering (and occasionally active) alcoholic - first of all your father will probably be crankier and more irritable without alcohol so think about that\n\nall alcoholics are pretty big dicks if you deny them alcohol they were looking forward to\n\nfor this reason I believe your plan will be a disaster\n\nalso it's a physical addiction\n\nNTA for WANTING them not to drink but they likely cannot control it to the point you're requesting and they spent all this money and have been looking forward to drinking. \n\nIt's totally not fair and I don't know what to say, I'm really sorry you're dealing w this.\n\nTheir behavior will not change on this trip.", "YTA - If you're not paying for anything then you'd be pretty damn entitled to try and control how the people who are paying for the vacation act.", "YTA\n\nYou do not get to tell others how to act.  You only get to decide if you want to be around them.", "ESH\nIt sounds like your parents have issues with drinking that really should have been addressed by now, so them wanting to take thier children on a drinking holiday just seems...bizarre? Given the past, I don't really understand why they think that's a remotely good idea. At the same time, you can't let them pay for the trip then dictate how they spend thier time on it. Do yourself a favor, save up and go yourself.", "I won't post a judgment, because you just don't realize that you are asking the impossible. \n\n>I have asked for over ten years for him to get help, and he has not. He has never once prioritized me over his drink. This includes my safety and my life.\n\n So what makes you think he will respond differently this time?\n\nYou cannot turn an alcoholic into an abstainer.  You do not have that power.  \n\nI recommend finding an Alateen meeting where you live.  If you won't or can't do that, you need to read up on alcoholism, and recognize that only the alcoholic can decide to stop drinking.  Nothing and no one else can make them do that.", "YTA, if you don\u2019t want to drink, it is absolutely your right not to. However, your family members have a right to decide for themselves to. It\u2019s never okay to force your will onto others. Although this is common, for children of alcoholics to have an issue with people drinking and with drinking in general. \n\n I once dated a guy who\u2019s Father was an alcoholic. We went on a trip to another State and stayed at a family member\u2019s house for the weekend. Because people were drinking, my ex stayed in the room. He only left to go to the bathroom. He wanted me to bring him food into the room, so he didn\u2019t have to be near people drinking\u2026 he even accused me of being an alcoholic, and that was the first time I drank while dating him, we were together for 6 months at that point. Luckily, before we broke up, I was able to convince him to go to therapy and work on his trauma. It actually really helped him and he\u2019s much better now. I believe he even drinks once in a while with his fianc\u00e9e, who is a lovely woman.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With her family or anyone else.\n\nThis isn't an actual, thoughtful, birthday gift.  They planned a drinking trip, and are using OP's birthday as an excuse to spend the money for themselves to take a fancy drinking trip.  They don't actually care if OP enjoys their birthday gift, or if it is to OP's tastes, or if OP has an enjoyable time on their birthday.\n\nMaking  this a birthday gift to OP changes the standards for judging their behavior.  They aren't planning a family trip and inviting OP along.  They are pretending to give OP something thoughtful for their birthday, but hijacking it so they have fun an OP doesn't.  The rules for \"is this a good birthday gift for this particular recipient\" apply, not \"we're paying for you to join us on a family vacation.\"\n\nIn either case, OP would not be AH to say \"if you're going to spend the whole time drunk, I decline to attend.\"  But they would only be mildly AH to plan a \"family trip\" that completely ignores the interests of one family member.

Wanting them to change doesn't make you an asshole, at all. However, thinking that they will change is denial on your part. Also, they're talking about going drinking on your 21st birthday. If you think this entire trip isn't going to be an attempt to guilt trip you into drinking by saying stuff like \"But we paid for this vacation, don't be a party pooper\", it's gonna be rough.\n\nI definitely think the right move is not to go on this vacation.
