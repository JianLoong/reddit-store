My girlfriend (F21) and I (F24) have been together for over a year. We met in an athletic setting and obviously we both were wearing athletic clothes. \n\nSince we have started dating, I\u2019ve found she pretty much only wear baggy athletic clothing ever (baggy sweatpants, baggy sweatshirts, baggy T-shirts etc.) She says it\u2019s because she likes these clothes because they\u2019re comfortable and stretchy. I don\u2019t usually mind because I\u2019m very active as well and am in athletic outfits a lot, but usually just to work out. \n\nI like putting a bit more effort into my appearance to go out in public if I\u2019m not working out though. This isn\u2019t going all out or spending 30 minutes getting ready or anything, but literally just wearing well-fitting jeans and T-shirt, maybe a nicer sweater. \n\nIt\u2019s become a bit of a contentious point for us though when we are going to a public event, dinner, group hangout etc. and I would really like her to wear something that\u2019s not ill-fitting and looks sloppy like she just got out of bed. I feel that how you dress and how you appear unfortunately play a big part in how people see you. People take you less seriously when you\u2019re dressed sloppily. \n\n I\u2019m not trying to get her to dress to the nines or anything, just some jeans or pants and a shirt that fits.

There is super casual, but then there is nice pants and a top casual, I completely get what you are saying.\n\nIt's funny, because when a woman complains about a man not dressing appropriately for a family dinner, holes in jeans, sloppy oversized top? We would all be ohh you can't be dating him blah blah.\n\nI'm actually genuinely surprised at all the YTA's here. I reckon a few of you are a little too up on your high horse and wouldn't be too happy if your parter dressed like they just got out of bed to an event with you! There are standards that I think we should meet for certain occasions.", "This isn\u2019t an asshole question.\n\nShe has no sense of occasion. Her lack of pride in her appearance turns you off. The way she dresses in public embarrasses you.\n\nThose are completely valid feelings, but if she doesn\u2019t want to accommodate your feelings, there\u2019s nothing you can do. \n\nYou can\u2019t force her, *that* would be an asshole move. You have to decide what\u2019s more important, her specifically as a person, or not drawing negative attention in public.\n\nThis is your insecurity but that\u2019s fine. She\u2019s free to accommodate it or not. Dudes that live with their mom and cat will be enjoying saying you\u2019re \u2018policing\u2019 her out of \u2018misogyny\u2019. You literally just expressed your feelings and asked. Sweatpants and a hoodie at a dinner in a restaurant where everyone\u2019s dressed nicely, just isn\u2019t appropriate. It\u2019s so childish and self-absorbed of her that I have to wonder if she has some body issues.\n\nYou are someone who likes to take pride in your appearance and she isn\u2019t. People *will* probably think badly of her at times, you\u2019re bothered by this, she isn\u2019t. You think of it as self-respect, and she doesn\u2019t have it and it turns you off. You\u2019re incompatible on this point. You just have to decide how important this is to you in a partner, whether it\u2019s a dealbreaker. NAH.", "NTA not every day is a sweat clothes day. There\u2019s nothing wrong with baggy comfortable clothes but there\u2019s a time and place for everything. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re request is unreasonable and if the roles were reversed you better believe most would be on her side", "NAH. I'm surprised at the amount of YTA - I don't think it's outrageous for the poster to expect someone to wear a simple jeans and t-shirt to an event or nice restaurant, instead of bloody gym gear. I don't think that's them being particularly shallow, it's standard practice. \n\nINFO - In saying that though, does your partner have body insecurity? You note that they wear baggy clothing, so there may be issues here that you have to be sensitive around. \n\nIf this is just how your partner is, and they refuse to compromise for whatever reason, you will just have to accept it or move on - depends how much of an issue it is for you.", "NTA\nDepending on approach and further context. If it\u2019s fully inappropriate clothing for the setting, like a nice food place, that makes sense. If it\u2019s genuinely just casual hang outs though, what\u2019s the harm? Have you already received any judgement about it?", "NTA. It is good manners to dress to the occasion. It is fine to wear the tatty but comfy tracksuit to the McDonalds drive through but not appropriate to wear it to a nice restaurant. The trackies might be okay to spend the day on your bestie's couch eating snacks and watching movies but not to go to a dinner party \"hang out\". OP's expectations don't seem unreasonable. She is not demanding full make up, high heels and a dress. She simply says jeans and a nice shirt.  It is normal to feel embarressed when your partner is dressed like a slob when a nicer look is required. I don't care what my kids where around the house but they know if they want to come out for dinner with us, they have to pick a nice shirt and pants that fit, and is not stained, faded or has holes in it. So ywnbta to have a talk with your partner about dressing a bit nicer when you go out. Offer to help her find some nice jeans and tops. If she refuses, you have your answer and will have to decide if this is a deal breaker. Personally, I would not judge you if it was.", "NAH for asking if she'll compromise for important occasions once in a while, but other than that, her opinion trumps your preference. It's her body and clothing to decide about.", "Might be controversial but NAH. You\u2019re on a thin line though. \n\nSo obviously she can choose how she dresses and shouldn\u2019t have to dress to impress 24/7. I often dress as she does because it\u2019s more comfortable for me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nHowever, I do see where you\u2019re coming from. If you\u2019re going out to a nice dinner or maybe for holidays, she should try to look more presentable. Like you said, a nice shirt and some jeans would be appropriate on some occasions. And if you\u2019re attending somewhere where you should dress nicely, I do think it\u2019s a bit rude not to. \n\nNonetheless, you can\u2019t really force her to dress a certain way. But I don\u2019t see the harm in asking her to dress casually nice for the events in question, as long as you don\u2019t push for it. If she refuses and it still bothers you that she never makes an effort to dress nice, then I would sum it up to incompatibility.", "INFO : Does your gf have sensory sensitivities, body dysmorphia, or an ED? Can she afford different clothes? These are all reasons a person might wear baggy gym clothes all the time that would make a request to dress up harsher than normal.", "NAH you have different standards then she does  for dressing in public (which is aloud not all two people are the same.) \n\nIt's OK to ask, and it's also OK for her to say no.", "NTA\n\nWhat is up with all these Y T A ? Everyone saying OP can dress like they want and let their girlfriend dress how she wants, that only works when they\u2019re not going out together. Can you imagine going out for dinner with your family or your friends or something and your partner is wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt ? People are saying to let her dress how she wants but they would be ashamed of being seen with her at social events too. \n\nAlso, asking her to dress at least a little bit nice (and jeans and a nice t-shirt is still casual) does not equal trying to force your girlfriend to change so she\u2019s more like you want, it\u2019s not that bad at all. \n\nSaying that, you obviously don\u2019t give the same attention to your appearance (since she doesn\u2019t appear to care how she presents herself to the world at all) and that might make you incompatible if she\u2019s not willing to make an effort. \n\nPeople are always changing and evolving, even (and especially) when they\u2019re in relationships, so saying you shouldn\u2019t try to change your girlfriend by making this very reasonable request is just ridiculous.", "NTA, I remember someone making a post about a bloke wearing basketball shorts to a (chain) restaurant and everyone lost their minds and told the dude to get some real trousers and stop being sloppy and embarassing.

We look incredibly mismatched when we go out. I am a barbie loving bisexual who dresses like a bratz doll. I actually love how we look together when we go out casually. We recently spent a night in town at a hotel and I wanted to wear my favourite dress to the hotel bar since it was a special occasion for us. My boyfriend was reluctant at first; he dresses this way for comfort, and I didn\u2019t press the issue, but he agreed to bring a shirt and if he didn\u2019t like it I wouldn\u2019t make him wear it. Not my place. I\u2019d seen him dressed up before (been together 6 months, we had attended a wedding and I spent the whole day complimenting how handsome he looked in his suit and now it\u2019s hanging with pride. He looked so so handsome.) but not in like a smart casual way? Like, now he knows he\u2019s handsome in the suit but still nervous to not wear his \u201cuniform\u201d. When he put on his little button up to go to the hotel bar I turned into the heart eyes emoji. He looked so good and I showered him with compliments and affection. I thanked him for putting the effort in, and made him stand in front of the mirror while I gushed about how good he looked in all his clothes; but the outfit he was in right then made him look especially handsome. I was happy our vibe matched to go for drinks. I could tell he felt so confident after that (I meant every word!) and is now happy to dress up a lil if we go somewhere fancy. It was purely a confidence thing with him, he\u2019d found his comfort zone and set up camp. tho in my case, the dress I wanted to wear is pretty hot - nothing too fancy, it\u2019s from asos lmao - and I\u2019d have dressed down a little if he wanted to as well. Think he just wanted to compromise to see me in the dress, but it got us there. \n\nNAH", "LOL.

If a situation arises where it does, that's what dress coded events are for.\n\nOP, if you're embarrassed to be around her, break it off. You deserve someone with the same outlook on presentability and she deserves not to be judged for a harmless life choice.", "NTA.\n\nI'm all for being comfortable. But sometimes context and situations matter. There's a way to find a balance. \n\nI'm going through this right now. Bf only wears graphic and band t-shirts. For everything (and some are starting to have holes in the seams). Even a plain solid color tee would be better sometimes. \n\n The most dressed up he'll get is black jeans and a polo shirt. I did convince him to wear a dress shirt without a tie to a formal wedding one time, but that shirt mysteriously disappeared later.", "The thing I would ask is \u2018Does she know how to?\u2019 and. \u2018Can she afford it?\u2019  We all have comfort zones that shrink easily, some people are far quicker to feel it, and leaving our comfort  zones creates anxiety. I used to feel weird wearing jeans when I wore suits and heels all the time. Years later I felt weird wearing heels when I had been wearing jeans and flats all the time. That creates a level of anxiety on it\u2019s own, and that came with me already having nice clothes, accessories, being more than proficient at doing my hair and make up. Feeling glamorous doesn\u2019t just happen, it\u2019s a carefully crafted result that requires continual effort. The first thing that will make her feel better about herself is a good haircut and colour. It has a knock on effect and just makes you feel so much better about yourself. You want to be helping her gradually expand her comfort zone to include a more glamorous look, we\u2019ll be aware that it costs money and requires knowledge and practice. If I were you I would pay for a haircut and colour and a facial/massage whatever as a treat and buy her some new sports clothes, some hair accessories, a bottle of perfume. Does she have make up? Know how to apply it? Know how to dress for her shape? What colours suit her? Where to buy the clothes she wants within her budget?", " NTA. If she likes comfy athletic wear that much, they actually make flared yoga pants. When paired with a regular shirt they look like black pants. Or even some leggings and an oversized soft sweater. Comfy and nice looking can still work with athletic wear. I would suggest starting small though. Don\u2019t ask her to change everything all at once. Maybe start with pants as those will still look ok with a sweatshirt. Once that is comfortable to her, add in an oversized shirt, sweater, even graphic tee. Just make them all oversized so it more comfy at first. Small is the key", "who cares", "Mild ESH. You suck b/c this is how she has always presented herself, and now you\u2019re being judgey. Her SUPER MILDLY only in the case that there are some situations that baggy sweats aren\u2019t appropriate. She doesn\u2019t need to \u201cdress up\u201d for hanging out, but if it\u2019s like a work event, a bit of fitting your clothes to the occasion is warranted.", "YTA. Want her to dress nicer?

Ultimately what she wears is her choice but you have every right to feel as you do and to ask.

And I think it also has to do with respect for the people around you. \n\nNo matter how warm or how much of a surfer person you might be, you e.g. won't go in a bikini to your office or a restaurant. You wouldn't wear your dress robe when you have an appointment at the bank. I personally won't wear my leather boots, spikey belt, leather mini skirt or band shirt with a rotting goat on it to work or a restaurant. Instead I dress in simple plain black clothes that are good fitting and clean. I do so not because I feel forced or pressured by society and suffer from it or any bullshit but because I understand social code and want to respect people around me and show some common sense and sense for occasion. \n\nPeople will indeed view you as stubborn, childish and won't take your serious if you refuse to do so and in my personal opinion they are right. \n\nSo NTA but I am afraid you are probably not compatible here because if she sees no problem it's unlikely she'll feel anything but oppressed if you ask her to change her clothing style in public.", ">It\u2019s become a bit of a contentious point for us though when we are going to a public event, dinner, group hangout etc.\n\nIt is embarrassing when you go out for dinner or go to a public event and people don't dress for it. \n\nPeople can wear what they want, but making a bit of an effort when going out for dinner with your partner is just about the minimum effort you can put into a relationship. It's not hard.\n\nNTA.", "Given the context, NTA, it is not unreasonable to ask/expect her to make an effort if your going out somewhere a little nicer or above casual.\nMy wife has taught me much about this stuff, to all the people saying she should dress how she feels comfortable,  tell me this again when she turns up as a guest in sweats to a formal dinner....", "NTA", "Why do people have to dress up? I feel more comfortable in these kinds of clothes. I\u2019m also not going to police what my partner wears? I love her no matter what, no matter what she wears. If she wears baggy clothes to a restaurant, I\u2019ll do the same with her :)\n\nWe fought long and hard for rights to wear what we want as women around the world, why are we getting all up in arms here?

Did I understand right?", "YTA REGARDLESS\n\nNobody has any business telling anyone else what to put on their body.\n\nIf the way they dress bothers you so much it's worth bringing up to your partner and ruining their self-esteem or trying to alter their personal style/identity so you can feel better about how others see you as a couple - then you need to consider what you are prioritizing in a relationship.\n\nIt's not even like when this person met the gf the gf dressed in a more \"pleasing to OP\" fashion and then one day decided to change how she dressed. OP knew  how the gf dressed when entering the relationship.\n\nYTA", "I mean, I don't think that asking her to dress one step above 'slob' when they go out together for date night or something is trying to change her.

She is not making her partner put a gown dress to go get coffee, she is giving her pov, and fashion advice. In fact, it may even help her so to build or elevate her self esteem, that is if the gf decides to try a different clothing style..\n\nBesides, if someone puts little to no effort into their appearance, that might be a sign of something more serious, like depression. Or maybe some kind of body complex, which may also be linked to some eating disorder. Or maybe she has low self esteem and that's why she refuses to dress outside of confort clothing. But hey, no one has the right to share an opinion on what someone else puts on their body, that's rude.", "She uses the word baggy four times, then ill-fitting.

Like we don't hear it enough from men. \n\nDon't wear stuff that looks baggy or scruffy your not being feminine enough. \n\nDon't wear stuff that's too tight or reveals some skin it makes you look slutty. \n\nWear makeup so your feminine enough\n\nDon't wear makeup it makes you a target for men. \n\nLike just let people be", "You'd be *insulted* someone is in sweats? Honestly it wouldn't even cross my mind.", "No effort, no pride?! Wtf \n\nIt's not always about you. \n\n\nA vast array of people have sensory issues or perhaps disabilities that mean wearing \"jeans and nice sweater\" is literally a torturous experience.\n\nFor some people they literally can not deal with buttons/zips because they don't have the sequencing or dexterity. \n\nThere's so many reason people may choose to dress in what is comfortable to them and literally none of that impacts you. \n\nI'd far rather a friend felt at ease and relaxed in my company than self conscious about their attire.", "Ya I agree with this. It\u2019s nice to see effort from a partner in ANY arena - education, style, hobbies, whatever. To be always in sweats and sweatshirts is easily perceived as a lack of caring in how you look. I don\u2019t get why the gf doesn\u2019t just buy 2 pairs of jeans and 2 tshirts, it isn\u2019t like jeans are damn corsets.", "Who are you yo set the standard of what is presentable for someone else? Seems quite judgemental.", "Yeah, if she has her answer, and it's tied to some kind of insecurity, hopefully they have the level of communication that lets them find a solution.   \n\n\nThis is not always the case, even with very well meaning partners. IME", "If you have brought it up and partner says they are not changing how they dress, that's that. \n\nThe fact that it has gotten to be a contentious point, means this person is placing way to much value on what their gf is wearing. If it's that big of an issue then break up - no relationship should have contention becuase one parnter keeps trying to get you to change the way you dress. That's not hurting anyone. \n\nOP is placing so much value on appearance and being worried about how others percieve her with her gf to the point that they are having arguments. Not healthy.\n\nAccept your gf for the way she is (her behavior is harming neither OP or herself) or find someone else who agrees with your clothing opinions.", "Exactly. OP clearly thinks she\u2019s above her gf, you can see it in the way she describes how she dresses and then compares that with the way her gf dresses as if she\u2019s shaming her. She either needs to change her whole mindset so she can truly love her gf because this isn\u2019t it, or she can set her free and find someone to reach her incredibly high and unhealthy standards. Either way, her current mindset isn\u2019t healthy for her gf and I hope she realizes how much it hurts", "Yeah, being insulted by a friend\u2019s outfit is such an outsized response. Pardon me, your majesty, let me get my court clothes on to appear in your presence.", "Insulted is a strong word, disgrunteled maybe, put off. You know how what you wear says a lot about your attitude, your personality- its very similar to body language.\n\nMy main thing is you can have incredibly comfy clothes that are at least cute or something. Just seems like the most minimal effort you can put into yourself is dressing decently and be comfy.", "Oh 100%, if theres a sensory issues, what ever they need, would never ask that of someone, same with dexterity issues (hell ive adjusted clothing for those with dexterity issues)\n\nBut aside from basically medical issues, i just dont see how someone can only be comfy in sweatpants- espcially since there are so many other options.\n\nAlso lets not deny that at least in the uk those who wear joggers, tracksuits and loungewear out tend to be stereotyped (theres a reason that stereotype exsists)- theres massive social stimgas at play here."]}
