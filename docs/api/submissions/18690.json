Buy some nice scented hand soap and some really good hand lotion for all of the sinks.  Then instead of talking to your wife, just go right to MIL and thank her profusely for being sooo willing to go the extra mile and wash her hands so often around your new baby.  Present her with the products as a thanks for the extra effort incentive. Also put good quality tissues in every room....just in case.", "Nta, your kid can get sick or even die from the germs and diseases carried on your hands.

She absolutely demanded that people wash their hands, or at least put on hand sanitizer before touching him.  Nowadays, you seriously can\u2019t be too careful when it comes to the health of an infant especially since they don\u2019t have an immune system until they turn around six months to a year old, so anytime before then any type of illness, can literally be a death sentence for them if your mother-in-law doesn\u2019t want to wash her hands before holding your child then let her know that she\u2019s not allowed to hold him/her it\u2019s not that hard just to take some hand sanitizer heck even some antibacterial/baby wipes, and give her hands a good wipe down before holding a literal, immune-compromised infant!!", "NTA, you are papa bear and you are there to protect your cub. Tell her directly next time, no need for your wife to do it. It is your home and she should respect the house rules. Try going out of your way to get some very nice moisturizing hand soaps so there can be no more excuses.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She absolutely should be washing her hands and using sanitizer. RSV can kill your baby! Covid can kill your baby. She's a newborn. Is her help really worth your child's life? My son got RSV from his father going to the gym and ended up on a ventilator where we had to tell him goodbye. This is a major thing. No hand washing no baby, period full stop no, if's, ands or buts. Get lotion. I'm constantly washing my hands and my sons almost 2. I keep lotion everywhere around the house. It helps. I really have an issue with dry hands like they drive me crazy and I can't handle the feeling. So I use lotion (was unscented when he was a baby baby) all the time.", "Gross. NTA. She needs to go.", "NTA. Gross. That's not \"old school\" that's just dirty. My great grandparents washed their hands every time they went to the restroom and they were born in 1900. \n\nThat being said, the odds of y'all dying from her unhygienic habits are low. You have to decide if it's something to continue to fight over. In a germaphobe, so it would be a huge deal for me.", "NTA - you can get hand wash that doesn\u2019t dry out your hands.         \nShe\u2019s just filthy", "NTA. But get some moisturizing soap...this seems pretty obvious to me. I get mine in bulk from Target. My boyfriend is a smoker and the constant handwashing is rough on his hands and this is an easy solution.", "I currently live as an expat in a country where they don't believe in washing their hands, at all. Believe me, you're never ever going to get her to change her ways. Try to find some other help with the baby, and in the meantime remind MIL how much she must have missed her home and friends.", "I see lots of people recommending options such as wipes and sanitizer, but forget that. Those just dry the skin and are not effective. It\u2019s not even necessarily the soap, it\u2019s the friction. You can get moisturizing soap. That\u2019s the best options to beat dry hands and you don\u2019t have to worry about lotion incubating germs.\n\nThe number one training all caregivers, medical practitioners, etc get in every job, every position, and reiterated every year is about proper hand washing. It\u2019s the absolute number one way to prevent illness. Seriously. We have to do trainings on it constantly, even though it\u2019s the most basic skill-it\u2019s the most important. There are some good YouTube videos that show how many germs remain after washing versus other options that may help her. But I would stop worrying about hurt feelings and start worrying about badgering her every day with different information resources on the topic. She\u2019ll either learn, give in, or leave.\n\nGood luck. NTA", "We already have lotion everywhere. There's no shortage. It's just that she doesn't think it's worth washing hands. She's not anti vaxxer but she thinks it's ok not to wash as she has been the same her entire life.", "I did bring up this idea to my wife and she got all emotional on me. She knows her mom is wrong and stubborn and she rather make me suffer than say anything more to her.", "Need to check that out \ud83d\ude00", "We already have hand lotions In all washrooms and sinks. Even in her room. It's hard to convince her that hand washing actually matters.", "Thank u . Thats a great advice. To give her a wipe. I think it's her mindset that's the problem here - she doesn't think washing hands matters. She says she's been like this her whole life.", "I've done that- talk directly. She then whines about it with my wife that I keep torturing her. \n\nShe hardly even wears a mask whereas we have never stopped wearing it.", "That is so sad and I'm sorry to hear that. I feel the same paranoia with my daughter. I was Ok before covid but after covid, I wash my hands every now and then and we still wear a mask. My MIL acts as a child and doesn't do any of that. \n\nThat's what we do. We rarely ask her to hold the baby , but at this point, it just feels that she's on a holiday here as we don't ask her to do most of the stuff.", " I've become a germaphobe after covid and it makes me go crazy eating food cooked by her. That's why I started making my own food and making it awkward for her", "You are absolutely right. There is no way I can make her change her habits. I'm a fool for thinking we can change her", "You addressed the main issue here. It's not really about dry hands. It's her mindset that makes her believe that it's all Ok. No amount of easy options like wipes will work for her.", "Can you ask her to leave, then? You can\u2019t force her to change, gross as it is. You\u2019re not an AH at all, either. But her leaving seems like the easiest and most efficient solution.", "FWIW, antivaxxers and non-hand washers are not necessarily the same crowd. I know many anti-vaxxers. They all wash their hands. :)", "I have a spray called Microban 24. It kills germs on surfaces for 24 hours. I have workers in my house right now and I can't trust their hand washing habits. So every morning I spray every surface with the Microban. You could try this. \n\nAlso, suggest wipes for MIL? Or start spraying her with Lysol when she leaves the bathroom? \n\nI'm not so worried about gardening. But fecal matter, yes. Gross.", "At the very least got lots of bottles of hand sanitizer and leave them around the house\u2026", "Check out the Drunk History video of it, it's delightful and horrifying.", "Please don\u2019t I\u2019ll give you the short version woman with a biological diarrhea disease cooks for people all the time without washing her hands her food literally poisons them to the point that they die after three days of eating her food she was put on death row after being confirmed to have killed over 20 to 30 different families and forced to cook her own meals so she would die the same way her victims died. Keep in mind she never knew she was the reason they were dying.", "Sorry...she's just gross.  I probably wash my hands at least 5 times while I'm cooking.  I watched a demonstration once where they dipped a chicken breast in something that glowed under black light.  After the person was done cooking, they went about their business.  Then they shined the black light around to see what got past the hand washing to get \"bacteria\" all over.  The stuff was everywhere, including the kids.  I have been conscious of my hand washing since then.", "Something to be aware of with lotions is that they can actually pass germs around. They occasionally cause outbreaks in nursing homes. Just FYI.", "If you can live without her support I would ask her to leave. Maybe passive aggressively tell her a new season of I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE just came out", "Sorry I should have clarified my son did live it made it sound like he passed. But RSV did permanent damage to his lungs and they had to give him hospital fentanyl my baby already had hard narcotics before he was even 2 months old. Please take this seriously. Their is no worse sound then your baby crying on a ventilator. It's silent but the tears are real and I still see it in my nightmares. I hear the doctor telling me to be prepared to say goodbye after a traumatic birth where I almost died. She's probably old school and thinks baby's need exposed to germs but this strongly is not true for newborns. I wouldn't wish seeing your baby on a ventilator with RSV for my worst enemy in the world. It truly was the most awful time of my life. Get her some soap and lotions. And seriously no hand washing no baby or even cooking food.", "My wife thinks I'm an AH as I'm asking her to leave. She's come from our home country via a 14 hr flight", "If she thinks soap dries her hands, she won\u2019t be using sanitiser", "Will try that as well.", "I love drunk history videos", "She was asymptomatic and immune to typhoid, but contagious.  There are bunches of people like that, but they can manage it if they are careful.  She refused to be careful.", "She was not put on death row \ud83e\udd23\n\nShe was quarantined multiple times. \n\nShe did know that she was making people sick. So she would change her name to get jobs until they finally imprisoned her for good.", "Oh damn! I know that's another extreme but I get your point. I just feel so helpess and frustrated", "Haha, the thing is , she has come a long way via 14.hoir flight and my wife would never let me say that to her.", "Wow. Thanks for sharing this.", "Then your wife needs to deal with the shocking hygiene issue. It\u2019s disgusting and unsafe. NTA", "Yeah was thinking it might be a compromise\u2026 but OP could then also say wash your hands, use the sanitizer or go home\u2026", "She knows it well but there's a boundary that she won't cross. Basically after that point,  her moms emotions > hygiene", "Are her mum\u2019s emotions of greater importance than the literal health of your baby?", "How about a doctors appointment where you either have the Dr raise the importance of this to your wife, or even having MIL join you so doctor can really scare her w horror stories? Could backfire but still\u2026 they\u2019re not taking you seriously even though you are totally right.", "No they're not.  Hence this rant:(", "That's a good plan.  I will have to brief the doctor before hand.   Hehe.. \n\nI wish my wife would not succumb to all the emotional drama of my Mil. She's asked me not to say anything directly to her as my mil gets offended easily and then plays the emotional card.", "I mean to your wife? Because if she thinks about it that way, then the answer is clear. She needs to step up.", "I know. Looks like I need to poke more irrespective if what my wife thinks. It's time for a war !!"]}
