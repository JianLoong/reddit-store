There is a huge difference between 21 year old and 16 yo.", "So what part of your judgement makes OP an AH?", "In the US driving schools I've been to, those cars are not the norm.  Teenagers are also expected to practice with family outside of the school in the family cars before being fully licensed.  Where I live it's 30 hours in a classroom but you still need another 40 of practice usually under the supervision of a parent but any adult license holder will do before you can take the actual driving test.", "So to a 5yo and a new born are the same age?", "I don't remember what exactly the rules were where I am, but I know with a learner's permit the rules were structured to disallow this exact situation. You couldn't have minors for passengers at all and some other stuff. They say it's to keep from distracting new drivers, but I think it's also to prevent a bunch of teenagers from getting in a car and being a menace on wheels. Both are good enough reasons in my book.", "That's extremely true, didn't thought about it for one minute but it would be a fantastic opportunity to teach his sister how to parallel park AND how to stick to your No. Both extremely useful.", "Thanks for the heads up ill be sure to do this in the future!", "At the point where he's arguing with her, the owner of the car, over her decision, yeah, he IS being annoying.  It's not rude to tell someone they are being rude.  And him being annoying factored into OP's decision -- if he's acting up that much before he even gets into the car, then yes, she's wise not to trust him not to be distracting during the lesson.", "*croaky old man voice* \u0262\u1d07\u1d1b \u1d0f\u0493\u0493 \u1d0d\u028f \u029f\u1d00\u1d21\u0274!!", "absolutely!!!", "You'll see the same difference yet again in 4 years, good luck.", "Wrong.  I know 16 yo men.  Those two are screwing.", "yes but not because she choose to not taking the firen in her car but to give us and them a false excuse.\n\nshe state it herself \"I don't like her friends\"", "My state you have to be 25 to be teaching others to drive so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "when it comes to driving, in many cases age is experience. someone who's 21 with a license has far less experience than someone aged 41 whose been driving for 20 years. OP hasn't been driving for very long and thus is inexperienced compared to actual, proper driving instructors.", "Right? They're so easily distracted! With all 3 kids we started out on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere just so i could break them of the habit of fiddling with the stereo or glancing down at their phone if it went off. That alone took a solid month. I couldn't imagine if they'd had a friend along. (They are all good drivers now, but holy hell)", "Who the fuck cares what he knew or was expecting?  Her car, her rules.  And extra passengers during a driving lesson? No way.", "That doesn't mean anything with discussion about OPs problem. Her sister's friend was pushy and couldn't understand single explanation. He is still 16 yo and his parents are fully responsible for him.", "When I was 16 I had multiple female friends I didn\u2019t fuck. You do know that\u2019s possible, right?", "Probably because it would be an easier conversation to have, saying \"you're not legally allowed to get in\" rather than \"you cant get in because I dont like you\" to a teenager", "And I totally get OP helping her sister but allowing another child in the car would have been waaay irresponsible. I\u2019m very glad she didn\u2019t.", "~~This commentary~~ (edit: my reply) was only pertaining to the specific detail of him showing up early.\n\n(Edit) As the other person (bowy...24)  mentioned, we all have those friends who can sort of just show up whenever. But what I wonder is if he knew about his friends plans with her older sister and if he meant to barge in on them or not. Chances are the girl told him but we arent given that context. Of course this doesn't excuse his behavior either way but it does give us more perspective on the situation.", "Don't abuse reports. Nothing about the comment you replied to is a personal attack.", "[removed]", "Sure.  But...from OPs description...those two are involved.", "you're  right it's easier", "Oh absolutely. I wouldn't want my kids in the car while an inexperienced driver was learning.", "Where OP behave like \"bratty teen\"?

And the tween immaturity signs were:\n\n1) thinking teen boys are dumb for being teens, as though tweens aren't also annoying to adults.\n\n2) being snappy with her sister's friends as though they're just nuissances.\n\n3) the age comment itself.\n\nBut most importantly, teens telling tweens they're embarrassing usually get it right. 16 year olds look up to their 21 year old siblings unless they actually fuck up. They only rebel against actual adults, not tweens.", "Not a normal reaction for a friend, but a boyfriend.  Yes.", "1. Because most teens are immature. They are kids.\n\n2. Because he was pushy and couldn't understand or accept OPs boundaries. It's her car and she is able to decide who is in it.\n\n3. That doesn't make her an asshole. It's truth. He is not mature like OP and there is a big difference between them. \n\nOP had every right to refuse him entering her car as if something happened she would be responsible for him.", "A sibling insulted their friend seems like as good a time as any to tell her sister to fuck off and leave.\n\nI\u2019ve fought with my siblings over less.", "There wasn't an insult.  In OPs post.", "She called him an annoying kid that could easily be perceived as an insult intentional or not.", "Also, in some places it's illegal to have a non-related teenager in the car while someone is driving with a permit while a non-parent/guardian is the chaperone.  \n\nIt may not be a law by OP, but those laws exist for a reason, teenagers are known to distract learning drivers and having a person in the car who was arguing with and not respecting the person giving the lesson is a recipe for disaster.\n\nNTA for being a responsible adult.  Don't worry too much about your sister's embarrassment, at that age teens place way too much stock on other teens' opinions of them."]}
