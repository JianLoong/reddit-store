Neither of us are in a financial situation where we can go out to eat very often. Recently we were invited to dinner with his dad, stepmom and sister. They said it was a family dinner and they were treating us.\n\nHis dad ordered appetizers for the table and got a cocktail, as did his wife. I ordered a glass of a type of wine I've never had before. I figured this was a good time to try it, as ordering wine with dinner is a normal thing to do. The glass was $9. Both cocktails were $13. My boyfriend's sister got a smoothie that was $7. He drank water.\n\nThe dinner was nice, but my boyfriend acted a little weird during it. After dinner he said it was really rude and tacky that I ordered alcohol on his \"dad's dime.\" I was really embarrassed by this accusation. I said he offered to treat us and it was only one glass of reasonably priced wine. I didn't order champagne or anything crazy. I also didn't get a dessert, which his dad and sister did. I don't feel like I \"spent\" more than anyone else did. I feel like my order was very normal for the situation.\n\nHe insists that it wasn't and I was greedy. My feelings were hurt and I accused him of being embarrassed he isn't old enough to drink and I am. He said I was deflecting. I offered him $10, but he wouldn't take it.

It can be a weird posturing thing, and he might be inventing something to cover that. Alternately, it could just be untrodden ground for him, as he probably hasn\u2019t dated someone who can order alcohol at restaurants before, and he may feel strange about it.\n\nThat said, some people do have different ideas about how you should order as a matter of etiquette when being treated by someone. Most of those times, those values are passed through families to children\u2014if he wasn\u2019t set off by one of the above reasons, it could be that he thought his parents would dislike your ordering that, and was made uncomfortable.

I would only call you TA if you had ordered multiple beverages.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm guessing that he was embarrassed that you are old enough to be drinking alcohol and he isn't.  My guess is that, at some point, the age difference between the two of you was mentioned by his parents, and not likely in a favorable way. I could be wrong.", "NTA.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You're of drinking age, and your boyfriends parents both ordered cocktails.  Also, they said it was a family dinner, and it sounds like they consider you family.  It would be a little different if neither of them had.  In that situation it would have been appropriate to ask if it was okay to order one.\n\nI remember being19/21 and on a tight budget.  Back then financial things seemed like a much bigger deal than they were.  Nine dollars for a glass of wine while eating out isn't a big thing.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend seems a bit bizarre.  The wine cost less than the cocktails.  Hell, these days a bleedin' Coke is $3.50 at a restaurant.  I personally try to never try to out-spend the person paying for a meal.  So I'll only get a cocktail if I happen to be the one paying.  I think you were fine, and didn't deserve to be verbally abused by your boyfriend.", "NTA, and your intuition is right. This isn't at all about money. Your choice to join the \"adults\" in imbibing drew a line between you three and the kids. He was on the wrong side of that line. He's insecure, but I don't know anyone who wouldn't be in his circumstances.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, wine with dinner is perfectly acceptable. Your bf\u2019s just pissed off that he\u2019s not old enough to drink.", "NTA", "When I take adults out to dinner I expect that they will likely order a glass of wine. If we all like the same kind, sometimes we get a bottle for the table. You behaved in a socially appropriate way, but it did highlight that your boyfriend isn't of age.

If you'd ordered a bottle of Dom, big problem. A single glass of wine? You're boyfriend is being silly.", "NTA. It was not rude and tacky to order a glass of wine with dinner, especially since it was comparable in price to what other people ordered, and other people were drinking alcohol, too- including the people paying for the meal. Your boyfriend sounds immature and he\u2019s T A here.", "Nta", "NTA. You generally don't get something more expensive than what the host is having when they offer to buy you a dinner. If they're having a drink, you can, too. Same for dessert. You just generally shouldn't order something more expensive than what they're getting for themselves.\n\nYour boyfriend's reaction is odd. Was he raised to be frugal? If he was often told \"no\" growing up when he asked for something to drink other than water, he might have some emotional baggage about it. You should ask him why he thinks ordering drinks is a bad idea when someone else has offered to pay for dinner.\n\nWhen I'm buying dinner for someone, I want them to enjoy themselves. I don't want them to save me a few dollars by drinking water if they would really prefer something else.", "Nope, you\u2019re fine. Boyfriend is a bit strange though.", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely fine to order a single drink when someone offers to pay for dinner.", "NTA, when they treated you out they knew what it entailed, it's not disrespectful to order a reasonably priced drink, if anything they'd be TA if they offered to treat you, but got upset at you ordering anything other than the cheapest main course. Your boyfriend needs to get the stick out of his ass, he's not the one paying.", "NTA. I do think you should have asked permission to make it clear your intentions and find out if it was something they were okay with, but if they didn't say anything to you, then I think it must have been okay with them. I also think it's a little unfair of you to accuse your boyfriend of simply being embarrassed he's not old enough to drink. But overall, these things do not make you an asshole. If I were paying for relatives or friends by saying \"it's my treat\", I would probably personally lay out expectations like \"It's my treat, but I don't have a budget for alcohol.\" or \"It's my treat, but I only have the budget for us all to share a dessert\" or \"It's my treat, please get anything you'd like, regardless of price.\" Communication is a two-way street. If they didn't give you stipulations or complain themselves, then your boyfriend is offended on their behalf with no basis for that offense.", "What is rude and tacky is your boyfriend trying to embarrass you for ordering a drink at dinner.  My guess is he is projecting some issue here about not being able to legally drink or order alcohol when you can. His parents offered to treat you, if it bother him that much maybe he should have asked for a separate bill.", "NTA. In terms of money, you were clearly fine because your drink didn't cost much more than a non-alcoholic one would and you didn't order dessert. But sometimes alcoholic drinks are seen as \"extra\" in a way that other menu items aren't. You don't know where the parents stood on this. Bf might well be overreacting\n\nBest would have been I guess asking the parents if they minded you ordering a glass of wine, and going by their reaction (if they seemed awkward or hesitant, don't do it even if they said it would be okay).", "> The glass was $9.

I can\u2019t really articulate it very well; but I think if your boyfriend is not drinking, then you shouldn\u2019t be drinking.

My guess is his family had a similar dynamic and ordering something that objectively isn\u2019t a big probably made him nervous or insecure.

You could in future say \"this wine looks lovely, would you mind if I order a glass?\" But honestly if the parents had an issue they should say so before dining...like \"we are able to cover everyone's entree.\" I don't think there is anything wrong with having these types of conversations.

Generally the host or hostess will make a suggestion (indicating an okay price range) or will place their own order. At that point you have to move fast; you might have two different orders in mind, so then you can respond with whichever seems appropriate.\n\nDrinks orders are another tipoff. There are people who do not drink. They will place no drinks order and say nothing at all about drinking, or they may say that they're not drinking tonight but, please have a glass of wine/mixed drink if you like. If they don't mention drinking at all, you would be safest to not order alcohol at all.\n\nBut let's say you're in a party of eight or ten. The host/hostess may say nothing about drinking at all, but then some of the guests will go ahead and order alcohol. You can that as an indication that drinking is okay at the table even if the host abstains (but of course don't order a wildly expensive drink).\n\nIf the host/hostess decides to order wine, they may ask if you have a preference. It's perfectly okay for you to say you're just learning---what would they recommend?  Especially at your age, you don't need to pretend to an expertise you don't have. They are likely to be flattered if you tell them you'd appreciate their explaining to you why they are choosing the wine they choose.\n\nHere's a tip I wish someone had shared with me at your age. There will be bullies at the table who push you to drink when you don't want to. \"Oh, look, there's Barbara with her Coke again tonight.\" Do not be intimidated by these shit-for-brains people!  Do not let yourself be bullied, and do not feel that you have to respond to their goading. A simple \"Thanks, I'm okay with this\" never hurt a guest in their host's estimation.", "Agreeing with 215. My boyfriend was 19 when we started dating and I was 22. He had no qualms about me ordering a glass of wine or cocktail with meals because he understood it was a normal thing. If you're insecure that you can't legally buy alcohol while your partner can probably means you should be dating people closer to your age.", "NTA", "You follow the host\u2019s example. That is exactly what you did.", "NTA\n\nIn our family if one person is paying the first drink is \u201cfree\u201d unless whatever we wanted was crazy expensive then we\u2019d check with who was paying. \n\nWhen I go out with people I don\u2019t know as well as my immediate family I\u2019ll always offer the person who paid cash and say it\u2019s for my drink. Usually they will refuse but it makes me feel better", "NTA  He definitely is though and may not be mature enough for you to be dating unfortunately.", "Yeah. On his 21st birthday.", "Well ain't you just the Emily Post of AITA. \u2665\ufe0f", "This is lovely advice.  I second all of it.", "The boyfriend will continue to shame you for drinking legally since he cannot. One of the big reasons my younger ex and I broke up at this same age. He was 19, I was 21. I wasn\u2019t gonna wait around and waste the greatest years of my life with his judgements and emotional abuse.", "NTA. If someone else is paying, yeah you don't order the most expensive thing on the menu but a glass of wine is completely normal. Looks like your boy's ego was hurt because he's too young for wine.....", "NTA\n\nLike everyone else has said, follow the lead of the hosts.\n\nOne thing I would do with my wife's aunt, cousin and grandmother when they would treat, was always pay for my beer (and any alcohol my wife ordered if she was in the mood) separately, since none of them drank.\n\nEdited for clarification.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, in a lot of places these days, a Coke or a lemonade can easily cost $5 a glass, never mind a few bucks more for an alcoholic beverage. And Sis' smoothie cost $7. Did your boyfriend say anything about it? I bet not.", "NTA. Someday you will look back and laugh at this. He was embarrassed that he couldn't legally drink, although in some states, mine actually, he could have with his parents there. It was not the price of the beverage, it was the content. Learn a few \"mocktails\" in the mean time to appease his fragile ego.", "NTA it sounds like you hit the nail on the head and HE is deflecting.", "He's being immature because he is immature. He'll grow out of it in a bit, but you shouldn't be surprised.", "It's also perfectly acceptable to ask the one who offered to treat. Just say \"Hey, do you mind if I order a drink?\" And go from there", "I personally do not order alcohol unless I'm invited to do so. My husband comes from a much more affluent family than me, and he approaches these situations the same way I do. I don't believe your actions make you TA, as it's a complicated dynamic to navigate. NAH", "No way, I\u2019ve taken my son and his girlfriend, as well as many of his friends to meals, not only do I expect them to drink what they want, but I encourage it.  If they didn\u2019t want you to drink a glass of wine they wouldn\u2019t have taken you out.  Boyfriend is being silly, but if I had to guess, there\u2019s something else going on there.  Maybe he feels weird you\u2019re old enough to drink in a restaurant and he can\u2019t? I\u2019d ask him if there is something else going on.", "Just out of curiosity where do you live?", "It's a tough job but *shrugs* somebody needs to do it!"]}
