Neither of us are in a financial situation where we can go out to eat very often. Recently we were invited to dinner with his dad, stepmom and sister. They said it was a family dinner and they were treating us.\n\nHis dad ordered appetizers for the table and got a cocktail, as did his wife. I ordered a glass of a type of wine I've never had before. I figured this was a good time to try it, as ordering wine with dinner is a normal thing to do. The glass was $9. Both cocktails were $13. My boyfriend's sister got a smoothie that was $7. He drank water.\n\nThe dinner was nice, but my boyfriend acted a little weird during it. After dinner he said it was really rude and tacky that I ordered alcohol on his \"dad's dime.\" I was really embarrassed by this accusation. I said he offered to treat us and it was only one glass of reasonably priced wine. I didn't order champagne or anything crazy. I also didn't get a dessert, which his dad and sister did. I don't feel like I \"spent\" more than anyone else did. I feel like my order was very normal for the situation.\n\nHe insists that it wasn't and I was greedy. My feelings were hurt and I accused him of being embarrassed he isn't old enough to drink and I am. He said I was deflecting. I offered him $10, but he wouldn't take it. Is it asshole behavior to order alcohol on someone else's dime?", "created_utc": 1677627050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11enlj8/aita_for_drinking_alcohol/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They ordered $13 cocktails, so you ordered a slightly cheaper glass of wine. Perfect. Not even remotely weird.\n\nIt's not like they were counting pennies or they wouldn't have ordered appetizers for the table or drinks for themselves. I think your under-21 boyfriend just doesn't have the experience to understand this social norm. He'll probably change his mind in 3-4 years.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t break any rules of etiquette, the person who paid doesn\u2019t seem unhappy with it, and no harm was done - i think you\u2019re spot on when you say your boyfriend feels inadequate or envious that he couldn\u2019t drink too.", "NTA, but proceed with caution.\n\nIf his parents said they were treating,  you didn\u2019t order anything outlandish, you weren\u2019t the only person ordering alcohol, and there\u2019s no norm in the family re: children not ordering something other than water, I don\u2019t think you were the asshole. Look to how his parents reacted\u2014they were your hosts. If they didn\u2019t blink, think nothing of it.\n\nTwo things come to mind with your bf: First, he may be resentful\u2014weird as it sounds\u2014of you being able to drink, and him not. It can be a weird posturing thing, and he might be inventing something to cover that. Alternately, it could just be untrodden ground for him, as he probably hasn\u2019t dated someone who can order alcohol at restaurants before, and he may feel strange about it.\n\nThat said, some people do have different ideas about how you should order as a matter of etiquette when being treated by someone. Most of those times, those values are passed through families to children\u2014if he wasn\u2019t set off by one of the above reasons, it could be that he thought his parents would dislike your ordering that, and was made uncomfortable. It might be worthwhile to check in with him to see if either of them said something after the fact.", "NTA. Totally normal, reasonable order. Even considering that you were being treated and don't want to take advantage.\n\nIf your feeling is that it's got more to do with him feeling weird or excluded for being underage, that sounds like the most likely culprit. If I can't have wine, then you really shouldn't be able to either... something like that, I dunno. Which is obviously stupid.\nBut the way he's chosen to justify it makes no sense either. So NTA.", "Info: Is this just his opinion, or his dads too? Because if it's his dads then he's probably trying to get you on his dads good side and just frustrated you did something small like this. If his dad has nothing to do with it, he's probably just jealous and immature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall NTA with the info provided so far. But mate, this is what happens when you date someone with this legal gap while your both still mentally developing. He's being immature because he is immature. He'll grow out of it in a bit, but you shouldn't be surprised.", "NTA. When you are being treated to a meal, it's understood drinks are included. It was one drink. Your BF sounds very defensive. If that's controlling now, I'd watch him....", "NTA. Ordering one glass of wine is perfectly fine. When it doubt, follow the host\u2019s lead. Your hosts ordered a cocktail, so you were doubly fine to order a glass of wine. \n\nYour boyfriend is reacting this way because he feels insecure about being a kid while you\u2019re an adult (at least in the context of ordering alcohol.)", "NTA, and in the future if you are unsure... its not crazy to ask, especially if you know the family well enough to do so. Or just offer to pay up front if you are worried about it.", "NTA. His father didn't say \"I'll treat you to food but not drinks\". When you treat someone to a meal, that usually includes drinks, alcoholic or non. I think he's just salty that everyone was drinking except for him. Well, and his sister, but since she's not complaining, I don't see why he should.", "YTA  You should have offered to pay for your alcohol.  You say 1 glass but you say you got a cocktail like his wife and then a glass of wine.  One drink would have been okay but what does it say about you drinking with their 19 year old.  Agreed poor choice", "NTA why is he getting so bent out of shape on how his parents spend their money? If his parents had a problem with it they need to say what is acceptable to order when they treat the two of you for nice meal. If anything talk to them if they thought you ordering wine was rude or not and explain why your asking. I\u2019d also wonder why was it he only ordered water over other drink choices.", "NTA. The wine is normal at dinner, if you\u2019d ordered a smoothie or a milkshake it would\u2019ve came out almost the same price. You\u2019re right, it seems boyfriend is jealous he\u2019s not 21 yet.", "NTA. Your bf felt left out and acted like a child, proving why he\u2019s not mature enough to drink yet. You did absolutely nothing wrong by ordering a glass of wine.", "NTA - It is always a little awkward when someone else is paying for the meal. Since now you are self conscious of how much you spend. \n\nI would argue that as long as you don't go overkill they shouldn't mind.\n\nPlus your BF didn't pay for it, his dad did. So as long as his dad is fine with it, who cares what your BF thinks about the situation.", "NTA it was 9 $ not like 50 NTA", "NTA ordering a single glass of wine is a completely normal thing to do, and I think you hit it right on the head: he\u2019s feeling left out that he can\u2019t drink so he redirected those feelings into you doing something wrong. He\u2019ll get over it.", "I think that the question should be reposed as:\n\nAITA because by BF is insecure about the fact that my BF's father can buy us dinner out, while my BF cannot afford to.\n\nNTA. Your BF is insecure. Maybe so badly that he shouldn't be in a relationship.", "NTA\n\nWhat you did was very normal. It's not like you ordered a $50 pour of bourbon or anything. When someone offers to buy you dinner and they order drinks with their dinner, it's absolutely okay to also order a drink.", "NTA - this is normal and highlight how 19 and 21 can be a huge age difference. Ordering a glass of wine or cocktail with dinner is fine if someone else is paying.", "NTA-\n\nYour boyfriend is controlling. What other ways does he try to dictate what you are allowed to do?\n\nOrdering one fairly priced glass of wine is totally acceptable", "NTA- if he Dad didnt want to pay for your drink HE would have said.  Yup BF is all upset that he can't drink yet.", "NTA You ordered one glass of mid wine. Your BF is too in his head. Have him ask his parents if it was tacky, because I bet the don't even remember you ordering it.", "NTA but I\u2019ve learned over the years it\u2019s common courtesy to ALWAYS order the cheapest and most minimal thing when someone else ( that\u2019s not your partner or parents ) are paying for. \n\nTo me it\u2019s common courtesy BUT I know a lot of people don\u2019t know about that or believe in it which is okay too.", "NTA.  It was a painful reminder to your boyfriend that you are older and can do more.  Also, since his father ordered alcohol that was an invitation to the table to do likewise.", " NTA\n\nOthers are drinking cocktails, others are freely ordering whatever, correct? Why should you be any different?", "NTA. Your boyfriend is showing his feeling about realizing his girlfriend is at a different stage of her life than he is. If others were drinking and you ordered one drink that was less than $10 it\u2019s not a big deal and honestly expected if you enjoy alcohol. I would only call you TA if you had ordered multiple beverages.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm guessing that he was embarrassed that you are old enough to be drinking alcohol and he isn't.  My guess is that, at some point, the age difference between the two of you was mentioned by his parents, and not likely in a favorable way. I could be wrong.", "NTA.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You're of drinking age, and your boyfriends parents both ordered cocktails.  Also, they said it was a family dinner, and it sounds like they consider you family.  It would be a little different if neither of them had.  In that situation it would have been appropriate to ask if it was okay to order one.\n\nI remember being19/21 and on a tight budget.  Back then financial things seemed like a much bigger deal than they were.  Nine dollars for a glass of wine while eating out isn't a big thing.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend seems a bit bizarre.  The wine cost less than the cocktails.  Hell, these days a bleedin' Coke is $3.50 at a restaurant.  I personally try to never try to out-spend the person paying for a meal.  So I'll only get a cocktail if I happen to be the one paying.  I think you were fine, and didn't deserve to be verbally abused by your boyfriend.", "NTA, and your intuition is right. This isn't at all about money. Your choice to join the \"adults\" in imbibing drew a line between you three and the kids. He was on the wrong side of that line. He's insecure, but I don't know anyone who wouldn't be in his circumstances.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, wine with dinner is perfectly acceptable. Your bf\u2019s just pissed off that he\u2019s not old enough to drink.", "NTA", "When I take adults out to dinner I expect that they will likely order a glass of wine. If we all like the same kind, sometimes we get a bottle for the table. You behaved in a socially appropriate way, but it did highlight that your boyfriend isn't of age. I think you called it on his reason for being upset. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My boyfriend is 19. Neither of us are in a financial situation where we can go out to eat very often. Recently we were invited to dinner with his dad, stepmom and sister.

My feelings were hurt and I accused him of being embarrassed he isn't old enough to drink and I am. He said I was deflecting. I offered him $10, but he wouldn't take it. Is it asshole behavior to order alcohol on someone else's dime?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you'd ordered a bottle of Dom, big problem. A single glass of wine? You're boyfriend is being silly.", "NTA. It was not rude and tacky to order a glass of wine with dinner, especially since it was comparable in price to what other people ordered, and other people were drinking alcohol, too- including the people paying for the meal. Your boyfriend sounds immature and he\u2019s T A here.", "Nta", "NTA. You generally don't get something more expensive than what the host is having when they offer to buy you a dinner. If they're having a drink, you can, too. Same for dessert. You just generally shouldn't order something more expensive than what they're getting for themselves.\n\nYour boyfriend's reaction is odd. Was he raised to be frugal? If he was often told \"no\" growing up when he asked for something to drink other than water, he might have some emotional baggage about it. You should ask him why he thinks ordering drinks is a bad idea when someone else has offered to pay for dinner.\n\nWhen I'm buying dinner for someone, I want them to enjoy themselves. I don't want them to save me a few dollars by drinking water if they would really prefer something else.", "Nope, you\u2019re fine. Boyfriend is a bit strange though.", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely fine to order a single drink when someone offers to pay for dinner.", "NTA, when they treated you out they knew what it entailed, it's not disrespectful to order a reasonably priced drink, if anything they'd be TA if they offered to treat you, but got upset at you ordering anything other than the cheapest main course. Your boyfriend needs to get the stick out of his ass, he's not the one paying.", "NTA. I do think you should have asked permission to make it clear your intentions and find out if it was something they were okay with, but if they didn't say anything to you, then I think it must have been okay with them. I also think it's a little unfair of you to accuse your boyfriend of simply being embarrassed he's not old enough to drink. But overall, these things do not make you an asshole. If I were paying for relatives or friends by saying \"it's my treat\", I would probably personally lay out expectations like \"It's my treat, but I don't have a budget for alcohol.\" or \"It's my treat, but I only have the budget for us all to share a dessert\" or \"It's my treat, please get anything you'd like, regardless of price.\" Communication is a two-way street. If they didn't give you stipulations or complain themselves, then your boyfriend is offended on their behalf with no basis for that offense.", "What is rude and tacky is your boyfriend trying to embarrass you for ordering a drink at dinner.  My guess is he is projecting some issue here about not being able to legally drink or order alcohol when you can. His parents offered to treat you, if it bother him that much maybe he should have asked for a separate bill.", "NTA. In terms of money, you were clearly fine because your drink didn't cost much more than a non-alcoholic one would and you didn't order dessert. But sometimes alcoholic drinks are seen as \"extra\" in a way that other menu items aren't. You don't know where the parents stood on this. Bf might well be overreacting\n\nBest would have been I guess asking the parents if they minded you ordering a glass of wine, and going by their reaction (if they seemed awkward or hesitant, don't do it even if they said it would be okay).", "> The glass was $9. Both cocktails were $13. \n\nNTA - Follow the person who is paying.", "NTA.  Unless he has trauma-related triggers related to alcohol, there's  nothing wrong with drinking it.  Also, happy belated birthday.", "NTA. The hosts each ordered an alcoholic drink, your boyfriend's sister ordered a smoothie nearly as expensive as your wine, and your glass of wine was cheaper than the drinks the hosts ordered-- having a glass of wine at dinner out in those circumstances is very normal.", "While I think NTA, I also think I wouldn't have had any in the same situation.  I do partially, sorta, understand where he's coming from.", "NTA but if you wanna be a bit petty you can give his dad the ten dollars and apologize for overstepping. He'll probably ask what you are talking about. After that just let everything play out", "NAH, but I think the optics aren\u2019t very good. Also, parents may have slight concerns about the age gap. I can\u2019t really articulate it very well; but I think if your boyfriend is not drinking, then you shouldn\u2019t be drinking.  I would probably feel this way even if your boyfriend were old enough to drink. Maybe after getting to know his parents better it would be different.", "Parent myself of adult kids with partners and I have never blinked at them ordering alcohol when we are paying for them. So unless Australia is very different then NTA.", "That reminds me of the post a couple of weeks ago where the girlfriend ordered lobster at market price when her boyfriend's granny took them out for dinner for the first time.", "OP did not have a cocktail, that was what the parents ordered.", "She ordered wine, not a cocktail. And the dad and stepmom were also drinking with their 19yo.", "Your reading comprehension is out of whack,  If you think the OP is only the AH for getting two drinks then you should be changing your vote", "> You say 1 glass but you say you got a cocktail like his wife and then a glass of wine.\n\nCould you quote where the OP says this?", "I think it\u2019s more that he\u2019s not old enough to have a drink so he\u2019s all pissy about feeling left out.", "Thanks. I felt like maybe I broke some rule. I just became old enough to drink, so this is all new, but I feel like I'm too old to ask the rules without it being embarrassing.", "If the host is ordering a drink, apps, and a regular entr\u00e9e, there's no expectation for a guest to order the most minimal meal possible. Having someone sit there with a small salad or cup of soup while you're having a drink, an app, and a regular dinner sounds way more awkward than someone ordering a $9 glass of wine.", "The common courtesy is to match the order price of host/person paying. If they stick to a glass of water and a cup of soup, you get the something similar. No shame in ordering one cocktail if the host did as well.", "> I don't know anyone who wouldn't be in his circumstances.\n\nI do know plenty of people who wouldn't be insecure in this circumstance. As someone else pointed out, this is a problem with dating someone with this age gap at this age.  If the BF can't accept that his older partner can go out and drink and he can' then he shouldn't be in that relationship", "Exactly this.", "Oh sweet Jesus, people have no sense.", "I think its a mix of to young to drink and feeling poor. When i got my first job i refused to order anything on someone elses dime that i couldnt afford to buy myself. He may feel that he couldnt afford that so you shouldnt have gotten it and at this point he may feel mad based off of his principal or the situation.\nWhere i live you dont order alcohol on someone elses dime ever if your eating with someone and you want liquor you ask for the drink on a seperate check and pay that yourself", "I guess, everyone is entitled to their opinions. What OP did was standard for most families and individuals. It really depends how you\u2019re brought up.", "I\u2019m not shaming OP at all. I literally said NTA. I can see where you\u2019re coming from but to me I was raised to get the bare minimum if someone else is paying.", "Yep. Just that. \n\nYou order under what the host is ordering if it\u2019s not a common occurrence. \n\nOtherwise do as your past customs have dictated.", "Oh yeah? You know plenty of men who at 19 would have been confident at a dinner with their parents and 21 year old gf enjoying drinks, while they sip their water?\n\nI know a lot of dudes, and I can't think of any that would James Bond their way through this scenario.", "Yes... There are lots of normal people with normal emotions and reactions. Not everyone was a giant baby a year after they became an adult.\n\nIt's so bewildering that you consider not throwing a literal temper tantrum, or being upset by something so trivial to be \"James Bonding\" it.", "Yeah, around that age most people are sensitive to being \u201cnot quite\u201d an adult. I don\u2019t think I was ever in that situation, but I\u2019d have felt weird if my date ordered wine and I had to drink pop or whatever like the younger kids. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have said anything about it though.", "All I said was that he was insecure. I'm not defending the way he handled that.", "You did. By literally saying that no 19 year old man who isn't the international man of mystery would handle it any other way."]}
