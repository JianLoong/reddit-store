One year is nothing when you are grieving, and every one is entitled to grieve in their own way. Your family may be trying to help me, but they are going about it in a very inconsiderate way. I think you should tell them that. Openly. You may never be in the right headspace to meet a new man, and that is OK if that is what you want. Being with a man is not the most important thing in the world. Sure, if it is the right one, but you already had the right one. You wouldn't be an AH if you asked your family members to eff off and stop trying to manipulate you into dating another man. Take your time. Do what you want.", "Nta everyone gets over grief in different ways and in different time frames. You literally lost half of yourself when he passed. You need to do what\u2019s best for you and sounds like distancing yourself from your family is what\u2019s best for you rn", "NTA. It's your life and nobody can tell you how quickly you need to process such a massive loss. Even if it wasn't for your loss, trying to force you into relationships or dates that you don't want is disgusting in any context.", "NTA. The grief process is different for everyone. There is no right or wrong way to go about it. Find a grief counselor to help you deal with your mother\u2019s behavior. You may need to go very low contact with her until she accepts your boundaries. I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA. They need to give you space to grieve. It's insane to me that they would expect or encourage you to move on so fast. Some people never move on and that's okay too as long as you still live your life. I'm so sorry for your loss and that this is happening.", "NTA at all. Your mom sounds like a huge AH though. You'll know when you're ready to move forward in your own way.", "So this story is from a year ago? OP stated that just after her husband passed away, not even three months after he passed, they tried to get her to move on and join the dating world. \n\nNTA! Absolutely not. \n\nNo matter how much time has passed grief and pain are hard to heal from and people grieve and move on at different paces. Shoot my grandmother passed 16 years ago and I still miss her every day it hurts. (Obviously I\u2019m not comparing this to her husband) Only stating that sometimes never get over the pain of a loved one. You learn how to live with it and think of seeing them again one day. Hoping they would be proud of you and happy for you wherever they are, looking down on you, your husband is your Guardian Angel and they can\u2019t take him away from you. \n\nThat being said, you\u2019ve GOT to explain this to you family. Sit them down and tell them you are NOT DONE grieving your husband. That it\u2019s not going to change anytime soon especially if they keep pulling this crap. They cannot push you to move on and expect results because a grieving loved one needs love and support from those who matter to her.", "Oh dear! So sorry for your loss. Everyone grieves differently and no one should force you to move on \u201cfor your own good\u201c. \nI would go low contact for a while, start therapy and then once you feel comfortable get back in contact. Don\u2019t feel pressured to go their speed, they are not the one who lost their loved one! \nNTA at all!!! Stay strong!", "Nta pretty open and close", "NTA. No one gets lt tell you how or when to grieve. You will move at your own pace. They really are not coming from a good place. A person with your comfort in mind will ask what you need. Your family may think they want to help but it is really about them. Your grief makes them uncomfortable. That's a them problem. I am very sorry for your loss.", "NTA- cut them off, they are not trying to help", "NTA, I lost my dad a little over 2 years ago, I still get angry, sad, upset, everything sometimes, and that's ok.", "NTA. your mom (& family who behave like her) is the selfish one for being inconvenienced by your grief. take the space you need and spend your time with those who truly support you and will meet you where you are. \ni have to say i admire how honest you are with yourself about how hard this loss is hitting you. do all that you need to do to feel as ok and good as possible- now is the best time for you to be selfish (Abraham Hicks reference) \nYou seem like such a sweetheart and i send you my most sincere condolences. i wish you the very best!!", "Tell your parents that, \"I'm glad to know that when one of you eventually dies, I don't have to comfort you at all and that either of you will be moving on within three months. Really, it does comfort me because I won't have to do anything for you and it'll be just like another day. But to me, losing the person I love most in the world, the person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, it absolutely breaks my heart every day. I will not apologize for taking the time I need, I am not as cold as you two. And since none of you can respect my boundaries, making everything and everyday harder for me, I am going to distance myself from you. You need to stop. I'll heal from this in my own time. But that's my decision. \"", "NTA. No one gets to decide for you how long you grieve a loss. Your mother and any of her flying monkeys who agree with her deserve to cool their heals on timeout and wait on you 1) to work through the grieving process and 2) to forgive them their meddling, should you so choose!", "NTA. When I lost my husband, I left his boots under the coffee table and would dust them and move them to vacuum and put them back.  For months.  His coffee cup stayed by the sink for at least a year. There is no timeline for grief.  \n\nYour mom is not allowing you any boundaries.  She is the AH for pushing you like this! There is no reason for her to do this and your dating life is NONE of her business.  I would put her in a long time out.  You do not need this added stress.\n\nI will say that grief counseling helped me a lot.  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  Take the time YOU need.  Take care of YOURSELF.  You\u2019re the one that matters.  It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business how you handle your life.", "NTA. Put your mother and your family in time-out. When they can treat you with respect, they can try being decent family again. No support  would be better than their 'help'.", "I agree I lost my mom almost 3 years ago and still have extremely bad days. The bad ones are becoming less frequent", ">So this story is from a year ago? OP stated that just after her husband passed away, not even three months after he passed, they tried to get her to move on and join the dating world. \n\nWorse than that. It's only been about a year since he *passed*. And they've been bugging her for the past *9 months*.\n\nA year is *nothing*. I mean, if they were bugging her after five years it would still be problematic, but seriously? Barely a season passed before they were trying to get her back on the dating scene? \n\nHonestly, OP needs to distance herself from these people. They *may* mean well, but holy crap are they not helping. The road to hell is paved with good intentions..."]}
