One year is nothing when you are grieving, and every one is entitled to grieve in their own way. Your family may be trying to help me, but they are going about it in a very inconsiderate way. I think you should tell them that. Openly. You may never be in the right headspace to meet a new man, and that is OK if that is what you want. Being with a man is not the most important thing in the world. Sure, if it is the right one, but you already had the right one. You wouldn't be an AH if you asked your family members to eff off and stop trying to manipulate you into dating another man. Take your time. Do what you want.", "Nta everyone gets over grief in different ways and in different time frames. You literally lost half of yourself when he passed. You need to do what\u2019s best for you and sounds like distancing yourself from your family is what\u2019s best for you rn", "NTA. It's your life and nobody can tell you how quickly you need to process such a massive loss. Even if it wasn't for your loss, trying to force you into relationships or dates that you don't want is disgusting in any context.", "NTA. The grief process is different for everyone. There is no right or wrong way to go about it. Find a grief counselor to help you deal with your mother\u2019s behavior. You may need to go very low contact with her until she accepts your boundaries. I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA. They need to give you space to grieve. It's insane to me that they would expect or encourage you to move on so fast. Some people never move on and that's okay too as long as you still live your life. I'm so sorry for your loss and that this is happening.", "NTA at all. Your mom sounds like a huge AH though. You'll know when you're ready to move forward in your own way.", "So this story is from a year ago? OP stated that just after her husband passed away, not even three months after he passed, they tried to get her to move on and join the dating world. \n\nNTA! Absolutely not. \n\nNo matter how much time has passed grief and pain are hard to heal from and people grieve and move on at different paces. Shoot my grandmother passed 16 years ago and I still miss her every day it hurts. (Obviously I\u2019m not comparing this to her husband) Only stating that sometimes never get over the pain of a loved one. You learn how to live with it and think of seeing them again one day. Hoping they would be proud of you and happy for you wherever they are, looking down on you, your husband is your Guardian Angel and they can\u2019t take him away from you. \n\nThat being said, you\u2019ve GOT to explain this to you family. Sit them down and tell them you are NOT DONE grieving your husband. That it\u2019s not going to change anytime soon especially if they keep pulling this crap. They cannot push you to move on and expect results because a grieving loved one needs love and support from those who matter to her.", "Oh dear! So sorry for your loss. Everyone grieves differently and no one should force you to move on \u201cfor your own good\u201c. \nI would go low contact for a while, start therapy and then once you feel comfortable get back in contact. Don\u2019t feel pressured to go their speed, they are not the one who lost their loved one! \nNTA at all!!! Stay strong!", "Nta pretty open and close", "NTA. No one gets lt tell you how or when to grieve. You will move at your own pace. They really are not coming from a good place. A person with your comfort in mind will ask what you need. Your family may think they want to help but it is really about them. Your grief makes them uncomfortable. That's a them problem. I am very sorry for your loss.", "NTA- cut them off, they are not trying to help", "NTA, I lost my dad a little over 2 years ago, I still get angry, sad, upset, everything sometimes, and that's ok.", "NTA. your mom (& family who behave like her) is the selfish one for being inconvenienced by your grief. take the space you need and spend your time with those who truly support you and will meet you where you are. \ni have to say i admire how honest you are with yourself about how hard this loss is hitting you. do all that you need to do to feel as ok and good as possible- now is the best time for you to be selfish (Abraham Hicks reference) \nYou seem like such a sweetheart and i send you my most sincere condolences. i wish you the very best!!", "Tell your parents that, \"I'm glad to know that when one of you eventually dies, I don't have to comfort you at all and that either of you will be moving on within three months. Really, it does comfort me because I won't have to do anything for you and it'll be just like another day. But to me, losing the person I love most in the world, the person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with, it absolutely breaks my heart every day. I will not apologize for taking the time I need, I am not as cold as you two. And since none of you can respect my boundaries, making everything and everyday harder for me, I am going to distance myself from you. You need to stop. I'll heal from this in my own time. But that's my decision. \"", "NTA. No one gets to decide for you how long you grieve a loss. Your mother and any of her flying monkeys who agree with her deserve to cool their heals on timeout and wait on you 1) to work through the grieving process and 2) to forgive them their meddling, should you so choose!", "NTA. When I lost my husband, I left his boots under the coffee table and would dust them and move them to vacuum and put them back.  For months.  His coffee cup stayed by the sink for at least a year. There is no timeline for grief.  \n\nYour mom is not allowing you any boundaries.  She is the AH for pushing you like this! There is no reason for her to do this and your dating life is NONE of her business.  I would put her in a long time out.  You do not need this added stress.\n\nI will say that grief counseling helped me a lot.  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  Take the time YOU need.  Take care of YOURSELF.  You\u2019re the one that matters.  It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business how you handle your life.", "NTA. Put your mother and your family in time-out. When they can treat you with respect, they can try being decent family again. No support  would be better than their 'help'.", "I agree I lost my mom almost 3 years ago and still have extremely bad days. The bad ones are becoming less frequent", ">So this story is from a year ago? OP stated that just after her husband passed away, not even three months after he passed, they tried to get her to move on and join the dating world. \n\nWorse than that. It's only been about a year since he *passed*. And they've been bugging her for the past *9 months*.\n\nA year is *nothing*. I mean, if they were bugging her after five years it would still be problematic, but seriously? Barely a season passed before they were trying to get her back on the dating scene? \n\nHonestly, OP needs to distance herself from these people. They *may* mean well, but holy crap are they not helping. The road to hell is paved with good intentions...", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your husband and I hope you can find peace someday \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "NTA - your mum was trying to pimp you out to make her life better.  \nDon\u2019t go back there.  \nTell her you can\u2019t trust her to not do it again.  \nYou were a lot calmer than I would have been.", "This is so heartbreaking to read, you are absolutely NTA. Death changes us at our fundamental core. This death traumatized you and SISTER THATS OKAY! Trauma changes us, there's science to prove what it does and how it changes our brains and our core selves. Honey grieve this wonderful human for as long as you need, and please reach out to any of us and your friends when you need someone to talk to or validate your feelings. We are all here for you, always. Everyone in this comment section does care, I'm sure of it! It's not living in the past at all. It sounded like he was the family you needed and deserved, I myself am so sorry he's gone. He must have been so wonderful. People need different amounts of time to grieve and I'm sorry your mom isn't open to that at all, it sounds like she hasn't had much death in her life which is a blessing but also a bit of a curse. Death brings us together, it reminds us to continue to love and to hold onto each other even tighter. It might be best to distance yourself from them which is such a shame because they should be there for you in a different way than they are right now, more than ever. I'm sure you've told her that you appreciate what she's trying to do, but that the route she's taking to get to whatever goal she has to make you move on, isn't working and it's pushing you away. Please reach out if you ever need a friend. I'm sure you have many but we are so here for you.", "NTA. I lost my husband April 19 of this year and people are already pulling the same crap as your mom. One nice thing, my mom made sure growing up I had a stainless steel chrome plated spine. I have let it be known to family and friends,  try, me and find out I know too much crap to rip your worlds apart. The worst have been people at church, I don't mind group gatherings I think it's good for me ( no family in my state) but I do not need to know every single male from 40 - 60s dating profiles. Stay firm and if you have to cut them off for a few months.", "OP, my sister died just over two years ago. it still feels like yesterday. she died in my arms, in hospital, surrounded by love and music. but I still have PTSD from her death. I still can't bear so many things. I can't listen to the music she loved, watch her favourite movies, or go to her favourite swimming pool.\n\nyour parents are honestly being really horrible by trying to force you to move on so soon. I'm so sorry you're being treated like this.\n\nI've been with my husband since I was 14 & if he died I can genuinely say I don't think I could keep living. so you are doing so amazing. I'm in awe of your strength.\n \nNTA of course", "NTA.\n\nThey need to back off.  While it's not a decision factor (they 100% are the AH's, not you), you said you were with your husband since 15, how old are you now?  The longer the relationship the longer it usually takes people to heal from this kind of loss, by leaps and bounds.\n\nI honestly suggest that given the data provided you got LC or even NC with them if they won't respect your wishes.  Throwing out his things or cologne, setting you up on ambush dates, all fully unacceptable!  And if this is how they \"support you\", you neither want nor need them \"helping\".\n\nSorry for your loss, take whatever time you need, don't let anyone rush you.", "NTA. A year isn\u2019t a long time and being single is fine. Did they kill him?", "NTA\n\n\"everyone had let me know how disappointed they are about my actions\"\n\ni know you want to believe that what they did came from a good place but please excuse me? you are the disappointment of the family because you still grieve a beloved person?\n\ni would go full nc with the whole family over this...", "NTA\n\nMight be extreme but go no contact with them for a month. \n\nIf they haven't improved after that I'd be cutting then out a bit more permanently", "NTA. Your family are gigantic, gaping assholes. They should be supporting you unconditionally in your grief. To start pushing you to forget the love of your life after 3 months, is abusive.\n\nIs there anyone who does support you in your grief? Tell your family you won\u2019t see them again until they\u2019re there to support you instead of trying to destroy you.", "NTA - Your mum and family need to back the F off. \n\nWishing you well thoughts and hoping you have a support network/person to assist you when needed.", "NTA", "I lost my 25 years ago, I still feel all of those things regularly", "The same thing happened to my dad after he lost his first wife- obviously to some family members he wasn\u2019t moving on as quickly as he should so they would set him up on dates without him knowing and send them to his house, so he\u2019d open the door and they\u2019d be all enthusiastic like \u201cI\u2019m here for our date\u201d and even though he\u2019d feel bad, he\u2019d send them away because he was just not ready. And I\u2019m pretty sure he thought that\u2019d be the case but he met my mum- and she was awesome, they got engaged four months later and the rest is history!"]}
