I guess what I\u2019m asking is do I deserve all the anger that my sisters are directing at me?\n\nI have two sisters. I\u2019m 23, they are 28 (Bec) and 29 (Ada) . Both have kids, I don\u2019t. We planned to do a family day at a local lake yesterday. My 29 year old sister\u2019s FIL got sepsis so she had to fly out and asked me to take her two kids to the lake. I said sure. Edit: I\u2019m also staying at her house until she gets home, this was badly worded. I was not just taking them to the lake. \n\nI thought it would be ok even though I have a massive fear of open water (or sharks specifically). It came from when we went to California as kids and I loved the ocean. Then however the brain works, I had massive nightmares about being grabbed by sharks and I\u2019ve really never swam again. I can go in pools as long as I can touch and see the bottom but a lane, pond, pool at night, etc\u2026 will leave me with a pure panic attack. \n\nWe got to the lake yesterday and I started freaking out in my head. I was ok on the outside but in the inside all I could envision was some sort of shark grabbing my niece and nephew and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about. So I did not let them swim. They cried of course and Bec said I was being ridiculous. I said I know but I can\u2019t help it. She called Ada and she told me to let them go in the water, that Bec would he responsible for them. I agreed. But as soon as they even dipping their toes in, I freaked out and told them no, they had to stay on the beach. Bec screamed at me that she\u2019s just as related to the kids as I am and she\u2019s overruling me. I grabbed both kids and loaded them in the car and we left. We went to see the Taylor swift movie and had a great time and they were happy. \n\nI came out of the movie to about 200 missed angry calls and texts for Ada and Bec about not knowing where I was, me not telling them where I was going while acting so irrationally, etc\u2026 I guess about an hour in the remembered that check FindMy Ana saw we were at a movie so that calmed down but Ada ripped me a new one when I finally called her back and made me feel like such an asshole. I tried to defend myself but she literally told me \u201cthere\u2019s no defense for what you did today, you will never watch my kids again.\u201d \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697459699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1794y7s/aita_for_not_allowing_my_niece_and_nephew_to_swim/", "score": 1299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, Bec was there, right? You handed the two kids off to Bec. You were free to handle your panic on your own.\n\nYou should have left, alone, at that point.\n\nYTA massively.", "YTA for two reasons.\n\nOne.. You cannot push your irrational fears onto kids. Your other sister was going to watch them and be responsible for them and you still said no. I have anxiety and some things make me very uncomfortable when playing with my 6yo. Eg. If she wants to climb really high on a playground. I remove myself from the situation. I tell hubby that I'm going for a walk and let them do their thing. She grows confident and I control my fears by removing myself from the situation.\n\nTwo.. you packed the kids up, took them somewhere, and were then uncontactable. Any parent would be fuming if they didn't know where you suddenly took their kids.", "Yes, YTA. You know what you did was wrong. You took your trauma and paranoia out on children, then took them *without telling their parents where they were*, instead of leaving them with the aunt who *wasn't* freaking out *per their parents' instructions.* \n\nYou basically kidnapped your niece and nephew for two hours, creating a HUGE panic for the parents, because you were acting irrationally. \n\nYou *should* feel like an AH about it, and you *shouldn't* be trying to defend yourself, you *should* be apologizing profusely and getting help.", "It's not about the swimming thing,  it's about you taking your nibblings somewhere else for hours without notifying their parents. There was another adult there that you could have left the kids with but instead you ran off with them without a word. Of course you're not going to be allowed to babysit again.  YTA", "YTA, you kidnapped two children after having a mental health episode. This is terrifying. You cannot abscond with other peoples children.", "YTA. You are the epitome of \"it scares me so therefore no one is allowed to do it. \"", "Oh course, YTA. But your post seems to know that already. Why are you posting for a judgement when you already know?\n\nYour irrational fears are your own and you shouldn\u2019t be trying to force them on others, then running off with someone else\u2019s kids. \n\nI\u2019d be like your sisters here and never trust you again with me kids.", "Uh, big YTA. \n\nLike, so much. \n\nYou pretty much kidnapped the kids, are you kidding me? I cannot imagine the amount of fear their mother had. \n\nBesides, if you're so afraid of big bodies of water, why would you agree to take the kids to the lake? That was incredibly poor planning on your part. And once you realized you were freaking out, why didn't you ask Bec to watch over the kids while you went to take a breather? Why, once Ada told you that she was giving the responsibility to watch the kids over to your other sister did you think it was appropriate to straight-up kidnap them instead of leaving them to enjoy their day? \n\nYou are right that you most likely need therapy to overcome your fear, but that is not the most glaring issue here.", "YTA.  Lakes don't have sharks.  You don't mention how old the kids are, but both of their mothers said it was ok for them to swim in the lake.  You wigged out and didn't tell the mothers where you were going...  hence the missed calls and texts.", "YTA. You clearly have a big trauma if you are scared a shark would grab your nephew and nieces... in a LAKE. \n\nYou are not an asshole for having a phobia. But you are definitely an asshole for projecting your trauma on children, preventing them from having fun and making them afraid of the water for no reasons.\n\nYou need to see someone about that phobia : it's irrational and it's not healthy. I would understand if you were scared of sharks in shark-infested water. But in a lake, where there are zero sharks living... this is not normal.", "You grabbed both kids, put them in the car & did not communicate to anyone where you were taking them? Those poor kids. I don\u2019t blame your sisters for being upset with you.\n\nYTA \u2014 yes you deserve all the anger. What you did was ridiculously irresponsible & reckless.", "Yta so you just took 2 kids without their parents' permission and didn't respond to texts or call for two hours?  \ud83e\udd14", "YTA. Also, as you already said, you need therapy (I mean fearing a shark attack in a pond?) . \n\nYou'll just end up projecting your fears onto your nieces and nephews and having them ebd up with the same irrational fears without them being able to learn how to swim or enjoy the water.", "Never ever ever go swimming with young children if you don't have a swimming-capable adult and preferably two.\n\nYTA for getting into that situation in the first place, when you know your own limitations. YTA for driving off with them also.", "YTA, they may not fear the water, but they'll sure as hell fear you after that. You violated the trust of their parents and the kids. You fucked up bad. Go to therapy.", "YTA\n\nI know you were scared, but it was too irrational--with the mother giving permission and your other sister there, I think you should have let them in the water.\n\nThen, to leave with the children and not tell them where you were going nor send them a text when you got there was pretty bad.", "YTA\nI get the phobia for open water. But when your sister allowed you to hand the kids off to another relative it was no longer your responsibility, or your privilege to care for the children. Taking the children away and ghosting everyone for 3 hours was a total a****** move.", "YTA. Yes, you deserve all the anger, you're untrustworthy, have no respect for your sisters and their parenting, ang hugely overstepped. I really hope you aren't allowed to watch the kids again, you've shown you can't be trusted with them.", "YTA and deserve the anger. You have also damaged the relationship with your sisters and niece and nephew over nothing. You need to see a professional for your completely irrational fear. You weren\u2019t even afraid of them drowning you were afraid of *sharks* in a *lake*. You know sharks don\u2019t live in lakes. But your fear of something you know is impossible allowed you to freak out and actually scare children and take away and experience from them and make yourself look crazy. This is affecting your life and relationships and you need help.", "Of course YTA. And yes, you deserve the anger. Because at that point, the children\u2019s MOTHER had put someone else in charge of them. At that point, they were no longer your responsibility. \n\nYou should have simply left if you couldn\u2019t handle it and returned to pick them up.", "YTA.... sorry. But didn't your sister know about your problem beforehand? If she did know, it would've been wiser for her to ask Bec to be responsible for all 4 kids. I completely understand panic and similar feelings. \n\nBut please think about how this will impact the two kids - they probably need someone to sit them down and have a talk with them about what happened. I feel it would affect them psychologically otherwise. BTW... the writer of the Jaws book felt bad for giving sharks such a bad rap - poor things - their numbers have decreased significantly after the movies came out. Plus, sharks are not in lakes.\n\nI feel when Ada specifically said Bec would be responsible for the kids, you could've backed out or even left the particular spot. Just walked a few meters away and faced the other way so that you were not interfering with a perfectly happy family picnic.", "Yta\n\nWhen your own irrational fears start affecting others, get help. \n\nThen the biggest ah part, you took someone else's kids from where you were supposed to be watching them, went somewhere without telling anyone where, then you went completely off the radar for a couple hours. You should have sent their mother a text *before* you left the lake.", "YTA. You have no defense. Being afraid of open water is one thing, but you said your specific fear is of sharks; sharks usually don't live in freshwater lakes so you've lost me there. \n\nAda has every right to rip you a new one. You've proven yourself untrustworthy and given to flights of rash behavior. Ada gave her children permission to go swimming. Bec was going to watch them, and you still behaved irrationally by yanking the kids out of there and then going incommunicado for 2 hours and 48 minutes. \n\nYou'd never be watching my kids again. You're lucky neither Ada or Bec called the police and reported them missing. Doesn't matter if you're their ad hoc guardian at the moment, you were behaving irrationally and they couldn't get a hold of you. \n\nYou know you're the AH, so why did you come here seeking judgement? What you need is therapy and not excuses.", "Massive YTA. You cannot disappear with someone\u2019s kids for hours. And look I get anxiety. But if someone asked me to take their kid to a stadium concert I\u2019d say no in a second because large crowds like that give me panic. I know that about myself. I wouldn\u2019t put myself in that situation with two children in tow", "You'd never be left alone with my kids again, that's for sure.", "YTA. I feel like when your sister said Bec would be responsible you should have backed off. You\u2019re an adult and while I sympathise with your trauma, you cannot let it affect your nieces nor overrule their parent like that. And driving off with them was definitely over the top. Your sisters aren\u2019t overreacting at all.", "YTA. You kindnapped some kids for hours due to your uncontrolled mental illness.", "YTA. First you know you have an irrational fear of open water and yet you accepted to take the kids to the lake, you should have told your sister and let them go with your other sister instead of ruining their outing and passing your fear to the kids, that's a jerk move.\n\nThen you overruled the kid's mother by not allowing the kids to go into the lake in the care of your other sister.\n\nAnd on top of it you took off with the kids and became unreachable for hours, it doesn't matter you shared your location you weren't answering, and yet you are wondering if you deserve your sister's anger? God you are such a huge AH.\n\nListen you are an adult and you decide if you deal or not with your irrational fears, but you can't used it as an excuse to act like crazy or do things like disappear with two kids. You screw up, the least you could do is apologize and realize that she is right by no wanting you to watch over her kids ever.", "Ain\u2019t no sharks in a lake. Seek therapy", "YTA\n\nAnd way to go, possibly passing on your irrational fears to your niece and nephew.\n\nI bet this is the last time you're put in charge of anyone's kids.", "YTA, like a huge one. You let YOUR fears and YOUR anxiety hinder your niece and nephew from having a great time. You have an irrational fear of water that you clearly made up in your head and that\u2019s something you personally should work on but you\u2019re a huge dick for pushing your issues and fears on children wanting to have fun and enjoy swimming.", "You are setting up the kids to have irrational fears. You don't realize how psychologically damaging this can be to a kid. When my nephew was 4, his dad let him watch the movie Jaws, and someone else told him that tuna was shark meat. This kid would lose his ever loving mind if you gave him a tuna sandwich my friend when she was a child, was made to fear spider so much that, even as an adult, she would get hysterical if she saw even a small spider. Please get some help to deal with these intrusive thoughts before you spread it to the kids.", "YTA lakes do not have sharks and you need help.", "YTA. Thank goodness you don't have children. They'd be wrecks from the trauma you'd put on them.\n\nGet professional help.\n\nNothing you did was rational.", "Why are you even asking this\n\nYes\n\nLearn to aunt", "Ah, the dreaded lake sharks! This is why Jaws should be banned (joking, but it did traumatize a generation). Obviously YTA, and you're very clear on that already, so I'm not sure what feedback you want here. Your behaviour was incredibly over-the-top, and your own paranoia does not excuse it. You could have left your sister in charge. You should have told both sisters where you took the kids after you left in a panic. You likely scared the hell out of everyone. I'm glad they had fun at the film, but I might not let you look after my kids again either after that breakdown.", "YTA and a fucking child, please get some help", "YTA and also an idiot", "YTA. Everything aside, did you ever consider that you could have passed your own intense phobia off to the kids, and they would have the same panic you experience? Do you want them to be deprived of beach days, lake days, night swimming, etc?", "YTA, get help for your anxiety and realise that others are allowed to make their own choice to swim and it\u2019s not your business", "YTA! Massively. Keeping your fear for open lakes aside, what you did was immensely reckless and immature. \n\nYou as your niece and nephew's designated sitter had the responsibility to inform your sister of your whereabouts. You can't expect her to track all your moves, especially when her FIL is having a medical emergency.\n\nThe backlash and lashing you are getting are all very well deserved.", "On the bright side, you don't have to babysit anymore.", "Girl, you're lucky they didn't call the cops because damn. If my sibling ran off with my kids for hours with no contact, that's what I'd have been doing.", "Ya you sound like a burden to be around and honestly really lame. YTA", "YTA and the reasons are plentiful\nYou agreed to an outing that you knew you could not handle\nYou did not listen to the mother when she told you to allow them to swim\nYou took off with the kids without the parents permission", "YTA. You didn't accept that someone else was put in charge and disappeared with the children. Your fear is so extremely irrational you should have never accepted to watch anyone by a body of water.", "YTA. But it's not about the swimming it's about taking off with them without telling anyone where you were going. You were supposed to be helping out your sister, how does what you did help her. She sees you as unfit to be in charge of kids, and I can't say I blame her.", "You\u2019re projecting your own fears onto others. You deserve everything that comes your way. You seriously need to see a therapist", "YTA for disappearing with her kids and not letting mom know where you went. \n\nYTA for letting your fears impact your niece and nephew. I would hate to see them learn to fear the water because they see you fear it so much. You\u2019re NTA for being afraid but YTA for taking your niece and nephew to a lake and refusing to let them swim because you are afraid of open water. Even when there was another trusted adult there to asymmetric lifeguard duties and mom\u2019s permission, you STILL refused and then left with the kids without updating mom on her children\u2019s location.

Do this now, before you have kids of your own and traumatize them.", "YTA. You acted very immaturely by taking them, leaving, and not telling anyone where you went.

Get some help dude.  Good luck.", "YTA. Honestly you should never have agreed to take them swimming knowing how severe your phobia is.

Not sure why you even needed to ask this. It wasn't a situation where you were the only 'responsible' adult present.

So you don't get to decide they can't swim when their mom already said it was okay. You also showed you don't trust Bec. You're wrong and selfish to force other people to make sacrifices because of your fear. You're wrong to refuse to pick up the phone when your sister is trying to call about HER kids. You never should have taken them away and refused to answer your phone for hours. If I were her, I would have called the cops on you. You deserve to be held accountable for this.

We planned to do a family day at a local lake yesterday. My 29 year old sister\u2019s FIL got sepsis so she had to fly out and asked me to take her two kids to the lake. I said sure. \n\nI thought it would be ok even though I have a massive fear of open water (or sharks specifically). It came from when we went to California as kids and I loved the ocean. Then however the brain works, I had massive nightmares about being grabbed by sharks and I\u2019ve really never swam again. I can go in pools as long as I can touch and see the bottom but a lane, pond, pool at night, etc\u2026 will leave me with a pure panic attack. \n\nWe got to the lake yesterday and I started freaking out in my head. I was ok on the outside but in the inside all I could envision was some sort of shark grabbing my niece and nephew and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about. So I did not let them swim. They cried of course and Bec said I was being ridiculous. I said I know but I can\u2019t help it. She called Ada and she told me to let them go in the water, that Bec would he responsible for them. I agreed. But as soon as they even dipping their toes in, I freaked out and told them no, they had to stay on the beach. Bec screamed at me that she\u2019s just as related to the kids as I am and she\u2019s overruling me. I grabbed both kids and loaded them in the car and we left. We went to see the Taylor swift movie and had a great time and they were happy. \n\nI came out of the movie to about 200 missed angry calls and texts for Ada and Bec about not knowing where I was, me not telling them where I was going while acting so irrationally, etc\u2026 I guess about an hour in the remembered that check FindMy Ana saw we were at a movie so that calmed down but Ada ripped me a new one when I finally called her back and made me feel like such an asshole.

There's also no fucking way they didn't try and call or message you during what could basically be described as kidnapping since you were relieved of duty by the mother by her transferring responsibility of the kids to Bec and you deciding then to take them away.", "Once again as the above comment explains you don't get to \"surprised pikachu face\" after not responding to the mother's calls for 2 hours without saying anything to anyone regarding where you were going and her being pissed at you over it", "Okay! How do you expect your sister to keep a track of your locations when her FIL was in hospital fighting a sepsis infection? Just how?", "You freaked off and ran off with her kids. A person isn't going to necessarily think about looking at your shared location.

Of course she would be worried someone who is acting irrationally has left with her kids without a word and she is hours away unable to do anything.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you share locations. She wasn\u2019t thinking about that bc she was panicked by the REALITY that the person she entrusted her children to isn\u2019t mentally fit to care for a frog, let alone children. You were in meltdown mode and ran off with her children. You took an already stressful situation for your sister and made it just that much worse. \n\nYou panicked over some irrational BS but want to act like your sister should have just checked your location when she was in the middle of a panic attack brought on by YOUR behavior.", "You're lucky they didn't call the cops. Person in the middle of a panic attack put a 6&2 year old into a car and drives away to do who knows what?

Really?", "And how is that supposed to let her know her kids were ok? That just lets her know where your phone is, not what you\u2019re doing and why tf you suddenly disappeared.", "Why are you arguing? This isn't the venting subreddit,.it's AITA. You asked whether you deserve the reaction you got, and have been told by consensus, that reaction was warranted. I never understood this. YTA, own it.", "She shouldn't have to do that. You should have sticked to the plan! If you don't understand that, you can't take care of other's people kids", "And YOU could have let the kids swim under the supervision of your sister.", "Legally speaking, I'm pretty sure you quite literally kidnapped your nibblings by doing what you did, though IANAL and it depends on jurisdiction yadda yadda but you were not their legal guardian and you did not tell their legal guardian where you were taking them, and you can NEVER assume permission to take anyone else's children anywhere, it must be explicit.\n\nAs someone who also suffers from panic attacks, I feel you, I really do. They are completely overwhelming and cause even the most rational people to do really stupid things. But you did a bad thing, it is that simple. I really hope you do get counseling, but you have to understand that you literally kidnapped and put those children in danger with your actions. I can say that with some confidence because I know from experience that if you are having a panic attack bad enough to make you react the way you did, you should NOT be driving. Panic attacks can cause you to pass out or dissociate, especially if they are severe. If you (or anyone else reading this) suffer a panic attack while driving or just before you drive, do not drive. Pull over when safe (or don't drive in the car), calm down, and then continue your drive. It can wait for a few minutes, better that than risking your life or someone else's.\n\nI'm not saying you deserve to be punished. I'm not saying you should never be allowed to babysit again. But if you're having panic attacks as severe as you describe, you should probably not be in charge of people's safety, especially around your triggers. That isn't always unavoidable, but in this case it was, and you now know for the future not to do anything that you did again. Which includes how you reacted after your panic set in", "And you *could* have managed your anxieties better, yet here we are", "OR you could have answered their mother and listened to her requests.

If I had been one of the adults there and witnessed that spectacle, I would have jumped in my car to follow them, while calling police, then the kids' parent. Her mental state was such that I'd be worried about her driving safely. Were the kids buckled in properly? How was she driving? Where is she going?", "So you just gave yourself yet another chance to be called an asshole.

Eight is so few.", "Also, Lake Pontchartrain has been polluted for some time, and you have the added threat of alligator gar.
