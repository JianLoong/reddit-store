I don't know if they will listen, but at least you said something. \n\nMy daughter's husband does zero chores around the house, she struggles with this.  His mother has apologized to my daughter over and over for raising all her sons this way.

There is no excuse for not teaching your sons domestic tasks.", "NTA, you're 100% right and told them the truth.

But your mother is probably acting this way because of how she was raised herself, so its not necessarily intentionally. You could have just stood your ground and kept repeating how your brothers are to do them. I can perfectly see how you got mad over it tho and I think its perfectly justified and ok. But as a family you can probably be glad you dont have any serious issues if its just about some group chat about chores and some tiny differences lol", "NTA... this happens way to often.

But also making a fair point.", "NTA", "NTA and good on you for calling out bs misogynistic double standards.", "I don't want to use the word asshole here, but you were disrespectful, and truthfully honest. I am on your side with the chore thing. \n\nDaily chore changes are difficult. At my house there were 3 kids, so the chores were separated into 3 categories. 1) kitchen, 2) livingroom/ dinning room, and 3) the two bathrooms. Each week, we kept our assignments clean. On Saturday, you deep cleaned your assignment. Once finished, it belonged to the next sister on the list. If you didn't finish before noon, you had two assignments until the deep cleaning was done. You also could not go out until the deep cleaning was done. Basically, if you didn't scour the sink and wash the kitchen floor before dinner, you also had to do the dinner dishes. \n\nWith your mom defending the boys, that won't  work. I would get her alone, with you and your sis, and address it calmly. That way she is not defending herself in front of the family. \n\nTell her it is unfair for tasks to be assigned to them, then be told to do them. Ask her why you girls are both responsible for chores when they aren't.  Ask her if she thinks it is 1960. \n\nIf she tells you to do their chores again, say no. When she screams or demands it, say \"at least I am being honest. The boys say they will do their chores, then don't.  That is not my chore to do\". Or, \"sure, I will do as good a job as brother would\".\n\nOr pull a boy move, stay out of the house or just don't answer the phone!\n\nI do feel you and your sister are getting screwed. Arguing over dinner is not the answer though. Try anything else. What you did gave them an excuse to ignore the issue with the boys and focus on your behavior instead. You need to keep the focus on the boys if you want results.", "No you're truthful.  And older people have issues with someone telling them they suck at parenting! Especially their own kids!\n\nMy parents raised us gender neutral.  My brother can cook, clean, do laundry and even sew!! My sister and I can mow laws, shingle roofs and I can ARC weld!  We also got basic car care (oil changes, flats, carburetor adjustment and so on.)\nI raised my girls the same way.  We want gender strong women, not helpless Lily's.", "NTA, I told my grandma the same thing earlier this year because she always asks the women in my family to help set up for meals and holiday celebrations (which we're happy to help with of course) but never the men. The realization dawned on her and she immediately began tasks to all the men (which they were also happy to do, I'm blessed to have a lot of wonderful men in my family who were too simple to offer to help) I just told her that since no woman in my generation is going to put up with any man who doesn't contribute his fair share, she's doing my brothers and cousins a disservice by 1) conditioning them to believe contributions are not expected of them and 2) not giving them the opportunity to learn the skills they'll need to contribute equally to a household. She was actually ecstatic and had a lot of fun giving the girls a break at our last holiday meal and having the boys learn everything us girls have been doing for years. She actually thanked me for telling her; people need to retain that kind of flexibility as they age, to change as the world is changing. My grandma is awesome :)", "Because they don't have a dick between their legs."]}
