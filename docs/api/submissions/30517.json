I am on your side with the chore thing. \n\nDaily chore changes are difficult. At my house there were 3 kids, so the chores were separated into 3 categories. 1) kitchen, 2) livingroom/ dinning room, and 3) the two bathrooms. Each week, we kept our assignments clean. On Saturday, you deep cleaned your assignment. Once finished, it belonged to the next sister on the list. If you didn't finish before noon, you had two assignments until the deep cleaning was done. You also could not go out until the deep cleaning was done. Basically, if you didn't scour the sink and wash the kitchen floor before dinner, you also had to do the dinner dishes. \n\nWith your mom defending the boys, that won't  work. I would get her alone, with you and your sis, and address it calmly. That way she is not defending herself in front of the family. \n\nTell her it is unfair for tasks to be assigned to them, then be told to do them. Ask her why you girls are both responsible for chores when they aren't.  Ask her if she thinks it is 1960. \n\nIf she tells you to do their chores again, say no. When she screams or demands it, say \"at least I am being honest. The boys say they will do their chores, then don't.  That is not my chore to do\". Or, \"sure, I will do as good a job as brother would\".\n\nOr pull a boy move, stay out of the house or just don't answer the phone!\n\nI do feel you and your sister are getting screwed. Arguing over dinner is not the answer though. Try anything else. What you did gave them an excuse to ignore the issue with the boys and focus on your behavior instead. You need to keep the focus on the boys if you want results.", "No you're truthful.  And older people have issues with someone telling them they suck at parenting! Especially their own kids!\n\nMy parents raised us gender neutral.  My brother can cook, clean, do laundry and even sew!! My sister and I can mow laws, shingle roofs and I can ARC weld!  We also got basic car care (oil changes, flats, carburetor adjustment and so on.)\nI raised my girls the same way.  We want gender strong women, not helpless Lily's.", "NTA, I told my grandma the same thing earlier this year because she always asks the women in my family to help set up for meals and holiday celebrations (which we're happy to help with of course) but never the men. The realization dawned on her and she immediately began tasks to all the men (which they were also happy to do, I'm blessed to have a lot of wonderful men in my family who were too simple to offer to help) I just told her that since no woman in my generation is going to put up with any man who doesn't contribute his fair share, she's doing my brothers and cousins a disservice by 1) conditioning them to believe contributions are not expected of them and 2) not giving them the opportunity to learn the skills they'll need to contribute equally to a household. She was actually ecstatic and had a lot of fun giving the girls a break at our last holiday meal and having the boys learn everything us girls have been doing for years. She actually thanked me for telling her; people need to retain that kind of flexibility as they age, to change as the world is changing.

To uplift the ones who need it? You can grow out of being lazy and undisciplined, you can\u2019t grow out of loving your family unconditionally. \n\nI love the Army\u2019s way of looking at it, you are only as strong as your weakest soldier. \n\nThat weakness can be mental, physical strength, resiliency, emotional intelligence and integrity \u2014 but overall, how do you become stronger at something that you are weak in? You work at it as much as you can and you correct your mistakes. If you see your brother at the gym lifting with a posture that will hurt his back, do you criticize how no one taught him to stand correctly, or do you go out there and show him through leading by example. \n\nExplaining to your father that your siblings will never find love because they had an uneven amount of chores sounds like some pretty petty judgment \u2014 I would challenge you to replace that resentment with love, forgiveness, and empathy. \n\nResentment will grow like a bacteria, and coming from someone who is still dealing with the remnants of an infection myself, I would say treat that as soon as you can. \n\nJust my 0.02 \ud83e\udee1\ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb", "NTA - good for you for calling out your parents for this sexist parenting!", "NTA - I dont think rational sensible explanations will work here. I would play it by the status of other people's chores. When she calls you out on it just point out no one else has done theirs either and ask why you are being singled out and say stuff like you will do your chores when Broski and Broseph do theirs. Use them as a shield rather than leading by example. One size shoe does not fit all, and you have to find the custom tailored solution that works in your home. But doing your share of the chores and pointing at their unfinished theirs has already failed to yield results. \n\nSo if your brothers are the problem, why not go ahead and compound the problem. You've already seen firsthand that reward for finishing your chores is that you get the privilege of doing your two brothers' share of chores. When your parents call you out on this, dont use your head, just quote excuses your brothers have used. Try to mimic their voices as well if you can, and hopefully, they will see the connection. But at no point do you spell it out for them, use excuses, play dumb and even resort to weaponized incompetence. If you can't solve the problem.
