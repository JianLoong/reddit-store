The truth will out, and this time it came through you. Good job! Sometimes, the truth hurts and is unpopular, especially with the people whose behaviour needs adjustment. Sarcasm: Getting rid of old habits and no longer having a maid on hand is hard /sarcasm off.", "NTA. Go on strike. You'll start doing chores when your brothers do. If they don't enforce your brothers' responsibilities, your parents can do it all.", "NTA\n\nGood for you!!  I don't know if they will listen, but at least you said something. \n\nMy daughter's husband does zero chores around the house, she struggles with this.  His mother has apologized to my daughter over and over for raising all her sons this way.  His mom said that she just always took care of everything and never expected her sons or husband to lift a finger.  She now sees how that was BAD for her daughters-in-law.  \n\nI had three sons; all can cook and clean.  My grandsons are also learning to clean and cook, along with the fishing and sports.  There is no excuse for not teaching your sons domestic tasks.", "NTA, you're 100% right and told them the truth. I already feel bad for your brothers' future partners, being raised with that sort of entitlement to think that it's the woman's job to do everything. Awful on your parents part. They are failing their sons.", "NTA. Truth is very uncomfortable for people like your parents.", "NTA\n\n ... telling you to do your brother's chores **when the FAMILY had agreed that they should be shared is disrespectful** for you and is giving the brothers the message that if they procrastinate they can get out of responsibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>tore the list in half and told my parents that they are creating the sons no one will want to marry in the future and they need to leave behind the mindset of our daughters will do everything  \n\nTrue ...", "NTA. But your mother is probably acting this way because of how she was raised herself, so its not necessarily intentionally. You could have just stood your ground and kept repeating how your brothers are to do them. I can perfectly see how you got mad over it tho and I think its perfectly justified and ok. But as a family you can probably be glad you dont have any serious issues if its just about some group chat about chores and some tiny differences lol", "NTA... this happens way to often.
