They caused a lot of trouble as a teen and have continued to struggle. Also, if I am being frank, Andi had developed some pretty insufferable political opinions and loves to lecture people. Sometimes I want to have dinner, not have Foucault crib noted to me.\n\n*really* rubbed me the wrong way. Trust me, they're gonna get enough shit from their peers over this; they don't need it at home. This is *not* something you want to discourage; Foucault was a great thinker, and what's more, his work challenges *others* to think. It's hard to get a lot of people to engage on that critical level or to *care.* Since Andi's NB, I *definitely* get why Foucault is important to them: he was all about deconstructing social norms, including sexuality and gender (part of the reason for his focus was that he was gay himself). Now, it's true that some people can be insufferable about thinkers like Nietzsche, and when that happens, it's often because they don't understand him very well. You know what I do then? *Engage.* What I would suggest to you is to *read Foucault yourself* and talk about your own thoughts with Andi, ask them what they think about certain points. Seriously, while a lot of postmodern writers do not make clarity their priority, Foucault is pretty straightforward. You should probably start with *History of Sexuality vol. 1.*\n\nI didn't get into academic philosophy until later, but I already cared about a lot of existential shit that my peers didn't relate to, and it was *hard*. I did go around acting like I was smarter than everyone, which didn't help my popularity any, but part of why I did that *was* because of that rejection: it's ego-defense. I was incredibly lucky to have a dad who was always interested in what I had to say and who thought I was just the smartest; that contributed *so much* to my sense of self-esteem and self-confidence. Now, I know how to talk about it in a way that a lot of people find interesting.\n\nEDIT: Oh, they're 23 and not 13? Even so, I get the impression that perhaps they struggle with feeling like a misfit, you know, having been *Queered into society* and all (Judith Butler). It's important to them, and it's probably hard that no one else seems to care. The least you can do is find some good YouTube videos on these thinkers.", "Info: Is Andi 13 or 23?", "YTA!!  A massive one.  Ask yourself how you would feel if you were in Andi's shoes. 13 years old, starting puberty, hormones raging, trying to figure oneself out, then have a stepmom who blatantly shows you that you mean absolutely nothing to them at all. Who shows favouritism to your other siblings.  Just try really, really hard to imagine what it would be like to be Andi. To never have known and actual mother. To know that the woman their father married, actually hates them. \n\nThey probably need therapy and their father should be stepping up and having their back, but their father is failing them too as are you.  You are deliberately traumatizing them and likely making them feel absolutely worthless. They are in a very vulnerable place in their life right now and instead of trying to help them you are compounding the problems. Yes you are definitely a massive YTA and do not deserve to be in anyone of these children's lives.  I feel so very bad for Andi. They need love, compassion and empathy and all you are dishing out is disdain, hate and judgement. They more than anything, need a mothers love and you have made it very clear that you want nothing to do with that or even be a compassionate loving friend.\n\nWhy on earth did you marry a man practically old enough to be your father with kids, when you can't even be a decent human being to one of them? You are far too immature to be in these kids lives!! You are showing Andi that you are the epitome of an evil stepmother.

You can do better. If I read the post correctly, these \u201cchildren\u201d are all now adults in their 20\u2019s and you\u2019ve been in their lives for the past decade, starting when they were teens. Once children grow up and leave home, your relationship with them transitions. You are now friends with all of them, but in varying degrees. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to have a better friend, but not to advertise it so blatantly. If you were unsure what to get Andi, you should have asked them for a short Christmas list of suggestions. Then you pick from the list. You may not be able to come up with a meaningful gift on your own, but you can at least get them something they like and want. And it\u2019s common sense to get gifts in the same general price range when said gifts will be opened in a group setting. And if you were so set on gifting a gift card, it should have been in a comparable price range and to a specific store you know they like.", "YTA. Gee, I wonder why Andi acted out?
