They caused a lot of trouble as a teen and have continued to struggle. Also, if I am being frank, Andi had developed some pretty insufferable political opinions and loves to lecture people. Sometimes I want to have dinner, not have Foucault crib noted to me.\n\n*really* rubbed me the wrong way. Trust me, they're gonna get enough shit from their peers over this; they don't need it at home. This is *not* something you want to discourage; Foucault was a great thinker, and what's more, his work challenges *others* to think. It's hard to get a lot of people to engage on that critical level or to *care.* Since Andi's NB, I *definitely* get why Foucault is important to them: he was all about deconstructing social norms, including sexuality and gender (part of the reason for his focus was that he was gay himself). Now, it's true that some people can be insufferable about thinkers like Nietzsche, and when that happens, it's often because they don't understand him very well. You know what I do then? *Engage.* What I would suggest to you is to *read Foucault yourself* and talk about your own thoughts with Andi, ask them what they think about certain points. Seriously, while a lot of postmodern writers do not make clarity their priority, Foucault is pretty straightforward. You should probably start with *History of Sexuality vol. 1.*\n\nI didn't get into academic philosophy until later, but I already cared about a lot of existential shit that my peers didn't relate to, and it was *hard*. I did go around acting like I was smarter than everyone, which didn't help my popularity any, but part of why I did that *was* because of that rejection: it's ego-defense. I was incredibly lucky to have a dad who was always interested in what I had to say and who thought I was just the smartest; that contributed *so much* to my sense of self-esteem and self-confidence. Now, I know how to talk about it in a way that a lot of people find interesting.\n\nEDIT: Oh, they're 23 and not 13? Even so, I get the impression that perhaps they struggle with feeling like a misfit, you know, having been *Queered into society* and all (Judith Butler). It's important to them, and it's probably hard that no one else seems to care. The least you can do is find some good YouTube videos on these thinkers.", "Info: Is Andi 13 or 23?", "YTA!!  A massive one.  Ask yourself how you would feel if you were in Andi's shoes. 13 years old, starting puberty, hormones raging, trying to figure oneself out, then have a stepmom who blatantly shows you that you mean absolutely nothing to them at all. Who shows favouritism to your other siblings.  Just try really, really hard to imagine what it would be like to be Andi. To never have known and actual mother. To know that the woman their father married, actually hates them. \n\nThey probably need therapy and their father should be stepping up and having their back, but their father is failing them too as are you.  You are deliberately traumatizing them and likely making them feel absolutely worthless. They are in a very vulnerable place in their life right now and instead of trying to help them you are compounding the problems. Yes you are definitely a massive YTA and do not deserve to be in anyone of these children's lives.  I feel so very bad for Andi. They need love, compassion and empathy and all you are dishing out is disdain, hate and judgement. They more than anything, need a mothers love and you have made it very clear that you want nothing to do with that or even be a compassionate loving friend.\n\nWhy on earth did you marry a man practically old enough to be your father with kids, when you can't even be a decent human being to one of them? You are far too immature to be in these kids lives!! You are showing Andi that you are the epitome of an evil stepmother.

You can do better. If I read the post correctly, these \u201cchildren\u201d are all now adults in their 20\u2019s and you\u2019ve been in their lives for the past decade, starting when they were teens. Once children grow up and leave home, your relationship with them transitions. You are now friends with all of them, but in varying degrees. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to have a better friend, but not to advertise it so blatantly. If you were unsure what to get Andi, you should have asked them for a short Christmas list of suggestions. Then you pick from the list. You may not be able to come up with a meaningful gift on your own, but you can at least get them something they like and want. And it\u2019s common sense to get gifts in the same general price range when said gifts will be opened in a group setting.

You bought two kids 100$+ personal gifts and one kid a 20$ gift card when you knew the kids would all see each other's gifts. And you're not a friend of the family, you're their stepmother. You're not obligated to have an equal relationship with every kid, but you are obligated to not show this kind of blatant favoritism in your family.", "You can downplay your role as stepmother all you want but you\u2019re still exactly that to all three of them. Obviously it would be unreasonable to buy them all the same thing but to spend a bunch of money on two of them and then very little on the third is incredibly tacky and rude. Even if they were just people you knew in everyday life, you wouldn\u2019t give gifts of completely different value at the same time like that. Giving Andi $20 was worse than nothing at all because the message you\u2019re sending is \u201cI would have gotten you nothing if I thought I could get away with it.\u201d", "Gaping A H.\n\nYour husband is also a huge A H for putting his new trinket above his children.", "Do you usually line up your friends in order of importance and then make them open their gifts together so they can see where they really stand?\n\nYour user name says you know you're a stepmother. You're should not have married a man with children if you think it's ok to treat two like your best friends and the other one like you have to be around them in order to see the ones you really like.\n\nYou were too immature to be in a relationship with a man with children then, and you're still too immature.", "you don\u2019t buy gifts that reflect your relationships when it comes to 3 siblings that all live under the same roof as you. YTA and you shouldn\u2019t need people to tell you that. you can\u2019t just alienate one kid because you \u201cdon\u2019t feel as close to them.\u201d you have known them for 10 years, you live with them. you\u2019re not their friend, you\u2019re a grown adult who is married to their father. i hope he keeps defending his children, because your treatment of Andi is vile.", "That's not how this situation works and you know it. Show your husband and his kids some respect by not being a blatant ahole. This doesn't mean you have to treat them all exactly the same. Just don't be a dick about it..", "Those are your husband\u2019s children, not random co-workers. You do not gift children in your home based on how much you like them.", "Yes everybody in my immediate family who I love always get 3 gifts. Always the same amount. \n\nThe only person who gets more is my fianc\u00e9.", "OP is only 9 years older than the oldest stepchild. She clearly claimed him as her buddy (since she\u2019s closer in age to him than to her husband) and started treating Andi like her friend\u2019s annoying younger sibling. OP is a mean girl.", ">And the kid lost their mom and dad moved in some woman\n\nPer the OP, Andi lost their mother at birth, and met OP when they were 13. It's extremely disengenuous to suggest, as you're doing, that their mum passed away and their dad immediately \"moved in\" an evil stepmother. \n\nReddit has such a small-town Church lady energy sometimes.", "Ah! That makes so much more sense! I\u2019m reading this late at night and thought the ages were current and was like, \u201cdamn, Andi is only barely a teenager, what\u2019s with your judgment of her?!\u201d but the \u201cteenage behavior\u201d comment makes more sense to me now. OP still sucks, but it\u2019s less about doing this favoritism to people who are actual current children", "Yeah, she definitely spent a good bit more and put actual thought into the other gifts. And based on how she speaks of her stepkids, I'm sure this is FAR from being the only situation that's made it clear to Andi how much she feels about each of them.\n\nThat's absolutely never okay when it involves kids.", "Holy shit! That\u2019s an impressive commitment to his terrible bit!", "But you married a man with children\u2026 so like it or not you have somewhat of a mother role. Not playing favorites is just like bare minimum effort expected here.", "They lost their mom, so of course they are initially going to have the attitude of not wanting youo be their mother figure. Unfortunately your attitude helped solidify tht feeling. Andi, as the youngest would have been ht h hardest at the loss of their mom. Rather appalling that you still have this same attitude, even as time has gone by. You seem a bit selfish and self-centered.  I can see why Andi's behavior towards you has not changed. Your continued behavior is a good reason why.", "Then you shouldn't have married their father and moved in!!", "You married their father voluntarily. That makes you their stepmother.

Giving one a personal gift and another a gift card isn\u2019t the issue, I totally understand that some people are harder to shop for than others. But the budget should still be there same. Like I had an $80 budget for each of my nieces/nephews. Some got gifts and some got gift cards, but all got roughly $80 worth. It\u2019s not the gift card it\u2019s the amount it\u2019s for.", "Honestly I blame the father for marrying someone that said they didn\u2019t want to be a mother figure to his children", "Think OP is 35 years old, she said she was 25 when she married her husband 10 years ago.", "I couldn't care less who dad was fucking or when but my point remains this same. This child had no mother, regardless of memories they an absolutely did lose their mother. And instead of being focused on making sure his kids had a happy and safe homelife he moves in this woman who makes no bones about saying she essentially doesn't want anything to do with those kids. So exactly as i said.... No wonder the kid acted out. If being able to put myself in a kids shoes to imagine how that must have made them feel gives you \"church lady vibes,\" that's your issue, not mine.", "Just a point of clarification: Andi never knew their mother. She died from a blood clot that occurred after Andi was born. Tom is the only one with any memory of their mother. It has undoubtably been hardest on him. I might be an AH, but I do know that.", "I do think you were a bit cheap with your present for Andi - as it should have been in closer value in my opinion.\n\nDid you did spent ~$20-$30 on the gifts all of them?", "Fair enough. Have you ever had a sit down conversation with Andi to find if there is some common ground? The giftcard is obviously a bridge too far for your husband and the clear favoritism is going to widen a gap between you and your husband if you continue down this path. I would make a genuine attempt to engage Andi and see if this cycle can be broken.", "That makes it even worse. Imagine being a 3 year old who is rejected over and over and over again by the only mother figure they know. No wonder they acted up. Not to mention coming to terms with their gender identity.", "\"Might be an AH?\" Come on we're way past might. You are a HUGE AH..", "Cuisinarts are hundreds a piece. So definitely not.", "Except OP didn\u2019t come around until Andi was 13 and they are now 23.
