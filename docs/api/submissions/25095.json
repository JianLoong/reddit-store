{"id": 25095, "submission_id": "15wdcgq", "title": "AITA for asking my sister and daughter to stay out of my love life?", "selftext": "I'm a 39 year old male and have an 11 year old daughter. My wife passed away in an accident when our daughter was 2 years old. I've done all I can to keep her memory alive, especially for my daughter as she doesn't really have any memories of her since she was so young.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think I've completely gotten over losing her. It doesn't dominate my mind space as it used to and I can lead a fairly normal life, but I don't want to date anyone because I'm not ready or interested and it's not fair to date someone else if I'm not completely over my wife.\n\nMy sister is 3 years younger than me and has insisted I start dating since 1 year after my wife died. She's tried to introduce me to a few women over the years too, which I didn't really appreciate but she kept doing. She says she is looking out for me which I understand but I wish she would respect my wishes. Last year she started putting thoughts into my daughter's head too which really upset me. She would tell her things like \"Don't you want a mommy?\" \"You're going to need a mom soon (hinting at puberty)\" . She is also happily married with 2 children who my daughter adores. My daughter started coming home over the past 6 months from visiting their home and asked why we can't have a 'normal' family like my sister does. My heart pretty much broke at that point and I started to question if I was being selfish.\n\nThey were both over yesterdaywhen my daughter again brought the topic up.  I firmly told her \"I'm not interested and I don't want to\" which I agree was harshly spoken. She burst into tears and hasn't spoken to me since. My sister then turned on me and called me a selfish AH for putting my needs above my daughter's.  I told her to please leave me alone and she took that badly too. She insisted on staying to 'console' my daughter.\n\nI am going to apologize to my daughter today for being harsh with her but I also want to reiterate that I'm not interested in dating anyone. Am I being an asshole for this?\n\nEDIT to add: I would have no issues cutting my sister out of my life or limiting interactions till she dropped this, but like I mentioned my daughter adores her cousins and cutting my sister out would also mean cutting off that interaction.", "created_utc": 1692542893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wdcgq/aita_for_asking_my_sister_and_daughter_to_stay/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The last thing she needs to internalize is the idea that you must engage in relationships for the benefit of others, even if you don't want to.", "NTA. May not have been your best moment but your sister is a giant AH. Your life and your experiences aren\u2019t hers. If you don\u2019t want a relationship, that\u2019s your choice. If your daughter wants to ask questions and understand your mindset better, that makes sense especially at her age. But your sister pushing/insisting is toxic, rude and disrespectful.", "NTA. Make it clear that your sister's comments won't be tolerated by ending the visit immediately when she starts making these comments.", "NTA - Your sister think it\u2019s selfish to you daughter not to date? Wow!\n\nNot to be rude but you wouldn\u2019t make a good partner if you\u2019re not over your wife before you start dating.\n\nImagine the poor women who would date you thinking you\u2019re emotionally stable when you\u2019re not. Your sister doesn\u2019t care about those women, obviously. She\u2019s the selfish one!\n\nI\u2019m sure your sister insistance comes from a good place but she needs to back off.\nAsk her, if she died tomorrow and a year after her death you\u2019re telling your brother in law to forget all about her and replace her, and keep pushing, and pushing and pushing about it. How would she feel?\n\nYour child has all those questions now because of your sister. Her actions are making your daughter doubt and be unhappy.\n\nHappy dad, happy kid. Same the other way around.\n\nWhat does your daughter like to do? How about having some special \u2018date nights\u2019, treating her like a princess and making memories. Also, do something fun with her. Any extra cash for a fun few days away?\n\nTime to bring more fun in the house. The rest will take care of itself, with time\u2026", "NTA. Why should you date someone when you aren\u2019t ready? That isn\u2019t fair to you or the dating partner who deserves your full commitment. Your sister needs to stay out of your live life at this point. You also might want to reduce the time sis spends with daughter if you can\u2019t be there to stop these guilt trip discussions.", "NTA\n\nIt's Ok to set boundaries and it's OK to ask to be respected.  It doesn't mean people will respect you, that just is, but your reasons for not dating are valid.\n\nI think it is very disrespectful for your sister to cross your boundaries after you said no and gave good reasons.  Your reasons are quite valid and also mature, because you recognize that you are not ready and that's OK.\n\nIt's not OK for your sister to cross your boundaries and then manipulate your daughter to think your situation is not normal.  Your situation is normal and it is not your Sister's place to decide for you.  That's not OK.  \n\nApologize to your daughter, that is important, and let her know that you aren't ready and that's OK.  \n\nFamily dynamics are very different as a whole and that's OK.  \n\nBoundary violations need consequence and that can look like, no contact.  If she cannot respect your boundaries, especially with your daughter, then separating yourself from the situation now and reevaluating later is also valid.  \n\nYour feelings are valid and you deserve to be respected.  You recognize your reaction and apologized.  Now it is time to enforce your boundaries in a conductive way, in order to maintain your own peace and mental health.", "NTA.  Your dating timetable is your own and no one should try to push that forward.  It\u2019s wrong for you, and would be wrong for anyone you\u2019d potentially meet if you weren\u2019t really open to a relationship.    I also think your sister may be prodding your daughter along in this.  She has to stop.", "NTA - your sister is grossly overstepping and she is the cause of all of your daughter\u2019s distress.", "NTA. \n\nWhoever you date at this point you will always compare to your late wife and GF will come up short. You know this, and that's hurting an innocent person in the name of placating your sister. That will never be ok.\n\nI think it's time that your daughter gets into therapy, either alone or with you as a family. She's got her own feelings about how her family is structured, and those are legitimate. Asking you to do something that's not healthy for you in order to fulfill her wants isn't appropriate, but she's 11 and getting fed some pretty mixed messages from your sister. Time to get a neutral third party to help her process these complicated feelings.\n\nAs for your sister. Look. Your daughter is going to be looking for a strong female presence in her life to learn from. Right now that's defaulted to your sister. And your sister is telling your daughter that you don't care enough about her to give her a mother. And then weaponizing your daughter against you. There is nothing healthy about that dynamic. *At all.* Your sister is traumatizing your daughter and you. She *has* to be cut off for the time being until your daughter has made some progress in therapy and processing why her life and her family doesn't look like everyone else's.\n\nSpend more time with your daughter. Arrange for her to spend more time with grandmothers and other aunts. If she's got a close friend at school, reach out to that child's parents and see if they'd be open to spending more time with her, either her at their house or you both going out to activities as whole families. Find more positive female role models who can help guide your daughter into adulthood without destroying her relationship with you at the same time.", "NTA. You can't force dating on someone. Instead of scaring your daughter into thinking her life will be horrible without a mom, she could be helping to build her up to overcome the challenges life will inevitably present. Instead your sister chose to damage your daughter in an attempt to manipulate you. Your sister is cruel, not helpful.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister for pushing the subject and getting your kid involved.\n\nYou for letting your sister manipulate your 11 year old kid and taking your frustration out on her when she's doing what she's doing because of your sister and your lack of boundaries.\n\nYour daugther adores her cousins ? Great. How would she like not being used and mentally and emotionnally abused by her aunt ?", "NTA. It's your life. If you're not ready, you're not ready. Your sister putting ideas into your daughters head to get you to start dating is pretty shitty too. What if you do start dating again and your daughter doesn't like the woman even if you think she's perfect for you? Losing a SO is heartbreaking. Good on you for raising your daughter and keeping her mom's memory alive.", "Nta but your sister is", "NTA - your sister is wildly out of line. You need to get super firm/borderline mean with her. \"You will not speak to me or my daughter about whether or not I am or should be dating, unless it is to back me up. Every time you do, you are causing significant, possibly irreparable damage to our relationship. I am not interested in dating. It does not harm my daughter that I am a single dad. And I will NOT explain myself again. More over, you will talk to my daughter about how you were wrong and how it is not okay to pressure someone into doing something they do not want to do. If you can't agree to these things, you will be the one harming my daughter, because she will miss you and your daughters when I signicantly limit contact.\"", "NTA. You aren't ready, and you may never be. You are doing the right thing by not dating. You are sparing some potentially lovely person the heartache, but also your daughter. Imagine your daughter becomes attached to a potential mother figure, and you end up walking away when you realize you're still in love with your wife. Or, maybe this woman figures out she comes second or third in your life and starts to resent your daughter. How many evil step-parent stories do we read on aita?\nSister needs to back the f off you and your love life. Your mental health and that of your daughter is the primary focus for now.", "ESH. You've seen your sister's behaviour for years but you never had a conversation with your daughter about it until you blew up? How hard was it to nip it in the bud and do your job as a parent?", "ESH -But your sister the most for pushing this and getting your kid involved with press hanging you into dating.\n\nBut she's 11 years old.

She has brainwashed your daughter into thinking that only a family with both parents is \u201cnormal\u201d or happy. Maybe family therapy with her can also help.

She needs.to understand that just bc her intentions are good, doesnt mean that there aren't very serious and innapropriate consequences to her behavior.
