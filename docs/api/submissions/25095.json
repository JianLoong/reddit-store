My wife passed away in an accident when our daughter was 2 years old. I've done all I can to keep her memory alive, especially for my daughter as she doesn't really have any memories of her since she was so young.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think I've completely gotten over losing her. It doesn't dominate my mind space as it used to and I can lead a fairly normal life, but I don't want to date anyone because I'm not ready or interested and it's not fair to date someone else if I'm not completely over my wife.\n\nMy sister is 3 years younger than me and has insisted I start dating since 1 year after my wife died. She's tried to introduce me to a few women over the years too, which I didn't really appreciate but she kept doing. She says she is looking out for me which I understand but I wish she would respect my wishes. Last year she started putting thoughts into my daughter's head too which really upset me. She would tell her things like \"Don't you want a mommy?\" \"You're going to need a mom soon (hinting at puberty)\" . She is also happily married with 2 children who my daughter adores. My daughter started coming home over the past 6 months from visiting their home and asked why we can't have a 'normal' family like my sister does. My heart pretty much broke at that point and I started to question if I was being selfish.\n\nThey were both over yesterdaywhen my daughter again brought the topic up.  I firmly told her \"I'm not interested and I don't want to\" which I agree was harshly spoken. She burst into tears and hasn't spoken to me since. My sister then turned on me and called me a selfish AH for putting my needs above my daughter's.  I told her to please leave me alone and she took that badly too. She insisted on staying to 'console' my daughter.\n\nI am going to apologize to my daughter today for being harsh with her but I also want to reiterate that I'm not interested in dating anyone. Am I being an asshole for this?\n\nEDIT to add: I would have no issues cutting my sister out of my life or limiting interactions till she dropped this, but like I mentioned my daughter adores her cousins and cutting my sister out would also mean cutting off that interaction.", "created_utc": 1692542893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wdcgq/aita_for_asking_my_sister_and_daughter_to_stay/", "score": 658, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know what he did do for me. He gave me access to any female friend of his and I became good friends with a few. They were all strong independent women (one was married but still held on to her independence) who were happy to talk to me about anything I needed and would take me bra shopping regularly as I grew. One even helped me through my first pregnancy, a miscarriage and post-partum (my dad recognised the signs that something wasn't right and \"called in reinforcements\" in the form of the two women I called mum both had also suffered PPA & PPD, and the three of them made a plan to get me the help i needed).\n\nYou do not need to date again, until YOU are ready, but if possible I would speak to a few female friends who can help you and your daughter when you both need it, even better if it is someone who was good friends with your late wife as they can help keep your wife's memories alive. (Given your sisters behaviour though I would be cautious about enlisting her help with this plan since she has already made it clear her on what her thoughts are and I wouldn't want her around my children).
