Within a family, there has to be a balance between sharing and personal possessions. It is pretty common for parents to buy something for a first child that they expect to be used by subsequent children after the eldest grows out of it. Even if that thing is given as a gift on a gift-giving occasion, I don't think that is necessarily a wrong expectation. I don't think forcing you to share your toys every single time a sibling wants to use them is right. It's still yours until you're done with it. Still, generally teaching sharing among siblings is usually a good thing. I've seen a younger sibling complain here about everything they ever get is a hand-me-down and being resentful that the older sibling always gets new stuff, even though of course the older sibling will need something new because they have outgrown all of the kid stuff in the home. They used that to paint a picture of being the neglected child.

Limit what your family can see on social media.  While you want to have a wonderful life, don't antagonize them to the point that they try to make you miserable or sabotage your changes.  If they can't see / post on your pages, they can't spread rumors or try to stir things up for you.  Be proactive and limit their opportunities.\n2. Change banks.  Make certain that your folks have NO access to any account you may have.  Put flags on your credit rating and school records saying that your family cannot access them or open accounts under your name.\n3. Take important documents with you - Driver's License (obviously), but also birth certificate, passport - anything that's difficult to replace or which might facilitate identity theft.\n4. Assuming you are over 18, execute a Durable Power of Attorney and Healthcare Power of Attorney naming your uncle or someone you trust to make decisions and act on your behalf if you are unable to do so.  If you don't have this and are in an accident, etc., the court will appoint someone - usually your next of kin, which in this case would be your parents - to make decisions for you.    Make it where they can't have any more influence over you than you want.

All I see is someone complaining that they were always given the best things in the family, but made to share it sometimes.\n\nThat being said, once the gift is given to you, and is legally yours, then you can sell it.

This can be a simple thanks or a thank you note. \n\nOwnership of the item transfers ENTIRELY to the giftee at this point. It is RUDE for the gifter to inquire about or consider the item IN ANY WAY after this point. Some people ask for pictures: RUDE. Some people ask to borrow it back: RUDE.

Some people note that they spent X and then expect you to also spend X, nope! \n\nSome people say \"use it as long as you need, but then I want it back\u2014that's not a gift, that's a loan, and needs to be stated as such. \n\nBasically, a gift disappears from the gifter's life permanently. If the giftee CHOOSES to share, UNPROMPTED, great! But asking, acknowledging, talking about, etc. is RRRUUUUUDE. \n\nThe one question I have here was, was the Switch actually given to JUST you? Was that the intention? Sometimes a gift for the family is opened by one person, or \"owned\" by one person, but really meant to benefit everyone. \"You can keep it in your room but have to share\" when it is opened. It's a conditional gift, but the conditions are stated. \n\nI don't think you were in the wrong, or the asshole, but I think as you grow older, you'll see this was kind of a graceless outlook.

I was really excited to give it to her and see her face when she opened it.   To show her that I listened to her needs when she thought I didn't (I always tried but had undiagnosed ADHD which made everything harder).\n\nShe was completely befuddled when she opened it.   She never once said she wanted one.   She wanted a sewing machine so she could learn to sew.   I don't know how I got those two things confused. \n\nAnd I have used the Cuisinart far more in our relationship than she has.\n\nI was so sure she wanted it, but I guess it was me who wanted it all along.", "For Easter the kids would all put their candy they found on display and trade and candy with the other kids and sell it to the adults. \n\nThey would set up their areas and the bargaining and things like this candy costs 2 lollipops, but you can get this one for only 1 lollipop....", "How do you have do much comment karma already?  \n>Your plan was brilliant and I admire your thinking.\n\nThe person you replied to didn't talk about any plan.  So, what are you talking about?", "I think first of all it should be something they do voluntarily, a lot of parents just take a piece as though they're collecting a tax. Taking something from a kid does not teach them how to share, it teaches them that their possessions aren't theirs.\n\nI also feel like A LOT of parents expect their kids to share with them without ever sharing with their kids in an explicit way.\n\nObviously as a parent you're sharing your income and your house with them, but that's not really visible from a kid's POV. What you run the risk of is your kid noticing that they have to share their iPad with their sister but you get your own laptop that they're not allowed to touch.  Or how mommy's drinks are \"special grown up drinks\" but mommy's allowed to take one of your apple juices whenever she wants.\n\nAgain not to say that most parents don't end up ceding their possessions/time/money/energy to kids but to the kid it's rarely framed as voluntary sharing per se. Whereas what we expect kids to do is make the active choice to share because it will enhance enjoyment and build relationships. I think sharing with them as you would with an adult human, not to be polite but because you want someone else to share in whatever cool thing you're experiencing, has a lot of value.", "He probably won't. Do you know how many of us have a candy/chocolate stash because others don't think we deserve it and deprive us? \n\nFuckin' A, dude! I don't eat chocolate \"fast enough\", so that means it's forfeit, according to my husband. I've got a package of M&M's I forgot I even had. Still mine!\n\n*Never* try to tell women in this sub they need to share chocolate. Not happening!", "Our local health board in my area of Canada actually says to let kids choose how much holiday chocolate they wanna eat, and if they eat too much, talk to them about how they feel - usually awful and stomach-achey - and let them know they can freely and at all times choose how much to eat, but to keep in mind that sometimes it can be too much for us to handle and that's part of learning. Learning via freedom of experience is much better than learning via being told not to\n\n(Meanwhile, I just would get told I'd get a stomach ache and never allowed to eat more than maybe a few at one time by my overbearing mother. Then I'd get called fat for eating it and forced to work out because I was overweight, despite never having been thin ever. My doctors signed off on this behaviour and blamed me. Times sure have changed.)", "> My reasoning is I really just don't want him eating all that chocolate at once.\n\nRation it. For something like Easter, let him see his haul and then tell him he can have x amount per day. Then the two of you can look in whatever receptacle you choose for the candy each day and he can pick what he wants.", "Learning to ration one's chocolate is one thing.

I wasn\u2019t allowed in his room if he wasn\u2019t there, I wasn\u2019t allowed to use them if he wanted to use them, and if he didn\u2019t want me in his room I couldn\u2019t go in there to play.\n\nSo really I never got to use literally any of my \u201cgifts\u201d from like 8 until I graduated. Even then I wasn\u2019t allowed to take anything when I moved out (he\u2019s 2 years older but ended up living at home 4 years longer than me, I moved out the day after hs graduation) so I had to use my graduation money to buy a laptop to do school work because I wasn\u2019t even allowed to take the computer, even though they had a family computer in the living room.\n\nOP is def NTA, parents making siblings share this kind of stuff but claiming that it\u2019s for one sibling as their gift suck.", "I just figured OP was the eldest and first-born.", "Yeah, I was the oldest and was once persuaded by my mum to pool my birthday money with my sister so we could buy a Gameboy to share.

But I know many friends who have a very hard time not expressing but allowing themselves to feel the thing they were told not to feel. \n\nI wonder what it is that digs into some people and yet the same words and actions don't with others. Our brains and ways we react are so fascinating.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not saying my way was better or worse or that the other people could have felt differently. We were kids with few tools, we reacted how we reacted.

I\u2019m sure if I had been forced to share my food as a kid I would absolutely hate sharing now, and rightfully so if I had been forced to share and never have anything to myself as a child.

If it was in the living room where sharing/turn taking was the polite thing to do between siblings (though to make it fair on our brother me and my sister treated it as a combined turn - 1 \"girl\" show/film followed by his choice, back to us). \n\nBut yeah reading this OP is near certainly the eldest/stepkid/only female or male sibling (as much as people are crying misogyny I know a hell of a lot of boys who were the only son in a house of daughters who got treated that way)", "Do you think as OP grew up, they never asked/whined, \"Why do I have to share my things, but siblings never do?\"\n\nIf so....have you ever even SEEN a child?", "It\u2019s $300 for a switch and frankly I\u2019ve never seen a bike any cheaper than that for a teenage boy.
