Back then it was part of a ranch surrounded by other ranches. The owner needed money so he parceled out this section and sold it to me. I built a small house on it and have lived in it ever since. Since it was originally part of a ranch, I did enough to legally keep it classified as a ranch so the property tax is extremely low. \n\nOver the years, companies started to move to the neighboring big city and land prices started to go up. Almost all of the ranchers sold their lands to developers so now there are huge houses surrounding mine. They start from $500,000 and go to several million. None of them sit on even an acre of land. My house is clearly the worst house around and I have no doubt it\u2019s bringing the value of nearby houses down. \n\nThat\u2019s all happened before I met and dated my fianc\u00e9e. Now that we\u2019re engaged, we\u2019re talking seriously about our finances and the only sticking point is the house. She wants her name on the deed once we\u2019re married because we\u2019ll be sharing our lives. Alternatively, she wants me to sell the house and we purchase a house together. I don\u2019t find either options attractive.\n\nIn our state, whatever we bring to the marriage we take out. Since I will be bringing the house into the marriage, I can leave with it should things not work out. If I put her name on it, then she\u2019ll get half. If I sell the house, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to afford anything that\u2019s even close to what I have now. Not to mention our property tax will be several times higher. Then there\u2019s the drive time. My house is 30 minutes away from my work and 40 from hers. House prices has gone up so much that we\u2019ll have to move at least an hour away from our jobs. \n\nLike I said, we agreed with or compromised on everything else. This one issue is the only sticking point and it\u2019s becoming a big one. So much so that she brought her family into it. This weekend her father took me out to dinner to have a man to man talk. He told me that if we\u2019re going to join our lives, we have to join everything. He expects me to do the right thing if I want to join their family. So now it\u2019s her entire family on one side and me by myself on the other. Am I wrong to want to keep the house I built by myself to myself?\n\nEdit 1 to answer a good question:\n\nNeither of us are rich. I bought the land at a very low price but now it\u2019s worth 10 times as much. Even if I offer to sell half of it to her at its current value, there\u2019s no way she can afford it. That\u2019s why if we buy a house together, we\u2019ll have to move far from here and our jobs in order to get one we can both afford.\n\nEdit 2 to answer some common questions:\n\nIn all, I spent about $200,000 to buy the land and build the house. Everything is paid off and I pay the extremely low taxes every year. The tax assessment on my property is about $2 million. I don\u2019t know anything about refinancing but at our salary level, I highly doubt we would qualify. In fact, we\u2019ve spoken to a real estate agent and with a 20% down, our salary qualifies us for a $300,000 house. The property tax on a $300,000 house is many times the currently tax I pay now. I\u2019m comfortable with us living in my house and paying all the taxes and maintenance by myself.", "created_utc": 1695147316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16my6iw/aita_for_not_putting_my_wifes_name_on_the_house/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of working it out with you, she goes to her mommy and daddy and sends flying monkeys to deal with it. \n\nThis is how every issue is going to be dealt with. Every disagreement is going to be her whole family against you ever time.  \nI don't think any of them have either your best interests or even your well-being at heart and I have no doubt that if the roles were reversed, you'd be having dinner with her father explaining how you need to do the right thing and not expect half.\n\nNot saying break up with her, just pointing out serious red flags. \n\nThe fact is, if she isn't planning on breaking up, she wouldn't need to demand half.

By bringing her family into it and having her father personally \u201cdiscuss\u201d the issue with you, she showed that she doesn\u2019t regard you as an equal partner, AND that she believes in bullying you into getting you to agree with her. The only acceptable solution here would be to consult a financial advisor for options and to discuss this between you two to find a solution. \n\nHer discussing this with her family is a mistake; her father discussing this directly with you is a deal-breaker type of mistake. Neither she, nor he, seem to understand how much of a massive overstep that was. Would you think it okay that your in-laws weigh in on your child-bearing decisions? \n\nOne thought with regard to a solution is to have a legal document drawn up that requires you to pay her 1/2 of the net value from month of marriage to month of transfer. She deserves something for living there as her home for 20 years if that\u2019s what happens. Since she didn\u2019t invest the money in the first place, I see your point of the current value solely being yours and not hers, but from the point of marriage on, she will be investing in the property. That makes it collectively both of yours. Have an appraisal done and you should be good to go. \n\nBear in mind, I think you have a larger issue than just this property ownership.", "Nta.

Tap the brakes on getting closer to a wedding until you figure this whether this is a dealbreaker for either of you.\n\nHer father should stay out of it for sure.

Don't let her family bully you. You don't have to put her name on the deed. It makes no financial sense just to hand her half of your property.", "NTA, it's your property and you don't have to sell it for her or her family.  Ask her why she chose to bring her family into something that doesn't concern them or her.

I don't remember what it was now but say he had 60% and I had 40% that's what we would get back.  We didn't think we'd be splitting up and clearly haven't 22 years later. Perhaps you could do something along those lines for after you're married and she starts contributing to the upkeep of the property, because that's also the main point she needs to contribute too. Or get it valued and say sure, pay me half and then I'll put you on the deed.\n\nThough I think you really need to have a sit down with her and explain how getting her family involved is unacceptable, if she doesn't think it is you really need to reconsider your relationship, because you definitely don't want them wading in on all your arguments.", "If I have to pay for it, I want to legally own it too. Sometimes in a couple one partner makes the purchase because they have better credit and so a lower interest rate on the loan is a pocketed benefit to both. \n\nBut, I can't blame anyone for expecting they be a legal owner of a house they also have to pay for.\n\nNAH.

Draft an agreement that whatever money she puts into the house, she should receive back if there is ever a divorce.\nYou need to see the signs of her bringing in her family to bully/guilt you as something that will happen in the future if she doesn't get her way.\n This is a hill I would personally die on. She disrespected you the moment she brought her family into it. She is acting entitled to your property/money and you aren't even married yet.

That way both parties who should be contributing to the house, the value, the costs- will get something in return. If after you bringing this up and she should refuse, I\u2019d truly reconsider this marriage. It\u2019s not feasible to dig your heels in over something that isn\u2019t yours.

I honestly don't think mixing financials is a great idea in the first place, but that's me. If she's willing to buy in (pay half of what you actually put in for it) then that would be more fair, but it's still your decision. NTA and good luck.", "Nta\nSounds like your fiance turned into a gold digger once she realized how much money is in it for her and her family.\nI agree with her fathers words, not his sentiment, though. Man up and do the right thing. Call off the wedding. Protect yourself.", "You're not the asshole and if I'm completely honest and if I were you, I would definitely be re thinking about the marriage.

But if the home/land is paid off, then she is not entitled to your property at this time.  \n\nExplain to her dad that family goes both ways.  Ask him when he plans to put you on his house deed.  The more this goes on and the more she brings her family into it raises more red flags to me.  It appears they all are looking at you like a cash cow.  I'd step very carefully from here.  It may be a good time to step back from the relationship, and postpone any wedding plans until she either comes to her senses or you two split up.  It just feels like there's a lot more going on in the background than what you are seeing from her.  Maybe her family is pressuring her so they can get their hands on some money if you two sell.  Maybe she's a gold digger.  Maybe it's nothing.  Take your time and find out.  \n\nIt also would not hurt to consult a lawyer and get some advice from him before proceeding.  Maybe set up a timeframe where she gets put on the deed after 10 years of marriage or something, or after you two have children.  But in my mind it's a bit early for her to demand half your property, especially with how valuable the house/land has become.  And dragging her family in to help pressure you is a big red flag.", "NTA but I see your wife's point.

It\u2019s your house and therefore it\u2019s only fair that you get to keep it if you were ever to split up.

If you are not, you are protected. These are pre-marital assets. Protect them.", "NAH. I understand the concerns from both sides. I would suggest that you continue to pay all property taxes and maintenance, and the two of you split utilities. Your wife will have a free place to live, so she can set aside money each month that she would otherwise be using to pay rent or a mortgage, and build a nice nest egg for herself in the case that you ever divorce, so that she will be able to find herself housing.

No reason to put her on the deed unless he wants to lose 1/2 his home.\n\nAs for a large remodel, that will make things murky, as she\u2019ll have a claim on 1/2 the upgrades that are performed.\n\nAs for \u201cneighborhood standards\u201d, those standards would be newer, bigger homes than his.  So unless he plans to demolish the house and build a newer one, it won\u2019t ever be like the others.", "Yes, this!  I'd do a cash out refi (keeping the equity for myself) and put her on the new mortgage and deed. Then all is fair and you're basically starting over on equal footing as far as the house is concerned.

Use it to start over or to buy her out and make it your house again.\n\nIf she doesn't want to do this, maybe y'all should just keep dating rather than getting married.", "Law is pretty clear, if the house is paid for prior to the marriage it\u2019s considered separate property and remains his.\n\nShe only gets a claim if it\u2019s not completely paid for and then only on half the equity gained.\n\nAnd yes, dad should butt out.", "Is this true, though? I know it depends on location, but I\u2019ve always heard horror stories of people losing their spouses and it being a nightmare to keep extended family out of the \u201cmarital\u201d home/property/protecting personal belongings.\n\nWouldn\u2019t having your name on the property make that process more fluid?

I fully get that it\u2019s a premarital asset and he is the one who bought it, and I don\u2019t think she should have had her dad get involved, BUT she suggested two choices of either getting added to the deed or selling it and buying something together. People are saying she won\u2019t compromise but OP isn\u2019t compromising either. If her name is put on the deed and they divorce then it\u2019s split between them and OP still makes a profit because of how much the value has gone up. If they sell and get a new house they split that as well. But if her name is no where near any deed and they get divorced, she very well might be completely screwed. They\u2019re both trying to be pragmatic in their own interest", "I don't disagree with you at all.  And I agree that I suspect she also doesn't plan on putting anything down, but I'm just assuming.", "Pre-martial assets tend to stay with whoever brought them into the marriage, generally speaking.", "Kind of.

Or are those specific details what we would expect a will to cover? \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is the asshole, so this isn\u2019t an attempt at a gotcha, just one of those things I\u2019ve always wondered about.
