{"id": 27202, "submission_id": "16my6iw", "title": "AITA for not putting my wife\u2019s name on the house deed?", "selftext": "She\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e right now but the argument we\u2019re having is that once we\u2019re married, she wants her name on the house deed.\n\nYears ago, I bought several acres as soon as I could afford it. Back then it was part of a ranch surrounded by other ranches. The owner needed money so he parceled out this section and sold it to me. I built a small house on it and have lived in it ever since. Since it was originally part of a ranch, I did enough to legally keep it classified as a ranch so the property tax is extremely low. \n\nOver the years, companies started to move to the neighboring big city and land prices started to go up. Almost all of the ranchers sold their lands to developers so now there are huge houses surrounding mine. They start from $500,000 and go to several million. None of them sit on even an acre of land. My house is clearly the worst house around and I have no doubt it\u2019s bringing the value of nearby houses down. \n\nThat\u2019s all happened before I met and dated my fianc\u00e9e. Now that we\u2019re engaged, we\u2019re talking seriously about our finances and the only sticking point is the house. She wants her name on the deed once we\u2019re married because we\u2019ll be sharing our lives. Alternatively, she wants me to sell the house and we purchase a house together. I don\u2019t find either options attractive.\n\nIn our state, whatever we bring to the marriage we take out. Since I will be bringing the house into the marriage, I can leave with it should things not work out. If I put her name on it, then she\u2019ll get half. If I sell the house, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to afford anything that\u2019s even close to what I have now. Not to mention our property tax will be several times higher. Then there\u2019s the drive time. My house is 30 minutes away from my work and 40 from hers. House prices has gone up so much that we\u2019ll have to move at least an hour away from our jobs. \n\nLike I said, we agreed with or compromised on everything else. This one issue is the only sticking point and it\u2019s becoming a big one. So much so that she brought her family into it. This weekend her father took me out to dinner to have a man to man talk. He told me that if we\u2019re going to join our lives, we have to join everything. He expects me to do the right thing if I want to join their family. So now it\u2019s her entire family on one side and me by myself on the other. Am I wrong to want to keep the house I built by myself to myself?\n\nEdit 1 to answer a good question:\n\nNeither of us are rich. I bought the land at a very low price but now it\u2019s worth 10 times as much. Even if I offer to sell half of it to her at its current value, there\u2019s no way she can afford it. That\u2019s why if we buy a house together, we\u2019ll have to move far from here and our jobs in order to get one we can both afford.\n\nEdit 2 to answer some common questions:\n\nIn all, I spent about $200,000 to buy the land and build the house. Everything is paid off and I pay the extremely low taxes every year. The tax assessment on my property is about $2 million. I don\u2019t know anything about refinancing but at our salary level, I highly doubt we would qualify. In fact, we\u2019ve spoken to a real estate agent and with a 20% down, our salary qualifies us for a $300,000 house. The property tax on a $300,000 house is many times the currently tax I pay now. I\u2019m comfortable with us living in my house and paying all the taxes and maintenance by myself.\n\nEdit 3 to answer a common question:\n\nMany are asking about my compromise and pointing out her lack of financial security. My compromise is that we live in my house and I will pay all of the taxes, bills, and maintenance costs. Based on our conversation with the real estate agent, if we buy a $300,000 house, her half of the mortgage would be about $1,300 not including her half of the property tax and down payment. I pointed out to her that if I pay for everything toward my current house, she would be saving at least $15,600 a year over 30 years on the mortgage alone. That doesn\u2019t include the money she would be saving not paying the down payment and property tax. In my mind, that would give her plenty of financial freedom and security.\n\nAlso, if I sell the land, I don\u2019t want to buy any new house outright with that money. The reason we went to see a real estate agent is that if we buy a house together, I want it to be something we can both afford (mortgage, down payment, taxes divided equally). I would put any money I make off the sale into my retirement account. That\u2019s the main reason why I haven\u2019t sold my land despite many developers begging me to (yes, some actually begged). I view it as my retirement investment.", "created_utc": 1695147316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16my6iw/aita_for_not_putting_my_wifes_name_on_the_house/", "score": 5053, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of working it out with you, she goes to her mommy and daddy and sends flying monkeys to deal with it. \n\nThis is how every issue is going to be dealt with. Every disagreement is going to be her whole family against you ever time.  \nI don't think any of them have either your best interests or even your well-being at heart and I have no doubt that if the roles were reversed, you'd be having dinner with her father explaining how you need to do the right thing and not expect half.\n\nNot saying break up with her, just pointing out serious red flags. \n\nThe fact is, if she isn't planning on breaking up, she wouldn't need to demand half.

By bringing her family into it and having her father personally \u201cdiscuss\u201d the issue with you, she showed that she doesn\u2019t regard you as an equal partner, AND that she believes in bullying you into getting you to agree with her. The only acceptable solution here would be to consult a financial advisor for options and to discuss this between you two to find a solution. \n\nHer discussing this with her family is a mistake; her father discussing this directly with you is a deal-breaker type of mistake. Neither she, nor he, seem to understand how much of a massive overstep that was. Would you think it okay that your in-laws weigh in on your child-bearing decisions? \n\nOne thought with regard to a solution is to have a legal document drawn up that requires you to pay her 1/2 of the net value from month of marriage to month of transfer. She deserves something for living there as her home for 20 years if that\u2019s what happens. Since she didn\u2019t invest the money in the first place, I see your point of the current value solely being yours and not hers, but from the point of marriage on, she will be investing in the property. That makes it collectively both of yours. Have an appraisal done and you should be good to go. \n\nBear in mind, I think you have a larger issue than just this property ownership.\n\nEdited to add: NTA\n\nEdit #2: Thank you for all the upvotes!

There\u2019s a lot of emotional investment in this for her, and of course the way property values continue to rise, her not buying a house now we\u2019ll make it more difficult for her to buy one later.

That's a legitimate concern and I do think it makes sense that after building a life together in that house, she gets to continue living there if you pass away, I assume you would want that. That's something you could compromise on, and write up a will that, if you die while still married, she keeps the house.\n-You have to make clear that ALL repair/maintenance/renovation costs, property tax, is entirely your responsibility as the sole owner of the house. It wouldn't be fair that she contributes to keeping/increasing the value of the house if she gets nothing.\n-This would be so weird in a marriage, but also maybe a rental contract? To make sure that, if you separate/fight, you cannot just kick her out immediately.\n-Not something really practical/realistic to solve, but it is a fact that, since you will be the sole owner of the house, it will never feel for her just as much as her home, and she will not have the same say as to what happens with it. It's not the same moving into someone else's house as building your place together where you both have the same decision power on decoration, what renovations to do, when to paint, the choice on the house itself, etc. This is not something you can really solve, but at least try to make her feel that she will be included in these decisions, that it will be her home too.\nIf she shuts down all discussion about the above..sorry, she's just there for the potential money.", ">Like I said, we agreed with or compromised on everything else.\n\nNo you haven't.

A statement like this makes it feel like you have one foot out the door already. It's like you count on getting divorced. And that's kind of screwed up that you only care about yourself enough in that situation. Why bother getting married if you're already planning on the worst case scenario. I know the saying is expect the worst and hope for the best. But this is marriage.

If, as you say, you walk out, she's left without a home. She's left having to gather her belongings and figure out a whole new situation. She's going to  be SOL.

Things like renovations, paint jobs, etc. Instead of coming to a decision as a couple, you'd be able to go \"Well it's MY house.\" And conversation over. It would make it feel more like she's a guest or something as opposed to a resident of the home.\n\nIn the end though, I think I have to go with NAH. I think you both have valid points. And I get that she hasn't paid for the house. It's yours, you earned it. But you're also entering a marriage. And legally speaking or not, this is supposed to be home to ***BOTH*** of you. How can it feel like home when it could be snatched away at any moment.\n\nI mean, there was just another post I saw earlier today of a couple that came in, kept things in their own names and Husband sold their house behind her back because it was in his name.

Or is she just expected to be happy she doesn't have to pay a mortgage?\n\nThis is just overall a terrible financial decision from her perspective for so many reasons", "Hmm good point, unless he agrees not to pursue those funds (and they put that in the prenup)", "I said this in my own comment elsewhere, but I wanted to jump in and add that you can tack on a \"transfer on death\" affidavit to a deed, so that the home does not even have to go through probate. It makes  way more sense than simply putting it in the will.\n\nMy wife did this for me as she is the one who made the down payment and is presently paying the mortgage while I take care of her/the home and go to school. I would NEVER expect to get half of what she is the only one paying into were we to divorce, but if (God forbid) something were to happen to her it's a huge reassurance to know I won't have to worry about keeping our home.", "You make some good points but she at the least needs to Tod and even that could be changed without her knowledge at any time. \n\nThis whole thing is untenable. As either person, I would walk away. Op to protect my assets. The finance to protect her future.", "I\u2019m going to inherit a house. My parents have said as much that I\u2019m going to get one (they have multiple that they have inherited). They will probably find a way to make it so that it is mine only and not my husband\u2019s (my parents have had multiple friends split up and the husband has gone after inheritance houses the wives had). I\u2019ve told this to my husband before we got married that this was a strong possibility and also don\u2019t take it personally due to their history. He\u2019s totally fine with it. He knows we are going to be living there together and he benefits from not having a huge rent payment. We live in Los Angeles area so we probably could never afford any of those houses on our own.", "I am right there with you. OP needs to hold onto his house. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is demanding to be put on the title is a huge red flag for me.", "Exactly.  Venting to your parent about your fiance/spouse seems immature.", "Why should OP contribute anything? If he's happy to cover the property taxes, etc, his future wife can save her own money to invest in real estate. Sure, it may only be a small, insignificant apartment to start off with but over 30+ years of marriage she can develop quite the property portfolio.", "I agree and I think that needs to be some sort of agreement. If he wants to have kids, and if it works out that she needs to stay home, then she should be added to the deed at that point. People really underestimate the value of a stay at home parent, and they also underestimate how much staying home with the kids completely fucks with your ability to save your own money or have a retirement fund, or to get back into the workforce.", "Big if. What if he stays home with the kids?", "Need to check state laws on that.  Het name is not on the deed.", "But she's suggesting that she would pay half for the new house. Leaving OP free to invest the money from the sale of his house elsewhere, which would remain his if they split.\n\nShe's offering negotiables, it's OP who isn't.\n\nYeah, she wants to share ownership of her home in some way. She's not insisting on half of his house, she's offered the only other compromise she can think of. That's why they need an independent financial adviser to help them find a compromise.\n\nShe was wrong to involve her family, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were the ones advising her that she needs to own part of her marital home.", "Agree. Why not buy a separate house and he keeps the current one in his name?\n\nWhy does he have to sell it?", "But what if they have kids? Will she be expected to be a stay at home parent? If so she basically has 0 earning power/savings and is basically homeless should he decide to kick her out years down the line. It might sound like she's getting a good deal right now with him paying for everything, but that's only the case if she's able to stay working and birth control never fails /s", "OP had the discipline to save and invest, why can't she?  Why shouldn't she?  She wants to live free of responsibilities and have a golden parachute.", "That seems like a budgeting issue, it\u2019s not like unspent money just disappears.", "I suppose he could pray she signs a pre-nuptial that says she gets nothing but doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s gonna do that and marriage was already on the table so I doubt you can go back to bf/gf", "Also, your earning potential is never the same after as significant break.", "She might still lose out on promotions, but she'd have more financial options.   \n\n\nHowever, and this is my personal opinion, the fact that it is HIS home and he controls every aspect of it to me is a big turnoff. I'd want the home I live in long-term (as he intends) to be mine as well, to invest in it and have a say about it. If he's not comfortable with his wife/partner doing that, I think that says a lot about their relationship and that they shouldn't get married.  \n\n\nFull disclosure, I have been married 25 years and sweetie and I share everything.", "Absolutely correct SpecialustAfter511. Any money she saves will not be hers alone but a marital asset", "Which I feel op would happily sign since he is perfectly content with his asset.", "I do agree with you 100% But if the value of OPs property goes up,  if he invest in something else. She will have the same claim. Where I\u2019m from everything going in is your own and you keep, anything gained during the relationship is then split if they split, including appreciation value on homes. \n\nCan also mean debt. She may be able to go 100k in debt without him knowing and he would be stuck with half of it. Laws be different for that all over. \n\nAlso the longer your are married the more claim she would have to any previous assets , prenups do not guarantee anything.", "I own the house my wife and I live in. I found this house while we were dating and spent 3 years fixing and upgrading it before we moved in. I invested all of the money into it. We have a prenuptial agreement that states if we divorce, I will pay her the ~$500/month she contributes towards the mortgage +7% interest. I pay for everything else, from repair costs to internet bill, including the $8.3k in taxes every year. But at the end of the day, it's my house. I couldn't replace the house/property for a million dollars. \n\nShe was initially upset about me not putting her on the mortgage, but doing some math with her she feels better knowing she would be walking away with a fairly large cash payout that she could use to purchase her own home.\n\nMarriage is all a compromise and figuring out what works for both parties. While it may not be \"fair\" from some perspectives that I alone have gained ~$600k in equity, I also put ALL of the initial investment upfront prior to our marriage. And although she wanted to help out, she didn't have the funds to make any sort of a difference. So why should I have to sell my dream property if we get divorced?", "No, because they will split any and all assets that get brought in by him DURING the Marriage.  \n\nShe has no reason to assume anything from before. They will still have a savings account, 401ks and all the other fun stuff people do with there money.", "A woman asked this very same question a month ago and everyone basically told her \"OH NO WAY GIRL!  This guy is a sleaze bag con artist!\"", "Why would he mention any of that? His post is about her, trying to strong arm him into giving her essentially the equivalent of $1 million because they\u2019re getting married. You notice she wants to make sure she has her name on it before they are married, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from, but this is classic gold digger territory.\n\nBring your fan blend and try to guilt him if her puppy dog eyes don\u2019t work. She made a fatal flaw, red flag territory for most men is when the woman brings in her family the moment she doesn\u2019t get her way, that is not at all how conflict resolution works from a supposed future wife. He has everything to lose, and she simply does not care about that she wants that house.\n\nI can almost guarantee you her family has been in contact with the lawyer to find out how long she needs to stay married before she can divorce him and get half the house, I guarantee you if he holds out long enough, he\u2019s going to find out", "Yeah I wouldn't agree to these terms if I were her either. This is basically \"What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine\" before the marriage even starts", "This. For the person moving into OPs house, it's not just about finances, there is also a power imbalance and future security at stake. It also stings to hear your SO expects you to screw him over even if he's just trying to be practical. \n\nPeople are running with the idea that she would get to live there for free and contribute nothing financially, that she could put 100% of her money into savings until she can price match him on a house, or just hoard it forever and he will never say anything about it. OP may have implied this with the comment about her mortgage savings, but I don't think this is the deal she's getting at all. He said she would be saving \\~15k a year, which I HIGHLY doubt is her whole salary. \n\nOP isn't necessarily wrong for protecting his assets, but this is a choice he's making, and she's well within her right to feel put off by it.", "Except property appreciate more than savings. She foregoes buying a joint housing asset (if they were to move to somewhere where they could afford it) by moving in with him so there is a big financial cost to her in doing that.   I don't think he should put her on the deed but,  I agree with others, that it's probably going to take a financial advisor to work out what's fair.", "I agree with setting something up so that the property doesn\u2019t need to be sold to upon divorce. \n\nI just couldn\u2019t be in a marriage where there was still \u201cyour money\u201d and \u201cmy money\u201d for anything other than de minimus amounts, especially with kids.", "Remember the stock market bubbles, housing market crashes, etc?  Easy to end up with less than you started with.", ">not paying any household expenses for years\n\nOP doesn't say that though. He says that he's willing to pay tax and maintenance.\n\nBut what if they have children and need more bedrooms? Is OP paying the full price on the extension to his house? Or is she expected to chip in? Will they split utilities? What about if she wants to decorate \"her home\"? Who is paying for that improvement?\n\nI don't think she's entitled to half the house. I do think that OPs suggestion isn't a good start to having a home together and they need to sit down with an independent financial advisor to reach a better compromise.", "That\u2019s the thing, though. She wants half that asset immediately just because", "That is what marriage has become. I have seen so many people lose half of their life savings or assets due to marrying the wrong person. It is not the money loss that is so hard, it is the effort put in that is lost. Also, the average person only has so much money earning potential in their lifetime, so losing a large percentage will limit your retirement comfort level, especially with multiple failed marriages. People need to protect themselves in these times against golddiggers.", "I couldn't be in a marriage where there wasn't. We've been together since we were teenagers, 20+ years with home and kid, and she has her money she can spend however she likes while I have mine (25% of our paychecks, respectively, and she makes slightly more).\n\nYou're a team, not conjoined twins."]}
