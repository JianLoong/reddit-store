She enthusiastically said yes. We told my stepdad and he said he was happy for my mom. He and my mom started dating when I was 6, he moved in when I was 9 and they got married when I was 10. When mom first started dating him she sat me down and told me he wasn't ever going to replace dad and that if he ever pressured me to do something I was uncomfortable with, like call him dad, I could tell her and she would nip it in the bud. She made it clear our relationship didn't have to fit anyone else's mold and she reminded me of this again when he moved in and when they got married. She also asked for my feelings on things every step of the way and I liked my stepdad and cared about him so it was easy to agree to him moving in and to them getting married. I never called him dad or really thought of him as a dad figure. He was something different and it wasn't nothing but I'm not sure I would have a word to describe it. But we got along great. It was just never the same as my relationship with my mom.\n\nI always dreamed of mom walking me down the aisle and dancing with me at my wedding. She was there and always put me first and we're our own team. But she also loved and never let him be just a piece of history I never knew anything about. I always appreciated that and her efforts to keep me involved in his family, or the good parts anyway lol.\n\nA few weeks ago my stepdad's parents texted me with a weird comment about father of the bride's needing a little extra detail to go into their wedding suit. It came out of nowhere and I didn't reply because I honestly had no idea what it was about really. A few days after that I saw them and they asked why he wasn't in rehearsal for our father/daughter dance. I told them there was nothing to rehears and mom was dancing with me. I said my stepdad and I would dance at a different point on the day. They said father of the bride is the dance not mother of the bride. I told them he wasn't going to have that traditional role. Another day then they mentioned it to me and I asked them why they kept bringing it up. They said I should be ashamed and I humiliated my stepdad and he was so upset that he went to them. I spoke to my stepdad and he confirmed he went to his parents with the hope I would see the error of my ways and he didn't want to piss off mom by saying something directly. But he told me he deserved to be father of the bride and not stepfather of the bride. I told my mom what he did and she was furious.

I don't get how that irony was lost on them.", "She was pissed and even mentioned the promise she made me back then. She was hoping after all this time it hadn't been needed. Little did we know that it was after I grew up and moved out that it would need to be carried through.", "Yeah real mature actions by a grown up man! \n\nEdit to add: it IS different. You dealt with the situation head on and in a mature way. He behaved like a little kid. They behaved like AHs - it\u2019s none of their business.", "They are way out of pocket on this one. I would contact them back in a group chat type message that you are a Woman who has made a decision about YOUR wedding and that you will hold YOUR wedding as you see fit. Tell them that you are not going to entertain their poor attempt at manipulating you and your wedding. And if they keep it up, your guest list will be trimmed accordingly. Call them out directly on it. \n\nHold your wedding as you see fit. Don't make changes to make other people happy. Your step-dad is going to ruin the relationship the two of you do have if he continues with this fu*kery.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA-your wedding. Your choice. I\u2019m a bit pissed that they made the comment about \u201crunning to Mommy like a little girl\u2026..\u201d. I have four daughters. From 28 to 34. They ALLLLL run to Mommy to talk about things going on in their lives, good, bad and ugly. There\u2019s nothing wrong with gave your mom walk you down the aisle, dance with her or go to her when you are upset about something. However, now I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recognize him or his family at the wedding.", "How is it any different? He's a grown adult you're actually younger than him and he's married to her. He should've talked to you and your mother what he did was a juvenile move and if they say otherwise, how different is the situation really he's much older he should be able to manage it like an adult", "He tried to do an end-run around your mother's boundary of never pressuring you. He thought he could loop-hole her boundary. That's manipulative, dishonest and disrespectful to your mother as well as to you.\n\nGiven his parents' equally manipulative and spiteful behaviour, I can't imagine this is the first time he's tried to do something behind your mother's back or manipulated her boundaries. I think his mask dropped a bit here.", "They're hypocrites, plain and simple. \n\nThere was never any way to keep your mom out of it. You'd already offered her the job of walking you up the aisle/dancing with you, and rescinding that offer would have needed an explanation.", "The right response to that is \u201cI guess I believe in honesty and transparency in a marriage more than stepdad and his family does. That really helps cement why he doesn\u2019t have a place in the ceremony.\u201d", "He is your mom\u2019s husband and you are your mom\u2019s daughter.\n\nThere is no connection other than that. She should be left out of *nothing* between the two of you.\n\nNTA", "How the hell were they going to \"hide\" you canceling the walk & dance with your mother, from your mother? Nuts.", "So his excuse is he hid his bad behavior from his wife.  Wow what a jerk.", "INFO : How did he expect to keep your mother out of it, and hide it from her, when he was actively (through his mommy and daddy) trying to kick your mother out of dancing with you at your wedding?!", "Please ask them directly why their little boy of a son needs their help at his advanced age.", "It\u2019s even a worse look to let your mommy and daddy do your dirty work. He want to take something tremendously special from your mom(his wife) but wanted every one else to be the bad guy. \n\nI hope your mom sees how manipulative his actions are!", "That's a good point - not only did he try to go around your boundary, he tried to steal the moment from his own wife and your mom! Gross.", "So, how long is he riding the couch?\n\nI would also cancel any moments at the reception for him, and even chuck him out of the wedding party.", "What was his plan? Shove your mom out of the way and walk you down the aisle", "Maybe they have the \"rules for thee, not for me,\" mentality or they're just so entitled they think their \\*precious baby boy\\* can do no wrong.", "Because that was their baby boy! And they were standing op to the mean old woman doing him wrong(eye roll)!", "You're mother is the best!", "Yeah. Go hug your mom tight for being a badass parent. I wish you the best mother/daughter dance ever.", "You have an awesome mother. With the step-parent horror stories that can appear on this sub, she\u2019s a good standard for looking out for your own kid.", "NTA. Put your foot down and have that mother-daugther aisle walk and dance!", "Stepdad made it all these years without crossing your boundaries, and you even set up a special dance with him. I've got to think that it's his parents that went crazy about this and set him off. If he didn't tell them to back off, he should have. NTA!", "Not only are you NTA your mom is a champ. I'm glad you get to have her walk you down the aisle", "This.\n\nYou went to your mum to tell her to deal with her husband and her inlaws.\n\nHe went to his parents to try and help them guilt OP into doing what he feels entitled to.\n\nI'm sure her family and friends all know what type of relationship they have, so it won't come as any type of surprise that he doesn't have that role.", "Yes. \n\nYou did the right thing, OP.", ">And if they keep it up, your guest list will be trimmed accordingly. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if OPs mum is already considering this given her stance throughout the relationship and her reaction to the news. If I were her I would be starting to wonder how else my husband and in laws had been going behind my back to manipulate me and my child into doing what they want", "> Given his parents' equally manipulative and spiteful behaviour, I can't imagine this is the first time he's tried to do something behind your mother's back or manipulated her boundaries. I think his mask dropped a bit here.\n\n\nYes. One wonders what else is going on with him that OP and her mom don't know about.", "OPs mom restored my fate in humanity... Even by just a little bit", "Fr, so many stories here are about parents favoring new spouses"]}
