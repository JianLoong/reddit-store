The bag goes in a bowl with cool water to bring the temperature down.", "Ideally, nobody would. But that assumes people are all in the know about food storage tips and can even agree on it. It's not out of the question that a mom would do this", "She does", "If OP is not well off, shes probably pumping into a bottle not a disposable bag and freezing it in the bottle. You need to cool the new milk down before pouring it into the already frozen milk otherwise it will partially defrost and be unsafe.\n\nWith a young baby, you only produce tiny amounts of milk, so one bottle could hold many sessions worth of pumped milk.", "I suppose the only saving grace is that he didn't take *all* the milk then try to hide it by pouring cow milk into the bowl. The baby could have gotten really sick from that.", "Sure, though if there was a starting suspicion, it feels like a missed opportunity to talk about this stuff beforehand.\nIt is like waiting for it to escalate. Missed opportunity to talk through things, u know. It just doesn't feel very constructive (while yes, definitely the husband was not constructive either with his secret behaviour).", "What really supports your fetish theory is that OP writes: \n\n\u201che informed me that he was curious and how it\u2019s not the first time he had breast milk.\u201d  \n\nLike what? Did he buy it off of Facebook or something? It really sounds like he tried it before the incident with OP and not just as a baby. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s wrong for a partner to try it but it has to be consensual.", "Ehhhhhh that seems a bit of a drag.", "Yes.", "This is my thought process to this sub as well unless the story is outrageously fake, which this doesn\u2019t seem to be.", "You might have that policy, but I definitely don't. I'm so tired of the endless posts about the immature mother-in-law with the new husband no one likes, who won't babysit because she dislikes children. When they combine it with wearing white to a wedding, that's extra annoying. They always \"forget\" a ton of information for later, too, so they can do a surprise twist once people have already starting making judgements. \n\nIt's such a dumb creative writing exercise and I wish people would quit humoring them. In fact, I stopped voting on this sub at least a year ago because I don't want to give them any engagement at all", "I think we all know that isn\u2019t what he meant.", "It does taste better though. I dislike the taste of cow's milk unless it is part of something else (e.g. hot cocoa, cheese), but I did like the taste of my own breastmilk (I drank \"expired\" breastmilk rather than throwing it out because these are my nutrients and I'd rather get them back than throw them out). It just tasted right.\n\nThat said, \"motherly\" is not a description that comes to mind and I would have been furious if my husband had put his wants before our baby's needs and my reasonable comfort.", "Believe it or not it is quit common for people to drink breatsmilk for physical reasons. The nutritional benefits of breastmilk can benefit anyone at any age.", "Based on his response, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d be very forthcoming. Odds are, OP knew him better than we do and likely knew how to handle the situation. Anyone sneaking and hiding the fact that they are stealing is unlikely to be honest about it.", "I thought it was a reference to him having breastmilk as a baby \ud83d\ude2d", "Eh, it could be a fetish but it isn't necessarily. He could have tasted it with a previous partner or even during childhood. I remember being curious about the taste when I was seven and my mom gave birth to my sister, so she let me try it. \n\nBut either way, you're absolutely right about the consensuality being the most important part. He didn't ask permission and he wasn't making use of excess milk that wasn't being used. It was needed milk which he was covertly stealing. And when found out he tried to reverse the responsibility and tell OP that she was overreacting.", "He enjoys the \u201cextra motherly taste\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cnot the first time\u201d he\u2019s tried breast milk.  This is *absolutely* a fetish.", "Oh yeah? What\u2019s harsh about the comment?", "If the choice of words makes you uncomfortable that's too bad, it's literally what OP's husband is doing.", "I mean I agree that some *are* annoying but this one was new.", "Try a few brands of lactose free milk. Most are revolting, but some have that sickly sweet breastmilk flavour.\n\nIf you are in Australia, try the Woolies homebrand blue carton lactose free carton.", "If there was milk missing, and she wasn't drinking it, what are other scenarios where milk would go missing, other than consumption. She didn't mention pets or visitors or anything like that, so let's assume it's just mother, father, and infant with milk sitting in a bowl on the table, as that is the only info given", "Exactly, it sounds like a fetish. It\u2019s gross basically inobfir jack of a better word at that moment.", "I mean technically most of us have tried breastmilk, we were all just (hopefully) too young to remember.\n\nBut somehow I don't think that's what he was referring to.", "Liking the taste of breast milk? Like doesn\u2019t it have to get you off in some way for it to be a fetish?", "I also think it's a little weird to jump straight to the fetish aspect with nothing pointing to that. He might just like the taste, as weird as that is.", "I mean he\u2019s a jerk for taking the milk without asking, but I think it is off on the conclusion that he\u2019s got some creepy fetish about taking her fluids.", "Weirdly enough, this is not new. There's been multiple posts about people stealing breast milk or drinking it without realizing. It reads like someone's fetish material. But they space out their posts enough most people don't seem to notice.", ">You can\u2019t mix fresh pumped (warm) milk and cooled milk together\n\nYou kinda can, at least if the alternative is leaving milk out at room temp. Scientifically, there is zero reason not to store milk immediately in the fridge, please chill it ASAP to reduce bacterial presence.\n\nMixing warm milk with cold milk will warm it up, which isn't ideal. But it's even worse to just leave milk sitting out all warm", ">You can\u2019t mix fresh pumped (warm) milk and cooled milk together \n\nWhat? Why? Also what? How long are you leaving it out to 'cool'? Like it's not going to get to fridge temps out on the bench.", "It's body temp. You might not want to put a whole hot fresh out of the oven lasagna in a fridge because it'll bring up the temp of the fridge, 100ml of body temp milk isn't going to do that.", "Millions of people can all have misconceptions that can end up being dangerous- do you know how many people spray raw chicken with water?\n\nMilk, and for that matter any food that can spoil, should be put away in the fridge ASAP. Cooling at room temp allows microbes more time to spread. Then when the milk is chilled you can mix it with any other milk you have stored.", "It's not warm enough for this to be necessary. Expressed milk should go straight into the fridge, freezer or baby.", "Well I don't know and neither did she which is why she filmed. I don't think you guys are taking into account how far the human mind can go when confronted to something they can't explain. \n\nIs the most likely solution \"my husband is taking it\"? Yes sure! \n\nIs that where your mind would go if you had no suspicion? Maybe! But hers didn't. \n\nI don't see any ill intention behind filming a bowl of milk. Maybe it was fast condensation because it's warm in the room. Maybe after the milk settles in the bowl, it gets thinner and therefore less full. Who knows? She didn't so she filmed. \n\nEven if, and that's a big if, she did it to catch her husband red-handed, I would still believe stealing her milk is worse than filming him doing something he's actively hiding from her and knows is wrong. But that's my opinion.", "How is it gross?? We drink milk from 2000 different sources. But the milk that\u2019s actually meant for humans is gross???", "[Per the CDC website: \u201cIt is best to cool freshly expressed milk before combining it with older, previously cooled or frozen milk.\u201d](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/recommendations/faq.html)", "You don\u2019t put hot things in fridges because they spoil faster. Has Gordon Ramsey taught you nothing, you absolute donkey???", "Well, yes, but if you've always heard \"don't put warm things in the fridge\" it makes sense why OP would do it if they're just following that advice.", "You generally pump until the flow stops and then, if able, wait a beat and pump again for 2nd let down. You don't just pump what you're going to use right then, again in general. Pumping is usually done for storage, especially once a baby reaches a few months. And if she's cooling it, that leans it towards it's being stored.", "Because he did it without her consent.", "For babies.  Not an adult man with a fetish. Why do you think he hid it from OP if its so okay.", "But you\u2019re not cooling it enough by leaving it on the counter. What that recommendation means is if you have a container of breastmilk in the fridge at 40* F, your fresh milk needs to be separately refrigerated to 40* F before you mix it into the container. Not to leave it on the counter so it \u201ccools\u201d from 98.5* to 75* (or room temp), it\u2019s still too warm to mix with refrigerated milk. Also a cooling bowl? Why is it in a bowl?

I\u2019m sure your mother didn\u2019t tell you everything when you were 15. Pumping is difficult for many women. I struggled to keep my supply up. I was pumping and storing it, because I worked and needed it for the next day. I only had a day and a half on hand at some points. The biggest issue is OP is not ok with it.", "Your comments about \u201ca few pumps\u201d made it sound like you imagined breast milk to be expressed as rapidly and easily as milking a cow. For a cow it may be only a few pumps or a few seconds, that is not the case for the majority of women. \n\nYour comment to which I replied sounds exceedingly flippant and undermining towards people who are working hard to produce breastmilk for their infants. I am genuinely happy that your perception of your mother\u2019s experience of breastfeeding was so positive. I do wonder how difficult it actually was for her though, as even at 15 I am sure there were things she kept quiet from you. It\u2019s also possible that by baby 7 she was experienced enough that she didn\u2019t have any problems, whereas with her older children she had the same very common difficulties that most women experience, you were just too young to be aware of them. \n\nI would respectfully suggest that when wanting to discuss emotive topics on which you are almost entirely ignorant, it would be prudent to do at least a small bit of research into the subject so you have a brief understanding of why it is an emotive topic for others.", "That doesn't matter, all that matters is that she said NO. It is her breastmilk and it is not up to you or him or anyone to try to change her mind.", "Nobody is invalidation anyone.  Why don't you get that.  My mother's experience is offered only to illustrate why I don't understand the issue.   I did not know until today about the pumping issue.   Accusing me of things that aren't happening does not advance the conversation.", "Thank you!  I was wrong to not realize this would be a sensitive issue.  Sorry my ignorance shows.   The suggestion about looking before leaping is cogent.  My respect and sensitivity to women's issues is part of my everyday life (this topic was an obvious blind spot).  My mother gave me the foundation for me to make the life that I earned.  My wife of 42 years is an angel that I don't deserve.", "Who's trying to defend anybody?  I just want to understand.  If women's response is to get angry and criticize, then how does anyone learn anything?  My mother breast fed 7 children and I don't remember any discomfort or displeasure from her.   I was 15 when she had her youngest, so would remember.", "She didn't say no until she found out. While I do think he should have asked, it's possible he didn't grasp the full scope of what he was doing. We don't know for sure. If he takes it now that she has said no, yes he is in the wrong. \nMy original comment was addressing the fact that y'all turned this into a whole new issue. She didn't say anything about the baby being deprived, y'all did. Her issue was being \"sickened\" by him consuming it and being frustrated by pumping all together.", "Then maybe your mom should be breastfeeding this guy", "I didn't say the baby was deprived. Drinking her breastmilk, which she intends to be completely used for feeding her child, is taking food from her baby. It doesn't matter if she has extra. It doesn't matter if she could pump more. She doesn't want him to drink it. End of story"]}
