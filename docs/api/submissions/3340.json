These are questions that come to mind which makes me curious about what and why you have your opinion.", "Yes, because that's exactly what I said. Reach much? You said he was taking food from his child's mouth. That implies the child is not getting enough or there is an issue with the supply. I simply pointed out that I'm sure op would have mentioned if her child was suffering from the loss or lack of supply which she didn't.", "Perhaps the advice in other countries is different but where I live the advice is always put pumped breast milk you want to store straight in the fridge to get it out of the bacteria danger zone as quickly as possible. It's warm once you have pumped and the volume of milk isn't going to change the base temperature of the fridge.\n\nThe advice was also to never mix milk as you would need to dispose milk after a certain time frame so mixing was not advised", "I have also breastfeed and stored breast milk. As I replied to another commenter the medical advice where I live is to put expressed milk straight into the fridge and don't mix refrigerated milk.\n\nSource: https://www.medela.co.uk/breastfeeding/mums-journey/storing-and-thawing-breast-milk", "To be fair we don't know what this \"cooling bowl\" looks like.", "She's breastfeeding to feed her baby. That is why it is worth the burden. Not so an adult man can have a particular flavor in his tea.", "I can only assume that you\u2019ve never pumped or fed an infant before. \nBreastfeeding is recommended as the best way to feed infants and given the issues with accessing formula some mothers prefer it as a more reliable option. \nPumping enough for a cup of tea is not just \u201ca few extra pumps\u201d or \u201ca few seconds\u201d for many women. Pumping is unpleasant and fairly hard work for most women, and getting the necessary \u201csplash\u201d for his teas might take a woman an extra 5-20 mins depending on how well she responds to a breast pump. Women are not cows- it\u2019s not just a few pumps or a few seconds.", "She is pumping the amount she wishes her child to drink. He is reducing that amount. To get the amount she wants she would have to pump extra milk. He is not entitled to that.", "This yes exactly- though maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing how one stores it?", "You are correct. These peoole know nothing about proper food storage.", "Okay ... so some of the milk is used for an unintended purpose.  Is spilling some of it an unintended purpose?  We're talking about a tablespoon of milk. While mom should have her way with regard to the well being of the child and well being of herself at this stage, it escapes me that a tablespoon of milk affects well being.  And the inconvenience to pump a tablespoon of milk seems pretty small.   Aren't breast pumps electric these days?   Just curious.  IMO whatever your decision is your business and not mine to criticize.", "Of course women are not cows.  There has been nothing but respect here.  Is a request for information any kind of suggestion of disrespect or disagreement?   My mother breast fed 7 children.   I don't remember her showing any measure of discomfort or distress.   I was 15 when she had her youngest, so if she was unhappy I would remember it.", "Spilling it is unintentional. Him taking it and drinking it is intentional. I can't see how you're racing to defend the man when it's her breastmilk and she has already decided how it would like to be used. If she doesn't want her husband drinking her breastmilk that is final. She needs it to feed their baby.", "I honestly think people are gut reacting to the consumption of breast milk and the stigma surrounding it. They just don't want to admit it. I struggled with breast feeding. That stuff was far more prescious than gold but I wouldn't have had this visceral of a reaction to my husband using a tablespoon or 2."]}
