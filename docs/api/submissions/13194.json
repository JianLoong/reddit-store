That's the issue with her - or one of many.   \n\nShe wants to spend time with you without your friends around.   A perfectly normal thing to want to do with your boyfriend.   She's feeling pushed to the side because of your schedule and the fact that you don't seem to want to carve out any time for just her. \n\nShe also needs friends who she can see on a regular basis, but that's not a you issue, that is something she does need to do for herself.   Being an introvert, it will make it difficult.   But introverted people can do difficult things.   \n\nGoing out to eat on weekends isn't enough for her.   Rightly so.   \n\nHow invested are you in the relationship?   Is she just someone who warms your bed at night, or is she someone you see being with long term?    \n\nIf you're not in it for the long haul she deserves to know and have the opportunity to decide whether or  not you're worth her time.   \n\nYou dismissed her direct concern - spending time together.   \nSo, YTA.", "YTA\n\nShe very plainly said she wants to spend more alone time with you.

Based on your answers in the comments, where you say you guys spend only Saturday morning together *alone*. One Saturday morning during the whole week. Of course she will feel lonely. She is able to communicate with you, listen to her!", "Obviously OP is not invested in his relationship. YTA. Let her go. Let her find someone who wants to spend time with her", "YTA she asked for more one on one time with you and you told her to go find some friends. No wonder she isn\u2019t talking to you", "YTA.

Your girlfriend feels like you don\u2019t spend quality time alone, she\u2019s struggling to make friends and your advice was \u201cmake some?\u201d How fucking useless is that? Spend more time with your girlfriend and actually listen to her and empathise.", "YTA. She wants to be with you more and you prioritize your friends over her.", "YTA. Dear God, she just wants more one on one time with YOU. Not with other people. YOU. So, show her that you care about her and her feelings and spend more than just Saturday morning with her. Plan some day trips, or weekends away, have dinner one on one during the week sometimes. Something to show her that she\u2019s a priority for you because right now you are putting her pretty low on your priority list.", "YTA. Don't be in a relationship if you can't prioritize it at least a little bit. She doesn't want friends, she wants You. Duh.", "You don\u2019t need us, but for the record YTA.", "YTA she sounds like an accessory to you, not a priority", "YTA imo because it seems like you didn't listen and/or told her you can't find a way to spend more time with her because of friends and work. She isn't just lonely, she wants more time with you, just you alone. I don't know about work but maybe take a little time from friend stuff and add a little time for just her.", "YTA, she is going to eventually find a new \"friend\" to replace you if you don't see the cards she is dealing with.

She should make some new friends, including a new boyfriend. \n\nYTA.", "YTA Do you even like your gf?", "Yes, you certainly are because she is communicating that she just wants to be with you more and you respond by telling her to get more friends.", "\"I feel like we never spend any time together and it's getting to me\"\n\n\"You need to find other people to spend time with\"\n\nHow is it possible you not only had that conversation and didn't understand what she was saying, but you also wrote your post and *still* don't get it? YTA.", "What do you do for a living that takes hours to get ready for?", "YTA.\n\nI walked into this thinking it was going to go the other way because she's some clingy gf dependent upon you for her whole social life, but it's not that.  You completely dismissed her actual problem.\n\nThe problem isn't that she's lonely or dissatisfied with the amount of time she spends with other people.  The problem is that she is not getting quality alone time with you - which is something that is completely reasonable in a relationship and in fact recommended if you actually give a damn about your relationship and want to nurture it.\n\nAnd you dismissed her and told her to find friends so she has something to occupy herself while you continue ignoring her for YOUR friends.  You're either incredibly dumb or you don't actually give a damn about your relationship with her and are just playing the long game of keeping her on the hook to see how much sex can you get before she finally musters up some self-respect and dumps you because you don't actually treat her like someone you enjoy spending time with and want to foster a relationship with.\n\nYou honestly don't sound like you're ready or interested in a relationship with anyone if playing games with your buddies is higher on your hierarchy than your significant other.  At a certain point, you have to learn to strike a balance in fostering all of your relationships, romantic and platonic, which may mean slightly less platonic in your life rather than shoe-horning your romantic into the platonic.", "What an extrovert says: just be more outgoing and make some new friends\n\nWhat an introvert hears: just develop some superhero abilities, it can't be that hard\n\nNAH, introvert/extrovert relationships need more work, but they can be successful", "I am exactly like your girlfriend. She wants validation. She wants help opening up. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but you should try to understand her better.\n\nEdit: after reading your comments I do think YTA. It\u2019s honestly really hard being someone with hardly any friends, especially when you have a partner that has plenty of friends. It\u2019s an awkward feeling of \u201cI want to hang out with him and his friends, but I don\u2019t want to seem overbearing or annoying\u201d. I think she needs your support", "YTA, a tiny bit. The biggest issue is the lack of 1-on-1. Yeah, your girlfriend could have more of her own friends, but that isn\u2019t her problem. She\u2019s told you that she doesn\u2019t feel like she sees you enough.\n\nYou say you go out to eat on weekends, but if that\u2019s just how you feed yourselves, it\u2019s no longer special. Plus, how long is a meal in comparison to what sound like nights out with friends? Gf wants to see more of you, so she tags along to outings with your friends. This is not balance, it\u2019s cramming everything into one day. \n\nYou need to manage your time better, full stop.", "YTA. She isn't saying she feels lonely because she has no friends. \n\nShe's saying she wants more time with YOU. You, alone. You, her partner. You, whom she loves. YOU, whom she would like to see without anyone else around.\n\nSure, she can make other friends. That won't change the fact that she's missing **YOU**.", "i was going to say nta because it *is* important for partners to each have separate friends outside of the relationship. however after reading some of ops comments it seems like you don\u2019t really make time for her alone *without* your friends also being present. from what i read it seems like you\u2019re only really spending quality time together on weekends, and on both days your friends are also included. \ni think she was hinting that she wasn\u2019t lonely in a general sense, but that she felt lonely within the relationship. \n\ni don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily an asshole but if it\u2019s too much to balance work, gf, and friends, then maybe you need to rethink the relationship.", "My girlfriend is also extremely introverted. I'm introverted as well, but I don't have the social anxiety that she does. I go to concerts, visit the few friends I have, go on bike rides, and go to work. She works from home half her week, occasionally will take our dog out for a walk alone, occasionally meets up with her work friends. Most of our free time we spend together. She used to feel really lonely as well. If I was working long hours at work or going to too many concerts. She likes being alone about half the time and she likes being with me about half the time. We figured it out together after talking about it.\n\nShe doesn't like to spend much time in the company of others, but I'm that special person she does want around all the time. She's comfortable with me, she's entertained by me, she enjoys my company. She's a very private person and I'm the only person she tells most things to. She loves me.\n\nPeople have different social capacities and needs. If yours and your girlfriend's don't line up, perhaps it's time to move on. But if you truly love her and care about her and want to grow in a relationship with her, you're going to talk to her instead if being so dismissive. YTA, but you can make a comeback if you want to.", "Bet when she breaks up with you, you\u2019ll say it was out of nowhere", "NAH, but I think you are not hearing her, to me it seems more like she want spend more quality one ine one time with you and not to tag with your friends all the time. I know that feeling, I'm introvert married to extrovert. At times what I was missing was quality alone time with my partner where I don't have to mask to appeal his friend group. My husband had impression we were spending ton of time together but for me it was either to tag with his friend or to maintain our home, what I was lacking was free time spent with him like going for a walk, play game together, go for nice meal just two of us.... It took us years to balance our needs and now we are balancing it all over again when we threw two kids into the mix.", "Nobody\u2019s the AH here, you both need some time for your relationship outside of friend encounters. She\u2019s asking for time with just you, not time with new friends. Maybe prioritize spending time just the two of you a couple times a week instead of making your outings with friends m.", "NAH", "Definitely NTA, but I feel for her.  She DOES need to make friends or get a hobby, or something that is fulfilling to her outside of being with you.  You can't be each other's everything and that's how she has made the dynamic in your relationship.  Not on purpose of course but it's clearly what's comfortable for her.  That's a lot of pressure on you.   Examine her childhood and her parent's relationship (or lack thereof) and you will see why she is the way she is.  I think she should go talk to a therapist, to help herself find fulfillment and happiness, and figure out what blocks her from reaching out to people to make friends.", "NTA. I did have a friend who had limited time, like yourself,  and always mixed random friends. I hated that because they felt like endless networking events,  however well-intentioned. BUT that friend wasn't spending 1:1 time with me each weekend. I simply chose to see her when I sensed it wasn't a group invitation, politely decline the mixers promising endless small talk,  and socialize in smaller groups that I could manage. I'm an introvert as well,  and what you're describing is needy,  not the need to recharge on her part. She's your friend,  not your dependent and not your responsibility.", "Noone is the AH, you both seem to have different needs in a relationship. That is tricky...", "NTA\u2026\n\nShe follows you around? Yeah she needs some friends\u2026..ASAP\u2026 that\u2019s weird behavior", "NTA. You're not responsible for her lack of social skills. She needs to interact with other humans and actually talk to people. She's lived her life in isolation, which means that she's never developed even the most basic social skills. The only way to move past her anxiety is to allow herself to be uncomfortable. As she devotes more time actually engaging in social situations the more comfortable she will become and her anxiety will recede. Right now she's like a person from an isolated tribe being dropped in the middle of Tokyo. \n\n\nYou're doing what you can. It's time for her to be brave and push herself. It's not as hard as she thinks it is. You aren't her entire social life, a weighted blanket, an emotional support animal, her therapist, her life coach, or friendship matchmaker. You're her boyfriend. \n\nBeing able to enjoy time alone is great. Being unable to function in basic situations is a problem, her problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
