For as long as I've known her, she's been a strict vegetarian: no meat at all; if we go to a restaurant and there's complimentary soup, she doesn't hesitate to flat out ask if there are meat products in the broth.\n\nBack in December, she met someone new where she works, a younger girl by the name of Sheila. Sheila is a vegan, and doesn't even want to be around a place where cheese might exist. She's been chatting with my girlfriend, Michaela, frequently, and Michaela apparently has been telling Sheila and their other workmates that Michaela is a vegan. She's gone so far as to put on Facebook ridiculous posts such as, \"loving my vegan lifestyle!\" \"Salads for lunch, being a vegan is great!\"\n\nThe whole time she's making these comments, I'll see her eating cheese, drinking milk, etc. She's still keeping with her vegetarian diet, but is definitely not a vegan by any stretch of the term.\n\nI've pretty much tried to ignore it even though it's been a little annoying hearing her talk about it, but I snapped yesterday at our Easter dinner, which Michaela insisted be held at our home. Michaela invited Sheila (who I honestly didn't like, because when she was looking at the dinner spread, she made comments about Michaela putting up with so many animal products), and I'd had enough.\n\nSo when Michaela and Sheila struck up a conversation in which Sheila proceeded to insult our food once again, I interrupted, saying that, \"it really isn't a problem for Michaela, given that she's not a vegan. In fact, I watched her eat an omelet just this morning.\"\n\nMichaela began to deny it and claim that I was lying, but Sheila looked a little upset that Michaela had been \"bullshitting her\". (It's genuinely lost on me how a person can get upset over their friend eating an egg, but then again, I am not on a diet.) Long story short, Sheila is mad at Michaela for faking veganism for months, and now Michaela is upset with me because I \"should have kept my mouth shut\".\n\nAITA for calling out my girlfriend on not being a vegan?\n\n\n**Brief update:** I talked to Michaela today and asked her what was going on and why she felt the need to lie about it. I told her I was sorry for upsetting her and causing an uncomfortable situation between her and a friend, and she told me that she genuinely liked speaking to Sheila, and while she hadn't expected her lie to get as far as it did, she wanted to gain a bond/friendship with Sheila. Apparently though, Sheila hasn't spoken to her outside of work related topics.", "created_utc": 1681096355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h5a7u/aita_for_calling_my_gf_out_on_not_being_a_vegan/", "score": 2603, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes calling people out is the only way to hold them accountable. Could you have done it better? Probably. But if she didn't want to face these consequences she shouldn't have lied.\n\nSecond, I am vegan, I'd like to shed some light here on why vegans are upset about animal products, including eggs. \n\nAnimals are harmed for these products. When humans choose to consume eggs, meat, dairy, etc. you're paying for another sentient being to be abused, objectified, and killed at a fraction of their natural lifespan against their will. This is upsetting because in the modern world humans don't need to do these things, but continue to do so because we're way too good at compartmentalizing the harm we cause others, especially when it isn't happening in front of us and because historically humans have viewed animals as robots and totally disregarded that they are also sentient beings that experience emotion and thought, and value their own lives. \n\nFor eggs specifically, there's a lot of problems. First you have the part where in hatcheries, on the first day of new chicks lives male chicks are separated out from the rest because they won't be able to lay eggs. Then they're usually tossed into industrial grinders en masse. Egg laying hens have had their genetics manipulated to have 30x the amount of periods that their bodies would have naturally, which takes an enormous toll on their health. These birds, before human intervention, lay around 12 - 30 eggs per year. Now they lay hundreds. So many birds die from prolapsed cloacas or other problems related to constantly producing eggs and having nutrients sapped from their bodies as a result. People also often think that these birds aren't killed which isn't true. Egg production declines after a couple years, if they survive that long due to the genetic manipulation I explained before, and then they're sent to slaughter for not being as useful. Birds used for breeding are often kept in horrid conditions as well. And terms like free range, cage free etc. don't really mean that much in terms of quality of life for these animals. The overwhelming majority are still kept in sheds hardly ever seeing the outside world. Even best case scenario, you're still benefitting from harming these animals as they all have origins in hatcheries and have their genetics manipulated to their detriment. Even homesteaders kill their chickens when they're no longer useful to them. There is absolutely no kindness in this no matter how you approach it.\n\nI am vegan because I think it is wrong to harm other sentient beings when I have the option not to do that. Using other sentient beings for food, entertainment, etc. when I can just not do that is in direct conflict with the values I say I have. So it seems the only logical course of action is being vegan. It isn't just a food choice - it's a value I hold that affects the food choices I make. I could care less what people eat if no one is intentionally harming others, but that's not the case with animal products at all in the modern world. Of course it bothers me that others choose to harm animals when they have the option not to do so, and if I or others like me never speak up for those being harmed, nothing will ever change. We are choosing to live in a world where we harm others even though we've reached a point in our development where we no longer need to do this and understand that we wouldn't want it done to us. It doesn't have to be that way.\n\n\nIt is especially frustrating because most people will say they don't want to harm animals, but then go on to do things that harm animals even though they can just choose to consume/do something else. So saying that is meaningless if your actions don't reflect it. And it is upsetting, knowing how much avoidable suffering humans are creating via their consumption choices, and knowing it doesn't have to be that way. Especially for someone like me who volunteers nearly full time (on top of my actual full time job) in animal rescue for farmed animals. I see the abuse/neglect/death/suffering so often and I know that the inconveniences humans may incur going vegan are just.... so infinitesimal compared to the pain being created so humans can enjoy the taste of someone else's body or secretions. Of course I want to do something about it.", "Imagine being an insufferable vegan and not even being vegan.

Some people don't make it their entire personality.", "Okay I think it's also funny that with some vegans that have this pious attitude  about their health and care for the environment will also be at festivals with  doing a lot of  illicit substances and smoke/drink heavy.", "This sometimes people are friends or really want approval to putthemselves in compromising situations like vegan at the dinner table.", "no, actually i think sheila is psychotic in her own way for being so incredibly judgmental about how people nourish their bodies lol.", "To be fair, Micheala spent months lying to the poor woman. If Sheila had been told for months the house was vegan because of Sheila and came over only to have animal products shoves in her face I can see why she'd respond that way - from her perspective this must have seemed like a cruel prank.", "Gee, I can't imagine why someone who was lied to for months might be judgmental when the lies start coming out. /S", "You\u2019re vegetarian. If you were actually serious about animal rights and took the time to research, you\u2019d be vegan. I was vegetarian for 8 years before becoming vegan about 5 years ago. \n\nI linked the video above of what happens to male baby chicks in the egg industry. That alone, if appropriately processed, is enough reasons for you to stop eating eggs. Search up, \u201cDairy is Scary\u201d on YouTube, it\u2019s about 5 minutes and goes into what\u2019s involved in the dairy industry. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t see vegetarian animal rights activists, and animal rights activists are vegan. A small amount of research into the dairy and egg industry is enough to make one be vegan.", "She's right and non-vegans are too caught up in their own cognitive dissonance to even acknowledge it so you have to insult her instead", "Whoopsie. I may have read too fast and missed that part. But yeah, that sounds toxic as hell.", "pretty sure they're more talking about white lies, like telling your mom you love the birthday present she got for you, even though you hate it.\n\nthen there are big lies, like claiming to be monogamous to your partner when you're cheating on them.\n\nOne doesn't cause harm, in fact is actively trying to avoid harm, the other has a clear victim and illicit gain for the person lying.\n\nIt's all well and good in theory to say that lies are lies, but there are different types of lies. Someone who says they never tell lies means they also say to a five year old child \"thank you for the drawing, however it's incredibly badly done so I'm gonna throw it out\" It sounds really noble to be someone who thinks lies are lies and always tells the truth, but the reality is that person is a huge asshole and there's nothing noble or commendable about it.", "Pointing out that someone said something insulting is not the same as insulting that person yourself. \n\nI give vegans all the credit in the world for their discipline, not that I should have to say that, because I never insulted anyone.", "Dude, plants are not \"sentient\" in the same way as animals. Sentience refers to perceiving or feeling things. Plants can perceive chemically changes in their environment and react. Animals can feel pain, fear, and also joy and excitement. Tomatoes do not scream, they emit chemical gasses when plucked from the stem. Plants do not have a central nervous system or pain receptors. In fact, they want to be eaten because that's often how they spread their seed. Are you seriously telling me that you see no difference between stabbing a watermelon and stabbing a lamb?\n\nWhew, you think you just made an invincible argument, but it has literally been rebutted so many times because you are playing with the definition of sentience in order to say that the sentience of a plant is the same sentience that an animal or human experiences. It's not the same. This is a zombie argument that never dies.\n\nIn conclusion: Carrots cannot feel pain. Cherries don't scream or cry. Lettuce doesn't feel fear. If you are trying to say they do, you are actually deluded.\n\nBtw, when news articles make up catchy headlines like \"trees talk to one another\" and \"tomatoes scream when you pick them\" - they are not actually meaning this literally, they're trying to come up with a clickbait title so people like you can cherry-pick the argument for your next debate on ethical food choices. If you put an apple and a rabbit in front of a child, which will they try to eat and which will they pet and play with? Even a child can tell the difference between a plant and an animal.", "You are doing something immoral by eating animal bodyparts. Eating animal bodyparts = participating and financially funding the number 1 cause of preventable animal abuse done by humans. \n\nIf dogfighting is wrong or punching a cat in the face for fun is immoral, so is eating animal bodyparts.", "wait... /s ?", "Both Michaela and Shelia was in the wrong. Michaela for pretending to be vegan and Sheila for being rude about OP's food. Being surprised that there is diary products is understandable but not to the point of insulting your hosts food. Its bad manners and uncalled for.", "Domestic sheep only need sheering because they've been selectively bred to need it- I'm not vegan (or vegetarian) but it's a might bit unethical to specifically breed an animal with traits detrimental to it's health and then use said traits as an excuse to exploit it.", "I agree with you! I've been looking for comments where someone could explain to me how Sheila insulted them. By simply acknowledging there was a lot of meat on the menu? She literally thought Michaela was a vegan! If she knew she was the only vegan, she wouldn't have said anything probably. The only \"evidence\" that Sheila insulted OP was OP saying they were insulted. That is not evidence. In my comment, I said if they were offended by Sheila's comment, that's fair, but she thought she was in the company of another vegan and was just trying to connect with Michaela. Anyone have any idea what actual insult was spoken? I doubt there was one.", "No, their logic is that if an animal can't consent to you taking something from it you can't take it.", ">It's genuinely lost on me how a person can get upset over their friend eating an egg\n\nIs it though? You threw your girlfriend under the bus for eating an egg just because you don't like the person she was talking to. Clearly her claiming her *not* eating an egg disturbed you just as much.\n\nYTA you should have stayed out of it. There's a million ways of saying \"the world doesn't revolve around your food preferences\" without saying \"hey even my girlfriend isn't a vegan like you\" and as a result just cost your girlfriend a relationship she cared about (why she cares if beyond me, Sheila sounds exhausting af but that's neither here nor there)", "NTA. Dump the lying wench. Red flags everywhere.", "NTA, but for everyone else, ESH.  Both Sheila with her attitude and Michaela with her lying, your behavior was fine.  Rude to some extent, but fine.  Based on Sheila's subsequent behavior I can understand why Michaela lied to Sheila, but why she would want to be friends with her is beyond me.", "NTA I have two sisters in laws who are \u201cvegetarian\u201d that both eat meat. Virtue signaling is annoying, lying about it is just gross.", "NTA-  But you might want to check this link.   \n[https://psychcentral.com/blog/psychology-self/2019/07/narcissist-pretending#1](https://psychcentral.com/blog/psychology-self/2019/07/narcissist-pretending#1)  \n\n\nYou sure you want to be stuck with this?  \nShe blindsided your friend who was looking forward to a vegan meal and knee jerk reacted to meat products instead. Yes, rude, but understandable. Your GF set you both up to be unhappy. A real piece of work.", "NTA. I'm vegan and most of my friends are not. Unless Sheila is some kind of militant, I'd suspect it was all the lying your girlfriend did, for seemingly no reason other than to be perceived as \"cool\", that has Sheila weirded out. I probably wouldn't be friends with someone whose boyfriend had to out them for eating an omelet because why are you lying to me about eating an omelet? lol", "This Sheila person was told the \u201cyou must be fun at parties\u201d and doubled down to be literally the worst house guest. You\u2019re still sorta TA for doing that in front of people, it should\u2019ve been in private.", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying ESH. Sheila is an ah for demeaning your food. Your girlfriend is an ah for lying. But you\u2019re an ah for not talking to your girlfriend and giving her some understanding before embarrassing her. I get wanting to call her out, but she\u2019s your girlfriend and she needs to know you\u2019re on her side. The calling out should have been private. I am glad to hear you apologized and talked it through after the fact.", "There is still something that she's not telling you. Why is it so important for her to have a friend that would care what she eats? Is this girl that petty? Why does she want to impress her? It doesn't make sense", "NTA; Your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have been lying and going out of her way to pretend to be somebody that she wasn\u2019t. You shouldn\u2019t have to cover for lies like that, especially when someone is being insulting to you.", "Yes they both suck, but not meat", "I wonder if she was \"insulting\" the food, or just commenting on it because she was surprised that a supposed vegan would have animal products at an event they're hosting.\n\nI am vegan, most of my friends are not. If a non vegan friend hosted a dinner, I wouldn't question what they served. But if a vegan friend hosts something, I usually feel relieved-\"yay! I don't have to question ingredients here!\" So Sheila shows up, sees the spread, and asks what's up.\n\nOf course Sheila could've been totally rude and maybe was insulting, I wasn't there. But maybe she was just disappointed because she thought she was attending an event where she didn't have to worry about the menu, then shows up and every dish has milk or cheese.", "My question is, did they invite their VEGAN friend over and not have vegan food? Like what prompted the comments?", "Yes! OPs gf is probably the only vegan/vegetarian in their friend group and wanted a friend that shared her experience.", "I know about the dairy and egg industry and what's going on there is disgusting. I don't eat eggs, I don't eat much dairy. So no, knowing about the industry is not enough to automatically make someone 100% vegan. People are unable or unwilling to be (fully) vegan for various reasons. It's important you make an effort, not restrict yourself in ways that make you lose quality of life. If for you that means a 100% vegan lifestyle, good for you. But you should be encouraging people who are at least doing *something*, even if they're not going all the way, instead of lecturing them that they're not doing enough. Your comments are alienating people who would otherwise be sympathetic to your cause. I lectured my family about their lifestyle and expressed my disgust about meat during dinner when I was a teenager and I didn't change a single mind that way. I now recognise that behaviour was incredibly rude and me just living my life made others reconsider what they eat *on their own*. The world isn't black and white, I hope one day you'll see that too.", "or...you could just stop with a simple 'thank you for drawing me a picture' without throwing in your opinion of its quality or your plans on what to do with it in the future.  There is a difference between being honest and being cruel.   You don't \\*have\\* to add commentary to every statement.\n\nWhite lies are still lies, regardless of the intent of the liar.", "Yes it\u2019s absolutely shitty of the GF to do that no doubt in my mind. However whether the GF was actually vegan or not doesn\u2019t change the fact she directly insulted OP who had absolutely nothing to do with the situation.", "What was the direct insult to OP?", "By that logic honey should be vegan because bees can leave and will do so if they're being mistreated and think they'll do better in the wild, but the formal definition is still no animal products whatsoever."]}
