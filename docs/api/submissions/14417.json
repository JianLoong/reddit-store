For as long as I've known her, she's been a strict vegetarian: no meat at all; if we go to a restaurant and there's complimentary soup, she doesn't hesitate to flat out ask if there are meat products in the broth.\n\nBack in December, she met someone new where she works, a younger girl by the name of Sheila. Sheila is a vegan, and doesn't even want to be around a place where cheese might exist. She's been chatting with my girlfriend, Michaela, frequently, and Michaela apparently has been telling Sheila and their other workmates that Michaela is a vegan. She's gone so far as to put on Facebook ridiculous posts such as, \"loving my vegan lifestyle!\" \"Salads for lunch, being a vegan is great!\"\n\nThe whole time she's making these comments, I'll see her eating cheese, drinking milk, etc. She's still keeping with her vegetarian diet, but is definitely not a vegan by any stretch of the term.\n\nI've pretty much tried to ignore it even though it's been a little annoying hearing her talk about it, but I snapped yesterday at our Easter dinner, which Michaela insisted be held at our home. Michaela invited Sheila (who I honestly didn't like, because when she was looking at the dinner spread, she made comments about Michaela putting up with so many animal products), and I'd had enough.\n\nSo when Michaela and Sheila struck up a conversation in which Sheila proceeded to insult our food once again, I interrupted, saying that, \"it really isn't a problem for Michaela, given that she's not a vegan. In fact, I watched her eat an omelet just this morning.\"\n\nMichaela began to deny it and claim that I was lying, but Sheila looked a little upset that Michaela had been \"bullshitting her\". (It's genuinely lost on me how a person can get upset over their friend eating an egg, but then again, I am not on a diet.) Long story short, Sheila is mad at Michaela for faking veganism for months, and now Michaela is upset with me because I \"should have kept my mouth shut\".\n\nAITA for calling out my girlfriend on not being a vegan?", "created_utc": 1681096355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h5a7u/aita_for_calling_my_gf_out_on_not_being_a_vegan/", "score": 964, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will spare most of the gore, and just go to this one practice of culling all baby male chicks in the egg industry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_u0jxi_v-w&t=1s\n\nThe above practice is why I became vegan, instead of vegetarian. \n\nThere are lots of merits with regards to being vegan, and there are legitimate criticisms of people eating animal bodyparts and animal secretions, including eggs. I don't think Sheila is the asshole at all, for coming over and being critical of animal products both you and your gf consume. Also, if someone doesn't know about the animal abuse in animal agriculture or hasn't seriously thought it through, it's hard to believe they are the asshole for not being vegan - that said, I would say eating animal bodyparts as opposed to being vegetarian does make pretty much everyone the asshole, since animal bodypart being abusive is fairly obvious, unlike egg, dairy, or honey. So I do think you are the asshole for not being vegetarian like your gf, and I think your gf is the asshole for lying about being vegan (could just be honest with Sheila and say she's vegetarian but would really like to be vegan).", "NTA, but you're a snitch.

At that point, the food is already prepared anyway and you'll just ruin the mood. If you truly believe everyone who eats meat is automatically an asshole, then you should not associate with meat-eaters. Nobody forced Sheila to come to the Easter dinner. You don't have to be friends with anyone who isn't vegan. You can discuss ethics and tell people about your opinions when they ask you or it comes up in a conversation naturally or it is someone very close and you know they just never thought about it before and are gentle about it, but you won't convince anyone what they're doing is wrong by shaming and insulting them. It's already a great step when some reduces the amount of meat they eat, it's not easy for everyone to just stop. Everyone who thinks that it's okay to come to someone else's house and lecture them, is an entitled asshole. \n\nSeveral friends back in high school became vegetarian some time after I did. One friend even got her entire family to be more conscious of what they eat. Another friend always struggled with food intolerances and is just happy when she *can* eat something. I never lectured or insulted any of them, those who changed their minds did so at their own pace.

It's just hard to judge from a scenario in which someone has been actively lying to her for literal months.", "That's literally what they just said.

If you take some time to seriously think it through instead of lashing out, you'd realize what I'm saying is obviously correct. \n\nAs far as \"free range eggs\" goes, the above video I linked of male baby chicks being dumped into a macerator is from a \"free range\" egg farm. Vegans aren't idiots, I didn't mention anything about how chickens are in cages, so \"free range\" doesn't really resolve the issue I just mentioned.
