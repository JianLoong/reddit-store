For as long as I've known her, she's been a strict vegetarian: no meat at all; if we go to a restaurant and there's complimentary soup, she doesn't hesitate to flat out ask if there are meat products in the broth.\n\nBack in December, she met someone new where she works, a younger girl by the name of Sheila. Sheila is a vegan, and doesn't even want to be around a place where cheese might exist. She's been chatting with my girlfriend, Michaela, frequently, and Michaela apparently has been telling Sheila and their other workmates that Michaela is a vegan. She's gone so far as to put on Facebook ridiculous posts such as, \"loving my vegan lifestyle!\" \"Salads for lunch, being a vegan is great!\"\n\nThe whole time she's making these comments, I'll see her eating cheese, drinking milk, etc. She's still keeping with her vegetarian diet, but is definitely not a vegan by any stretch of the term.\n\nI've pretty much tried to ignore it even though it's been a little annoying hearing her talk about it, but I snapped yesterday at our Easter dinner, which Michaela insisted be held at our home. Michaela invited Sheila (who I honestly didn't like, because when she was looking at the dinner spread, she made comments about Michaela putting up with so many animal products), and I'd had enough.\n\nSo when Michaela and Sheila struck up a conversation in which Sheila proceeded to insult our food once again, I interrupted, saying that, \"it really isn't a problem for Michaela, given that she's not a vegan. In fact, I watched her eat an omelet just this morning.\"\n\nMichaela began to deny it and claim that I was lying, but Sheila looked a little upset that Michaela had been \"bullshitting her\". (It's genuinely lost on me how a person can get upset over their friend eating an egg, but then again, I am not on a diet.) Long story short, Sheila is mad at Michaela for faking veganism for months, and now Michaela is upset with me because I \"should have kept my mouth shut\".\n\nAITA for calling out my girlfriend on not being a vegan?\n\n\n**Brief update:** I talked to Michaela today and asked her what was going on and why she felt the need to lie about it. I told her I was sorry for upsetting her and causing an uncomfortable situation between her and a friend, and she told me that she genuinely liked speaking to Sheila, and while she hadn't expected her lie to get as far as it did, she wanted to gain a bond/friendship with Sheila. Apparently though, Sheila hasn't spoken to her outside of work related topics.", "created_utc": 1681096355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h5a7u/aita_for_calling_my_gf_out_on_not_being_a_vegan/", "score": 1892, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes calling people out is the only way to hold them accountable. Could you have done it better? Probably. But if she didn't want to face these consequences she shouldn't have lied.\n\nSecond, I am vegan, I'd like to shed some light here on why vegans are upset about animal products, including eggs. \n\nAnimals are harmed for these products. When humans choose to consume eggs, meat, dairy, etc. you're paying for another sentient being to be abused, objectified, and killed at a fraction of their natural lifespan against their will. This is upsetting because in the modern world humans don't need to do these things, but continue to do so because we're way too good at compartmentalizing the harm we cause others, especially when it isn't happening in front of us and because historically humans have viewed animals as robots and totally disregarded that they are also sentient beings that experience emotion and thought, and value their own lives. \n\nFor eggs specifically, there's a lot of problems. First you have the part where in hatcheries, on the first day of new chicks lives male chicks are separated out from the rest because they won't be able to lay eggs. Then they're usually tossed into industrial grinders en masse. Egg laying hens have had their genetics manipulated to have 30x the amount of periods that their bodies would have naturally, which takes an enormous toll on their health. These birds, before human intervention, lay around 12 - 30 eggs per year. Now they lay hundreds. So many birds die from prolapsed cloacas or other problems related to constantly producing eggs and having nutrients sapped from their bodies as a result. People also often think that these birds aren't killed which isn't true. Egg production declines after a couple years, if they survive that long due to the genetic manipulation I explained before, and then they're sent to slaughter for not being as useful. Birds used for breeding are often kept in horrid conditions as well. And terms like free range, cage free etc. don't really mean that much in terms of quality of life for these animals. The overwhelming majority are still kept in sheds hardly ever seeing the outside world. Even best case scenario, you're still benefitting from harming these animals as they all have origins in hatcheries and have their genetics manipulated to their detriment. Even homesteaders kill their chickens when they're no longer useful to them. There is absolutely no kindness in this no matter how you approach it.\n\nI am vegan because I think it is wrong to harm other sentient beings when I have the option not to do that. Using other sentient beings for food, entertainment, etc. when I can just not do that is in direct conflict with the values I say I have. So it seems the only logical course of action is being vegan. It isn't just a food choice - it's a value I hold that affects the food choices I make. I could care less what people eat if no one is intentionally harming others, but that's not the case with animal products at all in the modern world. Of course it bothers me that others choose to harm animals when they have the option not to do so, and if I or others like me never speak up for those being harmed, nothing will ever change. We are choosing to live in a world where we harm others even though we've reached a point in our development where we no longer need to do this and understand that we wouldn't want it done to us. It doesn't have to be that way.\n\n\nIt is especially frustrating because most people will say they don't want to harm animals, but then go on to do things that harm animals even though they can just choose to consume/do something else. So saying that is meaningless if your actions don't reflect it. And it is upsetting, knowing how much avoidable suffering humans are creating via their consumption choices, and knowing it doesn't have to be that way. Especially for someone like me who volunteers nearly full time (on top of my actual full time job) in animal rescue for farmed animals. I see the abuse/neglect/death/suffering so often and I know that the inconveniences humans may incur going vegan are just.... so infinitesimal compared to the pain being created so humans can enjoy the taste of someone else's body or secretions. Of course I want to do something about it.", "Imagine being an insufferable vegan and not even being vegan.
