For as long as I've known her, she's been a strict vegetarian: no meat at all; if we go to a restaurant and there's complimentary soup, she doesn't hesitate to flat out ask if there are meat products in the broth.\n\nBack in December, she met someone new where she works, a younger girl by the name of Sheila. Sheila is a vegan, and doesn't even want to be around a place where cheese might exist. She's been chatting with my girlfriend, Michaela, frequently, and Michaela apparently has been telling Sheila and their other workmates that Michaela is a vegan. She's gone so far as to put on Facebook ridiculous posts such as, \"loving my vegan lifestyle!\" \"Salads for lunch, being a vegan is great!\"\n\nThe whole time she's making these comments, I'll see her eating cheese, drinking milk, etc. She's still keeping with her vegetarian diet, but is definitely not a vegan by any stretch of the term.\n\nI've pretty much tried to ignore it even though it's been a little annoying hearing her talk about it, but I snapped yesterday at our Easter dinner, which Michaela insisted be held at our home. Michaela invited Sheila (who I honestly didn't like, because when she was looking at the dinner spread, she made comments about Michaela putting up with so many animal products), and I'd had enough.\n\nSo when Michaela and Sheila struck up a conversation in which Sheila proceeded to insult our food once again, I interrupted, saying that, \"it really isn't a problem for Michaela, given that she's not a vegan. In fact, I watched her eat an omelet just this morning.\"\n\nMichaela began to deny it and claim that I was lying, but Sheila looked a little upset that Michaela had been \"bullshitting her\". (It's genuinely lost on me how a person can get upset over their friend eating an egg, but then again, I am not on a diet.) Long story short, Sheila is mad at Michaela for faking veganism for months, and now Michaela is upset with me because I \"should have kept my mouth shut\".\n\nAITA for calling out my girlfriend on not being a vegan?", "created_utc": 1681096355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h5a7u/aita_for_calling_my_gf_out_on_not_being_a_vegan/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That being said, OP, you may still be getting \"stitches\".

Your gf was lying to look cool for a new friend and that person was insufferable", "ESH - you should've handled that better. Calling her out on her immature actions in front of someone is your own immature action here. There were plenty of opportunities to have that discussion in private but you chose the dramatic route. But, your gf actions were more of a red flag. Going as far as posting on social and lying to someone so intently is concerning. It was at bare minimum it was immature and at worst, more malicious. Either way, how did she think she wouldn't have been called out on that? Of course someone was going to say something! It's worth having a bigger conversation with her about why she would do that in the first place.", "Sounds like she didn't understand the difference.
