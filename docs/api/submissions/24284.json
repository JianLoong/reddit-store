I'm probably going to see if they can ship me one in the US.", "That was the phase where I spent more money on jeans for my kids because they had reinforced knees. Gap ones did cost more, but lasted through 2 kids vs cheaper ones that my boys shredded quickly, so it was actually worth it and eventually saved me money. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case anymore for little kids as mine are teenagers now and once again outgrowing clothes before they destroy them.", "YTA.  but why did you go over the clothes together? You\u2019re giving her old clothes to pick and choose from. Her choices are her choices. She has the prerogative to be as frugal or snobby as she wants. Just give her the clothes and let her sort herself or donate it on buy nothing.\n\nYour advice (no matter how how true) was unsolicited.", "She\u2019s being idealistic. Allow her that, it won\u2019t last much longer. ESH", "Gift her the clothes at her baby shower.  It'll show everyone how shitty she is when she has a melting over them.  (But really don't, because she'll just throw them away.  Definitely give them to didn't who isn't a vile asshole who is just going to seek them anyway.)\nNTA", "Oh my, is she in for a rude awakening. Babies/toddlers grow, and poop, and pee, and vomit, and roll in who knows what. I might just choose to politely sit on the sideline for a couple of years while she figures this out. Why anyone would buy something fancy for anything other than a special occasion is beyond me.\n\nI was a 10lb baby, so I never even fit into newborn clothes. Bonus, everyone thought I was going to be a boy, so\u2026 I wore boys clothes. There are almost no \u201ccute\u201d baby photos of me. The one cute one I can think of, I was naked in a metal tub with a rubber duck.", "These are clothes that the kid will wear for a few months before it grows out of them \n\nDoes she have an unlimited source of funds that she can afford the expensive stuff?", "NTA and she's in for a rude awakening when her daughter pukes or poops all over her expensive clothes. Or when the baby grows so fast she never gets to wear the nice outfits. \n\nScrew fashion, babies and children grow ridiculously fast and you'll waste a fortune trying to keep them in name brand clothes. \n\nI have two teens and they have yet to keep any clothes longer than a few months before they've out grown them. You'd expect a 16yr old to level off so clothes will last longer, nope. I bought clothes in June and now it looks like my son is running around in denim capris. He put on a button up shirt the other day that he's only had since April and it was pulling so tight at the buttons that the button band was gaping in between each button. \n\nI pick clothes that are decent quality and either on sale or off brand. Thrifting helps too. I will splurge on shoes to a degree, but not for fashion. I'll get good shoes that are comfortable and good for their feet that they think look nice. Even then I keep an eye out for sales because it all adds up fast when we're constantly having to replace them. \n\nAll that to say that your SiL is being idiotic. She seems naive on top of being stuck up. She's not using any foresight and you'd think her mother, who raised children, would warn her that clothes won't last and will easily get ruined.", "Oh the slap life is going to give this girl will Sting. Hope she\u2019s a quick learner", "\"Nice clothes that last\"????? For a baby?? Most babies outgrow their clothes in a very short period of time. How long do the need to last? \n\nNTA", "Why does she want them to last? The baby won\u2019t be in them long enough. Also all my old clothes went to my brother then got further passed down to my cousins. It got to the point my cousins weren\u2019t interested in any clothes unless they\u2019d been handed down lol.

She\u2019ll learn.", "NTA, the gall of some people. It\u2019s a baby. The child is going to outgrow most things in months. Let her waste her money. You don\u2019t owe her an apology. And if MIL knows the full story and wants you to apologize she is ridiculous.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n>She got defensive and said that she's not wrong for wanting her daughter to have nice clothes that will last.\n\nHow long does she expect *clothes for babies* to last? Every baby outgrows clothes before the clothes have time to become deformed. Even the cheapest-quality baby clothes can last the short time the baby is small enough to fit.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, I agree that clothes should be sturdy enough to last more than a season, but suggesting the clothes are too shoddy for a baby is a ridiculous take. Also, OP *is* doing the responsible and sustainable thing by offering secondhand (in this case, pre-owned but never worn) baby clothes to someone else who'd need them instead of tossing them.", "NTA.. eww to mil getting in the middle of it. Also, baby clothes won't last because babies grow so fast\ud83d\ude02 let her go waste her own money I guess. Also, h&m baby clothes aren't cheap and they're pretty nice quality", "Nta I'd take back my offer and let her waste her money. I bet nobody can tell her babies grow fast and don't stay the same size very long.", "NTA she's got one big shock coming when she realises how much a baby costs. And please ignore the Mil. It's you who deserves an apology.", "Since when has H&M been considered cheap??!!", "NYA, I\u2019d open an account for your nephew in law and never offer anything to your sister in law again.", "Baby clothes.

Month? \n\nNTA.", "NTA - She is being stuck up, and there is nothing for you to apologize for.", "If you don't have friends, who are you inviting to the shower?", ">It is seen as a tacky gift grab.\n\nIs that not what it *literally* is, though? A baby is coming, come give presents because the parents can't afford to buy their own stuff?\n\nI don't understand this concept at all.", "This whole \"it's tacky to throw your own baby shower\" schtick needs to go. Not everyone is lucky enough to have family or friends who care enough to put in the effort.

This whole \"don't throw your own because you're begging for gifts\" is just so weird? This is not any different from like, a birthday party or even a dinner party where we say etiquette means bringing a gift for the hosts. People don't have to attend if the idea that they need to buy a gift hurts them deeply. \n\nI feel like there's some underlying bullshit about how demure and humble an expecting mom should be. Anytime something like this is hinged on politeness, it's usually something classist or sexist or whatever. There's literally no reason to have this rule other than tradition.", "Yes, but socially, it's considered less tacky if someone else suggests \"Barbara is having a baby; let's all give her some gifts to get her started!\" than it is for you to say \"Let me throw a party so all my closest friends can bring me gifts!\" (At least in the U.S. Personally I'm neutral on this one. We all know what a baby shower is for; I feel like we can drop the pretense.)", "It's not just a schtick; it's viewed as basically asking people to give you gifts.", "The \"crackling noise\" as you stretched out your shirts...that's awesome!! Your poor mother!!", "Seriously. The clothes can't be that tacky, she had to Google to find out if they were cheap or not.", "It's like some miss manners bullshit. Nothing wrong with hosting your own shower. Not everyone has people with a pile of free time to organise a party for them. Most of my immediate family lived out of state so I organised one and invited them. Didn't ask for gifts though but people still brought little things. Maybe that's the difference. Registries aren't particularly  common here so it's not as much of an expensive gift grab.", "Thank you. I\u2019m literally laughing out loud.", "Glad I can bring some joy!"]}
