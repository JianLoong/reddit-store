I mean, you could either be bigoted and insulting or flat-out calling them out for actual behavior.

Instead you completely ignore the fact that families have traditions and rituals, and when they are not passed down, that can be sad and difficult. Your \"toxic cave man\" comment was completely uncalled for. You seem to be completely self absorbed, rude, and somewhat bigoted to alternative lifestyles. You knew what you were marrying into.

It\u2019s hard on them. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t mean to blame you people say things out of anger and it isn\u2019t the reality nor do they believe that. With that said, yes you have every right to name and raise your child the English way.

I understand the desire to prevent your daughter beng harmed by a lifestyle that is problematic at best but a nightmare for girls and women. You have that authority and are utilizing it. That's great. Going nuclear on your in-laws who have no actual power whatsoever beyond a few side eyes and disappointed expressions seems excessive.

They complained that their son left their community, implied you of stole their son, and said they'd prefer a traditional name. You responded with personal insults. They aired grievances (mostly about their son), but you were unnecessarily cruel. You also immediately weaponized your child.  Unless there is more to this story, I don't think you're being honest. I grew up in a community where many Amish families lived.

I was vocal from day one that I didn't believe any of it, but was forced to follow the isolating religion for 5 years, until I made my mom's life hellish enough she finally caved and let me live with my dad. It was the month before my 14th (when I could legally choose who I lived with) so I think she knew it was coming. \n\nFast forward to me being 23, my mom calls to tell me she finally left her abusive husband after 13 years, that she wished she had listened to her 7 year old (me) about him and that she left the religion (the abusive husband introduced to our family when I was 9) because she \"was tired of being told what to believe and wanted to figure it out\" herself. I never got an apology for the years she forced me to act on what she and many others tried (unsuccessfully) telling me to believe...\n\nI went NC last year because of her repeated choice in not protecting her children (or grandchildren) from her repeat choice in an abusive man. The religious stuff is coming back as I process and grieve the loss of the mom I never had and I can tell you the memories of religious bs is just building a taller wall. Sometimes I think \"she's damaged. She's traumatized, this is multi generational C-PTSD, I can fill a page with known traumas, what about the unknown? I can let this go.\" and then I remember the religious bs that she still truly believes she had a right to (therapist confirmed she's wrong) and I think \"f that ACTIVE authoritarian tyrant.\" \n\nIf you want to maintain a relationship with your children, please always offer them realistic options for everything, especially FAITH based choices. My dad never forced anything on us children, he led by example and while I don't share his faith based choices we have a bond based on mutual respect to live individual lives, and he has a relationship with his grandchildren. My mom has neither of those things. \n\nPs: at 37, my intuition at 7 (about abusive man) and 9 (religion) was spot on and if I had to go back, the only changes I'd make is I would have fought even harder for my right of religious freedom. I knew then. Children know. The years of persistent gaslighting from her and elders caused me to lose trust in my intuition for a long time.
