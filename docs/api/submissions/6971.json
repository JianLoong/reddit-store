Instead you completely ignore the fact that families have traditions and rituals, and when they are not passed down, that can be sad and difficult. Your \"toxic cave man\" comment was completely uncalled for. You seem to be completely self absorbed, rude, and somewhat bigoted to alternative lifestyles. You knew what you were marrying into.

He may still be processing his feelings about his childhood and may struggle to express himself with someone he sees as an authority, but as a partner and now a father, he needs to be ready to step up in solidarity with his family-by-choice.\n\nThat said, if you and he both feel absolutely fine about how this played out: if he prefers to let you play the \"bad guy\" and you feel fine doing so, then no harm done. I'm all for cutting toxic people out of your life, whether they are blood-related or not.", "ESH. I understand the desire to prevent your daughter beng harmed by a lifestyle that is problematic at best but a nightmare for girls and women. You have that authority and are utilizing it. That's great. Going nuclear on your in-laws who have no actual power whatsoever beyond a few side eyes and disappointed expressions seems excessive.

They complained that their son left their community, implied you of stole their son, and said they'd prefer a traditional name. You responded with personal insults. They aired grievances (mostly about their son), but you were unnecessarily cruel. You also immediately weaponized your child.  Unless there is more to this story, I don't think you're being honest.

It was the month before my 14th (when I could legally choose who I lived with) so I think she knew it was coming. \n\nFast forward to me being 23, my mom calls to tell me she finally left her abusive husband, that she wished she had listened to her 7 year old (me) about him and that she left the religion (the abusive husband introduced to our family when I was 9) because she \"was tired of being told what to believe and wanted to figure it out\" herself.

Sometimes I think she's damaged. She's traumatized, this is multi generational C-PTSD, I can fill a page with known traumas, what about the unknown? I can let this go. Then I remember the religious bs that she still truly believes she had a right to (therapist confirmed she's wrong) and I think f that ACTIVE authoritarian tyrant. \n\nIf you want to maintain a relationship with your children, please always offer them realistic options for everything, especially faith based choices. My dad never forced anything on us children, he led by example and while I don't share his faith based choices we have a bond based on mutual respect to live individual lives and he has a relationship with his grandchildren. My mom has neither of those things. \n\nMy intuition at 7 (about abusive man), 9 (religion) and 35 (physical harassment from mom's current abusive husband that led to therapy) was spot on and if I had to go back, the only changes I'd make is I would fight even harder for my right to religious freedom. I knew then. Children know. The years of persistent gaslighting from her and many others caused me to lose trust in my intuition for a long time.

They keep them uneducated, weak, limit their options and resources and bind them to the culture. \n\nTheir way of life appears quaint and wholesome, in reality it is oppression and their beliefs are not sincerely held. They conform their exceptions to what helps keep the Men and church elders in control or is convenient. \n\nDomineering hypocrites.

That doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t doing her best. The lesser of two evils can be used to describe just that, seeing as OP clearly is too close to the forest to see the trees.", "I seeeeee! Okie doke!", "Nope. Was just curious. Not trying to argue.", "I feel like it isn't compatible with most forms of Christianity. If you sincerely believe in a religion where not believing in it results in eternal torture, I don't see how you could possibly justify not giving your child every chance possible to avoid that fate.", "Yes - so that those who are baptized can understand the faith and can choose to accept it or not.", "Yes. Young people are given an opportunity to go out and experience the modern world to decide if they want to remain in the community or not. If they return, they are baptized and resume living within the established rules.", "I will not pretend to not be biased against abusive cults, thanks.", "People can control their behavior, exactly.  So OP's in-laws should control their behavior and STFU with their criticism about OP's and husband's choices regarding *their* child, while in-laws are guests in *their* home.", "But that's on the individual level. We're comparing them to a religion that actively advocates shunning people who leave the community.", "goddamnit", "The Dycks are Mennonite, that's different. Amish and Mennonite are like the difference between Hasids and Orthodox Jews. Like the Orthodox and Mennonite dress and have customs a little different from where they're living, but the Amish and Hasids are straight up enclaves with little connection to the public services and laws of the area. \n\nPeople who dont know any think Amish are all cute and wholesome because of how they dress and their lack of electricity, but the Pennsylvania Dutch Amish enclave (the largest in the world and the one I interact with) are awful. Incestuous rape, child abuse, animal cruelty especially puppy mill breeding, medical neglect, domestic violence are all common enough and almost never caught by Lancaster police because Amish close ranks and don't talk to English police unless they have to, and their kids don't usually go to public school and are taught by women with 8th grade educations from the same 1 room schoolhouse they had attended. There's a Law and Order episode that addresses these problems in Hasidic Brooklyn and if you substituted corn for skyscrapers and Pennsylvania Dutch for Yiddish you could do the same exact episode in Lancaster.", "Ill check that out", "Their son left the lifestyle for something different. The op doesn't follow that lifestyle.  I would say it's disrespect to push your beliefs in a house onto people that don't align with them. They had their chance to raise a child.  Who is to say the child doesn't have the fathers last name? Once someone is irritated with the convo and you continue, it's disrespectful. The way their acting could be the reason the son left them to begin with.", "Definitely", "I think Global Methodist Churches are mostly in the southern U.S., so if you're not in one of those locales the chances of finding a Global Methodist Church might be slim.", "These are people that will be in her life for her entire marriage and maybe longer (assuming they stay in contact.). They need to learn to respect boundaries and not insult one another. One way to do that is by gaining a better understanding of the others\u2019 background. I didn\u2019t say accept, agree, or acquiesce to demands. But they might be able to find common ground on at least some topics.", "As a former Amish female, strong agreement on the classification as a cult. I\u2019m actually pleasantly surprised by the number of people calling it out though. Almost every conversation about the Amish is full of people who see them as cute, folksy, salt of the earth. It\u2019s infuriating.", "This sentence is literally the definition of bias lol. Have a good day my man", "Eh, that massively depends.   Teenagers who leave before there baptism?  Often nbd.  Older adults it's more varied.   Depends on the sect.   There isn't one Amish church.   Different bishops and communities have different standards \n\nSource: my granny lives surrounded by relatively chill Amish.", "Yes, I was joking, but also with the child sex abuse that's rampant in the Catholic Church and my aunt's experience being shunned and excommunicated when she got divorced, I'm not sure that they're all that different.", "Because people mistake the various types of Amish and put them in one group. Yes to outsiders, they are quaint, back to nature, kinda cute folks. Most people don't look any deeper.\n\nMost people think of Amish people like the ones in the movie Witness (with Harrison Ford).", "Because America has a tolerance for cults with how far our freedom of religion goes. There is a reason Mormonism and Scientology thrive here"]}
