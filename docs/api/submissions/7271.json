Your husband has no right to accuse you of abandoning his daughter when he's admittedly neglecting her. The fact that things are going better with him out of the house proves that he's the problem--not Sophie, not you, not the baby. \n\nAt 13, Sophie is most likely acting out because she wants parental attention.  Good on you for handling the situation and providing what she needs, even though it's difficult. Is there a way you can get her more excited about the new sibling? Consult her about names or decorating the nursery, etc.? It would probably do a lot to put her at ease about her future place in the family.", "I think you need family counseling. Your husband definitely needs therapy. His absenteeism is going to push you to get a divorce, and then he'll be a single father with another child he only gets to see when the court allows.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your husband certainly is. Depression isn't an excuse for shit parenting. I will say, though, that I've *been* Sophie in a way and expressed the same \"you'll forget me\" type of lashing out at my dad (stepdad but... dad) when I was a teen. That kid loves you, and is terrified you're going to leave her, or love her less when the baby is born. All things aside, reassure her -- you don't have to play \"mom\" if you don't want to, but please reassure her of your feelings for her.", "This is a severe, complicated relationship problem and way beyond AITA judgments.\n\nYou guys all need counseling.", "NTA. If he is depressed he needs to get help for it. You are not the only parent here and he should be contributing and not leaving everything to you to deal with.\n\nAlso, she is acting out for a reason. Please reach out to her and talk to her. She needs to feel loved by BOTH of you. You are both supposed to be a team here.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is a huge, irresponsible AH and should seek therapy as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, you should re-consider this \"marriage\".\n\nHe left and the situation improved \u2014 doesn\u2019t that say it all? He\u2018s the problem.", "NTA\n\nYou have a husband problem not a sophie problem.", "NTA he abandoned his daughter instead of seeking treatment and helping her. He is playing the victim instead of parenting. His own mother should have sent him home to look after his daughter. She needs therapy if she isn\u2019t already. Don\u2019t abandon Sophie but recognize that you\u2019re about to be a single parent of two. It sounds like despite her living grandparents and father you are the only one who cares enough to do the heavy duty parenting.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think the original setup will work now. You\u2019ve been her mother for so long. If you stop reprimanding her she\u2019ll think you don\u2019t care about her. It\u2019s clear she is comfortable enough with you to realise that you\u2019re the one who tells her off, and kids aren\u2019t stupid, they know the nagging parent wants what\u2019s best for them, sometimes even more than the non nagging parent. \n\nI think you\u2019re doing well with her, you just need to be supported in taking care of her and balancing the criticism with love and praise. \n\nTo do this you need time and energy. Ie husband needs to get his shit in gear. \n\nWhen you have a child you accept that you need to parent them through thick and thin. Depression is not an excuse to be an absent father. He brought this child into the world, he needs to take responsibility instead of palming it all off on you. Your health matters too. His stress might manifest as depression, but what if in five years yours manifests as a cancer?\n\nHe needs to step the fuck up and stop making excuses.", "Counseling/therapy is needed here.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nHe doesn't get to put the burden on you and play the pity card because he's depressed. Tell him to get help (therapy) and be an adult of you're out.", "NTA.\n\nThings got better all around when he left. He's the problem, not you.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s made this all about his needs, while ignoring yours completely. Let alone what Sophie actually needs.\n\nHer dad.", "NTA\n\nThis is HIS daughter and you were specifically excluded from her raising.\n\nHe needs to do his own job and be the parent", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to step up and parent and get help for his depression. She lost her mother and now she\u2019s losing her father. On top of normal new sibling coming feelings.\n\nYes part of parenting is discipline when needed but in this situation her dad needs to do more.", "I mean NTA but what do you expect? You married a dude with a kid. And Mom is gone now. \n\nI know depression is rough, but if it\u2019s so bad he can\u2019t even parent his child, why did he not have one but is working on a second kid? People like that don\u2019t make sense to me. I suffer from mental illness and have some substance use issues, I\u2019d never have a child (I\u2019m not saying no mental illness people should have kids, I just know my limits and a kid is not something I can handle. I\u2019d probably snap after hours of screaming and end up giving the baby SBS during a panic attack)\n\nI\u2019ve always said I\u2019d never marry a dude with kids for your exact situation. Yeah for now the kid may be at Moms all but everyone other weekend but people aren\u2019t immortal, they die. And the last thing I\u2019d ever want is to have to parent a child. \n\nSo while I don\u2019t think  your an asshole. I do think it was dumb to marry a dude with a kid when you had \u201cno intention\u201d of parenting her.\n\nI still went with NTA since even though you don\u2019t want to do it, you are while your husband does next to nothing due to his \u201cdepression.\u201d", "NTA. He wants you to be the bad guy, not a mother to her.", "Have you considered sitting down with Sophie and talking to her about this? Ask her what roles would be good but let her know an adult cares and is watching. Ask her about therapy. She is old enough to understand her fathers depression and that she is not responsible for it. It doesn't have to be done all at once either. Sometimes when kids act out is when they need the biggest hug. Best wishes, OP. NTA", "ESH. More dad than you though. Sounds like dad has completed checked out. I understand he's struggling but so is Sophie and she needs parental figures in her life now more than ever. Instead of having a discussion with your husband, you instead declared that you'll no longer take care of her. Going back to your original plan when things have considerably changed is nonsensical. The one suffering the most here is Sophie because she apparently has no one she can turn to or rely on. Dad needs to step it up but so do you.", "NAH. You didn't sign up to be a mom, and that was all well and good when she had an actual mother. You can explain the negotiated terms of your step parentage to a reddit lawyer but explaining to an orphaned 10-year old that you never signed up to be her mommy is a losing battle.\n\nTalk to a therapist, this is too much for random internet strangers.", "Therapy for Sophie, therapy for Dad, therapy for your new role.  AND \n\nThe book, Parenting with Love and Logic , (also spoken & videos) has made a world of difference in the way my husband and I discipline, and our kid is much happier because of it.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to pick that one specifically, but, while you\u2019re pregnant, find a book with a consistent discipline technique that can be utilized to make everyone\u2019s life easier. (Including baby). \n\nSend him a book, & you read a copy, but the two of you need to get together and agree on a discipline strategy for both girls, so that you 2 function as a team.\n\nGiving your husband something to focus on, like a book on discipline, can help focus him to begin to snap him out of the depression.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nPs.. I\u2019m not trying to make light of the situation, or the fact that he left to his mother and things are easier for you and Sophie right now.", "NTA he needs to get his shit together maybe you should separate to see if it gets better he will also know you mean business or not", "NTA but you and him both need to talk and get on the same page. You all need family counseling and your husband and stepdaughter need individual counseling like yesterday and he needs to address the depression if he isn\u2019t with his doctor! Depression sucks! but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets to slack as a parent and put it all on you, especially being pregnant and overwhelmed!", "NTA. if you hadnt changed your original parenting agreement after the death of sophie's mother the husband/dad should be stepping up. \n\nhe isnt stepping up and obviously he needs to seek a mental health professional because he is not pulling his weight at all as at adult and the parent. \n\ntell him to adult up. be the parent in the relationship and get some help mentally. he's failing as a father.", "Almost ESH, not the kid obviously. You chose to be in a relationship with a person who has a child. You've been in that child's life since before she was even forming memories. \n\nShe's behaving like a typical angsty tween. She isn't a terrible kid, especially when considering the trauma of losing her mother. \n\nClearly, your dude isn't doing enough which needs to be addressed. But this kid needs YOU. Be there for her.", "ESH except for Sophie.\n\nYou got into a marriage with a man with a daughter. You made the agreement that you wouldn't \"play mother\" back when Sophie's mother was alive. Now she isn't. As her father's wife, you inherit some degree of responsibility for your stepdaughter. I know it may not be what you want, but it isn't fair to your husband, and especially not fair to Sophie, for this all to be placed on his shoulders. Married men should not have to function as single dads.\n\nHer behavioral problems are almost certainly linked to residual trauma from losing her mother. She's acting out. Losing a loved parent is one of the worst things that can happen to a child. She's 10. That's one of the worst ages for this to happen, because she's old enough to understand the finality of death, but not old enough to have the emotional faculties to process the loss. She needs therapy, two loving parents, and patience. Your husband also needs help for his depression; he's probably overwhelmed.\n\nI'd also add that you've been in Sophie's life since she was a toddler. Regardless of your agreement, she likely already sees you as a mother figure. She's already lost her mother. She is probably looking to you for comfort.\n\nLike it or not, unless you divorce your husband, the three of you are a family. As a married couple, you and your husband share responsibilities. That includes responsibilities that may not have been foreseen at the beginning of the marriage. It's time to step up. These problems will only worsen if you treat your child differently from Sophie. She will feel even more unloved and unwanted (rightly so), and the situation will only get worse.\n\nWell wishes and best of luck to you.", "YTA for staying with this man, he left to his mothers and didn't even take his daughter you better pack up her stuff sn drop her off with your husband", "ESH you are her only mother now, try and act like it. Your husband sucks as he is her actual parent and most of the discipline should come from him. He is raising her to not like you by doing this.\n\nTell your husband to grow up and be a parent. He is too old to go running home to mummy.", "NTA", "Your husband is the biggest butt hole for not getting more involved and completely leaning on you in every facet of his life. That being said YTA for giving up on Sophie, she needs you.", "YTA a little, but not majorly - Kids going through trauma like this often act out and I think she's afraid of losing you, too. I know you don't want to, but you really do need to keep with it as far as she's concerned. I think you're probably tired and feeling exasperated from everything and your husband isn't helping because he's going through his own grief. I think the best thing you can do is embrace Sophie and reassure her you're not going anywhere. Get her into counseling as quickly as you can.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe go get your nails done together or have brunch?", "\u201cPer se\u201d means \u201cintrinsically\u201d.  An 11 yr gap where the younger partner is 21 is not grooming, but it is definitely unequal and imbalanced.  A 30-something does NOT generally feel attraction to a 20-something because they are at different stages of maturity.  This is facts.  If you think facts are rude, I can\u2019t help you with that.\n\nAnd it sounds like this 30-something was DEFINITELY seeking it a younger partner in order to use them, so whatever YOUR experience is, THIS case is something else again."]}
