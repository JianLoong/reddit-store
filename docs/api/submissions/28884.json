Ive seen photos of jessica rabbit and she's not exactly what i was watching when I was under 10 yrs old. Her dress is open on the sides op could see her underwear, kinda revealing.\n\nShowing up to \"try and make him look at her extra long\" im assuming to illicate some kind of sex drive with the ops family around is creepy. Time and place.", "NTA because dressing like that around kids is embarrassing. He saved her from humiliating herself in front of his family. There\u2019s a time and a place but with kids around it\u2019s just inappropriate. If other adults are dressing like that it\u2019s fine but when everyone is dressed appropriately and you\u2019re not it just makes you look clueless and trashy.", "Yea I agree. She wasn't naked or actually exposing any private areas. I get that it might be awkward for her to be dressed that sexily at a kid's party, and might have caused your family to see her a certain way. You have the right to express that and explain your concerns to her (would be a good idea to do so while also reassuring her that she looks great). But demanding she change or leave is going a bit too far imho. The kids would have been fine. \n\nSo I'd give this more of a KTA (or whatever the equivalent of Kinda the Asshole is)", "Agree, children don\u2019t think about anything being \u2018sexy\u2019 and I really dislike normalising the policing of what women wear or do with their bodies.", "Ever consider that kids want to go trick-or-treating on Halloween and OP and others might have other events they might want to go to that day?", "So if she showed up in a \"bikini\" with a thong and \"top\" that only barely covered her nipples, you'd still say that's an okay thing to wear to a kid-friendly party with his family?", "Jessica Rabbit is from the movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" Roger Rabbit is a cartoon rabbit.

But, yeah, fucked me up for a while. Lol", "That dip scene..... Ugh I still can't watch it!", "I watched it again the other day (for some reason that escapes me).

Think about why u were downvoted as well. It's clear that people disagree with your viewpoint", "Who Framed Roger Rabbit is rated PG or lower most countries. It\u2019s not for toddlers, but it\u2019s *absolutely* a kids movie. Like most kids movies, innuendos are for the adults and go over most kids heads.

It's rated PG where I live so no age restriction and from a quick look at IMDB that looks like the case everywhere... \n\nFamily movies were/are different than kids movies, having a few bods to more adult jokes too.

It is not for babies maybe.", "This is AITA chief.", "It's not a hard fast rule, thats not what it's about.\n\nIt's about objectively viewing data without a bias and understanding that a big complicated answer is satisfying but not always the case, and to exhaust all simply explanations before jumping to wild conclusions. \n\nOccams razor was never about assuming whether something was right, it was about priorities and putting your effort into the most likely to succeed experiments", "Except Pg-13 was introduced in 1984 and Roger Rabbit came out in 1988.

She kept her dress on sure, but it was pretty clear even as a 7 yld what the situation was. Watching bits of it as an adult it's also pretty sleazy and degrading. 2 out of 10. \n\nMy dad was fine with me watching it, but he also let me watch old boys so...", "That's because there were different standards for PG back then, lol.", "Okay so, again, literally no proof that it's the most likely explanation of any given situation, just a fancy saying to make ourselves feel smarter and deeper than we actually are .", "I had nightmares about the wicked witch as a kid too!", "That slit is high.

This is a way to prevent scientists from attempting complex experiments to acheive results when simple experiments would do the same thing with less expenses and fewer points of failure.\n\nIt is a thought process to ensure all simple methods have been attempted before attempting to explain the data through more complex experiments.\n\nFor example: I boiled my egg for 10 minutes and it was overcooked. If I ignore occams razor I might take apart my fridge to ensure it was refrigerating properly, or I might take apart my stove to make sure the temperature wasn't too high. I might test the other eggs of the batch to see if they were stored improperly. And so on and so forth.\n\nBut if I were to follow occams razor, the simplest thing is that I cooked it too long so I should cook it for 8 minutes and see if that produces a better result.\n\nIt's not about being right or wrong, it's about interpreting data without a bias and figuring out why things happen.\n\nI've seen to many cooks refuse to admit they overcooked something and they have blamed their equipment, this is a failure to follow occams razor and it has ended up being very expensive as they bought newer equipment and saw no change in results due to their bias clouding their thought process", "We don't know that's exactly the costume, but you're not seeing her legs. You're seeing pants under the dress. So it's more suggestive than revealing.", "That's a ridiculous reach. Women are free to wear ANYTHING they want.

I was SO into those books for awhile", "Definitely the second but possibly the first. \n\nI dunno, I went and found that [scene](https://youtu.be/uyUEMH1h_4o?si=hFhhstJchJx8VqeC) on YouTube, and yeah it's not quite how I remember it, but it's still cringe and pretty ick.\n\nLike I wouldn't show impressionable kids this today, not because sex = bad, but because the vibe was off. It's obviously fine and generally speaking good for people to be talking about and expressing attraction on screen where kids can see, but the whole 'woman as holding power through men finding her attractive', without any other positive strength or social roles played by woman in the film sends a screwed up message. Our media has gotten*so* much better since then, but at the time this was everywhere and all consuming. It took a lot of work to pick my self out of that head space and as a teenager I spent my time feeling like meat when ever I was in public spaces. I'm fine now, but role models mater, and the roles the people who look like you play in movies have an impact on you when you are young.", "It's not a ridiculous reach that kids should not be exposed to nudity.", "Just to clarify, \"fancy dress\" and \"fancy\" are two different terms. No one is saying it was a fancy party, so need to keep refuting what no one is arguing.", "She wasn't naked. So yeah ur reaching really hard but grasping nothing.", "Exposing her underwear and wearing a dress that nearly has her boobs falling out is very close to nudity/semi-nude. Same with the hardly-anything bikini I mentioned that you said would be especially okay. She was dressed inappropriately. Yelling that women shouldn't be policed in what they wear doesn't change the fact that there is a time and place for sexualized outfits, and a kid-friendly FAMILY party is not one of them. Women still have an obligation to ensure that they are being responsible, and she wasn't. Neither are you, for that matter."]}
