Before we had the child we agreed that she would be primarily in charge of childcare, while I would do practically everything else. This includes 95% of chores and other housework, I am the only one between the two of us that works a job(Night Shift Security Guard), I make dinner for the family, etc.   \n\n\nI want to clarify some things before I get INFO'd in the comments. When I say I do 95% of the chores, I mean that my wife will do some of the dishes like the babies bottles or cups when they need to be washed and I am asleep during the day, and occasionally fold a load of laundry that she needed a piece of clothing from before I can get around to it. I vacuum and mop the floors, do the laundry, the dishes, clean the bathrooms, cook dinner and do the grocery shopping. She takes our child to doctors appointments, wakes up with them during the night(on the days I am at work), watches them during the day, and will make baby specific meals(She will puree vegetables and fruit, and cut up smaller portions of chicken).   \n\n\nI do spend as much time as I can with our child. I wake them up in the mornings when I come home from work and feed them breakfast before I sleep. When I wake up I'll try to play with them for about 30 minutes, doing reading and playing with whatever toy they're interested in for the week. During the weekends when I am awake during the night I will be the one who gets up with our child.  \n\n\nThis is coming to a head because as we were eating dinner before I went to work, she asked if there was any way that I could watch our child more due to her feeling like she needs time for herself. At first I thought that she wanted to have more weekend events with her friends while I watch our child during the day, something I am more than okay with and have agreed with multiple times. Instead she was asking that I sleep less during the days that I work so that she can have breaks from the child during the day. I told her that I would think about it at work and I want to say no. I understand that being a SAHM is stressful because you always have to watch the baby, but she doesn't do any chores and from the way things were phrased she wouldn't be willing to take up any chores during the new break I would be giving her. I don't have much time to myself either, but I do understand that she carries the stresses of watching our child most of the time while I don't.  \n\n\nWIBTA if I told my wife that I'm not willing to let my her take a break from watching our child?", "created_utc": 1668769949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyhk4m/wibta_my_wife_wants_more_time_for_herself_when/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like to go out and get a Mani/ pedi or have coffee with a friend. \n\nThis should not be at the expense of your sleeping however. Night shift workers desperately need their sleep. \n\nYou both need to come up with a plan that doesn't involve you compromising your sleep or work. NAH unless she insists on you taking on more than you can give.", "This is a hard one. I\u2019m going to say NAH here, simply because it seems that you\u2019re both maxed out on time. A baby is hard work and a lot of sacrifice to time and sleep.\n\nIs there a way that you guys can compromise and get a sitter or family member to watch the baby like 1-2 times a week for a few hours?", "NTA.\nYou and wife both know by know there are days with the baby you can get things done, and other days you seem unable to put them down at all.   Work around that and mutually understand and appreciate that.\n\nFrom what I can tell, if she is asking for that, she should be able to get SOME chores done.  The baby hangs out sometimes, content to sit and watch you. She can be doing lots more chores.   The baby at 6 months almost certainly naps too.  She gets built in breaks then, and can nap herself, read, etc.  or do some chores.   I\u2019m sure you\u2019re both burnt out, but per post and a comment she also gets plenty of time to herself out with friends, which is a luxury for any parent much less with a 6 month old and a husband who works night shift.   \n\nI think you guys just need to realign a few things for everyone\u2019s benefit.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a hard and fast chore chart, and who gets time when, you both need to learn to be flexible.", "NTA\n\nIt looks like you're the one being overworked. Your wife can take time to herself when the baby is asleep, or even put the baby on a crib and relax a little, but you have to run around buying groceries, cleaning, cooking, dishes... In top of your security guard job.\n\nExplain to your wife that you're also being overworked, and maybe you two can compromise on some days of the week where you take care of the baby, but she has to do groceries or clean.", "Struggling to decide between nta and nah. I think one thing many couples have to grapple with when they have kids is that even if you split household work (as in paid work, chores and parenting) 50/50, that\u2019ll still be too much for each of you, especially without additional help. The statements \u2018she needs more free time\u2019 and \u2018you physically can\u2019t do more or sleep less\u2019 can both be true, and so the latter isn\u2019t a good solution to the former. I wish you the best with finding a good solution", "Im going to say NTA. Its a tricky one though. It sounds like youre both going full steam all the time. Youre right that being a SAHM is exhausting work, but so is working full time and carrying 95% of the household load. I understand where you are both coming from. Maybe talk to her about it and find a system where you both get breaks from your normal schedule. Once you kid is in school, life will be different, but it sounds like youre both heading to burnout now. My husband and I have things divided pretty evenly and yet we both still make sure to find daily breaks for the other and a couple times a month make sure we each have a day to do whatever we would like. Find something that works for you, but shes asking for a reason, dont ignore that.", "This is honestly a hard situation. I really don\u2019t understand the way you divided the chores, and it doesn\u2019t really seem to be working for you. I think more than anything she may need time away from the baby. Would she consider a part time job or something like that? Maybe having an extra source of income cold be helpful. It would give her time away from the baby and you could manage to pay a babysitter or something. I would say NTA because you seem to be doing a lot, maybe you just need different arrangements.", "NTA. Cutting down on sleep is not the solution. Maybe she could look into play groups in the area or something like that. You sound like you are doing all you can but you need a full nights sleep to remain healthy", "NAH. Your division of labor is in her favor, no doubt. But, that doesn't mean she doesn't need a break.\n\nYou need to talk it through, because there may be a way to shift responsibilities so she gets a break without you losing time. Saying no here is not one of your options, saying yes is also a bad idea.", "NAH. It looks like  y'all had the right  intentions but are finding out it doesn't always work that way. I would suggest revisiting the division of responsibilities and this time try to split them up more evenly instead of one person primarily on baby duty and one person primarily on house duty. \n\nAlso, see if a trusted family member or friend can come over and watch the little one once or twice a week so that you and your wife can have some baby free time. That is something new parents often forget that they need.", "NTA, but I really think y\u2019all\u2019s division of labor is not ideal for either of you. \n\nWhen you\u2019re at work, she\u2019s at work caring for baby and the house. Chores  that can reasonably be done with a baby should be done by your wife. \nWhen you\u2019re home (and awake after getting a reasonable amount of sleep), chores, child care, and alone time should be split equally between the two of you. \n\nSweeping, dishes, laundry, etc CAN be reasonably done most times with a baby. Cooking dinner, cleaning kitchen after dinner, mopping the floors, etc cannot. (I have a 4 month old, so I am speaking from experience). \n\nThe time you\u2019re awake in the evenings after sleep and before work, that\u2019s where the division of labor (chores and childcare) takes place. \n\nOn your days off, split those day into 3-4 hour shifts on baby duty, so each of you gets an equal amount of free time and baby duty.", "NTA. You're more than pulling your weight, and you offered a fair compromise to give her more free time on the weekends.  Her request that you get less sleep is unfair.", "ESH this division of labor is stupid. Your wife will need some time without the baby and you need more time with the baby. 30 minutes isn't enough time to bond with them. Divide the chores more evenly and have daily interaction time with the baby.", "NAH. SAHM is indeed a lot of work, but it usually involves doing most of the chore as well as taking care of the children. She's asking that you forfeit the time when you sleep, you still need to sleep.\n\nA 6-month-old child is a lot of work and it seems like you are both overworked. New parents always are.\n\nIf the baby is too much for her, it's ok to switch, but then she'd have to do some chores to lighten your load.", "NTA. When do you get a time off for yourself? You do the bulk of the chores on top of working night shift. Maybe reach a compromise where you both get a break.", "NAH I think the main problem for her is that all she is, is the mother. She is just around her baby except the few weekends with friends. You have work and go grocerie shopping, you go under people that are not a baby, you are moe then just the parent. I don't think she feels overworked but she won't just get out from the role to just be mom. I also wonder when you did the last time something as a pair? Maybe you have a friend or family who can take the child for a few hours in the week?", "NTA - you are working a night job so when are you supposed to sleep? She is right, she does need time to herself but as you suggested , doing stuff alone/with friends on the weekends could be a reasonable compromise.", "NAH She may be overwhelmed by caring for the baby and not getting any space to recharge and just be in her own headspace a little while. On the other hand you do most of everything else and should rightfully get to sleep. My advice is talk to each other and try and work something out together.", "NTA. It sounds like you work nights, which is already a rough gig, but in top of that you\u2019re more than pulling your weight around the house as it is. If your wife wants some time to herself she could arrange for baby to spend some time with grandparents or other family for a few hours a week, or pay for a babysitter if you can afford it.", "NTA, neither is your wife. Baby care is very specific work with massive responsibility and very little breaks, so one person doing it all even if the other person is doing most of the housework and going to work is going to start wearing them thin after a while. \n\nI think you need to have a calm and honest discussion as a couple. Tell your wife that you understand where she's coming from, but make it clear that you are doing as much as you can and can't take on any more without her taking on some of your household duties. You two should make a new work plan and share the duties between the two of you so that it's less monotonous for her and that BOTH of you get some time for yourself. I'd also recommend hiring a baby sitter every now and then or trying to find a friend or a relative to watch the baby for free occasionally. You need some quality couple time as well. \n\nFinally - congratulations, you sound like a great dad and husband and your family is lucky to have you.", "NTA \n\nYou need at least 6-7 hours sleep a day\n\nYou are already doing most stuff at home, even making her breakfast before you go to sleep, she has the good life, you should say no", "Info how many hours do you sleep during the days? And how many hours does she sleep regularly?", "Ok NTA if she was a doing what a standard SAHM does it would be different. The chores need to be divided 50/50 not 9/10. When you are up then you help with the kid more. Also you both should get one or two Sundays a month for a few hrs to be alone and decompress. This is not a hard fix at all.", "I read in another post that make total sence to me (new mom here) is that both partners get the same hours of rest (sleep in this case) so if she sleep all night, you should sleep all day.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NAH, you guys need another set of hands. I'm guessing sleep deprivation is a huge factor.\n\nI'm siding with your wife, but I'm essentially a SAHM myself and had very bad PPD, so I'm biased. With a baby there is no slow down or pause; one is constantly attending to their needs. Even when mine were sleeping I felt like I was just waiting for them to wake up rather than resting. As someone who is highly introverted and desires a lot of alone time... this was overwhelming for me.\n\nHopefully you can find a neighbour, family or friend to watch the baby for a few hours a week.", "NTA...there's only so much of you to go around. If you need to give in that regard,  then she has take on something else to make it possible.", "Imo NAH. You doing ok tho? Sounds like there is a lot on your plate and asking you to make such a big decision in regards to both of your lives is a lot. It was smart to reflect on it as well as not answer right away, there\u2019s A LOT of factors to consider in this. Maybe a discussion on how it would impact you as well as what you are also feeling so that there is a chance for a mutually beneficial compromise", "NTA she needs to do her part too", "NTA. It is not ok that your wife is expecting you to cut your sleep. People are notorious for thinking people who work night shift need less sleep because they\u2019re sleeping during the day, when in actuality, working nights makes you more tired. You are contributing to childcare when you\u2019re off and in the mornings, so she is getting breaks, time to sleep in, nights of not getting up etc.  She is also very lucky that you basically do all the housework even though you\u2019re the only one working. As she only has one child, she is also getting breaks while babe is napping. I am a mom of two young kids, honestly your wife\u2019s set-up sounds like a dream. If she needs more breaks from her child, she should work and then your child can be in day care during that time. Or stuff needs to be divided better with her doing more housework, but even then if she\u2019s asking you to sleep less than 8 hours consistently, that\u2019s unfair.", "NTA. She has to do her part, u barely have time for yourself and u work, u need to sleep too.", "NAH. I can totally understand your point of view, feeling like you\u2019re doing so much, but I suspect this is about a whole lot more than doing chores and needing a break from the little one. \n\nBecoming a mother, especially one whose entire day is focussed on your child, is a huge change for a person. Mothers can feel a real loss of identity, since their sense of value can change with not working a traditional job, not getting to have adult conversations during the day, not having time for hobbies or activities that bring joy and passion. I\u2019d recommend reading FairPlay by Eve rodsky to get an idea of what this can feel like for a mom, but also to make sure that when you say 95% of the chores, you know that that is accurate. Generally speaking, the secondary parent (I.e. not the primary one) doesn\u2019t really realise all the work, both mental and physical that goes in to running a household. \n\nI get you\u2019re probably exhausted too, so maybe approaching this from a different angle, and trying to understand what your wife is feeling, even she can\u2019t articulate it, and sitting down to discuss how you can both do things that make you feel passionate, could bring back some joy and balance.", "NTA\n\nBut you have to change something.\nMaybe you could divide the work a bit differently. Maybe she feels like she can't take a real break because her mind is constantly on the child. So maybe she can do the cooking or laundry while you take care of the child. \nSo that she can fully fokus on anything but childcare", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The Somalian would wear one in a baby carrier on her belly and one on her back while she cleaned and cooked and did the housework.", "I so wanted to come in here and throw down the biggest AH ever in Reddit history .... \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 ... But honestly dude, you sound like you are doing your share of things. I 100% agree a mom needs some help, but dad's need help to. Especially ones that work a night shift, do a bunch during the day while they are awake, and help out so early in the morning. \n\nNTA. I don't think you sleeping less during the day where you work at night is a good idea. That is just screaming for you to accidently hurt yourself or others or miss something you need to pay attention to while at work. \n\nIf you happen to have any family or friends that could help out, please ask them. Or there are even babysitters that could come to your home and watch the baby while your wife is at home. Nanny-ish I guess. Wishing you guys some peace and. Rest for the holidays and time to come", "I came here ready to say you were the ah but reading it no you will burn yourself out if you are not sleeping after a night shift while doing all the chores as a sahm she should be doing more house hold things while at home with the child I know that's not always possible depending on the child but you are doing a lot already", "NTA, sounds like you two need to reevaluate who does what. Spending all of your time with a screaming baby is hard work, but then again so is doing most of the chores and working full time. Split what you do already with each other and it should make things easier", "NAH but reconsider the division of labor. When our baby was a few months old my husband took point on the chores and sometimes I had to beg him to let ME do the chores so I could get a break from the baby. His intentions were good - he wanted to take as many things off my plate as possible - but caregiving for long stretches of time sometimes made me forget I was my own person. We switched off more often and we were both happier for it - I had more time to myself (even if it was to do work) and he had more time playing with the baby.", "NTA: while my SO was on maternity leave and I was at work we divided the time I was home equally. It\u2019s important that everyone gets time to themselves, work doesn\u2019t count. \nWhat you do what that time is totally up to you. We each try to give the other one whole weekend morning (till 11am) off. My SO uses this time to sleep I go fishing. \nHonestly sometimes doing the dishes is a break. We kinda fight over who gets to be alone in the kitchen with a podcast for 30 minutes.", "Why not switch some roles", "NAH. You mentioned the chores you do, would you not have to do those chores anyway if you were a single person living by yourself? You then went on to describe the things she does, which are mainly baby-related but it sounds like you do 50% of the chores overall and she does 50% of the chores overall. You want her to take the baby to appointments, make baby food, look after the baby everyday as well as mop the floors, vacuum, do all of the dishes all of the time, all of the laundry, and do the grocery shopping? \n\nIt sounds like you're both in need of a break but you think that your wife has it easy.", "NTA - I think you should talk to her and see to what you can change so you both feel ok with the situation. Just saying no will build up some hard feelings on her side. Be careful on how you approach this subject because it so easy to start arguing on who does more.", "Yta this is both your baby and stop talking about agreement", "NTA. She has it comfy she is taking the mick and you shouldn\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019d be very clear with her and say no", "I was thinking that sounded like PPD as I read that.", "I\u2019m a SAHM and while my husband works and cooks, I take care of two small kids and do the housework too. The wife sounds very lucky", "Good idea, this way they can divide the chores more reasonably as well. Since one person doing 90% is not fair either.", "I think op said in a comment that they can\u2019t afford it right now. Maybe his wife could look into getting a part time job? That way they have extra income for a baby sitter and she gets some time away from the house/baby.", "Love the sitter or family member idea. Clearly they both just need secluded time that doesn\u2019t ask any responsibilities of them. They don\u2019t seem to have any outside of sleep. This is so important and it\u2019s not talked about much, from what I\u2019ve seen at least.", "Second this.  What you are both doing is not long term sustainable. It\u2019s not healthy.  She needs time away from the kid (good for baby too) but you also need breaks *and* more baby bonding time.  No where is there time together - also important for all 3 of you.  You need to reset on chores, find healthy activities to do together (like a daily walk) and try an eliminate what you can from daily tasks.  This was my biggest challenge but baby will get more independent and things will get easier but until then maybe sheets are changed less, floors mopped less, meals prepped ahead together so you can have down time popping something pre-made in.  NTA but keep in mind this isn\u2019t about \u201cfree time for her\u201d. It\u2019s a mental health need - for both of you.", "Yup, they need to trade some chores for childcare.  I passed off bathtime to my husband, and I took over dishes on bath night\u2014I get quiet childfree time watching trashy TV, and he gets special bonding time with the kiddo.", "I agree that this is a division of labor issue but I'm going with NAH. Working nights is super hard when you have a little kid that goes to bed early. We tried having my husband work an off shift when our daughter was a toddler and it was a complete disaster. He barely ever saw her. It was exhausting for both of us. He ended up going back to his first shift job so he could be awake when our kid was awake too. The wife is suggesting this guy do more childcare by sleeping less, which isn't really a workable solution. I'm not sure how they could fix it because a security guard probably has to work nights, though. Maybe make a more conscious effort to solo parent on the weekends so wife has a formal break from the baby? I feel like if they completely switched roles during the weekend that might work. Regardless, I don't think it makes either of them assholes.", "Came here to say this. This is the right answer", "Right? OP seems kind of dismissive of the work that goes into a baby ALL THE TIME like changing diapers, etc. Wife getting a break from the baby to do regular chores and vv might give him a better idea of what it\u2019s actually like, and that gives her a break from constantly taking care of another tiny human.", "This is the only an answer.", "I agree, but it seems like the wife is not willing to do more chores. I think they need a real conversation about the division of responsibilities, but still NTA, he seems willing to compromise so maybe with an sincere talk the wife will too", "She tends to go out once every other weekend already.", "At 6 months the baby naps.  That\u2019s when I recharged, cooked and cleaned.", "I tend to sleep from 10 in the morning to 5-6 in the afternoon.   \n\n\nShe sleeps from 9-10 in the afternoon to about 8 in the morning, but this is with her getting woken up once or twice in the night.", "Maybe its not frequent enough but she does go out at least every other weekend without our child.", "NAH is what your judgement should be then", "I admit that she may be doing more than 5% of the chores if you consider the time she puts into making the childs food, but I don't consider those chores in the common sense. In the sense of housework that is done when you don't a child, I feel its more than fair to say that she only does 5% of the chores.", "No you are right, washing more than one baby bottle AND folding one (1) load of laundry is more than 50%, not 5%. Clearly OP is just lazy for doing literally all the other chores but he should just \"take it like a man\" am i right? SAHM standards are dropping more and more every day and you can actually stay here and claim that sitting on your ass all day watching a baby is harder than working a night job and doing all the chores in the house. Those lazy men smh /s", "She gets time to herself at least every other weekend where I will stay up during the day with our child. She will often go out with friends or to visit her sister during those days.   \n\n\nI will agree that she is \"on call\" with a child, and I say this without any malice, but she gets \"calls from the child\", as it would be, while watching Netflix and when she is spending time on the computer.", "But shes not 23/7. She apparently gets weekends off whenever she wants, doesn't do breakfast, and even if she doesn't want weekends off he still does nights with the kid on weekends. \n\nAlso, \n\n>Working full time and doing chores is not nearly as hard as taking care of an infant around the clock. You would have to do all that stuff even if you didn\u2019t have kids and a wife.\n\nThis is *technically* true but hes carrying the chore load of a baby and an extra person since he has a baby and a wife.", "We don't have the money to hire extra help. What extra money we do have we both agree needs to be saved for an emergency since we haven't fully recovered from the cost of the birth of our child.   \n\n\nI also don't tell her no all the time. I try to give her as much free time as I can, and have to the point where she is now asking me to sleep less when sleep is practically the only time I have for myself.", "If the roles were reversed, dad would be the AH for not helping enough.  Dad does just as much with the baby as mom based on the amount of time they are absolve.  Mom needed to pick up more chores.  She\u2019s at home all day with one 6 month old.  That really isn\u2019t a lot.  I\u2019m a mom before you try to say I\u2019m a dad.", "I think the word you're looking for is selfish...", "When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve gone out, and how frequently?", "Oh I didn\u2019t see that. Neither of us go out without the family right now. Is she having trouble with PPD?", "Do you know how often she is woken up and how long she\u2019s awake each time?", "Yes I read that. \nCould be I'm totally misunderstanding your wife. What I mean is more like a lunch break at work. If your head is stuck in work topics its not really a break and a weekend is not gonna fix that.\n\nAlso You do a lot. Like seriously more than I personally could take. So to give her some time to relax her brain during day to day life without loading more on your plate i would suggest she takes over some chores while not having to mind the child. An equal exchange of time and work", "It might benefit her to look for a part time job, there\u2019s bound to be companies out there looking for someone to do a couple of four hour shifts a week for example. \n\nEven if she\u2019s only earning enough to pay for a babysitter while she works or someone to clean the house once a month, the socialisation and time away from just being a mother can be really beneficial.", "Unless they\u2019re saying the baby is the asshole \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 (disclaimer: that was a joke and I agree with you assessment of NAH)", "That's a ton of work. Not havimg alone time sucks. Especially when you are around your child all day everyday. Parents deserve breaks when all they do is focus on the child(ren). Diapers, baths, meals, multiple clothes changes, trying to get to rest/nap, picking up toys, entertaining the child, dishes, other messes, tantrums, soothing the child when they aren't feeling well, add in she is probably trying to get herself dressed, showered, fed. It isn't unreasonable to want a small break. Just ask a therapist. It taxing on parents and they occasionally need to recharge.", "Okay you\u2019ve just demonstrated how little you value her contribution.\nWhen you have a child nearly every chore is a) related back to them, and b) harder to do with them.\nYour kid is 6 months old.\nYour wife spends her days not as an adult with agency but as a servant to the whims of an irrational and unreasonable infant.\nYou admit you spend 30 minutes with your kid a day. Frankly? That\u2019s pathetic.\nEven if you work full time there are at least 4 hours of the day in which your child is going to be awake and you\u2019re around and you engage for all of 30 minutes, but sure you\u2019re doing too much in the house. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\nShe deserves down time.", "I was going to vote NAH. But now it\u2019s a YTA. You devalue you wife and the work that goes into caring for a child 24/7. You act as though she sits around all day twiddling hers thumbs watching you do everything. BS.", "Except by his own admission she does all the baby related chores. Which add up to more than his very imbalanced assessment of 5%.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem very cognisant of child care burdens.", "Well yall need to find some compromise because losinf sleep is not the answer....her building resentment because she can't get alone time isn't helpful...her family or your family some friends willing to help is an option?", "I am also a mom and am lucky my spouse understood raising kids is exhausting and was there when I needed him. My kids are now adults and understand what a good husband:dad looks like", "I don't enjoy going out, but I about once a week I will find the time to sit down without our child for an hour or two and watch a movie or maybe play a video game.", "She doesn't pick up toys, or do the majority of dishes. Most messes that aren't immediately needed to clean up I deal with when I either get home or wake up.   \n\n\nShe does change the childs clothes but I do the laundry for everyone in the house. I will give out child baths at least three days out of the week depending on how long dinner took to make, and on weekends. I didn't consider it a chore to mention as I think its a good bonding experience. I also give our child breakfast and help feed them dinner, and change their diaper whenever it needs to be done and I notice it before my wife, although I will admit that she probably changes at least three times as many diapers as I do.", "this comment is so unreasonable.  30 min does seem like a small amount of bonding time but working nights is hard as well.  When you get home in the morning you have a  little bit of time before you crash OP said in that time he feeds the baby.  Then when he wakes up yes he spends 30 min with the baby before he most likely has to maintain the household before dinner time then back to work.  I don't think he devalues her contribution at all, by taking on 95% of the household maintenence it frees up some of her time to get time to herself(babies do sleep you know) As a mother to a 3 yr old and now 8 month old I can tell you when they go down for nap times that's when I run around and do the laundry clean the house get dinner prepped etc.  if I didn't have to do all that it would be no problem to get \"me time\"", "\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", "he also clearly said in comments she goes out with her friends some weekends while he keeps the baby", "Sure caring a child 24/7 is tiring. What about doing most of the chores and doing a full time job on top of that?", "You must have read a different thread to the rest of us. OP clearly listed out the chores his wife does, which is not \"all the baby related chores\". OP feeds the baby breakfast, does ALL the laundry (which would include the baby's stuff). OP also gets up during the night during weekends when the baby wakes. OP does the dishes and the grocery shopping. He said some of the baby's dishes are washed by his wife, but did not say all of them, so that too counts towards baby chores. \n\nSAHM is a full time job, but even those with full time jobs contribute to chores such as grocery shopping and cooking. And OP's wife asking him to give up sleep is absolutely not an ok ask.", "\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", "And does she get a 1-2 hour child-free break every weekend? Like just to chill?", "YWBTA 6 month old is still waking up multiple times during night and with all that falling on your wife she\u2019s probably sleep deprived and exhausted. You\u2019re able to do everything because you\u2019re able to recharge your battery with a full nights sleep, she\u2019s not. It\u2019s also possible she may be suffering from postpartum depression. It\u2019s time for some help, a sitter and a maid coming in once a week to mop and clean the bathrooms is worth their weight in gold. It may seem like you\u2019re doing everything and she\u2019s has so little to do but fair isn\u2019t always equal, sounds like your wife is overwhelmed being the main caregiver to the baby, it can also be very isolating which is a tough adjustment for any new STAHM. If she is asking for support during this very vulnerable time, give it to her. Edit typo", "As a former SAHM, work was like a vacation (around other adults? Making money? Shiiiit!). They aren\u2019t really comparable.", "I highly doubt he is doing that much.", "The kid naps. How many comments in this thread are moms saying \"If I didn't have housework to do when my kid napped Id have a lot of me time\"", "This would teach me never to have a baby again with someone who posts this on Reddit", "Why, because lazy men exist but lazy women don't? Pathetic", "That\u2019s not my question."]}
