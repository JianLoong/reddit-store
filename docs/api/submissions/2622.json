Before we had the child we agreed that she would be primarily in charge of childcare, while I would do practically everything else. This includes 95% of chores and other housework, I am the only one between the two of us that works a job(Night Shift Security Guard), I make dinner for the family, etc.   \n\n\nI want to clarify some things before I get INFO'd in the comments. When I say I do 95% of the chores, I mean that my wife will do some of the dishes like the babies bottles or cups when they need to be washed and I am asleep during the day, and occasionally fold a load of laundry that she needed a piece of clothing from before I can get around to it. I vacuum and mop the floors, do the laundry, the dishes, clean the bathrooms, cook dinner and do the grocery shopping. She takes our child to doctors appointments, wakes up with them during the night(on the days I am at work), watches them during the day, and will make baby specific meals(She will puree vegetables and fruit, and cut up smaller portions of chicken).   \n\n\nI do spend as much time as I can with our child. I wake them up in the mornings when I come home from work and feed them breakfast before I sleep. When I wake up I'll try to play with them for about 30 minutes, doing reading and playing with whatever toy they're interested in for the week. During the weekends when I am awake during the night I will be the one who gets up with our child.  \n\n\nThis is coming to a head because as we were eating dinner before I went to work, she asked if there was any way that I could watch our child more due to her feeling like she needs time for herself. At first I thought that she wanted to have more weekend events with her friends while I watch our child during the day, something I am more than okay with and have agreed with multiple times. Instead she was asking that I sleep less during the days that I work so that she can have breaks from the child during the day. I told her that I would think about it at work and I want to say no. I understand that being a SAHM is stressful because you always have to watch the baby, but she doesn't do any chores and from the way things were phrased she wouldn't be willing to take up any chores during the new break I would be giving her. I don't have much time to myself either, but I do understand that she carries the stresses of watching our child most of the time while I don't.  \n\n\nWIBTA if I told my wife that I'm not willing to let my her take a break from watching our child?", "created_utc": 1668769949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyhk4m/wibta_my_wife_wants_more_time_for_herself_when/", "score": 993, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like to go out and get a Mani/ pedi or have coffee with a friend. \n\nThis should not be at the expense of your sleeping however. Night shift workers desperately need their sleep. \n\nYou both need to come up with a plan that doesn't involve you compromising your sleep or work. NAH unless she insists on you taking on more than you can give.", "This is a hard one. I\u2019m going to say NAH here, simply because it seems that you\u2019re both maxed out on time. A baby is hard work and a lot of sacrifice to time and sleep.\n\nIs there a way that you guys can compromise and get a sitter or family member to watch the baby like 1-2 times a week for a few hours?", "NTA.\nYou and wife both know by know there are days with the baby you can get things done, and other days you seem unable to put them down at all.   Work around that and mutually understand and appreciate that.\n\nFrom what I can tell, if she is asking for that, she should be able to get SOME chores done.  The baby hangs out sometimes, content to sit and watch you. She can be doing lots more chores.   The baby at 6 months almost certainly naps too.  She gets built in breaks then, and can nap herself, read, etc.  or do some chores.   I\u2019m sure you\u2019re both burnt out, but per post and a comment she also gets plenty of time to herself out with friends, which is a luxury for any parent much less with a 6 month old and a husband who works night shift.   \n\nI think you guys just need to realign a few things for everyone\u2019s benefit.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a hard and fast chore chart, and who gets time when, you both need to learn to be flexible.", "NTA\n\nIt looks like you're the one being overworked. Your wife can take time to herself when the baby is asleep, or even put the baby on a crib and relax a little, but you have to run around buying groceries, cleaning, cooking, dishes... In top of your security guard job.\n\nExplain to your wife that you're also being overworked, and maybe you two can compromise on some days of the week where you take care of the baby, but she has to do groceries or clean.", "Struggling to decide between nta and nah. I think one thing many couples have to grapple with when they have kids is that even if you split household work (as in paid work, chores and parenting) 50/50, that\u2019ll still be too much for each of you, especially without additional help. The statements \u2018she needs more free time\u2019 and \u2018you physically can\u2019t do more or sleep less\u2019 can both be true, and so the latter isn\u2019t a good solution to the former. I wish you the best with finding a good solution", "Im going to say NTA. Its a tricky one though. It sounds like youre both going full steam all the time. Youre right that being a SAHM is exhausting work, but so is working full time and carrying 95% of the household load. I understand where you are both coming from. Maybe talk to her about it and find a system where you both get breaks from your normal schedule. Once you kid is in school, life will be different, but it sounds like youre both heading to burnout now. My husband and I have things divided pretty evenly and yet we both still make sure to find daily breaks for the other and a couple times a month make sure we each have a day to do whatever we would like. Find something that works for you, but shes asking for a reason, dont ignore that.", "This is honestly a hard situation. I really don\u2019t understand the way you divided the chores, and it doesn\u2019t really seem to be working for you. I think more than anything she may need time away from the baby. Would she consider a part time job or something like that? Maybe having an extra source of income cold be helpful. It would give her time away from the baby and you could manage to pay a babysitter or something. I would say NTA because you seem to be doing a lot, maybe you just need different arrangements.", "NTA. Cutting down on sleep is not the solution. Maybe she could look into play groups in the area or something like that. You sound like you are doing all you can but you need a full nights sleep to remain healthy", "NAH. Your division of labor is in her favor, no doubt. But, that doesn't mean she doesn't need a break.\n\nYou need to talk it through, because there may be a way to shift responsibilities so she gets a break without you losing time. Saying no here is not one of your options, saying yes is also a bad idea.", "NAH. It looks like  y'all had the right  intentions but are finding out it doesn't always work that way. I would suggest revisiting the division of responsibilities and this time try to split them up more evenly instead of one person primarily on baby duty and one person primarily on house duty. \n\nAlso, see if a trusted family member or friend can come over and watch the little one once or twice a week so that you and your wife can have some baby free time. That is something new parents often forget that they need.", "NTA, but I really think y\u2019all\u2019s division of labor is not ideal for either of you. \n\nWhen you\u2019re at work, she\u2019s at work caring for baby and the house. Chores  that can reasonably be done with a baby should be done by your wife. \nWhen you\u2019re home (and awake after getting a reasonable amount of sleep), chores, child care, and alone time should be split equally between the two of you. \n\nSweeping, dishes, laundry, etc CAN be reasonably done most times with a baby. Cooking dinner, cleaning kitchen after dinner, mopping the floors, etc cannot. (I have a 4 month old, so I am speaking from experience). \n\nThe time you\u2019re awake in the evenings after sleep and before work, that\u2019s where the division of labor (chores and childcare) takes place. \n\nOn your days off, split those day into 3-4 hour shifts on baby duty, so each of you gets an equal amount of free time and baby duty.", "NTA. You're more than pulling your weight, and you offered a fair compromise to give her more free time on the weekends.  Her request that you get less sleep is unfair.", "ESH this division of labor is stupid. Your wife will need some time without the baby and you need more time with the baby. 30 minutes isn't enough time to bond with them. Divide the chores more evenly and have daily interaction time with the baby.", "NAH. SAHM is indeed a lot of work, but it usually involves doing most of the chore as well as taking care of the children. She's asking that you forfeit the time when you sleep, you still need to sleep.\n\nA 6-month-old child is a lot of work and it seems like you are both overworked. New parents always are.\n\nIf the baby is too much for her, it's ok to switch, but then she'd have to do some chores to lighten your load.", "NTA. When do you get a time off for yourself? You do the bulk of the chores on top of working night shift. Maybe reach a compromise where you both get a break.", "NAH I think the main problem for her is that all she is, is the mother. She is just around her baby except the few weekends with friends. You have work and go grocerie shopping, you go under people that are not a baby, you are moe then just the parent. I don't think she feels overworked but she won't just get out from the role to just be mom. I also wonder when you did the last time something as a pair? Maybe you have a friend or family who can take the child for a few hours in the week?", "NTA - you are working a night job so when are you supposed to sleep? She is right, she does need time to herself but as you suggested , doing stuff alone/with friends on the weekends could be a reasonable compromise.", "NAH She may be overwhelmed by caring for the baby and not getting any space to recharge and just be in her own headspace a little while. On the other hand you do most of everything else and should rightfully get to sleep. My advice is talk to each other and try and work something out together.", "NTA. It sounds like you work nights, which is already a rough gig, but on top of that you\u2019re more than pulling your weight around the house as it is. If your wife wants some time to herself she could arrange for baby to spend some time with grandparents or other family for a few hours a week, or pay for a babysitter if you can afford it.", "NTA, neither is your wife. Baby care is very specific work with massive responsibility and very little breaks, so one person doing it all even if the other person is doing most of the housework and going to work is going to start wearing them thin after a while. \n\nI think you need to have a calm and honest discussion as a couple. Tell your wife that you understand where she's coming from, but make it clear that you are doing as much as you can and can't take on any more without her taking on some of your household duties. You two should make a new work plan and share the duties between the two of you so that it's less monotonous for her and that BOTH of you get some time for yourself. I'd also recommend hiring a baby sitter every now and then or trying to find a friend or a relative to watch the baby for free occasionally. You need some quality couple time as well. \n\nFinally - congratulations, you sound like a great dad and husband and your family is lucky to have you.", "NTA \n\nYou need at least 6-7 hours sleep a day\n\nYou are already doing most stuff at home, even making her breakfast before you go to sleep, she has the good life, you should say no", "Info how many hours do you sleep during the days? And how many hours does she sleep regularly?", "Ok NTA if she was a doing what a standard SAHM does it would be different. The chores need to be divided 50/50 not 9/10. When you are up then you help with the kid more. Also you both should get one or two Sundays a month for a few hrs to be alone and decompress. This is not a hard fix at all.", "I read in another post that make total sence to me (new mom here) is that both partners get the same hours of rest (sleep in this case) so if she sleep all night, you should sleep all day.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NAH, you guys need another set of hands. I'm guessing sleep deprivation is a huge factor.\n\nI'm siding with your wife, but I'm essentially a SAHM myself and had very bad PPD, so I'm biased. With a baby there is no slow down or pause; one is constantly attending to their needs. Even when mine were sleeping I felt like I was just waiting for them to wake up rather than resting. As someone who is highly introverted and desires a lot of alone time... this was overwhelming for me.\n\nHopefully you can find a neighbour, family or friend to watch the baby for a few hours a week.", "NTA...there's only so much of you to go around. If you need to give in that regard,  then she has take on something else to make it possible.", "Imo NAH. You doing ok tho? Sounds like there is a lot on your plate and asking you to make such a big decision in regards to both of your lives is a lot. It was smart to reflect on it as well as not answer right away, there\u2019s A LOT of factors to consider in this. Maybe a discussion on how it would impact you as well as what you are also feeling so that there is a chance for a mutually beneficial compromise", "NTA she needs to do her part too", "NTA. It is not ok that your wife is expecting you to cut your sleep. People are notorious for thinking people who work night shift need less sleep because they\u2019re sleeping during the day, when in actuality, working nights makes you more tired. You are contributing to childcare when you\u2019re off and in the mornings, so she is getting breaks, time to sleep in, nights of not getting up etc.  She is also very lucky that you basically do all the housework even though you\u2019re the only one working. As she only has one child, she is also getting breaks while babe is napping. I am a mom of two young kids, honestly your wife\u2019s set-up sounds like a dream. If she needs more breaks from her child, she should work and then your child can be in day care during that time. Or stuff needs to be divided better with her doing more housework, but even then if she\u2019s asking you to sleep less than 8 hours consistently, that\u2019s unfair.", "NTA. She has to do her part, u barely have time for yourself and u work, u need to sleep too.", "NAH. I can totally understand your point of view, feeling like you\u2019re doing so much, but I suspect this is about a whole lot more than doing chores and needing a break from the little one. \n\nBecoming a mother, especially one whose entire day is focussed on your child, is a huge change for a person. Mothers can feel a real loss of identity, since their sense of value can change with not working a traditional job, not getting to have adult conversations during the day, not having time for hobbies or activities that bring joy and passion. I\u2019d recommend reading FairPlay by Eve rodsky to get an idea of what this can feel like for a mom, but also to make sure that when you say 95% of the chores, you know that that is accurate. Generally speaking, the secondary parent (I.e. not the primary one) doesn\u2019t really realise all the work, both mental and physical that goes in to running a household. \n\nI get you\u2019re probably exhausted too, so maybe approaching this from a different angle, and trying to understand what your wife is feeling, even she can\u2019t articulate it, and sitting down to discuss how you can both do things that make you feel passionate, could bring back some joy and balance.", "NTA\n\nBut you have to change something.\nMaybe you could divide the work a bit differently. Maybe she feels like she can't take a real break because her mind is constantly on the child. So maybe she can do the cooking or laundry while you take care of the child. \nSo that she can fully fokus on anything but childcare", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When our baby was a few months old my husband took point on the chores and sometimes I had to beg him to let ME do the chores so I could get a break from the baby. His intentions were good - he wanted to take as many things off my plate as possible - but caregiving for long stretches of time sometimes made me forget I was my own person.

You mentioned the chores you do, would you not have to do those chores anyway if you were a single person living by yourself? You then went on to describe the things she does, which are mainly baby-related but it sounds like you do 50% of the chores overall and she does 50% of the chores overall. You want her to take the baby to appointments, make baby food, look after the baby everyday as well as mop the floors, vacuum, do all of the dishes all of the time, all of the laundry, and do the grocery shopping? \n\nIt sounds like you're both in need of a break but you think that your wife has it easy.", "NTA - I think you should talk to her and see to what you can change so you both feel ok with the situation.

The wife sounds very lucky", "Good idea, this way they can divide the chores more reasonably as well. Since one person doing 90% is not fair either.", "I think op said in a comment that they can\u2019t afford it right now. Maybe his wife could look into getting a part time job? That way they have extra income for a baby sitter and she gets some time away from the house/baby.", "Love the sitter or family member idea. Clearly they both just need secluded time that doesn\u2019t ask any responsibilities of them. They don\u2019t seem to have any outside of sleep. This is so important and it\u2019s not talked about much, from what I\u2019ve seen at least.", "Second this.  What you are both doing is not long term sustainable. It\u2019s not healthy.  She needs time away from the kid (good for baby too) but you also need breaks *and* more baby bonding time.  No where is there time together - also important for all 3 of you.  You need to reset on chores, find healthy activities to do together (like a daily walk) and try an eliminate what you can from daily tasks.  This was my biggest challenge but baby will get more independent and things will get easier but until then maybe sheets are changed less, floors mopped less, meals prepped ahead together so you can have down time popping something pre-made in.

The wife is suggesting this guy do more childcare by sleeping less, which isn't really a workable solution. I'm not sure how they could fix it because a security guard probably has to work nights, though. Maybe make a more conscious effort to solo parent on the weekends so wife has a formal break from the baby? I feel like if they completely switched roles during the weekend that might work.

OP seems kind of dismissive of the work that goes into a baby ALL THE TIME like changing diapers, etc. Wife getting a break from the baby to do regular chores and vv might give him a better idea of what it\u2019s actually like, and that gives her a break from constantly taking care of another tiny human.", "This is the only an answer.", "I agree, but it seems like the wife is not willing to do more chores.

Of course, I have normal breaks as well, but it doesn't seem feasible that you'd work so much, do most chores, and then have time to give her more time out of the house.

Sit down together and talk about what both of you need and look at maybe dividing the household chores differently and carving out some time for each of you. Taking care of a baby is mentally taxing in a way chores are not. Figure out ways that you can work breaks into your days. Brainstorm other childcare options. Maybe there\u2019s an aunt or grandparent or someone else that can watch the baby for a couple of hours once a week. Also consider whether you wife needs treatment for PPD. \n\nRaising kids is very difficult and a lot of people are doing it without traditional support systems that humans evolved to expect. Try to expand your support net work and/or loosen your expectations for household chores. Maybe you can get a robot vac or maybe there are certain rooms that don\u2019t need to be vacuumed as often. Focus on the ones the baby crawls around on. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other stuff you could cut out that would give you more free time or would enable you to spend another half an hour with your daughter a day. \n\nIf your wife is mentally healthy and just doesn\u2019t feel like doing her share, that\u2019s a whole different conversation.", "Nobody is an a-hole here.  You are navigating being new parents with rules that were based on projections and assumptions of what that would be like, and how each person's role would feel.  You sound like a nice guy who recognizes the importance of helping out around the house to alleviate stress for your wife who is the caregiver about 90% of the time, it sounds like.\n\nHere is the deal, though, and for the purposes of your question, I am NOT going to focus on all the wonderful things about motherhood and the daily joys you and your wife experience as parents.\n\nDoing chores, while not fun, are acts that one performs free of minute-by-minute distractions and interruptions, if you get to do that without having also to take care of a child.  When you are taking care of a child, and especially if they are not a good sleeper, or they are frequently colicky or sick, or overly active, nothing you do is without a minute . . . perhaps second by second . . . interruption.  A few hours of that is manageable, perhaps, but you get to the end of the last day before a weekend and you can feel like you are slowly going insane.  You will hear SAHM talk about how they took things for granted like being able to go to the bathroom in the exact moment they needed to.\n\nNow, add to that the feelings of isolation.  You get to leave the home to go to work and interact with other adults.  I'm not saying your job is a day in the park, but your wife probably does not have that type of outlet on a consistent, daily basis.  And, if she's given the choice between more adult interaction and maybe even time alone . . . perhaps she is so down that maybe the time alone feels better.\n\nIf your wife had a job or career before she decided to be a SAHM, it is very possible that she is feeling somewhat a loss of identity.  She may be grappling with diminished feelings of value.  I am not saying she should.  No other job is more important in this world than raising decent, happy, contributing members of society, but SAHMs don't get paychecks that reward them for that.  Of course, a happy, healthy human being is a reward in and of itself, but you get my drift.\n\n**SOLUTIONS:**  (1) Many local churches offer \"Mother's Day Out\" programs where staff take care of children giving SAH parents a break.  Some charge a fee, but others do not, and many do NOT require you be a member of the church.  Often the ones that do not charge a fee have the mother's stay on-site and they give them their own space to hang out.  Some mother's use that time to just be social.  Other mothers work on projects (knitting, scrapbooking, etc.).  Other mothers read, or do all their phone conversations they can't at home with a baby.  (2) Suggest to your wife that she join a community SAHP(parent) group.  There are many that will organize group play sessions for toddlers, in which a SAHP hosts a small group of moms/dads and the child/children in their home.  It's not time alone, but it gets your wife out of the same environment day-in, day-out, and she makes new adult friends that are having the same shared experiences.  (3) Have your wife make her own small group of parents with similar aged kids that she could swap out childcare with.  For example, when your baby is older and easier to take care of, she becomes friends with another mom that they routinely watch each other's kids with their own, giving each other a few hours, once or twice a week to have time to themselves.", "This may have more to to with not losing herself to motherhood or needing some mental stimulation or even curbing boredom. Just as your are feeling resentment for your roles she is too. Have her look into some mommy and me play dates or something to get her out of the house. Being a SAHM is very isolating", "NAH but being around a baby all day every day can be very mentally exhausting.

But I didn\u2019t think chicken would be introduced yet\u2026", "\"Not doing much during the day except taking care of an infant\"\n\nSuch a dogshit thing to say.\n\nShe grew a whole person with her body and she tends to 100% of their needs. You don't know if the baby has had colic or has high needs. You just flippantly assume it should be easier? Of course PPD would be unsurprising but so would being overwhelmed and exhausted with this massive life change. \n\nOP, what a out hiring a babysitter for a few hours a day?", "Wow no you're right. There's absolutely NO WAY that growing and giving birth to and then raising a baby while your body tries to heal itself could EVER cause PPD in SO MANY women. It's fake and it sounds like all of these women are just selfish. Babies don't ever wake up 6 times in one night or wake up at 1 am stay up for 6 hours just because. That NEVER happens. It's exhausting for women to have emotions and get depression. Absolutely exhausting. /s", "This is about OP's situation, not your weird resentment for SAHMs.", "No he doesn't watch the baby when he's home either. She never has a break from her work.", "Husband does all the chores minus some edge case scenarios. The baby is young so napping at least 1-2 hours at a clip. In theory she has many 1-2 hour breaks during the day.", "15 bucks minimum per hour. Plus you need a baby sitter you can trust", "And some babies don't give a flying fuck about the \"sleep schedule\" no matter how hard you try to make it work. My 2nd woke every hour for the first 6 months.", "Neither of them appear to be getting breaks, at all.  This isn\u2019t tenable for either one of them.  I think he is aware of how hard it is for her, but probably not to it\u2019s full extent.  She appears to be either oblivious, or herself struggling, hence my mention of PPD.  As I said, something needs to bend, before they both break.  I certainly don\u2019t think he has been dismissive though.  I think his concern lies with the fact that he is stretched so thin, that any less time sleeping, and he could quite literally collapse.", "I\u2019m also sure he goes out with friends. Parents can\u2019t have life\u2019s outside of their kids?", "No need to be obnoxious. I'm stating my thoughts like everyone.", "Mom here! It sounds like it could be poorly worded and that she is pureeing the chicken along with the fruits and veggies. If not it\u2019s totally fine because solids can be introduced at six months, anyway! A lot of parents follow baby led weaning starting at six months which essentially means you give baby modified portions of whatever the rest of the family is eating. Hope this helps!", "Complete aside...the chicken is fine at 6 months. Some baby's get babyfood and purees and others are fed normal food from the start. \nChopping and changing can cause problems but all 4 of mine have had normal meals (albeit very small portions) from when they start on solids.", "My son cut teeth at 4 months and was eating off my plate instead of jars of food by 6 months. It all depends on the baby", "I like how I never said anything negative about stay at home moms and you still came to that stupid conclusion.", "Tell me you've never taken care of a baby without telling me you've never taken care of a baby.", "So, you're not kidding. You're just oblivious to clear signs of somebody struggling mentally.\n\nI hope you're single. You got some work to do fam.", "I think he\u2019s being UNINTENTIONALLY dismissive bc he hasn\u2019t done enough baby care to know really what it\u2019s like. And it\u2019s a mental drain never getting to be around other adults like at work. They need to split the chores and childcare up more fairly.", ">but fair isn\u2019t always equal, sounds like your wife is overwhelmed being the main caregiver to the baby\n\nI agree with this. Wife should switch to working the night shift, bathing and feeding the kids, doing laundry, doing dishes, washing the floors and OP should get to sit on his ass all day watching the baby. Sounds fair, right?", "You made your feelings clear. You literally went on a mini rant about how you think people give SAHMs too much credit by assuming PPD is a factor in being a SAHM.", "What clear signs, exactly? Spell them out for me, because I am also clearly missing something? From the OP, we hear all about what they do, and pretty much nothing about the wife other than she literally only does things relating to the child, not the rest of the household, and only when the OP is out of the house. Where exactly is there even close to enough info to even guess at the wife's mental state?", ">You're just oblivious to clear signs of somebody struggling mentally.\n\nI have 2 children and my wife had PPD with the 2nd. I was the one that recognized it straight out the gate, tried to get her to make an appointment, then made one for her, then drove her, then had to practically drag her into the office.\n\nIt only took 4ish months of hell from start to the meds kicking in full force and for her to go mostly back to normal.\n\nSo no, I'm not oblivious to the signs of mental health struggles. OP gave exactly 0 indication that there is a mental health crisis going on here. This sub loves to jump on \"oh there's a mental health issue\" but sometimes people are just selfish and lazy.", "But baby\u2019s naps aren\u2019t going to be uninterrupted or guaranteed.", "No lazy women do exist. It has nothing to do with him be a man and her a women. Grow up. It has everything to do with the making his wife the villain in all his comments that I said I highly doubt he does that much work.", "What is she doing during nap time?  He already does all the chores.  She is getting child free \u201cme time\u201d every day while the kid sleeps because he takes care of almost everything in the house.", "So you acknowledge lazy women exist but you are 100% sure this is not the case, judging by all the 0 arguments you have. Solid\ud83d\udc4d", "OP gets 1-2 hour weekly break to play games, etc. I\u2019m simply asking does she. Why so defensive and I\u2019m not even asking you?", "I never said she wasn\u2019t lazy. I said I highly doubt he does 95 percent based off of his comments. Sorry it seems to bother you so much! Have a fantastic day!!", "I think the answer you\u2019re getting is she has that every day during nap time rather than only weekly. Babies nap a lot.", "1) it\u2019s a public forum, idc if you asked me.  I answered.  2) like you said, he gets \u201c1-2 hours a week to video game\u201d she gets 1-3 hours /DAY that the kid is sleeping where she has nothing to do because he does everything.", "stop JAQing (just asking questions) off.", "You know what you were doing. Not sneaky enough."]}
