I'll book a room tonight and give you a chance to bond with the baby while I'm away, dear.\"", "NTA. It sounds like your husband is volunteering to do the 2am feed. I would point blank and ask him if he will wake up with the baby at 2am.   If it's that important you're up at six then he needs to start sharing the night feed with you.    Honestly, it sounds like he should be helping more anyway if he's that alert.", "Any chance you are feeding with formula or can pump enough for a bottle? If so, let him take care of feeding the baby for a few of the nights. I'm a dad and I did the night shift  for my kids from day 1, so I know it can be done.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWhy doesn't your husband get up in the middle of the night to help with baby? If breastfeeding,  he can wake up, do diaper changes, and stay awake until you fall back asleep  with that attitude.", "NTA, sleep is important especially when you're taking care of a young child.", "NTA - it's vacation not wake-up-earliation. Why is your husband being shitty and not helping with the baby? He's the AH.", "NTA and if he wants you all to be up that early then he can take the night shift.", "NTA\n\nI know you\u2019re seeing in laws but you\u2019re also on a holiday and should be spending that time to unwind and relax, especially if you\u2019re caring for a young child. You being tired is just going to lead to you dropping the ball, not wanting to socialise and just stress you out more than you need to. You\u2019re not waking up at 2pm, you still get plenty of time to spend with his family\n\nAre you able to pump and then let your husband get up in the night to feed? Not only is he not sharing the burden of looking after your child (which I do get to an extent if you can\u2019t bottle feed or whatever), he\u2019s then not making up for it and is being passive aggressive instead of at least supporting you how he can. You should be a team, if his parents have made comments he should be shutting them down straight away. There\u2019s nothing inherently better about waking up early or late, you\u2019ve just recently had a baby that requires a lot of care  and you need to do what YOUR body needs, sod anyone else.", "NTA - regulate him for the 2am baby night duty for a week.

That way you can get up every day fresh as a daisy at 6 AM\u2026. After a great nights sleep and thank you very much for suggesting such a thing because yes, you desperately need a vacation to.

I don\u2019t know if you are nursing or not, but as someone who nearly exclusively BF my own kids, I would have bought some bottles of formula and left my husband to figure it out for a night if he pulled that kind of bullshit.", "Perfect!", "NTA\n\nSLEEP!!\nYou absolutely need sleep. Sleep deprivation is sleep deprivation, no matter which country or culture you\u2019re visiting. You need your health and mental clarity, your baby does, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re in an area that makes a new mother who loses hours of sleep every night feel like crap for \u201csleeping in\u201d, then you can rightfully tell those people- especially your well-rested and clueless  husband- where to go. Your husband and in-laws can wait, or they can go about their business/visit/whatever until 10/noon so you can get your rest and get ready for the day. You have an infant- their inability to be empathetic and flexible is on them.\n\nSpeaking of flexibility, your husband needs to be getting up for night feedings. Tell him he\u2019s so adamant about you being up before the sun with the everyone, that you\u2019re on vacation and he\u2019ll be talking over feedings. Make up some bottles for the baby, get some ear plugs for yourself and let him have at it.", "Thank him for offering to take the night shift so that you can be well rested for 6 AM. What a sweetheart for offering! NTA", "I couldn't breastfeed my first two kids, but with my third, I could. Hubby was working 11hr days, 6 days a week during that time and would wake up with me every night to do the feeds because it was easier for me, plus our princess would only burp for him. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOP, your hubby needs to step up or shut up. NTA, if he wants you up with the rest of the family, then he needs to make sure you get the sleep you need by taking over the nightly feeds. \n\nI don't have insomnia, but I struggle to get to sleep every night, and when I wake up during the night, I struggle to get back to sleep. I can roll over and go back to sleep, but if I'm awake more than 90 seconds, yeah, nope, my brain is awake and racing again. I was able to use a lavender pillow for a while, which helped, but it didn't last. Are their any scents you find that make you sleepy that you could possibly rotate out when they stop working (meds didn't work for me)."]}
