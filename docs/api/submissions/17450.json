I would point blank and ask him if he will wake up with the baby at 2am.   If it's that important you're up at six then he needs to start sharing the night feed with you.    Honestly, it sounds like he should be helping more anyway if he's that alert.", "Any chance you are feeding with formula or can pump enough for a bottle? If so, let him take care of feeding the baby for a few of the nights. I'm a dad and I did the night shift  for my kids from day 1, so I know it can be done.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWhy doesn't your husband get up in the middle of the night to help with baby? If breastfeeding,  he can wake up, do diaper changes, and stay awake until you fall back asleep  with that attitude.", "NTA, sleep is important especially when you're taking care of a young child.", "NTA - it's vacation not wake-up-earliation. Why is your husband being shitty and not helping with the baby? He's the AH.", "NTA and if he wants you all to be up that early then he can take the night shift.", "NTA\n\nI know you\u2019re seeing in laws but you\u2019re also on a holiday and should be spending that time to unwind and relax, especially if you\u2019re caring for a young child. You being tired is just going to lead to you dropping the ball, not wanting to socialise and just stress you out more than you need to. You\u2019re not waking up at 2pm, you still get plenty of time to spend with his family\n\nAre you able to pump and then let your husband get up in the night to feed? Not only is he not sharing the burden of looking after your child (which I do get to an extent if you can\u2019t bottle feed or whatever), he\u2019s then not making up for it and is being passive aggressive instead of at least supporting you how he can. You should be a team, if his parents have made comments he should be shutting them down straight away. There\u2019s nothing inherently better about waking up early or late, you\u2019ve just recently had a baby that requires a lot of care  and you need to do what YOUR body needs, sod anyone else.", "NTA - regulate him for the 2am baby night duty for a week.
