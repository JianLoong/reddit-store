I know it\u2019s a been a while since I posted so I wanted to add what I think may change some of the opinions about my wife being an a-hole in the situation. Things were kinda tense, but a couple of weeks after the incident she sat me down and told me she was pregnant. The stress about my job, about being a working mom, about our finances in general, are what made her lash out at me the way she did. She apologized, and I forgave her. The baby is doing well, knock on wood, and my wife and I have discussed me going to night school to at least finish out my GED. It\u2019s something I always planned to do, but life gets in the way ya know? After night I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m planning on getting any sort of degree until we\u2019re settled more.\n\nFor now I\u2019m still driving busses, the school year is well under way so I\u2019m not dealing with any sunscreen right now, thank the lord.", "created_utc": 1696454386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zyzq8/update_aita_for_telling_a_mom_her_kid_isnt_special/", "score": 49, "replies": ["#[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ccym5/aita_for_telling_a_mom_her_kid_isnt_special/)", "Funnily enough, I was going through my old reddit comments for updates and read your post last night.

Or do you mean people know the rules by now? Not that the original mum deserved it after being rude to you,  but if you did want to be helpful you could suggest she gets a roll-on rather than spray-on, they make a lot less mess and are just as easy for kids to use.", "Not really, sunscreen is really only a camp problem. Kids don\u2019t wear it going to school, not where I\u2019m from anyways."]}
