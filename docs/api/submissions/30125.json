NTA. The only way this makes sense to me is if this was a misunderstanding, that they thought you'd essentially given the tv to them and / or didn't want it anymore, but you seem to feel that was not at all their understanding. It also defies logic to me, even if they did think that was true, that they wouldn't check in with you first. It all seems so odd but you aren't TA and it seems like they are getting ready to remedy it.", "NTA\n\n>they can\u2019t take back a gift.\n\nAsk them how is that any more wrong than giving away something that isn't theirs? Easy fix, buy you a new TV of the same size. Period.", "NTA...Your parents gave away something that wasn't theirs to give, and they didn't even have the decency to check with you first. You are owed an apology. Luckily they are taking enough responsibility to get the television back.  Fingers crossed!", "NTA - \"we're so sorry, we gave you the tv thinking we could, but we were mistaken and it wasn't ours to give away. Let us get you something else for your place.\" If your cousin isn't understanding of that, they're an AH. Or your parents could just buy you a new TV.", "NTA. You are 100% in the right here and you parents absolutely need to get your TV back. Even though they had been using it for an extended period of time, they knew it wasn't theirs and at the bare minimum should have gotten your permission before giving it away. There is absolutely no excuse - either they should get the TV back or replace it for you. No reason to feel guilty for standing your ground.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re not making your parents look bad, they did that to themselves. Whether they get the TV back or they pay you for the cost of it, they gave away your property without your consent. Their excuses don\u2019t mean they can\u2019t make it right, they are just trying to get out of making it right.", "You've indicated that they admitted they made a mistake and will try to get it back. I'm guessing buying a replacement isn't an option for them?\n\nYou mentioned your parents help you out a lot. Is it enough that you feel like it would be fair to let their mistake slide, particularly as they've admitted it was a mistake? Or maybe even split the cost of a replacement? \n\nRegardless, I'd say NAH since you're in the right for wanting your things back and your parents are doing the right thing by trying to fix the situation they've created. It sounds like it was also very much an innocent mistake if the TV was with them for a long time (not that that's an excuse, but it's helpful context).\n\nThe only other thing I would say is to be gentle with them about it if you otherwise have a great relationship with them and they do indeed help you out a lot. I'm a bit concerned that you're saying you're \"demanding\" it in case that indicates you're being very aggressive about it with them. It was stupid for them to give something away that wasn't theirs and you're absolutely in the right to want it back, but everyone occasionally does stupid things and what's important is that they admit it and try to fix it.", "You can't gift something that isn't yours.\n\nNTA\n\nIf your parents won't contact the cousin then you should and ask for your property back.", "NTA Call your cousin or send a text and say, my parents gifted you my TV by mistake.

They have stolen your TV.\n\nThey knew it wasn\u2019t theirs. By passing it on, they have shown that they intended to \u201cpermanently deprive\u201d you.

Your parents *should* buy you a identical replacement tv for the one they used and then gifted your cousin so they could look generous. Don\u2019t hold your breath on that either though. Maybe a psychologist could explain that little rush they get from being generous with someone else\u2019s property. You may have to chalk this loss up as a learning experience :  if you leave a possession in your parents\u2019 house or garage for whatever reason, they are going to regard it as theirs to do with as they please.

I asked if I could have  it and my sister said yes. My mom didn't realize my sister had already given it to me so when my brother (no longer living at home) was visiting and asked about it she gave it to him.

Would you have left it in a storage unit and then had to pay fee's until you were ready to use it or shoved it in a closet? If the answer is shoved it in a closet then you should have done that in the first place if it meant so much to you. \n\nThey gifted it away, not sold it and made a profit.
