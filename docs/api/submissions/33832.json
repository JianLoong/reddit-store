My friend was to my left, and a girl who sat behind me. Throughout the class I kept getting whiffs of someone farting. Initially I put it off because I assumed it would stop. \n\nIt then got to a point where it kept happening every 1-2 minutes. We were towards the end of the lecture. I then whispered to me friend \u201cwho the fuck keeps farting this is pissing me off, I can\u2019t focus\u201d, and he starts laughing. Unfortunately the girl behind me heard it, and immediately the girl behind me starts crying. The entire class is now looking towards us because they saw us laughing, followed by her crying. The teacher looks, and she leaves the class.\n\nThe teacher goes outside to ask what happened, he comes back in two minutes later and says \u201c(name of my friend) and (me), come talk to me before lunch\u201d. \n\nHe then calls both of us after class and asks the situation. I explain that I kept getting a bad smell so I whispered to (name of my friend). He then says that she got very embarrassed and should apologize to her the next time I see her. The next day in class, both my friend and I told her we were not making fun of her and did not mean to offend her. She didn\u2019t end up saying anything.\n\nThis was a few days before break, and the situation got reported to the dean. The dean said he will speak to us after break.

She probably heard a bit and assumed you were speaking of her therefore the tears. If the Dean were to take any action I would tell your parents because this is a situation of confusion. The young lady needs to be spoken to as well. Not punished only a kind word by a female. She should have excused herself if possible. Not to mention there are times in life things happen and she needs to be able to deal with life too.", "NTA and really N A H. This is such a non-issue, why was it reported on? Yes, I can see why the girl was upset (as someone with a sensitive stomach I secretly fart a lot and it can be mortifying to know someone has been affected so badly by that) but you didn't embarrass her, she was the one who made it blatantly obvious who dealt it. If you had shouted it out to the whole class sure, but a whisper to your friend? Nope. Next time go old school and pass notes.", "NTA if the smell was that bad and she was doing it regularly she shouldn't be surprised that people will get annoyed", "NAH", "NTA. You smelled something and made a moment to a friend about it. You didn't call anyone out. If she was embarrassed she could have gone to the bathroom instead of dropping ass all class", "I\u2019d say gentle YTA for mentioning the farting, obviously the person isn\u2019t doing it on purpose and is probably really embarrassed about it. Add to that all the usual teenage anxieties and she probably feels completely shitty. But you didn\u2019t single her out or anything, and if she hadn\u2019t started crying no one would have known it was her anyway. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s being taken to the Dean, it seems like a total non-issue to me.", "YTA. I get it; you\u2019re 17 but it\u2019s about time you start growing up and learning some empathy. Someone farting pisses you off? Imagine what it\u2019s like to have IBS or Crones disease. Imagine what it was like for her. She can\u2019t exactly control it.", "You didn't identify, accuse, or make fun of the girl.  Presumably a lot of kids sit near you and could have been causing the problem, and the girl who was farting felt bad when she heard you whisper.  You were asked to apologize and did so.\n\nBut if this has gone to the dean, you might want to get ahead of it.  Perhaps on the first day back, you and your friends and the parents might want to approach the dean with the parents making it clear that they support you and that to their minds, you did nothing wrong.  No targeting.  No taunting.  No bullying.  Not improper comment,  Nothing.\n\nClearly the girl should have excused herself and gone to the rest room, assuming the school doesn't have a stupid policy of severely restricting restroom usage.  In which case, the policy is what should come under fire, not you.\n\nNTA", "YTA you\u2019re a 17 yo male who is pearl clutching over farts?

NTA", "NTA it's weird enough that she felt offended by that, but then the teacher thought you did something wrong, and then they thought it was bad enough that they had to report it to the dean?? Is your school in some bizarre alternate universe or something?", "Do you know that 17 yr olds suffer from  GI conditions such as Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis?\n\nMost people can not control their farts.\n\nYTA", "NTA but pls know I sneezed and farted in school 13 years ago and I'm still lowkey traumatised \ud83d\ude02 honestly the nicest thing you could do is just pretend it didn't happen", "YTA. She was trapped in a classroom and desperately trying not to get noticed. You brought attention to her. The social rule for farts is that if you are in a car and you smell it, open the window. If you are in an elevator or classroom, say nothing and pretend not to notice.", "You\u2019re never an asshole for calling out someone being gross. I\u2019ll die on this bill. If they smell. Tell \u2018em. If they need to go to the bathroom and take a shit, tell \u2018em. If their feet stink, tell them. (I don\u2019t wanna hear I have a condition. There\u2019s treatments for that. You\u2019re lazy and gross).", "NTA What a dumb situation, theres nothing wrong with asking a general question like that. She overreacted when nobody even knew it was her.\n\nI would be pissed if there are any consequences for this, its not like you called out to the class that shes passing gas.", "Nah. You did nothing wrong. But i hope you willen say something nice to her. She's hurt and embarressed. She did it herself but i hope you can make it less worse. Just be nice to her. Don't talk about that farting", "She should have excused herself instead of sitting there ripping away in a class full of people, it\u2019s fucking gross.

She outed herself.", "\"Scent of a Woman\" (1992) flashback - pun intended!", "I'm going to say NAH, but hopefully you and your friend should learn to be more sensitive. I know you didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, but just remember some people have IBD and stuff, and it might be very sensitive for them.\n\nI doubt you'll be in much trouble, if any, if this is an unusual thing for you to be involved in. I would just explain that you made a stupid not even serious comment about possible farts not thinking anyone would overhear because you smelled a smell, and now you feel terrible. I think it would help your case if you sit down and think about how she felt, and tell the dean how you did so, and feel really bad, and you really never meant to make anyone embarrassed. I am certain it sucks enough having such issues, and I think if you feel this way too, and feel really bad that you unintentionally made a silly comment that made her feel worse, I think they'll just want to talk to you probably.\n\nIt might not hurt to try to reach out to the girl just you and not your friend too, and say again, you feel really bad. It might be best if you say something like \"I feel really bad that what I said upset you- I didn't mean you at all. It was stupid really, I thought I smelled something because you know how the school smells weird sometimes, and I made a stupid fart joke. I wasn't talking about you at all. I just wouldn't want you to think I was talking about you.\" It's up to you but that might fix the whole thing. And just be nice to her and stuff, you know? She just doesn't want to feel embarrassed. If it was really only you and your friend, that will help her feel less embarrassed because you still aren't blaming her for the farts. You don't even know she committed them, either.\n\nI remember once in high school, my teacher was talking about something involving why Catholics don't like birth control, and I was raised Catholic, so I explained that they thought it like, stopped an inseminated egg from attaching (I don't think this is true, just what I was taught), and one of the girls said to another is a silly voice \"Inseemmminated. They were inseminated.\" I don't even know if they were trying to poke fun at me, but I was offended, and stopped in the middle of what I was saying, and just gave them a look. I didn't like them much after that. Sometimes it's not even whether you did something embarrassing, as I didn't feel I did, as I wasn't a huge believer then- it was more just thinking someone was trying to make fun in a rude way.\n\nIt would have meant I guess a small amount if they had apologized because a teacher told them too, but if they apologized sincerely one on one, I would absolutely have understood that they weren't trying to ridicule me. Why would they go through the trouble of apologizing one on one again if so? They never apologized period, which is fine, but it would have been nice if they had.\n\nI tend to go on but my point? Apologize again. She was hurt, whether she even farted or not, she thought you were ridiculing her. Making proper amends, more than the teacher said, out of earshot of anyone, and giving her an out, that would be kind. You'll probably be okay anyway though if that's the concern.", "Why is every AITA post I've come across POO mode these days?", "It\u2019s not like u called her out on it so I don\u2019t see what\u2019s the problem", "NAH. The comment wasn't meant to single out and embarrass her, though I bet if you're in the same situation again, you will probably consider the fact that someone might overhear and feel put on the spot. This is an awkward situation for anyone but teenage girls are the most self-conscious people in the world and she was probably sitting there in dread that someone would notice or draw attention to her (particularly boys). By the time you actually mentioned it, her anxiety was likely through the roof and she couldn't help her tearful response. I feel terrible for her, particularly given the drawn out nature of his incident now that teachers are involved, but reportedly there was no cruelty or malice involved, and it's unfortunate both that she overheard you and that her involuntary reaction to your comment put her in the spotlight. \n\nI can understand to a point why things have escalated simply because schools with robust anti-bullying policies need to keep a close eye on situations like this and make sure they get a complete picture before deciding if it should be let go (as it appears in this case) or deserves further discussion. I don't think it's fair they're making you stress over the break, but perhaps the lack of immediacy indicates they're not going to be coming down on you very hard. I hope this gets wrapped up soon so everyone involved can put it behind them.", "Okay maybe you're not a full on asshole, but MAYBE you suck just a little bit still at least.   \n\n\nLike sure, you didn't know who it was and you didn't single out anyone by name, ...but come on. You're 17 years old. Almost an adult. You should maybe be a little bit more mature by now and by now should have the sense to know that saying that is going to embarrass someone anyway because that person is obviously in the same room and could potentially hear you. \n\nLike...you couldn't wait till after class when you left to tell your friend that? Or better yet just suck it up? That's hardly the topic you should be discussing in the middle of class anyhow.
