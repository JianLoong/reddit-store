Sara found out and told Hunter, Hunter was upset but ultimately didn\u2019t care. Sara then decided to call us and yell at us for not letting him help and accused me of not caring about his business.

If anything, her behaviour justifies your decision. Imagine the drama that would\u2019ve happened if you had gone with him and something had happened that you or him weren\u2019t happy about!!", "NTA - rule of thumb. You don\u2019t do business with family. Money cuts even the closest bonds", "NTA.  I don't like doing business with friends and family, because if things go wrong and you have to go after them, of course it causes bad blood.\n\nTry to contact your family members to see what she has said about you.  Let them know that you hope that an issue between you and your sister should not impact your relationship with them.  If they cut you off without hearing you out then sadly they weren't much on your side to begin with.\n\nIt may be good to tell them it all started because you wouldn't let Hunter sell the house.  If they have homes that they plan on selling, the same shunning will happen to them if they don't use him.", "NTA.   \nIt actually should have made sense to keep your business dealings out of family hands. House selling is a costly business, and there\u2019s so very many many ways it can get more expensive, or legally complicated.   \nJust say you were trying to protect your ongoing relationship and if there were issues WITH THE BUYERS not wanting it to put a sourness into your relationship with your BIL.   \nIgnore it all. Your sister obviously is upset about something else and using this as cover.   \n\n\n(And privately, I would be willing to bet two internet cookies the issue is that your sister/BIL live dramatically past their financial means, like the vast vast vast majority of RE agents, and probably are up to their eyeballs in debt. Not only did you not give them the chance to earn a commission from your property sale, you are moving somewhere awesome, cashed up, and debt free\u2026 so she\u2019s envious/creating drama to hide her own shame.)", "NTA, it's good that Hunter doesn't really care but your sister seems to be hurting a lot more than just \"she didn't use my husband's business\" I would personally send out a mass text or make a social media post where all your family can see to get your side out \n\nI would remove the fact that you're uncomfortable with her husband specifically and just go with \"I don't feel comfortable doing business with family and Hunter counts as family\", just focus on rectifying your sisters words as they're doing the most damage at this moment", "NTA - what sucks is normally common wisdom is to not do business with family as to avoid drama, but it seems like it still came looking for you. You are under absolutely no obligation to use H\u2019s services. For S to not only be upset but to cause division in the family IMO is uncalled for and petty. \nHOWEVER maybe the way you feel about H isn\u2019t as low-key as you may think and could come off very obviously. As H\u2019s wife, I can understand why S may be upset at finding out you decided not to use H. It could be some sort of validation on how S thinks you feel about H", "Wow NTA, your brother in law really demonstrated why he would have been calm and professional \ud83d\ude44 Sorry about the other relatives, though.", "NTA.  This is likely one of the largest financial transactions you will make in your life.  And it\u2019s an intimate, highly personal process that requires a lot of time and trust.  Realtors have keys to your house, know a lot about your financial situation etc. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to GIVE business to your friends and family, it\u2019s a choice, or they can EARN your business by showing their skill and trust.

As you said \u201cHe has a good business and is very successful\u201d. So there was no need for you to do business with them as they can handle themselves. \n\nAnd if your husband was able to get over it , your sister could\u2019ve to, but I think because of these past issues you guys had are the reason she turned it into a big problem just to spite you. \n\nI believe it best for you try to defend yourself with your family and say your piece and try to find out what she said to sort it out or invite your sister to talk it out and try to see how that helps.", "So the Husband has a very successful business and is himself not bothered you didn't use him to sell your house (presumably because he's busy with his successful business) but your Sister is screwing about it and making up stuff to tell the rest of your family, who have solely on her word cut off all communication?

Can u explain to me", "That\u2019s what my husband said too. I\u2019ve been reviewing her behavior over the years and it\u2019s definitely helping me realize some things I never noticed before.
