Wouldn\u2019t you be a little concerned too?", "Those law enforcement databases keep track of who does searches on whom when they\u2019re accessed. What was done was illegal. Call a lawyer have whoever did it fired or reprimanded and your bf can sue for violating his rights. Call your parents apologize.. tell them they may be right can you see what they have.. run off with the paperwork for proof. Find out how they got them etc\u2026 as evidence.

Good for you.", "As someone whose family did this, it is the ultimate form of disrespect.  They just confirmed they A) don\u2019t trust you to look out for yourself B) that he wouldn\u2019t have told you and C) they believe it was their business if the first place.  Don\u2019t invite them to the wedding", "Yep. Perfect answer to the parents: \"Worry about your own criminal wrongdoings last week, not fianc\u00e9's from nearly a decade ago while he was kicked onto the street.\"", "Where did OP say anything about the records being sealed?!?\n\nLet's not go crazy about facts not even entered into evidence.", "Fun fact, juvinile records aren't \"sealed\", just because they're juvinile records. Juvinile records are going to show up in most background checks, UNLESS sealed by a judge's orders. I used to routinely run background checks on visitors to a secure area ( anyone visiting had to agree to a background check ) and could almost always see charges and dispositions from a juvinile court.", "Agreed, this smells highly illegal, on top of being a catastrophic breach of privacy. Someone has clearly abused their power and they need to be removed from their position before they do it again.", "Your a bellend and the parents and their law enforcement friend, committed a crime", "Yeah because loving someone who was abused and exploited as a child is a mistake \ud83d\ude44", "Wow, your a real piece of work", "It's none of your business and it's none of theirs. This happened while they were a child, alone, on the streets. Would you like to be held up for shame for things you did when you were a kid? I bet you did some sh\\*t because all kids do to some degree. You can't go back and fix the past and neither can they. All they can do is move forward and be the best they can be. That's all anyone can do. \n\nIf the parents found juvie records, and that's all they found, then obviously they've done a lot of work to get back on track. That's why the parents are ridiculous. How long does it take to prove you're a decent person? One decade? Two? And I don't buy that the parents were just \"worried\". NOPE.", "What exactly about being bisexual do you think would \"mean in your married future\"???", "biphobic much", "Even if I disagree with it, your first paragraph was reasonable and sound. Your second half is just bigotry. Wtf does him being bi have to do with future divorce? 0. Absolutely fucking 0.", "What exactly does him being bi mean for their married future? Please explain this to me.", "He was a child who was exploited.", "People automatically assume that juvie records are \"sealed\", like they're placed in an envelope that no one can open without a court order. That is not the case the majority of the time. If a judge doens't order the record sealed, it can usually be found by running a basic criminal records check.", "Thanks for this helpful info - but isn\u2019t it still not OK to look up someone\u2019s records and give the information to a friend if you\u2019re a police officer?", "It's probably not illegal. Routine background checks include juvinile records UNLESS sealed by a judge. They are not automatically sealed just because the defendent was under 18. I've literally run hundreds of criminal records checks for visitors to a secured building ( that they agree to when asking for entrance ), and almost always could see juvinile charges and dispositions.", "Meh. That wouldn\u2019t be the hill to die on. They are going to do stupid illegal stuff no matter what and it distracts from the other issues she can manage.", "I\u2019m not even sure what you\u2019re saying", "Statistically, yes. It could work, but likely won\u2019t.", "But again, you don\u2019t know what they found, or how they found it, or what that person\u2019s crimes may or may not have been. As I already pointed out, different states can have very different laws regarding the sealing and expungements of juvenile criminal records. And getting court records sealed doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot of things can\u2019t be found out in a million different ways other than police records. In some states, you can only have your juvenile records sealed after 5 years has gone by, and in some states you have to make a request to get them sealed at all. There isn\u2019t some universal law for that sort of thing. Further, you have no idea the age this person was when committing these alleged crimes, and you don\u2019t know how long of a rap sheet they might have. And to be quite honest, it\u2019s entirely possible that OP may not know the real stories herself.", "And shes their child. And they are making sure she isnt being exploited.", "state attorney general would be a good place to start", "Well, you're disgusting.", "It sounds like you're the one who would be a poor parent if you're willing to give up on somebody because they've been abused.

Even working in something like medicine or finance leaking information about clients is a huge deal that can easily lead to massive fines or potentially land you in jail.\n\nThis goes way beyond that, if the fianc\u00e9 was actually 16 or under it is extremely likely the court records were sealed. Plus the fianc\u00e9 was a formerly homeless minor that managed to escape addiction, get into college, and now just wants to move forward in life and get married.

Are you saying I\u2019m wrong about the likelihood of failure?", "Whether records are sealed or not, and how, can vary a lot state to state, and some records are ineligible to be sealed or expunged, even for juvenile crimes. Further, even if they\u2019re expunged from court or police checks, they aren\u2019t necessarily gone from background check company databases, or old news stories, or all manner of other sources. There are whole firms that do nothing but dig up that sort of thing on people, and they\u2019re amazingly effective, especially for people who have lived more of their lives in the internet age.", "Why would you assume their alleged crimes were committed at age 13, or that their being queer has any bearing on the crimes they allegedly committed?", "It is, but not the way you'd think.", "Actually, no, it is not likely that the records were sealed. I ran background checks for visitors to a secured area ( that they agreed to ) and could almost always see juvinile charges and dispositions. Records usually needed a judge's orders to be sealed.", "Sure, you cite some sources that prove that victims of child abuse who have sought therapy and worked through their trauma can't be in successful romantic relationships.", "first off he's bi not gay and he did what he had to do to survive as a literal child.

I would be incredibly proud of him for getting out of that situation.", "What do you mean by \u201csecured area\u201d? It\u2019s fairly common for Judges to expunge or seal records for people 16 or under. The severity of the crime and the specific state are obviously going to play a large part in the decision though.\n\nA 16 year old that killed someone in a drive by and a 15 year old that got caught with a gram of weed aren\u2019t going to be treated the same by the courts. There are law enforcement (probably at the state or federal level) that can sometimes still view records that are sealed, but leaking information that isn\u2019t even related to an investigation can pretty easily land those same people in prison.", "No. Judges, attorneys can be considered part of the criminal justice system but they are NOT law enforcement\u2026\n\nOfficers of the court may include entities such as judges, lawyers, and paralegals, and should not be confused with court officers, the law enforcement personnel who work in courts.", "Attorneys, judges and social workers are all not part of law-enforcement. Where did you get that erroneous information?", "Sigh. That\u2019s a very specific study you\u2019re requesting. I\u2019m saying abuse victims have higher than average failure rates in relationships, and the average is about 50% failure. You seem determined to miss my point. \n\nYou win.
