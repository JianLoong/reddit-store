I even had requested less hours and adjusted my schedule to make sure my husband or I could be home with her and the kids always. I have more leniency with my job so I\u2019m her main care giver the past few days and I help her bathe and get dressed.

She said no and that it was super rude of me to come into her space n grab her laundry, and that I should understand boundaries. I told her that\u2019s why she was staying in my house, so we could take care of her. She called me a b*ch and that I only agreed to take care of her so I\u2019d look like a good person and not to touch her stuff again. \n\n\nI brought this up to my husband and he backed me up and said that\u2019s what she was here for, for us to take care of her.

But keep in mind that this is probably very difficult for her. \n\nIf you and your husband have a good functioning relationship, it's probably very hard for her to watch that especially while disabled and being in a position where \"her replacement\" is now taking care of her. That would probably be very difficult for most people. \n\nMost people when they are around their exes and their partners put all of their shields up, and she's in a position where she can't. She literally has to be in front of you naked.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. I can practically see your halo from here. But to keep the peace and since she has so little control over her life right now, I suppose asking her before touching her laundry is doable. (Or better yet, maybe one of her children can help with her laundry.) Gratitude would be nice but for now you\u2019ll have to get it from us here on Reddit. You and your husband are amazing.", "NTA\n\nI am not about to make excuses for ex, but I will say that sometimes stress, pain, and feelings of helplessness/vulnerability can express in really dumb, hostile ways. Especially if she's been on any type of pain killers during her recovery. You know all that already, though.\n\n\nYou're a peach for doing what you are doing and I'm sorry that she's being a butthole about it. \n\n\nSometimes people just aren't grateful and it sucks.", "NTA  \n\n\nI Imagine she's feeling bitter and small, needing to be cared for by you and her ex, you're being super practical/helpful about this given the circumstances.   \n\n\nsorry she's clowning on you, good luck OP, maybe she'll apologize knowing she lashed out for basically no reason.", "Unless she's going to get up and wash them herself, NTA.", "Whoa wow NTA. I can understand her wanting some sense of privacy given that she\u2019s completely helpless, but the way she talked to you about it crossed the line.", "NTA of course. You are being incredibly generous and I'm sure it's an awkward situation for everyone. She sounds like she overreacted but I'm sure she is in a lot of pain and incredibly frustrated about her current inability to do things for herself. I would just tell her you didn't realize that taking her laundry without asking would make her feel that way and let her know you'll ask her in the future. No need to apologize though.", "NTA but stop letting her stay with you", "NTA- I want to start off with, in no way should she have escalated the situation or that it required her to get so heated. But it might be coming from a place of control. Everything as of right now is out of her control especially considering bathing herself which is very intimate. I think she\u2019s definitely in the wrong with the way she reacted but I can understand why she might want that little bit of control of wanting you to ask first. I personally wash my items very specifically so I would also be upset not to mention losing all other control in my life. I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong by any means for wanting to help but maybe try to see it from that side of things?", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have called you a b*tch when you were just trying to help. Now you know not to do her laundry.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou and your husband need to have a talk with her TOGETHER. Explain to her that you have offered to be her caretakers and she accepted. If she had these \"boundaries\" she needed to state them upfront, but getting so angry at you for trying to do a nice thing and speaking to you the way she did is unacceptable. If your help with her care and her children is not appreciated, she is welcome to find someone else to do it.", "NTA. Some people don't think before they speak. But in her position not the move to make. Nice you're trying to make the best of bad.", "NTA\u2026. She may be on medications for the pain that is making her feel off, but if she doesn\u2019t apologize later- don\u2019t feel like you have to.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a difficult situation for everyone and she is probably not feeling great being looked after her ex-husbands wife when in a vulnerable situation.\n\nThat being said you are not doing anything wrong. \n\nCan't help to feel that there is more to this story though.", "NTA. I'd be realllly tempted to move her ungrateful ass back home.", "NTA. Don't do her laundry again. If hubby has time and wants to, fine. If not, she can wear dirty clothes. You're much nicer than I am. After someone called me a b\\*ch for helping them, I would be telling them to make other arrangements.", "Wow, I\u2019m way too petty for this type of s$&t. My knee jerk reaction would be say to kick her out of your house. I get it, she\u2019s in an awkward situation, probably in pain and feeling helpless. Doesn\u2019t excuse how she spoke to you though. She doesn\u2019t have space in the house you own, she\u2019s nothing but a guest. NTA", "NTA. Of course not. With that attitude, she can go back home and take care of herself.", "NTA. I really just can't understand calling the person housing and caring for you any names or acting so ungrateful when you were clearly just trying to help. I hope you and your husband are planning on talking to her about this so she doesn't continue to act so entitled and unappreciative.", "Omg NTA how ungrateful is this woman?? She could have just said \"oh no need to do my laundry but thank you so much anyway\".\n\nYou are doing the kind thing but if this behavior continues then maybe she can take care of herself.", "NTA and honestly after that I would kick her out and tell her she\u2019s on her own from now on since you guys were going her a huge favour and she\u2019s being a b***h cause you touched her laundry", "op=NTA\n\nbut that is SOME ungrateful woman.  She's and AH in this situation.", "NTA.  If she doesn't like the care she's getting in your home perhaps she should seek it somewhere else.", "Let her keep wearing the same dirty clothes.  Or I would tell her she is welcome to go back home, sooner rather than later.", "NTA\u2026.get a wheel chair and roll her ungrateful ass home.", "NTA. You're already doing so much just to help her. She should just be grateful that she isn't having to do her own laundry.", "Your husband\u2019s ex seems ungrateful and frankly unhinged. Since she obviously doesn\u2019t want your help, you and your husband should take her at her word. I\u2019m sure she will be happy to complete her recovery elsewhere. NTA.", "NTA \n\nKick her rude ass out of your home. You are doing a favor and rearranging your life to accommodate her and she acts like that. No, kick her tf out of your home.", "NTA but I kinda disagree with everyone saying she\u2019s feeling vulnerable and that\u2019s why she did it. I have no doubt she\u2019s feeling vulnerable, but I think she liked her ex taking care of her.(maybe in a way she wanted while they were married.) she could even pretend that they were married again and he\u2019s being the perfect husband to her. And you were just the nurse that did the grunt work. That image shattered when you picked up her laundry. All of sudden she was put back into reality that this isn\u2019t her home, he isn\u2019t her husband anymore, and y\u2019all are doing this because she needs someone medically qualified to care for her. Between the accident, surgeries, and recovery she hasn\u2019t had time to deal with the very real trauma of the accident, surgeries, and recovery.", "NTA maybe try and see how to get her out of your place quicker. Shes hurt and venerable  but she doesn\u2019t get to treat you like that. If she doesn\u2019t apologize you guys need to make sure she\u2019s back home as soon as she can be, keep the kids longer so it\u2019s less stress on her", "NAH. You\u2019re an adult and sound incredibly generous so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re capable of some empathy. Your husband\u2019s ex wife has been in a serious accident and forced to rely on the kindness of an ex that you\u2019ve outright stated she\u2019s only on civil terms with. Imagine being in her shoes- I couldn\u2019t at all. I\u2019d probably rather suffer if I didn\u2019t have children to consider. Yes you could hope for her to be grateful but right now she sounds like she\u2019s immobile probably in pain, stuck relying on the kindness of an ex, and unable to care for herself let alone her own children. I think she has the right to be a bit bitter. If you\u2019re a cna- you (honestly your husband too) should be well acquainted with patients at times becoming rude due to their own frustration. Doesn\u2019t make it okay but I don\u2019t see the harm in apologizing and asking if she\u2019d like her clothes washed before touching them from now on. If she says no, you have less clothes to wash. \n\nHer privacy is violated by the circumstances she\u2019s found herself in enough- it costs you nothing to let her save face and ask first before touching her belongings. She\u2019s not an ah to be frustrated and you\u2019re not an ah to be kind.", "Lots of folks saying \u201cnot the asshole\u201d, but YTA. I\u2019ve know women that are VERY ashamed of the bleaching that happens to their underwear. I know it is stupid (and so do they) but it\u2019s something to run by them first.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she can't get up and do it herself, it doesn't make sense for her to get pissed off at you for doing it. Sounds like she's either taking her frustrations out on you or she's embarrassed about something. I'm sure it isn't comfortable being taken care of by someone you don't get along with very well, but she accepted your offer of help, and she needs to deal.
