I even had requested less hours and adjusted my schedule to make sure my husband or I could be home with her and the kids always. I have more leniency with my job so I\u2019m her main care giver the past few days and I help her bathe and get dressed. My husband handles the lest invasive things. \n\nI was doing the laundry which my husband has been doing for her and grabbed some of her clothes and put them in.

She said no and that it was super rude of me to come into her space n grab her laundry, and that I should understand boundaries. I told her that\u2019s why she was staying in my house, so we could take care of her. She called me a b*ch and that I only agreed to take care of her so I\u2019d look like a good person and not to touch her stuff again. \n\n\nI brought this up to my husband and he backed me up and said that\u2019s what she was here for, for us to take care of her.

But keep in mind that this is probably very difficult for her. \n\nIf you and your husband have a good functioning relationship, it's probably very hard for her to watch that especially while disabled and being in a position where \"her replacement\" is now taking care of her. That would probably be very difficult for most people. \n\nMost people when they are around their exes and their partners put all of their shields up, and she's in a position where she can't. She literally has to be in front of you naked.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. I can practically see your halo from here. But to keep the peace and since she has so little control over her life right now, I suppose asking her before touching her laundry is doable. (Or better yet, maybe one of her children can help with her laundry.) Gratitude would be nice but for now you\u2019ll have to get it from us here on Reddit. You and your husband are amazing.", "NTA\n\nI am not about to make excuses for ex, but I will say that sometimes stress, pain, and feelings of helplessness/vulnerability can express in really dumb, hostile ways. Especially if she's been on any type of pain killers during her recovery. You know all that already, though.\n\n\nYou're a peach for doing what you are doing and I'm sorry that she's being a butthole about it. \n\n\nSometimes people just aren't grateful and it sucks.", "NTA  \n\n\nI Imagine she's feeling bitter and small, needing to be cared for by you and her ex, you're being super practical/helpful about this given the circumstances.   \n\n\nsorry she's clowning on you, good luck OP, maybe she'll apologize knowing she lashed out for basically no reason.", "Unless she's going to get up and wash them herself, NTA.", "Whoa wow NTA. I can understand her wanting some sense of privacy given that she\u2019s completely helpless, but the way she talked to you about it crossed the line.", "NTA of course. You are being incredibly generous and I'm sure it's an awkward situation for everyone. She sounds like she overreacted but I'm sure she is in a lot of pain and incredibly frustrated about her current inability to do things for herself. I would just tell her you didn't realize that taking her laundry without asking would make her feel that way and let her know you'll ask her in the future. No need to apologize though.", "NTA but stop letting her stay with you", "NTA- I want to start off with, in no way should she have escalated the situation or that it required her to get so heated. But it might be coming from a place of control. Everything as of right now is out of her control especially considering bathing herself which is very intimate. I think she\u2019s definitely in the wrong with the way she reacted but I can understand why she might want that little bit of control of wanting you to ask first. I personally wash my items very specifically so I would also be upset not to mention losing all other control in my life. I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong by any means for wanting to help but maybe try to see it from that side of things?", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have called you a b*tch when you were just trying to help. Now you know not to do her laundry.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou and your husband need to have a talk with her TOGETHER. Explain to her that you have offered to be her caretakers and she accepted. If she had these \"boundaries\" she needed to state them upfront, but getting so angry at you for trying to do a nice thing and speaking to you the way she did is unacceptable. If your help with her care and her children is not appreciated, she is welcome to find someone else to do it.", "NTA. Some people don't think before they speak. But in her position not the move to make. Nice you're trying to make the best of bad.", "NTA\u2026. She may be on medications for the pain that is making her feel off, but if she doesn\u2019t apologize later- don\u2019t feel like you have to.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a difficult situation for everyone and she is probably not feeling great being looked after her ex-husbands wife when in a vulnerable situation.\n\nThat being said you are not doing anything wrong. \n\nCan't help to feel that there is more to this story though.", "NTA. I'd be realllly tempted to move her ungrateful ass back home.", "NTA. Don't do her laundry again. If hubby has time and wants to, fine. If not, she can wear dirty clothes. You're much nicer than I am. After someone called me a b\\*ch for helping them, I would be telling them to make other arrangements.", "Wow, I\u2019m way too petty for this type of s$&t. My knee jerk reaction would be say to kick her out of your house. I get it, she\u2019s in an awkward situation, probably in pain and feeling helpless. Doesn\u2019t excuse how she spoke to you though. She doesn\u2019t have space in the house you own, she\u2019s nothing but a guest. NTA", "NTA. Of course not. With that attitude, she can go back home and take care of herself.", "NTA. I really just can't understand calling the person housing and caring for you any names or acting so ungrateful when you were clearly just trying to help. I hope you and your husband are planning on talking to her about this so she doesn't continue to act so entitled and unappreciative.", "Omg NTA how ungrateful is this woman?? She could have just said \"oh no need to do my laundry but thank you so much anyway\".\n\nYou are doing the kind thing but if this behavior continues then maybe she can take care of herself.", "NTA and honestly after that I would kick her out and tell her she\u2019s on her own from now on since you guys were going her a huge favour and she\u2019s being a b***h cause you touched her laundry", "op=NTA\n\nbut that is SOME ungrateful woman.  She's and AH in this situation.", "NTA.  If she doesn't like the care she's getting in your home perhaps she should seek it somewhere else.", "Let her keep wearing the same dirty clothes.  Or I would tell her she is welcome to go back home, sooner rather than later.", "NTA\u2026.get a wheel chair and roll her ungrateful ass home.", "NTA. You're already doing so much just to help her. She should just be grateful that she isn't having to do her own laundry.", "Your husband\u2019s ex seems ungrateful and frankly unhinged. Since she obviously doesn\u2019t want your help, you and your husband should take her at her word. I\u2019m sure she will be happy to complete her recovery elsewhere. NTA.", "NTA \n\nKick her rude ass out of your home. You are doing a favor and rearranging your life to accommodate her and she acts like that. No, kick her tf out of your home.", "NTA but I kinda disagree with everyone saying she\u2019s feeling vulnerable and that\u2019s why she did it. I have no doubt she\u2019s feeling vulnerable, but I think she liked her ex taking care of her.(maybe in a way she wanted while they were married.) she could even pretend that they were married again and he\u2019s being the perfect husband to her. And you were just the nurse that did the grunt work. That image shattered when you picked up her laundry. All of sudden she was put back into reality that this isn\u2019t her home, he isn\u2019t her husband anymore, and y\u2019all are doing this because she needs someone medically qualified to care for her. Between the accident, surgeries, and recovery she hasn\u2019t had time to deal with the very real trauma of the accident, surgeries, and recovery.", "NTA maybe try and see how to get her out of your place quicker. Shes hurt and venerable  but she doesn\u2019t get to treat you like that. If she doesn\u2019t apologize you guys need to make sure she\u2019s back home as soon as she can be, keep the kids longer so it\u2019s less stress on her", "NAH. You\u2019re an adult and sound incredibly generous so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re capable of some empathy. Your husband\u2019s ex wife has been in a serious accident and forced to rely on the kindness of an ex that you\u2019ve outright stated she\u2019s only on civil terms with. Imagine being in her shoes- I couldn\u2019t at all. I\u2019d probably rather suffer if I didn\u2019t have children to consider. Yes you could hope for her to be grateful but right now she sounds like she\u2019s immobile probably in pain, stuck relying on the kindness of an ex, and unable to care for herself let alone her own children. I think she has the right to be a bit bitter. If you\u2019re a cna- you (honestly your husband too) should be well acquainted with patients at times becoming rude due to their own frustration. Doesn\u2019t make it okay but I don\u2019t see the harm in apologizing and asking if she\u2019d like her clothes washed before touching them from now on. If she says no, you have less clothes to wash. \n\nHer privacy is violated by the circumstances she\u2019s found herself in enough- it costs you nothing to let her save face and ask first before touching her belongings. She\u2019s not an ah to be frustrated and you\u2019re not an ah to be kind.", "Lots of folks saying \u201cnot the asshole\u201d, but YTA. I\u2019ve know women that are VERY ashamed of the bleaching that happens to their underwear. I know it is stupid (and so do they) but it\u2019s something to run by them first.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The ex acted badly which doesn't make her sound very grateful and that must feel very galling to OP after all she's doing. \n\nYou bring an interesting view from your experience. It must be very frightening to be at the mercy of your ex and his wife and feel no control. I'm *not* excusing her lashing out but it does sound like a good idea to allow her a feeling of dignity and ask before touching her things.", "Found the Ex wife lol", "Exactly. If she can't get up and do it herself, it doesn't make sense for her to get pissed off at you for doing it. Sounds like she's either taking her frustrations out on you or she's embarrassed about something. I'm sure it isn't comfortable being taken care of by someone you don't get along with very well, but she accepted your offer of help, and she needs to deal. If she can't do that, she needs to make other arrangements for her care.", "You should probably make your own judgement then.

She may have been having a bad day, if this is the only instance I say don\u2019t take it to heart.

People act a little cuckoo when they feel like they have no control over anything. If she really doesn\u2019t want you to do her laundry, offer to help her find someone to do it for her at her expense. Then she will maybe feel like it was her choice. You are being so generous by helping her.", "NTA.  You are a fucking Saint IMO.", "NTA. I can't decide if her pain meds have stopped working or are working way too well. She sounds a bit delusional. Maybe she's having a hard time with feeling helpless. In any case, you're amazing.", "NTA but she probably feels so helpless and maybe embarrassed you washing her socks or whatever like she\u2019s a child. Let hubby do it.  Get her well and out of there. Stress won\u2019t help.", "NTA but - Through terrible circumstances the ex has lost all independence and luckily for her you have both been amazing putting grievances aside to care for her.  Having said that, it must be extremely hard for her to lose all privacy/dignity and the ability to make choices for herself.  It\u2019s probably not even about the washing.", "NTA\n\nBut here's maybe another perspective.\n\nYou know when you're going to see the obgyn, and you hide your underwear after you get changed? Even though they're literally going to be all up in your business?\n\nIt's a small bit of control over what you do with intimate items like underwear, that they may be seeing your body, but dammit if they're going to see your choice of undies. They literally don't give a flying squirrel about your undies, but for us, it's a big deal to hide it or choose where we place it after we undress.\n\nYou sound like you're doing an amazing job. But this is one thing she can choose - who she'd prefer to do her laundry. The person bathing her already has so much access to her body, she might just want to exercise some choice, some degree of separation for a thing that seems mindlessly minor to you. \n\nYou didn't mean to cross any boundaries.

Now that you know it's a boundary, respect it, and move on. You are a saint for taking care of her, but I imagine it is very hard for her to be in this position too, and how vulnerable it must make her feel.", "NTA. She's an ass.

She can fend for herself", "NTA", "NTA you deserve all the appreciation in the world for what you're doing right now!  I can only imagine that having to be bathed by your ex husband's new wife would make someone feel lower than low. She's lashing out and trying to control what little she can with the added bonus of taking you down a notch. Ignore her and keep your karma bank overflowing", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA NTA NTA. \nBut you knew that right?????\n\nHer attitude and lashing out are understandable. But not excusable.  \n\nYes she probably feels like she has no control.   Yes she's probably in a lot of pain.  And yes she maybe feeling jealous. All of it.  Totally understandable.  \n\nBUUUUUUUUT!\n\n>She said no and that it was super rude of me to come into her space n grab her laundry, and that I should understand boundaries. \n\nAND SHE SHOULD PRACTICE CIVILITY.

He needs to make sure she can care for them.  You don't owe her anything. If she has a problem with you helping her that's her problem to solve.  He can kick her out to heal on her own and keep the kids so she can heal without the responsibilities or she can mend in your home with caveat that she stays civil.  \n\nYou and your husband can be kind. And firm.  Understand she's coming from a place of pain so give her the grace but don't be a doormat. You deserve better.", "I'd drop her and the laundry off at the corner. I've been a full-time caregiver, and it sucks \n\nNTA\n\nI think ur a superhero for taking her in.", "NTA. She's just being a b**** for whatever reason. Maybe she's jealous, maybe she feels indebted and is striking out at you guys or at least you. Fine don't do her laundry anymore she can stink.", "NTA - You don't deserve this treatment in your own home when you are just trying to help a woman in need. I can understand she's in a vulnerable situation and just went through a lot of trauma so that's probably where this is all coming from, it's still no excuse to mistreat anyone, specially those trying to help her recovery.", "When did she and your husband get divorced? Still fresh wounds?", "NTA but she's lost control of almost everything, and is dependent on her ex and his new wife. That's why she's lashing out. I don't know how she expects her laundry to get done but let her have control of that one thing if it makes her feel better. It's not worth fighting over. You're an angel.", "NTA.  And you\u2019re a better person than I.", "NTA but with that attitude send her to the streets!", "If she wants her privacy, she can go  back to her own house. What a loon.", "NTA. Get her out of your house. She can turn around and sue you both for abuse, if she chooses to. You've put yourself at great liability. She has told you she doesn't want you touching her belongings or entering her space. In your house. This is bad and you need to nip this in the bud. She can figure out her own care, without being in your home.", "NTA She probably feels she has no control of her life, and is trying to find something she can control.", "NTA but I really can\u2019t imagine how difficult it must be to be in her shoes. She must feel completely out of control and it\u2019s gotta be tough there\u2019s no one in her life to care for her but y\u2019all. Not trying to make excuses, she was clearly out of like and you are wonderful, I think it\u2019s just a tough situation all around.", "NTA, now you see why they broke up.

Better than most. Nta!", "NTA", "NAH- you are obviously not an asshole in this situation but I also have a hard time calling someone recovering from such a traumatic experience one.

The worst person ever and normally him and I get along great. But it sounds like she just wanted to pick a fight with you.", "Yes! Came here to say this! Being ill and having to rely on other people is emotionally exhausting, let alone when those caregivers are your ex-husband and his new wife. I could understand shame and embarrassment manifesting itself in less than ideal ways. Still, NTA but maybe you need to have a new conversation about boundaries so that everyone is on the same page. It sounds like you're ruminating about this, OP, so be easy on yourself, and I'm glad you have a partner who is supportive!", "Thus is a really good point. She doesn't have control over anything at the moment, but she can control her belongings. Did she do it in a very rude way, yes, but if she is in pain and you 2 don't usually get along anyway, she probably wasn't thinking about how to express her feelings in a more constructive way.", "Loool best comment yet", "I agree with this assessment. Both OP and her husband need to speak with the patient together and stress that she is exactly that. She is, essentially, THEIR patient...while sitting close together and holding hands. I have a feeling that his ex-wife will quickly find someone that can take care of her in her own home.", "I think this is the actual truth of the situation.", "This is the comment I was looking for, it seems exactly that. They need to have a conversation with her to clarify the relationship that she\u2019s essentially their patient and that is all. If anything, he can step back to establish better boundaries.", "Right, exactly. NAH Is my call.", "This is the one of two decent replies here. She is going through something hard and is trying to keep some shred of dignity. Absolutely NAH.", "To be fair I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing it maliciously or anything. I just think that she went through a LOT and it came with a LOT of trauma that she hasn\u2019t had the time to reflect on. I think it was confusing to her having him so close after however long, and then it was comforting because he was familiar and their family was technically \u201cback together.\u201d It\u2019s like when a woman in an abusive relationship and then has a male therapist that helps them move on from the trauma. Only to end up having misplaced feelings for that therapist. I know there\u2019s a technical term for it. I just don\u2019t know what it is lol.", "I\u2019m just relieved someone else gets where I\u2019m coming from. If she were just housing the ex wife, then yeah I understand. However, the seriousness of her injuries add a nuance to her behavior that I don\u2019t think should or can be ignored. I wouldn\u2019t want to be any of them in this situation. Some situations are NAH and that\u2019s definitely the case here for me.", "Right? Don't bite the hand that feeds you. \n\nGlad this is not me, I would have a convo and allow her to leave if this was \"invasive\". \n\nYou ARE a Saint, OP. And definitely NTA.", "Yup. I have been sick and I have helped sick people. Both are hard in different ways."]}
