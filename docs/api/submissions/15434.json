We are somewhat last minute people but we did manage to make a few plans with some friends a few weeks in advance. We have the entire weekend to make plans with family and anybody else, so we set out times that we're open to do something with our mom. \n\nHere comes the issue: we told her what our plans would be, to have lunch on our birthday in an area that was pretty much right near where our plans for that evening were, and we would just hang out there basically all day, as there is lots to do. Mom states she is not available as she decided to observe a class that afternoon. That is fine, so we off lunch or dinner the next day, but she will be at a game. Again, that's fine, we have the day before our birthday open to have a late lunch or early dinner. She gets off of work that day and tells us she is tired from the working early all week, but that she might be free after 6 pm. We already had plans that evening around that time so we tell her we can't do it then, but maybe after the game she attends the following day we could do dinner because it will be early enough in the day. She states she will probably be tired. \n\nSo we get a message that basically states \"well I guess we will do something next year then, since I am not important enough to do anything with. You chose not to spend Easter with me and I am hurt about that, especially since I moved back closer to home. I hope you remember I brought you into this world but have been treated with nothing but disrespect. I hope you take care and have a nice life.\"\n\nThis is a very summarized version but that is the gist of what she had to say. She always make some issue or event always about her. Literally we did not know how to respond or what to even say, as this is not the first, nor second time she has said things like this is in the past. Apologies mean nothing to her so we didn't even want to waste our time. \n\nAll of our friends say we were in the right, we don't respond to it, but WIBTA if I really did just ignore it and take her for her word this time and just have a nice life, or at least go low contact til she calms down?\n\nNote: we are in our late 20s with jobs and grad school, not married and no kids though, but grown adults with adult schedules. Life gets hard to schedule now. I only add this to say that we aren't young teens or something that might still require input from our parents/be punished, etc.\n\nETA: I do want to add, not that it should matter, but I definitely think this is boiling down to past transgressions, like not spending Mother's Day with her last year, even though she lived 4 hours away and was supposed to come to us and ended up not, and Easter this year. She chose not to come to her own family's house since she just got remarried and her family can be tough on new significant others, but blamed us for going there instead of with her, when I called and asked her what she was doing because I thought we were going to see her after her family.

If she accepts, there\u2019s reconciliation. \n\nPlaying her game of \u201chave a nice life\u201d validates her false narrative and absolves her of having to hear your side and meet you half way. My therapist used to call this process of hearing her pain but instead of meeting her unreasonable expectation that you are the one at fault, offering solutions, as \u201ckilling them with kindness\u201d\u2026 despite her incorrect assessment of what happened, you are unconditionally loving her and doing things to show you do by offering ways to meet up.", "You should edit your OP with this info so people have it when voting."]}
