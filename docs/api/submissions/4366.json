And he's a GOOD LISTENER on top of it? That's it, lock him away.\n\n>Seven months ago my daughter who is now a senior started to date a guy who wasn\u2019t someone I envisioned with her.\n\nHonestly, this says it all. YTA, big time. You can have a \"vision\" for her all you want, but ultimately it's her life and the harder you hold on and try to force her into this mold or \"vision\" you have, the further away you're going to push her. She's growing up, I suggest you do the same. YTA.\n\nETA: This kid actually sounds pretty awesome. From what you've written, he sounds well mannered and respectful of his gf's family, he hasn't interfered with her studies, he's athletic, good with people, and he's helping her open up to new experiences she probably wouldn't have had if she stuck to your \"vision\".", "YTA. You've been passing all sorts of judgement on your daughter and her boyfriend when it sounds like they're just having fun in a normal teenage relationship. If anything it's a good thing that she's coming out of her shell. I feel like you just don't want her to be in any sort of relationship at all.\n\n>speak only when she is spoken to\n\nAnd you're misogynistic too.", "YTA. It's normal for teenagers to be nervous when having dinner with their girlfriend's parents. It sounds like you're projecting all sorts of nefarious things on him. How does it make sense in your own head that you think he's both a dumb jock and someone who's capable of psychoanalyzing your every word?\n\nHe's likely a normal teenage boy and gives your daughter positive attention that she doesn't get from you. What kind of parent lists  \"would speak only when she is spoken to\" as a positive quality in a child? That says all sort of dire things about you as a human being that are probably going to lead to your child wanting to go no contact with you once she's an adult.\n\nIt sounds like she's a generally responsible child that is exploring her identity and trying new things (cheerleading). Your child is not going to make all the same conservative choices that you do in life forever, and you have to realize that she's nearly an adult and she needs to be able to navigate those choices safely.   \n\n\nThe really unfortunate thing here is that if she ever does do something risky and gets hurt, it will be 100% your fault for creating an environment where she isn't allowed to do normal teenage things and develop her independence without being morally censored. Kids who grow up in that kind of environment often have a very hard time telling the difference between things that seem exciting to them simply because their strict parents wouldn't let them do it and things that are genuinely dangerous. If you were parenting instead of running a puritanical dictatorship in your home, your kid would feel comfortable with you to help her navigate her choices. As it is, she's going to go it alone.", "YTA. Make sure she knows how to use a condom to keep from catching something (most somethings), and that she's on a long-term contraceptive, and then let her make her own mistakes. Sounds like she's having fun now. She's trying new things, trying new looks, dating someone different than usual, AND still getting good grades. She's even told you that this is why she is being sneaky. You haven't said a thing about him mistreating her, insulting or speaking down to her, using her, etc. so back off and let her be a teen and date and enjoy her life. You think it's a mistake? Well, it's her mistake to make. As long as she's not getting pregnant or getting abused, she gets to make it. And you COULD be wrong, too.", "Well soccer is a gateway sport, so...wait your complaints are he's a jock and popular? The nerve!\n\n>Though, she is still ahead in her studies.\n\nThen there's no problem. People change over time. People get infatuated. That's just how things work. She is almost an adult and won't be devoted to you anymore.\n\nYTA for the weird jealous tone throughout this.", "YTA. So all this person has done is, let me check my notes, not be a nerd. For a grown ass man to be so focused on labels and the popularity status of a teenager is cringe as fuck. Stop trying to dictate the lige you \"envisioned\" for your daughter before she realizes she can just be in this relationship without your consent and leaves you forever.", "YTA simply for the line \"only speak when spoken to,\" honestly. \n\nHave you seen Footloose? Dirty Dancing? Did you think Kevin Bacon and Patrick Swayze were the villains?", "YTA.   You don't seem to have a grasp of how teenagers \"work\".   Everything you describe sounds pretty normal for that age.   What isn't appropriate IMO is your banning him from dinner when he didn't do anything rude or obnoxious; he simply didn't socialize the way you think he should.", "It\u2019s pretty disgusting that one of the things like you liked about your daughter is that she only speaks when spoken too.

I've raised two children of my own and I can tell you that if you put her in the position of choosing, you will end up on the losing end.  You may not be crazy about her choices, but you need to begin respecting that she is no longer a young child under your thumb.  She will now speak, even if she hasn't been spoken to.  She is a young woman.  You are much better inviting him and taking the chances you can with getting to know him better.  You might even find that there ARE reasons he is a likable person!  But if you try pushing him out of the picture, she will chose to follow him and you will lose the bonds you've worked so hard to build.  Not a wise move, on your part.", ">speak only when she is spoken to. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nYTA.", "YTA, your daughter only speaking when spoken to isn\u2019t a positive trait.

Her boyfriend may have just been too nervous to say much before.", "YTA... Sounds like your daughter is acting like a 17 year old senior in HS. Oh the horror! It's called growing up and finding your own style. If she was not still doing well in school I would understand the concern. I am sure you were a regular chatterbox when you were 18 and having dinner with your GF's family. It sounds like dinner was incredibly uncomfortable and it instead of making him feel welcome you judged him the whole time.", "YTA -  Your daughter is no longer a child.  In a year's time, she'll be a legal adult and at that point, she will be responsible for her own decisions.  This boyfriend of hers is her first taste of that sort of independence.  You may not like him because he was quiet at dinner and is a \"typical jock\".  I am feeling you are projecting some sort of biases from your own past against someone you don't know.", "YTA.  At 17 your daughter isn\u2019t an adult but she is old enough to pick her friends and boyfriends.  And the more critical you are of the boyfriend the more attractive he will be to her.  And you have now done everything you can to insure your daughter will not have a lovely time at your party.  She will be angry and miserable and will do her best to make everyone else miserable.\n\nLook at what you are complaining about.  She\u2019s become a cheerleader and wears skirts you think are too short. And her boyfriend plays soccer and doesn\u2019t talk much.  Is she doing poorly at school?  You say she is doing well in her studies.  Is she doing drugs?  Drinking alcohol excessively?  Is she pregnant?  Is she dropping out of school?  You say she sneaks out to see her boyfriend.  Is that happening because you are trying to keep her from seeing him.\n\nYou have what sounds like a normal teenage daughter, who is well behaved and evidently studious.  She has a boyfriend you don\u2019t like because he is shy and likes soccer.  So what?  Unless you are intentionally trying to push her away from you, you are being a pretty poor parent.", "Yta. He is important to her. You are jealous because her attention is not on you. Assure her family will always be there for her. Teen romances seldom last.", "YTA, just keep pushing her further into his arms. This is gonna work out great for ya!", "YTA. This whole thing reads like you\u2019re bitter that you weren\u2019t popular in high school. Plenty of \u201cjocks\u201d are wonderful people, and plenty of \u201cnerds\u201d are total assholes. \n\nYour complaints about this guy are that he is into sports, is well-liked and popular, and is\u2026 not talkative at a family event where he knows no one but your daughter, and so is just listening and trying to size up the family dynamics? Wow, he sounds like a real monster. /s\n\nThe way you speak about your daughter is frankly alarming. You claim she only became a cheerleader to be more like some guy/solely to have a shared interest with him? Have you ever *seen* a high school cheer practice? The workouts those kids do are *intense*. If her heart wasn\u2019t in it, she wouldn\u2019t do it. You act like she has no agency in the matter. Praising the fact that she only spoke when spoken to? She\u2019s not your property, dude. She is an individual, with her own thoughts, feelings, and desires. She\u2019s not an extension of you. I\u2019m not even gonna touch the \u201cdevout\u201d bit, I get the feeling you\u2019re one of *those* Christian parents that give the whole religion a bad name. \n\nLet\u2019s say your weird, jealous-father instincts are right, and the boy is a bad egg. Teens rebel. I know high school was a long time ago, but surely you remember reading Romeo and Juliet? The harder you try to keep her from him, the faster she\u2019ll be running toward him and far away from you. And if he isn\u2019t a good guy (frankly nothing you\u2019ve said would indicate that, but I\u2019m being generous and humoring you here) you\u2019ve just pushed your beloved daughter into the arms of a bad man *and* made it seem like you won\u2019t be in her corner.

You sound pretty awful.", "YTA. She\u2019s still doing well at school and she\u2019s just doing what most teenagers do: trying new things to see what fits. She\u2019s developing independence.

Her attitude might just be a teenager thing, I know teenagers can be a handful. But most importantly, she seems happy? Isn\u2019t that what you want for her? If she\u2019s doing well in school AND is living a good life I think you should let her enjoy it.\n\nYou seem to not know the guy too well so you having a discussion about how she shouldn\u2019t be in that relationship is not fair to her. If you keep forcing them apart she\u2019ll just push you away. Be supportive, let her boyfriend go to the dinner and give him a chance, he might not be who you\u2019re expecting.\n\nYou mentioned he doesn\u2019t talk much, I remember the first time I was at my girlfriends house for dinner, I was very nervous and also barely spoke, but over time I\u2019m very comfortable with them and everything is really nice.\n\nGive him a chance.", "Yeah, we get it, you're still not over high school.

You know he likes sports- he may also have excellent grades. He is clearly smart enough to observe your actions carefully at dinner instead of slouching around on his phone.

She still getting good grades so he's not dragging her down in that way and it doesn't sound like he mistreat her.  Believe me my mom prayed for the day I broke up with my high school bf.

I was fine on it, and knowing exactly when the bleeding was going to happen certainly helped me plan my month. My best friend in college had terrible periods prior to going on hormonal birth control, and the contraception helped mitigate her worst symptoms. Everyone is different!\n\nCondoms, of course, every time, and without exception, until in a long-term relationship and ready to get pregnant.", "The copper IUD has no hormones\n\nETA the person I responded to originally claimed IUDs all are hormonal. They edited their comment once they were corrected.", "i know they work great for some people and that's awesome! there will always be side effects though. my only point is it's a terrible idea to force iuds on children when they are not wanted because they can and will do horrible things from weight gain to mood swings to erratic periods.\n\ni didn't know non hormonal iuds were available though i live in canada we don't have planned parenthood all we have are walk in clinics for sexual education and health.", "it still has side effects.", "I think they're fairly common (copper IUDs) in any North American OB/GYN medical practice because so many folks have a hard time with hormonal b.c.\n\nAlso, I don't think anyone in this thread means to force an IUD on a child, just to present it as an option to the young person (who will be an adult soon enough). \n\nSide effect from my use of hormonal contraception: clearer skin and no babies. Everything has side effects, including aspirin. Absolutely consult a medical professional before taking hormonal contraception, but caution over fear.", "9 minutes ago you didn't even know there were non-hormonal IUDs. Now you're an expert on the side effects?\n\nKnow what also has side effects? Pregnancy."]}
