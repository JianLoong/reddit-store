She started classes around 5 and has been in them consistently ever since. She\u2019s won competitions over the years and worked really hard to get into a dance school that ranks very highly in our state. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly a \u201cstage mom\u201d I just see it makes her happy and told her as long as she keeps her grades up I\u2019ll always be there to help make her dream happen. She plans to go to an academy in New York when she graduates and I really wanna see her make it there. \n\nSara started her new school about 4 months ago. At first everything was great she would come home exhausted but excited. After a few weeks she would start coming home just exhausted and moody or sometimes down on herself if she missed a count etc. I tried asking if everything was ok and she would just brush it off saying they\u2019re training extra hard for a competition or she\u2019s just trying to push herself more. \n\nLast week I was a bit early to pick up Sara after practice so I just sat in the parking lot and read. I noticed a girl run out the doors crying and heaving. I met her to make sure she was ok and not dehydrated or having an anxiety attack. She muttered \u201cMs. X is so evil\u201d and walked away. \n\nThe rest of the team started streaming out before I could go after her or ask what happened. Sara got into the car looking a bit shaken. I asked if anything happened I should know about and she said no. I asked if Ms. X ever yells or hurts any one and she shook her head and stayed quiet the rest of the ride. \n\nI got a recorder that night and hid it in Sara\u2019s gym bag and turned it on when I handed her the bag while dropping her off hoping that it would pick up something since they\u2019re usually left along the wall in the same room they dance in. When she got home the next day I took it out and listened. All was normal until I heard what sounded like someone falling and Ms. X berating the girl. Calling her horrible names and such. Later I even heard Ms. X tell a girl to lose weight or she\u2019s done and she doesn\u2019t care \u201chow it happens\u201d. \n\nObviously I told Sara she would not be going back and we will find a new place. I also sent an anonymous email to the board Ms. X is certified through and just got a basic \u201cwe\u2019ll look into it\u201d response. \n\nSara flipped her lid freaking out saying her future is over and Ms. X was preparing them for the real world and I\u2019ll never understand. She said she\u2019ll never be one of the best now. Just full meltdown I\u2019ve never seen before. It scared me and made me double down because in my head this proves she had way too much pressure on her and none of it was healthy for her. \n\nHer dad says I should let her go back. I argued we can afford a school just as nice or even better so it shouldn\u2019t matter in the long run. Sara barely looks at me. Should I have let her stay and just watch her closely?

It happens any kind of abusive relationship but it's often best recognized in abusive romantic relationships. This teacher is isolating her students and making them dependant on her, so she can continue to abuse them. They'll keep coming back, they'll keep tolerating her abuse, because they believe her when she tells them she's the only key to their success. She'll make damn sure they believe they'll never be anything without her, that every other teacher is wrong and awful at what they do. She probably also tells them they shouldn't be friends with kids from other studios.\n\nYou're doing the right thing. There are plenty of good, great, *better* teachers out there that don't use abusive methods. But seriously, you need to know that this is abuse and it is just as real and just as harmful for a dance teacher to do this to your kid as it would be for a boyfriend. NTA.", "NTA!

You are most definitely NTA and I\u2019m gonna share a story from when I was in high school because I wish someone would\u2019ve gotten me out. I was in band for 7 years and was in almost every music group on campus because I was so committed to it. The directors, however, were some of the worst people I\u2019ve ever encountered. They were both women, for context, and were incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive, as well as sometimes being borderline physically abusive (there were rumors involving physical abuse as to why the second director was transferred to our school my freshman year). They put all of us down constantly and it was an extremely toxic environment. I\u2019m in my mid 20s now and I know a girl two years older than me who is still in therapy to this day because of what went on in that program in the name of \u201cperfection.\u201d We were all so brainwashed by this system that we didn\u2019t ever talk about it to our parents or any other adults unless something really bad happen (which it did, occasionally). I finally quit mid way through senior year after dealing with some harassment stuff that I think is banned from talking about in this sub (from male students, not from the directors), and that\u2019s when my parents finally learned all of what was going on. I was told by the second director that I should just suck it up, because that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a woman in a male dominated profession. I was 17. Even to get out, I still had to have a meeting with a vice principal, my parents, the directors, and my counselor to debate over whether I should be allowed to drop those classes. In the end, my counselor, who was known for being a hardass, ended up crying after the directors got up and left because of all the shit that was said during this meeting. I still have a panic attack whenever I see the head director because my younger sister attended the same high school. Genuine kudos to you for getting your daughter out of a very toxic situation early, because performing arts programs can be extremely fucked up.\n\nETA: some context for the harassment stuff.", "Your daughter might benefit from hearing the perspective of a professional dancer or a former professional dancer. \n\nTry to reach out to people in the community via other teachers, institutions, even on social media, or looking up interviews. I'm sure this is not the first time something like that has happened, and it's an issue kids her age will benefit from talking about. \n\nSure, discipline and though love are part of any competitive sport, but there are lines, and she should be taught how to navigate them, she might be more open to hearing about it if it comes from someone who has been down that road before and succeeded.\n\nYou could have handled it better than taking her out of the class without talking to her about it or finding alternatives for her to not quit something she's that passionate about. But your intentions are in the right place. NTA", "NTA. Your daughter isn't really wrong when talking about the \"real world\" because this type of abuse is pretty common with dancers, athletes, models etc\n\nThat said, I think you're right to protect your daughter.

I'd watch out for her eating habits for a bit, seems like Ms. X is an eating disorder trainwreck.\n\nEdit: also, from her reaction, seems like she's putting a lot of pressure on herself.

That\u2019s ok, and it\u2019s okay for her to feel discomfort through what she\u2019s dealing with now. All youth sports, very much including dance, are valuable because they teach kids grit, failure & the importance of hard work.

Be specific. She\u2019s 14, don\u2019t dumb it down. Tell her what she was experiencing was abuse and use that term. Let her know that allowing someone to continue to treat her that way would make you a bad mother and that your job is to protect her from that kind of harm and you\u2019re heartbroken that you didn\u2019t realize earlier. Be honest about the changes you\u2019ve seen in her. She probably thought she was hiding the stress well and having it pointed out that she wasn\u2019t may help her come to terms with just how bad it was affecting her. Be empathetic to her feelings of it being the end of the world to be pulled from the school but reaffirm that she\u2019ll be able to go to a new school and maybe ask her to help you research options as you want her help in making sure she\u2019s never put in that kind of situation again. \n\n14 seems like a good age to have a talk about relationships and different types of abuse and how it can show up in all types of relationships, not just romantic. Make sure she has a basic understanding of both power dynamics and manipulation. Most kids think about abuse in terms of violence and less so as psychological and emotional. This is a fraught situation but you have an opportunity to have some really important conversations that could impact her future relationships and help build her self esteem. \n\nI was a dancer and have seen girls vomit from stress or burst into tears when not perfect on one turn during a run through.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nMany performance careers and training for them are toxic.\n\nThe training and real world experiences will involve many more abusive people.\n\nIn training as an actor, the most renowned teachers were the most abusive. They were very popular, people felt very abused but felt it was only because the teacher knew better and was blunt, no bullshit. As if it was an honor to be abused by them. They broke down and always went back for more, excusing the abuse.\n\nYou have to be so disciplined, hard working and talented to outshine others so you push everything down and accept its going to be grueling.\n\nAnd you tell yourself if you can't take the heat now, how will you take it from directors in the future. So you become very hard on yourself and self abusive too.\n\nThere's so much unhealthy about it no matter who you are but some people handle it better. Some look like they are handling it but are locking it all up and mentally unwell.\n\nDo everything you can to sit in on a class, talk to teachers and ensure your daughter has great people mentoring her. \n\nEnsure in the chaos, she has positive mentors, who are safe and trusted. I think that's the best thing you can do for her because the toxic ones are inevitable. \nThe Good ones will help her navigate a toxic career, model strength, skills and discipline in healthy ways. And encourage your daughter to be the best person she can be, not just the best dancer.\n\nIn competitive, highly disciplined fields, you encounter toxic peers doing all the unhealthy things to succeed, toxic teachers, toxic employers. Bad influences.\nYou must also be exposed to good influences so you have repeat opportunities to be your best in a healthy way.\n\nI'm disappointed in your husband not reflecting deeply on this.\n\nAlthough your daughter had to be accepted to this school and may not get accepted to another or have to wait. And will most likely have other teachers like this one. You can't save her from every teacher like this, can only ensure she has some good ones in the mix.\n\nI'd look at if this is the only teacher or if there are others there too to be a positive influence before removing her entirely.\n\nMost likely you have to accept some level of this otherwise you will end up pulling her from every school. This isn't the path you'd like most for her I think. School is not going to be the same as extra curricular dance class. No one is in school as a hobby, they are training every student for their career so the intensity is going to be adult level.\n\nThis is a competive and high stress path so your daughter will be getting stressed, being hard on herself and kids will be breaking under pressure, leaving class.\nEven with the best role models, this is high pressure, many won't be able to handle the pressure and will drop out.\n\nYour daughter's behavior will change, she is no longer in normal school, she is training for a highly physical, highly competitive career. It's high stress, high stakes and you have to accept that if you support this path.\n\nYour daughter is going to practice things repeatedly and make mistakes repeatedly as she learns. It's going to be extremely frustrating and exhausting. While practicing solo, in front of teachers and peers, she's going to want to do perfectly but be making mistakes. \n\nNormal school isn't anything like this. \nNormal school grades you privately, but she will be graded vocally in front of everyone. It's high stress, even when you love it.\n\nThe amount of stress and pressure on the body to dance precisely is unhealthy in many ways. She sounds accepting of this but I reccomend seeing a counselor to monitor her and how this is impacting her overtime mentally and emotionally. As she is going to hold it in and bury it, basically mask it and hide it because she is committed. She is going to monitor her weight, her eating, her movements and become more self aware than normal people have to be. It's risky.\n\nYou won't know there is a serious issue until long after. A counselor can help monitor her, encourage healthy eating, healthy boundaries and coping skills for the stress.\nEven monthly would be useful in supporting her as a whole in reaching her career goals.\n\nIt's best to be realistic about what she is facing on this path so that she has a team around her who is prepared and best able to support her and understand her.\n\nSo you and your husband need to understand seriously the best ways to protect her and to also accept the grueling reality she faces.\n\nIt's so easy to get stars in your eyes about careers like this but the reality is also very harsh and must be seen honestly.\n\nIn careers like this everyone experienced will tell you, if you love this, if you need this to live and have to do this then fine but if you can do anything, then do that. This is a hard path, you may give it your all and still end up injured and starving. This is a hard path but an exciting and rewarding one to be on.\n\nBest of luck", "If you can contact any of the other parents, I would make copies of the recoding and share it with them.

Same director threatened to have the school withhold my diploma because I had like $50 in unpaid band fees she tacked on last minute my senior year as a result of my deciding not to participate in band activities after that trip. Trauma from adults you think you trust is really scarring.\n\nOP, be sure you press those directors to look into the abuse claims. Go to the local paper and anonymously leave the recording for them - I am sure any of the moms could have dropped a recorder that day into their girls bags.

And then, when we find one that you feel is the right fit for you, I bet others will follow\u201d.    Tell your daughter that she can be what her teacher is not and never will be.

I occasionally watched Dance Moms, and would joke that I watched to keep track of myself and make sure I never turned out like those mothers.\n\nI would cringe when watching Abby and the dancers.  It seemed so abusive to me, and I couldn't understand why the mothers put their daughters in that position.\n\nThe situation with your daughter seems very similar.

Please not only get her into a different school, but find her someone professional to talk with. Hugs to you, Mom.", "NTA\n\nDance can be a wonderful experience for a lot of people. It can also be dangerous- the pressure to be small enough, thin enough, light enough, cutthroat enough, etc. can really cause a lot of mental anguish and both mental and physical damage.

You aren't telling her that she can't dance- you're telling her you love her enough to not let anyone hurt her and risk her future. She might think that Ms.X is the best dance teacher in town. The cost to be \"the best\" is often unaffordable. You did the right thing. Find her another dance school, one that doesn't abuse it's students. It probably exists.", "I'm not sure. If she is planning on going to university and specializing in dance. She will be up against the best of the best, not just in her community.  But the country. The instructor will be worse.

I went through a similar thing. Many of the girls at my old dance studio started bullying me, some of the teachers did too. I told the teachers and nothing happened. I told the owner and it got worse. I had put such high importance on this studio and believed it was the only thing that could make me happy, even with the bullying. After my mom witnessed the owner verbally abuse me for daring to leave on time, she pulled me out of classes. I hated her in the moment, but soon learned that it was the best thing she could've done for me. We found another studio and I made friends immediately. One of the teachers there renewed my sense of self-confidence and, without the slightest bit of hyperbole, saved my life. \n\nYour daughter may be upset now, and may still be upset for a while, but you pulled her out of an abusive situation and eventually she'll realize that and hopefully thank you for it.", " NTA. Hopefully Sara will understand when she gets older. This is an abusive dynamic and you made the right call. I guess maybe when you apply to another dance school you could talk to other parents or look up reviews? Unfortunately these types of situations happen far too often.", "NTA", "This is correct.

It's a dance studio that offers classes, the teacher probably owns it herself.", "Eh.   It might not have been legal to do the recording.   Op should know the law before doing that.", "My daughter was a dancer for years, and it honestly did do a lot for her.  But I also saw a lot of damage and things I wouldn't want my daughter to be a part of.\n\nWhen she was five, I transferred studios for her because of unrelated reasons, and I was initially really happy with the studio she joined.  It had a real family vibe.  Then the studio got bigger, and the toxicity grew worse.  I wanted to pull her out for a year and a half before I did so, and the only reason I didn't was because she was happy there, and she had friends/duo partners I didn't want her to lose.  Thankfully, she is the type of girl who doesn't get caught up in the toxicity stuff herself, but believe me, I kept a close eye on things.\n\nWhen she was 12, it got to the point that I said blow it, she's leaving.  I couldn't stand it anymore.  And I wasn't the only one.  Four girls of a similar age left the term before us, and six of us left at the same time.  Within the next year, many girls of the next age group down also left.\n\nMany of us went to another studio together (and the problems the previous studio tried to create were insane).  We were very fortunate that the new studio was completely opposite.  My daughter was very happy there, and the only reason she ended up leaving (after nearly four years there) was because she was a bit burned out from doing dance for so many years, and she was about to start Year 10 at school, doing extension classes and knew she couldn't do both and do as well academically as she wanted to.  I am so grateful to that studio for letting my daughter experience a supportive place and allowing us to leave dance on a positive note.\n\nMy daughter was initially a bit resistant to leaving the toxic place, mainly due to feeling loyalty to it, I think.  One term after leaving, she was able to look back at it and see how toxic it really was, now that she'd experienced somewhere better.\n\nI'm not against kids dancing as such - there are many positives.  But you REALLY need to keep a close eye on things because there are far more bad places than good.  And sometimes it's not the owner/teachers that are the problem - it's the parents.", "It doesn't matter if it was a one party consent state or not, OP was not a party in the conversation. So it wasn't legal to record her at all, and there could be issues with that. \n\nThat said I would also protect my daughter regardless of the legality. I would just delete the recording to be safer.", "Legal and ethical are not the same. That was a third party recording, those are illegal everywhere. What she did was ethical.", "She might be able to give consent on behalf of her daughter, or the dance space might be considered a public space, which does not have the same expectation of privacy.  \n\nA local lawyer is needed for this.", "Sure.   Not disputing that.   A civil lawsuit generally cares more about the law than ethics.   I'm concerned that op could be sued by the dance teacher if the tape is heard by anyone.", "Absolutely. If it gets linked back to her, there will be nasty consequences.", "NTA \n\nEx dancer here, she needs to be fired immediately because these students will have an ED.", "NTA.\nLet the school know you'll be posting transcripts, and recordings of Mrs X online if they don't remove her.", "Not only is this abuse but I would also go so far as contacting the other parents and informing them. Some probably already know and don't care, but at least you tried. You may want to also formally contact the board with a documentation of what you witnessed and a copy of the recording. Ending with asking if they condone or support abuse?  May even want to threaten media exposure. That usually gets things moving. That or contacting BBB. NTA", "This brings back so many memories. When I was your daughters age I was in the exact same position. It ruined my love of dance and I eventually quit and am finally getting restarted in my 20s because I love it and it\u2019s a great workout. That being said, there\u2019s so many dance teachers that teach the way that teacher does and it\u2019s so unnecessary. I credit my anxiety disorder (that I\u2019ve never truly recovered from) to starting at that time because of that class. You don\u2019t need an abusive instructor to learn about the \u201creal world\u201d. In real world if you\u2019re being abused why would you stay in that job? Why ruin your life like that? I understand where your daughter is coming from because when you\u2019re that young you\u2019re impressionable and don\u2019t know better. Also yes making a career as a dancer/artist isn\u2019t easy and you should definitely talk to her about what that would mean/look like but I promise it doesn\u2019t look like abuse. Big NTA\n\nEdit to add: tell your daughter she doesn\u2019t need to be abused to be the best. With dance what you put in is what you get out of it.

Enroll her in a new dance school!", "To add some perspective, I danced growing up at a family dance studio. We even did competitions, the staff wasn\u2019t crazy about it like Dance Moms but it was pretty fun.\n\nTheir philosophy, posted on their website, explains that they have coached dancers who have turned professional, kids who wanted an expressive outlet, or those who were talented but had other passions successfully. We did fun things like our city\u2019s parades, not just competitions. I learned early on that dance should be an outlet for your feelings, from my teacher who would theme whole recitals around a musician he was into at the time. Never would I have heard language spoken like this at the studio. Injuries were taken to the utmost seriousness. We were always asked about the subjects we liked in school and how our college search was going (as teens).\n\nAs I\u2019ve grown up, I worked with an extremely famous dance company in a non-dance role and have moved on to other, similar things. OP should know that *whoever* trains her daughter at 14 years old, and even if she\u2019s really good at that age, there\u2019s an extremely high likelihood her daughter will not be a professional dancer. And so the best teacher is someone who will create a positive adult mentorship in her life, through the highs and lows of not only dance but the world at large. \n\nAs I\u2019ve watched different people who attempted being in the industry drop out in different ways, one thing does define their success or failure - self-esteem, which creates the resilience needed to adapt to other careers and to do well in whatever one chooses. \n\nMoving her to a new studio will be a great decision.
