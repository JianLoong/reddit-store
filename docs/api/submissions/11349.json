She started classes around 5 and has been in them consistently ever since. She\u2019s won competitions over the years and worked really hard to get into a dance school that ranks very highly in our state. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly a \u201cstage mom\u201d I just see it makes her happy and told her as long as she keeps her grades up I\u2019ll always be there to help make her dream happen. She plans to go to an academy in New York when she graduates and I really wanna see her make it there. \n\nSara started her new school about 4 months ago. At first everything was great she would come home exhausted but excited. After a few weeks she would start coming home just exhausted and moody or sometimes down on herself if she missed a count etc. I tried asking if everything was ok and she would just brush it off saying they\u2019re training extra hard for a competition or she\u2019s just trying to push herself more. \n\nLast week I was a bit early to pick up Sara after practice so I just sat in the parking lot and read. I noticed a girl run out the doors crying and heaving. I met her to make sure she was ok and not dehydrated or having an anxiety attack. She muttered \u201cMs. X is so evil\u201d and walked away. \n\nThe rest of the team started streaming out before I could go after her or ask what happened. Sara got into the car looking a bit shaken. I asked if anything happened I should know about and she said no. I asked if Ms. X ever yells or hurts any one and she shook her head and stayed quiet the rest of the ride. \n\nI got a recorder that night and hid it in Sara\u2019s gym bag and turned it on when I handed her the bag while dropping her off hoping that it would pick up something since they\u2019re usually left along the wall in the same room they dance in. When she got home the next day I took it out and listened. All was normal until I heard what sounded like someone falling and Ms. X berating the girl. Calling her horrible names and such. Later I even heard Ms. X tell a girl to lose weight or she\u2019s done and she doesn\u2019t care \u201chow it happens\u201d. \n\nObviously I told Sara she would not be going back and we will find a new place. I also sent an anonymous email to the board Ms. X is certified through and just got a basic \u201cwe\u2019ll look into it\u201d response. \n\nSara flipped her lid freaking out saying her future is over and Ms. X was preparing them for the real world and I\u2019ll never understand. She said she\u2019ll never be one of the best now. Just full meltdown I\u2019ve never seen before. It scared me and made me double down because in my head this proves she had way too much pressure on her and none of it was healthy for her. \n\nHer dad says I should let her go back. I argued we can afford a school just as nice or even better so it shouldn\u2019t matter in the long run. Sara barely looks at me. Should I have let her stay and just watch her closely?

It happens any kind of abusive relationship but it's often best recognized in abusive romantic relationships. This teacher is isolating her students and making them dependant on her, so she can continue to abuse them. They'll keep coming back, they'll keep tolerating her abuse, because they believe her when she tells them she's the only key to their success. She'll make damn sure they believe they'll never be anything without her, that every other teacher is wrong and awful at what they do. She probably also tells them they shouldn't be friends with kids from other studios.\n\nYou're doing the right thing. There are plenty of good, great, *better* teachers out there that don't use abusive methods. But seriously, you need to know that this is abuse and it is just as real and just as harmful for a dance teacher to do this to your kid as it would be for a boyfriend. NTA.", "NTA! Your daughter needs you to sit down with her to explain the difference between effective teaching and abusive manners.", "NTA, as a parent you have the responsibility to protect her from abuse by other adults. By reporting the problem instructor to the board, you are teaching The instructor how the \u201creal world\u201d works.\n\nMaybe be less anonymous. Find a new school for her and use the problem\u2019s behavior as a litmus test for new instructors.\n\nNo idea how to get it across to your daughter though. Other than explaining that in the real world social sanctioned abuse happens frequently in these kinds of high peer pressure cult of personality situations. That these are a hazard she is going to have to learn to recognize and avoid/escape.", "NTA, your daughter was being abused.  There is a difference between constructive criticism and abuse.  You identified abuse.  Your daughter is lucky you want her to have a positive experience.", "Of course Sara doesn't understand. She's been trained into Ms X's abusive methods and worldview.\n\nOf course you're NTA for taking her out of that situation which is clearly bad.\n\nBut it needs a bigger conversation with Sara for her to understand why.", "Oh god, this made me sick to my stomach. You are most definitely NTA and I\u2019m gonna share a story from when I was in high school because I wish someone would\u2019ve gotten me out. I was in band for 7 years and was in almost every music group on campus because I was so committed to it. The directors, however, were some of the worst people I\u2019ve ever encountered. They were both women, for context, and were incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive, as well as sometimes being borderline physically abusive (there were rumors involving physical abuse as to why the second director was transferred to our school my freshman year). They put all of us down constantly and it was an extremely toxic environment. I\u2019m in my mid 20s now and I know a girl two years older than me who is still in therapy to this day because of what went on in that program in the name of \u201cperfection.\u201d We were all so brainwashed by this system that we didn\u2019t ever talk about it to our parents or any other adults unless something really bad happen (which it did, occasionally). I finally quit mid way through senior year after dealing with some harassment stuff that I think is banned from talking about in this sub (from male students, not from the directors), and that\u2019s when my parents finally learned all of what was going on. I was told by the second director that I should just suck it up, because that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a woman in a male dominated profession. I was 17. Even to get out, I still had to have a meeting with a vice principal, my parents, the directors, and my counselor to debate over whether I should be allowed to drop those classes. In the end, my counselor, who was known for being a hardass, ended up crying after the directors got up and left because of all the shit that was said during this meeting. I still have a panic attack whenever I see the head director because my younger sister attended the same high school. Genuine kudos to you for getting your daughter out of a very toxic situation early, because performing arts programs can be extremely fucked up.\n\nETA: some context for the harassment stuff.", "Your daughter might benefit from hearing the perspective of a professional dancer or a former professional dancer. \n\nTry to reach out to people in the community via other teachers, institutions, even on social media, or looking up interviews. I'm sure this is not the first time something like that has happened, and it's an issue kids her age will benefit from talking about. \n\nSure, discipline and though love are part of any competitive sport, but there are lines, and she should be taught how to navigate them, she might be more open to hearing about it if it comes from someone who has been down that road before and succeeded.\n\nYou could have handled it better than taking her out of the class without talking to her about it or finding alternatives for her to not quit something she's that passionate about. But your intentions are in the right place. NTA", "NTA. Your daughter isn't really wrong when talking about the \"real world\" because this type of abuse is pretty common with dancers, athletes, models etc\n\nThat said, I think you're right to protect your daughter. Just because it's \"normal\" doesn't mean this abuse should be accepted. I'd watch out for her eating habits for a bit, seems like Ms. X is an eating disorder trainwreck.\n\nEdit: also, from her reaction, seems like she's putting a lot of pressure on herself. Maybe she can see a therapist while she pursues her dancing career? Btw if she does start seeing a therapist, please don't go behind her back and ask the therapist about what's discussed. I understand why you recorded the dance lesson but she'll end up with trust issues if it happens a lot", "Lose weight and she doesn't care how the student  dos it???\nwho's in charge of this school?\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nyou are right to protect your daughter", "I would say NTA. The only gray area here is bugging her bag, but that basically confirmed your suspicions. If I were you, I would go to your local news station with that recording to put some public pressure on the board to fire this teacher.", "NTA.  Your daughter is in an abusive situation and needs to get out.", "NTA.\n\nPlease follow up your complaint with one that you sign.  If Ms X does not own her dance school, send it to the board of directors or owners of the school.  \n\nEngage your daughter in the process of screening other dance schools.  \n\nThis is a tough situation, since on one hand you were doing the right thing not to hover, but on the other hand while you respected your daughter's privacy she was in an abusive situation.", "NTA.  Your daughter is being abused, and so are all those other kids.", "NTA, i had this conversation with my daughter at 9 that gymnastics and dancing are not healthy sports. They encourage to much self hatm to \"be the best\" and after their career it leaves them picking up the pieces.", "The whole lose weight whatever it takes would be an absolute no go for me. There is enough pressure on young girls, especially in a sport like dance, they don\u2019t need teachers actively encouraging eating disorders. That is not  road you want her to walk down and as a parent we sometimes have to make difficult decisions. She thinks her dreams are ruined but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around when she realizes they aren\u2019t.", "NTA. This behavior gets so overlooked in youth competition and needs consequences. Ms. X is going to be the villain in at least one memoir that includes self-harm and eating disorders.", "NTA.  You are never the asshole for protecting your child from abuse and that is exactly what this teacher is doing.  She is abusing those kids.  I guess preparing them for the real world means teaching them how to be bullied.  Your daughters safety, mental health, and well being are more important.  I promise you will not regret changing schools.  But in another year, if your daughter was still there, and this woman had reduced her to nothing, you'd regret that.", "Obviously, your first priority is to protect your daughter. However, if you have proof that this is happening I think you also have an obligation to alert the school & other parents. Not sure how much weight an anonymous complaint will have. There\u2019s a huge difference between a coach training kids to make good choices & be their best vs an abusive coach with no concern for the safety of their student-athletes. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\n> Ms. X was preparing them for the real world and I\u2019ll never understand.\n\nThe real world of dance is full of the same kind of people.  Honestly you would be doing your daughter a favor to keep her out of dance.", "NTA.  You're doing what you think is best for your daughter and your decision is reasonable in these circumstances.", "NTA, your daughter doesn't understand that you are protecting her mental and physical health.", "NTA. I don't expect your teenage child to understand. But you're absolutely doing what's best for her. She's going to be fully brainwashed if you don't step in and remove her from this situation. \n\nOf course she should learn how to navigate the \"real world\". But not like this.", "NTA if Ms. X is not the owner of the studio you need to contact them. Play them the recording and ask if verbal abuse & threatening weight loss at the risk of causing adolescent eating disorders is what their studio advocates. \n\nBy all means pull your daughter out but I would escalate this on social media if the studio owner does not address this.", "Does she knock students down?\n\nNTA.", "NTA trust your gut momma bear! \n\nYour girl is at a vulnerable age where information is coming from all angles at her.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you just go in and observe a class? And if you say \u201cbecause parents are not allowed\u201d: YTA. NEVER sign your kid up to any class where parents are not permitted to come in and observe.", "Info; do you live in a 1 consent state (if in the US)? Otherwise I'd weight in on the serious legal repercussions you could face for recording this teacher without consent...\n\nI don't want to say y-t-a, because as parents it IS our job to look out for them. But sometimes, looking out for them includes giving them a say in their own lives. You were doing what you felt was best, and no one can fault you for THAT, but her feelings in it matter too. Maybe more pushes at conversing about it?\n\nEdit to add; gonna in the end go with NTA, because that teacher was out of line. Just wanted to voice a few thoughts on the matter :)", "[deleted]", "Info:  where did you get the recorder?
