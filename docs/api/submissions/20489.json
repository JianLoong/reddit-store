I find it hard to believe that an '04 Civic easily handled going \"110+ at some points.\"\n\nI'm tempted to just call AH for driving recklessly in the first place, but since this is specifically about the car, we need more information on its condition and what happened leading up to the breakdown.", "YTA for driving like a complete idiot.", "110 mph is the top speed of a base model 2004 Civic. You were basically red lining his car for 2 hours.\n\nI'm shocked he didn't notice, or say anything. Clearly, YTA. As for whether that means you should pay all, probably not. If I did that to my friend's car, I would want to pay at least some for the damage I caused.", "YTA - You were driving 90-100 mph?  That's AH on its own, it's unsafe. Follow the speed limit.\n\nAnd you weren't driving a sports car, you were driving a car that was not ever intended to run at that speed for that amount of time.\n\nThe whole reason why someone will ask another person to drive their car is generally that they aren't feeling up to paying attention to driving.  Your friend trusted you to be responsible for his car.  And he ought to be able to trust you to be responsible with his car!\n\nThe fact that he relaxed, wasn't closely monitoring your driving, didn't backseat drive the whole way, indicates that he trusted you.\n\nAnd you violated that trust, and took trust to be an excuse to be reckless.\n\nEdit for context:\n\nFor those in the rest of the world, 100 mph is around 160 km/h.  The top speed limit in California is generally 70 mph, or around 112 km/h.  Anyone driving as fast as OP claims to have been is a menace to everyone else on the road.  If OP was pulled over for driving over 100 mph, they could face a fine of up to $500, and have their licence suspended for 30 days for a first offense.  It's not a minor thing.  OP shouldn't even have been asking the car owner if it was okay to go that fast - the state of California already told him it wasn't. \n\nDeliberately choosing to break the law, risk the lives of yourself and others, and disregard common sense about what speed a vehicle can manage has consequences. \n\nPaying for a new engine is cheap compared to the fines and associated penalties for speeding at that rate, not to mention the cost of having to take a cab everywhere for a month if OP's license was suspended.  And that's nothing compared to what's on your conscience should someone else be injured or killed by your reckless driving.", "WTF? How did either of you pass your driving exam? \n\nESH", "ESH - for reckless driving on your part and your friend not saying anything about it.\n\nEdit - OP stated in a comment he was doing 90+ the whole way and 110+ some parts.", "ESH. Even a base Civic will cruise all day at 90 if well maintained. Where did you come from? If you pulled that over the Altamont, in a 19 year old beater that probably already blew the head gasket, you killed the engine. But it was probably on its last legs. If you didn't over rev it or anything, it was bad maintenance that killed the engine. \n\nYou're TA because I drive on those freeways and there are enough idiots on them without ones coming in from the valley.", "YTA. you break it, you pay for it.", "YTA. You\u2019re the driver which means you pay attention to what\u2019s happening with the car.
