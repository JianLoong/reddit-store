Just to get to the end of our street is a mile!\n\nAfter him losing his job, we decided it's definitely best to try to sell his car and get something cheaper. His payment is around $520/month.

The only preference he has is he wants an SUV or truck since we live in an area with snow. \n\nWe went to a local car dealership just to start our search. They advertised some good lease deals. After getting there, we took a new truck on a test drive and he liked it. The initial payment they gave us was close to $600/month. We said absolutely not. We told them as soon as we got there where we wanted our payment to be. \n\nThis salesman kept increasing what they would give us for his car.

Of course you\u2019re NTA.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe this. You were basically on a date and had certain boundaries you put in place when you arrived. Your date ignored them and was pushy. You stood up for yourself by leaving instead of staying and allowing yourselves to be taken advantage of.

I could fill a book with the stories. I doubt you are the only people to sneak out of the back of that place. The ridiculous thing is having to.", "NTA. They were messing around with you. You wasted enough time on their nonsense.", "NTA, all typical sales tactics.

It\u2019s a wear down tactic they use.\n\nHonestly, shop online, figure out what you like and get them to agree to all the pricing before you even go in to test drive the vehicle.\n\nI\u2019d also hold off on letting them know you have a trade as long as possible.\n\nFair warning right now is a horrible time to buy a vehicle. Used prices are still trending upwards and interest rates are much higher than they were even a year ago. So you may be hard pressed to find something less expensive that is still as reliable etc. \n\nAlso the payment/month is also a sales tactic. Don\u2019t let them stretch your payments out to some ungodly term so that your monthly payment is lower.", "NTA\nYou must be willing to walk away at any time.

The salesman is trying to get as much money as possible and you are trying to spend as little as possible. Those are the rules of the game. If you are not able to reach an agreement, it is perfectly fine to leave. \n\nIn order to maximize profit, they have many techniques they have developed over the years. One is to basically browbeating you down into accepting a poor offer by trying to keep you there as long as possible. If you have told them No and they still try to hold you, it is perfectly acceptable to leave.", "NTA\n\nThis is a car dealership, not a prison. You are free to walk out at any time.", "I have worked in the Dealership Scam, err 'Business'' for many years and 1/2 a dozen different corporate umbrellas... Ready, ok then Listen Up - Car Dealers are NOT YOUR FRIENDS! They do NOT 'want to help you' & are NOT interested in 'getting you the best deal possible'... NONE of them - NOT ONE!.  Car Dealerships are in the business of: 1\\] Getting the highest price you are willing to pay.  2\\] Separating you from as much of your money as they can get as a Down Payment. 3\\] After getting you to agree to a \"price\"... loading the deal with as many useless & overpriced 'dealer add-ons' as you will buy (honestly you don't need ANY of them). Then 4\\] Financing the remaining balance at the HIGHEST interest rate they can get you to pay - they will literally get an approval from the bank at (example) 11.9% APR, then try to get you to sign a contract at 14.9% APR - because the dealership gets to keep 75% of the 'difference' between the bank rate & the contract rate.  This is NOT a crazy conspiracy theory. It is in fact their  Business Model.  They literally TRAIN their employees to do this & Fire anyone with a conscience or any sort of reservations about screwing over their friends & family who are just looking to buy a decent car.  New Car Dealer, Used Car Dealers, Luxury Car Dealers, ALL of them follow this business model, even the dealers who say \"We are different, we treat our customers like family\" can only say that because its true, they will treat you just like they treat their families, they will screw you over just like they do to their families.\n\nSo yeah, you are NOT the AH - but before you buy a car or truck - join a Credit Union (or Costco), get a pre-approval for a loan at a set rate (guarantee its better than the dealership financing), then ask them for a referral to their \"Membership Pricing\" dealership.  walk in with a check already made out for the exact amount you want to pay - OUT THE DOOR (ie: including everything but state tax & tags) then tell them \"I want that car at this price, take it or leave it.\"", "We found all our cars on Autotrader.com. You can enter tons of filters like price, make, model, options, year. Haven't been in a car dealership except to test drive/possibly purchase vehicle in years.

You are under no obligation to sit and listen to offers and are free to leave whenever you want", "NTA - Yes...one 'no' should have been sufficient but skilled sale tactics were in play. The longer they keep you there the more likely you will buy. Crawl out a window, fake a medical emergency...what ever it takes to regain your freedom. Best to you!", "NTA. You said no several times. It\u2019s on the salesman.", "Last time I bought a car by myself (F) I got financing arranged at my credit union ahead of time, went to the dealership to test drive the used car they listed online (they have to honor that listed price but have free rein to sell you extra stuff as add ons) and after liking the car, told them they had one hour to write the deal or it was off. It took two- even bringing my own financing, they still tried to make some more money. I wish I had walked at the one hour mark but I liked the car and it was a fair price for it.

That\u2019s your price ceiling, and you need to know that first and only be looking at stuff that falls under that.  What is your credit score and what interest rate do you qualify for?  ARe you already prequalified for your ceiling amount with a third party?  Dealerships love to sucker you out of more money by making the loan through their finance company.  If they can match the best interest rate you qualify for, you can often get a benefit from agreeing to finance through the dealership, but if you don\u2019t already know what you qualify for, they will lead you around by the nose.  WHy even go to the dealership and subject yourself to these games?  Shop online, negotiate on total out the door price via email. If you must test drive something, go test drive, ask for a price quote and then leave to think about it.  You can figure out the monthly payment using online calculators.  ONly once you\u2018ve got a deal nailed down should you be going to the dealership.", "Can't you get pre-approved through your bank? I did that but had an idea of what I could afford", "Agreed. Manipulation tactics like this can get people into situations where they buy things they really don't need and can affect them for life (a prime example is of course time shares and the horrible tactics used there).
