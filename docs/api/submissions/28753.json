Forget guilt tripping, your brother is just plain tripping.\n\nNot your niece's fault, though, so if she's old enough to be upset, maybe explain to her directly you already made a commitment and make a fuss of her in another way?", "NTA.

I have a tendency to occasionally try and organise last minute plans with friends when an opportunity comes up. I always say that I know it's last minute and will completely understand if they can't make it. Because I value their time and am not entitled enough to think that they should drop everything for me with little warning. I've known all my friends for decades and, for me, the secret to such long lasting friendships is to never take them or their time for granted. \n\nDo not give in to the guilt tripping. Spoil your partner and have a wonderful time! X", "NTA. You made plans before the invite.

Is an entirely complete answer and requires no further explanation. If bro is kicking off, it's because he's the one who screwed up and is too embarassed to admit it.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s a last minute planning for a party, that\u2019s a week after the actual date of the birthday. Just because your brother is terrible at planning, doesn\u2019t mean you should guilty. You planned your partner\u2019s birthday well in advance. Just flat out go ahead with your plans & tell brother \u201csorry, we won\u2019t be coming. because we already have plans.\u201d", "NTA it your partner birthday and you make plans with him first.", "NTA.  You\u2019re allowed to have a life and plans.  It\u2019s your brothers fault for expecting people to come to a party last minute.", "Rather it is your partners birthday or not doesn't even matter. If you don't want to go to your niecs party, you don't have to. Especailly since it was last minute.\n\nYour brother is coming off as very selfish, having a poorly planned party and then just expecting everyone to drop what they are doing and come. \n\nNTA", "Nope! You are not at fault at all. You had previous plans. Maybe next year they will plan better.", "NTA", "NTA. The invitation was last minute, that often leads to people having other plans. Not your fault, and your niece will be fine. Her parents are being terribly rude; no means no.", "100% this.  I no longer need to answer this question as you've expressed exactly what I'm thinking.", "I hate that so much. Duh I messed up ,you have to miss your life for me! No you don\u2019t have to miss. Go do you and partners plans.", "NTA. You made plans & promises to your partner for his actual birthday. The invite for the party wasn\u2019t received until it was too late to change things. I don\u2019t believe that you posted your niece\u2019s age, but even if she is in elem school she can probably understand how sad it would make her if someone made plans for her birthday and then told her something else came along and you decided that would be better than hanging with her. Remind her that while you won\u2019t be there, she will have lots of people who are able to go and it will be tons of fun. If you have time, perhaps go over the night before and deliver a gift if you haven\u2019t given her one yet. This way you can avoid getting sucked into staying. \n\nMy final advice is to talk with your niece & then tell everyone who has comments on your behavior to fuck off. You are an adult. You talked to your niece. You are done with the conversation and will not discuss it further. If anyone calls, remind them you aren\u2019t discussing it & if they continue the call will be over. If you have to, a simple I told you I\u2019m not discussing this and so good bye. If you wish to talk about anything else I\u2019m happy to do so, but for now I\u2019m done. Then hang up the phone. I promise it will only take a couple of times maximum until they get the word around. You could even text letting them know you aren\u2019t talking about it and how you will end a discussion.", "NTA\n\nThey don\u2019t have the same birthday, they just didn\u2019t plan well and doubled booked. \n\nTheir fault, not yours.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu would be an AH to cancel your partner's birthday plans for your niece's party.", "NTA. Of course not - even if it is not your partner's bday, you had plans, they planned a birthday party not on the birthday at the last minute. If you invite people to an event, you have to accept that they may already have plans. If you invite them with 2 days warning, then you have to accept that it is *likely* they have plans. And if you plan a birthday party on a day other than the birthday, you have to understand that no one has set aside that day in case there is a party.", "NTA. You made advanced plans. Guilt tripping is just that.", "NTA.  Your brother needs to grow the duck up and realise that other people have lives and plans.  I\u2019d shut him down bluntly if he is guilt tripping and manipulating.", "You can only feel guilty if you are guilty of something.  Making plans ahead of time is an acceptable reason to not attend another (especially last minute) event.  Why in the hell would you feel guilty?  NTA.", "Drop by with a present and apologize that you can\u2019t stay. That present is what she\u2019s looking for, anyway.", "I bet He\u2019s probably guilting OP because a lot of other guests can\u2019t come either", "\\^\\^THAT\\^\\^ right there."]}
