Criteria for this varies by state. If so, you can't evict someone for adding a tenant through marriage except in a few defined circumstances. (Source: I am a landlord).  If he had had the wherewithal to take you to court, he might have won that one. You would have had to have done a formal tenant screening and denied her based on (legally permitted) criteria, like credit score or something.\n\nIn the future, always write up a lease agreement even if it is family (or especially when it is family).

If the family member is concerned about where your brother and his wife will be for the holidays, that family member can open their doors for them. You were doing a kindness to your brother. It was solely on him to inform you of his impending wife. He didn't. Also make sure that since he left, he quit any agreement he had with you about his staying with you. It is now over. You didn't owe him the kindness in the first place; you definitely don't owe your surprise SIL the same kindness.", "NTA wth", "NTA. You're right. You don't know her.

If they don't like what you did, then tell them to let your brother and wife move in with them.\n\nAlso, with them trying to play the \"it's the law\" that I live with my husband would really give me pause as I would wonder what they would try to do if you did let them stay with you.  Sounds like you had the same thought and won't let her establish legal residency in your place - smart move.\n\nI am also very surprised to hear you let your brother move in as he needed to work on issues but he went out and got married (and doesn't have the means to support himself or his wife).

But tenancy and eviction laws still apply.", "This applies to one specific geographic location. It is not the same across the US and especially not worldwide.", "The Fair Housing Act applies across the US. Most states have laws regulating residency when there is no lease agreement. The specific criteria does vary from state to state - the link was just a good summary example of how people expose themselves to legal liability when they let someone live with them indefinitely/long term. Definition of long term also varies across states. I mentioned in other comments that this only applies if OP is in the US."]}
