It doesn't matter what season it is! \n\nIf you were renting a separate place where you didn't live, to your brother, you would most likely be legally obligated to let his wife live there.

The fact he tried to threaten you saying legally he lives there means he was using you and is willing to put your comfort and safety at risk. \n\nI would be worried he speaks to someone at the shelter that will help him get back into your home.

This is a whole parade of red flags.
