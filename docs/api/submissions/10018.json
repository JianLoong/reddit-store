I could already feel myself getting annoyed at the idea of having to spend time around a child, but I decided to be polite and not say anything about it.\n\nHowever, things quickly took a turn for the worse when the child started to cling onto me and try to play.

I pulled the dad aside and lectured him on his parenting skills, telling him that he shouldn't have brought his kid along and that it was ruining my day. I even went so far as to tell him that he should have left the kid at home with a babysitter, or just not come at all.\n\nAs the day went on, the kid kept trying to play with me and talk to me, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I was getting increasingly annoyed and frustrated, so I eventually got up and left the picnic early, without saying goodbye to anyone.\n\nLater on, I told some of my friends about the situation and how I had dealt with it, expecting them to be on my side. However, they all told me that I was behaving like an entitled asshole and that I needed to learn how to deal with kids, especially in a social setting.\n\nI just don't understand why people think that it's okay to bring their kids to events like this.

Website said 11-10 and they cut off their phone so I couldn't make sure it was 11-10 but since the website and FB page said it was I figured okay. No, up front is 11-2, bar 2-5, up front 5-10. They were going to let my kids in the bar part. Tons of signs saying 21+, no kids but mine were welcome.

Obviously it doesn\u2019t apply to most Germans, but some do have this attitude that children are meant to be seen and not heard. It was meant as a lighthearted joke.", ">I don't think it's wrong, bad, or obnoxious for a child to speak to an adult.\n\nIt is when the adult involved doesn't like it and doesn't want it to go on\n\n>What's assholish is not even being able to tolerate a child in the vicinity.\n\nOP was perfectly able to tolerate the child until it started annoying them actively. Also, no, it's not assholish to have your personal views on what surrounds you. I'm not morally obliged to like children.\n\n>The fact of a child existing isn't a sensible or reasonable boundary.\n\nIn fact no one is saying the opposite. A child existing per se is not a boundary, but actively interacting with them is, and if I don't want to I simply don't want to", "'Do YOu tHiNk pArents Can cOnTrOl tHeIr Child'\n\nYes Linda.

We brought loads of delicious food and drinks, but I was really annoyed because one of my friends brought his kid. I hate children and can't understand why anyone would have them.\n\nWe ate and drank and the child played around us the whole time. It wanted to play with me the whole time and was annoying... I just didn't know how to deal with it. Then it accidentally spilled my drink on me (on my expensive new jacket!!) and I freaked out. I screamed and scolded and yelled at the child and his father and said that his son was badly brought up and that he should think about his upbringing. Then I left the party. I didn't even apologize because I feel the child shouldn't have been there and it wasn't my fault that I reacted the way I did.\n\nA few weeks later I told the story to some friends and they said I really acted like an asshole. I don't understand what I did wrong. I mean, I've always been open about my opinions about kids, and I feel like my friend is a bad father for taking his kid everywhere and allowing him to run around and behave as he pleases.", "Hit right click and \"translate page\".", "Yeah sure.
