Parking fee's and gas fall under 'transportation costs' in my mind. \n\nThat being said, as the driver, I wouldn't blow up at a friend over this either, and I do agree with OP his friend was wrong in that regards. The OP is not OBLIGATED to pay for this ticket. My whole point was though that even if they aren't obligated it's still a decent thing to do in this circumstance, minus the whole 'friend demanding it and blowing up' side of things.\n\nAlso it depends on the circumstances of the accident.

Driver *opens* the discussion of paying for the $70 ticket with effectively \"this is on both of us so you owe me\"\n\n5. OP *responds* with \"excuse me you were driving\"\n\n6. Argument escalates, OP and Driver aren't talking.\n\n---\n\nNow, in my book, Driver opening with an accusation and a demand like that *with a friend* starts this entire conversation off on a stupid foot. You've just spent the entire evening as a team and the second something goes bad you're demanding compensation? \n\nOP *could* have responded better like \"hey hold on a sec man\". On the other hand, Driver's already had and hopefully gotten over the freakout, which would have already set the mood of the situation towards tension and conflict.\n\nDriver set the whole stupid thing in motion, Driver's an asshole.  OP is presumably not Mr Rogers so responding badly to a friend being an asshole to him?  Not really an asshole move in and of itself.  Did OP escalate further?  Not from what he's shared, unless he was insulting and shitty to OP about declining to pay.\n\nIn an ideal world, Driver apologizes for blowing up on his friend, OP pays for half, they make up and move on.\n\nOP didn't respond *great*, but when you're unexpectedly on the defensive you're probably not the asshole.", "NTA - But like, how much is the fine? In my town a parking ticket is $10.00 USD. I don't see how either side would be too upset in that case.", "INFO - I think a key question is how much was the ticket?  For instance I went to see George Carlin in Philly.  We couldn't find any parking nearby that would last the length of the concert, so I just parked where I could (while I was driving, it was my friend's dad's truck - I was also picking up a hardtop for my CJ-7 while in the area.  Technically we went to see Carlin because we were in the area to pickup the hardtop!)  Being Philly, of course I got a parking ticket.  But it was only $10.  That was cheaper than parking would have cost anyway.  I paid the whole ticket, but I think you get the point - if the ticket was cheaper than paid parking for the event I'd probably chip in half.", "If y'all were life partners, it'd be good to split the cost of the ticket if both people agreed a questionable parking situation was okay. That's my opinion anyway.\n\nBut. That isn't what this is. You don't get any benefit from paying off half of the cost of your friend's mistake. He's the driver, it's his responsibility to drive and park legally, as well as pay any penalties for failing to do so. \n\nYour friend is being absurd. It's not your job, nor any kind of social obligation, to pay off his parking tickets. NTA\n\nETA: two heads are better than one. Life will be easier for you and friends will appreciate it if you also look out for them, which in this case looks like chiming in if you happen to notice this parking spot needed some kind of action to be legal. I don't know if this was the case here but just mentioning", "YTA. While legally you don't owe him anything it's definitely an AH move to just leave him with the full ticket. You benefitted from him taking you and now you leave him to pay the whole cost, not cool. It's not your fault but you're a shitty friend if you just take advantage of your friends like this. In a real friendship helping goes both ways.", "Legally, you're not required to. But if I was with a friend who drove me around and they got a parking ticket I'd offer to pay half for it. So YTA. Think about the gas money they spend driving you around too. Sometimes it's hard to figure out if you're allowed to park somewhere", "YTA for not helping to pay the cost of parking (whether that be in a paid lot or the ticket that he got for parking).  A speeding ticket would be different.", "NTA\n\nWhen I got a speeding penalty, I never asked or expected my passengers to help me out.\n\n(Did want to tell one of them they could walk home though when they said they knew i was speeding up too soon before the zone change \ud83d\ude04.)", "Technically NTA - I guess. And if that makes you feel better then thats great.  \nBut you were a willing and able passenger in that car, you didn't point out to your friend that he was parking somewhere he would get a ticket, which means there is a chance you would have parked in the same place.   \nIf I was your mate, and if I had to mention it in the first place about splitting the ticket, I would have done it politely. If you didn't pony up then I would re-evluate the friendship anyway.  \nBut in any case, he wouldn't have had to mention it. You were joint parties and I would have just paid my half and wrote it off to experience.  \n\n\nSo feel assured that refusing is the way to go, I'm just glad you aren't in my circle of friends.", "NTA, but also not a great friend. Just kinda neutral I guess.\n\nThere's no obligation to pay anything but if I was in your shoes, I'd offer to pay half. And if any of my mates were in the same situation, I would never force or expect them to contribute but I'm pretty sure they all would offer.", "Nah, i got a speeding ticket with my friend in the car and never once thought about having her split the pay. It was all on me as the driver", "NTA. You\u2019re not the owner or operator of the car. You didn\u2019t tell them where to park or that it was okay to park there. Now you *could be* a friend and help them pay for the ticket seeing as *they did* give you a ride. But that\u2019s on you to choose to be a good friend.", "Sounds like a them problem since they didn\u2019t make sure they were parked legally. If it had been your idea to park in that spot then yeah you should pay half but that\u2019s not what happened.", "I say NTA. Friends often share each others burdens; however the driver in this instance is the AH because according to the OP the driver had a bad reaction to the ticket that costs about as much as the new Legend of Zelda game; and then further made himself the AH by blaming OP for it to guilt them into paying.", "You share the ride you share the parking yes it's not your car but still you were together in this YTA", "NTA, but just a bit of YTA.\n\nTechnically, it's the driver's responsibility to drive and park safely and legally.\n\nBut in the same time there's a expectation of shared costs, in this case the cost of the driver's negligence. While you are not legally or morally obligated to share that cost, it does leave a sour taste in your friend's mouth: you, the passenger, got only the benefits, and he also got a lot of costs.\n\nAnd ideal situation would have been you offer to pay half the ticket and he refused. That way you showed that you acknowledge the benefit of being driven to the event and he showed that he acknowledges the moral responsibility is on him.\n\nBut the way you acted means that even if you recover the friendship (unlikely), he will never offer to drive you in the future. And it will reduce the likelihood to be offered carpooling by the rest of your common friends (since he's going to talk about it).\n\nRelationships are build on \"being willing to give more than you take\". When everyone does that, trust is established. In this case, none of you were willing to do that.", "I would have Uber if I was expecting to pay more then just gas an entrance parking fee", "ESH. It was weird of him to demand you pay for part of the ticket. Ultimately he was driving and should be ready to accept the responsibility. But the right thing to do would be for you to offer to pay half. You thought the spot was ok to park in so you contributed to the mistake. The parking benefited you. And as a passenger, you should've been trying to help find a legal spot. He was doing a favor for you and got a fine as a result. You got to go to your event without worrying about parking. The fact that you don't feel responsible at all is sketchy. Are you even friends? Why are you spending time together? I wouldn't offer to pay half of a speeding ticket but if this was an event with a difficult parking situation, you should take some of the responsibility. Unless you spoke up and said \"I don't think you should park here!\" And he did it anyway.", "This is a tough one for me. I\u2019m normally the one driving to these type of events, and I always make sure to park in a proper spot. If for some reason, I did not and received a ticket, I would not expect nor ask any of my passengers to split it with me. \n\nIf I\u2019m a passenger, I will pay for the parking as a thanks for giving me a ride. It would really depend on the situation if I would split a ticket, though. I would probably offer if we parked somewhere we all thought was legit, but if it was demanded I split the ticket, I\u2019d probably be resistant to that idea.\n\nIm going to go with NAH, because I can truly see both sides and can put myself in a position where I would agree with either of you, depending on the specific circumstances.", "It depends on how the conversation went before you guys parked. I was in your exact situation once. I encouraged my friend to just park in some grassy area. I split that ticket with him.", "NTA but I would've offered to split it.", "NWNBTA. He drove the car so he's responsible for parking. So he's responsible for the ticket. But as a friend I would share the ticket with the driver even tho the driver is the fault. He will learn the lesson and we will both will not repeat the same mistake in the future", "NTA.  This happened to my friend and I.  I told him not to park where he did.  When we got back, there was a ticket waiting for him.  He said I\u2019m paying half, I said no I\u2019m not.  I then told him I told you not to park there.", "NTA 100%\n\nAnd I am in disbelief over so many of the comments in\nthis thread.", "People saying YTA are out of touch to me, NTA at all. Not like you forced your friend to park there", "The only situation where I\u2019d disagree is if the passenger knows the parking situation better and tells the driver where it\u2019s safe to park, but was incorrect and the driver got a ticket because of it. I\u2019ve been the driver and the passenger in that situation, and both times whoever was incorrect paid the ticket.\n\nOP is NTA, the driver himself said he was good to park there but was incorrect. It would be cool if OP offered to split it though- if his friend is freaking out this much over it, I would be concerned that he\u2019s having money trouble and doesn\u2019t want to admit it.", "[deleted]", "The comments are definitely off-base.\n\nI've split the cost of ticket before, but we were travelling abroad and we had all agreed to share the costs of renting a car together, including any issues.

The driver is responsible for parking and has final say.\n\nThe only time the driver may have a case against other people in the car would be if they had insisted on parking in a specific place, but even then you should learn to push back if you're unsure about a parking spot.", "Thank you - should the driver *demand* anything? Probably not, should both people in the situation be friendly and amicable and split the cost? Probably.", "I think the difference is whether you would offer to cover half or would you expect your friend to demand you help pay?", "Finally a reply that made me feel sane, thank you.", "The best response.", "Frankly, if I\u2019m driving the car I make the final decision. I would never expect my friends to burden the cost of a ticket. It\u2019s like if I was driving and I got rear-ended.

It\u2019s the drivers fault 100%, and he is entitled to expect payment from a friend for his failure.", "So if OP shares the responsibility, what should he have done to prevent it? Would it be appropriate for OP to call out every potential traffic violation his friend was making? Or is the claim you're making that OP is responsible simply for being adjacent to the driver?", "The principle of is this reddit AILJ (am i legally justified) or AITA, because it seems like a lot of you don't understand the difference", "I think it\u2019s a great gesture to help pay for the ticket. But if somebody demands I pay them, that makes me far less happy about doing so.", "Lmao this isn't how it works. The driver is responsible. It's not only that they're legally responsible, it's just that if you're driving the car it's your responsibility. Socially, culturally, whatever, no driver expects passengers to be responsible for their parking or anything else to do with operating the vehicle. It absolutely is a ridiculous request, asking passengers who happened to be in the car with you pay for your parking ticket (unless they insisted on you parking there or told you they'd gone and paid for it but lied or something) isn't a thing.", "To be fair, $35 vs friendship loss, the *friend* chose the latter, first.  I'd view it as OP choosing friendship loss over \"the other person prioritizing $35 over their friendship, by making it into an issue in the first place\"... and also $35.\n\nIf you tried to *make* me to pay for your own mistake, and then got mad at *me* for declining, I'd probably drop you like a hot rock, and it absolutely wouldn't be about the *money*.  I don't like hanging out with idiots and jerks, let alone paying for the privilege,  and OP's friend is bordering on both, here.  I'd never expect a friend to pay for my mistake - part of being a reasonable friend is taking responsibility for your own actions. \n\nOn the other hand, for someone I value as a friend, I'd probably have already offered to help out with it when they were freaking out in the first place. Not out of any sense of obligation, but simply helping out a friend - but I'm also in a position financially where I'm not going to have to starve or bounce a rent check because of $35 bucks or anything.\n\nSo, I think you're right that they don't appear to be good friends. But I don't necessarily see that as meaning it's a Y T A, but also not can't quite peg it between N T A / E S H / N A H necessarily.

No, OP should definitely not be paying for any portion of a violation ticket", "They probably did what most adults going to an event do get a round or two on OP as a thanks for the ride. I don\u2019t ask my friends for gas money I ask for a double vodka tonic. Because when you are driving you have to hit it hard early to sober up by last call when you\u2019ve got to drag out your passengers.", "Yep, me and my friend started giving each other \u00a310 towards petrol when visiting each other. Until we realised we were trading the same \u00a310 note back and forth since neither of us use much cash anymore. We just laughed about it wnd stopped after that.", "Tell him to go to court and have the amount reduced", "I don\u2019t know why people think \u201cshotgun\u201d is a thing after a certain age. I got one saying driver should have eyes on road passenger should be saying clear on the right for turns or pedestrian. Lmao\u2026 No, that is not how you drive in your 30\u2019s. Driving is not a team sport.", "Everyone who disagrees with OP is a child without life experience, and everyone who agrees with OP is a logical thinker", "Yeah because nothing say \u201cgreat friend\u201d like pointing out mistakes they make while trying to do well intentioned thing s", "I mean, if you're the one making the mistakes than yea, that should be on you to pay for. If the people you're driving around we're to cause the mistake to be made in some way, then you'd have an argument for splitting costs, but if the mistakes are happening because of choices you are making, then how is that on anyone other than yourself? Them existing in the car when the mistake is made doesn't change that you are the one in control of the car and the one making the decisions \n\nYou're the one driving, you're the one deciding where to park your car, you're the one responsible for getting tolls paid on time whether you're paying directly or requesting your passengers cover that cost. I've been defacto driver in all my friend groups since I first started driving, and am now defacto driver with my partner because, like yours, he doesn't have a license, so I understand the frustration on that side of things but still, at the end of the day, any mistakes I make while driving are on me, because I am the one driving.", "Did you offer or did your friend demand you pay half?  If your friend demanded, then that's a pretty crappy friend.  If you offered, that's another story.", "Op states parking was very limited in the area they went to so they agreed to ride together. In that case, OP should pay half since OP drove to their friend's house with the intention of avoiding parking their car.", "Not sensible at all", "Yes, context does matter.   That's just the only situation I've been with a parking ticket.\n\nMy case, I made min wage while my friend was close to 6 figures.  I had to force them to take half from me.    Pricey  for me, but a hit I could afford to take.\n\nMy city a parking ticket is like 10 USD?   Where I was vacationing it was over 70 USD.    I don't know the price of the ticket in OPs case.   It seems a silly amount for a huge fight unless this is just the \"straw that broke the camels back\".", "Being a friend doesn\u2019t mean bailing people out of there mistakes. What if the driver got his car towed while you were the passenger? You say I\u2019m a good friend I\u2019ll pay half, your friend decides to put it off for two weeks. Two weeks later they are at the  tow yard call you up and say hey good friend it\u2019s $3000 total for the lot fee and release, you got that  $1500? You were the passenger, you didn\u2019t tell him not to park in a tow away zone, you still cool with paying half? Likely no, because it was the other AH\u2019s decision that created the cost.", "> It seems a silly amount for a huge fight unless this is just the \"straw that broke the camels back\".\n\nSure, I can agree with that. But I think you are ultimately agreeing with me, since you'd just be doing it if the cost is low enough and it's silly otherwise. You're not doing it because you should, and definitely not because it's \"basic human decency\" to do so. That was my main issue with that other comment.", "Teen planet", "That is fucking ridiculous. Unless OP insisted they park there, they are not responsible for the decision of the driver. \n\nThe driver has full responsibility for their vehicle. I have driven places taking friends and I have always been responsible for picking the parking location. When I get out, I check the signage to make sure it\u2019s legal to park there. If I\u2019m not sure, I ask them if they think it\u2019s legal to park there. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to me to ensure it is legal to park there. \n\nNone of this is that fucking hard.\n\nOP is NTA and younger people like this should learn how to take some fucking responsibility for themselves because this is pathetic.", "How did you read the whole post and come away with the idea that the friend asked?", "Is your friendship worth 35$", "Really? My friends have never told me where to park unless I've said something about it first. It would be overstepping to tell the driver how to drive or park unless it was a safety issue or something. If a spot looked sketchy, I might ask if they were sure they could park there, but it's 100% on the driver. NTA", "Technically his friend didn't pick him up, OP drove his own car to his friend's house, at his friends suggestion that they take his friend's car to this event.", "You have a pretty wild take here. Help with gas, pay-to-park, maintenance on a longer trip? Sure. A parking ticket because you parked somewhere you shouldn't have? Nah; that's on you. I'd never expect a passenger to even offer for something like this.", "What you would do for a partner is different than for a friend, though - it's usually a situation where the cost will be shared in the end through other expenses, if not paid up front. I'd never ask a friend to split a parking ticket with me, the idea seems absurd. The driver has responsibility unless the passenger is directing them.", "It\u2019s not the passenger telling the driver where to park. It\u2019s literally the driver finding a spot and asking the passenger \u2018do you think this looks ok?\u2019, the passenger also looking for any parking related signs, and saying \u2018looks good to me\u2019, or whatever the case may be.\n\nIt\u2019s a casual 10 second conversation, where both people evaluate the parking situation. Unless I know the block in the city where I live, this is the way it goes. People even let you know where you\u2019re most likely to find parking close to their place before you head over.", "That. Is hilarious.", "From what was posted it sounds like that friendship isn\u2019t worth a buck 50."]}
