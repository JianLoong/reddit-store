Absolutely, positively NTA in any way. On the contrary, I think you are being too lenient given the situation you describe.   \nI would refuse to be in his company and I would definitely never allow him to be in my daughter's life in any way. He would not step foot in my house again - not ever! Since his parents are so willing to overlook his BS I would never allow my daughter in their company unless I was present. I wouldn't trust them at all. Be polite? Not a chance in hell !!  \nI don't care if he's a \"recovering\" addict or up for sainthood, he's disgusting and his behavior in your home is truly unforgivable.   \nThis \"be the bigger person\" is pure nonsense, I'm tired of that being used to excuse abuse. All that means is you've accepted being wronged and the perpetrator doesn't have to be held responsible in any way.  \nHis parents are enablers, excusing this behavior is as sick as the behavior itself. I'm sorry to say, your husband isn't much better. I find it hard to believe that 4 months went by and he had no idea **something** bad was going on behind those closed doors. Expecting you to be polite to this creep tells me all I need to know.  \nI think that you have to rethink your entire relationship. This is an ugly situation.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, I'm all for sex work (safe, legal, etc) but he ruined items in the room and overstayed his welcome, by a lot. \n\nSecond, he never apologized for making a mess and I imagine damaging items. \n\nSo no, you don't have to forgive someone and you certainly don't have to forgive someone who hasn't apologized. \n\nPetty me would get a small gift, something you can keep in your pocket, and when asked if you had a present for him, be like \"oh sure, BIL let's exchange presents\" and hold out your hands to receive what he has for you. That should be fun.\n\nAdult me would just say \"oh husband got him the present from both of us\" and if someone said something more about it, say \"well he hasn't given me anything in years so we thought a joint present would save him the embarrassment of not being able to give me something as I know he is struggling.\" Bonus point for a condescending head shake while delivering the line. \n\nAnd no, you don't need to actively support his recovery. Any program would be advising him that he should apologize to people, but also to not wrap his recovery in any one relationship. If his family makes a scene about you not supporting him, you can tell them- you are making this awkward and if you want to make a scene we can, but I believe a distant, respectable silence is probably preferred by everyone.\n\nFinally, you should also tell your husband it is his job to intervene when his parents harass you about this. Ignore texts and calls about it, and if they say it in person, say nothing and just turn turn and look at your husband, then excuse yourself.", "If I were you I'd refuse to be even in the same room wirh him.

I would throw away all social conventions of nicety\u2019s and tell them in graphic detail what BIL did/what you found in your not even year old infants room.\n\nIf that has already been said, and this is your husbands relations reaction\u2026..then honestly I would be low/no contact with them. \n\nBIL took advantage of your kindness and literally defiled a part of your home.\n\nLike I said, razed earth.\n\n(I\u2019m asking the above question just because your BIL already lied about the situation to others - paying you for allowing him to stay in your home - that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he told a highly edited and twisted version of events)", "Yeah, that\u2019s fucked up.
