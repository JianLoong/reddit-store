It was intentional and your husband was an a** for not insisting that you be a part of the family portrait because other spouses and partners were included.  Not including you was insult to you and shows you that they don\u2019t want to include you.

They would have asked and arranged a time for you to be included.\n\nI would be clear with your husband, that his responsibility when he married you was to put your needs over everyone else\u2019s desires, that\u2019s what the vow, forsaking all others means.
