I love him so much and he helps me avoid passing out and alerts when I need to eat sugar, he's playful and has never bitten anyone, though he looks a bit imposing, he has been properly trained and is a real service animal. His tasks keep me safe and prevent me from getting hurt.\n\nMy cousin 26F (Chloe) is a health nut. No sugar, no fat, no carbs kind of health nut. She knows about my health issues, but asked me not to bring my service dog because of his breed, that he'd scare her and her future husband's kids, as her toddler is afraid of large dogs, having been barked at in his face. I made the wedding slide show and all of the music was on my laptop so I had to be there. I told her I had to either be provided with sugar all night, in the form of several soft drinks or candies, or I would bring Angel with me along with my own sugar and she told me \"Fine, but you can live without junk for one night.\"\n\nI received a copy of the menu the morning of the wedding and surprise: no sugar, at all. None in the form of carbs, sweets, drinks or even in the cake with a large NO EXCEPTIONS written underneath. So I got dressed, filled my computer case with gummy candies (helping me to regulate sugar quickly) and harnessed up Angel for the night. I sat in the back away from the aisle through the ceremony and nobody noticed Angel. I then went to the venue for the reception and set up my music stand and the slideshow, the venue legally has to allow service animals and the employee was quite understanding, Angel alerted a few times while I was setting up and I was able to eat what I needed.\n\nWhen Chloe and her husband, and their kids arrived, she freaked seeing Angel (People had noticed him this time and I had explained he's a service animal). Her youngest (a toddler also noticed and started to cry as he is scared of big dogs.)He was in his vest and was laying down calm as could be. Before I could begin the music for their first dance she was at my music stand screaming at me that I was selfish for bringing Angel to her wedding and I could have gone one night without having to be the centre of attention and I could be healthy for once and not eat so much sugar. She kicked us out before dinner or the slide show, then sent me a nasty email saying I ruined her wedding and she expects me to pay her back for the missing slideshow and the music, even though I did her slideshow as a wedding gift and it took several days.\n\nI feel horrible I made her toddler cry and I feel like a total ass for bringing Angel, even though I need him on a day-to-day basis. AITA?\n\nETA: For people asking about my diet, I have ADHD and can forget to eat for days. I am also chronically underweight from an eating disorder I obtained from grades 6-11. I also struggle with object permanence. It is easier for me to remember bright candy than plain looking pills.

Your cousin wouldn't ask a diabetic to go without their insulin, or a person with asthma to go without their inhaler.\n\nYour dog is a service dog, to help with your medical condition, not there for fun and games or to terrorise your cousin's children,", "NTA. Depriving a family member of their service animal that alerts for health reasons is deplorable. Health is subjective; in your case, being healthy very literally *is* having sugar. Unless she'd've rather had you pass out at her wedding. I assume you'd have gotten called the center of attention for that, too.", "INFO: You say that she has two options; supply you with sugar or you'll need to bring your dog + your own sugar. \n\nWhat's the difference between the two? Why would her supplying you with sugary foods mean you don't need your dog but if you supply your own sugary foods, you do need your dog?", "NTA - your cousin keeps referring to what you need to eat as junk and unnecessary. Your cousin is the AH. Because that's not okay. You can't ask a person with a disability to just stop having it for a day because it's inconvenient. If you had that option, you wouldn't need a service animal.\n\nYour cousin is being irrational, selfish, and mean.\n\nRegardless of what type of dog your service dog is, you need him, end of story.\n\nTell her that she's ableist.", "NTA: she expected you to put yourself in an actual life threatening situation (no access to your service animal and to top that off, an inappropriate menu - I mean this is analogous to serving an allergen to a person with anaphylaxis). Then to turn around and have the effrontery to claim that you ruined her wedding when she threw you out- nah, she can bugger right off.", "Tell her she ought to apologize and pay you back for being a disgusting ableist.  NTA", "NTA and your cousin is awful. Working at a wedding isn\u2019t fun. Not having necessary medical equipment (your service dog) is life threatening. Oh no a toddler cried? It\u2019s a toddler and they cry ffs. \n\nThe only way you would be the asshole is to yourself, for not initially being firm about coming with your service dog or not coming at all. Your service dog is necessary to keep you safe and alive period and if she refuses to understand that she doesn\u2019t get to have your services / gifts.", "NTA- hypoglycemia is dangerous. You need to eat things that will raise your blood sugar (carbs), so you don't die. You have a very well trained service dog that alerts you before you start getting ill, so you can eat something. Your cousin said you could have neither. I personally think you should have said, then I'm not coming. Nobody's special day gets put above someone's health and safety.\n\nYou maybe could have helped soothe the toddler when they freaked out. Toddlers think everything that's brand new and large is scary, and in an ideal world the bride and groom are not the ones that stop to soothe the tiny children.", "NTA. It\u2019s a service dog and she sounds like a clueless and mean person who needs to deal with her own disordered thinking about food.", "Nta. But I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the wedding in the first place. She was already being antagonistic and obtuse before the ceremony and they told you the children would be scared just by the dog being there. (In your shoes) I would\u2019ve thanked her for the invite and politely declined over her not being accommodating to you under ADA laws, since she requested your services for the slideshow and music you were effectively a vendor. She kicked you out of the wedding and also hasn\u2019t compensated you for your time, if you feel petty enough take her to small claims court. You can argue the wedding invite was the payment, and since you didn\u2019t get to attend fully due to your service animal not being allowed to remain and the scene your cousin caused you are owed for your time to make the slideshow.", "NTA. She refused your service dig and refused to accommodate your diet.  Your only lithe option was not attending, which would have resulted in her freaking out anyway since she'd have no music.  You chose the right option.", "Not the asshole. \n\n\nYou've got a service dog for a reason, for your safety, to help manage your blood sugar levels when they get low. From what I'm reading about hypoglycemia, it's serious and the brain is the first one to be affected to the point where death can happen as a result of shortage to glucose in the brain. Your cousin is a toxic ableist and you don't need someone like her in your life.", "ESH. Her for obvious reasons. \n\nYou because she told you not to bring the dog and you did anyway and didn\u2019t tell her. Plus you disregarded a very real fear of a child. My son got jumped on by a dog when he was small and it can be traumatizing for young kids. He is still afraid of dogs years later. It doesn\u2019t matter that Angel was sitting down. \n\nYou also seem to be painting her in the worst light possible while trying to make yourself look completely innocent. Which seems suspicious. \n\nYou should have at the very least told her you were bringing Angel so she could keep her child away. You could also have chosen not to come if she didn\u2019t provide you with the needed sugar and also said you couldn\u2019t bring your dog. If she complained about the slideshow, you had every right to choose to stay home for your health. \n\nAs it was, seems like you\u2019re trying to act like you had no choice, but really you went with the choice that was easiest for you and put the mental health of a toddler in danger, instead of having the difficult conversations necessary to honor both yourself and her boundaries. You don\u2019t get to have it both ways.", "ESH.  This event should not have happened.  Cousin shouldn't have put your life at risk and you have no right to terrify a child with your dog.", "NTA \nBut I just wouldn\u2019t have gone as she was being ableist and dismissive beforehand.", "NTA \n\nEven though your cousin 'knows about your health condition' she has obviously no understanding of it and is completely ignorant.\n\nI would have told her though directly that if your proper service dog cannot accompany you, then you cant make it neither. Your safety is more important than being at her wedding.", "NTA, her telling you that you don\u2019t need to \u201cconstantly be the center of attention\u201d is exactly what she was doing. You need your service dog. NTA", "ESH. Sounds like you didn't really communicate to her that you were going to bring the dog after she told you not to bring it. You should have been more clear that if you didn't have the dog then you couldn't come. But Chloe sucks more for being so unaccommodating and for demanding money from you.", "NTA but I feel you just shouldn't have gone. It was never going to end well.", "YTA, she told you to not bring the dog. It's her wedding if you can't go without the dog, don't go to the wedding. You should have asked her permission to bring the dog before agreing to do the music and slideshow.", "ESH. You knew how to moderate yourself without the dog.", "ESH. You probably should have made it absolutely clear that you absolutely had to have your dog. If she was actually a good friend she could have taken the time to socialize the kids with the dog because fear of dogs is something that would be good for them to overcome. HOWEVER, she doesn\u2019t sound reasonable and seems to treat you pretty badly. She hasn\u2019t taken the time to understand your illness and seems pretty mean about it. Is this a friend you really want?", "NTA. But only because of her not wanting you to eat sugar.  Had she not done that, it would have been e s h.  Too over the top.  You were not invited to come with your dog.  That means you can\u2019t come with the dog. Therefore you should have told her that you couldn\u2019t come because she is an AH.  And ableist.  And not brought the video.  But, you cannot go to someone\u2019s party with an SD, when they don\u2019t want them.  You just *can\u2019t*.  She did have a legitimate reason with the child.  Of course she is an AH to the child, in not helping the kid learn to cope, life will require the kid deal with dogs in their environment.  But, people have a right to not have service dogs at their own party.  They are sometimes AHs for enforcing it, sometimes not, depending on the situation.  But, they have that right, and good handlers respect it.  I have an SD, am active in the community, and this is the common opinion.", "NTA, she knows you need Angel", "NTA\n\nYou owe her nothing. Not even an apology.", "NTA, you told her what was going on & suggested an alternative. If she didn't want a dog she should've compromised and had sugar available.\n\nJust out of curiousity, but how does Angel know? Are there like small hints in your body language?", ">\"Fine, but you can live without junk for one night.\"\n\nDoes she realize that you literally can not?\n\nThat is the whole point of the dog? \n\nAnd even if she did pay your for the slide show and music, you showed up with it ready to go, but you were told to leave. That is on her. \n\nNTA", "ESH", "NTA. Depriving you of your aid and not providing you with sugar, which you medically need, because she's a 'health nut' is ridiculous, and abuse.\n\nAlso, people who judge dogs by their breed are just AHs regardless of the situation.", "NTA. Your friend ruined her own wedding. You have a medical condition and your dog is a medical necessity. Send her a text back saying you aren't putting yourself medically at risk because your friend does not understand or care about medical needs and you hope for her kids sake that they never develop a similar condition because she would not take care of them. She sounds incredibly controlling and entitled.\n\nConsult a lawyer about your situation if she chooses to try and sue you for any wedding costs.", "NTA. She wanted you to go without sugar and without your dog. You made it clear that it was either unlimited sugar or limited sugar and your dog. \nShe created a damned if you do damned if you don't situation where you couldn't win whatever you did. \n\nYou don't have that dog ir the sugar for attention or because you like it, you NEED it.\n\nGive her a big FU and she can shove any compensation for a GIFT for crying out loud up her ass. She kicked you out for having sugar and a service dog with you. Then she doesn't get to complain she didn't have the slideshow or music.", "NTA. This is insane. I know you\u2019re not diabetic and while I\u2019m not up to date on your condition, I\u2019m an ex nurse and I have some small understanding. Also, my son is type 1 and if someone spoke about his dietary requirements and general existence in the way she did to you, they\u2019d be dead to me. This is inexcusable.

Referring to junk just shows she doesn't know or care that sugar is medically necessary for you. It's horrible that people have that attitude. I remember recently reading another story on here where the OP was diabetic and a guest in a friend's home who blocked her from accessing the kitchen when her blood sugar was falling because it would set a bad example to the kids if she ate snacks before they were allowed to, she nearly collapsed instead and had to call an ambulance! Ignorance can be so dangerous. Of course you can't just \"decide to be healthy\".

There is absolutely no rational reason to rely on one over a CGM if you truly are at risk of life-threatening hypoglycemia. \n\nThere are, however, plenty of people who \"train their service dogs\" to perform dubious \"tasks\" for their potentially dubious disability so that they can take their pet places, because they're anxious without their pet, or straight up for attention. \n\nNot medical advice, just general info:\n\n\"Hypoglycemic unawareness\" is not a diagnosis in itself, it just means you don't experience the typical \"warning\" symptoms of hypoglycemia or only experience them at a very low blood sugar. Normal healthy people do not experience (significant) hypoglycemia that they would need to be aware of. Hypoglycemic unawareness typically arises after years of experiencing regular lows, such as with insulin-treated diabetics. \n\nThere are many causes/types of non-diabetic hypoglycemia, some of them typically benign and some quite serious. If OP has worked with a doctor on this, the fact that they only call their condition \"hypoglycemic unawareness\" is a concerning lack of knowledge at best. A relatively common cause of non-diabetic hypoglycemia is reactive hypoglycemia, which is in essence when your body responds to carbs (especially a big influx of simple carbs like, idk, soda) with too much insulin. Usually the first step in management is cutting back on simple carbs, eating more fiber, combining carbs with protein and fat when you do eat them and so on.\n\nFor more severe cases of hypoglycemia that aren't curable, they can give someone medication that suppresses how much insulin they produce, or in extreme cases even remove part or all of the pancreas. That degree of hypoglycemia is not something you would just be managing at home with a dog you trained to tell you to chug mtn dew. \n\nEven if OP for some reason cannot use a CGM for their condition that is apparently so life-threatening that being without their dog for a few hours could prove fatal for some reason, there's nothing stopping them from just bringing a regular fingerstick meter with them and testing frequently (and then consuming a reasonable bit of sugar if needed.) But that would make too much sense, wouldn't it.\n\nOP never mentions testing their blood sugar or any specific numbers, in a comment states that they have normal insulin levels (which... makes absolutely no sense in the context of hypoglycemia unless you are injecting insulin too... what exactly is happening to the sugar then?) and states that they experience \"severe abdominal pain\" from hypoglycemia when they don't have sugar or the dog, which both doesn't make a lick of sense and also, having identifiable symptoms of hypoglycemia by definition would mean that you are not unaware of your hypoglycemia. \n\nThe dog apparently alerted her a \"few\" times within a (presumably) few hour or less window while setting up at the reception, and she ate multiple times in response. Again, where exactly is all this sugar up and disappearing to if you have normal insulin levels?  Being unaware of hypoglycemia does not magically siphon the sugar out of your body. Does op typically wake up every hour for sugar if their dog is alerting so frequently?\n\nThe whole story sounds ridiculous and made up anyways, but on the off chance it's true, maybe OP should be working both with their doctor to correctly manage their medical condition, and with a therapist to address other potential issues.", "I was just about to ask.... if she needs to consume that much sugar how are her teeth not rotted out?

Relying on candy to keep your sugars up as a baseline isn\u2019t a great idea, really only to treat a low blood sugar. Might want to look into getting a continuous glucose monitor and eating carb containing meals at regular intervals ideally mixed meals.", "Or a usb with porn and Two Live Crew... both mislabeled because this bride probably isn't checking anything before she plays it because who would have the nerve to mess up her wedding?\n\n\n\n\nOk...

I do several things to keep my blood sugar at a good level throughout the day and I very rarely have blood sugar crashes any more. It's when I have TOO much sugar that I feel awful so I have a very low sugar diet except for natural sugars from fruit or the occasional sweet after a meal.  I eat small meals or snacks every 3-4 hours. I eat a lot of protein, healthy fats, whole grains and vegetables like plain yogurt with granola, nuts, cheese, crackers, healthier granola bars, fruits, etc. Except for my morning coffee I pretty much only drink water or sugar free drinks. If I have even a half can of full sugar soda I feel like crap a few hours later because it spikes my blood sugar and then I get the crash after. I'm super confused by this post and why she NEEDS to go through a 6 pack of full sugar soda per night PLUS sugary candy too for hypoglycemia. That would literally kill me. Something isn't right here.", "My guess is that the venue required something like a \"no outside food or drink\" statement on the invite/RSVP card for liquor license rules, and they took it personally.\n\nAlso, if OP is shotgunning soda on a regular basis, I bet they do get lots of comments from family members who are worried about their health or judgey.", "Yep, I am in a wheelchair, in considerable pain and get told all the time that if I would just get up and move around, my pain would magically disappear and I would no longer need the wheelchair.
