{"id": 30838, "submission_id": "17tl4jy", "title": "AITA for Yelling at my Wife for Siding with my Five Year Old Son", "selftext": "So about twenty minutes ago, I saw my five year old kid on the floor spinning in circles with sharp scissors. I asked him to stop nicely because it was a dangerous situation. He didn't listen to me. I asked a few more times, slightly raising my voice and the urgency of the situation, and he eventually stopped.\n\nI asked him to hand me the scissors and he kicked them at me. I told him to try handing them to me again. He hucked them at me. I tried once more to get him to hand them over kindly. He aimed them at me and started jabbing the air in my direction with the scissors.\n\nI kind of exploded at him because the situation was becoming dangerous. He got scared and dropped the scissors. He started crying and asking why I was yelling at him. I took them away. I told him to go sit down in a time out while I figured out how to deal with the situation.\n\nThis is not about me and my kid but just a preface to why I am so mad right now. I agree I might've handled that situation better but I saw a bladed implement being aimed at me and reacted.\n\nI am more asking AITA about what happened with my wife. Ten minutes passed and so I asked my kid to come talk to me. When he came and sat down to talk my wife started yelling at me that I was being too serious. In my eyes safety comes first, not emotions. My wife yelled at me that I needed to let it go.\n\nI started telling her that if she didn't care about my physical safety than she can stay out of the conversation. (She often is controlling when it comes to me instituting talks and consequences with our kids.) She told me I was being a jerk.\n\nI had the convo with my five year old where I explained that no matter what we never aim scissors at anyone like that. That if we do that we will probably be getting screamed at because of the danger to others. He was upset he got yelled at. I told him that didn't matter in comparison to threatening someone with scissors.\n\nFast forward a bit. I ended the ten minute talk with my kid and he went back to playing. My wife came at me saying I was being an asshole and super intense. I told her of course, my safety was at risk so I responded to the threat how I would to anyone pointing scissors at me and jabbing them violently in the air.\n\nShe said I was over-reacting, that I'm an adult and shouldn't yell at five year olds. As a side note I almost never yell. When I did it really freaked my kid out. I am usually super calm and understanding about stuff.\n\nI am so upset about this and the fact that she tried to shut me down over what I see as a valid concern that I'm shaking. So as always, AITA or is she the asshole? Or are we both assholes? I sincerely want to know because at this point I'm just angry and pissed off about the whole affair.", "created_utc": 1699798636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tl4jy/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wife_for_siding_with_my/", "score": 1520, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He didn't listen to me. I asked a few more times, slightly raising my voice and the urgency of the situation, and he eventually stopped.\n\nInfo: Did you tell him how dangerous the situation was? Why did you not try and remove the scissors when they were a danger to your child?", "Listen, you two have to get a better handle on parenting. \n\nThis asking repeatedly and being ignored is not good. Throwing things at you?\n\nIt's not good he had the scissors, it's also not good that it took scissors for you to react with any strength to this parenting problem. It's not good that your wife still isn't reacting to this. \n\nHow it should have gone:\n\n*I saw my five year old kid on the floor spinning in circles with sharp scissors. I asked him to stop nicely because it was a dangerous situation. He didn't listen to me.\n\nI got up and walked over to him and plucked the dangerous scissors out of his hand. I then gently scolded him for ignoring me and pointed out that scissors are dangerous and need to be used carefully. I told him he could try again with scissors another day. My child was protected and there was so further unsafe situation. My wife and I had a calm reasonable conversation about how he got the scissors, and whether there are other things we need to move out of my son's reach*\n\nESH", "Why did it only become dangerous when he pointed them at you? Not when he kicked them or threw them? Were you giving him the scissors back to him each time? And if he was spinning in circles with them, how the hell is that not dangerous to start with? \n\nIn my opinion, you take the dangerous object away first, then explain what the problem is so they understand it. You take it away before it escalates into kicking or throwing said object. It just seems like common sense, but I've only babysat before I'm  not a parent, so I could be wrong. \n\nWhy was he left alone with them in the first place? You said his mother was there. What happened to her?", "ESH. It's important to teach kids about safety, but realistically, a supervised 5yo is not going to do THAT much damage with scissors. The way you describe it sounds like you were being threatened with a loaded gun, which suggests that your overall response was not proportionate. I'm not saying you shouldn't have taken it seriously, but you can do that without exploding. \n\nYour wife could have handled the situation better by pulling you aside to talk about it in a different room instead of yelling at you in front of your kid.\n\nThere's a healthy middle ground between underreacting and overreacting, and you guys need to find it.\n\nTake a breather and let yourselves calm down. I know parenting is tough and none of us handle things perfectly 100% of the time.\n\nEdit: If you read this post and got from it that I don't think parents should teach their kids to use scissors safely, please work on your reading comprehension.", "Please give me those scissors \n\nNo \n\nTakes scissors \n\nWhole thing over 19 3/4 minutes ago \n\nYTA", "Why were the scissors where a 5 year old could grab them?\n\nDude, it's a 5 year old. Take the scissors. Don't play stupid games or one of you is gonna win a stupid prize. Be a parent and grab the scissors instead of yelling. YTA", "I can't imagine why you did not simply take the scissors from them immediately.", "ESH. you both are terrible parents. the situation didn't get dangerous at the 'hand 'em over' exchange, it started that way. you don't make several requests for a sharp object and then allow several dangerous attempts to hand them over nicely. you take the object, explain why we don't play with them, and put them out of reach. the end. you allowed this to go on for WAY too long, which gave your kid multiple opportunities to hurt himself and others. \n\nyou also went from teddy bear to terminator in a blink, which is equally problematic. \n\nyour wife has a point about the level of intensity you rose to, but disagreeing with you in front of the child and insisting this wasn't a big deal is divisive to your respective authority as well as sending mixed messages to the kid. \n\nyou both need parenting classes before someone loses an eye.", "INFO: \n\nHow did your child keep getting hold of the scissors? And what exactly did you say to him each time?\n\nInstance one - he was making pompoms with his mom, using adult scissors, and yet somehow ended up spinning with them. Was she not supervising him at that point? But then, after you repeatedly asked \"nicely\" for him to stop, and asked a few more times more firmly, he kicked the scissors at you. Were you actually trying to explain to him that it was dangerous, or did you try simply telling him to stop playing with scissors in hand?\n\nInstance one finished with him kicking them at you. Is it possible he was confused by instructions to put down the scissors and to give you the scissors?\n\nInstance two started with you telling him to try handing them to you again. So presumably you handed them back to him? Before you let him get his hands on the scissors the second time, did you demonstrate how to safely hand them over and try to explain why he needed to be careful? Or did you hand them over then try to tell him what to do?\n\nInstance two ended with him throwing them at you. At that point, did he throw the scissors in anger/pique, or was he trying to return them to you in a lazy fashion?\n\nInstance three.... Well, the main question here is why the heck did you let him have the scissors a third time? Did actually you hand them back to him, or did he snatch them up before you could get them safely away? And then he started pointing/stabbing the scissors in your direction...\n\nThe one thing you seem to have done right is stepping away to calm down and think it through, instead of *continuing* yelling at him.\n\nIf you want to have a conversation about safe handling and use of things like scissors, you need to start it before he is given access to them, not after. If you are concerned he is not treating something like scissors safely, you need to sit down and have a calm conversation with him before you let him have them back.\n\nWhich leads me to:\n\n>She often is controlling when it comes to me instituting talks and consequences with our kids\n\nBy this, do you mean that your wife tries to stop you from having talks about consequences because she wants to be the one to do it? Or does your wife not like your kids to be spoken to/with about risks and consequences at all? If the latter, is she trying to avoid difficult conversations because she was herself raised in a restrictive household and doesn't want the same for her kids?\n\nYou escalated the situation and the risk by repeatedly giving your son the opportunity to mishandle the scissors. You are the one, along with your wife, who was yelling.  Did this disagreement between you and your wife take place in front of your son?\n\nAnd in your explanation, you apparently referred to the danger to you. Did you at any point mention that you were concerned for his own safety?", "I\u2019m a little concerned about how you appear much more concerned over your safety than your child\u2019s. When it was just your kid at risk of being harmed by the scissors you were calm and didn\u2019t explain the danger or take them away. But when it was you, you freaked out. The whole post you talk about how *your* safety was at risk, not mentioning your child\u2019s risk. Even when you talked about it with your kid afterwards you again talked about your safety and seemed to fail to communicate the danger they were in (unless you just didn\u2019t include you doing that in the post). Also the response to your kid when they communicated being upset about being yelled at was that it \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d. Your kid will interpret that as their feelings don\u2019t matter. Instead you could\u2019ve said something like \u201cI know yelling is scary and I don\u2019t like scaring you. But I have to make an exception when safety is at risk so no one gets hurt\u201d. And by your comments, you say that you probably did overreact due to triggers. So I would also now apologize to your kid, acknowledge you overreacted, tell him you\u2019ll do better in the future, and you can even explain that this was a particularly scary situation for you. But please make sure they understand that they put themselves in danger too and why they cannot play with scissors/other sharp things.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I believe you made quite a few mistakes in interacting with your son, you saw the issue through to the end, communicated to your son what was the most important and had a reconciliation period with him.\n\nI believe you should have confiscated the scissors immediately and had the stern talk with him much earlier. \\[I certainly do not think you should have returned them to your son while he was already in an agitated state.\\]\n\nI disagree with your wife that it is inappropriate to yell at children when they are doing something dangerous. Though I see her point, I think you are taking the matter a little too personally.\n\nI also strongly believe your wife should not have attempted to intervene in your follow up conversation with your son because that was necessary for him to know that your anger was temporary and not a rejection of him. And at five years old your wife should know and respect that kind of parenting style. \\[Edit: Then again maybe you should have told her what you were about to do.\\]", "NTA based on what I'm reading. You didn't start by yelling, you calmly asked your 5 yr old to stop doing something that was potentially dangerous, when they didn't stop you asked again more sternly. Your child reacted as many that age do, with defiance, and then they did something that could have hurt you and you yelled at them in reaction which scared them but stopped the dangerous situation. \n\nYou never acted out of anger, and later explained to your child why you did what you did and why what they were doing was dangerous, not sure what your wife has an issue with.", "Your kid is using scissors in a manner that will cause damage or is dangerous.  You take the scissors off the child, explain what the problem is - but you don't give them back until they understand what they did was wrong.  You don't give them a chance to throw the scissors or make stabbing actions.   You de-escalate immediately, otherwise you turn it into a game. \n\nYTA for allowing the situation to escalate.   A 5 year old child should not be using scissors unsupervised.", "YTA you\u2019re the adult, you don\u2019t have a stand off with a 5 yo child, you asked for the scissors he refused to give them to you, you take them. You weren\u2019t in danger and indicated otherwise is ridiculous. Your wife is right you handled the situation poorly.", "I once had to walk a kid to the office for literally jamming scissors up his nose. Scissors can be dangerous for sure and if I got scissors thrown at me, there would be consequences. I think you and your wife were both too heated. She's mad you yelled, and you shouldn't have yelled. You're mad she didn't take it seriously. ESH. Better communicating and less yelling.", "ESH. \n\nYou say you asked him nicely to stop and then repeated yourself a few more times due to the \u201curgency\u201d but it wasn\u2019t until he tried to jab you with them that you got upset. \n\nThis is a one and done situation due to the dangers and I\u2019m hopeful that you\u2019ll take note of that for any future occurrences. When they\u2019re putting themselves in danger first and foremost you cannot give them further opportunities to do just that.\n\nI\u2019m all for giving chances and explaining the dangers of certain things - funnily enough my child did the exact same thing a few months ago with the kitchen scissors she climbed up and grabbed from the block. She thought she was just dancing with a prop. \n\nWhile you don\u2019t always have to resort straight to yelling at them to stop, you absolutely can and should have certain moments be a one chance and it\u2019s over kinda thing. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t condone him trying to jab at you with them, you as the adult allowed the situation to escalate unnecessarily until it became a danger to *you* - That makes you TA right there. \n\nYour wife is also slightly TA because you both need to be on the same page with consequences and communication, but you\u2019re putting the focus of this talk on how dangerous he was being towards you and not the actual problem which was him goofing around with them and endangering himself.", "ESH.\n\nYou definitely could have handled the situations better, and you have admitted that. I understand that you were trying to teach him not to throw objects, especially sharp ones, at people. However, you have an energetic 5 year old who definitely doesn't understand why you're yelling at him to hand the scissors nicely. \n\nAs for your wife, I don't understand why she is yelling at you. You were trying to explain to your kid the dangers of dealing with sharp objects, and meanwhile, she is yelling at you for what? Because the kid was crying? Where was she when your son got a hold of the scissors? Why wasn't she there to stop him? What does she think would have happened if she caught your son with the scissors, asked him to give them back, and he chose to kick or throw them at her? She would probably be just as mad.", "I was talking with an insurance adjuster and he told me his worse case was someone was walking down a carpeted hall carrying pencils, tripped, and literally poked their eye out.\n\nThere is a reason that every young child has blunted scissors without sharp points and we are taught to never run with scissors or knives.\n\nI don't think it takes 10 minutes to get that idea across to a 5 year old though.\n\nNTA - mostly. You might read some parenting books though.\n\nYour wife was also overly permissive. Somewhere in the middle is the place you should be aiming.", "ESH. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be angry at a 5 year old for playing with scissors, his parents should have made sure risky items like that are locked away. You wasted time in a potentially dangerous situation trying to make him hand them over \u201cproperly\u201d instead of just removing the risk. You seem more concerned about your safety than his because he was jabbing them around, but he\u2019s 5 he could\u2019ve hurt himself! You and your wife are both yelling and undermining each other in front of your child, which is toxic. You can discipline and educate children without shouting.", "NTA.  How many people have lost their eyesight in similar situations.\n\nYour wife doesn't know how lucky she is.  You can't compromise with this.", "Nta. Kids are jerks sometimes and your wife is not being reasonable.", "ESH.  Both parents overreacted, and you and your wife really need to get on the same page about parenting issues, because having your child watch you fight about everything is going to cause a lot of damage in the long run.  Also, why did a 5yo have sharp scissors in the first place?  Why not just give him a steak knife to play with?", "Your kid pushed pretty hard! Your reaction was appropriate. \nI know someone who almost lost an eye from having a pair of scissors thrown at their face.", "I get the feeling your wife doesn\u2019t let you parent? NTA and your wife is.", "YTA for not 1) Picking him up and 2) Removing the scissors from him.\nThe bigger question for me is, we\u2019re the scissors \u201cadult\u201d ones? And if so, why does a 5yo have access to them?", "Nta. Your wife is weird. And it was shitty of her to try to override your parenting in this situation and validate that it was ok for your 5yr to do what he did. I can guarantee that it wasn't about your child and more about her power trip or whatever the fuck she's on. \n We've all yelled and lost our shit at our kid no matter how calm you try to approach things. It happens.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m curious how did your wife want to handle it?  \nYour son was doing something dangerous.  You raised your voice.  Put him in a time out then explained to him why he was in trouble.  What would she have done if he was swinging sharp scissors in her direction?", "You were all concerned about 'being in danger' when kid pointed/threw scissors at you. Nowhere do you show any concern for your kid  jabbing himself or falling on the scissors. You should have taken them away at once and then had 'the talk'. \nAnd be more concerned for kid's safety than your own.\nWife overreacted but YTA bc of above.", "ESH the second that your son started spinning with those scissors doing the arts and crafts with his mom was the moment they should of been told no.  That is 100% on both of you as parents to correct.  Now on to the two of you separately.\n\nYou saw your son in a dangerous situation and tried gently to give him back.  He refused to and after a few times he kicked the sharp object over to you.  You should of grabbed them at that point. Instead you tried to teach him the proper way to hand them to you. Instead he threw the sharp scissors at you. You definitely should of taken them back at that moment and talked to him then.  You still wanted to teach that proper way and now he thinks this is a game. So what does he do oh he pretends it\u2019s a weapon and you yelled at him.  He got scared and stopped doing it. He then got punished for it.  You were a AH to your own safety by giving the scissors back to him.  He definitely needed to go in time out and have a lesson about what not to do with scissors so you are fine there.  Though you should apologize for scaring him when you yelled but you got scared he was going to hurt himself. \n\nWife though is an AH because she gave him very sharp scissors and didn\u2019t stop him the second he got up.  She sat there and watched what son was doing and didn\u2019t try to correct it at all. Not only was your safety at risk when he threw the scissors at you but so was sons when he kicked it.  What if it kicked up towards his face or he didn\u2019t let go in the throw but stabbed his own eye.  You said she doesn\u2019t allow any sort of punishment when he does stuff wrong.  That is setting him up for failure.\n\nYour wife reads like a mom who wants to coddle him and never teach him right from wrong.  This kind of parenting is what leads to boys doing things they shouldn\u2019t because consequences are foreign to them. \n\nYou need to sit down with your wife and discuss with her the harsh reality.  If you don\u2019t teach proper safety now with sharp scissors what will he do with other sharp objects later.  What if on the playground he saw a sharp piece of glass and pretended it was a knife and actually stabbed a kid. What if he found a needles and stabbed some other kid because he thought it was an ok game.  It may seem like a over reaction in the moment but your son needs to learn to be safe.", "YTA.  For dragging this out.  You ask once for the scissors and if your child doesn\u2019t hand them over you take them.  This entire encounter should have taken under 10 seconds.", "NTA - many mothers someone have issues with their children being raised \"harsh\", even if that is really soft compared to what the situation demands.\n\nit sucks but at the same time children need to be coddled and looked after in a way mothers like that do best. you arent the ass and neither is your wife for disagreeing with you.\n\nmaybe both of you suck tho for raising your kid in a way where is doesnt \"stand at attention\" once you raise your voice. but then again, kids forget and push boundaries all tze time so id almost say NAH (your wife needs to bring her concerns while the kid isnt there tho, that makes her an ass)", "YTA stop saying your safety was at risk.

Only one Ah here: YOU", "Reading your story and then your comments, including that you have triggers from childhood, I'm gonna say NTA but I think communication is key here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. communicating with your child. He's five and so lacks common sense. He didn't get why you were so mad.\n2. Maybe communicating better with your wife, and she with you. Does she know about your past? I think you both need to cool off and have a conversation.\n\nI don't think either of you are bad parents or anything. I think you just got scared and made a mistake in the moment.", "In your story there's a lot going on. There's overreaction on all three sides. The only one who gets a pass is the kid. Because he isn't old enough to know better. So that being said I'm going to talk about the most important part of this saga. The way you and your wife are parenting. This is a big problem. And it's only going to get worse. Now I'm going to be really sexist so if that's a trigger for you, stop reading. Men and women are very different in how they perceive things and how they react to things. Men look at the mechanics of what's going on and react mechanically. That's why the stabbing motion bothered you so much. But honestly it was never dangerous as you said. He's a child. If he came at you with his full might he would not be able to seriously hurt you without some really good luck. That's the truth. Your wife didn't see it as all that dangerous and her momma bear came out. The violence she saw was you yelling. She felt the need to protect her baby. Now your reaction to her reaction felt like she was choosing him over you. You felt like as a dad this was an important lesson for your baby. So there was daddy bear, being challenged by momma bear. And that became the biggest issue. Not teaching your son a valuable lesson about sharp things. My wife and I got into this type of battle when my son was about 13. As a teenager he was testing boundaries. Being dad, I took the opportunity to teach him lessons. My wife looked at her little boy's sweet face and melted. I'd give him a punishment, like restricting him to the house after school for a few days. I'd come home from work and he's nowhere to be found because she dropped him off at the beach to go surfing. When I asked her why she'd do that when I had put him on restriction, her answer was \"he's been doing so much better\". Duh, he's not an idiot. He gets that the punishment was designed for him to adjust his behavior. This went on and got worse. It made my marriage a living hell. Everytime she undercut my discipline it put a wider gap between us. And my son learned all about manipulation. Fortunately he turned out to be a man I was very proud of. As he matured, he respected me more than he did my wife. Because what I was trying to do made sense at the time and still. But as a kid he got into unnecessary trouble because of his mother not letting me teach him how to avoid it. \n\nYou and your wife need to have a serious conversation about how you and she are going to discipline your son. You can have different options. But interference is absolutely not allowed unless one of you strike the boy. That is the only time. Otherwise, if something happens that one of you doesn't like, AFTER the other is finished you can go to a private place and discuss it. Both of you need to listen to each other and never let your son see disagreement between you two in regards to him. He will play that card every time. And in the meantime he will have to learn from the world instead of from his parents. And those world lessons are much worse.", "Nta. Wife an a hole. Her parenting style will do him great harm.", "Nta and I\u2019m surprised by some of these responses you were trying to be patient with your kid and teach them.

Regardless, you then asked for him to give you the scissors and he kicked them at you. I understand wanting to teach kids manners and appropriate behaviour, but there\u2019s a time and a place. Again, at this point, you should have taken the scissors (thus removing the danger) and THEN had a conversation with him about safety/why you asked him to stop, along with explaining why you shouldn\u2019t kick scissors/how to safely handle scissors (again, remembering that *he is 5*). Instead, you gave them back to try again and *he then chucked them at you. He threw the scissors at you/in your direction and you STILL gave them back for a third try*. It stopped being a learning/teaching moment the minute he ignored your first request to stop, everything after that only increases the danger.\n\nYour wife is also an AH for clearly not understanding/ignoring what was happening and why you got angry.

I don't really include him in the moral analysis because he's 5, and 5 year old kids do not yet have the use of reason.\n\nYou yelling at your kid is not only a bit mean (although I only give you a little bit of AH here because it was a dangerous situation where he needed to listen to you) but doesn't seem to be working. If he kicked the scissors at you then, assuming they were in reach, you should have immediately taken the scissors, made the scene safe, and THEN talked to him about safety and obedience. Handing them back to him so he could try to give them to you properly, was madness. \n\nDoes your child often react in an oppositional way when you give him directions? That may be a clue to the problem.\n\nYour biggest issue here is your wife, who seems to have no concept of the seriousness of the safety issue here.

I asked him to stop nicely because it was a dangerous situation. He didn't listen to me. I asked a few more times, slightly raising my voice and the urgency of the situation, and he eventually stopped.\n\nI asked him to hand me the scissors and he kicked them at me. I told him to try handing them to me again. He hucked them at me. I tried once more to get him to hand them over kindly. He aimed them at me and started jabbing the air in my direction with the scissors.\n\nI kind of exploded at him because the situation was becoming dangerous. He got scared and dropped the scissors. He started crying and asking why I was yelling at him. I took them away. I told him to go sit down in a time out while I figured out how to deal with the situation.\n\nThis is not about me and my kid but just a preface to why I am so mad right now. I agree I might've handled that situation better but I saw a bladed implement being aimed at me and reacted.\n\nI am more asking AITA about what happened with my wife. Ten minutes passed and so I asked my kid to come talk to me. When he came and sat down to talk my wife started yelling at me that I was being too serious. In my eyes safety comes first, not emotions. My wife yelled at me that I needed to let it go.\n\nI started telling her that if she didn't care about my physical safety than she can stay out of the conversation. (She often is controlling when it comes to me instituting talks and consequences with our kids.) She told me I was being a jerk.\n\nI had the convo with my five year old where I explained that no matter what we never aim scissors at anyone like that. That if we do that we will probably be getting screamed at because of the danger to others. He was upset he got yelled at. I told him that didn't matter in comparison to threatening someone with scissors.\n\nFast forward a bit. I ended the ten minute talk with my kid and he went back to playing. My wife came at me saying I was being an asshole and super intense. I told her of course, my safety was at risk so I responded to the threat how I would to anyone pointing scissors at me and jabbing them violently in the air.\n\nShe said I was over-reacting, that I'm an adult and shouldn't yell at five year olds. As a side note I almost never yell. When I did it really freaked my kid out. I am usually super calm and understanding about stuff.\n\nI am so upset about this and the fact that she tried to shut me down over what I see as a valid concern that I'm shaking. So as always, AITA or is she the asshole? Or are we both assholes? I sincerely want to know because at this point I'm just angry and pissed off about the whole affair.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You go in, restrain him enough to stop him from doing the dangerous behavior, and remove the sharp thing or whatever.  *Then* have the serious talk.", "I get it. I've had moments where my kids have pushed all my buttons at lightning speed, and I've just lost my shit. Not proud of it, but it happens.

Then you sit down and have a calm conversation about safety and how important it is. If you can't have it in that moment, have it shortly after\n\nBut you didn't prioritise safety and that's pretty clear to both us and - I'd imagine - your child as well. \"Give X to so-and-so nicely\" isn't about safety, it's about how you interact with others and treat them well. And forcing that in this moment was about obedience\n\nIf the situation was already unsafe by that point, then why did you escalate it even further? If it wasn't yet unsafe but you had safety concerns, why escalate? I get reacting to danger and scaring your kid - regardless of whether or not it's the right reaction, I understand it. But you created that scenario by escalating it to that point\n\nAnd telling your wife that shit about her not having concern for your safety is not the kind of thing your kid should be hearing.

Yelling and punishing are no substitute for teaching, and reacting quickly and calmly when necessary is important.", "The mother was doing projects with the kid that's how the scissors were in the child hands and left him to go get coffee without taking the scissors away\n\nI don't think he's an ah because he didn't immediately yell. He tried repeatedly speaking calmly with his son to convince him to stop and hand over the scissors.\n\nAlso a cut placed in the 'right' place can cause death or blindness etc so op being super sensitive and aware of this through his experience tried his best.\n\nIs there room for improvement? Sure.\n\nBut he was attentive , recognized the danger and tried calmly without startling or scaring (in the beginning ) the child to remove the dangerous item.", "lol it\u2019s a real phenomenon.\n\nI bartender and then nannied before I started working at an animal shelter (aka all situations that need commanding voices) and the other day my SO almost walked into traffic and I unconsciously said \u201cSTAY!\u201d\u2026.and he listened \n\nAfter we realized what I\u2019d done we both just sort of stared at each other and then laughed", "Absolutely, but that should be done when the child is calm, not when they're clearly determined to push buttons and not listen. As a parent I've learned the hard way that trying to teach a disregulated kid is a total waste of time and often results in more conflict and a power struggle. Remove the danger, let the kid (and yourself) calm down, and then go over the expectation with them. It works much, much better.", "Next time. When someone is handling a dangerous item in an unsafe manner, priority #1 is getting the dangerous item away from them. They you can then practice with safety scissors, a set of tongs, or literally any other item.\n\nLike,if you saw a 5 year old with a gun, step one isn't teaching them to check the safety, handing it back to them each time they fail to do it correctly.\n\nObviously a gun and household scissors are not the same level of danger, but OP *was* right that those scissors in the hands of a misbehaving 5 year old was dangerous. *Repeatedly handing a misbehaving child* a pair of sharp scissors was an incredibly stupid move.", "Right, but not when they or you are already escalated, angry, or not seriously engaged in the exchange. This was not the time.", "No! You do that by safely passing them to wife to put them away, you don't give the kid back a sharp object.

Actually removing the item also removes the possibility of Grievous Bodily Harm (one of the Four Other Riders of the Apocalypse). You can then practice with literally any other item, but safety scissors in particular would be a good stand-in.", "We're on Am I the asshole, value judgement is kinda the point here. \n\n\nBesides how are you making him engage in a safer form of the behaviour by making him pick up the scissors?

Our unspoken deal was that, once the car stopped, she would deal with her baby, and I would deal with her toddler. So, I parked, my friend and I got out, we each got our assigned child out of his car seat, and we began walking toward the store. My friend was carrying her baby, and when I went to get the toddler's attention so I could take his hand, I automatically made those kissy sounds you make to get a dog to come to you.

Which is why we don't leave them unsupervised even when we think everything is babyproofed enough.\n\nBut what I didn't do in that scenario was have the child repeatedly practice handing me the knife.

There was no moment with an actual real world danger to anyone. \n\nThere was plenty of behavior that should be stopped or that could over time escalate to some dangerous situation. But even the stabbing like moment, nope, 5 years old moving scissors at your direction is NOT a danger to adult. Spinning scissors should be stopped, but is not an actual danger. Same with kicking it. Should be stopped, no acute danger.", "Expecting an adult to listen for 10 min about a lecture on scissor safety is pushing it, too.

He now does it back to me to get my attention.", "Ok, yeah, if the 5 year old is being an active participant in the conversation, and there are also safety demonstrations - showing how to use scissors safely, not just telling how to use them safely - then 10 minutes can be an appropriate time frame. \n\nI think I\u2019m being realistic. Have you ever sat down and seen how long 10 minutes actually is?

What if he had been in a classroom or preschool setting? Not following instructions of the person in charge. The hurling or jabbing activity would have gotten him suspended or expelled.

The timeout was appropriate for the child\u2019s age and the discussion on the danger was necessary; everyone should have calmed down by that time. The discussion opens the conversation on why it\u2019s dangerous and the need to listen/respect authority. Mom was more concerned with hurting the child\u2019s feelings, his crying.

Don't ask him to hand them to you. For sure don't ask multiple times. Tell him quit spinning and hand over the scissors. Once.

Very few of us like to be interrupted while we are doing something enjoyable. \n\nMake it so he can do what is fun, and help him get back to it as soon as possible by helping him remove the scissors from the equation. \n\nAs it happened he didn't get to learn everything he could from spinning because it devolved into yelling and tears.  If you see your son as a person wanting to experience new and novel things, and who wants to soak up as much as possible of the thing he is interested in, then you can find ways to say yes to that while monitoring the safety with minimal interruption.  \n\nWhen someone interrupts me while doing something I really want to do, and the interruption is something I will have to do anyway (say, let the dog out)I do it right away *so I can get back to what I was doing as fast as possible.*  (Luckily for me there is no one insisting I have to stop and do something else now.) Kids should have the same consideration as I would expect as an adult.  Their experience that they will be able to continue after the brief interruption is a very useful mindset as they get older. My kids and grandkids were raised this way and I never hear any complaints when my son asks my grands to unload the dishwasher before dinner. (Teens, now.) They just learned to get it done so they could get back to it. \n\nYou're NTA, but trying to see through our kid's eyes will help you avoid this kind of scenario.

And you should apologize for making him cry if you haven't already.", "Because, since I'm not a total idiot, if my kid got ahold of sharp scissors, I would simply take them away--not keep handing them back and demanding she pass them to me nicely. You give a five year old enough chances, he or she WILL get in trouble or hurt themselves. A parent is supposed to be smarter than that.", "yeah IDK why dad was concerned about his own safety here that he kept giving scissors -back- to a misbehaving child?", "Couldn't have said it better myself. \n\nOP could have avoided the whole thing if he parented his kiddo. \n\nI have a 4yr old that has gotten ahold of my fabric scissors. It was of course my fault that she had access to them in the first place, but as soon as I saw her with them I gently took them away. \n\nScissors are dangerous and if your kiddo isn't using them the way they're intended to be used, then remove them from the entire situation.\n\n\nETA judgement and typo: YTA OP.", "yeah IDK why dad was concerned about his own safety here that he kept giving scissors -back- to a misbehaving child?", "My kids are grown.  We have two dogs.  They come when I tell them, sit when I tell them etc.  They do not do these things for my husband.  I\u2019m not saying training a kid is like training a dog but the kid (or dog) will listen when dealt with correctly.  OP could have just took the scissors away.  Why did a 5 year old have scissors without supervision in the first place! YTA.", "My toddler son was about to run out in front of a vehicle that was going almost 40 mph. I screamed \"KIDS NAME FUCKING STOP!!!\" \n\nGuess what- he absolutely did stop. He turned around, looked at me and crumbled into a heap on the ground, and burst into tears. \n\nMy IMMEDIATE next action was to get on the ground with him, and to tell him how much he'd scared me- because he almost got VERY very badly hurt and i would be SO upset if he got hurt and to APOLOGIZE for scaring him. \n\nYes I screamed and cursed at my toddler. Yes, I scared him..I damn sure meant to! \n\nWhen the danger is real- sometimes gentle parenting goes out the fucking window. \n\nIf I can make a parenting suggestion- teach your kids, starting when they are VERY young- a code word. Explain that if you use that word or phrase, they are to SILENTLY and IMMEDIATELY listen to you- no matter what - no questions- no complaints- and reiterate that you will only use this in VERY VERY serious situations. \n\n\nEdit since this is getting views; \nI have had the unending fear of a person coming into a store or business when I'm out shopping with my kids, and i can only imagine telling my child \"come here, hurry- and having them continue to whine about a toy or turn back to pay attention to the demo video games- while i see IMMINENT DANGER and my kids'not listening because they don't understand how serious it is. \n\nMy kids and i have a phrase- and even my two year old now knows it. I hope to hell i never have to use it, but we practice in the car \"mouth closed, eyes open- follow directions from the adult NOW\"- i suggest everyone do this. \n\nThis doesn't mean you scream and curse at your child AFTER the danger has passed though.", "I can\u2019t even imagine what you could spend 10 whole minutes telling a 5 year old about scissor safety. At that point it really seems like the \u201csafety conversation\u201d is being used as a punishment, rather than an actual attempt to convey information in a way that the child will understand. Lectures like this are more often an outlet for the lecturer to assert control and express anger/frustration than an opportunity for learning. \n\nSimilar to making a 5 year old (who is clearly amped up and having a hard time settling down) keep picking up scissors you believe he can\u2019t handle safely because it\u2019s more important to make him do something the exact way you want him to than to put away the scissors that are so dangerous you actually believe your own safety is in danger while he holds them.", "It was the \"and move on\" part that they were addressing.", "I\u2019m not sure these are terrible parents. They didn\u2019t do everything right, but there is no evidence that this is a common event either.", "My kid got into this really stubborn phase of ripping his hand out of mine and running in parking lots. I would catch him, etc etc. Then one day a really big old pickup truck was parked in the front of the store with the engine running. The driver saw my son rip and run and as soon as he got in the front of the truck (we weren\u2019t far) he revved the engine reallllly loudly. My son jumped 10 feet in the air, ran back to me and never did it again. The driver winked at me and the boy never did it again.", "How dare you try to discipline MY little angel?!?"]}
