I cut my own bangs but they're my bangs and I spent many hours watching YouTube videos and many years perfecting my technique. I would never offer to do that for anyone else because I would feel horrible if I messed up. What bothers me is your wife's name calling and surly behavior. I get that she was probably upset/embarrassed that she messed up your kid's hair but the nonchalant way she just says the haircut isn't \"really that bad\" suggests she doesn't care that your child is going to get bullied.

A 13 yo can cut her own bangs.\n\nThe answer is usually DRY hair, not pulled taut and vertical scissors making tiny snips to un-blunt the ends. But Becca should have 4 days at least of growth before she goes back to school, so she can see what needs to be done. Bangs are hard and everyone has a horror story... what was your wife thinking without hours of youtube research! It's why youtube exists!\n\nBTW: I do cut my own hair (have done at least two cuts per year) and my husband's (since pandemic). That mess can be tricky, and you have to own when you screw up not double down (like forget the guard on the razor - yep did that!). Mom is not cool for being so defensive. Take that L and move on.", ">Until yesterday, Becca had curtain bangs that went down to *under* her eyes.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, what? Get your kid a haircut. If you don\u2019t like how your wife cut the kid\u2019s hair (and, to be clear, your kid\u2019s preference is the only one that matters), then you take her to a salon.\n\nYTA for doing nothing and complaining when someone actually tried to address the issue.", "NTA", "NTA. If your daughter is upset, enough said. She should have gone to the salon. There\u2019s a reason beauticians are licensed and there\u2019s entire schools to teach them this stuff. It\u2019s not just going in with scissors. There\u2019s like a science to doing hair. My mom would only ever do trims to my hair and anything else she\u2019d take me to the salon. My mom wouldn\u2019t even attempt when I asked for bangs. See if there are hair styles that can accommodate the cut until it grows out. Your wife is wrong and you\u2019re NTA. Tell your daughter she\u2019s beautiful and maybe take her out to lunch or something, hair will grow back eventually :)", "NTA most salons do bang trims for free for existing clients. As someone who grew up with a mom who \"just did\" my hair for me too, I'm so sorry. Mom needs to learn that hair is important. I bet she would be in tears if her bangs looked the exact same as Becca's", "NTA\n\nWhat matters here is Becca's opinions on how bad it is, not her mom's. Especially at her age.\n\nI got a bad haircut when I was about that age, I survived. The difference is to this day I know it's because it's what I wanted (I just looked nothing like what I was copying it from).\n\nI also had a friend who mom would butcher her bangs (they couldn't afford a salon except at the beginning of the school year), and she started to do them herself, where she could at least shrug it off if she messed up because it was her own choice and it would grow back.\n\nIt tends to be easier to forgive ourselves than our parents, especially during teen years. Maybe this is the angle to take with your wife, and I hope she hears it.\n\n(Edited to add - the first haircut I gave my first child was such a disaster I cried for like a week, and he was too young to even notice. We all make mistakes.)", "Ahh omg team mom with zero hairdressing talent unite. I can laugh now at my literally (unintentionally) asymmetrical short bangs, but at 13 it feels bad for sure.

Even the salon couldn\u2019t fix the Dumb and Dumber Special your wife inflicted on a 13-year-old. \n\nGive your daughter the gift of body autonomy - to be able to say \u201cno\u201d without retaliation.  If she didn\u2019t want your wife to touch her hair, her hair shouldn\u2019t have been touched: no forcing, yelling, manipulating, etc.  This is a good lesson for your daughter regarding parents - and other people, like boys, coaches, religious leaders, teachers.  She should be able to say \u2018no, don\u2019t touch me\u2019, even to her parents and be safe.  \n\nAs for your wife, if she truly believes it doesn\u2019t \u2018look that bad\u2019, she will cut her own bangs *exactly* the same way in solidarity.

They often grow quickly and need a trim every couple of weeks. Many don't go to the salon that often. That said, you have to know how to do it.

Both her sister and her father had been hairdressers, so I suppose my mother thought that she had learned those skills by osmosis. First one side was too short then the other side was too short - and we went back-and-forth multiple times before my mother finally admitted to herself that she did not have the skills she thought she had. By the time we went to a salon to get it fixed, I ended up with hair far far shorter than what would be a pixie cut. This at a time when very very few girls had short hair. My only saving grace was that the school year had just ended so at least I had a couple of months for some regrowth of hair before I had to present myself at school.
