They will refer to me and Snow as each other\u2019s cousins even though we technically aren\u2019t related. Snow and I don\u2019t interact at all at school, since we\u2019re in different grades, but we have to be around each other fairly often because of our parents.\n\nSnow\u2019s parents are super nice people. They volunteer at Habitat for Humanity in their free time and treat all their kids equally. But Snow herself is not a good person; She lies and sabotages others to make herself seem like a hero.\n\nFor example, she made fake texts to convince her friend \u201cHana\u2019s\u201d boyfriend that Hana had been cheating on him. (I know because Snow \u201cborrowed\u201d my IPad to do it.) After he broke up with Hana, Snow comforted Hana and pretended like she had no idea who gave him/made the fake texts.\n\nAnother time, she lied to her friend \u201cAva\u201d that their other friend \u201cJen\u201d was planning to delete Ava\u2019s art folder where she saved all her animations. When Ava and Jen got into a fight over it, Snow turned on Ava, called her a liar, and then convinced her other friends to kick Ava out of their friend group.\n\nSnow has been doing things like this since middle school and she is now a senior at our high school. By now, people have realized that Snow was the one actually causing all the drama and issues and now avoid her. Nobody is mean to her, they just avoid her. They\u2019ll work with her for school projects if they\u2019re paired together, but they only speak to Snow for project reasons.\n\nHer parents have talked to the school, but the school can\u2019t do anything because like I said, nobody is being mean to Snow and other students will work with her for project reasons. They can\u2019t force people to be Snow's friends.\n\nSnow was complaining about how unfair her life is and blamed former friends like Hana and Ava. I was tired of it, so I told Snow that people aren\u2019t bullying her, they just recognize what kind of person she is and do not want to be associated with her. She\u2019s acted like a bad person for years so stop playing the victim now that others don\u2019t trust you.\n\nOur school also has a Friendship Club where she can play board games with people and doesn\u2019t have to be alone during lunch. Snow will have to put in the hard work to gain people\u2019s trust back, and she must accept that some people will never be able to trust her again.\n\nSnow hasn\u2019t told her parents about what I said. And I have never told Snow\u2019s parents about her own behavior. My parents told me not to bring it up to her parents because they don\u2019t want it to hurt the friendship.\n\nThe people who I have told are divided. Some are saying it was a needed reality check. But others are saying that mass shunning is a form of bullying and that nobody deserves that. And what I said to Snow was victim-blaming.
