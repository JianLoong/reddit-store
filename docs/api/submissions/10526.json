Shunning someone for reasons out of their control (disabilities, looks, social status, etc.), while maybe not bullying behavior, can be cruel and make the person feel isolated and lonely. However, this isn't for no reason. Snow did a lot of bad things to people who were supposed to be her friends. They found out and want nothing to do with her, understandably.\n\nYou didn't mention it, so I'm assuming she never apologized to them and hasn't changed her ways and would be likely to stir up drama again if given the chance.", "If you are an asshole to other people, don't expect them to like you or want to be around you. \n\nTime she learns that, she might still be forced to be around people her age since they all go to school together. But once she leaves high school everyone will go their own way, and the people that stick with you are the people that want to stick with you.", "NTA - it isn\u2019t mass shunning unless there is coordination and concerted effort to ostracize. It sounds a lot more like everyone is realizing on their own that Snow is hazardous to befriend, and are individually avoiding her for their own self-preservation.\n\nAs for Snow herself, she has worked hard to earn the reputation that is causing people to steer clear.  She cannot expect to abuse people and have them cheerfully sign up for another round.", "NTA. You should have told her parents years ago so they could try to correct her behavior.", "It doesn\u2019t really sound like she is being bullied, more like being forced to,live with the consequences of her actions. \n\nThat\u2019s a life lesson she apparently needed very badly, and still wasn\u2019t recognizing.\n\nNTA. You simply told her the truth.", "Nta", "NTA - People who want to be perceived as a hero have strong needs for attention.  It would be interesting to know why she needs attention.   From what you said she has some need for drama and at the base of such a person is someone very insecure.   So from what I see you did her a needed reality check and now the ball is in her court to do the needful activities to prove to others she can be trusted.  There is no bullying here--she's experiencing the consequences of her bad behavior.    Not everyone is redeemable until they choose to see what their behavior has done.", "She is the bully and everyone realized it. She\u2019s not the victim here at all.", "It really depends on the context. Lots of behavior are or aren\u2019t forms of bullying depending on the situation. \n\nI work in a school and have to explain the difference between bullying and the natural consequences of a child\u2019s actions frequently. Yes, someone frequently pushing their desk into your child is bad. But your child is leaning their chair back into the desk, pushing it into the classmate behind them, and refusing to move when asked. That second part, means the desk pushing is not a form of bullying. Bullying is systematic, typically unprovoked and aimed at someone who is perceived to be vulnerable. That is not what is happening here. So OP\u2019s cousins is being shunned, but it\u2019s a direct result of their bad behavior. So it\u2019s not bullying.", "I mean, it\u2019s not \u201cmodern bullying\u201d it\u2019s one of the oldest forms of maintaining social order. You treat people like shit, you\u2019re out of the community and then a mountain lion eats your rude ass. Nature, perfected.", "I didn't offer judgement, I simply offered an explanation as to how mass shunning/ostracism can be seen as bullying.  I even specifically said \"justified or not\" which should have been clear that context (like with everything) matters.", "It's modern in the sense that it's a less overt form of bullying/harassment in a time when harassment policies, with defined qualifying actions, exist.  It's modern in the sense that recent studies have suggested increases in instances of ostracism vs the past because it's less direct and easier to get away with in environments where bullying/harassment is typically frowned upon.", "Not necessarily -- lots of times, when there's mass shunning the only reason is that the victim is different and perceived as vulnerable. But in this particular case, the 'victim' clearly did do something to deserve it.", "I think the \u201cjustified or not\u201d is what caused the confusion. That phrasing implies that either way mass shunning is a form of bullying. Which is inaccurate.", "In a thread about bullying, you've been told your actions are unwelcome and asked to stop and did not?  You really need a better understanding of harassment, you have no place here attempting to inform others while at the same time actually harassing someone.  Uncool.", "It's not harassment to respond to someone on a forum, man.", "I'm sorry, but you have no right to decide unilaterally that a public response to a public debate is unwelcome. \n\nIf you wish to decide that it's unwelcome *to you*, the way you do that legitimately is to leave the discussion and go home yourself. It is neither ethical nor effective to demand that other people stop discussing the topic. And it's certainly not bullying or harassment to refuse to yield to your unreasonable demands."]}
