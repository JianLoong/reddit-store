The dude probs just thought it was a goofy sign meant to make people laugh.", "Lol a guard snake. Hilarious. Its funnier when you know what Ball Pythons are like. They have that name because they curl into a ball and hide their heads when scared. This snake wouldnt be \"guarding\" anything lol. Funny concept though. To most people,all snakes are like King Cobras or like straight out of Snakes on a Plane or Anaconda or Harry Potter.", "right? and then i would have walked out the front door if denied access to play with the snake.", "ooooh i have a russian tortoise who is my heart. my husband, who never liked reptiles of any kind and couldn't really understand why i did, nevertheless surprised me with one for my birthday nearly 20 years ago. he loved cats/dogs etc but thought reptiles couldn't development an attachment to humans. guess who ended up becoming totally enamored with the tortoise, and would talk babytalk to him? hahaha", "I would like to see the snake too \ud83d\udc0d", "OP is NTA but would be TA if she doesn\u2019t pay the snek tax", "Mocking immutable characteristics of other people isn\u2019t a good look", "I love it when people think a 4 ft long python can eat a person.", "NTA but if I read that sign on the door I would have assumed it was a joke.", "NTA.\n\nWe need pet taxes.\n\nAnnnddd can I be your friend? I want to visit the creatures.", "Snek tax! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d", "YTA 100% \n\nWhat the actual fuck \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, creeps gonna creep", "Why are men the biggest babies about snakes?  My husband is scared to death of them, I still make fun of him for screaming like a girl and half running away the time my step son and his cousin filled a 5 gallon bucket 1/4 - 1/3 full of garden snakes on the family farm and then showed them to him all proud of themselves ( the snakes were released soon after in the large garden and around the barns & sheds). \n\nA couple years later, same stepson asked dad if he could get a pet snake. Dad didn\u2019t want to be the mean parent, so he told him to ask his stepmom (me). I wouldn\u2019t call them cute, but I kinda like them and wouldn\u2019t mind having one at all - would even have taken care of it when he spent time at his mom\u2019s house.   \nSo he asks me, I ask him if he\u2019s willing to learn how to take care of it, he is so we both go to tell hubby/dad that I thought it was a great idea. I don\u2019t remember how he got himself out of it, but he rarely tried to get me to be the mean one again.", "NTA.\n\nDoes he know people have pet sneks?? Me.. I want one \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso a octopus as a pet!?? So cool!!!", "NTA\n\n>He said he was looking for my bedroom because he assumed I'd meet him up there?\n\nWhat in all that is holy?  \nNever in my 29 years on this planet have I ever had a date or male guest let themselves into my bedroom with the expectation that I would follow them.  \nWas there no lead up to that at all? I could understand more if you'd told us that in the preceding minutes you'd been practically riding him in your living room and taking things to the bedroom seemed like the best next step. But if this didn't happen, his assumption is completely bizarre. \n\nAs for the reaction to your snake, lmfao.  \nSo this man, without consent, started wading through your home and found something that you likely didn't intend him to find. He's acting like you're letting your snake roam the entire house and therefore he had 'rights' to know about that.  \nBut that isn't what happened, you had no intention of putting him face to face with your snake, he has done this to himself by wandering where he did not have permission to wander. He sounds like the kind of idiot who'd break into a lion enclosure as he 'doesn't know' what the fence is for, therefore breaking into it is fair game.", "I have an empty room leftover aswell. Really considering making it into a full room terrarium now...", "NTA. He should not have been opening doors in your house. Period. That has been established. \n\nHowever! \nI would certainly want to know if I was going into a house with a large snake even potentially on the loose. They give me the heebie jeebies and I wouldn\u2019t even want to be under the same roof as one. \nIt also would generally be courteous to advise people if you have pets in general in case they have allergies? I realize this maybe isn\u2019t the first thing one thinks of when engaging in a hook up (I wouldn\u2019t know, never did that).\nJust another perspective. \n\nAgain, dude was an AH for opening the door and snooping and then for his reaction. No dispute there.", "NTA. \n\nI would put a more explicit sign on the door, since weirdos can\u2019t be trusted not to snoop through your rooms.", "NTA, that's an awesome sign lol", "Nta but man this guy is. Thankfully this dude isn't a bf or anything with emotions involved, he was some free dick and do I have some good news for you girl, dick is plentiful. Finding mediocre dick or even good dick is easy. So lose this loser and find yourself a dick with a better guy attached to it, this one isn't worth keeping.", "NTA and every snake's dream owner.", "NTA\n\n... though... if someone had a tarantula room I would want to know...", "NTA. That said either replace the knob with an outdoor one you can key lock or put a second sign up saying there is indeed a loose snake that is your pet in the room. I get that people shouldn't just snoop in your house but it's going to Gastown and it's a tad irresponsible toward your pet to not protect it slightly better then this. A loose snake is not normal, I highly recommend the door knob replacement. That said good for you that snake surely loves their habitat.", "Who cares about that idiot? Tell us more about your snake! \n\nIt sounds super adorable that you gave her a whole room hahahaha.  Can we see her? What's her name? \n\nOh, and NTA", "NTA you dodged a bullet", "NTA but i hope u know the pet tax also applies to snakes!  I'd love to see the snek room", "My grandma used to say \"peek not through the keyhole lest yet be vexed\". Judging by this post, she was spot on!!  NTA, he should know better.", "The 'no step on snek' sign is a snarky dig at alt-right folks and their use of the [Gadsden flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Gadsden_flag.svg).  Given the context, it really doesn't serve as a warning about the actual snake.  I'd just assume someone with that flag has a somewhat juvenile sense of humor (no judgement, you do you).", "They love that kinda stuff. Its a common myth that Ball Pythons never climb,however this has been found to be not true. Males in the wild have beem found to eat a lot of birds and climb trees. If given the opportunity, captive ones like climbing. You can even put a \"sky hide\" in their enclosure which is a hide box secured to the top of the enclosure, from what Ive seen,the snakes seem to like them. Probs because they can feel secure while watching whats going on around them.", "It's not like OP left the snake to roam wherever in the entire house. One room is set for that. What was he doing snooping? \nBut I agree, a head's up would be nice, but my reasoning is that you should tell about any pet or such thing due to any type of allergy. Like people have allergy from dogs or cats, maybe someone has an allergy from a snake?\ud83e\udd14 \ud83d\udc0d\n But it doesn't make OP an AH", "Not sure I would call OP the AH, but I definitely agree with giving the heads up next time. There are a lot of people who get the heebie-jeebies from snakes. Even in a different room.", "Its a pretty silly meme,obviously making fun of the \"dont tread on me\" flag. If you think thats immature,a lot of people refer to snakes as \"danger noodles\" or noodles. I mean its very hard to take an animal thats basically a living noodle 100% seriously.", "Whyy?", "NTA. It's your house. Why is he poking around? \n\nAlong with Snek tax, we also need Octopus tax. And for you to me my new best friend so I can come hang out with your critters.", "Cis dudes just have no sense of humor, like there are so many jokes here.", "Ahh. I didn't know that. Thank you.", "Yeah, OP is NTA for sure and her hookup had no right to be opening doors he wasn\u2019t invited into.\n\nBut it would never occur to me that that cute sign means there is an actual snake completely loose in the room. She might want a more clear sign in case of some future house cleaner/plumber/police officer who has an actual reason to open the door. Or even just to protect her snake from getting stepped on by the next jabroni hookup who sneaks around uninvited.", "Please show us a picture of the snake", "Because she has a SNAKE in her house and she did not tell her guest. I would never walk into a house with a snake. \n\nAnd if I found out afterwards, I\u2019d have the same reaction as the dude did.", "Username checks out", "So well put. Cheers.", "Oh good. \n\nWas a genuine question. Skipped that one.", "He had that reaction because he went into the room. Why was he doing that in the first place?"]}
