She's very lazy and chill, and mostly just lays around under the heat lamps in her tank. \n\nBut when I bought the house, I decided to let her have the run of a room, since I had extra space. I sealed up the windows, door, vents, light fixtures, pretty much any crack she could try to squeeze through, and leave the top off her tank so she can roam around. I got some big pieces of driftwood and screwed them together to make basically a big cat tree for snakes, she loves climbing it and hanging out by the window. \n\n Though a lot of the time she still lays in the tank since she likes the heat lamp.
