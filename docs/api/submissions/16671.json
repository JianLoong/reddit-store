I do not even own a snake, yet, because though I know I'll do a great job of making sure it's secure, my grandma will not come into my house if there's a snake living in it. When I get a snake eventually, I'll tell people I have a pet snake, it's in this bedroom, and it's totally secure just so they are aware. That's what I'd recommend for the future, because even though you know your snake is chill and secure, other people deserve to make an informed decision about spending time in a house with a snake. It's also a much better way to make sure your pet is safe! My friend's brother decided showing my pet tarantula to their kid was a good idea and he got knocked to the ground- I'm very grateful he didn't get injured. It's just better to not surprise people with pets because the pet is almost always the one in more danger. \n\nThat being said, NTA- you dodged a bullet with this guy, who was going through your house without your permission, obviously on purpose, and then tried to throw it back in your face when he was embarrassed about getting startled by a snake.

She is contained and won't get you or anything, and if you want to see her, I'm happy to show you, but please don't go into her room without me.\"", "NTA.\n\nExcept for not showing the snake friend and his lovely home", "You're not an asshole and he shouldn't have gone into rooms on his own but at the same time you should realize that it's a possibility that someone new to the apt should be informed\n\nAlso that flag is a joke/meme version of the Gadsden flag... it's political. If I saw that sign I'd just assume you were one of *those* people, I definitely wouldn't think it was a warning about an actual giant python lmao", "NTA. I have a snake room. I'd be pissed if somebody reacted like that. Mine has a beware sign with a snake on it.", "NTA - sounds like you dodged a bullet and owe your scaly lady a thank you! Him assuming so much, overstepping your boundaries by looking for your bedroom, and his anger were not promising signs. \n\nY T A for not having any pictures of your snake room and your snake looking out the window though!!!! You\u2019re living me and my partner\u2019s dream!!", "NTA.  Who is he to judge you for your pet preferences?  Maybe you should have warned him, but that's not an excuse for him going into a room without permission.  When I was single I'd ask anyone I went home with (It DIDN'T happen often) if they had any pets I needed to be aware of after one had a psychotic Chihuahua that attacked me.  (It got ahold of my jeans leg, luckily.  No blood flew.)  But it's a habit I kept until I got married.  Again, NTA.", "No he got what he deserved for being a snoop. This is hilarious honestly and maybe everyone should have a snake room.", "NTA\nAs someone that also has a snake room (my husband breeds ball pythons), we don't warn evey person that enters our home that there's snakes in that room, we occasionally have to yell at our little nieces and nephews not to open that door but they are little so obviously they are noisy lol.\n\nDefinitely think it was weird he was just opening random doors in your home without permission, agree with those people that said he was probably looking for stuff to steal.", "He is the crazy one for snooping around. I'm glad he got freaked out, hopefully it'll teach him a lesson. \n\nOP, NTA.", "*But he was basically berating me for having a snake and not telling him.*\n\nWas his name Indiana Jones?", "NTA. Instead of pooping he went snooping. That's on him.", "Oh I get it. He thought it was a men's room and you're warning him not to step on his giant schlong. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. and Id love to find a secret snake room at a hookups house!!!!", "Nope, NTA.", "NTA, first off, if it were me, I\u2019d have chuckled at the sign and taken a piss in the bathroom, if somehow I magicked my way into said Snake Room I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in, my response would likely be \u201cOh sweet! So THAT\u2019s what the sign means, she\u2019s got a snake friend! She\u2019s so cool, we should hang out more.\u201d\n\nMan, that guy is pathetic. How is that your reaction, you sound cool as fuck lol.", "Agreed, totally got what he deserved. \nAnd OP, obviously it's your house and you do whatever you want, but I would suggest considering locking doors you don't want guests to open while they're in your home. They shouldn't be going in random rooms regardless, but obviously not everyone has the common sense and courtesy not to snoop. And tbh, he sounds like a nightmare. Good luck with your future hookups though, hopefully they aren't scared of a spaghetti noodle with eyes \ud83d\ude02", "Snake tax! Snake tax! Snake tax! \ud83d\udc0d", "But why would you be opening a closed door in the house of someone you met a few hours ago?", "Snakes are not all that uncommon as pets. Yes, they're a lot less common than cats or dogs but especially recently, they've been gaining in popularity. But for at least 40 years, you could go in to pet stores and see snakes being sold as pets. It's not unheard of at all. It's hardly shocking to find out someone has a pet snake.\n\nIf someone having a snake would horrify you, A) dont fucking open random doors in their house and B) ask if they have pets before you go over. Chances are they will tell you, \"yep. I have snake\" and you can avoid being traumatized by seeing someone's pet.", "After saying it's a bag of dead rats, you need to tell your housemates not to eat them?!?\n\nAnd I thought they wanted live food. (The python, not the housemates)", "I was thinking pantry thief \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Your issue is not my issue. It is a distasteful joke but a joke all the same. You are making an assumption that is not  my real world point of view. In all reality I would never belittle a man with smaller parts. He obviously cannot help it. We know nothing of the man OP is talking about. A joke got started in a thread. That is all. Our comments cannot possibly represent a man we know nothing about.", "Do you think he actually looked at the snake longer than 1.5 seconds before he fled?  He probably remembers that it\u2019s at least 10 feet long, with glowing red eyes.", "Aha then he 100% deserved to be terrified. Fuck that guy", "Or a picture of the pet with the addition \"Mike's room\"", "The little ones are my favorite. I have 3 hognoses!", "You just need better hookup material. NTA.", "Being someone who\u2019s not an avid snake lover. Maybe a quick oh btw I have a pet snake yet they can\u2019t get out. Let him choose what he wants to do. \nBut defiantly NTA. He shouldn\u2019t of gone snooping in my eyes.", "Nta. That\u2019s what he gets for being somewhere he doesn\u2019t belong.", "NTA. You sound amazing though, that snake has a rocking owner.", "Definitely NTA!! But it is funny AF!\n\nServes him right for trying to snoop! And not being aware enough to notice/read the sign!", "Did he not get the memo? He was there for sex, not a house tour. He had ONE JOB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, of course, and your pets must be so happy.", "I have scrolled and scrolled and still no photos of snake \ud83d\ude14", "NTA. Give that snake an extra mouse or snake treat or whatever they eat. She did you a favor by scaring off that snoopy asshole.", "I need to see photos of the danger noodle", "You are only T A if you don't pay the nope rope tax.  And ideally the grabby water balloon tax, too. While you're at it, we should probably also receive the pet dragon tax.\n\nBut for real, NTA.", "NTA but I want to know more about the octopus.", "NTA. I mean sure you could have given him a head's up, but you aren't an AH for not doing so. The fact that he decided to go poking where he shouldn't have been poking, it kind of makes me think the guy wanted to scope the place out, for \"reasons.\"", "ESH. He shouldn't have been opening doors. But you should have a sign that is more clearly \"live snake! Don't open this door!!!\" Your sign is cute but doesn't really function as a proper warning.", "Please picture of your octopus. Nta", "Incredibly clear-cut NTA, but OP, darling, hooking up with a guy at a bar is perhaps the most socially and statistically normal, unjudgeable part of this post. You lead with a snake room and a surprise octopus appearance, one human man simply cannot effectively compete for the attention given while reading the post. Some dude? Sure, uh-huh, fine, whatever. But the Creature Room??? \n\nYou say the lid on the octopus tank is sealed tight to keep the snake out, but does it also ensure the octopus stays in? *Are you sure*, because they've been known to go where they please regardless of lids? How big an octopus is it? Does it have enough space in the tank? Does it have stuff to play with? Does the snake slither up to the tanks to watch the octopus and the lizards? How many lizards? What kind? Does the snake enjoy the not-cat tree?", "NTA - That guy was a nosey prick. He was definitely the AH.", "NTA.", "NTA!  That is coming from someone from a full on snake phobia!  The only thing I can think of is that maybe he saw the sign and was curious?  If I saw it, one I wouldn\u2019t open for fear that there was actually one behind the door, but looking at it it does look like a joke sign and not a real warning label. I\u2019m not giving him an excuse to go into a room he wasn\u2019t suppose to be in by any means, that\u2019s so creepy, I\u2019m just trying to think of what could have possibly gone through his mind to think it was ok. \nGlad your snake wasn\u2019t hurt though!", "NTA, FAFO. That was very rude of him to just start opening doors like that.", "I think that snake saved you a whole hella problems", "NTA; Regardless of what he says, he wasn't looking for your bedroom.  He was snooping.  It also sounds like he has an issue in general with snakes. ie he's scared of them.   Bottom line, you don't owe an explanation to or apology to him.  You didn't give him permission to look in your bedrooms and you didn't tell him you would meet him anywhere other than where he left you.  If he didn't like what he found, then he shouldn't have been snooping.", "This story is absolutely hilarious to me! Love it. You sound like such a wonderful owner, too. Good on you for enriching your snake's life. \n\nAnd NTA, obviously. Snake's room was clearly marked, and the guy was only supposed to go to the bathroom. His fault for being nosey.", "NTA but snake room sounds cool as hell", ">I don't know if you have watched Arrested Development but there is a scene where Jason Bateman's character takes a paper bag out of the fridge and it says 'dead dove: don't eat' and he opens it and it's a dead dove and he goes, 'I don't know what I was expecting.' I feel like people might view the sign like that.\n\n\n\n\nOur hamster just died (3 yrs, 1 month old) and while I hammer out funeral stuff for him I have him in a tea tin in the freezer labeled \"don't open unless you want to see a dead hamster\"\n\nApparently I had forgotten to tell my oldest son hamster had died and that was essentially what he did too lol.", "NTA me and OP are best friends now", "I think going through someone\u2019s things is more of an issue than being afraid of snakes.

Some Ball Pythons won't make the transition from live, but it's not super common.  You do usually have to make the prey \"dance\" a bit, and it has to be warm, around 100 degrees.  My mother was a bit perturbed when she found the bag of frozen rats in my freezer, (it was a clear bag, but I stuffed it in a pillow case before she came to visit.) She liked the snake though and was fascinated to watch me feed it so she got over the idea of dead rats in my freezer.", "Hahah yea! And it was funny because he was genuinely surprised to find the hamster in there... Teen boys lol", "Nope rope!", "See as a safety check I can see just taking a quick quiet peek- make sure you're actually alone when told you will be, nothing overtly questionable that makes you question your safety alone with the person, etc. Doesn't make you an asshole imo just a last call for quietly making an excuse to bail if needed before things get intimate should you find like a Stalker Shrine or some Cult Bullshit or whatever else might throw up red flags for you.", "Not really. My roommate has both a Ball python and a Rainbow Boa. The Boa is about five-six foot range (we haven't measured it, but it's a little longer than he is tall) and the Ball Python is right at five foot (plus or minus an inch).\n\nHis Ball is about standard size. Same for the Boa. And those are considered pretty average breeds compared to other pet snakes.\n\nCorn Snakes and Hognoses are the teeny babies that are \"small\" breeds.", "Average meaning 5-6ft? My corn is in that range too actually, they\u2019re just skinny babies. You don\u2019t see people with larger pet snakes than a ball or rainbow regularly, because they need more space than most people can provide"]}
