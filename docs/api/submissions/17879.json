How long was she planning on tracking it? Indefinitely? Because that's just creepy.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate it became a yelling match. You\u2019re understandably frustrated at your privacy being invaded. Your mom is controlling and shouldn\u2019t be fighting you about this. \n\nAutonomy is important while you\u2019re developing. You\u2019re learning who you are, and what your boundaries are.", "NTA. I have two teenage girls. I track one as she has very irregular periods and I track it for medical reasons. My other daughter has her own tracker and I do ask when it is coming just to make sure there are supplies. It stinks when you have to make a late night run to the store. I guess I wonder why your mom is so insistent. My goal has always been to get my daughters to know when it is coming so they are prepared for school and sports.", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely controlling of her to want to do that. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with that!", "NTA I believe in some states healthcare providers can\u2019t talk about period stuff about you with your mother. Unless you give permission. Also it\u2019s  creepy.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you were frequently irregular because then she might be tracking your cycle for to being up to a doctor, but if everything is pretty normal she should back off. You\u2019re tracking yourself and you\u2019ve been open about when your cycle starts/stops. Your mom is being really overbearing.", "NTA but i don\u2019t think this is screaming match worthy. Does she at least know to provide you with extra care when your time comes around to warrant the tracking? \n\nIs there any way you can leave her in the dark about when you start?\n\nSome parents can be overbearing and learning to navigate that will help immensely.", "INFO did she go through menopause already? Women in the same house tend to have the same cycle. Also if she did how does she know when you're having your period (I never talked about mine *that* consistently with my mother!).", "Just an alternate POV to consider: I had very erratic cycles and other related issues when I was young, so I would have appreciated my mom tracking them for medical reasons back then. Doctors don\u2019t always believe grown women, even less so teen girls. Having documentation from an adult can help you get your symptoms taken more seriously. Since you\u2019re a minor and she\u2019s responsible for your health care she might feel it\u2019s her responsibility to track it to be sure no problems go undiagnosed and untreated, especially if she had her own problems with it and she thinks you could have inherited them.\n\nShe could also want to be the first to know if you become pregnant (if that\u2019s even a concern for you), to ensure you\u2019ll have options should you need them, depending on your beliefs and your state\u2019s laws. \n\nAgain, it would be very weird if you were her adult child, but far less so if you\u2019re still a minor and her dependent. She may have had or known someone who had experience with any of these things. You might try to gently broach the subject with her to see where her true concerns and intentions lie.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At 12-13, tracking or helping you track would be fine, as someone needs to help you learn the process and explain why it\u2019s important.  But at 15-16, it feels icky and creepy, like she wants to make sure you\u2019re not pregnant.  And/or viewing you as being younger and needing more help than what you actually do need.  At best she is benignly (but wrongly) thinking that because you\u2019re under 18, and under her legal guardianship, that she needs to know in order to participate in any medical decision process that might at some point hypothetically need to happen.", "NTA.

That is fucking weird. I don't think my mom EVER tracked mine.", "NTA. Your mom is weird. My mother barely tracked her own period and once joked that women who use the Rhythm Method are called mothers. She only knew that I got my first period because she noticed that I'd left a lot of bled-through panty liners in the trash. At which point, she handed me a box of maxi pads. And that is the last we ever spoke of menstruation.", "I don't track my daughter's period.  She's 16.  I usually do know when she has it, because she may ask me for more supplies, or I might notice she goes to the bathroom more often, but this is just stuff that happens, not that I do on purpose.  She's perfectly capable of handling it on her own.\n\nIt is kind of handy, though, since my own period usually comes a week after hers, so I tell her she is my app or calendar, lol.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for your mother tracking it is if she thinks you might get pregnant.", "As a woman with PCOS and irregular periods, whose mom also tracks hers, NTA.\nI absolutely understand that feeling because mine used to say \"You haven't had your period in a long time\" and it made things worse for me mentally.

No need to buy them *only* when someone's actually on their period.", "Right?! My mum had better things to do with her time. It's not rocket science, if I was running low on pads or tampons I'd take the next opportunity to get some at the store, regardless of whether I was currently on my period or not.

Not trying to be rude, but it's solely your issue to deal with, right? It shouldn't be affecting her other than to buy more supplies??", "i agree.. i also think it is funny because having much younger siblings in addition to having a sister with special needs most times i feel like i act like the adult or the parent in certain situations. i always joke that I'm their second mother. lol", "Do you empty your own trash? Because otherwise, even if she's not checking it she'll still know when she takes out the trash", "I do empty my own trash and she rarely ever even goes in my bathroom cause my room is downstairs and hers is upstairs. She's also been dealing with knee injury/pain for the past few years so stairs are hard for her. plus, I am close enough to my mom and trust her enough that I know she wouldn't be THAT invasive to go out of her way to check especially after she agreed to respect my privacy, even if shes not happy about it.", "NTA intensely exercise and take birth control to throw her off your rhythm /j", "INFO: Do you live in a place with restrictions on female health care? \nI am a mom. Granted, my kid is a lot younger than you and I am a somewhat anxious person. But if I lived in a place with strict restrictions on Healthcare and abortion, I would be scared for my kid and probably keep track of their period. \nDo you think that might be the case? I know you asked her why she does it, but maybe ask her directly if she does it because she's worried about you getting pregnant and not having access to Healthcare. Maybe she is keeping the real reason, her fear and worry, secret in an attempt to shield you from it?\nWe, mums, always worry about you, our kids, and want the best for you and sometimes that clouds our judgment and makes us underestimate you. And it can be hard for us to see that. I get that it is annoying and sometimes degrading. Assuming your mum isn't abusive and you generally have a good relationship, maybe try talking to her again with this in mind?", "NTA. This is weird, just weird. I never ever tracked my daughters' periods. They started around the age of 11, 12 and that is old enough to track it yourself, exception let alone.

[Edit: she may have gotten into the habit due to your sister, but that does not make it ok that she is trying to do the same for you.]\n\nIt's really unhealthy behavior on her part and she is probably still tracking it, and just bringing up how she wishes that you'd \"let her\".
