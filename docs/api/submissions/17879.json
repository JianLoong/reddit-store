I don't know what it is but this gives me creepy vibes. I have 2 teenage girls and if I think they are being negatively affected by their periods I ask if they are on it. I don't need to track it myself. Idk... it's like too big brother for me. Good for you for holding your ground", "Wow, that is weird. I would've stopped tracking my kids after 6 months, maybe even sooner. \n\nThere are things she does that you may be fine with while others wouldn't be. She's your mom give her a little slack. Good job of having the conversation. \n\nNTA", "NTA, bet you\u2019re tracking the number of days until you can move out.", "info: (1): my sister has special needs and doesn't know how to properly track her period so my mom does it for her. so maybe she feels the need to do it with me as well i don\u2019t know? also (2): she has no reason to think I am pregnant or would get pregnant because I literally have one guy friend who is my best friends brother. and (3): I always tell her as soon as I start anyway so I'm confused as to why she wants to track it. its just giving me weird vibes...", "NTA. How long was she planning on tracking it? Indefinitely? Because that's just creepy.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate it became a yelling match. You\u2019re understandably frustrated at your privacy being invaded. Your mom is controlling and shouldn\u2019t be fighting you about this. \n\nAutonomy is important while you\u2019re developing. You\u2019re learning who you are, and what your boundaries are.", "NTA. I have two teenage girls. I track one as she has very irregular periods and I track it for medical reasons. My other daughter has her own tracker and I do ask when it is coming just to make sure there are supplies. It stinks when you have to make a late night run to the store. I guess I wonder why your mom is so insistent. My goal has always been to get my daughters to know when it is coming so they are prepared for school and sports.", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely controlling of her to want to do that. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with that!", "NTA I believe in some states healthcare providers can\u2019t talk about period stuff about you with your mother. Unless you give permission. Also it\u2019s  creepy.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you were frequently irregular because then she might be tracking your cycle for to being up to a doctor, but if everything is pretty normal she should back off. You\u2019re tracking yourself and you\u2019ve been open about when your cycle starts/stops. Your mom is being really overbearing.", "NTA but i don\u2019t think this is screaming match worthy. Does she at least know to provide you with extra care when your time comes around to warrant the tracking? \n\nIs there any way you can leave her in the dark about when you start?\n\nSome parents can be overbearing and learning to navigate that will help immensely.", "INFO did she go through menopause already? Women in the same house tend to have the same cycle. Also if she did how does she know when you're having your period (I never talked about mine *that* consistently with my mother!).", "Just an alternate POV to consider: I had very erratic cycles and other related issues when I was young, so I would have appreciated my mom tracking them for medical reasons back then. Doctors don\u2019t always believe grown women, even less so teen girls. Having documentation from an adult can help you get your symptoms taken more seriously. Since you\u2019re a minor and she\u2019s responsible for your health care she might feel it\u2019s her responsibility to track it to be sure no problems go undiagnosed and untreated, especially if she had her own problems with it and she thinks you could have inherited them.\n\nShe could also want to be the first to know if you become pregnant (if that\u2019s even a concern for you), to ensure you\u2019ll have options should you need them, depending on your beliefs and your state\u2019s laws. \n\nAgain, it would be very weird if you were her adult child, but far less so if you\u2019re still a minor and her dependent. She may have had or known someone who had experience with any of these things. You might try to gently broach the subject with her to see where her true concerns and intentions lie.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At 12-13, tracking or helping you track would be fine, as someone needs to help you learn the process and explain why it\u2019s important.  But at 15-16, it feels icky and creepy, like she wants to make sure you\u2019re not pregnant.  And/or viewing you as being younger and needing more help than what you actually do need.  At best she is benignly (but wrongly) thinking that because you\u2019re under 18, and under her legal guardianship, that she needs to know in order to participate in any medical decision process that might at some point hypothetically need to happen.", "NTA. And what in the name of God is she thinking? What she's doing is an invasion of your privacy, and quite frankly, she's coming across as creepy. \n\nHer reasoning makes no sense at all.", "i dont know i feel like maybe its a paranoia thing  especially because pregnancy is in no way a concern.", "yes. and its confusing i already let her know well beforehand and I tell her when I run out of supplies before it becomes a late night run to the store in most cases. i am also homeschooled and only go to school twice a week without doing any sports or anything. so although i do leave the house, I don't leave the house for necessary activities much.", "Exactly!  This would be the only reason I would track my kid\u2019s bodily functions\u2026\u2026.to properly budget my time and money to have necessary supplies.", "yes i always tell her so i don't know why she feels the need to track it. it feels like she doesn't trust me but there's nothing she could logically be worried about.", "This is actually an urban legend.
