Block all phone numbers and email addresses. Don't answer any calls from unknown numbers. If it is truly important, someone will leave a voice message.\n\nIf harrassment continues, I would get the authorities involved. Keep a journal and mark down dates, times and facts of any encounters so you can keep memories of events straight. Seek out restraining orders or injunctions. Post no trespassing and no solicitor signs on your property. Get a ring doorbell and don't answer the door any more.\n\nOnce things calm down and you and your sibling are stable and safe again, you can decide how you want to move forward with family.
