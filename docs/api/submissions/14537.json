Your parents, by the sound of it, have only ever provided those things conditionally.  They are now cultivating a hostile environment for your younger sibling, who is an adult and who has asked for safe harbour with you. Your parents no longer have the right to demand their youngest child live with them.\n\nIn some cultures, identity is collective. This can have many benefits, but if carried to extremes (i.e. any characteristics that don't fit the collective identity are automatically evil) often results in hardship and ostracisation for those who don't fit in. This has happened to you to an extent, and you can see your sibling suffering even more from it.\n\nYour parents are choosing the collective identity over you and your sibling as individuals. To me that goes against all the things family is supposed to stand for - love, security, support, care.\n\nThe only reason to stay in touch with all these people who are trying to push you to accept your parents' abuse and even apologise for standing up for yourself & your sibling, is if you value the collective identity above everything else too. They have been manipulative (e.g. focusing on your cussing at your parents this one time and ignoring your parents' repeated harassment, interference, and verbal abuse) because you have not capitulated. Their behaviour is escalating because you threaten their view of the world, daring to oppose the established order of the collective identity - that there is only one way to live and all other ways must be shunned.\n\nThe question is not, are you an AH for swearing at your parents, but is there any point trying to salvage a relationship with people who fundamentally do not support you or your sibling? Or are you two better off establishing your own family with people whose values align more closely with yours than your blood relatives?", "your parents are bigots. \n\nmaybe the language was uncalled for, but i think the biggest problem is that the language has skewed the narrative. \n\nyou have a story of your parents being manipulative your whole life, and now that your sibling came out, they verbally abused them and then you with offensive rhetoric, so you lost your temper and cussed them out. \n\nyour parents have told a story of your Sister falling in with the wrong crowd, getting all confused about thinking She's gay, and you are encouraging it because you're entitled and think you were treated unfairly after *ALLLLL THEY'VE DONE FOR YOU*\n\ni think you are a good egg for not only supporting but *standing up for* your sibling, and i empathize that you were scapegoated growing up. i know this is a very real phenomenon. i have witnessed it personally. \n\nthe manipulated, sad extended family is a bramble that you did not cause. \n\ni don't have easy answers for how you can untangle it, but going NC with your parents is probably step one. therapy is step two. good luck. \n\nnta.", "NTA\n\nA culture that allows parents to mistreat their children and expects total submission in the face of them is a culture that both tolerates and condones parental abuse. Your parents have harassed you, insulted you, accused you of heinous things for the crime of sheltering your sibling who is, /checks... eighteen years old and legally allowed to say, \"goodbye forever mom and dad.\" The very least they, or any parent in this situation, should be expecting is for you to cuss them out.\n\nTo put it differently, why are **you**, the person who is legit half their parents age, expected to be more civil and mature by compare to the two 50 year old assholes on your doorstep who refuse to leave?

You're standing up for your sibling and saying what needs to be said to your parents so they don't have to. The times when my siblings stood up to our parents about my pronouns felt so affirming.

Send everyone copies of all the texts, how they are harassing you at work and home, and you finally hit your last straw. Point out how you tried civil, but your parents weren't interested in that so you had to do something to get it through their heads that what they were doing was wrong.

They sound toxic af. Religion aside, it's hate the sin. Not the sinner. Jesus, well I'm assuming church they are Christians, dude hung around whores, and lepers.
