Almost everyone I know seems to believe I've gone overboard and should apologize, but I feel hesitant considering their behaviour.

However, more recently they came out as NB and wanted to change their name and go by different pronouns, and wanted to ask the school and teacher to follow suit. Mind you, we moved from a other country and got held back in school, so even though my sibling is still in secondary they're already 18, and an adult. She can legally ask for these things, but our parents are still informed or asked about academic matters.\n\nSo my parents found out and lost their minds. They've accused my sibling of being sick and insane, if being a pervert and a thousand other things that are too painful to write. I had promised I would be supportive so when they asked to move in with me I obliged.\n\nEver since then my parents have been bombarding me via text, phone, email and even showing up at school, at my house and my job to harass us.\n\nI've asked my parents a thousand times to leave us alone but they won't budge. Last night they showed up at my house unannounced and my mother said they were here to pick up my sibling and \"take her away from my corrupting influence\".

Things like birthdays, picking up my sibling from school, driving them places, etc."]}
