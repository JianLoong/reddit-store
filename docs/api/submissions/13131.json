How arrogant of her to feel entitled to all your attention and affection when you feel sick and clearly need some space. Also, having a period SUCKS, but so does being sick; she doesn\u2019t need to turn it into a competition.

Periods do not cause  103 degree fevers. I\u2019ve been menstruating since 1994 and haven\u2019t spiked a high fever once. No one I know has either. Your girlfriend is ridiculous NTA", "NTA, you sound like you're very sick and I second the suggestion to go to urgent care.", "NTA\n\nAs a woman, when I get sick I want to go to bed and be left alone until I recover...  I'm fine with being fed and watered but any more interaction than that is getting in the way of my recovery.\n\nSounds like she's projecting as only the truly self centred would demand the attention of someone sick then turn spiteful when they don't get it.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s making you sleep on the couch and not giving up the bedroom for you. She\u2019s sounds so selfish. I\u2019d really reconsider this relationship.", "NTA. I\u2019m a woman. I had uterus issues so my periods were extra rough. (My parts had so many issues they had to be taken out. It was bad.) So I am fully aware of how much periods suck. That is not the same as being sick, throwing up, and having a 103 fever. That is apples and oranges. I hate being sick. I can\u2019t even grasp why she\u2019s whining about you not being affectionate. Does she want to get sick? (I love my spouse, but I\u2019ve considered spraying him with Lysol when he\u2019s sick. I don\u2019t want the germs, js.)", "NTA, but I\u2019d recommend a trip to urgent care or something! Feel better!", "NTA women deal with periods all the time yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can invalidate how you\u2019re feeling and most people don\u2019t like affection when they\u2019re not feeling good, especially when it\u2019s stomach ache stuff", "NTA. Periods suck. I hate them. But this is not related? How old is your girlfriend? How old are you? This is a level of immaturity and neediness I\u2019m not sure I could handle.

I'm a woman who has periods and while yes, one can be really ill from them, she doesn't have monopoly on being sick and periods are not the only sickness out there.  \nIs there anyone else you can stay with, like a parent?

It has absolutely nothing to do with anything if my husband, or my child, is sick. I can be in pain, and so can they! I may not be able to help as much as I\u2019d like sometimes, but if I can make my husband a hot tea, grab him medicine, and baby him for a bit before I have to go sit back down, I absolutely will. We love each other, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. \n\nThat girl sounds\u2026high maintenance.

I reckon there's a half chance she might currently have the painters in, but under no circumstances should you ask her.", "NTA.  I suspect there are times that she wants to be left alone as well.  Having said that, I understand that women often have a higher tolerance for pain and/or distress and don\u2019t understand why guys can\u2019t just suck it up.  For example, for whatever reason, I tend to get more head colds  than my wife and she just gets pissed at me.", "NTA.  Women don't get fevers of 103 because of their period.  Source:  am woman.
