It caused one of the biggest arguments we have had as a couple to date (as a couple we get on pretty well and agree on most things and communicate well, so we have disagreements, but full blown arguments for us is rare). But it continues to be brought up by him and our friends so I agreed I\u2019d let Reddit decide. \n\nMe (25 at the time f)and my boyfriend (25 at the time m) had recently moved in together. He is in a band and every week on a Tuesday he has band practice. At the time, he would always go straight from work to practice and he would always order a take away between work and band for his tea that night and I would sort myself out. \n\nOne time, I fancied a dominos. For those who don\u2019t like in in the UK if it\u2019s different elsewhere, on Tuesdays dominos has \u201ctwo for Tuesdays\u201d where it\u2019s buy one get one free pizzas. When I ordered they asked if I wanted a second. My mindset for this question was: he always eats at band, and at the time we lived in an apartment block on the top floor with no lift so it was 4 (windy steep) floors to climb and carrying one pizza and my work bag up them was hard enough without the second one on top (risk of sliding and dropping). So I said no. \n\nWhen he got home, he asked what I\u2019d had for tea and I told him. He asked where his was and I explained I assumed he\u2019d eaten at work as normal so didn\u2019t get him one. He lost it. He stormed out the room and slammed the door shouting that I was selfish. I laughed to begin with because I thought he was playing but after about 10 minutes I realised he was being deadly serious. \n\nHis argument is it\u2019s a free pizza regardless, and I should have got him one for his lunch tomorrow if he wanted it and I hadn\u2019t thought about him at all. Now, I understood his points, and to me it was an oversight where I didn\u2019t think it through properly. But I think a full blown argument (which went on most of the night!) was over dramatic. I was being stupid but not an AH. Also, when he ordered take aways at work he never brought me anything home and I always sorted my own tea out on a Tuesday so shouldn\u2019t that work both ways? \n\nLike I say, it continues to be brought up by our friends who sided with him (in more of a jokey way now) but they\u2019re still adamant I was an AH.\n\nEDIT: thanks everyone for your replies! I did reply to a comment with this but more people are commenting so thought I should add it here. For the people commenting about his reaction being a red flag and concerns - from just reading this I understand that. But just to reassure people we\u2019ve been together 2 years and this reaction was completely out of character which is why I laughed and thought it was a joke. There have been no other reactions like this, and there are no worries with his anger. We have had disagreements about much bigger issues with no reactions like this. As below, he is clearly just very passionate about dominos! \n\nAlso to add, when I say it is still being brought up now- he\u2019s not bringing it up in an argumentative way. More of an ongoing joke, when dominos is mentioned he will make a joke of it. We both see the funny side of this now and both laugh at the jokes it\u2019s not an ongoing issue. But we still disagree about who was wrong in this situation (lightheardly!) which is why I said I\u2019d bring it here for Reddit to decide. He\u2019s not still angry about pizza a year on. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how split the opinions are on this! \nThanks \ud83d\ude0a", "created_utc": 1682784619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132zr0b/aita_for_not_getting_my_boyfriend_a_free_pizza/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no reason for him to storm around rather than saying, \"Oh, next time please get the free one if you have the option!  I'd really appreciate it.\"", "NTA, and who stays mad about pizza for a whole year? He needs to grow up and drop it.", "NTA but the communication in general here stinks. He shouldnt be so angry about it. \n\nBut\u2026..who turns down free pizza.", "NTA and not stupid either! You made a perfectly sound decision and he can get over it", "NTA. \n\nFor everyone saying \"E S H\" because \"it's a free pizza, how do you say no to a free pizza! it could be leftovers!!\" Speaking as a person who has had quite a few Thanksgiving turkeys given to my family for free when we couldn't afford it otherwise, people are more than allowed to say no to free things that they don't need. It doesn't make them an asshole at all. Especially if it's a *weekly* free thing---it's not like it was a one time offer to get something valuable or a necessity for free. It's a promotion for one free pizza that they could have gotten the next week.\n\nYou know what I think would make someone an asshole? Avoidable food waste. Why are you all assuming that OP and BF would have completely finished those leftovers? People leave leftovers until they go bad all the time. Besides, if it was any other day of the week, it wouldn't have mattered.", "It\u2019s hard for me to understand, maybe because America tends to have a different attitude to taking home food from restaurants/leftovers, so I\u2019m just sitting here wondering why you wouldn\u2019t take the pizza and stick it in the fridge? It\u2019d be there the next day or if he was peckish when he came home. Doesn\u2019t justify the level of anger he exhibited, because dude, it\u2019s just pizza and no one is going hungry.

But to expect you to do that for him and he never does the same for you? Hell no. NTA. He overreacted and I would be concerned going forward what this could mean for your future in the relationship. Not getting an extra Pizza is not the end of the world. But he acted very childish and was angry over it.", "NTA. It would have been nice if you\u2019d gotten him a pizza too since it was free.

Blowing up about it in the way that you describe sounds like a serious red flag. I\u2019d wonder if he had anger issues.", "Absolutely NTA.", "ESH Free pizza is *Free pizza*, you can warm it up and eat it later, and you just didn\u2019t get the free pizza. How much does it weigh, a whole pound or two? And who cares if it might slide off the stack and land upside down in the box, or whatever, you can still eat it. \n\nAnd WTF, overreact much, your BF? It\u2019s not the end of the world.", "ESH, you should have gotten the pizza because worst case scenario you got leftovers for later or you could have also texted him if he wanted anything. There is a common saying with the word assume.\n\nThe fact that this argument has persisted a year or even turned into a major argument is ridiculous. It tells me your bf is either a bit dramatic and needs to get over it or there is something missing from the story that he is mad about.", "ESH.  You could have ordered a free pizza and navigated the stairs, if you made it up, great, if the pizza dropped, oh well, it was free. So soft Y T A for not considering your BF, although mitigating that is the fact that you and he have always sorted tea alone on Tuesday. But he is a massive AH for his reaction and should have apologized. If he hasn\u2019t then \u2018 hey Boyfriend this is to you - grow up and apologize, how many times have you brought her a free pizza on Tuesday\u2019.", "Yta. I always get my partner something in a situation like this just in case they haven't eaten, or only managed to get a quick bite.", "YTA. You literally turned down FREE pizza. There isn't anything forgiveable about that.", "I'm kinda wanting to know where you can have pizza at tea. \n\nI hate scones.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that you're an AH for this, but I definitely don't understand your reasoning at all, and I don't think your BF is an AH for being upset with you either.\n\nAsking for half as much food as you're entitled to when you've paying the same price seems like a rather shameful waste of money to me, especially because, as he says, he didn't need to eat it that evening. Leftover pizza is yummy, and most people would be thrilled to get twice as much for the same price, and have extra pizza in the fridge for breakfast or lunch the next day. \n\nAnd your argument about carrying it upstairs . . . I mean, I'm quite severely physically disabled and I do get what you're saying, but a pizza-and-pizza box weigh next to nothing, and stacked on top of each other they're still quite not particularly unwieldy. With your bag slung over your shoulder, it shouldn't have added significantly to the difficulty of carrying them upstairs. This feels like sort of a \"I didn't really want to order extra so now I'm thinking of a reason why it was too difficult\" sort of reason.

He can order dominos himself.", "I am really waffling between N.A.H and E.S.H here. On one hand, yeah carrying pizza up with all your other shit is a hassle and you know his routine for these nights. On the other it would've been a nice thing to do for your bf and perhaps worth the struggle and extra time being careful up the stairs, plus it was free pizza. His reaction seems a bit much though. Then again, I've also lived in a walkup like thay and it is kind of a pain in the ass to immediately have to reverse course like that. \n\nI'm uncertain but going to go with ESH. Everybody here could've been kinder and/or more chill about shit.", "NTA for this but Yta for passing up soem free zaaa!", "NTA\n\nI mean yeah it would have been good to get the free pizza because someone would have eaten it eventually.

Throwing a fit isn't cute for a toddler, on a grow man it is ridiculous.  It would have been your pizza anyway. And the fact that it is still being brought up a YEAR later, in a \"joking\"way, means he is still butt hurt. Wah, wah, wah.", "NTA. It's none of his business whether you take the free pizza or not. His anger was blown out of proportion. I'd be angry as well but not enought to fuel a full an argument like what your bf did though. Not taking the free pizza is weird. You must be 3rd-generation rich. \ud83d\ude06", "Totally over the top but also: why would that be *his* free  pizza for *his* lunch. OP went to get it. OP paid for it. OP caused it home. *Why is it HiS and not OPs for lunch the next day?*\n\nThat in his mind her second pizza is for him and then he blows up to this level\u2026 nah. I\u2019d have taken that as a red flag that needed a serious discussion.", "Word\u2026I worked at a pizza place so on occasion my FWB would call for a free pizza and hookup (worked nights). One particular night he was begging for one and was not in the mood for anything. Ghosted him for being an a$$, moral of the story don\u2019t push it.\n\nNTA, BF needs to get over himself or might find himself single", "Smartest response I've seen today.", "Agreed. NTA.", "Tho I can agree that him getting mad about it was a totally unreasonable response to such a minor issue making him the AH.  Leftover thanksgiving can't be compared to a full new free pizza. No one wastes pizza, it would be eaten that night, or the latest next day.", "absolutely this!!!  couldn't have said it better myself NTA", "I\u2019ve got 4 free cans of watermelon beer sitting in my cupboard to attest to this", "I dont think it makes someone an AH, certainly not just generally. But it would be a problem if I lived with someone and they chose to pay the same amount for half of what they could get. Yes, if its gonna go to waste, then dont get it. But in a two person household, that pizza is gonna get eaten. \n\nIts not worth the big argument though. A simple \"for future reference get two if its on offer\" would suffice.", "Totally agree except it's pizza. Who doesn't eat pizza leftovers?", "Please stop. Who in the world doesn't know how left overs look like? What does a Left over pizza look like?\n\nWhy are you assuming they would have wasted the second pizza? OP clearly gorged down one alone. BF would have taken the others. \n\nWhat's up with all this selective outrage? If you can assume they wouldn't have finished two pizzas we can assume they would have.\n\nThe truth is that she simply didn't think of anyone beyond herself.", "Or even get it himself.", "Yes!!!! Exactly !!\n\nI had to scroll so far down to see this take. \n1) he got irrationally mad \n2) he was super entitled to think that extra pizza would be his! \n3) made worse by the fact that he NEVER brings her leftovers when he orders takeaway \n\nLike WTF \n\nNTA but your bf was 100% the AH", "Right?!? His reasoning is really confusing to me. So he gets to eat at band and also get her free pizza?", "Carrying two boxes of pizza with one hand up four flights of stairs is absolutely not something I\u2019d want to try", "Because sometimes you just don't want a second pizza.", "How long do you think leftover pizza lasts in the fridge and can you eat 2 whole pizzas in that time? Because I can\u2019t.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Sometimes I wonder about the median age of the members on this sub.", "Moral of the story YTA,a whole adult for ghosting someone over a Pizza", "Yeah\u2026the same way he was expected to fend for himself for a meal which he customarily does anyway. The situation about pizza doesn\u2019t warrant outrage. His reaction certainly does tho. The stakes aren\u2019t even that high", "It is extremely immature that he still using passive aggressive nonsense over a freaking Pizza that he was in no way entitled to is ridiculous. You should probably just disengage with him every single time he brings it up until he realizes he is acting like a little child throwing a fit a year later. It doesn't matter if it's a \"joke\". jokes are only funny if both people find them funny.", "I would ask him to stop making that joke. Seems passive aggressive and silly to me given your statements about his demeanor otherwise. It just implies over and over again that even though you think you did nothing wrong, he thinks you did and wants to keep it right at the edge to throw in your face.", "I\u2019m sorry OP, but this happening \u201cjust once\u201d in two years doesn\u2019t strike as an anomaly, rather a rare glimpse of his true self. Two years is still not so long in the grand scheme of things. I wonder how \u201cpassionately\u201d he would feel about other issues under stressful moments in your future lives, (ie. travel, baby, illness or death of family, etc). All jokes have semi-truths, and a year on for him to still be bringing this up is less joke, and more residual passive aggressive commentary\u2026..", "I get it but also it was free pizza. I would make it work. Buy a cheap plastic bag at any store for carrying. Okay maybe not that cheap that it breaks on the way home.", "Thank you! I cannot figure out why it\u2019s imperative she took the pizza. It\u2019s not a once in a lifetime thing nor does she speak about food insecurity. There is no reason needed for not accepting the offer. I had no idea pizza ethics were such a hot button issue", "Irrelevant.", "Yes, but at a proper tea? One that you don't have to prepare yourself?\n\nBut yes, excellent idea for pregaming football in autumn. Thanks for the lovely ideas.", "Thanks for your concern (not sarcastic!) but we have had much bigger issues with things like you listed and there hasn\u2019t been a dramatic response. Besides this, his response wasn\u2019t aggressive it was more of a paddy but not threatening in any kind of way. And I don\u2019t see the jokes as passive aggressive, we both do laugh when it happens and I call him the AH for his reaction and he calls me the AH for not getting the pizza - both lightheartedly now and not argumentative and both seeing the funny side. But because we couldn\u2019t agree after this time we decided to bring it here to see other peoples thoughts. I have made an edit to make this clear so people don\u2019t think it\u2019s still an issue in the relationship which would be ridiculous I would agree!", "And carry the pizzas on their edge?", "I can barely eat one whole pizza in a week the second one would be crusty as hell by the time I got to it.", "Thank you for clarifying. You see, you seem so funny, light hearted, smart, and cool. I think that\u2019s what prompted me to write at all. I hope you\u2019re right. And I wish you all the best. Just keep your eyes open, if for nothing else the kinds of things others are mentioning about his expectations in this situation (sorry btw NTA and not getting the 2nd pizza was reasonable considering the circumstances you had outlined)!"]}
