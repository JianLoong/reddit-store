It caused one of the biggest arguments we have had as a couple to date (as a couple we get on pretty well and agree on most things and communicate well, so we have disagreements, but full blown arguments for us is rare). But it continues to be brought up by him and our friends so I agreed I\u2019d let Reddit decide. \n\nMe (25 at the time f)and my boyfriend (25 at the time m) had recently moved in together. He is in a band and every week on a Tuesday he has band practice. At the time, he would always go straight from work to practice and he would always order a take away between work and band for his tea that night and I would sort myself out. \n\nOne time, I fancied a dominos. For those who don\u2019t like in in the UK if it\u2019s different elsewhere, on Tuesdays dominos has \u201ctwo for Tuesdays\u201d where it\u2019s buy one get one free pizzas. When I ordered they asked if I wanted a second. My mindset for this question was: he always eats at band, and at the time we lived in an apartment block on the top floor with no lift so it was 4 (windy steep) floors to climb and carrying one pizza and my work bag up them was hard enough without the second one on top (risk of sliding and dropping). So I said no. \n\nWhen he got home, he asked what I\u2019d had for tea and I told him. He asked where his was and I explained I assumed he\u2019d eaten at work as normal so didn\u2019t get him one. He lost it. He stormed out the room and slammed the door shouting that I was selfish. I laughed to begin with because I thought he was playing but after about 10 minutes I realised he was being deadly serious. \n\nHis argument is it\u2019s a free pizza regardless, and I should have got him one for his lunch tomorrow if he wanted it and I hadn\u2019t thought about him at all. Now, I understood his points, and to me it was an oversight where I didn\u2019t think it through properly. But I think a full blown argument (which went on most of the night!) was over dramatic. I was being stupid but not an AH. Also, when he ordered take aways at work he never brought me anything home and I always sorted my own tea out on a Tuesday so shouldn\u2019t that work both ways? \n\nLike I say, it continues to be brought up by our friends who sided with him (in more of a jokey way now) but they\u2019re still adamant I was an AH.", "created_utc": 1682784619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132zr0b/aita_for_not_getting_my_boyfriend_a_free_pizza/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If my husband had the opportunity to get me a free pizza and didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be like \u201caww that\u2019s too bad, I would have really wanted a free pizza\u201d. But a response as angry as what you described sounds a little over the top, especially if he doesn\u2019t typically expect you to spontaneously have a free meal waiting for him when you get food for yourself.", "NTA. You're both adults, perfectly capable of feeding yourselves. You took care of YOU. \n\nThe fact this is still an issue a year later speaks volumes. His maturity level must be extremely low. It was a freaking pizza, get over it.", "Stupid, bad idea, mistake, oversight...yes.   AH?  No, it isn't that serious.  NTA.", "NTA.   There's no reason for him to storm around rather than saying, \"Oh, next time please get the free one if you have the option!  I'd really appreciate it.\"", "NTA, and who stays mad about pizza for a whole year? He needs to grow up and drop it.", "NTA but the communication in general here stinks. He shouldnt be so angry about it. \n\nBut\u2026..who turns down free pizza.", "NTA and not stupid either! You made a perfectly sound decision and he can get over it", "NTA. \n\nFor everyone saying \"E S H\" because \"it's a free pizza, how do you say no to a free pizza! it could be leftovers!!\" Speaking as a person who has had quite a few Thanksgiving turkeys given to my family for free when we couldn't afford it otherwise, people are more than allowed to say no to free things that they don't need. It doesn't make them an asshole at all. Especially if it's a *weekly* free thing---it's not like it was a one time offer to get something valuable or a necessity for free. It's a promotion for one free pizza that they could have gotten the next week.\n\nYou know what I think would make someone an asshole? Avoidable food waste. Why are you all assuming that OP and BF would have completely finished those leftovers? People leave leftovers until they go bad all the time. Besides, if it was any other day of the week, it wouldn't have mattered.", "It\u2019s hard for me to understand, maybe because America tends to have a different attitude to taking home food from restaurants/leftovers, so I\u2019m just sitting here wondering why you wouldn\u2019t take the pizza and stick it in the fridge? It\u2019d be there the next day or if he was peckish when he came home. Doesn\u2019t justify the level of anger he exhibited, because dude, it\u2019s just pizza and no one is going hungry. But really don\u2019t get your choice here. NTA", "NTA.  Your bf sounds like he's 12", "NTA  - he doesn't get you food on Tuesdays so you don't think to get him food.", "I would at you are NTA as it\u2019s not your responsibility to feed him, at the same time I understand where he\u2019s comi mg from.", ">to me it was an oversight where I didn\u2019t think it through properly. But I think a full blown argument (which went on most of the night!) was over dramatic. I was being stupid but not an AH. \n\nAgreed. NTA.", "NTA. It really wasn't serious enough for all the drama he created.", "I think it\u2019s silly to decline free food, since you could have saved it for leftovers if you didn\u2019t want it that night. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but I also would be annoyed with my partner if they did what you did. But the way your partner responded is over the top, and fact that you both are still fighting about it seems immature and overly dramatic. So I guess I\u2019ll go with ESH.", "NTA I would\u2019ve said no because he arranges meals on Tuesday for himself. Bringing home extra pizza that\u2019s not needed or wanted could lead to food waste. If he wanted free pizza, he could get one the next Tuesday. It\u2019s an extreme overreaction on his part and he sounds like a child. Especially since it\u2019s still being brought up. Dude needs to get over jt.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid or an oversight. You explained why you didn\u2019t get the second pizza. You had enough to carry and didn\u2019t want to drop your pizza by being overloaded on steep winding stairs. If he offered to help you get them home that would be one thing. But to expect you to do that for him and he never does the same for you? Hell no. NTA. He overreacted and I would be concerned going forward what this could mean for your future in the relationship. Not getting an extra Pizza is not the end of the world. But he acted very childish and was angry over it.", "NTA. It would have been nice if you\u2019d gotten him a pizza too since it was free. But that\u2019s all he had to say. Hey honey, can you get me one next time? I\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t get one. That\u2019s literally it. Blowing up about it in the way that you describe sounds like a serious red flag. I\u2019d wonder if he had anger issues.", "Absolutely NTA.", "ESH Free pizza is *Free pizza*, you can warm it up and eat it later, and you just didn\u2019t get the free pizza. How much does it weigh, a whole pound or two? And who cares if it might slide off the stack and land upside down in the box, or whatever, you can still eat it. \n\nAnd WTF, overreact much, your BF? It\u2019s not the end of the world.", "ESH, you should have gotten the pizza because worst case scenario you got leftovers for later or you could have also texted him if he wanted anything. There is a common saying with the word assume.\n\nThe fact that this argument has persisted a year or even turned into a major argument is ridiculous. It tells me your bf is either a bit dramatic and needs to get over it or there is something missing from the story that he is mad about.", "ESH.  You could have ordered a free pizza and navigated the stairs, if you made it up, great, if the pizza dropped, oh well, it was free. So soft Y T A for not considering your BF, although mitigating that is the fact that you and he have always sorted tea alone on Tuesday. But he is a massive AH for his reaction and should have apologized. If he hasn\u2019t then \u2018 hey Boyfriend this is to you - grow up and apologize, how many times have you brought her a free pizza on Tuesday\u2019.", "Yta. I always get my partner something in a situation like this just in case they haven't eaten, or only managed to get a quick bite.", "YTA. You literally turned down FREE pizza. There isn't anything forgiveable about that.", "I'm kinda wanting to know where you can have pizza at tea. \n\nI hate scones.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that you're an AH for this, but I definitely don't understand your reasoning at all, and I don't think your BF is an AH for being upset with you either.\n\nAsking for half as much food as you're entitled to when you've paying the same price seems like a rather shameful waste of money to me, especially because, as he says, he didn't need to eat it that evening. Leftover pizza is yummy, and most people would be thrilled to get twice as much for the same price, and have extra pizza in the fridge for breakfast or lunch the next day. \n\nAnd your argument about carrying it upstairs . . . I mean, I'm quite severely physically disabled and I do get what you're saying, but a pizza-and-pizza box weigh next to nothing, and stacked on top of each other they're still quite not particularly unwieldy. With your bag slung over your shoulder, it shouldn't have added significantly to the difficulty of carrying them upstairs. This feels like sort of a \"I didn't really want to order extra so now I'm thinking of a reason why it was too difficult\" sort of reason. Again, you're not an AH . . . but it was unkind.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He can order dominos himself.", "I am really waffling between N.A.H and E.S.H here. On one hand, yeah carrying pizza up with all your other shit is a hassle and you know his routine for these nights. On the other it would've been a nice thing to do for your bf and perhaps worth the struggle and extra time being careful up the stairs, plus it was free pizza. His reaction seems a bit much though. Then again, I've also lived in a walkup like thay and it is kind of a pain in the ass to immediately have to reverse course like that. \n\nI'm uncertain but going to go with ESH. Everybody here could've been kinder and/or more chill about shit.", "NTA for this but Yta for passing up soem free zaaa!", "NTA\n\nI mean yeah it would have been good to get the free pizza because someone would have eaten it eventually. But it wasn\u2019t like you were trying to leave him without dinner. His reaction was really extreme and overblown.

This the only time I can think of he\u2019s reacted like this. The reaction was so out of character which is why I assumed he was joking and laughed at him at the time. \n\nJust to give clarity on this for anyone worried. He\u2019s just very passionate about free dominos. Also for the people saying he\u2019s still angry a year on, I want to clarify he\u2019s not still arguing about it a year on but he\u2019ll bring it up as a joke for example \u201cshall we get a dominos tonight?\u201d And hell make jokes that he\u2019s going to order one and not for me.
