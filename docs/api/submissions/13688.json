The (seemingly) objective players here are YOUR parents, who have a 10-year-old granddaughter who was in the hospital while their elder granddaughter was getting married and their son (you) chose the hospital. For some reason not in your original post, your own parents and your 10-year-old's grandparents sided with the bride.

Who misses their child's wedding because someone twisted their ankle? Did they even need to go to the hospital? And you stood her up at her own wedding...you literally ditched your daughter's wedding and didn't even tell her you weren't showing up. Did it ever occur to you that they might have delayed the ceremony while they waited for you? That maybe you humiliated her in front of friends and family?

Did you even call and tell your daughter you wouldn't be at the wedding and you are going to a hospital? Before the wedding not after I mean. Honestly there's just so much missing info and really weird circumstances here that I'm leaning towards this being a fake.", "YTA You prioritised one daughter over another and in doing so not only ruined your relationship with your daughter, by showing her that your other daughter comes first, but did so on one of the most important days of her life when she wanted to share her special day by having her dad with her on her wedding day.\n\nShe ( your daughter ) is not being dramatic over your no show, regardless of what your wife says. I'm also speculating  that your wife isn't your daughters mother and potentially her step parent and this is your second family because that's what it comes across as, as well as what your wife has said about her being dramatic about you not attending. I'm also guessing that your wife was also not invited to the wedding as well.\n\nYour daughter is extremely hurt by your actions, because not only did you no show to her wedding, but you also didn't call her to let her know what was happening. \n\nYour other daughter twisted her ankle, is she under 18? If not could've she stayed at the hospital by herself if she was over 18? Or could\u2019ve you had a friend come and look after her?\nAfter you found out that it was not a broken ankle then why didn't you call your other daughter to explain that you thought that your child had an accident, nothing major ie no broken bones and were then on your way to her wedding and kept her informed of the situation so she was aware of not only what was happening, but also why you were delayed\n\nYou need to accept the consequences of your own actions that your daughter doesn't want anything to do with you now, and in the future, as you've now seen by her blocking you and the family from communicating with her.\n\nBecause again YOU chose one daughter over another on their wedding day, hurt her feelings, and also embarrassed her by not showing up.", "YTA wow. U missed her wedding and calling \"skipped your mind\"!?! Wtf you're lucky if she ever talks to you again.

This is an ice pack and wrap it situation, not a hospital situation. \n\nNever in my 28 years of parenting have I had a child screaming nonstop over a twist of an ankle.

I usually try not to speculate too much but....I don't know, things just read odd to me and I'm just going to bullet-point the biggest ones here:\n\n* You said your daughter having to go to + being in the hospital prevented you from attending the wedding, which means it happened earlier in the day before the wedding started (even if just before as you were about to leave). Weddings take, on average, 4-5 hours; *Not* 5-10 minutes. You also state that your oldest daughter didn't call you until *'that night',* which makes it sound like she didn't call you until after everything was wrapped up. No matter how I look at it, I cannot see *how* you managed to forget - for 4+ hours - entirely about your eldest daughter and her wedding on what is generally considered one of the most special days for the two people getting married.\n* Your wife so quickly and easily dismissed her being upset at your failure to attend or even call her and I just...again, I can't wrap my head around her being able to do this unless it's something that is regularly done. She says she's being dramatic but the thing is, she's *not*. Most people, when getting married, want their parents to be there for them; it's one of the 'important' aspects for them. Fuck man, I had a *shit* relationship with my father; he was abusive in all the ways (yes, including sexually), I had to move 3k miles away to escape him, and you know what? The little girl in me, the one that just wants her papa to be there for her to love and support her the way a dad is supposed to, was sad because that she knew - *I knew* \\- that was never a possibility and it wasn't even something I could try to have because of how he was. You failed her, you weren't there for her on a day that was supposed to be special and important for her. You didn't call to let her know why, you just weren't there, and it's not something you can get back. You don't get a do-over of this day and nothing you do will make up for you not being there. Not being in the photos or having video of the father-daughter dance. You failed, you fucked up and it is ***beyond reasonable*** for her to be as upset as she is about it and it is *absolutely mind boggling* that your wife would call her dramatic over this.\n* This last one is short and sweet. She blocked 'the whole family' over this; I'm going to take that to mean that she blocked you and - importantly to this point - *your wife* (henceforth referred to has her mom because it reads better). Why did she block her mom? She was out of town and couldn't be at the wedding, your daughter knew this. The only reason I can think of for her to block her mom would be because ***she knew*** that her mom would **dismiss** her feelings and **defend** your failings.\n\nYou fucked up, YTA.\n\nEdit: I was reading other comments and I didn't even think about the possibility that your wife and youngest are her stepmom and half sibling rather than her biological mother and full sibling. But it doesn't change my bullet points, in fact if this is the case, it sadly makes them fall into place all the more perfectly with the blended family bullshit that seems all too common.", "YTA - let me guess, you were not scheduled to walk your daughter down the aisle?", "YTA for the big bits missing so shaping the story to make you sound better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife was out of town when your daughter got married - why?\n\nYou couldn't even ring to miss a WEDDING because a 10yr old was crying - why?\n\nNo-one rang you to check where you were?\n\nA sprained ankle is an xray and some strapping - not an all day affair.

Severe sprains need professional medical attention, lots of people end up on crutches with sprains, and I\u2019ve known people who sprained their ankle and it took longer to heal than broken ankles - taking your kid to the ER was the sensible decision.

Was it a sprain or a break? Most people go to urgent care for a sprain to get pain meds and a wrap/boot. It hurts but not to the point of hours of crying and screaming.

Older daughter doesn't even rate a second thought on her wedding day. Absolutely disgusting and you will probably never hear from your older daughter again.

But a lot of people negotiate it down, agree to a payment plan, ignore it and take their chances with collections, or even give a fake identity to escape the bill. \n\nAt urgent care centers, you either have to have insurance or pay by cash or credit card up front.
