The (seemingly) objective players here are YOUR parents, who have a 10-year-old granddaughter who was in the hospital while their elder granddaughter was getting married and their son (you) chose the hospital. For some reason not in your original post, your own parents and your 10-year-old's grandparents sided with the bride.  I don't want to conclude that something is being hidden, but that is the appearance and a serious concern.

Who misses their child's wedding because someone twisted their ankle? Did they even need to go to the hospital? And you stood her up at her own wedding...you literally ditched your daughter's wedding and didn't even tell her you weren't showing up. Did it ever occur to you that they might have delayed the ceremony while they waited for you? That maybe you humiliated her in front of friends and family?

Did you even call and tell your daughter you wouldn't be at the wedding and you are going to a hospital? Before the wedding not after I mean. Honestly there's just so much missing info and really weird circumstances here that I'm leaning towards this being a fake.", "YTA You prioritised one daughter over another and in doing so not only ruined your relationship with your daughter, by showing her that your other daughter comes first, but did so on one of the most important days of her life when she wanted to share her special day by having her dad with her on her wedding day.\n\nShe ( your daughter ) is not being dramatic over your no show, regardless of what your wife says. I'm also speculating  that your wife isn't your daughters mother and potentially her step parent and this is your second family because that's what it comes across as, as well as what your wife has said about her being dramatic about you not attending. I'm also guessing that your wife was also not invited to the wedding as well.\n\nYour daughter is extremely hurt by your actions, because not only did you no show to her wedding, but you also didn't call her to let her know what was happening. \n\nYour other daughter twisted her ankle, is she under 18? If not could've she stayed at the hospital by herself if she was over 18? Or could\u2019ve you had a friend come and look after her?\nAfter you found out that it was not a broken ankle then why didn't you call your other daughter to explain that you thought that your child had an accident, nothing major ie no broken bones and were then on your way to her wedding and kept her informed of the situation so she was aware of not only what was happening, but also why you were delayed\n\nYou need to accept the consequences of your own actions that your daughter doesn't want anything to do with you now, and in the future, as you've now seen by her blocking you and the family from communicating with her.\n\nBecause again YOU chose one daughter over another on their wedding day, hurt her feelings, and also embarrassed her by not showing up.", "YTA wow. U missed her wedding and calling \"skipped your mind\"!?! Wtf you're lucky if she ever talks to you again.

This is an ice pack and wrap it situation, not a hospital situation. \n\nNever in my 28 years of parenting have I had a child screaming nonstop over a twist of an ankle.

I usually try not to speculate too much but....I don't know, things just read odd to me and I'm just going to bullet-point the biggest ones here:\n\n* You said your daughter having to go to + being in the hospital prevented you from attending the wedding, which means it happened earlier in the day before the wedding started (even if just before as you were about to leave). Weddings take, on average, 4-5 hours; *Not* 5-10 minutes. You also state that your oldest daughter didn't call you until *'that night',* which makes it sound like she didn't call you until after everything was wrapped up. No matter how I look at it, I cannot see *how* you managed to forget - for 4+ hours - entirely about your eldest daughter and her wedding on what is generally considered one of the most special days for the two people getting married.\n* Your wife so quickly and easily dismissed her being upset at your failure to attend or even call her and I just...again, I can't wrap my head around her being able to do this unless it's something that is regularly done. She says she's being dramatic but the thing is, she's *not*. Most people, when getting married, want their parents to be there for them; it's one of the 'important' aspects for them. Fuck man, I had a *shit* relationship with my father; he was abusive in all the ways (yes, including sexually), I had to move 3k miles away to escape him, and you know what? The little girl in me, the one that just wants her papa to be there for her to love and support her the way a dad is supposed to, was sad because that she knew - *I knew* \\- that was never a possibility and it wasn't even something I could try to have because of how he was. You failed her, you weren't there for her on a day that was supposed to be special and important for her. You didn't call to let her know why, you just weren't there, and it's not something you can get back. You don't get a do-over of this day and nothing you do will make up for you not being there. Not being in the photos or having video of the father-daughter dance. You failed, you fucked up and it is ***beyond reasonable*** for her to be as upset as she is about it and it is *absolutely mind boggling* that your wife would call her dramatic over this.\n* This last one is short and sweet. She blocked 'the whole family' over this; I'm going to take that to mean that she blocked you and - importantly to this point - *your wife* (henceforth referred to has her mom because it reads better). Why did she block her mom? She was out of town and couldn't be at the wedding, your daughter knew this. The only reason I can think of for her to block her mom would be because ***she knew*** that her mom would **dismiss** her feelings and **defend** your failings.\n\nYou fucked up, YTA.\n\nEdit: I was reading other comments and I didn't even think about the possibility that your wife and youngest are her stepmom and half sibling rather than her biological mother and full sibling. But it doesn't change my bullet points, in fact if this is the case, it sadly makes them fall into place all the more perfectly with the blended family bullshit that seems all too common.", "YTA - let me guess, you were not scheduled to walk your daughter down the aisle?", "YTA for the big bits missing so shaping the story to make you sound better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife was out of town when your daughter got married - why?\n\nYou couldn't even ring to miss a WEDDING because a 10yr old was crying - why?\n\nNo-one rang you to check where you were?\n\nA sprained ankle is an xray and some strapping - not an all day affair.

Severe sprains need professional medical attention, lots of people end up on crutches with sprains, and I\u2019ve known people who sprained their ankle and it took longer to heal than broken ankles - taking your kid to the ER was the sensible decision.

Was it a sprain or a break? Most people go to urgent care for a sprain to get pain meds and a wrap/boot. It hurts but not to the point of hours of crying and screaming.

They can run X-rays pretty quick.", "Non emergency emergencies get to wait many hours, at least where I am. \n\nI do think that it's odd the guy never notified anyone of what was up. Why would he not be able to send a quick text while waiting?", "I\u2019m saying that if a 10 year old is constantly screaming over a sprain, there is an issue. I\u2019ve sprained my ankles many times, from the ages of 6-14 (not to mention all the times as an adult) and only screamed at the moment it actually got injured. Yeah it hurt when weight was put on it, maybe even had tears, but never screamed nonstop. \n\nIf she was 6 or younger I\u2019d say it\u2019s normal, but she\u2019s old enough to not be acting like that. Because that\u2019s how you get stuck in the ER for hours just to find out it was just a sprain.\n\nEdit to add: I guess my reading comprehension sucks\u2026 she wasn\u2019t screaming nonstop, she was crying nonstop\u2026 to which my statement still stands, a 10 year old shouldn\u2019t be crying nonstop over a sprain unless she actively has weight on it.", "He wasn\u2019t clear on how intense the twisting was; no mention of bruising, swelling or it being broken.  I get the high level of pain and applaud him for taking her to the hospital BUT it didn\u2019t seem like an all day affair, like if she broke her ankle.", "Where did I say anything about leaving a 10 year old alone?  Did not mention it in any of my comments so stop making up stuff just to argue.  OP taking her to the hospital isn\u2019t the issue, OP missing the wedding over a freaking TWISTED ankle is the issue.  Treating a twisted ankle is not an all day affair.", "Sounds like the daughter was in a lot of pain, and you don't always know that it's just a twisted ankle until you get an x-ray.", "I guess I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t know if it would be prudent to put a 10 yr old on the couch with an ice pack with an unknown ankle injury to go to the wedding. What if she had to go to the bathroom and it was actually broken? She could do real damage. I completely don\u2019t disagree that the fact that he didn\u2019t effectively communicate what was happening or try to switch out with family was lousy. It was lousy. But this was not a desirable situation to begin with.", "Ummm. I doubt this was the case for the OP\u2019s daughter but I already have rods in my legs from previous surgery so any time I have significant swelling near my screws(ankle, knee) it\u2019s off to the er for me. This is bc I can break my metal(I am the one in a million). Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t care if it\u2019s my own wedding we are getting X-rays before we pass go and collect two hundred", "How on earth was he supposed to know that in the moment? In hindsight, of course you\u2019re right.", "Um. Thanks for the all caps. I can\u2019t read unless people are screaming at me to get their point across. I literally said this exact thing in my other comment.", "Even a simple \"... Is in the hospital. Can't make it\" would have been better than nothing", "Yeah ideally he would have contacted one of the people at the wedding and switched out but I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable, since he would have had to deal with medical decisions and insurance and mom was out of town. What was he supposed to do, a power of attorney to give someone authority to make medical decisions in the moment? Maybe he could have.\n\nNone is this was ideal and the lack of communication to the older daughter in the moment was very bad. But he\u2019s NTA generally for looking out for the welfare of his 10 yo.", "But did you think it was broken? Also, you fell. OP didn't say anything about the child falling.", "That would\u2019ve given him more time to call and let someone know he wasn\u2019t coming. He\u2019d be sitting in the waiting room in a suit or tux. That\u2019s have to remind him he was meant to do something that day. I\u2019d also assume someone would\u2019ve called him and ask where he was at least. I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t take his daughter to the hospital but it seems like he had time to reach out but chose not to.", "You do if you don't want Daddy to go to half-sister's wedding.", "I misread it earlier and didn't realise that he didn't even initiate the phone call where she told him truthfully how bad he is as a father. His already flimsy excise that he couldn't call because his other daughter was crying and needed him completely falls apart - was there not 2 minutes during the many hours she wasn't crying at all?", "Yes urgent care/walk ins should be the first choice, but not every city has an urgent care. Closest walk in is more than an hour away, hospital? It's down the road from me. \n\nAnd people with certain conditions or atleast i get told to go to ER instead because of a disease I have.\n\nNow we don't know OP's reasons why he went to ER instead, but it could very well be the only thing near him. \n\nPlus I know in a lot of low income places people go to ER instead because they will not be denied treatment if they don't have any money. I know too many people that don't have them/their kids on insurance which usually is always a contributing factor as to why they cannot go to urgent cares or doctors offices.", "Your tales of childhood injuries going untreated sound negligent. Or you grew up in the third world.", "Right so you're daughter hurt herself, is crying, you take her to figure out what went wrong and since the result is that its less serious than you thought, you're an asshole, even though you had literally no way of knowing until the doctors finished the tests?\n\n\nOp is truly an asshole for not being an orthopedic doctor that knew before the wedding that it was a sprain and not something more serious\n\n\"I ended up staying with her at the hospital\" is the key fucking phrase that this entire subreddit is ignoring. How the fuck is a non doctor supposed to judge it's bullshit until the hospital tells you???", "The dad would absolutely come check on her. Given his overwhelming favoring of the younger daughter, he would probably check on her every 30 minutes. To miss a wedding and be justified, it would have to be a true medical emergency. This was not it. I\u2019m guessing that if you\u2019re a parent (and I think you are), you probably lean more to the helicopter parenting model. It\u2019s popular, but not very healthy for the children.", "Obviously, that would change things, but like you said, it\u2019s probably not the case here or he would have mentioned that in the post.", "Well that isn't what's happening here.", "That sounds like a shit show and as someone with health problems I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that", "There are a surprising number of people in your situation. Including my dad who was run over by an suv and refused amputation.", "You can definitely look/fell the difference between a broken and twisted ankle...", "Phones actually exist, and I'm willing to bet that OP owns a mobile one. They would just need to call the parent to make medical decisions, not get POA. Better yet, the wife probably has her own phone, as well, and I bet she is also capable of making medical decisions for her daughter. I took my cousin to the hospital when he was a minor. His mom gave the insurance information over the phone, from 2 states away, because phones can communicate over long distances.", "Ha I never said they went untreated, I said that I wasn\u2019t making a big deal and crying nonstop about it. \n\nMy father is a doctor so when he got home he would assess it, wrap it, and have me get off my feet for as much as possible until it healed. If it was really bad my mom would take me to his office.", "Btw, I have a kickass sister and if this were my wedding and she were ten I would WANT him with her, not me. I can renew my vows later if it means so much.", "Not a parent!", "Thank you for informing me about the existence of phones. I shall look into this immediately and procure one.", "Serious question: Have you ever twisted your ankle before? It sounds like you're imagining something very different from what a twisted ankle actually is", "But, that\u2019s not what is happening here. The bride didn\u2019t make this call. He did and he didn\u2019t bother to tell her. You may view this as a true medical emergency and I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else left to say other than most people agree that this could have waited or been sped up at an urgent care.", "I have, but I have never had a 10 yr old with an injury that may or may not look serious that I can\u2019t diagnose myself", "I don\u2019t know what else to say other than I have said many times he needed to communicate this to his older daughter, I\u2019m not sure how many times I can say it"]}
