I think it was more so that Ariel had already been out of high school for a year by that point. Unfortunately, no matter what, the average student will lose a lot of friends after graduating high school. I know me and my current friends did. \n\nIt isn't anyone's fault. It's just a lot harder to maintain friendships when you don't see each other every day anymore. People go on different life paths and just may not be compatible anymore. A lot of big life changes happen fast, and you just don't have the time to consistently keep in touch with everyone.

I emphasized to Ariel that I see our parents as being the biggest ones at fault, because it was their choice to openly favor her and that was out of her control. I told her that, at the same time, she's now 20 and choosing to rub it in our faces means she isn't just an innocent victim anymore.

I find this sub is too extreme with assigning blame. This is a tough situation for everyone involved. Your sisters are getting a raw deal from your parents. It's their job to love their kids equally regardless of their own interests. And it's hard for someone to admit their privilege. What is Ariel supposed to do when she's called out for it? I understand she doesn't have the best reaction, but I'm struggling to think how she's the responsible one in this situation. She's your parents favourite but clearly her siblings dislike her. Your other sisters and you have it tough but you have each other.

Ariel could say something such as \"You're right, it isn't fair that our parents are ignoring you\" or \"Our parents should have the same amount of interest/consideration for you since you're also their daughters.\" My parents are the biggest ones at fault because they choose to favor Ariel, and that's out of her control. What is in her control is rubbing it in our faces. Telling our 12 and 14-year-old sisters that it's their fault that our dad ignores them is a choice for Ariel.  She's no longer an innocent victim in my eyes now that she is 20 and still making those kinds of choices.", "The parents are the major assholes. They are fully responsible for all of it. These 2 daughters are also assholes (other sisters might be 2 but not enough info).\n\nThis is less of a aita question bad more of relationship question. Start with do either want a relationship with each other. If the answer is yes, then they (all 4) need to sit down and discuss how their parents treatment caused this divide and how they need to adjust their behaviors moving forward so that they may have a relationship in the future.\n\nESH especially parents"]}
