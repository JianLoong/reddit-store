It's just a lot harder to maintain friendships when you don't see each other every day anymore. People go on different life paths and just may not be compatible anymore.

No the favoritism isn't her fault, but what is her fault is throwing it in the faces of two literal children.  A good, caring sister wouldn't have thrown in their faces that she's the favorite.  She would have tried to find a way to help them feel more important in some way, as you have.  What she has done to those children is not ok.

She *is* a victim; during crucial developmental periods, she dealt with the guilt of seeing her siblings treated poorly in comparison to her, and she\u2019s likely internalized horrible anxiety trying to keep their love. I doubt she was trying to make fun of you by citing what could be done differently; she was trying to cope with the cognitive dissonance of her situation by suggesting ways you could level the playing field, so to speak. She probably has few other sources of love and support because everyone can see she\u2019s got your parents, so she feels she has to love them and be able to trust them. \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for suggesting hobbies you could take up to earn similar love and support; she has to think she\u2019s doing something right, because otherwise her only consistent support network could toss her aside arbitrarily at any time.

did you invite her & liase with her on how to get there? how old would she have been then & would she have had the freedom & wherewithal to attend without your parents taking her? \n\ni am not at all trying to guilt you or saying you are in any way responsible for your sister so please forgive me if i comes across like that. i just think that now she has been faced with the consequences of what your parents' favour actually means (something she may not have realised or been able to conceptualise prior to this moment) she may be regretting her actions & words & hoping for a relationship with you all.\n\nyou did absolutely nothing wrong in this situation. lifting your other sisters up for their own individual achievements seperate from ariel was actually a wonderful thing to do. i'm sure they felt safe & loved & will forever remember your kindness. \n\nbut now that ariel has seen you are unwilling to bend to her & is apparently experiencing some kind of issues with her social circle (do you know why less people turned up to her birthday than she expected?

To that extent she is 'also a victim'. However what you did was the equivalent of 'All four of us inherited diabetes, three of us do what we need to to stay healthy, you are about to eat your 6th donut of the day.' not of spiking her food with sugar.", "NTA - Ariel is no longer a child and shouldn\u2019t be playing off her favourite status", "Sorry this is so long, I started writing it and it kind of brought up some personal things for me, reading it for editing I\u2019ve just realised it\u2019s a lot and this whole post might just be rambling self-projection. So, deep breath\u2026  \n   \nIt's entirely possible that neither of you ITA here. Ariel is the favourite, but that's not really her fault, as you said. I sincerely doubt that she is so desperate to be the favourite daughter that she would risk being the outcast sister. What she said to you and your sisters about 'if you liked this, dad would like you more' could have been meant as a snub. Without being there to hear how she said it, it\u2019s very difficult to tell. But reading it as you wrote it, to my mind it could just be her genuinely trying to help and give advice. She might have meant it as literally that \u2013 try these activities and your dad will have more time for you. That doesn\u2019t mean that you should have to do those things \u2013 it kind of sucks that your dad is only interested in you when you do things he likes \u2013 but that\u2019s not Ariel\u2019s fault it\u2019s still advice that makes sense from her point of view.\n\n  \nYou said that you didn\u2019t go to each other\u2019s graduation, in part because she didn\u2019t invite you. But there could be a lot of reasons for that. Often big events are not the sort of thing that people feel they need to explicitly invite siblings to. I doubt most people would actually sit down with close family members and say \u2018hey, are you coming to my wedding/birthday/baby shower/whatever. My brother never invited me formally to his wedding. If he had actually sat me down and said \u2018do you want to come?\u2019 it would have feel weird to me. Like, of course I\u2019m coming, why do you even need to ask? You also said you don\u2019t talk to Ariel much anyway, which adds another possibility for why she didn\u2019t ask \u2013 fear of being rejected. Or if you mostly avoid talking to her, she might have genuinely thought you didn\u2019t want her there. I\u2019m not saying any of this is your fault, I\u2019m just trying to imagine how she might see it. I might be completely wrong and maybe she\u2019s just a dick who doesn\u2019t care about you. But if she\u2019s upset at what you said to her then I doubt it. \n\n  \nI don\u2019t have any sisters. You have two that you get on with and that\u2019s great, but the one closest to you in age you don\u2019t get on with and honestly that sucks for both of you. I have one brother, 3 years older than me, and he\u2019s fucking awesome. He\u2019s the proudest thing in my life. But we argued all the time as kids and in my early twenties we weren\u2019t that close. It took a long time to get near to him again, but I\u2019m incredibly happy I did. Yet even now, sometimes we piss each other off and argue. Sometimes the arguments feel massive, but compared to the years we\u2019ve spent together, even major fights are meaningless. \n\n  \nFriends can come and go but your siblings (and other family members too, of course) are the only people who will always stay the same. If you\u2019re close to her that\u2019s one person who will be there for your entire life to share and grow with. And sometimes doing that is incredibly hard and frustrating. But if you continue to grow apart it will only get harder and harder to bridge the gap. Maybe it feels like that\u2019s not worth doing now, but honestly as someone who has been through a rocky siblingship (is that a word?) in my early twenties, I can tell that in ten years none of this shit will matter. You\u2019ll all be living your lives, moving to new places, maybe getting married and having kids of your own. And those connections to your past will be more and more important. Or maybe they won\u2019t. Maybe they\u2019ll just\u2026 fade away, into nothingness. You\u2019ll talk less and less and each time have less to talk about. Seeing each other will feel more and more like an obligation and you\u2019ll both grow bitter towards each other. Is that truly what either of you want?\n\n  \nI hope you can fix things between the two of you. It sounds like she wants to and the fact that you are writing here means you probably recognise the situation could be better too. I think you both have that in common, just as you both blame each other for things that aren\u2019t entirely in your control.\n\n  \nDon\u2019t let your childhoods define how you are as adults. Don\u2019t let the shitty things you have both done or said to each other grow into more and more shitty things in the future. You\u2019ve got fifty more years of knowing each other and they can be wonderful years, but only the longer you both leave things that harder it will be. Send her a text, tell her you love her. Invite her to a bar, anything. It\u2019s not all on you, but if you can be the one to bring her back into the fold, she\u2019ll love you forever for it.\n\nBest of luck.  \nTL:DR Siblings are awesome, keep them as close as possible!", "NTA she sounds terrible", "I would've felt bad for Ariel if she wouldn't rub it in the faces of her sisters.

But if she\u2019s coming face to face with how that\u2019s affected her relationships with family now, then framing your problems with her in terms of her behaviors might actually bring about change. I\u2019m not necessarily saying you want a relationship with her, but if you\u2019re interested in your relationship changing (and I really do mean IF, it\u2019s your choice ultimately), then it might be a good idea to walk back saying \u201ci don\u2019t like or care about you\u201d (although I understand that she put you on the spot and you were just speaking your truth). \n\nI understand why people feel bad for Ariel though; she seems to not have faced the pain of not receiving special attention or praise, but now she is, from my perspective, for one of the first and most significant times in her life. \n\nThe message of \u201cI don\u2019t like or care about you\u201d (although I think it\u2019s totally reasonable that you conveyed that) is where I really understand the sympathy for Ariel.

If you\u2019re interested, I would recommend initiating another conversation in which you say \u201cit\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like you, but you treat me poorly [in the ways you described in the post].\u201d Maybe even a \u201cwe could have a stronger relationship if you treated me with the respect and care you\u2019re asking me to treat you with.\u201d", "I read the ages wrong and thought \u201cwow, that\u2019s harsh to say to a 14 yr old\u201d, then I saw that she was twenty!  This is the consequences of her own actions as much as her parents. NTA", "NTA. Crucify the bourgeoisie.", "First of all, I'm so sorry that your parents have failed you. They failed and continue to fail all of you- including Ariel- but particularly you and your two youngest siblings.  \nFavouritism amongst children by parents is extraordinarily damaging for a family dynamic. It can create triangulation- where the favoured child is used as a way to exert control over their siblings- to fulfil what the parent/s wish to achieve. For example, favouring Ariel through the form of verbal praise, gifts of more monetary value, significantly more time and attention, and demonstrations of \"support\" (attending events or being present for important moments in her life) can serve two purposes.  \nThe first- it forms a bond of loyalty and connection from Ariel to your parents. Children want love (and *need* caregiver nurturing for survival, up until a certain age, where caregiver nurturing is then not required for survival, but is a major factor for well-being) from their parents, and to make them proud. Receiving favouritism for meeting a parent's expectations (even if it is favouritism for the purpose of abuse) will fulfil the need for care and love.  \nThe second purpose it can fulfil- exterting control and acting as punishment for siblings. When a favoured child is held up and given the care and love that their siblings are not receiving, it acts as a way to punish the non-favoured children. Kids aren't able to process or see the underlying motivations for *why* they aren't receiving the same love and care. Critical thinking isn't something we develop until later in our adolescence, and even then, mechanics of abuse and control are knowledge we have to learn on top of that to be able to untangle something like this. That's why it's so common for children to blame themselves when their parents fight, or get divorced.   \n\nFor the siblings, they are being neglected. They see their sibling being given all the love and care they have been desperately needing and wanting, and think that they've been neglected because they're not smart enough/good enough like the favoured sibling is- which can be reinforced by the parents telling the other siblings so with things like \"If only you worked as hard as (favoured sibling)\" or \"You're just not as talented/pretty/smart as (sibling)\".  \nFor the favoured sibling, they end up in a precarious situation. They are having their needs met, but now their relationship with their siblings is being damaged because of this. As they get older, they may be able to see the favouritism. But the issue is, there's often the element of control from the parents. The parents may have told the favoured sibling that they're special, that the other siblings are not as good/are bad/are lazy etc. to reinforce the control over them, and to remove doubt later on that may have come up when the favoured sibling begins to see the dynamics at play.  \nSo even though the favoured sibling might love their siblings, and it may hurt a lot to see what is happening, they also may be terrified of losing the love and care they have been getting by being the favourite. Being favoured also can create a very high expectation- though on the surface it looks as if the favoured sibling can do no wrong in the parent's eyes, and are always excused for their behaviour, there's always the risk of being cast out like the other siblings.  \nThat is where the punishment of the non-favoured siblings serves its secondary role. On top of being a way to maintain control over them, it also serves to maintain control over the favoured sibling. Seeing that their other siblings are treated differently (worse), believing it's because they're not \"meeting expectations\" of the parents, will cause a favoured child to strive to maintain high levels of perfectionism in order to remain \"worthy\" of the care and love they are receiving. The threat of losing that if they slip up, act \"like their siblings\", fail to meet the expectations, or in any way go against their parents, creates immense pressure, anxiety and fear in order to reinforce loyalty and power over them. It sets up the favoured sibling to be ostracised against their siblings, and on the side of their parents, usually long before they're even able to be aware of or able to process and see the behaviours and what they mean.  \n\nSo, that brings us to now. You rightfully do not have anything to do with your parents outside of remaining in contact with your younger siblings. You have been neglected, which is a form of abuse, since you were a child, by your parents.  \nYour sister perpetuates some of this abuse, because she also was abused, however it looked different and impacted her differently. Instead of neglect, she was groomed to be a tool in which to control and abuse the rest of you. She potentially was made very dependent on your parents and was prevented from growing into her own person. And even though she can see the favouritism, and how (to some extent) it impacts you, there's her own hurt and abuse in there that makes that really hard to come to terms with. Because in amongst trying to accept that, she has to then realise and process that the love and care she had (and needed, just as you and your siblings needed) was not given from a place of genuine love- it was given out of a place of control and abuse. And she then has to also realise she unintentionally has continued this abuse herself, and from a young age, was forced into participation in it.  \n\nIt doesn't make her behaviour okay, but I also think that this is not a simple situation of \"she is doing this because she is an asshole\". I think she has been groomed to be a conduit and conveyer of abuse of your parents, and that is a very hard, painful thing to work through and undo, and takes time, professional support, and effort.  \n\nYou don't have to be the one to get her to heal or get help either. You need to focus on healing your own trauma. Then you can see what you have leftover energy wise for your siblings.  \n\nNAH. The only assholes here are your parents. You were all children who have been abused, your sister was abused in a different way, and it's going to take time to heal. Best of luck.", "NTA whilst she may not have a say in if she is the favourite child...she does have a say in how it is recieved and tolerated in the family.
