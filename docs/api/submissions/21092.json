It's just a lot harder to maintain friendships when you don't see each other every day anymore. People go on different life paths and just may not be compatible anymore.

No the favoritism isn't her fault, but what is her fault is throwing it in the faces of two literal children.  A good, caring sister wouldn't have thrown in their faces that she's the favorite.  She would have tried to find a way to help them feel more important in some way, as you have.  What she has done to those children is not ok.

She *is* a victim; during crucial developmental periods, she dealt with the guilt of seeing her siblings treated poorly in comparison to her, and she\u2019s likely internalized horrible anxiety trying to keep their love. I doubt she was trying to make fun of you by citing what could be done differently; she was trying to cope with the cognitive dissonance of her situation by suggesting ways you could level the playing field, so to speak. She probably has few other sources of love and support because everyone can see she\u2019s got your parents, so she feels she has to love them and be able to trust them. \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for suggesting hobbies you could take up to earn similar love and support; she has to think she\u2019s doing something right, because otherwise her only consistent support network could toss her aside arbitrarily at any time.
