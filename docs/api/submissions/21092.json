I think it was more so that Ariel had already been out of high school for a year by that point. Unfortunately, no matter what, the average student will lose a lot of friends after graduating high school. I know me and my current friends did. \n\nIt isn't anyone's fault. It's just a lot harder to maintain friendships when you don't see each other every day anymore. People go on different life paths and just may not be compatible anymore. A lot of big life changes happen fast, and you just don't have the time to consistently keep in touch with everyone.

I understand she doesn't have the best reaction, but I'm struggling to think how she's the responsible one in this situation. \n\nShe recognizes favoritism to the point of being able to verbally acknowledge it. Ariel could say something such as \"You're right, it isn't fair that our parents are ignoring you\" or \"Our parents should have the same amount of interest/consideration for you since you're also their daughters.\" My parents are the biggest ones at fault because they choose to favor Ariel, and that's out of her control. What is in her control is rubbing it in our faces. Telling our 12 and 14-year-old sisters that it's their fault that our dad ignores them is a choice for Ariel.

Is she that used to giving nothing but getting everything?", "I was on the fence until I saw that she is 20, and treating a 12 and 14 year old this way.  That takes her into the AH territory.  No the favoritism isn't her fault, but what is her fault is throwing it in the faces of two literal children.  A good, caring sister wouldn't have thrown in their faces that she's the favorite.  She would have tried to find a way to help them feel more important in some way, as you have.  What she has done to those children is not ok.  Maybe you didn't handle the conversation right, but you're not wrong in what you said.  Should you have left her crying?  Maybe not, but at the same time, doing so might be the wake up call she needs to realize how she is hurting her sisters with her words, and behavior.\n\nThat said, I'm going to have to go with NTA here.", "NTA. At all. I was my parents favorite and it was obvious to even strangers. I was also better in sports and school than my brother and I went and completed college and got a high paying job while he dropped out and bounced around before finding himself.\n\n**But** the key difference here is that like Ariel, I acknowledged the favoritism, and *unlike Ariel*, I stood up for my brother and pushed back against it at every opportunity.\n\nMy family moved around a lot, and as a result, my brother and I are super close and always have been because even though I was our parent's favorite, my big brother was *my* favorite and that made me his favorite.\n\nAriel is a victim here, sure, but instead of standing against the ones being bad, she's been pushing you and your sisters down to lift herself up and that's **her fault**.\n\nEnjoy your close relationships with your sister and maybe Ariel will come around a little once she's out of the house and a little older, but you're under no obligation to be as close as you are with the other 2 sisters.", "NTA. It seems Ariel's real problem is not enough people came to her birthday and not enough money was spent on her. And when she complained you were too tired to deal and inadvertently grey rocked her.

That's my stance on victimhood is you're really only a victim until you start either A) continuing the cycle or B) weaponize it. Your sister weaponizes her status as the \"favourite\" and uses it to shit on your siblings and you, so she doesn't get to cry and play act all hurt. She knows why she's your parents favourite, and she should understand that her behaviour is why she's not yours or even a lot of peoples favourites if her parties are bringing in less people every year.\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised she didn't run crying to mommy and daddy about this.
