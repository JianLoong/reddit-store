It's just a lot harder to maintain friendships when you don't see each other every day anymore. People go on different life paths and just may not be compatible anymore.

No the favoritism isn't her fault, but what is her fault is throwing it in the faces of two literal children.  A good, caring sister wouldn't have thrown in their faces that she's the favorite.  She would have tried to find a way to help them feel more important in some way, as you have.  What she has done to those children is not ok.

She *is* a victim; during crucial developmental periods, she dealt with the guilt of seeing her siblings treated poorly in comparison to her, and she\u2019s likely internalized horrible anxiety trying to keep their love. I doubt she was trying to make fun of you by citing what could be done differently; she was trying to cope with the cognitive dissonance of her situation by suggesting ways you could level the playing field, so to speak. She probably has few other sources of love and support because everyone can see she\u2019s got your parents, so she feels she has to love them and be able to trust them. \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for suggesting hobbies you could take up to earn similar love and support; she has to think she\u2019s doing something right, because otherwise her only consistent support network could toss her aside arbitrarily at any time.

Also is good to read that you have a nice relation with the younger ones. With those parents and your sister is nice to know that they have a big sister they can rely on.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA .

You did good kid.Dont let them gaslight you", "Came to say this; the moment Ariel acknowledged the favoritism and made it seem like it was THEIR fault (instead of their parents) is what makes this a NTA.", "NTA - OP - Your parents are frankly terrible people, not because they favor one child, (which is actually quite common) but because they favor that child to the exclusion of all their other children. They have created a monster in their chosen one, and made sure their other daughters( and possibly the fourth) will need therapy in the future. \n\nIt's good that you can be there for your sisters in a way no one could be there for you. I do hope you have someone in your life that can offer you support. If it's viable I would suggest you consider therapy, because being emotionally abandoned by your parents can be traumatic.", "They named her after the little mermaid of course she thinks she's the main character", "And 12 is old enough to learn it's an AH move (it's old enough to know without help that those words would hurt. Unless she was completely emotionally unintelligent and said things like that often. But in that case I don't know how well extrovertedness would work.)", "I would see it as even stronger cause to teach her right. kids shouldnt be taught or encouraged to do things that will get them in trouble as an adult. As parenta are the one creating such enviroment, one of the sisters would have to step up in your scenario. So while it is understandable (ofc she is a child and they learn mostly from others and the surrounding), it is also understandable and not AH move to teach the right thing, tho differntly from how you would teach an adult a lesson ofc.\n\nAlso the dynamics would change if she were a child so same actions cant be compared for adults and kids. so it is a moot point ot discuss if she were a kid.", "Great story \ud83d\udc9c You just gave me another great example that morality and human kindness are still alive!

OP needs to read it. Everyone else is all \"dump your family\" but sometimes all it takes is some compassion and patience to fix things. It sucks that it's on OP to have to do that and agree they're NTA but it may be a more complicated situation as you pointed out.", "By far the most compassionate response. Thank you for articulating this.", "her sister is 20", "I\u2019m not so sure about your second point, what if Ariel was half her age? Age definitely plays a factor here.", "People pleasers do not taunt their little sisters about why their parents don't favour them. People pleasers try to please everyone not just people who favour them over others by definition.\n\nAriel is just mad OP tries to compensate for the sake of literal children. I am not from USA and I know Honour Roll is a big deal but Ariel and her parents can't be bothered because the girl's don't have hobbies. Children are not supposed to be exact replicas of their parents. Ariel is a grown up and choosing to be cruel to her sisters. OP is NTA.", "I had the ages mixed up and thought Ariel was the baby, but still wasn't feeling bad for her. Once I realized at the end I was wrong, made her even less sympathetic. Can't have it both ways. NTA.", "People usually put ages after the names, so I've been assuming the girl's 14!

There are many people still doing \u201cgrowing\u201d past the age of 20, many of whom have serious trauma caused by intergenerational cycles of poor parenting.

My sister is the golden child and for so many years I resented the heck outta her. Now I'm older and in therapy it's easy to understand that she has it just as hard: that's a thin and wobbly pedestal she's on, it must be really stressful having to live up to the parents expectations. However my sister can also be a HUGE bully like OP's using that to her advantage. It's an asshole thing to do, especially as OP is supporting their younger siblings.", "Yeah, but at 20 Ariel needs to know why she is being excluded - which is what OP explained - and why SHE needs to reflect on things and change how she treats her siblings. It's not up to her siblings to put up with bullying and nastiness and lack of respect just because she may be suffering too. That's just enabling the abused to become an abuser and it helps no-one, not even Ariel in the long run.", "This.", "Be there for them until you can get them out of there.", "They\u2019re right that it sucks to be the odd sibling out. They\u2019re just letting that sad fact override the reality, that Ariel is the odd one out because she treats the other siblings horribly. \n\nIf OP owes her anything, it\u2019s continuing to be honest about why they aren\u2019t close. Ariel could benefit from some hard reflection about her own behavior.", "So, you don't understand the abuse and victimization that golden children are also subject to? Their parents purposefully isolated Ariel from her siblings. Ariel has no support system, unlike OP and the two younger siblings having each other.", "Hopefully this is a learning moment for her and you can all repair your relationships.", "I would have done the same thing in both scenarios", "That is some crazy entitlement from Ariel to expect a present when you weren\u2019t invited to the party.

Add on years of hurt...\n\nOP is buy far not an AH. Could've swung it back \"You're the reason we have this relationship. If you didn't rub it in our faces how much better your relationship with mom & dad is + putting that relationship on us; We might actually have had a good relationship. You're mean to us so we don't have a good relationship.\" I don't think that'd be so bad but given she's 20 she can figure it out on her own.", "kids can absolutely be ass holes and sometimes they need to be reminded about reality so I'm gonna agree with the guy you replied too", "If a 12 year old is acting like a prick to me, they can't expect me to not reciprocate that energy. That's old enough where they shouldn't be acting like an asshole to their older sibling, and if they persist then they can kick rocks. If it was an 8 year old I would have empathy for them. 12 year old, hell no", "Good catch. Not only does she expect to be everyone's favorite, she expects everyone to celebrate her mediocrity. She's been failed by their parents, because the lack of presence (and presents) at her party also sounds like other people are tiring of her personality \"quirk\" of being mom and dad's favorite. It's become her sole claim in life.", "Oh, OP has written it the other way around - first age, then name. I was sure Ariel is 14 \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo she is 20 and bullying her younger siblings? Eff her. OP, NTA.", "Same \n\n\nFor some reason I thought she was the youngest lol", "I did the same thing and had to edit.", "Yes!! I love the first one!", "nah. She's old enough to understand that if she wants to reach an olive branch she'll have to stand up to her parent's favoritism, and openly denounce it in front of her younger siblings, and tell her parents that they shouldn't favor her. But she won't, because she clearly likes being the favorite, enough so that she rubs it into people's faces and never saw anything wrong with it, because she has no problem raking in benefits she doesn't deserve.", "It was fine to tell her how she felt, although she could\u2019ve been a bit kinder about it, I\u2019m just saying she may not want to write her sister off forever.", "There is a saying that is something like: \"every story has 3 sides, mine, yours and the truth\".", "So she should continue to let herself get treated like garbage just because they're related? Yeah that'll fix everything", "I don\u2019t think OP is an AH, I really think the AHs here are Ariel and the parents. I just think that age is a factor in the judgement- would you tell a 10 or 11 year old that you don\u2019t like them and you don\u2019t care about their life? Just saying that you don\u2019t have a good relationship and explaining why is different than saying you don\u2019t like them or care about their life and explaining why.", "They definitely can be! But that doesn\u2019t mean that telling someone that\u2019s 10 that you don\u2019t like them or care about their life is still an AH move. But because she *is* 20, OP is still NTA. I just think that age is a factor here.", "Half of Ariel\u2019s age would be 10- not 12. Sure they should probably know better at that point than to be an AH, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to tell them that you don\u2019t like them or care about their life. I do still think OP is NTA in this situation because Ariel 20, and not 10, though.", "Hi...I just wanted to pop onto the last comment you made to this. Yes everyone agrees with the fact it was a AH move BUTTT despite that Ariel has golden child syndrome... even being 20. You basically all need therapy. She needs to learn how to deal with her over inflated ego basically. She has been trained to accept this. My sister is a golden child. I was looked at as evil incarnate. I'm in therapy and after 5 years I've learned I'm not bad like I was taught. My golden child sister is not...her therapy consists of drinking too much shopping too much and moving every few years. Funny thing is she has bought AND SOLD the same home 5 times. Good luck.", "I literally can\u2019t even imagine a 20 year old being immature enough to bully her siblings that are SIX and EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER than her. \n\nIt makes me think of like a 9th grade bully harassing kindergarteners because it\u2019s much easier to bully someone that\u2019ll have a hard time defending themselves.. like children. Bet she doesn\u2019t bully people her own age / size. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine the hurt those little girls must feel after being ignored by their parents and then told it\u2019s their fault by their sister. The thing about being bullied though is that eventually you get tired of it, so Ariel better hope one of her sisters isn\u2019t hiding a mean right hook up their sleeves next time she gets mouthy.", "and even if they were a kid, such a blatant lack of empathy deserves a harsh response imo", "I thought they were 23 for some reason. And I still stand on what I said if you replace it with a 10 year old. I don't see what's wrong with telling a 10 year old that you don't care about them or what's going on their life if it's true.", "Exactly! Her parents are shitty and sounds like they neglect the rest of the siblings. At least emotionally. Ariel could easily show interest in her sisters but instead she makes them feel unworthy. Why would they want to be around some like that? You get what you give. OP NTA keep being there for your younger sisters.", " > she has bought AND SOLD the same home 5 times \n\nWtaf??!", "Maybe after multiple attempts of trying to address the issue, but for a first conversation about it I don\u2019t think so.", "Kids that age can be super clueless, I would give one a chance to learn and grow.", "You don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong telling a 5th grader that you don\u2019t like them or care about their life as an adult figure in their life?", "This is exactly what I\u2019m saying!", "No. Please tell me what's wrong with it", "Because it\u2019s psychologically damaging? A lot of kids at that age still aren\u2019t good at managing their emotions, and they look to the adults in their lives to learn how to do these things and deal with situations. A kid telling their siblings that they need to change to be liked by their parents needs to be talked to. There needs to be redirection, and an explanation on why it\u2019s wrong and how it affects those around them. They don\u2019t need to be told that they\u2019re disliked and that people don\u2019t care about the things in their life.", "They need to see that being a prick has consequences and stop. If you do what you suggest and baby them, they won't learn shit."]}
