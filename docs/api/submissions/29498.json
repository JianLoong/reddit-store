If they want to cut you out of their lives for such a petty little thing, good riddance.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Aside from the fact that it's tacky as hell to bring a freakin' cooler of boxed wine to a wedding that already has numerous cocktail options, there's also a liability issue to consider. I don't know what the laws are in Brazil, but many venues in the States and abroad have restrictions regarding who can provide/serve alcohol. I used to work in group sales for a resort in Cabo, and my boss got an inquiry from a wedding where they wanted to have open bottles of vodka and tequila on the tables during the reception so guests could pour on their own. Needless to say, he told the couple they'd need to look for another venue because of the potential liability of someone overserving themselves.", "or maybe bring a really good bottle and present it as a gift and offer first glass for them and couple?", "Providing wine is expensive, but providing cocktails is not? OP's brother is an asshole, don't get me wrong. It's not that he had to get by without alcohol (god forbid). No to the boxed wine, but your comment isn't the reason why.", "> Bringing box wine?

Was he going to punch a long straw into it like a juice box to be able to endure the horrors of a wineless reception?", "The wedding was in Brazil and there wine is not something common to serve at weddings. To include wine, we would significantly increase the price for the open bar, and we focus on what we wanted: my husband wanted beer and I wanted cocktails. We have paid for the whole wedding ourselves so while we were trying to please the guests, there were things that did not feel that we prioritzed ourselves.", "Also bringing outside wine when there is an open bar paid for? I don't think that is going to go over well with the venue/vendors and it could get the couple in trouble.", "Hey you! Yeah YOU....\n\nWhere's my pizza....\nLook at that it was just as effective.", "I know there was one about someone bringing McDonald\u2019s to his table.", "100000% \n\nThey are classy alcoholics", "Why didn\u2019t you just say bring the wine to the kitchen/bar and we\u2019ll keep it there for you? It just would have been so much easier.", "So you asked the question and got some responses and the first one you reply to is in defense of yourself and your decision.  Do you just want validation bc obviously, your wedding your day, box wine in a cooler under a table at a wedding is obviously trashy, you know you are going to overwhelming NTA votes.  But for exactly 2 years to the day of the event this has bothered you, and this AITA and the other 2 you wrote aren\u2019t going to give you the validation you need to move one.  I don\u2019t know what will but you\u2019ll probably figure it out.\n\nIt is unfortunate that your wedding led to the subsequent events.  If barely anyone drinks wine at a Brazilian wedding, a much better option would have been that their wedding present could be the wine supply.  Then BIL can give his toast, anyone who wants wine can have it, instead you got what you got.\n\nYour husband was kind of an asshole asking the family, especially if he phrased it the way you did.  Why didn\u2019t he ask random people on Reddit like you did? Or work colleagues? I\u2019m sure they were embarrassed and it was really none of the cousins business. What if the the cousin told your husband, wtf is wrong with you, box wine in a cooler under the table is a great idea?   Who cares what cousins opinion is, it\u2019s your wedding your choice, you make a decision on your own and stand by it, not gossip to the family about.", "Why would fewer people be drunk when beer and cocktails are being served too?", "To go along with this, depending on local liquor laws and/or the rental contract for the venue it might cause problems for the venue and/or the reception. \n\nNTA", "I had added to the post, but I had to remove it due to the character limit: I am a biggie fan of the thread and always lurk around, without commenting or posting anything. Usually, I tell the stories I read to my husband, and we comment about them between ourselves. Today, we were reminiscing about our wedding (mainly because of the anniversary), and my husband said it would be fun to read other people's take around the whole situation, so I made the post. \nAt the time of our wedding, I did not know about the thread, I just discovered it recently (like a year ago or so) through a podcast Reels that appeared on Instagram.\n\nI think what most upset me was the attitude, then anything else. As in, just informing me about it, rather than ask if it was okay, or try to find some alternative together. Like, i was planning a whole weddinf from distance and during COVID (at the time we were not even sure if itncould happen or not), and she just brought one more problem, without any consideration for us. Other people said about bringing flasks and whatnot, and that definitely would not have bothered me, but a 5 litres inside a cooler was just too much.\n\nTo your point, he talked to strangers too, but he  wanted some inside the family opinion. Also, we believed that if she really thought the way she was conducting things were fine, she would not be bothered in it being  replicated to others. \n\nI have never had much contact with my SIL, so genuinely, it is indifferent to me. I do think it bothers my husband though, not just the wine situation, but along their life, there were some situations that his sister behaved weirdly to say at least. He already tried to ask her many times to have a conversation and said that he wants to understand her line of thoughts and what he is doing wrong, but she is never willing to talk. He does go to therapy and every now and then he talks about their relationship. As for me,  I am willing to go for dinners and never even mention it happened, but I refuse to apologise, as I don't think I did anything wrong, and honestly I would have handled the situation exactly the same way."]}
