I called out my roomate for making plans for vacation assuming I would care for her 4 pets without asking. 2. 2 roommates said I was wrong and that because we are friends they shouldn't have to ask.

You are basically living with another family and that your friend has really helped you out.  These make boundaries kind of blurry.  Did they expect that you would do this when you moved in?  Do they think the pets are \"communal?\"  Do you pay under-market rent?  I think you need to ask yourself, do you want to be part of this \"family\" in this way - would it be cleaner with your friend if you moved out?  Could you do so financially?  Emotionally?  It's a tough situation but you clearly feel taken advantage of so these questions might need to be answered (for you).  Good luck!", "Fabulous idea!", "Thats a bad idea.\n\nOP is an adult.

They show they don't actually care about their animals when they don't actively consider whether they can find appropriate care for them while away.\n\n\nYears ago, I rented in a house with four other people. One day, I awoke to a note on the side door that explained this one roommate left last night for Australia, and was to be gone for three months. It also included a basic demand to care for their unruly dog while they were gone. \u201cWhat in the actual fuck?\u201c, we all thought. He didn't even have enough dog food for that amount of time, and expected us to buy it.\n\nThe other roommates and I decided together that we didn't want to do this, not that we even had the schedule for it. I ended up working out a deal with a local dog boarding facility to take his dog, with the expectation that he would pay the bill when he got back. Boy, was he fucking pissed when he got back lol. He expected us to pay the $4500 bill. The rest of us roommates ended up renting a new place without him, while he was gone lol", "NTA \n\nObviously", "Then the mom and brother can take care of the animals. You might want to go visit a friend or family for a few days while their care is being sorted out.", "Im not quite tho. I am 1 of the +3 on the lease. We moved in together on the same day. I just pay my room and food and put in for the wifi."]}
