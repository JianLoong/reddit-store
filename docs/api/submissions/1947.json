After barely being in your life at all he does not have the right to come back in and demand that you come and live with him and start calling him dad like you guys have been cool all along. Those kinds of things have to be earned. Your foster parents are in the right not to tell you what to do because they want this to be your decision and your decision only without any influence from them. And that is a very loving thing for them to do for you", "NTA: he and his entire family abandoned you and put you into the potentially very dangerous foster system (although sounds like you lucked out) and then he gets out of prison and wants to be dad at the age of 15?

He is a literal stranger. Perhaps he should have offered to keep meeting you until you were comfortable to even entertain the idea, but 7 years with a (clearly supportive) foster family seems to be a much more comfortable environment for you and that\u2019s ok. \n\nScrew what other people are saying, it\u2019s a very hard situation you find yourself in and easy for them to judge you from the outer.", "NTA. Biology doesn\u2019t make you a dad. You have no relationship with the man. But it sounds like you have a real meaningful relationship with your foster family.

The right decision is the one you chose following your heart, and it seems you did chose already. No matter what other people say, the decision is yours to take and yours only. Also it's a red flag that your biological dad gets angry when you refuse to live with him, and i can't stress this enough. Had he really changed, he would accept to go to your own rhythm and not try to force you. It also gives an idea of how you would be treated if he gets angry like that, sounds short tempered and i don't know why he went to jail but it sounds quite scary to imagine maybe he went because he got violent toward someone. \n\nAnyway op, NTA.

Your foster family sound lovely and supportive, you're very lucky to have such great people in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour bio dad (your real dad is the one that was actually there for you) isn't automatically owed a second chance. He needs to earn that and even then you can decide it's not enough.\n\nWhat he is instead doing is the opposite of that. Demanding the chance and then getting angry when it isn't handed to him with no effort on his part. Not exactly encouraging that he would do well with the chance if it was given is it.\n\nYour foster family aren't telling you if it is the right or wrong decision because they don't want to put pressure on you one way or the other and want to be able to support you whatever you decide.", "NTA. Just because someone is a sperm donor doesn\u2019t make them a father.  You owe him nothing.", "Wow, things are *different* where you are. In the UK, Social Services have a duty to promote contact, which has to be formally reviewed every year at the most (which would normally involve them contacting your family). And you'd have a social worker, who you could talk to about this. If a dad who'd disappeared for seven years suddenly turned up, there'd be a plan for gradual re-introduction of contact. If he wanted to take care of you, there'd be a lot of support (for you and him), formal plans, consulting you, and enabling you to take each step at a time. You'd be expected to progress to day visits then staying with him overnight before making any decisions about whether you wanted to live with him (and it would be highly unlikely to get that far if you objected strongly enough).\n\nGiven the total lack of any of this in your message, I'm inclined to call your CPS and government the AHs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nothing you have done here is wrong or bad or disappointing in any way.\n\nYour father, on the other hand, has let you down repeatedly. A sensible grown up would get in contact with their estranged child, knowing that just getting a \"yes I'd like to see you\" would be a victory in itself. A loving but distant parent would know that after so many years absence a relationship has to be built up slowly and carefully, and would let you set the pace for that. They would accept that you may never have a parent-child bond, but would be happy to just be allowed some time and space in your life.\n\nA selfish parent would demand and expect an instantaneous bond. And only a selfish parent would expect you to drop a loving and safe foster family in their favour after one short meeting. You don't know him. If any other teenager announced they were going to go and live with a strange man they'd just met, there would be shock and outrage, and questions about safeguarding. Just because his sperm made you does not make those concerns less valid.\n\nI don't know what your birth father's motivation is for all this. Maybe he assumed the foster system had been so cruel to you that he could swoop in and \"save\" you and be the hero. Maybe he checked out because he never wanted a baby but thinks a teenager will be easier to manage (lol). Maybe he thinks he'll get some kind of financial help from somewhere if he takes back his birth child.\n\nWhatever his motivation, none of this is your fault. You have got a family that cares for you, and when people care about you then they worry about you. That doesn't mean you should feel guilty for what has happened.

It's not for anyone else to decide.", "Nta", "NTA.  But it is not all or nothing.  You can set boundaries.  You can ask for help doing it.  You need to let him know that he is a stranger that you don't yet trust.  Of course you don't want to immediately move in with him!  It is okay to point out that he wasn't in jail when your mom died.  That he failed you as a father before jail, and you would appreciate taking it slow and getting to know each other.  If you lose your place in the good foster home where you are safe and loved, you might not be so lucky next time.  Tell him that.  Visits, texts, calls.

Otherwise, he would be more understanding of your hesitation to move in with him and he wouldn't feel the need tell everyone in town about your not wanting to. \nStick with your decision. If other people give you crap about it, tell them that if he really cared about you, he would you to be where you felt safe happy. That's where you are with the people you know have been with. Not with someone one who tries to force themselves into your life without actually taking the time get to you or the family you that has been all you've known for years.", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone, anything. You said yourself he didn\u2019t go until 2 years after your mom passed, and therefore he could\u2019ve taken you had he wanted. \n\nI really like that your foster family are being so supportive of you and your decision. I\u2019d continue to listen to that gut instinct saying stay away, and move on with your life OP.", "NTA and I salute you for the maturity and strength you are showing.", "NTA - you Decide what relationship you are prepared to have. Right now you are saying no thanks. He has to accept it. All the people gaslighting you did not step up when you went into foster care are irrelevant to the decision.", "Nta", "He shouldn\u2019t be getting angry. At all. \n\nTotally NTA. Protect yourself and the ones you love.", "or maybe bio dad is  hoping to get the $$ foster care pays for care of the child?", "NTA! If your dad want's you to live with him, then he should *get to know you first.* He could totally be a good person and a good father now, but you don't know that. Your Foster family doesn't know that. Get to know him, see if he's actually ready to care for you, and then decide.", "NTA. No way are you TA. Your dad is essentially a stranger and your foster family is your family. To think you would abandon your family to live with a stranger who just got out of jail is ridiculous. Your foster family sounds awesome and you\u2019re lucky to have them.", "Everytime a son/daughter refuses to live with a disfunctional parent, the son/daughter is trash.\nI\u2019ve been there, believe me, you did the right choice. Your mental health is way more important than someone who thinks has any right to be a parent only because you share half dna with them\n\nNTA!", "NTA. You have a really good supportive foster family and that\u2019s important for you in your life. You need the stability. Dad can\u2019t just pop in whenever he feels like it to take on the role. It doesn\u2019t work like that. It is your decision. And your dad has to accept the fact that you don\u2019t want to live with him.", "NTA - my brain immediately went to money.  It sounds like you are in the US.  If your Mom worked, then you would be eligible to receive a monthly Social Security Check.  If you Dad worked before he went to jail, Social Security on his earnings as well.   \n\nIf it's another country, then I'm not sure how that works, but often an orphan/foster kid would mean payments from the government.  If you Dad was in jail, he would not have been able to collect any benefits for you.  In the US, you are not able to have any income as long as you are in jail.   Now that he's out, you still have several years of monthly payments coming in which I believe he's after.", "NTA also you haven't let your parents and family down, but you've been let down by all your biological family, and the gossips. Stay strong, be loyal, and this will all blow over in time. He was gone for 13 years, it's going to take a lot more than a couple of hours to make any inroads towards a relationship with you. Somehow I don't see him hanging around for long.", "People always have this nuts notion that being biologically tied to someone is this Hallmark Moment--that you meet your \"real\" Dad or Mum, you instantly bond, angels sing somewhere, etc. Trust me--*that's not what happens*. If you grow up with people,  related or not, bonding of some kind happens (in remotely normal environs, admittedly). You have zero relationship with this guy. No emotional bonds. Nothing that ties you to him.  *He's a sperm donor, that's it.*\n\nDon't let that dictate what works for you.  I tried to \"bond\" with my biological dad, 20-30 years later and you know what? It was more work than it was worth; he was as selfish and self-absorbed, etc. then as he was when he thought I wasn't worth much at 3.  Just...if you're happy (enough) with your Fosters, stay there. Trust me on this and you are NTA.  What other people think--that's their business, not yours and you should NOT care.", "Nta", "You didn\u2019t let them down. This is all on your bio dad. Not you. This isn\u2019t your burden. It\u2019s your bio dad\u2019s burden. He\u2019s the home wrecker here.", "Putting your dad aside (he has no right to demand **anything** of you and you are NTA in any way), reading your post made me really happy. Our foster care system has so many serious issues and heartbreaks, but you and your loved ones became family thanks to that same system, and it truly sounds like all of your lives have been enriched as a result. You are a strong young man, and your **real** family (foster fam) sounds awesome too. \n\nPlease try not to worry about the town talking to/about your family. I guarantee your parents would choose having you in their home and family every single time, regardless of what your bio fam says or how awkward they make it. You have the family you deserve by your side; everyone else can go fly a kite! As a last thought, please consider what's best for your mental health before meeting with bio dad again. You don't owe him anything, and it's okay to put yourself first and avoid him if that's what you decide you want.", "> The town gossips will eventually move on, when something new to gossip about comes up\n\nPerhaps I am going to the dark side... maybe one could speed up the process by starting juicy rumors about the ringleaders of this inbred assholery. You can set them off feeding on each other.", "Your not judging him on his past you judging him on his behaviour now! NTA", "NTA. If any future visits with your bio-father happen, they need to be scheduled through your CPS case worker and professionally supervised - and you have every right to request that of your CPS case worker. Doesn\u2019t sound like the visits so far have been professionally supervised or that your case worker has even been involved. You also have every right to tell your case worker you don\u2019t want visits with him but it\u2019s past time to get your case worker involved in this situation. \n\nWith your bio-father seeking his right to reunification, I have one more piece of advice - if you\u2019re in the US (sounds like you are) and don\u2019t have a guardian ad litem assigned to your CPS case, request one; it would probably have to be at the next court hearing. Don\u2019t settle for a CASA; a GAL will be much more effective in this situation.", "NTA...and you're lucky to have been placed with such great people.", "I thought about this as well. It's likely the foster family is getting money for taking care of OP. If OP lived with dad there's survivor benefits that would be available for the care of OP. What's the real motive? I would ease into a relationship. OP's bio Dad sounds weird"]}
