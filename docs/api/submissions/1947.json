Oh, and let\u2019s not forget where he\u2019s been\u2026over my dead body would a 15 year old in my care move in with a complete stranger who just got out of jail.\n\nYou need to get to know him before you make life altering decisions around him. If he can\u2019t even get that into his head, this might not go well. You don\u2019t have to see him, have contact with him, nothing you don\u2019t feel 100% comfortable with.\n\nIt\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business! The people in your town have zero right to any opinion on your life.", "No baby, you\u2019re NTA. Be where you are loved and supported.", "NTA. After barely being in your life at all he does not have the right to come back in and demand that you come and live with him and start calling him dad like you guys have been cool all along. Those kinds of things have to be earned. Your foster parents are in the right not to tell you what to do because they want this to be your decision and your decision only without any influence from them. And that is a very loving thing for them to do for you", "NTA: he and his entire family abandoned you and put you into the potentially very dangerous foster system (although sounds like you lucked out) and then he gets out of prison and wants to be dad at the age of 15? Any one with a penis and testicles can be a sperm donor, but you need to *earn* being dad. He hasn't even come close to earning it.", "NTA\n\nFirstly I\u2019m sorry about your mom and just this situation in general, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nBut you have every right to not want to go with your bio dad. He is a literal stranger. Perhaps he should have offered to keep meeting you until you were comfortable to even entertain the idea, but 7 years with a (clearly supportive) foster family seems to be a much more comfortable environment for you and that\u2019s ok. \n\nScrew what other people are saying, it\u2019s a very hard situation you find yourself in and easy for them to judge you from the outer.", "NTA. Biology doesn\u2019t make you a dad. You have no relationship with the man. But it sounds like you have a real meaningful relationship with your foster family.  Your foster family sounds like they already are a part of your forever family group so stay with them. Screw all the outside noise.", "Op they are not telling you if it's the right or wrong decision because there is no right or wrong decision. The right decision is the one you chose following your heart, and it seems you did chose already. No matter what other people say, the decision is yours to take and yours only. Also it's a red flag that your biological dad gets angry when you refuse to live with him, and i can't stress this enough. Had he really changed, he would accept to go to your own rhythm and not try to force you. It also gives an idea of how you would be treated if he gets angry like that, sounds short tempered and i don't know why he went to jail but it sounds quite scary to imagine maybe he went because he got violent toward someone. \n\nAnyway op, NTA. Let others talk. Follow your heart, the decision you take will be the good one.", "NTA, imagine calling someone wh", "NTA...I'm glad you have a supportive family. Your birth father needs to work on establishing a friendship with you. He is clearly not ready to be a parent.", "NTA. He didn't want anything to do with you for the first 15 years of your life, and neither did his family. This man is not your dad, just your biological father, he is not entitled to anything and has no right whatsoever to claim his fatherhood after all this time. It seems that your foster family is amazing and your parents really understanding, which is great. Also, you've only known him for 6 months and he's already shown his true colors: an angry manipulative AH. Don't be afraid to go NC with him.", "NTA\n\nHow can people be upset with you and say you're not giving him a chance?!\n\nWhy would you want to go and live with a man you barely know, leaving behind a family who has loved and cared for you for 7 years! Not to mention that he's been in prison for 11 years!!!\n\nIt's amazing how people feel they are entitled to air their opinions about things that don't involve or concern them.\n\nIf you'd like to continue a relationship with your bio father, that's great, but don't let anyone make you feel pressured to do something you don't want. Your foster family sound lovely and supportive, you're very lucky to have such great people in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour bio dad (your real dad is the one that was actually there for you) isn't automatically owed a second chance. He needs to earn that and even then you can decide it's not enough.\n\nWhat he is instead doing is the opposite of that. Demanding the chance and then getting angry when it isn't handed to him with no effort on his part. Not exactly encouraging that he would do well with the chance if it was given is it.\n\nYour foster family aren't telling you if it is the right or wrong decision because they don't want to put pressure on you one way or the other and want to be able to support you whatever you decide.", "NTA. Just because someone is a sperm donor doesn\u2019t make them a father.  You owe him nothing.", "Wow, things are *different* where you are. In the UK, Social Services have a duty to promote contact, which has to be formally reviewed every year at the most (which would normally involve them contacting your family). And you'd have a social worker, who you could talk to about this. If a dad who'd disappeared for seven years suddenly turned up, there'd be a plan for gradual re-introduction of contact. If he wanted to take care of you, there'd be a lot of support (for you and him), formal plans, consulting you, and enabling you to take each step at a time. You'd be expected to progress to day visits then staying with him overnight before making any decisions about whether you wanted to live with him (and it would be highly unlikely to get that far if you objected strongly enough).\n\nGiven the total lack of any of this in your message, I'm inclined to call your CPS and government the AHs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Beware of such attempts because he is probably trying to look good to others and is not really concerned about what you want.

Your foster family sounds awesome, and this definitely sounds like a case where your dad and other people are just trying to claim that blood is thicker than water. But your foster family are the ones who were and are actually there for you, I don\u2019t understand what people want you to do? Just drop these people that have raised you for the past 7 years? I think you\u2019ve handled yourself very well and the fact you feel bad about this and what other people are saying shows you have great character. All the best OP, hope it works out well for you", "Sweetheart, I want to make one thing VERY clear to you. You have NOT let your foster family down. Nothing you have done here is wrong or bad or disappointing in any way.\n\nYour father, on the other hand, has let you down repeatedly. A sensible grown up would get in contact with their estranged child, knowing that just getting a \"yes I'd like to see you\" would be a victory in itself. A loving but distant parent would know that after so many years absence a relationship has to be built up slowly and carefully, and would let you set the pace for that. They would accept that you may never have a parent-child bond, but would be happy to just be allowed some time and space in your life.\n\nA selfish parent would demand and expect an instantaneous bond. And only a selfish parent would expect you to drop a loving and safe foster family in their favour after one short meeting. You don't know him. If any other teenager announced they were going to go and live with a strange man they'd just met, there would be shock and outrage, and questions about safeguarding. Just because his sperm made you does not make those concerns less valid.\n\nI don't know what your birth father's motivation is for all this. Maybe he assumed the foster system had been so cruel to you that he could swoop in and \"save\" you and be the hero. Maybe he checked out because he never wanted a baby but thinks a teenager will be easier to manage (lol). Maybe he thinks he'll get some kind of financial help from somewhere if he takes back his birth child.\n\nWhatever his motivation, none of this is your fault. You have got a family that cares for you, and when people care about you then they worry about you. That doesn't mean you should feel guilty for what has happened. This is entirely on your birth father, not you."]}
