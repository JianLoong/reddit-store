After barely being in your life at all he does not have the right to come back in and demand that you come and live with him and start calling him dad like you guys have been cool all along. Those kinds of things have to be earned. Your foster parents are in the right not to tell you what to do because they want this to be your decision and your decision only without any influence from them. And that is a very loving thing for them to do for you", "NTA: he and his entire family abandoned you and put you into the potentially very dangerous foster system (although sounds like you lucked out) and then he gets out of prison and wants to be dad at the age of 15?

He is a literal stranger. Perhaps he should have offered to keep meeting you until you were comfortable to even entertain the idea, but 7 years with a (clearly supportive) foster family seems to be a much more comfortable environment for you and that\u2019s ok. \n\nScrew what other people are saying, it\u2019s a very hard situation you find yourself in and easy for them to judge you from the outer.", "NTA. Biology doesn\u2019t make you a dad. You have no relationship with the man. But it sounds like you have a real meaningful relationship with your foster family.  Your foster family sounds like they already are a part of your forever family group so stay with them.

The right decision is the one you chose following your heart, and it seems you did chose already. No matter what other people say, the decision is yours to take and yours only. Also it's a red flag that your biological dad gets angry when you refuse to live with him, and i can't stress this enough. Had he really changed, he would accept to go to your own rhythm and not try to force you. It also gives an idea of how you would be treated if he gets angry like that, sounds short tempered and i don't know why he went to jail but it sounds quite scary to imagine maybe he went because he got violent toward someone. \n\nAnyway op, NTA.

Your foster family sound lovely and supportive, you're very lucky to have such great people in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour bio dad (your real dad is the one that was actually there for you) isn't automatically owed a second chance. He needs to earn that and even then you can decide it's not enough.\n\nWhat he is instead doing is the opposite of that. Demanding the chance and then getting angry when it isn't handed to him with no effort on his part. Not exactly encouraging that he would do well with the chance if it was given is it.\n\nYour foster family aren't telling you if it is the right or wrong decision because they don't want to put pressure on you one way or the other and want to be able to support you whatever you decide.", "NTA. Just because someone is a sperm donor doesn\u2019t make them a father.  You owe him nothing.", "Wow, things are *different* where you are. In the UK, Social Services have a duty to promote contact, which has to be formally reviewed every year at the most (which would normally involve them contacting your family). And you'd have a social worker, who you could talk to about this. If a dad who'd disappeared for seven years suddenly turned up, there'd be a plan for gradual re-introduction of contact. If he wanted to take care of you, there'd be a lot of support (for you and him), formal plans, consulting you, and enabling you to take each step at a time. You'd be expected to progress to day visits then staying with him overnight before making any decisions about whether you wanted to live with him (and it would be highly unlikely to get that far if you objected strongly enough).\n\nGiven the total lack of any of this in your message, I'm inclined to call your CPS and government the AHs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nothing you have done here is wrong or bad or disappointing in any way.\n\nYour father, on the other hand, has let you down repeatedly. A sensible grown up would get in contact with their estranged child, knowing that just getting a \"yes I'd like to see you\" would be a victory in itself. A loving but distant parent would know that after so many years absence a relationship has to be built up slowly and carefully, and would let you set the pace for that. They would accept that you may never have a parent-child bond, but would be happy to just be allowed some time and space in your life.\n\nA selfish parent would demand and expect an instantaneous bond. And only a selfish parent would expect you to drop a loving and safe foster family in their favour after one short meeting. You don't know him. If any other teenager announced they were going to go and live with a strange man they'd just met, there would be shock and outrage, and questions about safeguarding. Just because his sperm made you does not make those concerns less valid.\n\nI don't know what your birth father's motivation is for all this. Maybe he assumed the foster system had been so cruel to you that he could swoop in and \"save\" you and be the hero. Maybe he checked out because he never wanted a baby but thinks a teenager will be easier to manage (lol). Maybe he thinks he'll get some kind of financial help from somewhere if he takes back his birth child.\n\nWhatever his motivation, none of this is your fault. You have got a family that cares for you, and when people care about you then they worry about you. That doesn't mean you should feel guilty for what has happened.

Even from prison if he had wanted to contact you, I am pretty sure he could have (letter?), and as you said he left even before he was in prison so clearly you were not that important to him.

The fact that he even gets angry about you not wanting to live with a literal stranger out of nowhere is alarming in itself.", "You are NTA. \n\nBut don't come looking for someone to tell you if it is right or wrong.

It's not for anyone else to decide.", "Nta", "NTA.  But it is not all or nothing.  You can set boundaries.  You can ask for help doing it.  You need to let him know that he is a stranger that you don't yet trust.  Of course you don't want to immediately move in with him!  It is okay to point out that he wasn't in jail when your mom died.  That he failed you as a father before jail, and you would appreciate taking it slow and getting to know each other.  If you lose your place in the good foster home where you are safe and loved, you might not be so lucky next time.  Tell him that.  Visits, texts, calls.  If he wants a relationship,  that's how things start.  You can send him an email, you can ask one of your foster parents to accompany you and assist you in this difficult talk.  All of your life people will ask for things they shouldn't.  Learning how to say no, how to suggest something reasonable, how to communicate,  is very very important.   Might as well start now.
