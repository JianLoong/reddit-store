{"id": 15897, "submission_id": "131skai", "title": "AITA for buying a house?", "selftext": "My (35M) girlfriend (30F) suggested I ask other people what they think about this situation.\n\nWe've been dating for a bit over a year now and things are going overall great. Our personalities are complimentary, we think the same way about a lot of things, but not everything because that would be boring, we love each other and are committed to each other, and recently started talking about making a life together.  We don't live together but have planned on it.\n\nRecently I came into some money and decided it would be smart to buy a house. We live in a city with a real estate market that's still extremely competitive and never really slows down that much. I saw a really nice house on the market for $425k, I put in an offer for $515k, waived appraisal, waived inspection - and came in fifth out of eleven bids. I put in other offers on other houses which I thought were strong but reasonable and lost them all. The local subreddit regularly has posts from people trying to navigate this market and finding themselves shut out.\n\nMy realtor sent me a link to this one that had gone on the market, been sold in 2 days, and then financing from the buyer fell through so it was back on. It was the week before Easter, a lot of realtors and buyers were taking that week off, a lot of properties were listed but not showing until the following week, just a generally slow time. The stars aligned and I put in an offer at asking price without many concessions and won. This place is on the low side of my budget which means that there is plenty of money left over to decorate and design it and make it really nice.\n\nBut, I did not involve my girlfriend a lot in the buying process. It's kind of awkward to navigate - we're not married, it's my money, but I would like to live there with her and there's no real playbook on how to navigate this very millennial situation. She came with me to look at some houses which I didn't end up making offers on, and when I let her know I was going to go look at this one she said \"I'm curious about it\" but didn't really indicate she wanted to see it.\n\nWhen I told her that I won the offer, she started crying because she wasn't happy about the house. The listing pictures weren't the best. It's very close to the city but it's over a bridge with a 35 cent toll. I was hoping for a hug around the neck and someone to share my happiness. Since then, things have been kind of rocky. I've got this huge exciting thing happening and I feel like I can barely talk about it with her. She can't get over that I made this decision on my own.\n\nYes, I could have been more thoughtful and I should have involved her more in the process. I solely chose the place we both may be living for the next 2 - 5 years. The result of my actions is that we have secure shelter with the expenses taken care of, as well as a good budget to design and decorate it and fill it with the things we love most.

Let\u2019s look at the facts:\n\n- y\u2019all don\u2019t live together\n- y\u2019all been together for just a year\n- she\u2019s not contributing to the down payment\n\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to share finances and are assuming 100% of the risk here. You\u2019re very early in your relationship. Taking her opinion into consideration is nice but why would you buy a house she also wants? God forbid you breakup  and now it\u2019s a reminder of things past. It\u2019s your money and thus your home, it should be your preference. You\u2019re not an asshole for looking out for your interests - you\u2019re smart. \n\nMy boyfriend bought a home 2 months after we started dating. I walked 5 homes with him. There was one I liked better but told him it was his choice. I didn\u2019t want to be involved in such a big decision when we were so new. It\u2019s been 2 years now and I just moved in. He\u2019s always told people he appreciated how respectful of his privacy and space I was during the process. Your girlfriend needs to adjust her priorities here.", "NTA - Been there... in the g/f position. And my response was- it's your money... I'm more than happy to check out the places with you but ultimately, the decision is yours. My name wasn't on the deed and as much as I hoped we stayed together, the future isn't set in stone. For what it's worth, when we got married 4 years later- we sold the house and picked a new home together to start our family.", "NTA. In my opinion, as you said, it's your money, your investment, she'd only be moving in. It is likely if you split up that she'd just move out. What's the issue? It would be a different story if the money belonged to you both. But it doesn't so why is she mad?", "Info: How solid were your plans to move in together? Did you set a date and confirm these plans, or did you just casually discuss living together?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis probably not about the house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory time: years ago, I had a boyfriend of about 2 years. he had his own house, I lived in an apartment. We had keys to each others' places, had clothes/toothbrushes there, etc. We loved each other, but had never talked about a long term future. I bought a house. He broke up shortly after. Looking back, I think he took me buying a house as a sign that I had no long-term intentions with him, it played into his insecurities, and he moved on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou buying a house without involving her may be causing her to feel that you are dating, not in a relationship going anywhere long term. She may feel like an accessory, not a partner. You need to think about what you both want and where the relationship is going to get through this.", "NTA\n\nA house isn\u2019t just a house anymore, it\u2019s a financial investment. Get one now before it becomes even harder.\n\nAbsolute worst case, later on you could try to rent it out and get another one. I kinda see this as comparable to if she saw your stock portfolio and got upset that you invested in stocks she doesn\u2019t like.\n\nMy younger sister was in this situation just a bit ago (she\u2019d been dating her boyfriend 2+ years at that point) and sure she visited places with him, but she was very understanding that it was his money, and his decision. That being said she is planning to live in an apartment with her friends for at least another year, so maybe don\u2019t be surprised if your girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to move in right away.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not married. It\u2019s your money. You don\u2019t live together now. Why is it that she thinks she gets a say at all?\n\nShe\u2019s being unreasonable.", "Wait wait wait. She's having a sulk because her boyfriend is financially secure enough to buy a house, that she doesn't have to financially contribute anything too, AND he wants her to move in? \n\nIt's your money. It's not been left jointly, you're not married. Buy the house you want to buy, what if you guys can't make it work you'll be stuck with a house that was you're second choice.\n\nNTA.", "NAH - While I don't think either of you are AHs, this is going to create problems in your relationship.  I would classify this as a miscommunication, but a big one.", "NAH\n\n\u22481 year is a difficult amount of dating for this question. \n\n<< 1 year, nothing to do with her. \n\n>> 1 year, absolutely to do with her.\n\nI'm going NAH.  You needed to act and you aren't married or engaged. Then again her input/needs/feelings were ignored and she probably feels \"temporary\" and insecure.", "NAH. However, you need to be cognizant of the dynamics if she moves in and starts paying rent. She might resent paying for your equity, even if its a good deal. The biggest thing, imo, is you should plan on buying a house together after you get married, so it feels like a home to you both.", "NTA. You're going to let her live in your house rent free and pay to decorate how she likes and she's complaining about a 35 cent toll?\n\nJust tell her she's under no obligation to live there with you. Problem solved.", "NTA - It\u2019s your money and your house. You\u2019ve only been dating for over a year, that\u2019s not enough to make that kind of decision together especially when it\u2019s not even something you are purchasing together !", "Info: you are buying alone? She isn't putting anything into this? Not on any paperwork or anything? \n\nIf so, NTA. It's your house. Although, she decides if she wants to live there obviously. But she can't demand a say, she can have opinions and let you know them. But it's ultimately your decision.", "NAH.\n\nYou were doing the best you could in an insanely competitive market situation where speed was of the essence. But ultimately you were buying a house for yourself with the hopes that your gf would live there down the road.\n\nShe, understandably, might feel a bit upset that the house you ended up with didn't really suit her aesthetic or location-wise, given that she expects to move in down the road. \n\nIf you guys were planning to buy the house together or move in together right away, my judgment might be different. But it sounds like this is a down-the-road thing. So ultimately, the decision was entirely up to you, and it's okay for her to be a bit disappointed.", "NTA \n\n1. She declined to look at the place when given the choice. \n2. It sounds like you're providing a place to live that is costing her nothing.\n3. You had to move quickly.\n\nCould you have done a better job of keeping her in the loop? Sure. Since you're going to be making upgrades/changes, and you won't be under the gun, make sure to take her input into account.", "Considering how competitive the real estate market is, if she wanted a say in it, she should have been more proactive in the buying process. She has no right to be whining after the fact when she has no skin in the game. As a compromise, she can have a say in the remodeling If you guys are planning to stay together.", "NTA, she\u2019s getting a little ahead of herself.  There is no lifelong commitment here.  She could break up with you tomorrow and you\u2019d be stuck owning a home you didn\u2019t like but she did.", "It sounds like you both are thinking this relationship is a long term one, like a forever one. Is that correct? You said you've been talking about making a life together.\n\nIf you were both on the same page that you're that serious about each other, she should have known how serious you were about the house, because it sounds like you just chose where she's going to live for the next five years if you stay together. That's a big choice being ripped out of someone's hands. Regardless of who has more money, choosing where to live is a big decision and big decisions are together decisions. If she loved the house, it may have gone better, but maybe not. Together you will make loads of decisions together. The conversation you started about making a life together, should have continued and she should have been included.\n\nI would apologize and let her know she should have been included in the decision of where she lives. Listen to her, even if it's difficult, make her feel heard and understood. Maybe she gets to pick the next house without a peep from you? Or maybe you both learn from the situation, grow the communication, and hopefully your relationship can overcome this and get even better.\n\nI know this works differently for different relationships. I think people in a relationship should each have their own money, in addition to a joint that pays for common things. Then they can buy things without asking and have some autonomy. Those things though are like clothes, games, gifts, hobby stuff. Housing is a together thing. You each bring valuable thoughts and considerations to the table and they should be heard and understood.\n\nYou probably hate to hear it, in this situation, YTA.\nThat doesn't mean it can't be repaired. Work with your girlfriend to repair the hurt and build that life together that you both want.", "NTA, you\u2019re not married or engaged and you bought the house on your own in a crazy market. So it was your decision. But moving forward, if you want her to live there with you, make that very clear and make her an equal partner in helping to decorate, pick furniture, etc. She may just be feeling a little shut out right now.", "NTA", "NTA you all have only been together a year and you don't mention that you all have even discussed marriage. I think it's completely your decision to make and it was nice that you included her on part of the process. I would have a completely different opinion if you all had been together longer or were engaged. I think your GF thinks this means you're not as commited to her as she thought you were.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money you\u2019re the 1 buying the house she\u2019s not contributing so why does that give her any say in it?! If she doesn\u2019t like it she doesn\u2019t have to live there with you. Congratulations on buying a house.", "NAH. I've been the girlfriend in this situation before where my boyfriend bought a house with his friend with the expectation that I live there and pay rent. I went along with it and I would break up with someone before doing that again. Nothing killed the partnership feeling more than feeling like decisions as big as where I would be living were being made for me. \n\nYou're not an asshole but you're not a good partner either. You could have at least waited until it felt more comfortable making these decisions with your GF even if it was your house.", "NTA - It was your money and you are allowed to do with it what you want. However, if you see a real future with this girl, and want to live in this house with her, you may want to let her have a few design choices. Nothing major, but a few things that make it feel more like hers too. Dave Ramsey likes to say single men who buy a house, often resell it once a wife gets involved. If you are open to selling it in 5 or 6 years, maybe let her know that as well, so you can pick something that feels like home to both of you. But not married, your money NTA.", "NTA, you're not engaged or living together and she's not putting anything into it. Not sure how it's any different to if you already owned the house when you started dating.\n\nYes you want to live with her and appreciate her opinion but this is more a step on the ladder than forever home I imagine. Also her saying she's curious does not amount to I don't like it. You're not psychic. She knew you were looking and going to look at this property, if she had real feelings about it she should have used her adult words.", "I would not let her move in.  Absolutely serious.\n\nNot as a punishment, but because of her odd feeling she should have some control over what is strictly your decision.  When you break up (sorry, but very likely) you might find she is hard to remove.\n\nAlso, NTA", "NTA,  get a prenup.", "NTA. \n\nYou've only been together for almost a year and she already wants to move in with you? Into a house that you paid 100% with your OWN money? And god forbid you using 100% of YOUR money to design YOUR house that YOU bought with YOUR money?\n\n\nI am sorry but she is a walking red flag. Don't let her move in with you, please.\n\nOnly a year together and she already shows off her materialistic side. That would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA - Right now, corporations, many of them overseas, are buying up properties in cities all over the US. You have to jump fast to beat them. I understand how she feels, but this is not a normal situation and I don't blame you for snatching what you can get.", "NTA", "NTA. Not her house not her money. If she doesn't like it, she can move. Or revisit the issue after a few years.  Only dating a little over a year. Deal is done for now,", "If you aren't married NTA. But depending on how serious you are/if you want to get married it's not like her opinion should mean nothing either? (assuming she would live there too, which maybe wouldn't be the case? Maybe if you married you'd buy a house together and sell this one, who knows.)\n\nAnyway NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s ultimately her choice if she wants to live there with you or not. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t married and have been together for just a year. You\u2019d be idiotic to consider her in this situation. Get security for yourself. If she doesn\u2019t like it and bails then she ain\u2019t the one.", "NTA. A GF of one year is just that, a girlfriend of one year.\n\nThat she thinks she should have been involved in the process when you dont live together and are not engaged is a little bit bizarre and to me, would be a red flag.\n\nYou do you, Sir! Congrats on the new abode!", "NTA- like you said, the market is very competitive and unless you\u2019re very wealthy it is difficult to get a house you truly want. seriously, so many people i see around me are getting into houses that aren\u2019t exactly what they want but are putting money into them to make the kitchen nicer, the living room nicer etc. ain\u2019t nothing wrong with that, especially if you save money in the long run. her crying is pretty childish in my opinion. and she sounds ungrateful. this is the difference between men and women. you yourself are just fine with living in that house and putting money into it, she is not. men are just as happy in a card board box as they are any house. sounds to me like she would want it her way and not care about your thoughts on the matter", "NTA. Unless she planned on contributing financially to the purchase it isn't her house to pick.", "NTA .. you're not married... she didnt  contribute her money... she cant control your money and how you spend your money...", "NTA. \n\nIt's YOUR house and you made your decisions as needed according to the situation at hand. If she was contributing anything towards the purchase I could see her reacting this way. But she isn't. \nSure, she can have her opinion on it. But her reaction here is a huge red flag for me. She's balking about how you're spending YOUR OWN MONEY because the house you chosedoesn't match the aesthetic she had in mind, and because there's a tiny toll. \nShe's looking a gift horse in the mouth here. I'd seriously reconsider moving her in right away till you get this sorted one way or the other.", "NAH. It's your money, you're welcome to do with it as you please, but also understand that if your intention is for her to live with you in it you *really* should have involved her in the process more than you did. I get you guys have only been dating for a year, but if it's serious enough that you two want to live together, I think she should have been involved. Even if it's entirely your money I *don't* think relationships are always going to be 50/50 and if you like her so much you want her to live with you, I think she deserves a place she's going to like as well. No, you don't have to go out of your way to accommodate for her desires since, again, it *is* your money, but it would have been nice if she had a say in it. I still don't think this makes you an asshole, I just think it would have been a good thing to do.\n\nI can also understand her disappointment and I don't think she's an asshole here either, since the person she's dating just bought a house without really involving her in the process at all, and now wants her to live there with him. It would be a sore spot for me, too. If i were in her position, I'd feel like a bit weird about it; despite being serious and wanting to forge a life together, my partner's still going off making *major* life decisions that are expected to impact both of us without really talking to me about it at all. \n\nSo yeah, NAH but I think it would have been the right thing to do.", "NTA- She needs to chill. You guys only been together for a year... You did let her know you were looking for houses, you did not need her \" approval\"", "Soft YTA - yes it\u2019s your money and your house, but if you are building a life together and expecting her to move in, then she deserves the chance to give some input. You pulled the rug out from under her and made a unilateral decision on your living situation. If you had talked to her first and given her the opportunity to give input and still decided to buy it even if she didn\u2019t want to move into it with you, then you would be NYA. But completely cutting her out of the discussion is not how you behave with a partner. Your actions show that you are building a life for yourself, not for the two of you together. You should apologize for not even giving her a chance to provide input on whether she would be ok living there.", "The answer will depend on the perspective. And keep in mind, no one in Reddit is in your relationship. So, it\u2019s really about what kind of relationship you want. \n\nConsidering you want to spend the rest of your life with her, YTA for making her feel like you\u2019re not going to consider her feelings on big decisions. \n\nThat said, you can absolutely prioritize yourself over someone else and not feel like a bad person.

You wouldn't move into a rental without inspecting it yet now she has to move into this house without inspection. \n\nYet later you talk about you two decorating it together and stability for both of you - if you were looking at it this way she should have been included a lot sooner. I know you have to move fast but there is time for a phone call and text to share a link at the very least. \n\nShe should have communicated clearer that she wanted to be involved rather than acting this way after the fact. I would have a clear conversation about it now.\n\nUnfortunately the way it's been handled she will likely never feel at home there, and if you want to build a future together you'll probably need to look at buying something else together.", "NAH, you're free to buy a house with your money. But I personally would never move to a place I didn't choose (alone or with the one I'm going to live with).", "NAH. I think you two have different views of your relationship and need to have a talk about. There\u2019s being in a relationship and building a life with someone. It 100% is your money and your choice, but at the same time if she\u2019s thinking you two are more then I get that it feels isolating for you to be taking this big step without her. There\u2019s making decisions for self and there\u2019s making decisions as a couple. A good relationship has a balance of both. Buying a house is a decision that could fall under either depending on the relationship. Either way, congrats on your house! You deserve to be excited about it!", "Soft YTA. If you two already discussed her moving in, I feel like you should\u2019ve taken her feelings into account. You chose not to, and now she doesn\u2019t like the house. Not having any say in where you\u2019re going to be staying for a few years could be a dealbreaker for some people.

Not for buying a house like in the title, but for not including her in the process.\n\nYou say it's awkward to navigate, but you've exchanged that early awkwardness about planning for the future for THIS. You've planned -past tense - for the future and your gf wasn't a part of it.   \nWhat you've told her through your actions is that you aren't comfortable discussing the future (so she might be feeling insecure. Does she know you want her to be in your future?) And that you will make life altering decisions alone. \n\nYou cannot use logic to make emotions go away. You admit you were thoughtless. She is very hurt right now. Apologise, and learn to communicate. It might feel awkward but it will be worth it.", "You\u2019re NTA for buying the house. \n\nYTA for lack of communication with your girlfriend.

While I don\u2019t think she should have veto power, nor should the decision be 50/50 bc it is entirely your money and your name on the deed etc, you still expect her to live there. \n\nBc of this, I think she should have at least been able to see the place? It feels like you made a really big decision without talking to your partner about it. I\u2019m not saying she should have the final say, but allowing her some input on the place she\u2019s expected to live isn\u2019t a big ask imo.", "NTA. Reading this post gave me a lot of red flags! It sounds like your girlfriend is jealous honestly. Either of your new found money or you being able to buy a house. I\u2019m 32 and I know it can be hard seeing people your age accomplishing things you haven\u2019t yet and feel like you should have by a certain time frame/age. Buying a house is a huge achievement!! Congratulations!! (Especially since you\u2019ve lost many offers I\u2019m sure you were super excited to finally have \u201cwon\u201d/had an offer accepted).\n\nSo let me point out. You\u2019ve been dating your GF for roughly 12 months! Things can change. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very much in love and not to be that person, but not all relationships in love last. Also, you don\u2019t live together! And while you see a future together she might not even move in anytime soon. I know you mention this 0.35\u00a2 bridge like it\u2019s a problem but if you take it twice a day every single day for a month that\u2019s 20$/monthly which seems reasonable. In NYC our tolls are that much a day LOL \nUltimately She should be happy for you, you are not required to ask her opinion and you did many times. But an opportunity rose and you took it before you missed out. Her behavior just seems childish to me. Whether she\u2019s jealous or felt left out she should be biting her tongue and be happy for you because this is a big milestone, you\u2019re willing to share your home with her which would mean a decrease in her rent and which would obviously mean you see a long future with her- which most girls would be happy about.\n\nGentle reminder- PLEASE only put your name on the deed!! Whether she\u2019s contributing rent or to the mortgage/ utilities or whatever, you\u2019re not married and you\u2019re putting down all the Money. I don\u2019t want to see you back here that you broke up one day and she wants half your house!!", "I am not sure you\u2019ll find consensus among the crowd here. \n\nI\u2019ll roll with a very light YTA, but I can certainly see the other side. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what real estate will look like in 5 years but there is a better than zero chance you will make money when you sell. Beyond that you may have a nice investment property for your future if being a landlord is on your agenda of things to do in the future. \n\n\nIt sounds like maybe she\u2019s not great at communicating and you\u2019re not great at mind reading. It isn\u2019t really your job to read her mind if she\u2019s unwilling to fully express her desires. That said, you clearly see a future with her and want to make a life with her, so she should have had some input into the process. As you say, that is an awkward situation because she isn\u2019t financially involved. \n\nMaybe a long conversation with her about what was happening and why would have smoothed things over. Since you see her living there with you, perhaps she can have input into the remodeling and decorating so she can live in a place she is comfortable with. \n\nEnd of the day this house isn\u2019t your \u201cforever home\u201d but is a good investment and one worth making under the conditions you laid out.", "INFO-\n\nYou say you've been dating a little over a year.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (35M) girlfriend (30F) suggested I ask other people what they think about this situation.\n\nWe've been dating for a bit over a year now and things are going overall great. Our personalities are complimentary, we think the same way about a lot of things, but not everything because that would be boring, we love each other and are committed to each other, and recently started talking about making a life together.  We don't live together but have planned on it.\n\nRecently I came into some money and decided it would be smart to buy a house. We live in a city with a real estate market that's still extremely competitive and never really slows down that much. I saw a really nice house on the market for $425k, I put in an offer for $515k, waived appraisal, waived inspection - and came in fifth out of eleven bids. I put in other offers on other houses which I thought were strong but reasonable and lost them all. The local subreddit regularly has posts from people trying to navigate this market and finding themselves shut out.\n\nMy realtor sent me a link to this one that had gone on the market, been sold in 2 days, and then financing from the buyer fell through so it was back on. It was the week before Easter, a lot of realtors and buyers were taking that week off, a lot of properties were listed but not showing until the following week, just a generally slow time. The stars aligned and I put in an offer at asking price without many concessions and won. This place is on the low side of my budget which means that there is plenty of money left over to decorate and design it and make it really nice.\n\nBut, I did not involve my girlfriend a lot in the buying process. It's kind of awkward to navigate - we're not married, it's my money, but I would like to live there with her and there's no real playbook on how to navigate this very millennial situation. She came with me to look at some houses which I didn't end up making offers on, and when I let her know I was going to go look at this one she said \"I'm curious about it\" but didn't really indicate she wanted to see it.\n\nWhen I told her that I won the offer, she started crying because she wasn't happy about the house. The listing pictures weren't the best. It's very close to the city but it's over a bridge with a 35 cent toll. I was hoping for a hug around the neck and someone to share my happiness. Since then, things have been kind of rocky. I've got this huge exciting thing happening and I feel like I can barely talk about it with her. She can't get over that I made this decision on my own.\n\nYes, I could have been more thoughtful and I should have involved her more in the process. I solely chose the place we both may be living for the next 2 - 5 years. The result of my actions is that we have secure shelter with the expenses taken care of, as well as a good budget to design and decorate it and fill it with the things we love most. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Nta\n\n\nBased on what you said, it's very possible you could be underwater in a few years when you sell. However, that is completely your decision. \n\n\nAt the end of the day it's your money and your decision.  Your girlfriend is getting ahead of herself.  You bought what you wanted and did it your way.\n\nThis isn't a joint purchase.  It's your purchase solely.", "NTA.  She needs to grow up and get over herself. It's your money and this is not your forever home. As you say, it's an investment and place to live for the next 2 to 5 years. \n\nEven though it's not her money and you are not living together, you have involved her in the process: You've been clear that you intended to buy a house and indicated your interest in this particular house.  Her beef is that you did not involve her enough.\n\nIf she can't get some perspective and stop giving you the cold shoulder about how you spend your money, then maybe she isn't the kind of partner that will be able to handle actual issues that life throws at you.  Congrats on  your home. Sorry that your gf is acting so unreasonably.", " NTA. If she\u2019s not contributing to the purchase and it\u2019s in your name only then it\u2019s your investment and your decision. You\u2019ve only been together a year so unless she wanted to go 50/50 with you and you were down for that, it\u2019s not really up for discussion. \n\nIf she\u2019s interested in owning property she can start saving a down payment and you could buy together in the future if you\u2019re still together \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nVery similar situation when I bought my house, my partner and I were a couple but a newish couple so he had nothing to do with my house purchase. He moved in with me about 6 months after I bought it. We will probably buy together in the future when we\u2019ve accrued more savings and the market settles (hopefully lol)", "Nta you aren't living together *now*.  If she hates it, then you can keep living seperate and now you have a nice house to sell if you do decide to move into together.", "NTA. I was in your same position. It\u2019s my money, my credit, my responsibility. I asked my bf to accompany me on showings as he could and give his opinion. We happened to agree on my choice of home. However, he is not on the deed and can walk away whenever he wants. He gets the freedom, and I get the responsibility AND the choice of home.", "NTA - You said it yourself, this is your investment with your money.", "NTA, it\u2019s your money. I think you two should have had a more in depth convo about expectations reguarding decisions and expectations but that\u2019s her fault too. Houses go super fast nowadays. You have to put in offers on the spot as I\u2019m sure you realized. She may not understand everything that goes into home buying and how fast decisions need to be made. You can\u2019t even take the night to think about it. People can swoop it out from under you that fast. \n\nMaybe couples counseling. But the house is bought so she can either make the best of it and do better next time or maybe this is a break for her which you may need to accept", "NAH", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s an investment. Tell her you invested in this house with the hopes you can sell it later and buy the home if your/her dreams. And tell her you would love her input on decorating in a way that will increase its resale value.", "NTA it\u2019s your investment, your money, you live alone so it\u2019s your choice alone. \n\nHowever, if she does have strong objections to living there- when/if you do decide to move into together you may need to be sympathetic to her wants and needs since then it\u2019ll be a two person decision. It\u2019s important to respect each other in that sense. You can always rent out your place and move elsewhere. \n\nAlso you are well within your right to decorate as you see fit but remember if/when you move in together (whether this home or another) you will need to adjust.\n\nEdit: also if she does move in to your house need to be aware of common law rights in your state. Please speak about the legalities of the living arrangement and how she will contribute financially and what that entitles her too. You need to do this even if you get married. If people are too insecure to speak about it you need to go to counselling and work on communication. I\u2019ve watched too many people get screwed as the homeowner and the move in partner.", "NTA - Look, fundamentally, it's YOUR money, YOUR house and YOUR decision.  If you were buying a house TOGETHER, then yes she should have been consulted.  But you are not.  \n\nI think the bigger issue here is that maybe you have different ideas of where you are at in the relationship.  Sure, this isn't the dream house.  But it is A house.  You can live there alone, you can live there with her, you can rent it out and live somewhere else.\n\nYou need to sit down and have a big honest conversation about money, joining finances and commitment in your relationship, because right now you are not on the same page.", "NAH. The issue is now, for her, it is a matter of live there with him or don\u2019t live together. Normally, it might be a joint decision in where to live. I would say NAH. He has every right to buy a house. But I can totally see why she\u2019s not happy about it. \n\nEven more: he may want her to pay rent, and Reddit mostly thinks that\u2019s reasonable. But renters usually get to pick where they live. This is not an arms\u2019 length negotiation.  She had every right to be upset, doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t have done it, could result in a break up. Hope it was worth it, meant sincerely, not snarkily.", "INFO GF is sending up some HUGE red flags here.  How will finances be split when you move in together?  Is she contributing to the downpayment?  Will her name be on the loan or the deed?", "NTA although borderline NAH. If you are serious about being with her you could have discussed and involved her in the process. I dont really buy that it had to be done so quickly that you didnt have the opportunity to discuss this house with her. However, it also does seem like you tried discussing it but she wasnt so interested. \n\nAt the end of the day its your money.

I fear you may regret that in the future.", "NAH. \n\nBut what stage of the relationship are you two on ?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get engaged and married within a year, then yes, you *should* be planning this with her.

You made a smart decision that will help both of you, and just you if things don't work out.", "Soft YTA.\n\nIf you planned on living with her at this new place, you should have made more of an effort to involve her in the process.\n\nWhilst it can't be her decision to spend your money, what you're saying by not involving her is that you don't care if she's going to be happy with it and were prepared for her to leave if she wasn't. That damages the relationship.\n\nIf you want a steady long-term relationship, **always** make an effort involve your partner in decisions that will affect them, even if they don't seem important to you or you don't feel like it's up to them. You're a team.", "NTA. I can't imagine the financial circumstances where you get to live rent-free in a half a million dollar home but are salty about a 35 cent toll.

She can just not live there.\n\nNTA", "NTA your money, your investment. If it was going to be a joint purchase, that would be a different story.

OP made a unilateral decision based on what is best for him, not based on what is best for them together.", "This is a great way to look at it. Dating isn't a lifetime commitment.  When that comes, you can talk about how to proceed. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like op made some critical errors with the home buying process.  But those are his to make.", "And before she moves in get an ironclad cohabitation agreement. It is your investment and should be protected", " I think people in a relationship should each have their own money, in addition to a joint that pays for common things. Then they can buy things without asking and have some autonomy.", "^ this - while the decision ultimately lies with OP, not involving the GF makes it look like he is planning for the future as an individual, not as a partnership.", "Because his decisions affect her too. Even if they are not married she still deserves the opportunity to give input. She should not have veto power or any power over the final decision, but OP should have given her opportunity to discuss the discussion with him before he made it since she now has to choose between either living there with him or never living with him/ not living together for the next 2-5 years. If they are planning on building a life together, long term decisions should at least be discussed together before they are made", "I was the GF in this situation before there was definitely resentment because I started paying rent in a house I would not have chosen and it was more rent then what I would have chosen. It didn't help that my bf was adamant about splitting things 50/50 which eventually just felt like I was subsidizing the lifestyle he wanted.", "A big decision like this without any input from her might make her feel as though he\u2019s making plans and she has no say so and is ultimately left just dealing with it or leaving and you\u2019re right, if she doesn\u2019t love the place she will end of resenting him especially if multiple repairs come up and she has to come out of pocket to help fix them. \n\nShe might come around and love it but if I was the gf, in my mind I would question if he would make more big decisions without me in the future.", ">I would apologize and let her know she should have been included in the decision of where she lives\n\nThey aren't engaged and they don't currently live together.

We either rent or buy together or live separately. \n\nI've heard to many stories of people getting kicked out (not the same tenant protections where I'm from if your landlord live at the same address) or houses getting remortgaged without the non owning partner's knowledge for stupid reasons. I don't want to put myself in a situation like that.", "She sounds more than ungrateful here. She's got no skin in the game and this round of the game is finished. \nShe needs to suck it up or find someone else to leech off of.", "I'm going to be going through this within the year. My fiance knows that since he's not contributing towards the purchase- that he won't have much of a say in it. And it's not going to be our forever house anyhow, so he's fine with it and happy that we're going to have a brand new house regardless of where it is and what the layout is. \nIf he pulled this shit after the fact- there would be problems.", "She's not contributing any money towards this massive purchase. She doesn't get a say in it. Her sulking about this is totally an AH move on her part.", "SO he should include so that if they break up he's stuck with a house he chose with her in mind?\n\nJeez. \n\nIf she hates the house they could move elsewhere together and he can rent the house out.\n\nIn what universe does a partner of 12 months get a say when they are contributing nothing and don't have a ring on their finger?\n\nYou people are out to lunch.", "Dude if she hates the place they can move together elsewhere and rent it and he can still make bank. Owning a home gives you more options, not less. \n\nHaving a partner you havent committed yourself to demand to be involved (and yet somehow not go to viewings or be involved on their own volition) has no right to veto power OR complaint. Its his investment. She should be proud of him for being a homeowner!

Is it any of her decision if he would have just moved apartments for example", "In hindsight, I might have been able to do another viewing of the place.  However, you never know what will happen.  I lost another bid because I made a good, competitive offer that expired at 11:00 AM and someone made a more competitive offer at 9:00 AM.  Someone could have come seen the place the next morning and put in a crazy offer just to secure it.  I definitely could have done a video walkthrough or something and wish I had thought of that but I was just really focused on the house.", "so how come he is an AH?", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever bought a house but it\u2019s very fast, even waiting a few hours can get it stolen out from underneath him. GF never made her expectations clear and crying about it when it\u2019s not her money is very childish", "Sounds like OP did involve her, but this final house he had to act fast.

They're not married, he owes her nothing.  And he did actually include her in the process.  If you would have read the post, you would know that she did walk a few houses with him.  She sounds entitled.", "Why?", "Did you both have relatively equal income at the time?   Personally, I'd be fine with paying something toward the house we lived in, though I'd expect it to be adjusted to just the actual interest AFTER the tax deduction and proportional to our incomes.", "She's not a leech, she's my girlfriend and I love her.  I'm very fortunate and happy to share my good fortune with her in a way that can benefit the both of us.", "I'm not suggesting that she should get to pick the house out, but like.... She's upset about the neighborhood too. These feel like basic things to agree upon, yeah? He did take her along to see several other houses. He ALREADY DID involve her in the process during some parts.", "Flip the script. A partner of 12 months gets to decide where \"you'll live for the next 2-5 years\" without any input?", "Notice how I said she should not have veto power? Do I think maybe she could have communicated better? Yeah, sure. And like I stated, I don\u2019t think OP was purposefully TA, but I do think if you expect someone to move into a place you\u2019re just buying they should at the least be able to see it. It would be different if he already owned the home, and wasn\u2019t actively in the process of looking. He wants them to live there for 2-5 years together. TOGETHER. She should have at the minimum seen a virtual tour of the place.", "Yes, but if they were planning to move into together and he moved apartments she should be part of the conversation. He isn\u2019t buying the house just for him to live in alone. He said he wants her to live there with him. If he was simply changing apartments, and she was not expected to live with him that\u2019s not the same thing as him buying a house with the expectation she will live there with him.", "I can understand that, how competitive the housing market is rn. I don\u2019t think you were purposefully TA, but I do think if she\u2019s expected to live there she should have at least seen it, even if it was a virtual walk through.", "Yes, I am very aware of what it takes to buy a house right now. I bought a home in 2020 during the crazy bidding wars and I am currently trying to buy a second one for an aging parent. OP 1000% could have and should have involved the GF. His decision to buy affected both of them and making the decision unilaterally without any input from her makes it look like he does not value her as a long term partner and is only looking out for his own interests.\n\nWaiting a few hours will rarely affect things if OP\u2019a real estate knows what they are doing. All contracts have a time on them which the seller has to decide to accept or reject. All OP\u2019s Agent needs to do is call  the selling agent and ask if there are any current offers/ what their acceptance deadline is and then tell them they are working on an offer and will get it to the seller before the deadline. So long as the selling agent knows the offer is coming, they will advise the client to consider all offers received before the deadline. Then OP knows exactly how much time he has to make an offer and discuss it with the GF.", "Not if OP wants to keep the GF/ make a life together. She is not a casual fling, she is a partner. If he wants a life with her he should get her input on long term/major decisions. Even if he ultimately decided something that does not align with her wants, she should still be given the opportunity for input.", "No, he made double what I made. I had no issues living within my means before we dated but dating him caused me to not be able to save any money and go into a bit of CC debt. \n\nI was young and dumb so not entirely his fault but he definitely wasn't being considerate of me.", "Fair enough! Apologies for calling her a leech. Hopefully see sees what a great opportunity this really is and stops sulking very soon.", "It's actually a neighborhood that she highlighted as one she wanted to move into.  However I guess it's different when it's reality vs just a hypothetical.", "Sure, he tried to include her and then this happened. He had a time limited opportunity and he did what he needed to. She's free to buy her own house where she wants with her own money if the neighborhood he chose is that terrible.\nOh, wait, she doesn't have the money to buy her own house where she wants. Tough old life.", "She wanted the neighborhood. She doesn't have to move there. They have only been together for one year he can buy what he wants with is money", "No. Because i dont live with him yet and us living together is an idea.\n\nThat being said, with today's rents moving into a partners place and presumably having no mortgage and only having to pay utilities and basic costs (lower then market rent) instead of astronomical rent costs that won't contribute in any way to my future - would be a fuckin boon to be grateful for.\n\nI'd be glad to live in a place that isn't ideal, or 'mine too' until we buy a future home together for the life we are planning together when i have the means to contribute to the home too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Just as she cant decide what house he buys- he cant decide to make her live there. She can put up boundaries too and say - when we move together i would like to get an apartment together and for your to rent the place because i wont live there. He can choose to agree or not. He isn't taking ANY autonomy away from her. She isnt his wife.", "If i am not engaged, im not about to buy a house for a future that isn't even in the cards yet.\n\nWhen they do discuss living together (as in a thing that's not sometime in future but actually PLANNING IT) then i can see her having something to say about where he lives. But they aren't. A year together is *nothing*\\- why would any rational person make a half a million investment taking into account the feelings of someone who could walk away tomorrow? So he then gets stiffed with a house full of broken dreams?\n\nA great rule of thumb for life is not to make long-term decisions based on short-term emotions. GF is being a bit of an entitled AH here.", "She\u2019s a gf of one year who does not live with him. Though he seems to want a future with her his investment is his own. SHE did not make her expectation for involvement clear to him. Perhaps he\u2019s to blame there too but there\u2019s no ring and this is a large sum of HIS money. Her crying fit alone is a huge red flag. I stick with NTA", "If she wants an opinion on the house she can chip in some cash for it then.", "The crying and sulking is what gets me. Very immature", "i think money makes people weird, and she's looking at you and seeing dollarsigns and a missed opportunity.\n\nRegardless of what you do here- recognise that a partner of 1 year who doesn't have a ring on her finger shouldn't be given a say in your major life decisions. You can always sell and upgrade when/if you guys move on to greater things in your relationship. Until that time though, she should be proud of you right now and she's giving you shit instead- and all  for a standard she never bothered to *discuss with you* while you were house hunting. If she had expectations she should have told them to you instead of staying silent and getting mad after the fact. It's problematic and if i were you it would give me pause. \n\nJust sayin.", "But that's what he said. He expected her to give him a hug and be excited about where he had decided for both of them. He's shocked Pikachu face by the fact that she's not thrilled about it.\n\nTHAT is what makes him an asshole.", "Again, I said she should have been able to see the house. I didn\u2019t say he should have gotten her to design her ideal layout and refuse to buy anything but. This is simply my opinion, we don\u2019t have to agree. This is just my opinion on the matter.", "Do people only get a voice if they pay for it? She is supposed to be his partner, his decisions affect her, especially because it sounds like they have been talking about living together/building a life together long term. While she should not be the deciding factor in his decision, her input should have at least been a factor.", "Then she doesn\u2019t move in, problem solved. He\u2019s not making her move in with him so she doesn\u2019t like it she can keep renting."]}
