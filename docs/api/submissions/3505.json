It almost caused an accident and in the moment she \"thought for sure it was going to be over\". I picked her up from work that night and she completely had a breakdown about how she thought she was going to never see me again. I feel awful for her. To add on to this:\n\n1. This has happened to her before with her previous car (That we sold to get her current car, it was of a similar age)\n2. She has a conversation with me 3 weeks ago about how she wanted a new car because she doesn't think her car was safe (although, we have had this conversation before). There was nothing wrong with the car that triggered this, but it's getting close to a cold season here. I told her we need to hold out, and should get new tires for the moment.\n\nWe have older cars (2009 & 2010, both under 150k miles), but we keep up on maintenance & inspections and they work well with expected repairs at that age.\n\nNow, my wife doesn't want to drive her car anymore, or my car (because it's just as old) because she no longer feels safe driving them. Also with this being the second time this has happened, she wants to get something new, or at least fairly new, in the next two weeks.\n\nI told her I want her to get a new car, but we need to hold out a few more months to save up some cash. Our money is tight, we're planning on buying a house next year so we need to keep saving for a down payment (we only have a total of 10k saved up, although we have no debt, this is really just an emergency fund) and the market is really, really bad for cars right now.  She broke down again about how about saving a little money isn't worth dying over, and while I really, really do understand her, making our largest purchase  \\*ever\\* in two weeks because of a scary experience sounds like we might be making an impulsive decision.\n\nTo meet her in the middle we rented a car from a rental shop for now so should could take some time to driving something \"newer\" because I feel like I couldn't push her to drive my old car after her dealing with all of this, but after a week she will either need to start driving her car again (understandable that she doesn't want to drive this), or my car (which I think she should, as my car has had no issues and low miles).\n\nAm I being an insensitive asshole here? I really don't want my wife to feel unsafe driving, and she really does deserve a new car, but we just don't have the money and I can help but feel this is something we will regret rushing into when I don't feel confident out our current financial situation.\n\nAdded context:  \nThe car is at the shop, we do not know yet what happened. I am 100% sure this was not my wife fault, she is great driver. When her last car broke down, I drove for 6 months. It broke down on me multiple times. It was just a used, cheap car that was not reliable. With the last car, the belt snapped on the highway.  It did get it's normal inspections and maintenance. I don't know how this was missed.\n\nI do not think, or have suggested her to, that she should continue driving her car.\n\nHowever, we do have two cars, one that I don't drive because I work from home. My suggestion is that she drive that for just a couple months. It's passed all inspections and has never had a problem, but it's a similar age as her previous one. For that reason she does not want to drive it.\n\nEdit 2:  \nPlease, enough the the skeptics that my wife is a bad driver, or this is somehow her fault or she's making this up.\n\n1. Her previous car's belt broke AFTER inspection and I was there when it was brought to be fixed.  She was an uber driver and drove 8+ hours per day. I drove the car after this because I didn't want he to drive it anymore and it had ton of problems with me as well.\n2. She was in morning traffic, with 4\\~5 cars moving at high speeds. Once a car shuts off it loses power steering any person would be worried. She did a fantastic job navigating the situation safely. Any reasonable person would be scared in that situation.", "created_utc": 1669718106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7qdrc/aita_for_telling_my_wife_no_to_buying_a_new_car/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I found out manufacturers will issue bulletins to the dealers mechanics regarding potential issues with vehicles.

Could you trade in both of your old cars for a slightly newer one? Cars age 5-10 with reasonable mileage are generally very dependable and affordable. You can choose a model with a good reputation for dependability. You will save money every month from only having one car. Even more if the car is cheaper to run than your old cars (taxes, fuel economy, maintenance)", "This exact same situation has happened to your wife twice?

Is she otherwise reasonable with spending money? It\u2019s like you feel like she is wanting to spend $ recklessly. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with replacing a 12 year old car especially if she was driving Uber even part of the time in it. She\u2019s coming at this with emotion due to her terrible experience. You\u2019re coming with logic, and your compromise of using your car isn\u2019t going to work at the moment. Both of you should do the math on this potential purchase and how it will work out for your other goals. Her feelings matter and the house goal/savings matter. It is also possible that you will find out this car repair cost is prohibitive and the choices will be narrowed by that further! Can the mechanic give you their take on the reliability/durability of the car?", "You need to believe your wife.\n\nShe's right, money isn't worth her life. She knew the car was dangerous to drive and she has a highway commute. \n\nBelieve your wife. \n\nYou are living in a fantasy world with these unreliable cars. I know you want to think they are fine, but you've described a good driver who keeps up with repairs who has her own job and who is a reasonable person, and you are telling her what she knows is wrong because it's financially inconvenient for you.\n\nBelieve her. Your marriage is at stake right now, and your highest priority should be listening to your partner.\n\nI don't think you're an AH so I'm putting NAH but you need to realign your priorities in your marriage. This is a time to sacrifice your stated personal financial goal to put your marriage and your wife first.", "These comments are *ridiculous*. I can\u2019t believe people are blaming your wife for this. Firstly, driving for 8 hours every day places an incredible amount of stress, wear and tear on the vehicle. Uber driving alone can cause your car to break down MUCH quicker than it normally would. The person who inspected your vehicle absolutely should have told you about the belt and so should have the maintenance folks. However, humans make mistakes and can be lazy- it\u2019s possible they just didn\u2019t check it. Secondly, I\u2019m certain you bought both cars used, which means it\u2019s possible that there were underlying issues with the vehicle you didn\u2019t know about (depending on where you bought it from). Finally, 2009 was 13 years ago! A decade old car bought used is absolutely going to break down at some point. Besides, I can think of few \u201cuser errors\u201d that cause an automatic car to just fucking break down randomly when it was running fine.\n\nAs for the issue you asked judgement on: NAH. She\u2019s terrified, and when you\u2019re terrified you\u2019re not thinking about things like fiscal stability. Hell, I popped a tire late at night alone on the highway five hours from home and it took me a full week to get back in my car. I was just irrationally scared it would happen again. You, on the other hand, didn\u2019t have a near death experience, so you\u2019re thinking about your financials and how to set y\u2019all up for success. It\u2019s just an awful situation- is there a way for her to get alternate transportation for like two months while you save up?", "Regarding edit 2\n\nDon't argue with dumbshits in AITA comments, half of them are people making up details and you literally have no reason to talk to those people", "Forget a car. Get her a motorcycle!!!! After that she probably won\u2019t ever drive the cage again lol. Good luck", "Info - Is her current car a hybrid? The sudden stopping on the highway sounds like something that happened to my partner's car (a 2007 model) when he needed to replace the battery. Once he got a new battery, the car worked totally fine! If that's the problem, a new battery could make the car much safer for a lot less money than an entirely new car. Just make sure you have a professional install it.", "YTA. A medical emergency doesn\u2019t have to be paid immediately. It\u2019s literally a federal law that an emergency cannot be turned away - and then you can make payments for the costs. That\u2019s even IF you have one, which is higher if you\u2019re driving crappy cars that shut down on the highway. \nYou could trade both older cars for one newer. You could put off buying a house for a year. You could look into compromises that will let your wife feel safe instead of asking her to just deal with it.", "YTA. Sell both cars, get a lease or finance a new low cost car - like a Kia.  Don\u2018t risk your wife\u2019s life over this. The house can wait a few months longer instead.", "I guess I'm not understanding the \"car shut off on the highway\". Also based on the years of cars listed I still don't understand how this is happening. Especially with the we take great care of the cars. I feel some information is missing. \n\nHere is why I say these things My family has four vehicles three driven almost every day. the newest is 2011 the oldest is 1996.  My 15yo son drives a 2009. All vehicles get regular oil change and tire rotation and other work out trust mechanic believes is needed. We have never broke down nor has a vehicle just shut off.  Almost the 2011 just clicked over 200k.  \n\nThe only odd thing that's happened is when the 2011s battery died it did this weird sequence that involves locking and unlocking the doors. But I was park in the driveway not driving.", "I've only lost power twice on the highways: Once is the alternator died during driving and eventually everything went, but I had time to make it to the shoulder. Another time is the timing belt snapped, and I was able to wobble to the shoulder on just momentum.", "YTA.  If she is too traumatized to drive, perhaps she needs to see a therapist for a few sessions to address the trauma.  She needs a safe car.  I realize you think 150,000 miles isn't much, but if it is an American car, it's on it's last legs.  If it's something like a Toyota or Honda or Subaru, it could have some life left in it, but I wouldn't throw a lot of money for maintenance on an American car with that many miles.", "There are recalls right now with Honda, that this happens. You should check to see if there\u2019s any recalls on both your vehicles.  \nNAH. You\u2019re n t a for wanting to wait, and neither is she for feeling unsafe driving.  But if you don\u2019t have the money you don\u2019t have the money.  New cars lose their value so quickly, what about a newer used car?", "I had a car that was 15 years old. One day it shut off randomly while driving and continued to do so for months. It got so bad I couldn\u2019t let my foot off the gas, which was unsafe in the hilly town where I lived, or it would shut off. I spent almost 2 grand to find out what caused it. I had to make so many repairs that did nothing to stop the issue. It was awful. Eventually I stopped driving that and drove my mom\u2019s car instead.\n\nI think this is probably a case of you probably need to put her in therapy before you buy a house.", "NAH. \n\nI don't blame your wife for wanting a new car, but if the money's  not there then the money's not there. If you can't figure out what's wrong with her old car and get it fixed, though, to at least give her some peace of mind, it's time to bite the bullet and get a new car.\n\nYou can always take awhile longer to save for a house, but if your wife dies because of this, a funeral can be pretty expensive too.", "NTA, I think your wife is being dramatic to try and force you to buy a new car.", "I had a car that was only a year old that had to have the whole engine replaced. A smart mechanic at the dealer noticed it had a major issue that could have caused serious danger if I was driving it. Even new cars have issues.  But OP\u2019s wife\u2019s situations is interesting to say the least. How knowledgeable is she with cars? Could she be tampering with them to convince OP there\u2019s something wrong to force him to buy her a new one?", "I\u2019ve had this happen to me. The mechanic said \u201csometimes with older cars with more miles things just happen.\u201d  I was so scared. I thought I was going to die. My brakes stopped working. The steering wheel locked. I had to force my car over and pull the E Break. It was so scary.", "My car is a 2008 and is starting to die on me. At the last repair pickup the mechanic literally said the next time it breaks down I should just scrap it. I can\u2019t afford a new car so I\u2019m just crossing my fingers what happened to OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t happen to me. It\u2019s a NAH situation for me, cars are just ridiculously expensive right now, even used ones, but in an ideal world driving from point A to B wouldn\u2019t make people wonder if this is the day they die.", "She used to drive for Uber is what OP said on a comment. So I think it's safe to say, it's just high use for long periods that wear cars out faster.", "Yep, happened to me too in a Honda no less. Unfortunately it is well known that reddit is predominantly men, and lots of men are untrusting of women driving :/", "Happened to my best friend and I in her older car a couple of years ago on a busy road in Orlando. Was thankfully not a highway but was freaking terrifying.", "New cars can have issues but like everything cars have a lifespan. If a new car has issues it\u2019s probably due to a manufacturing issue, which is highly unlikely. Whereas an old car is very likely to be at the end of its lifespan and no longer safe.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I was driving with my mom in her 10+ year old car and it stopped in the middle of the road. Thankfully this was in downtown so it was fine, but if it was on the highway it might not have been. I totally understand the feeling of a car not being safe because it *isn\u2019t* safe. Nobody liked the idea but the car had to be replaced.", "This happened to me years ago with a Ford Taurus that was fairly new. It would just shut off completely at random times, thank goodness never on a highway just side roads going around 40 or less. Turned out to be some problem with the fuel system, they replaced the entire gas tank, and it never happened again. It would have been a much bigger deal if it happened on the expressway like with your wife.", "Yeah and that medical emergency almost just happened. I AM from the US I know how crazy the medical system is. You're an AH for minimizing your wife's fears.", "Can you sell the two old cars you have and get one new car? If your solution is a one car solution anyway\u2026 do you then save any on insurance if you\u2019re down to one car? \n\nYou may need to hold off another year to buy a house but it sounds well worth it to me. It\u2019s an emergency fund but to me this is pretty close to any emergency. When our 15 year old car stopped in traffic yeah that\u2019s when we dropped into new car is urgent mode", "Okay... Than I guess it is time for a better car. Safety always first.", "Man even if she is faking it (which I really doubt) she\u2019s not TA for wanting to feel safer while driving - and neither is OP TA for acknowledging financial constraints", "It was the weirdest thing. It was also 40 degrees C that day, and the other time it happened it was also hot...maybe something just over heated? No idea though, mechanics were stumped.", "No of course not, I just mean that he mentions it more than once,so I was wondering if there was a chronic condition that seems to make that more likely than needing reliable transportation"]}
