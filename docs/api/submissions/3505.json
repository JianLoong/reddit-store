It almost caused an accident and in the moment she \"thought for sure it was going to be over\". I picked her up from work that night and she completely had a breakdown about how she thought she was going to never see me again. I feel awful for her. To add on to this:\n\n1. This has happened to her before with her previous car (That we sold to get her current car, it was of a similar age)\n2. She has a conversation with me 3 weeks ago about how she wanted a new car because she doesn't think her car was safe (although, we have had this conversation before). There was nothing wrong with the car that triggered this, but it's getting close to a cold season here. I told her we need to hold out, and should get new tires for the moment.\n\nWe have older cars (2009 & 2010, both under 150k miles), but we keep up on maintenance & inspections and they work well with expected repairs at that age.\n\nNow, my wife doesn't want to drive her car anymore, or my car (because it's just as old) because she no longer feels safe driving them. Also with this being the second time this has happened, she wants to get something new, or at least fairly new, in the next two weeks.\n\nI told her I want her to get a new car, but we need to hold out a few more months to save up some cash. Our money is tight, we're planning on buying a house next year so we need to keep saving for a down payment (we only have a total of 10k saved up, although we have no debt, this is really just an emergency fund) and the market is really, really bad for cars right now.  She broke down again about how about saving a little money isn't worth dying over, and while I really, really do understand her, making our largest purchase  \\*ever\\* in two weeks because of a scary experience sounds like we might be making an impulsive decision.\n\nTo meet her in the middle we rented a car from a rental shop for now so should could take some time to driving something \"newer\" because I feel like I couldn't push her to drive my old car after her dealing with all of this, but after a week she will either need to start driving her car again (understandable that she doesn't want to drive this), or my car (which I think she should, as my car has had no issues and low miles).\n\nAm I being an insensitive asshole here? I really don't want my wife to feel unsafe driving, and she really does deserve a new car, but we just don't have the money and I can help but feel this is something we will regret rushing into when I don't feel confident out our current financial situation.\n\nAdded context:  \nThe car is at the shop, we do not know yet what happened. I am 100% sure this was not my wife fault, she is great driver. When her last car broke down, I drove for 6 months. It broke down on me multiple times. It was just a used, cheap car that was not reliable. With the last car, the belt snapped on the highway.  It did get it's normal inspections and maintenance. I don't know how this was missed.\n\nI do not think, or have suggested her to, that she should continue driving her car.\n\nHowever, we do have two cars, one that I don't drive because I work from home. My suggestion is that she drive that for just a couple months. It's passed all inspections and has never had a problem, but it's a similar age as her previous one. For that reason she does not want to drive it.\n\nEdit 2:  \nPlease, enough the the skeptics that my wife is a bad driver, or this is somehow her fault or she's making this up.\n\n1. Her previous car's belt broke AFTER inspection and I was there when it was brought to be fixed.  She was an uber driver and drove 8+ hours per day. I drove the car after this because I didn't want he to drive it anymore and it had ton of problems with me as well.\n2. She was in morning traffic, with 4\\~5 cars moving at high speeds. Once a car shuts off it loses power steering any person would be worried. She did a fantastic job navigating the situation safely. Any reasonable person would be scared in that situation.", "created_utc": 1669718106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7qdrc/aita_for_telling_my_wife_no_to_buying_a_new_car/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I found out manufacturers will issue bulletins to the dealers mechanics regarding potential issues with vehicles.

Could you trade in both of your old cars for a slightly newer one? Cars age 5-10 with reasonable mileage are generally very dependable and affordable. You can choose a model with a good reputation for dependability. You will save money every month from only having one car. Even more if the car is cheaper to run than your old cars (taxes, fuel economy, maintenance)", "This exact same situation has happened to your wife twice?

Used wasn\u2019t even worth it, maybe 5k cheaper for 40,000 miles and who knows what previous maintenance problems. Good luck.", "This happened to me with my HHR twice...before all that stuff about them shutting off and locking up including the brakes while driving and ending up killing people came out. It was so scary.", "What kind of cars are they? Did you make sure there was no recall?", "Is there anyone unhappy with your wife? This happened to my mom too, turns out, someone was pouring water into her tank. Make sure the fuel flap is fine and it isn't some kind of Foul play.", "Was it a Volkswagen? I had two new beetles and both had electrical problems and both would shutdown in the middle of traffic. Friggen traumatized both times. Volkswagen is known for electrical issues.", "By \"cars don't just shut off\" I didn't mean they don't EVER shut off. I meant that there is a reason, and usually a bad reason.", "My newer car I bought in March hasn\u2019t stopped on the highway. On the other hand, my 2012 car that I traded in for my new car, blew its transmission and died on the freeway. My car had regular inspections too and multiple people missed that the transmission was just about ready to go. That\u2019s the main reason I no longer have that car.\n\nYou also mentioned that your car has passed all inspections. But you also mentioned that her car did too and then the belt broke. I\u2019m not super surprised she doesn\u2019t want to drive your car either.\n\nEDIT TO ADD- one added benefit of a new car is if things break, it\u2019ll most likely be under warranty, which will be cheaper than replacing a part not under warranty and it\u2019s not always guaranteed that the shop will be able to find a part.\n\nThe transmission on my previous car was well over $2,000. I also eventually had to replace one of the headlights. The shop I took it too had to go to a junkyard and hope they had the parts needed to replace the electrical parts and the housing the light was in. That was $800.", "Are you sure she\u2019s not doing something to try to get a new car? She\u2019s not lying? Or she put the wrong gas in?", "Problem is some of the used car markets suck out loud at the moment. My father had to get a new-new car at years start because, unless he bought an absolute shitbox, I *could not find* a used car that wasn't as expensive as a new off the lot vehicle, and if I did they were usually sold within hours.\n\nI haven't looked if things got any better by now, but it was *bad* for a while.", "Oh i see, apologies", "That sounds like the damn alien from Nope was prowling around.", "Both of mine did that.  The blown head gasket couldn\u2019t get above 20, but the transmission problem happened occasionally for months before I was able to get it sorted (which was a big mistake on my part - if it\u2019d been sorted after the first or second time, the mechanic told me the repair would\u2019ve been about 20% of what replacing the damn transmission cost).", "It is still awful. My old car died last fall. The market was terrible and I wound up with a lemon. It was in and out of the shop and needs expensive work. But dealerships are making some deals. I wound up with a car payment I am not stoked about, but will manage, because it\u2019s the only way to get something safe. The lemon car died on me in traffic one night, and my kid was with me and never ever felt safe in the car after that. I think having constant car troubles for well over a year broke part of my soul.", "Then it doesn't sound like you're ready to buy a house next year either.", "Very true", "Yta. Her car is actually not safe and your being an ah", "YTA. You don't get to put a time limit on your wife to get over something traumatic. You're prioritizing buying a house in the future for something you need today, because it's her and not you. Get her a damn car she's comfortable with.", "Yta - you're concerned about the car market but not the housing market for next year? A house is not a necessity. A car in an area without public transit is. Cold and tires don't magically make your car stop in the middle of the highway - this is not a fix. It's going to be 5 weeks of her asking for a new car - this is not a \"2 week after scary experience.\"", "YTA cars don't just stop that is extremely dangerous. If you continue to drive a car that is not safe on the road you are putting yourself and everyone on the road in danger.\n\nYou have 10k in the bank as an emergency fund,  this is an emergency. You don't have to use it all or get a brand new car, just what will make your monthly payments doable. Make a plan to fully pat it off so you don't get ruined by interest rates.\n\nAnd look I get the point that it is a medical emergency funds. I'm not American but I understand medical costs must be terrifying. But if you or your wife are in a car accident 10k is probably only going to cover the ambulance ride. And you sure as hell won't be thinking good things we have our savings.\n\nAgain I know this is a big financial commitment but it's really what you have to do. You also aren't saving money driving a rental for months or fixing up cars that don't have much time on the road left in them.", "I\u2019d get her the new car. 10k isn\u2019t gonna get you a down payment on a new house anyway.", "Not a car expert but one time I fueled up car at somewhere that had bad gas.  When whatever was in the gas would make it to the engine it would cut out.  At the time I was driving a stick so while it was moving I was able to pop the clutch and it restarted. \n\nEnded having to have the gas tank drained, cleaned and then replaced gas filter about every two weeks for a couple of months. \n\nJust wondering if the could have been just a bit of something in the gas?  Likely not but thought would mention.", "I think she has a decision to make since she has the choice to drive your car - does she want to buy a home or new car or a newer car. It is a terrible time to buy a new car, I agree. I would rather have a home, but I'm not the one traumatized. There is nothing to say that even a new car won't have some type of issue and more than likely some type of problem with a newer car. At least a home doesn't lose its value when you drive it off the lot.", "I have had it happen with two different cars too. 1st one blew out the starting module (no electricity, no breaks nothing worked anymore somehow), 2nd overheated, started smoking and also shut off. Both times I was able to safely navigate to the road shoulder, the 1st yime even through the 5pm traffic at 50mph. Even with one annual government regulated check AND a general maintenance check, so both had had least two times a year seen the mechanic. One car was 18 years old, the other 16. Still happened.\n\n\n\nIts one of the most scary things that have ever happened to me in traffic. I completely recognize the fear in OP's wife. I don't have any advice, but it would help if the mechanic could find the issue and fix it. If they dont know or cant find anything, I would not advice using that car anymore.", "Your wife is *scared.*  What is her health, physical and mental, worth to you?", "How much do you think the medical expenses would be if she got hit/hit someone else?", "Seriously? You literally will not compromise in any way. Yta sooo much.", "Oh yah, that would def ruin that plan.", "I\u2019m surprised no one has suggested she was cheating on OP. Clearly, something so suspicious about two cars breaking down! /s", "He\u2019s, I tried to tell my mom that. The more you drive, the more often something can happen.", "Yes, Hondas are great.  Honda dealerships are another story."]}
