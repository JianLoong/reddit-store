But I think you have a husband problem.", "Why are you married to someone that puts your wants and needs behind the rest of his family?\n\nNTA but if she stays with you it'll be long term. I'd definitely be leaving if she was staying. And don't do any of the paperwork etc. If they want her there, they can all figure out how to do that stuff.", "NTA having someone stay in your own home should always be a joint decision between you both. And if one of you says no then that\u2019s that. The fact that he told you she\u2019s staying anyway makes him the AH. You\u2019ve been through a lot and deserve to be comfortable in your own home. And why does your husband always expect you to take care of everything for his family? I get that they may need help but it shouldn\u2019t always fall on you to do everything for them.

At some point they have to do for themselves and not rely on you to handle everything. With a baby and your own mental health issues your husband isn't even being considerate of his wife nor his young children. \nSecondly, this sounds like a recipe for disaster. Does his sister have a job lined up? How long will she be living with you before she gets her own place or move in with someone else? Will she be an issue with you raising your children or possibly interfere with your parenting? And it sounds like she will very much be dependant on you like his family already is.

Talk to an attorney about the best way to separate, move 50% of money from joint accounts into your own account and find out if you have to move or does he.

Does he care for you or value you beyond the work you do for his family?", "No, I don't love him. I think he only loves what I do and not me as a person.

If yes this responsibility comes with a significant financial obligation for her for like 10 years +.", "NTA but you need to be prepared that he might call your bluff. I hope you have a place to go because if he brings her over and you don\u2019t follow through with leaving? Well, get used to not mattering because you\u2019ve just handed over your last bit of leverage.", "NTA, and importantly - does \u2018arranging the visa\u2019 also mean sponsoring her to live?   Because if so, at least in the US there are financial requirements with sponsoring family for immigration status. Something like being legally responsible for their living expenses for 10 years. Not sure if this is what is happening, but if you are married you are also legally liable. \n\nIt\u2019s not right for your husband to decide all of this with absolutely no input or support from you. You have a very serious husband problem here. Do you have friends you can go to for support?", "Thank you", "She never said she didn\u2019t have any family to go to.\n\nedit: Sorry just saw OP\u2019s follow up that she doesn\u2019t have family to go to.

Without new visas, they are here illegally. \n\nIf your BILs are not citizens, they are not able to sponsor your SIL. \n\nIs your husband a citizen? If not, **he\u2019s setting you up as the sponsor for his sister**. This would make you personally responsible to provide her a home and support her financially. \n\n**Refuse to sign any legal documents, applications, etc.**\n\nI think you need to talk to a lawyer yesterday. \n\nIs your husband\u2019s visa dependent upon being married to you? Is it possible he used you for a visa? If the answer to either is yes, see a lawyer immediately. \n\nIf you can\u2019t afford a lawyer, reach out to legal aid or, better yet, a women\u2019s shelter. I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re being used by your husband to get visas for his family. This puts you and your children at risk.", "Here is where I may be the asshole. \n\nI believe anyone that's going to a different country and doesn't speak the language should either start learning how to speak the language at least simple sentences OR  pay for a translator at all times... Even if it's just electronic translator...\n\n\nIf I went to another country I would either have to pay for a translator, electric or person, or I would need to be learning the language.

You can do this!", "NTA....have a plan in place, and STOP doing stuff for his family", "Because maybe I'm being the asshole for not letting someone from a poor, war torn country come and stay in my home.

Every good wish.", "What difference does it make?", "She literally just has in her comment above.", "Her life is pretty rubbish and unstable over there", "OP, investigate women's shelters. This sounds like a dangerous, abusive situation , since your husband has no respect for you. Is there any way you can contact immigration or the visa office and tell them you do NOT want your SIL living with you and will not sign any documents? Could you ask them not to tell your husband, because you're afraid of him and his brothers? At any rate, check out women's shelters. There may very well be a way to leave.", "NTA. But you don't have a sister in law problem, you have a husband AH problem.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re in a terrible situation. I hope you can find somewhere safe for you and your children to go.", "NTA. You need an entire new life. Like one without this husband and his family. Good luck. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be leaving because he seems to not respect you and think you\u2019re his secretary.", "NTA.  You should definitely make him your EX-husband, because it sounds like he doesn\u2019t give a damn about you.", "NTA your husband is being completely unreasonable. You need to be smart and build an exit plan.", "NTA. It sounds like your husband and his family are using you. There's no reason you should have to do all of the work for his family and your own. If I were you I'd get out ASAP.", "NTA.  Your husband needs to step up and put you first.   You are not slave labor, but his partner, and should be able to say what goes on in YOUR home.", "NTA. I would be talking to your family or whoever can help you to get out of there.", "NTA - but what visa is your husband organizing for her? There is no visitor\u2019s visa that allows her to stay for an undisclosed amount of time. Is the plan for her to overstay her visa and remain in the US?", "Have you ever questioned if he married you for ulterior motives?", "Did you, by chance, happen to help your husband get citizenship?", "NTA and this is your hill to die on.", "And honestly maybe a divorce lawyer?\n\nHubby doesn\u2019t seem to care about the health and well being of his wife as much as how much she can help his family out. I am making assumptions, but I am guessing he is a part of the reasons OP has mental health issues.", "I've stated to him directly that I believe he did, which he of course refutes.", "No, he got it in his own right after sufficient time with a valid visa, permanent residency, etc.", "NTA. Even if you were perfectly healthy with no kids, if  you don\u2019t want her moving in, then that is that. Doesn\u2019t matter if she is your husband\u2019s sister.\n\nYour home is your safe space and where you can decompress. Bringing in an adult into your space to live, even for a short span of time, is a big ask for anyone because the house dynamics will shift drastically. Also, you\u2019re probably not around your SIL often so she\u2019s more than likely a virtual stranger to you.\n\nIf she had a place and needed somewhere to crash for a week or two, then yes I\u2019d say just let her stay because she has plans for elsewhere. But any longer than that? She can get a hotel or AirBnB. But, wanting her to move in for an undisclosed amount of time is a big hell no. She could move in and just stay.\n\nWhile your husband is ok with it, you\u2019re not. He needs to respect your boundaries. Say no and hold your ground. If people get pissed, let them. If she shows up to move in, that is the day you should move out as well. I\u2019d go ahead and start saving money and looking into arrangements for yourself and kids if she pops up.", "I hope for your sake this was not the case however I do think it will be beneficial for you and your children if you are able to promptly remove yourself (and them) from this situation before he moves his sister in. It\u2019s very sad when you love someone, but if he won\u2019t put you and the children first, then someone has to. I saw someone had suggested reaching out to a womens aid type of place and seeking help and potentially asking for their help to get you out of the situation you\u2019re currently stuck in. Even if you\u2019re not ready to make such drastic decisions, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to know your local resources if such an occasion was to occur. I wish you and your children a happy and healthy future", "You answered directly to OP."]}
