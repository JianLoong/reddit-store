I was all set for a YTA but as your niece has been treated for an eating disorder I get why you are concerned. Have an open and frank conversation with your sister about your concerns, and see if you can have a similar conversation with your niece. She may already be aware and whilst shopping for a dress may find other dressmakers not so sympathetic or know your niece\u2019s background - so actually may want you to do it because you know the issues. Open, honest but constructive discussions are needed here.", "NAH. I think you should talk to B's mother (or her sister if they're closer) to ask if they think she can handle this line of questioning, or if they (A or mother) may know the answers well enough to inform you of them. If you're willing, you could probably also find some resources online or something to help to find better ways to discuss and / or handle this situation. Ignore these thoughts if it really is too daunting to take these extra steps, but, in the event you do really want to this to for her while also being conscientious of how to not poke any eating disorder / body image triggers, perhaps you can find a way.", "Don\u2019t say any of that to niece or her mom, it\u2019s only going to make things worse. \n\nJust say you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to make a dress for her.

That\u2019s stupidly cheeky. There was no polite request or anything? TBH just for that don\u2019t make the thing for the entitled little monster. Wow.", "Why don't you just tell them you don't have the bandwidth? After you did it the first time, you promised yourself 'never again' because it took too much out of you. It's okay that you did it during covid, but those restrictions aren't the case now.", "NTA I would just simply say that when you made the sisters dress that it was during a pandemic when most people worked from home and went no where.\n\nLet them know that now your job requires you to be more hands on and you have a life outside of work that takes up your life.\n\nYour neice sounds very entitled to just assume you\u2019re making her dress. She didn\u2019t ask she just demanded.", "NTA. Managing business and family is tough, on the one hand it doesn't feel right to just treat them like a regular client but on the other hand you can get taken advantage of. Try to establish some middle ground policy for family (my brother gives a set discount for family but otherwise treats you like one of his clients)", "Could you make a dress that can be tightened and than make it a fraction bigger so it will fit either way. This way you can avoid the conversation as you are right, it is not a conversation you should be having with someone with an eating disorder. Don't make this about her weight make it about design. NTA", "YTA. I think you need to decide if you\u2019re ever going to make a wedding dress again. If you made it for her sister and not her, I could see how niece B might feel a certain way. If you say that you cannot make a wedding dress for niece B, then when niece C comes along asking, you have to say no too.", "NAH. I totally get where you are coming from, it\u2019s a tricky situation to navigate and obviously her being a family member the last thing you want to do is trigger her.\n\nHowever, I can see why she\u2019d be hurt. Is it worth an open conversation with her and her mum (or, if her mum is not appropriate, someone supportive and actively involved in her recovery journey) of what it would entail and your concerns?", "So I'm going to go with gentle YTA. You are making a lot of assumptions about your niece and her recovery without having information.\n\nYou are obviously not obligated to make anyone a dress but it sounds like you would make your niece one but for her eating disorder, which she is in recovery from. That really sucks to single her out for that. Personally I would try to find out if there is a way I can feel comfortable making her a dress without feeling the anxiety of accidentally triggering her.\n\nI assume she is working with a therapist and a treatment team. I would say to your sister you are really bummed that you don't know if you have the bandwidth to build a dress from scratch right now and you also know how stressful the whole wedding dress thing is for the bride and you worry you will trigger her. Ask if you can have a conversation with her team and then express your concerns to her team. It could be as simple as changing the term you use for some things or when you guys do fitting she has to bring a therapist with her to translate your dress making questions to no there is nothing wrong with your body but unless you want to wear a sack your aunt needs hip measurements or letting out a seam doesn't mean you are fat it means something didn't work quite as well on an actual human body as it did on paper and a dress form. If your niece won't let you talk to her team and get some assurances on your concern or if her team makes some suggestions for her protection and your niece isn't willing to follow then I think it's an easy I want to make you a dress but I want you alive and healthy more. Of I can't talk to your team about this specific thing/you can't follow the plan, then I'm not going to risk your health. \n\nNo one can reasonably call you the bad guy if you take that approach. You'd be making an expert informed decision with expert approved safeguards.", "NAH. It was reasonable of her to assume you'd make her dress, and she probably isn't aware of the issues that would entail. You're also fully justified in your reservations due to said issues. \n\nThis is nothing a couple adult conversations won't resolve.", "I'd understand if your reason was simply 'i don't have the time or energy' - no one is entitled to your labour. But your reasoning here is strange. Are you saying your other niece doesn't have a model's body so you don't want to make a dress that won't look as good on her as it does on the model niece? Because...I mean, she knows she's had an eating disorder, it's clearly no secret...and she's an adult who I assume is aware that fluctuations in size affect whatever dress you'll be making. Why the awkwardness? You're her aunt, I would think you could have open conversations about these things (respectfully).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also when you described making your Niece A\u2019s dress you said she is stunning and could be a model. You didn\u2019t need to add all this for your question of AITA. Niece B is going to have to get a dress somewhere and going to have to deal with these issues with someone else would it not be better coming from you? If you don\u2019t want to do it fine that does not make you an asshole but for the reasons you posted I think it does.", "NAH, and I get your concern but perhaps for that same reason you don't want to make the dress, is the same reason she shouldn't be going to a bridal salon where those same topics come up. A bridal salon likely isn't going to know this about her, and not handle it the way it should be. And you have the opportunity to support her and find a way to make this work. I also understand why she would want you to, and you aren't obligated to at all. I do think you might consider it at least a little.\n\nYou can sit down with her, talk about expectations, about the hard stuff, about setting boundaries, and stuff like that. Perhaps finding ways to accommodate weight fluctuation with minimal alterations needed (IE maybe a corset top?). And encouraging her to seek conversations with her therapist around this. You might even be able to help a little more here, because you have the compassion and desire to support her in this journey.", "NAH.  Regardless of your reasoning, I think you're totally screwed here.  The perception that you are biased toward the niece who, by your own admission, is so attractive she could be a model is inescapable.  Maybe you really do have a bias, maybe you don't.  Maybe your other niece is currently overweight, maybe she's currently underweight and perceives herself as too big.  There's no winning for you though, because even refusing could make someone with an eating disorder think you're judging them about their body.  \n\nPlus, you're correct about all the reasons you actually stated.  The only way to avoid this would have been to not make the dress for your other niece.  But there's no way you could have known.", "INFO: did you tell them that was why you couldn\u2019t make the dress?", "NAH the Pandemic indeed was a special situation, and you are under no obligation. However, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether your niece might get triggered by a seamstress who is clueless about her ED and wouldn\u2019t be so careful about what she says when making or altering her dress.", "YTA. Ask her support system how to best broach the subjects you are uncomfortable with.  I used to be balimic, so I know it is a sensitive subject, you are right to be cautious. I hope everything works out for your niece to feel as beautiful as her sister did on her wedding day.", "YTA - I\u2019m a home sewist and made a wedding gown for my niece. It took me tons of time. However, part of the reason it took so long was that I had quite the learning curve. If I had to do it again, I would be much faster. \n\nSince you were a Broadway costume designer, you have the skill set to make this gown in a reasonable amount of time.  You obviously also know ways to incorporate design elements such as pleats that allow for pre-wedding alterations. You also know that you can make a mock up now and sew the final garment close to her wedding date.\n\n It sounds like the only reason you don\u2019t want to do this is because of your niece\u2019s eating disorder.

I\u2019m almost feeling NAH because I think the neice made an assumption but not a crazy one. Focus on the fact that you had more time at home during the pandemic and no one could visit shops etc. Maybe you could offer to have your present to her be a nice veil or shawl that you make? \n\nIf you are close, and you want to get more real, talk to B (or C?) privately. Walk her through the what the process entails: measuring, fitting, discussing body size. Ask her if she\u2019d really be up for this? And with a wedding already a lot of pressure, would she feel pressured to stay at a size or change sizes because of the dress? I\u2019m in ED recovery, 10+ years now. I\u2019m also a seamstress. I STILL don\u2019t make myself clothes because of how stressful it is. I wouldn\u2019t welcome a convo like this from my aunt unless we were confidant-close, but maybe some folks would. I also bough a sundress off the rack for my wedding dress because I couldn\u2019t bear to fit/measure anything. \n\nED recovery is shit. And an ED will rear its head for years. Hugs to all of you.", "I disagree with you. Maybe op could discreetly let the mother know the kind of questions that the daughter will receive during her fittings, but I don\u2019t think it would be wise to get entangled into it honestly.", "Maybe OP could offer to make the veil, or embellish the finished base dress (that someone else can do the fittings and alterations and have the hard conversations) if she is willing to put in some work but not \"entire gown from scratch including ED responsive gentle handholding\" amounts of work", "The best answer.", "There are some ways to make clothing more adjustable (lace up vs a zipper) but it depends on what design the bride wants and what range of sizes we are talking about.\n\nNote that OP is a singular person and works a job. They are likely going to need a longer timeline then dedicated bridal shops. This means there is more possibility from start to finish of a larger weight change. Bridal also usually means many layers and decorations and attention to detail.\n\nSo if the bride wants a form fitting mermaid dress that zips up then that is not going to have much weight fluctuation range. If they want a flowy empire dress and they don't vary much in the bust then that might be more reasonable. Also with the form fitting and sometimes the transparent layers, having large seam allowances may take away from the look. With embroidery or other details you may not be able to take in a seam or let it out without misalignment of the pattern match.\n\nSo I would say the answer is kinda, depending, to a certain extent.  I haven't done bridal, I just sew clothes.\n\nAlso, not sure which way their ED journey is going but if they are healthily gaining weight, they may have issues with suddenly being larger than they were, even if it wasn't healthy before. Having a high pressure \"best dress of your life\" type of thing going on may be difficult emotionally and can possibly cause some upsetness at OP that they don't look they way they did or if they need a larger size to look their best, it can be a triggering moment.", "If she's gonna do that she may as well make her the dress.  The conversation about \"I don't think you can handle this because of your eating disorder\" would be just as triggering.", "It doesn\u2019t solve anything, but op is allowed to say no for whatever reason she wants to. Niece will have to have the conversations anyway, she had a therapist she can work through this with.", "This would be great advice, except the Niece never ASKED OP if she would make her a wedding dress.  She contacted her & asked when she'd be able to do the fitting, etc.... \n\n\nAt that level of assumptive rudeness, OP is certainly NTA by just saying \"no\".", "[deleted]", "She literally said that the weight *fluctuations*, and their underlying psychological cause, are the problem.\n\nWeight and body type are not what make creating a custom gown difficult. Constant alterations, some of which might be impossible without completely starting over, are the challenge here. And if the bride can\u2019t handle discussing necessary alterations that touch on her weight, it would take OP\u2019s job from \u201cdifficult\u201d to \u201ccompletely impossible.\u201d  She can\u2019t ensure that the dress fits correctly and comfortably unless she can physically put the dress on the bride and talk to her about what\u2019s needed, and without the bride\u2019s knowledge and cooperation, she can\u2019t make changes to the dress. \n\nThis is true whether the dress is off-the-rack, made to order, or customized from the start. If you can\u2019t have honest conversations about your body with the person whose job it is to make sure the dress *fits* your body, then they can\u2019t do their job.", "C is OPs sister.", "If op is making the dress she can say no for whatever reason she wants. She\u2019s putting in all the work on top of her usual work, she knows it\u2019s going to be a struggle and triggering for niece no matter WHAT she does, she\u2019s allowed to say no. Niece can find seamstresses and bridal salons who do this everyday and deal with it there, she felt entitled to a dress hand made which was also incorrect.", "NTA\n\nLetting the mother know is the textbook definition of getting entangled in it.", "She's not required to go to a bridal salon. She could buy a dress off the rack that already fits or is a stretchy fabric that could fit her at many sizes.", "She\u2019s not entitled to a dress from anyone, she\u2019ll get the dress she wants at a salon and deal with the fittings then. There\u2019s nothing anyone can do to help with that even if they\u2019re family or not, you can\u2019t make everyone comfortable all the time. The niece expected a dress from OP, op has the right to say no for whatever reason she so pleases.", "Even the discussion of where a dress style can and cannot be altered could be problematic. My mom also used to be a dressmaker in her youth, and she was very clear in her explanations with different styles. And by clear, I mean she switched into dressmaker mode, not mom mode. Absolutely nothing mean or ill intentioned, just straightforward. Like \"This dress has a lot of beading and detail around the hip. That means you can't gain any weight, because there is no way to let this area out. If you lose a little weight, it'll be ok because of the shape, but you can't lose more than a couple pounds or it'll hang off you. So if you want this dress, you need to be strict with yourself and not change weight\". \n\nThat's a perfectly reasonable conversation to have with most people, because you need to understand if a dress can be altered and where. But that can be incredibly harmful to someone still working through an eating disorder. It's not personal, it's simply how the dress is, but it can feel personal.", "I might get downvoted for this, but I'm going with YTA. \n\nI can't imagine an aunt who loved their neice would say no simply because they had an eating disorder. If the reasons the OP had given were that she was now working full-time on-site at work again and no longer had the free time to sew, I might have bought that excuse. But they are claiming they can't make a dress because they don't want to have a conversation. If they had said it was because they didn't like that the second neice expected a dress rather than asked for a dress, I would have understood that as well. Even if you had said that doing it once was fun, but knowing now how much time and effort it would be to do it again is just too overwhelming, but you didn't say that either. You said it is because she has an eating disorder.\n\nI chose YTA because of the way this was written, telling us all of the reasons we should favor one neice (model beautiful) and not the other (pushy and anorexic) to try to sway us to side with the OP's decision to refuse to make a dress for the second. You've told us that in your judgment, one of them deserves a dress and the other doesn't.\n\nJust own it. You like one of your neices more than the other. And that means their mother is correct and YTA for showing such clear favoritism.\n\nAnd yes, I agree with others that you need to lie and make up a work-related excuse because telling your neice anything that betrays your true judgmental feelings would be a horrific thing to do to someone who is obviously already struggling emotionally.", "YTA. You can't do for one niece and not the other without better reasoning than an eating disorder.\n\nDo you have a colleague you could refer her to and offer to pay a portion of her dress? Just say you don't have the time, but you can still be a part of it in that way. Maybe help with the beading.\n\nBetter yet, can someone else do the measurements and have those discussions with her instead of you?", "No one is the AH. You don\u2019t need to make the dress (but please don\u2019t say it is because of her eating disorder). On the other hand she can feel disappointed that you are not making her a dress like her sister got (assuming sister could be cousins) Family is complicated with lots of baggage. The baggage may not be about op but between A and B. It would be nice if you could find away to do something for B. If not a dress something just as a gesture that you care.", "NTA - making a custom garment is incredibly intimate.  You will be up in her space during fittings and measurements, you will be having diet and weight discussions as you get nearer the date.  You don\u2019t want to add an extra stressor (and potential relapse trigger) to her wedding prep - kinda dangerous to tell people recovering from ED\u2019s \u2018hey, so, now that our fitting is done - I need you to not lose or gain weight as best as possible before the wedding\u2019\n\n(For people unfamiliar with making clothing) That being said\u2026 traditional wedding dresses aren\u2019t that hard to make - outerwear is harder IMO. Princess Seam gowns/bodices are easy to modify and often made with large seam allowances to allow for alteration.  The wedding trends at the time I was in school were all very minimalistic in silhouette with finishing and embellishments being the key factors - and I refuse to keep up with the Wedding Industrial Complex (if you are buying anything wedding related that is not CLEARLY for a wedding, lie.  Prices will change if they find out weddings are involved, almost exclusively going up.  When I was in school, we discussed that the wedding dress industry has the one of the highest profit margins per garment in the whole apparel industry)", "NAH. \n\nI can see why she would want you to design a dress since she\u2019s probably been looking forward to it since she saw her sister\u2019s. This is an overstep but it\u2019s understandable. \n\nI can see why the specific circumstances make this impossible for you right now. \n\nI think you should tell her the reasons others have given about how the pandemic made it something accessible then that just isn\u2019t now. \n\nYou should tell your sister that and also give her a heads up that niece might need extra emotional support during the dress shopping and altering experiences.", "She's an adult, have the uncomfortable conversation with her. as in let her know you will HAVE to talk about her weight, body etc.   If you don't want to make the dress say you are simply too busy", "NTA. Maybe tell them you have no way to get luxury material this time around?", "Some of you don't seem to understand the amount of effort that goes into bridal wear. There is a huge reason why brides go on diets so they can fit in their dresses, many of them being crash diets because the stress of the planning has made their diets go haywire. Most of the fabrics involved are spendy and delicate, and cannot be at the mercy of a seam ripper repeatedly, if at all. There are also more intricate seams involved (ie, princess). And depending on the style, more in-depth measurements are needed. If someone's weight is constantly fluctuating, it puts stress on the bride, seamstress, and materials, and eventually, they're all going to fray. I personally refuse to work as a seamstress in the bridal industry. I'll stick with costuming. (I went off-the-rack in something that didn't need alterations when I got married because I have always struggled with my weight, I was struggling more with trying to keep it to military standards, and I didn't have the time or money to make my dress myself.)", "OP, you can tell them that making the other dress brought back memories of why you no longer work as a seamstress. You simply will not make the dress for her.  If you give them a lot of reasons, it will simply diffuse the argument.  Then you have discussions about cost, timing, fitting, emotional baggage\u2026. In the end, the reason is that you don\u2019t want to. You no longer are a professional seamstress and you do not want to make her dress.", "NTA-\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to tell her it\u2019s because of her eating disorder maybe say you don\u2019t have the time? Or explain it was because it was during a pandemic where nothing was open for A to get the dress fitted? \n\nI completely get why you don\u2019t want to tell her the real reason though as eating disorders are tough especially trying to talk about your weight and could trigger her deeply,You could possibly speak to B\u2019s mum about your concerns?", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t say anything about the ED. Tell her you are so sorry but with work you don\u2019t have the time to make a full wedding dress. her sister got lucky during the pandemic because you had very little going on then but now that the world is back on you just can\u2019t.\n\nPerhaps you can offer to make her veil as a peace offering?", "NTA - I love the presumption of B (& C) to just assume it was a done deal. B just called to ask about a fitting rather than, \"hey Auntie OP, I love what you did for A, is there any chance you could please do the same for me?\"\n\nSeriously though, as with the previous comments, don't mention the eating disorder, just say you had the time during covid since you were working from home and no one was hiring, but don't now that things are back hybrid/in-person. \n\nThat C & B feels OP is an AH for refusing just goes to show that no good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA, but you need to be kind.\n\nMaking a wedding gown is MAJOR.  You don't have time now.  Skip the other reasons about the bride's eating disorcer.\n\nSUGGESTION:  MAKE THE WEDDING VEIL!!!", "NTA, and I admire your thoughtfulness. \n\nI also am a sewist, and have altered several bridal gowns, etc. Weight fluctuation is a very real main topic of discussion. \n\nI have to have the conversation. Maybe, if that\u2019s the only reason you are hesitant, take the time to chat with the bride to be. Maybe she has gotten herself in order and the problems you\u2019re expecting won\u2019t be an issue.", "NTA\n\n\"B, I'm flattered you thought to hire me to make your wedding dress!  I don't have the time available like I did during the pandemic.  Luckily, you have all the dress shops open.\" \n\nIt's rude that she just assumed, and dealing with the minefield of emotions is better left to strangers.", "Just a thought... while I understand your reasons for being reluctant to do it, could you make the dress so it could be taken in or out? Like a bra has several hook and eye closures... could you have those going all the way down the bodice? That way, it could be taken in or let out as she gains or loses weight...", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t like when people assume that others are willing to take on huge projects for them because it was done for someone else. That alone would be enough for me to say no. Ask. Don\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m doing. I crochet, so I have a real issue with that kind of entitlement.", ">I don\u2019t have the bandwidth\u2026\n\nWe use \"Capacity\" because we work in Agile Sprints.  Same diff!", "The why for the no is the issue.\n\nI will say when I started the post I was prepared to side with OP, however, niece was very upfront with how can we work around your time and what funds do you need from me. That leads me to believe that there was a implied, intended or not, expectation that OP loved making the dress for her niece and this would become a tradition. \n\nFrom everything OP has said she would do this again but for concerns about triggering her niece's eating disorder. That is a very valid concern but just saying no without seeing if it is feasible to make a dress without triggering her is an AH move.\n\nAnd if the facts were different, if OP just didn't have the time or if the cost would be more or OP isn't close with this niece/sister, that is a totally different analysis, and not what OP asked.\n\nOP asked if they are an AH for not making their niece's wedding dress because OP is worried it could trigger her eating disorder. And for saying no without taking the steps in my original response OP is a gentle AH. It came from a place of caring but is still a AH move.", "She doesn't KNOW any of this. She's assuming.  If she doesn't want to make the dress just say you're too busy.  This is a stupid excuse", "It\u2019s obviously going to be a struggle. ED recovery is a struggle for the victim and those who support the victim. She doesn\u2019t even have to know it, she\u2019s allowed to say no for whatever she wants to. Whether it be bc she doesn\u2019t like her hair or bc it\u2019ll be a long task, doesn\u2019t matter in the end bc she can say no. The niece can find a professional whose whole job is sewing and finding dresses and pay them."]}
