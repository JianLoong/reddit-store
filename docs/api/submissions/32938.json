I was all set for a YTA but as your niece has been treated for an eating disorder I get why you are concerned. Have an open and frank conversation with your sister about your concerns, and see if you can have a similar conversation with your niece. She may already be aware and whilst shopping for a dress may find other dressmakers not so sympathetic or know your niece\u2019s background - so actually may want you to do it because you know the issues. Open, honest but constructive discussions are needed here.", "NAH. I think you should talk to B's mother (or her sister if they're closer) to ask if they think she can handle this line of questioning, or if they (A or mother) may know the answers well enough to inform you of them. If you're willing, you could probably also find some resources online or something to help to find better ways to discuss and / or handle this situation. Ignore these thoughts if it really is too daunting to take these extra steps, but, in the event you do really want to this to for her while also being conscientious of how to not poke any eating disorder / body image triggers, perhaps you can find a way.", "Don\u2019t say any of that to niece or her mom, it\u2019s only going to make things worse. \n\nJust say you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to make a dress for her. You work in corporate, buzzword them to death \ud83d\ude06", "NTA, did your niece just assume you would make the dress, like that\u2019s prob like 6 months worth of work with all your free time. That\u2019s stupidly cheeky. There was no polite request or anything? TBH just for that don\u2019t make the thing for the entitled little monster. Wow.", "Why don't you just tell them you don't have the bandwidth? After you did it the first time, you promised yourself 'never again' because it took too much out of you. It's okay that you did it during covid, but those restrictions aren't the case now.", "NTA I would just simply say that when you made the sisters dress that it was during a pandemic when most people worked from home and went no where.\n\nLet them know that now your job requires you to be more hands on and you have a life outside of work that takes up your life.\n\nYour neice sounds very entitled to just assume you\u2019re making her dress. She didn\u2019t ask she just demanded.", "NTA. Managing business and family is tough, on the one hand it doesn't feel right to just treat them like a regular client but on the other hand you can get taken advantage of. Try to establish some middle ground policy for family (my brother gives a set discount for family but otherwise treats you like one of his clients)", "Could you make a dress that can be tightened and than make it a fraction bigger so it will fit either way. This way you can avoid the conversation as you are right, it is not a conversation you should be having with someone with an eating disorder. Don't make this about her weight make it about design. NTA", "YTA. I think you need to decide if you\u2019re ever going to make a wedding dress again. If you made it for her sister and not her, I could see how niece B might feel a certain way. If you say that you cannot make a wedding dress for niece B, then when niece C comes along asking, you have to say no too.", "NAH. I totally get where you are coming from, it\u2019s a tricky situation to navigate and obviously her being a family member the last thing you want to do is trigger her.\n\nHowever, I can see why she\u2019d be hurt. Is it worth an open conversation with her and her mum (or, if her mum is not appropriate, someone supportive and actively involved in her recovery journey) of what it would entail and your concerns?", "So I'm going to go with gentle YTA. You are making a lot of assumptions about your niece and her recovery without having information.\n\nYou are obviously not obligated to make anyone a dress but it sounds like you would make your niece one but for her eating disorder, which she is in recovery from. That really sucks to single her out for that. Personally I would try to find out if there is a way I can feel comfortable making her a dress without feeling the anxiety of accidentally triggering her.\n\nI assume she is working with a therapist and a treatment team. I would say to your sister you are really bummed that you don't know if you have the bandwidth to build a dress from scratch right now and you also know how stressful the whole wedding dress thing is for the bride and you worry you will trigger her. Ask if you can have a conversation with her team and then express your concerns to her team. It could be as simple as changing the term you use for some things or when you guys do fitting she has to bring a therapist with her to translate your dress making questions to no there is nothing wrong with your body but unless you want to wear a sack your aunt needs hip measurements or letting out a seam doesn't mean you are fat it means something didn't work quite as well on an actual human body as it did on paper and a dress form. If your niece won't let you talk to her team and get some assurances on your concern or if her team makes some suggestions for her protection and your niece isn't willing to follow then I think it's an easy I want to make you a dress but I want you alive and healthy more. Of I can't talk to your team about this specific thing/you can't follow the plan, then I'm not going to risk your health. \n\nNo one can reasonably call you the bad guy if you take that approach. You'd be making an expert informed decision with expert approved safeguards.", "NAH. It was reasonable of her to assume you'd make her dress, and she probably isn't aware of the issues that would entail. You're also fully justified in your reservations due to said issues. \n\nThis is nothing a couple adult conversations won't resolve.", "I'd understand if your reason was simply 'i don't have the time or energy' - no one is entitled to your labour. But your reasoning here is strange. Are you saying your other niece doesn't have a model's body so you don't want to make a dress that won't look as good on her as it does on the model niece? Because...I mean, she knows she's had an eating disorder, it's clearly no secret...and she's an adult who I assume is aware that fluctuations in size affect whatever dress you'll be making. Why the awkwardness? You're her aunt, I would think you could have open conversations about these things (respectfully).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
