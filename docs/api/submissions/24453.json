Both of my parents were single, and they had 50/50 custody, so no one was running around claiming to be a single parent because they weren\u2019t raising children on their own. There was indeed another involved parent regardless of the fact that they weren\u2019t together. \n\nIt sounds like this guy is intentionally milking the connotation of \u201csingle father\u201d so people will fluff up is ego and tell him how wonderful he is. Especially since he\u2019s going on about \u201chow hard it is\u201d, clearly he\u2019s not just referring to being a father who happens to be single. The way you say he spoke about it, it\u2019s clear he wants to capitalize off of sympathy for a situation he isn\u2019t actually experiencing.", "NTA. Single dad complaining about how hard it is = earned, if the dad is doing all the hard work on his own. He\u2019s not doing it on his own. They\u2019re splitting responsibilities. And less than half!!! \n\nIn my opinion, the semantics here are being used BY the dad to his advantage. He\u2019s using stolen valor and getting away with it with semantics LOL\n\nThe single in single dad is doing it by yourself, singularly. Single in single dad doesn\u2019t refer to relationship status\u2026 only does when talking about relationship status. Which he is not, because he\u2019s complaining about doing it in his own. Which he\u2019s not\u2026\u2026.\n\nThis isn\u2019t my opinion, google it yall.", "NTA. Single parent: ONE parent. The only parent.", "NTA. He sounds like a single dad in a similar way to Kim Kardashian calling herself a single mom. I tend to think of a single parent as a sole parent and provider, the other parent absent. That is imo though, clearly others feel differently.", "NTA. I used to define a single parent in relation to their responsibilities, as someone who raises their child without the presence of the other parent. Now I can understand why some people define it i relation to their relationships status, as a parent not in relationship. I guess just keep that in mind, that everyone defines it differently", "NTA\n\nYou're right. He is not a single dad.", "Sharing custody doesn\u2019t make him less of a dad and single means not married, separated, or divorced. It\u2019s more of a pet peeve for me when a guy says he\u2019s single but he\u2019s actually still married, separated, or divorced.", "When I here single mom or single dad. I think they are the only ones taking care of the child. NTA", "NTA. My mum was a single mum. My dad was the every other weekend dad. Mum did all the parenting, all the school and sports activities, all the shopping and planning and organising it takes to raise a kid. Dad paid the bare minimum child support and was happy to brag about the private education mum put us through, but was not happy to help pay it.\n\nThis guy you're dating seriously fails to understand what raising a child takes. He's divorced from reality if he thinks being *single* and being a *dad* makes him a single dad. Honestly? I couldn't date someone like this, someone who speaks like they carry a heavy burden but is only actively parenting less than 15% of the time.", "NAH. Your definition of a single parent is a parent that\u2019s raising their kids alone. His definition is a parent that\u2019s single. Both definitions have validity. My question to you is why does it bother you so much how someone else chooses to label themselves? It doesn\u2019t affect you in any way. You\u2019ve only been dating this guy for a month. You don\u2019t know the full extent of his parenting situation and how it came to be that way. You should have waited until you knew all of the details of his situation before you made an assessment of it.", "How much do you know about the other parent? My dad and mother divorced and my dad had primary custody. He made sure me and my brother were taken care of. We still visited our mom on the weekends and she didn\u2019t do any parenting her parents ( my grandparents) did.", "NTA", "NTA, but every \u201cdivorced with kids\u201d friend I have considers herself a single mom regardless of the involvement of the children\u2019s father. Calling them out as not \u201creal\u201d single moms would be offensive to them as it diminishes what they go through on a daily basis, trying to navigate raising children primarily alone.", "NTA since you didn\u2019t outright tell him he\u2019s wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t assume single parent to be synonymous with solo parent.  His relationship status and parental status makes him a single dad.  I doubt he would make different relationship decisions regarding partners solely based on the number of days a month he has his child 100%.", "YTA", "YTA. He is a dad. He is single. That makes him a single dad.\n\nIt's not a competition about \"Oh if you don't have it as bad as X, you can't call yourself a single dad\". Sure, some have it better and others have it worse, but they are all single dads at the end of the day.\n\nYou're letting this affect you way more than it should. Him being in a more favourable situation than your dad's doesn't take away any of your dads accomplishments. At the same time, you shouldn't belittle his difficulties and challenges just because your dad had it worse.", "Wow, there's a lot of people here caught up in semantics, including OP. Would you prefer to call him a divorced dad, OP? When I got divorced, I had my children 50% of the time. Would you N T A's have considered me only 1/2 of a single dad? If you can't agree on the definition, OP, then don't date him. Personally, I think this is petty, but it is your choice. I am going to give you NAH, because we all have our preferences.\n\nAnd to be petty at you OP, the expression is \"skin in the game.\"", "NAH- but it isn\u2019t up to you to determine whether or not he\u2019s a single dad. As you said- he\u2019s single, and he\u2019s a father. \n\nMy mother considered herself a single mom when we were kids. She had 4 kids, 3 different dads. 2 from the first dad, then 1 and 1. On that info- would you consider her a single mom?\n\nNow let\u2019s throw in that she chose not to be the custodial parent to the first three. My older sibling and I lived with our dad, middle sibling lived with their dad. The only reason she raised our youngest sibling is because that father specifically said he wasn\u2019t about to be a full time dad. \n\nAny parent who takes care of their kids alone due to death, a split, or divorce, is a single parent. It doesn\u2019t matter how that time is split.", "It doesn't sound like it. You didn't flat out tell him he wasn't,  right? You more hinted at it. Sounds pretty polite to me.", "YTA .... He's single and he's a dad.  By definition he's a single dad.  What makes you think you get to redefine what a single parent is?", "YTA.  This is potato vs potatoes.  \n\nEven if she has the kids 80% of the time, it does not diminish the 20% of his time, and he is single and a dad after all, no?  \n\nNext time you want to split hairs; go to a barber.", "Yta. Why do you care how other people define and describe themselves? People can give themselves whatever label they want to and I don\u2019t think his label was wrong either. He is single and he is a dad so he can say he is a single dad, that is the definition, an unmarried parent. Being unmarried and a parent isn\u2019t changed by how often your kids are in your home or how much money or time you spend on them, that is what makes you a good dad and he never claimed to be that whether he is or isn\u2019t.", "YTA. Idk what your problem was with him. He\u2019s not in a relationship and he\u2019s a father. He\u2019s a single dad. \n\nWould you press on with this had you been talking to a woman, who described herself as a single mom under the same circumstances?", "The word \"single\" in \"single dad\" does not have to mean the same thing as \"single\" in \"single mom.\"  For him, it seems to mean \"a dad who does not get to see his children as often as he might like.\"\n\nAs an armchair linguist, I have two things to say about this:  \n1) Normally, I am not a prescriptivist who says that a person must use terms in the ways that match other people's definition.  But when the term is \"loaded\" culturally or politically, I can be convinced.  For example, I might be convinced that \"single mom\" should only be used in the sense that you want to use it in.\n\nBut 2) \"Single dad\" has no such commonly accepted meaning.  There is no accepted widespread definition of \"single dad.\"  \n\n\nSo 3) I do think YTA a bit, because you're trying to prescribe a definition that does not really exist.  You're over applying a rule which you grabbed from \"single mom\" and insisting it must apply to \"single dad\".  But it doesn't.  \n\n\nI get your meaning, I get why it frustrates you, but you don't know what this guy deals with in his relationship with his children, in his status as a \"single dad.\"  Do not write it off simply because it is not the same as your own father's \"single dadness.\"  That does not make it any less valid.", "I agree with you. \"single dad\" and \"single mom\" to me imply solo parent, not just parent who is single.", "NTA. My husband\u2019s ex used to whine constantly about how hard it was to be a single mom, when she only saw her kids every other weekend and half of those times she got someone else to watch them so she could go party.", "If a man only has his kids every other weekend, then what he should be complaining about is how hard it is having his kids *so infrequently*. How he wants to see them more, to actually be able to take care of them.  Since they wasnt what he was doing, NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Regardless of how many dates you had, it\u2019s still not long enough for him to feel comfortable sharing the more personal details of his parenting situation with you.

Good luck.", "Right, so I guess I don't really understand your point. Of course it would be patently strange for you to question your friends' single mom status, precisely *because* they're performing the lion's share of the work. OP's boyfriend is *not* \"trying to navigate raising children primarily alone.\" Your friends all qualify along the lines of judgment laid out in the post: whether or not you agree that it's somewhat phony to present yourself as bearing the burdens of single parenthood when you, well, aren't. You even note that your friends are aware that they are themselves \"raising children primarily alone,\" so it sounds like they are quite literally *not* considering their single-mom status *regardless* of the involvement of the father; sounds like the burden proportion is actually *very* much regarded in the calculation here.", "If the other parent is active and present in their child\u2019s life, doesn\u2019t that mean that the primary custodial parent isn\u2019t raising their child alone?"]}
