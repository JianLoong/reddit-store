Last spring she started taking music classes with a theater company and her class had just a showcase. Everyone sang at least once, my kid sang 7 times. I will say that most of the singers were good but her teacher is an opera singer so a lot of the students sang musical theater or opera. My kid did musical theater, Italian Opera, pop, rock, and country. \n\nMy ex, her husband, their kids, my wife, and I went. My wife has a lot of the same interests as my daughter and, to be honest, she was the only one that enjoyed the concert. Yes, she's a good singer but we've all heard her sing everything she did there at home. The only difference is that we were all roped into driving a half hour to see her sing in a new dress with her hair and makeup professionally done (my wife insisted that she had to look perfect for her first concert) mixed in with a bunch of other kids that we couldn't care less about. \n\nAfter the concert she asked how I liked it and I was honest and told her that she was great but the concert was torture. She said \"well nobody forced you to go\", then later that night when my wife found out she tore into me for saying that to my daughter. Neither of them are talking to me right now but I think they're being dramatic so I wanted to see if I was the asshole", "created_utc": 1681873756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12repe6/aita_for_not_enjoying_my_daughters_concert/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Performing on a stage in front of dozens (potentially hundreds) of people takes a lot more courage and can be a lot more rewarding than singing at home. It was a new experience for your daughter, and I\u2019m sure she was really proud of herself for being able to truly perform and not just rehearse. The makeup and costume adds to the idea of it being an \u201cexperience\u201d, and you pretty much shot the whole thing down. I\u2019d apologize, and bring better energy to her next show, if she has one.", "YTA - You showed your daughter that you don\u2019t care to show up for her. She\u2019s right that no one forced you to go\u2026it\u2019d be better for you to not go at all than to go and bring her mood down. She doesn\u2019t need you there to dull her shine. If you can\u2019t appreciate her, her talents, her efforts, then go away.", "YTA, seriously? There's a time and a place to be honest. All you had to say was that she was great and that you're proud of her.", "YTA for expressing your \"torture\" to your daughter. You don't have to say everything to think and feel. You need to consider the audience (your daughter) and how they're going to receive your message. This was your daughter's first concert!? Congrats, she'll now have this as her lasting memory of the day that was supposed to be special to her. A positive \"I thought your singing was lovely.....\" would've been a better response. You didn't need to comment on the overall performance.", "YTA. Why couldn't you lie and act happy for your daughter? It clearly meant a lot to her and she didn't need you throwing how unhappy you were to be there in her face. We all have to do stuff we don't like sometimes just because it makes another person happy. Apologize to your daughter and your wife, ask how you can make this up to them.", "YTA. You had to drive a whole half hour to watch something your daughter obviously really cared about. I know people who drive their kids that far to school every day and manage not to make their kids feel bad about it. You should apologize.", "YTA. You immediately try to distort what happened in the title, which shows that you know on some level what you actually did here. Not enjoying a showcase by children doesn't make you an AH, it makes you a dad. Telling your daughter that going to her concert was torture makes you an AH, and is being a bad dad. You are supposed to be supportive and encourage her. It doesn't matter that you said she was good, you told her that going to support her was torture. Do you think she's going to interpret this as you being proud of her and excited about her accomplishments and talent? You essentially told her that you would have rather been anywhere else than supporting her, and you made her wish that you didn't come. This is heartbreaking. You express incredulity in your post about the whole night - I've heard her sing before, roped in, long drive, wife insisting she had to look perfect ... you don't even seem to understand what the point is because you're too busy wishing you were sitting on the couch instead. It isn't about you. No shit you didn't enjoy the show, they are kids not professionals, you are not there to be entertained. You are there to support and encourage your daughter. You failed. How you have not figured out such a basic aspect of fatherhood after 16 years is beyond me.", "YTA. It doesn't matter if you heard it a thousand times. It's different on stage in front of an audience. I understand where you are coming from. One of the best things about my son graduating is I never have to sit through a jazz concert again. But I never would have let him know I was anything less than proud of him.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t there to be entertained. You were there to support your daughter. When she asked whether you liked it, why could you just say, \u201cYou were great\u201d? Why couldn\u2019t you have told her you were proud of her? I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, though. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be invited to any more recitals.", "YTA. This is parenting.  You go and enjoy that your daughter is doing something she enjoys.", "YTA. Not for not liking the concert (I generally don\u2019t like them either), but for telling your daughter you didn\u2019t like the concert. I\u2019m actually surprised that you\u2019ve been a parent for at least 16 years and haven\u2019t learned how to fake enjoyment yet.", "YTA. Having been in your daughter\u2019s position I can say that she will not likely forget this, especially if you don\u2019t try to make amends. She will freeze you out from other things she does in the future because she will not want to ask you again. You will miss out on a lot that is important to her. The point isn\u2019t for you to enjoy the concert - it is for you to support your daughter doing something she is passionate and excited about. At least your wife understood the assignment. You have some remedial work to do.", "YTA - some things are better left unsaid. You were unsupportive and rude. Apologize ASAP.", "YTA\n\nDude just support your daughter and say, \u201cgreat job, honey. I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d", "Wow--so easy. A no-brainer. Absolutely YTA!! \n\nFirst of all for *saying* that the concert was torture, but secondly for *not enjoying* seeing your daughter all dressed up, on a stage in front of an audience, doing something she loves and that *other* people are getting pleasure from, even if it's not your thing.", "YTA, absolutely and without question.\n\nI get not liking school/class concerts. I didn't even like them when I was a kid. But that's not the point, you weren't there to LIKE the concert, you were there to support your child and something she's found that she's passionate about.\n\nWhen you told her that she was great but the concert was torture, what she really heard was \"this wasn't worth my time going to\". Which is essentially what you're saying to us. Took a whole half hour to drive there.  Had to sit through listening not only to a bunch of other kids but stuff you've already heard at home. Oh my, how absolutely terrible </sarcasm>\n\nThe evening wasn't about you, it was about your daughter, her passions, and what she's probably hoping will be a career for her.

Why even start a family ffs?", "YTA. What do you think your daughter heard when you said you didn't enjoy the concert?\n\nMost parents don't 100% enjoy activities their child participates in, but they do it because they love their child and want to support them. They don't tell their child how they didn't enjoy it. It isn't necessary to say that.", "YTA\u2026.definitely. Imagine being a child and finding a passion that they can\u2019t share with their parent because said parent finds going \u201ctorture\u201d. Shame on you.", "YTA- How much of a child do you have to be to complain about having to sit through a small concert, especially one where your daughter is performing? Comparing the concert to \u201ctorture\u201d is highly immature considering it seems to have inflicted no mental or physical harm to yourself, and instead got the experience of watching your daughter do something she loves.", "Not only are you the asshole, you win the award for being asshole of the year. That 30-minute drive must've been sooooo hard, and to think you then had to drive aaaaaalllll the way back. I'm surprised you didn't get a slap.", "YTA so badly... My dad had the same attitude as you with anything my sister did that involved concerts and recitals and the like. By the time she was in high school, she asked him to not attend because he wasn't enjoying it and it was making her upset. She is in her early 30s now and still has a hard time including our dad in anything because she is so afraid he is either:\n\n- doing it because he is obligated and lets us all know that. Continuously. \n\n- going to comment on what a waste of time it was for him after the fact. \n\n- question her every day if he \"really has to attend.\" \n\nAll you had to do was show up. Tell her she was great and you are proud of her and move on. It's really not that hard.", "YTA.

But she was there for me and was proud of me.  \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to tell your kid you\u2019re proud of them, they did a good job, you enjoyed what they did.

I would bet you good money that every parent who has ever gone to a concert for their kids has wished that they could just watch the part where their own child performs and ditch on the rest, but that's not what you sign up for. You go. You sit. You clap. You smile. You wiggle your tush when it goes to sleep on the hard, terrible chairs at those concerts. And, when your kid asks you what you thought, you tell them how much you loved watching them do something that they love. You tell them what your favorite song was that they sang. And you shut your mouth about the other hour and a half  (or longer) of the other kids' stuff. \n\nPlease apologize to your daughter. A good way to do this would be to say something like. \"Hey, daughter. I'm sorry I said that your concert was torture the other night. I loved watching you perform and I wouldn't have missed that for anything. I hope you know how much I love and support you, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you do next.\"\n\nThose are the things we do for the people we love.

You\u2019ve  unintentionally given her a core memory. Every time she performs, she\u2019s gonna think about this. Every time she wants to ask you come to watch her perform, she\u2019ll stop and think twice, remembering that you called her first concert torture. Until eventually - probably sooner rather than later - she\u2019ll just stop inviting you  so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about you judging her and/or being bored while she does her thing. \n\nThis is part of parenthood: your kid might be involved in an activity that doesn\u2019t interest you or that you don\u2019t know.

I hate the thing that brings you pride and pleasure. My own comfort is so much more important to me than you, to the point that I'm not even willing to pretend in order to spare your feelings.

They told you that your words were hurtful. You don't get to decide whether or not their feelings are valid. Have you considered that not everything is about you and your personal enjoyment? The point of going to the concert was to support your daughter and be proud of her.
