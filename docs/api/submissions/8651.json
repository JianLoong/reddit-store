First thing he does is reach his hand out to shake my hand, which I politely decline. \n\nI say, \"I'm sorry, offense meant to you, Sir, but I don't shake hands. it's a medical issue I have.\" Which is 100% true, when I was a kid I crushed my hand in an accident and I have some pretty chronic pain, also generally when people shake my hand they do so with way too much pressure and strength causing me injury and more pain than usual for longer. So, I just stopped doing it. Most people don't care, but he's old school and got extremely offended, and straight up said, \"This is not a good start to our relationship, and frankly, I don't believe you.\" He shook his head and walked away. This caused a lot of friction over the next month, so much so I felt I had to talk to HR. \n\nSo, I did.

He was harassing and retaliating against you. When called out by HR, he increased the harassment. It\u2019s his own fault. I\u2019m guessing after that many years, it was the final straw of straws built up over time.", "NTA - I bet you anything this guy has gotten other people fired or caused them to quit for reasons HR would have liked to know about. And I'd bet there's a few people who might be too scared to say, it but probably think you're a goddamn hero. Guys with this attitude are antiques, you aren't the one who needs to learn job etiquette, they are. And if HR acted that quick to someone with seniority, I can guarantee that wasn't their first rodeo with that guy. \n\nIf it helps, maybe you could come up with a go-to, kind of funny way to decline a handshake? Like, \"Sorry I have a medical issue, one firm handshake and I can't type right for a week!\" (I don't know how much you care to share with coworkers about your medical issues). Maybe it will help those with a more fragile worldview not be so easily offended.", "NTA.  I guess HE needs to man up and deal with the consequences.", "NTA. Retaliation for an HR complaint is one of the worse things any manager can do. And a good HR department will not tolerate it. That\u2019s what it sounds yours did. That\u2019s on him. It\u2019s also unlikely that your complaint was the first. People don\u2019t become difficult people overnight.", "Wow. NTA.

He is now paying the price.", "NTA - you are not responsible for his actions.  He is.", "Why are we still shaking hands??? Vulcan salute or bust. NTA. He was punished for his own behavior that had nothing to do with you. You may need to speak with a lawyer if everyone else is now retaliating against you.", "NTA. He got fired for *his* conduct, not yours.  Take this as a learning experience.  There will always be people like this in the workforce and many of them make it quite far up the food chain.  Best advice I have is to not make work personal.  Do the work assigned as well as you can and just ignore all the bull shit.  If you let yourself get sucked into it you'll just be miserable.  And most importantly, when you clock out for the day, leave all that kind of crap behind.  It's not worth your time to let it get to you.", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. While I can understand his \u201cold school\u201d perspective on hand shaking, it\u2019s not like you ignored it. You provided a clear explanation of the reasoning and left it at that.

Clearly this person was used to getting their way at the cost of others.", "NTA and I feel bad for you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong but the perception will be that you \u201ctattled.\u201d  Hopefully over time this will fade. Obviously someone turned him in.

People might be cautious to be extra professional around you but hey that might be nice.", "Wow, that really did go sideways, but my guess is this was not the first time this guy retaliated against someone who didn't act exactly as he thought they should. They wouldn't have fired him so close to retirement if he wasn't already on thin ice and blatantly disregarding a legit ADA issue (assuming you're in the U.S.), putting the company at legal risk. Retaliation is viewed as worse than the original offense and good companies won't tolerate it. Just keep your demeanor as even as possible, don't engage in the gossip that always follows something like this and keep focused on your job.

It\u2019s really easy when you\u2019re new in your career to blame yourself for things that aren\u2019t your fault. He created a hostile work environment, not you. If he has kids in college, he should have treated you the way he will expect their bosses to treat them: with respect. \n\nAnd I know it\u2019s hard feeling shunned but remember: someone else overheard and reported him. You have allies there who advocated for you, even if they aren\u2019t obvious yet. Just tell the grumpy busybodies that they should focus their anger on their friend who didn\u2019t have the sense to at least check his volume during an unprofessional tirade so someone else wouldn\u2019t turn him in. \n\n(PS: don\u2019t let this incident make you ever hesitate to initiate a conversation with HR again.

Which in not manly.  But this is the new millennium, and unless you are working as a roughneck or selling protein powder, this outdated view of manliness is going the way of 8 tracks and burping Tupperware.  \n\nNow, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is not the first display of toxic masculinity by this supervisor.  And the fact that his display was frightening enough to prompt a response from a concerned coworker, shows me that the gentleman really has no place in today's workforce with that attitude.  HR did the right thing, save the new blood by ridding itself of the toxic old.  Kudos to them.  \n\nAs for your other older coworkers, well, fuck 'em.  They'll die or retire or forget about this soon enough.

In an ideal world, you would have been able to show them to your boss so that he backed off, except that's illegal. You do not need to disclose medical information to your boss. Your boss chose to be aggressive during your probationary period and there is no HR department in the world that would justify his behavior. These are logical consequences so you should not feel responsible for what happened--at all.\n\nIf you're concerned about being terminated from this good-paying niche job, document everything (dates, times, witnesses, what they said). You might wind up reporting them to HR, too. And if the whole thing goes awry and they terminate you, you'll need everything for a wrongful dismissal. Always CYA. Please.\n\nThe other workers that engaged you after he was terminated, it \\*appears\\* that they have spoken to him. Your (former) boss and you were in the break room, with the one passer by (witness). Reports to HR are supposed to be confidential; if someone divulged it, you wouldn't have been accused, so I think it remained confidential. I mentioned it appears your (former) boss spoke to them for that reason: he assumed you complained again.\n\nI would say they're almost forcing your hand because if you delay things, they'll ask why you wait this time.\n\nI'm sorry that your dream job has turned into a nightmare, OP. This is a very tough situation.", "OP, you're clearly NTA. Supervisor was way out of line to treat you the way he did, all it would have taken is a conversation and a willingness to hear for him to avoid this whole mess. Instead, he set himself up for everything. He did this to himself.", "NTA\n\nHe absolutely deserved it and it wouldn\u2019t have been the first time.", "NTA\n\nYou are in no way responsible for what happened to him. HR decided his actions warranted termination not you.", "NTA it\u2019s unlikely they would have fired him for a first offense, and even if they did, it\u2019s his fault.", "NTA all of the consequences were from his actions, not yours.\n\nIf that's how he treated a new employee, and then got aggressive when given proof of your medical condition, he was likely a monster to many people there.  The older ones are probably just like him and now a little worried they could be held accountable too.  I'm guessing there are plenty of other people glad to see him gone (considering someone overheard and ran right to HR).", "NTA at ALL, that guy is a piece of work and got what he deserved. All that in the last few sentences is very unfortunate for him, which is exactly why he should know to act like a decent human being and not put his livelihood in jeopardy. I\u2019m so sorry your coworkers are retaliating against you now too. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nHe at least twice overstepped his bounds and the office guidelines and created a hostile work enviroment  ONLY because he refused to believe in your disability!!\n\nThat gets you fired in most places. Who cares about his house and kids? If he wanted to pay that, he should have been professionel in his job.", "NTA, as long as everything happened as you described it. To be offended by something so menial and right after you explained why and wanting him to know it wasn't meant as disrespect is ridiculous. I am in leadership, and it is wrong to take the 1st meeting with a new colleague and make a decision. Well, sometimes that first meeting they show you they are a shit person, but most times, you need to allow some people are awkward at 1st meetings and such. The fact that he was prejudiced and while showing his ass he was caught. \n\nYou can talk to HR and let them know how you are feeling and if they can think of a way to try and cool things out and move forward. It may be that those who are angry with you will just stay angry with you no matter what. Honestly, it must have been more history there for HR to fire him so close to his retirement if there weren't other things that had happened.", "NTA, he disrespected you publicly,  then cornered you in the break room to threaten you and got caught!

It's his.", "NTA He was totally at fault and sounds like a nasty piece of work. You were polite, gave a valid reason for not shaking hands and any decent person would have respected that.

He seems oblivious to this.\n\n He also said the result of the handshake incident was \"tension\" and didn't give any examples of outright retaliation or mistreatment by his boss until after OP made the complaint to HR. So instead of working it out with his boss or dealing with temporary tension until he made a better impression with his work OP went to HR over essentially them not liking each other. This was, in my opinion, an ill thought out escalation. \n\nHis boss was an idiot for letting OP get a rise out of him for the handshake thing and shouldn't have said what he did after OP went to HR. But it is easy to see that the boss was very offended by OP and felt disrespected. \n\nOP is going to have to deal with others in management and more senior positions who liked his boss and are now angry on his behalf and blame OP at least in part for boss's downfall. OP has ruined any chance he had for these people to want to help him or mentor him. These are the people who have power in the organization. HR is only the referee. \n\nThough OP had a right to complain to HR, he didn't take into account the big picture and has unnecessarily put himself in an adversarial position against people in the company who would otherwise be helpful to him.", "You do you, my friend."]}
