If he has thoughts to share about the baby\u2019s sleep routine he can share them at an appropriate moment when it won\u2019t wake her up.\n\nIt\u2019s also notable that you say you\u2019re the main caretaker because you work from home and he doesn\u2019t\u2026but he seems to be home often enough when you\u2019re trying to get her to sleep, which begs the question, why are you the only one doing it?", "NTA. He thinks he knows better than you, the primary caregiver, and doesn't respect your knowledge or experience. If this is isolated to this one issue, perhaps talking it through when you're not frustrated can help. If this is his default attitude, maybe he should go unless he's willing to do marriage counseling. \n\nIf you want to be petty, get a camera in her room to record the routine and show it to him.", "Nta I'm a stay at home dad and nap time or bed time we wind down and stay quiet. It's hard but it helps so much.\n\nWorking from home with no voice calls is hard too. He should recognize that baby's naptime and bed time are more important than what he has to say in that moment.\n\nHe should learn better self awareness. And also recognize that every parent has this struggle and he's a parent now.\n\nAnd incase anyone missed it I'm a man who works from home and stays at home with his son essentially 7 days a week. I have no life that doesn't revolve around my family schedule and I wouldn't change it for the world.\n\nYou only get this time with your baby/toddler once so may as well try to make the best of it so you don't live with regrets", "INFO: Has he ever successfully put your baby to sleep all by himself?  \nIf not, why is he telling you how to do it?", "NTA. You're dealing with two babies", "NTA He\u2019s already not parenting his child\ud83d\ude44. Babies need a lot of sleep so unless he\u2019s planning on putting his money where his mouth is and actually helping you put the baby to sleep then he needs to keep his voice down.

Every time he offers suggestions on how to get the baby to sleep, hand him the baby, say in a pleasant tone \u201cOh, honey, you obviously know so much more about this than I do.

At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled.   \nThe cause of anger lies in our thinking \u2013 in thoughts of blame and judgment.  \nInstead of playing the game \u201cMaking Life Wonderful\u201d, we often play the game called \u201cWho\u2019s Right\u201d.
