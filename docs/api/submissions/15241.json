In a sense, this is what it means to identify as a \u201cfan\u201d of something. So, when you refused to listen to the joke he loves, he subconsciously interprets it as a rejection of him, and takes a hit to his ego. This is why he got so upset. In a way, it is an expression of love that he cares so much about sharing something he cares about with you, even though it is illogical and the joke really shouldn\u2019t be identified with his identity/ego in any meaningful way. This is just an explanation of his behaviour, not a justification. If you don\u2019t want to hear an offensive joke then \u201cno\u201d should be enough.

Saget doesn't even get to the punchline in his famous version because he gets called onstage. The clip is taken from a documentary about that specific joke so there's a lot of context missing if you just watch Saget's version cold.

I get why for some people, shock value holds no value and dark subject matter cannot be funny. Humour is 100% subjective and not everyone can or needs to find humour in dark topics. For some of us dark humour makes the darkness easier to cope with, for others it only makes it worse. One of my favourite quotes by one of my least favourite philosophers - \"You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.\u201d", "I listened to perhaps the first minute of it, and anyone that doesn't understand that it's offensive probably needs to be locked up for the safety of others, because their judgement and understanding of what is acceptable is *severely* compromised.", "Someone who is desensitised to edgy humour, laughing at the sheer cartoonish absurdity of the joke's gleeful depravity, might not appreciate how shocking the joke could be to people with a different mindset. They're in the wrong, but I don't quite think this warrants locking them up for the safety of others."]}
