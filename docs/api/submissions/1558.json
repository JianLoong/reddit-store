Said 1,5L is at a much higher temp than any water coming from the tap and is also a lot less than what you need from the tap but works wonders usually. \n\nI bought a bunch of smaller 30x30 cm sized towels for the head sweat for my own baths - if he uses those, it might make it easier to gather and wash all the sweat towels at once, but this expects him to actually use the towels and use the boiled water. \n\nFor the record, I wouldn\u2019t want to use the sweat towel either.

Perhaps he felt hurt that he wasn't given information about this mistake he was making with the towels and had an unfortunate (and unreasonable) reaction to it. Or maybe he is stressed about the big bill and your financial situation and he is holding on the one thing he can control, which is the towel situation. Or maybe there is a third reason - I can only guess what the actual underlying emotion is to his reaction. My point is that this most likely isn't about the towels, but is an underlying issue and you need to communicate about this", "NTA lol your completely right", "NTA. I take 2 hour long baths once or twice a week to help manage my chronic pain.

From what I can get there seemed to have been a different approach to it from both of you but in the end there was no solution found. I feel like you got \u201caggressive\u201d with the sarcasm and he got defensive because he felt attacked. I used quotation marks because aggressive is a strong word and I\u2019d like to use a less intense one but I can\u2019t think of one right now.  I guess if I were in your shoes I\u2019d open the conversation that way: \n\n\u201cFirst I want you to know that this is a conversation I want to have to fix the problems we\u2019re having together, not to attack you or defend myself. I want to see what we can both do to communicate better and fix whatever problem we need accordingly. \n\nI understand that your job is very demanding and you feel the need to relax with your bath. I also enjoy spending that time with you as a bonding moment because it makes me feel like you can relax but I also get to connect with you. But I would appreciate if you didn\u2019t use my towel when you were done. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t do it consciously. The reason why I don\u2019t like you using the towel is that you often sweat when taking the bath and then the sweat dries on the towel and I don\u2019t enjoy using the towel with sweat on it. \nLast time you told me I shouldn\u2019t leave towels where you can grab them easily. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think this is a valid point. I\u2019m not looking to attack your reasoning but see it my way. I have always laid out your towel for you to take and you still took mine. You also can see from the position that this is mine and the other is yours. I would wash less towels if you could use the one I lay for you and I would also really appreciate it. \n\nYou mentioned the water bill was high. The bath you take are a large part of the bill but they are also part of your well being. We could run an experiment over the next two months to see what consumes most water. Month one you could do your best to use the towels I lay for you so I wouldn\u2019t have to wash as much and we could see how much the bill is affected. Month two, you could use whichever towel you want but reduce your bath use in terms of time and frequency. Instead an option like a tiger balm or hot water bottles could be an option.\nIf you have any alternative to offer Id happily hear it so we could solve this together.\u201d \n\nLastly I\u2019d recommend that you stay open and that you try your best not to take things personally. It\u2019s important to voice concerns in difficult moments in a non attacking way or a defensive way and to try to think \u201cif he was expressing to me what I\u2019m about to say, how would I want him to say it to me.\u201d \n\nSorry for the long text. Good luck.", "NTA I also take baths like that and I have a special hand towel I use for that exact purpose. Also yeah your water bill is high that's the cost of that.

So the baths with constant additions of hot water to keep them hot are the the water issue, not the laundry.", "Ha! That's funny you mention that!

I just make sure I keep a fresh facecloth next to me for that. I bough a big pack on Amazon that match our bathroom for pretty cheap, and that way my towel stays clean and it's a lot less laundry than full towels. Maybe something like that (or small hand towels) will help.\n\nBut I would say the 4 hour baths every day have more to do with the water bill than an extra load of laundry once a week. Also it seems pretty disrespectful for him to use your towel like that", "Is he refilling the tub throughout the 3-4 hours? Because if not, the bath itself, every night, is what is using the water.
