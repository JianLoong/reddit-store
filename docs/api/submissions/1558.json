Said 1,5L is at a much higher temp than any water coming from the tap and is also a lot less than what you need from the tap but works wonders usually. \n\nI bought a bunch of smaller 30x30 cm sized towels for the head sweat for my own baths - if he uses those, it might make it easier to gather and wash all the sweat towels at once, but this expects him to actually use the towels and use the boiled water. \n\nFor the record, I wouldn\u2019t want to use the sweat towel either.

Or maybe there is a third reason - I can only guess what the actual underlying emotion is to his reaction. My point is that this most likely isn't about the towels, but is an underlying issue and you need to communicate about this", "NTA lol your completely right", "NTA. I take 2 hour long baths once or twice a week to help manage my chronic pain. I just bring in extra hand towels and keep them by the bath to wipe my face or hands (so the book I\u2019m reading won\u2019t get damaged by sweat). I also bring in a bottle of ice water to help cool me down and keep me hydrated. It\u2019s a marathon out there, folks, not a sprint!\n\n(I do not replace the water. I manage the heat for as long as it lasts, then I finish the bath comfortably until the water cools).", "Nta I think he needs to learn how little water laundry takes and how much his showers do.", "Why is it always the ones who take multi-hour baths/showers who complain someone else is wasting water doing laundry?  I'm living with someone like that now, drives me nuts.", "NTA. \n\nGirl, I am with you: I effing hate it when my (now ex) bf used my towels. His would hang on a bar on the complete other wall from where my towels were hanging. I asked him over and over to just stop taking and using my towels but apparently he *just couldn\u2019t remember which ones were his.* \n\nI now use two giant bullseye red towels because the only way he could remember is that red means stop. \n\nYeah, your bf is upset about the constant water usage but you\u2019re just as upset about him wiping his sweaty forehead off on your clean towels. He sounds dense. Like who even uses a full size towel to wipe off their head while in the bath when he could, you know, use a small hand towel and put it near the tub before he gets in. Or use his own fricking towel which sounds like it\u2019s *right there anyways.*", "NTA. Place his towel in the place yours is in future. He can towel off with a sweaty towel.", "buy a hottub or inflatable hottub use that lol", "NTA\n\nBut crazy suggestion, can he buy an extra towel, so he was one to wipe his sweat off, and one to dry down with? And you can keep your towel seperate?", "NAH (mostly)\n\nMy husband is gross with towels and also has zero interest in thinking about which towel he grabs. I will not keep my towels in the bathroom we share. Mine go on a hanger and in my closet once they dry. We each have two bath towels and two hand towels. \n\nHe can be as gross as he wants with his towels. \n\nI send them through the wash once a week. (He'd use them until they could walk to the laundry room on his own, left to manage this himself.) Laundry for non-bed linens is one load per week; a total of 4 bath towels, 4 hand towels, and the daily wash clothes. It all fits in one load along with some kitchen linens and bathmats. \n\nBe thankful that he's otherwise clean and has found a form of relaxation that is healthful.", "Washing your towel does not add much to the water bill not even if you do it every day. Running a bath every day however...\n\nAlso, what kind of baloney is that? You need to hide your stuff because he's too self absorbed to not use it otherwise? And then he gets mad of you?\n\n\nYou are nta, but this guy...", "Regardless of all the other stuff- He should just buy a face towel!? There are small towels for your face, cheap as hell too, he should buy one. \n\nYou're not the asshole, he needs to learn better communication, and better human-ing. He's 100% the asshole here.", "NTA, aren\u2019t you doing a load of towels every week anyway whether it\u2019s 6 towels or 16? I don\u2019t see that you\u2019re using that much more water. Especially compared to a 4 hour bath?", "Tell him to find a gym with a hot tub and colour code the towels or at least get a tag with your name and put it on top of your towel.", "So you're supposed to hide your towel because he's too dumb to know you don't want to towel off with his sweat? Right. There's more here. NTA.", "NTA, the guy who needs to fill the bathtub daily doesn't get to complain about the water bill.", "NTA.", "I already voted and had a belated idea. Why don\u2019t y\u2019all invest in a jacuzzi.", "Have an adult convo about towels. No joking", "Inviting family into your home is like inviting 2 cockroaches. They'll never leave and you're stuck with them destroying their home, leaving messes and just an all around headache. Nta", "NTA. I know you said money\u2019s tight, but once you\u2019re through that rough patch, start saving for a hot tub.", "NTA. Also you're in the bath, why does he need to wipe sweat in the bath? Just wash it off", "Discussion: Could you keep your towel somewhere else so it's not in easy place for him to wipe his face on it? Then, he can keep using the same sweaty towel for face wiping.", "Give him a reason to be pissed. Wipe your butt with the towel every day before he puts it on his face. Immaturity for the win!", "NTA He knew exactly what he was doing and he didn't expect you to notice. That is asshole. Then he complains that you did notice. Even more asshole. Then he gets in a snit because you nicely call him out? Trifecta asshole.", "Your boyfriend is not only ew, he's selfish and will permanently blame you for his excesses.  Do you really want to be stuck with him blaming you for his faux pas for the next 40 years?", "NTA- 4 hour baths are what is running up the water bill... not washing towels. also, 4 hours in the bath seems a tad unhealthy...  i will sit in a hot tub for like five minutes. he might need a doctor for whatever is wrong with him.", "NTA. Pretty positive a bathtub full of water every day wastes more water than a washing machine", "Ok wait a minute does he take 3-4 hours in the bath? \n\nOr\n\nDoes he take 3-4 single hour long baths a day!!\n\nNta your washing towels ain\u2019t what\u2019s raising the water bill! It\u2019s his use of the bath every day!", "NTA. The obvious compromise is to have three towels in the bathroom, yours, his bath towel and his face towel.", "Can you colour code the towels? Like buy 2 that are green or some other colour so that he actually knows what towel is for him?\n\nBut more importantly WHY is he still sweaty if he is in the bath that long?  Does he use soap?", "NTA. So he's never clued in that taking long baths every single day raises the water bill (and is a massive waste of water)? Nor does he have the mental capacity to differentiate between two towels? Guy doesn't seem that bright, honestly.", "Wtf. Soaking in water that long isnt healthy. Daily even wtf.\nMy bf has hyperhydrosis and he doesnt take any cloth nor towel that i use to dry himself, otherwise he asks. But NTA with the issue in question. \nCommunicate, adjust, get some small towels he can use for himself. Its not that hard.", "NTA.", "\u201c\u2026he said I shouldn\u2019t keep my towel somewhere he could easily access it how was he to know.\u201d This is weaponized incompetence and ignorance. He could just get himself another towel for his sweat before going in the bath. Did he just think that both towels are his and none that is yours? He is also shifting blame for saying that YOU are the one wasting water (to clean up your sweat-contaminated towel that HE used) when he\u2019s the one taking 3-4 hour long hot baths. You\u2019re NTA but I think you and your bf should work more on communication regarding what is okay and what is not okay and set clear limits on water usage.", "NTA", "NTA. But I gotta know, what \"physically demanding job\" requires your boyfriend to spend 3-4 hours a day marinating in his own juices?", "Why do you get a different towel every time? You could've just left that one out as his designated face towel and then gotten one for yourself. A little sweat and steam isn't dirty enough to clean after one use. Ideally the first time this happened you would've said, \"hey, that's my shower towel, please use this smaller towel / cloth for wiping your face in the future.\" NTA, and not a big deal, but this has a very easy solution.\n\nHis water usage on the other hand maybe not so easy...", "Maybe you could  get \"his\" and \"hers\" monogramed towels?  Or he use one color towel and you another?", "NTA. Maybe look into purchasing a heated massage chair.", "NTA. Sounds like he doesn't want to take any responsibility, while shoving off all the blame.", "No your not the asshole", "NTA.\n\nAn extremely hot shower is just as effective, and probably uses less water than a 2 or 3 hour bath.", "NTA...What does someone do in a bathtub for 3-4 hours? Uh ..maybe I shouldn't ask that question", "ESH - I feel like there\u2019s a communication problem going on here from both sides. From what I can get there seemed to have been a different approach to it from both of you but in the end there was no solution found. I feel like you got \u201caggressive\u201d with the sarcasm and he got defensive because he felt attacked. I used quotation marks because aggressive is a strong word and I\u2019d like to use a less intense one but I can\u2019t think of one right now.  I guess if I were in your shoes I\u2019d open the conversation that way: \n\n\u201cFirst I want you to know that this is a conversation I want to have to fix the problems we\u2019re having together, not to attack you or defend myself. I want to see what we can both do to communicate better and fix whatever problem we need accordingly. \n\nI understand that your job is very demanding and you feel the need to relax with your bath. I also enjoy spending that time with you as a bonding moment because it makes me feel like you can relax but I also get to connect with you. But I would appreciate if you didn\u2019t use my towel when you were done. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t do it consciously. The reason why I don\u2019t like you using the towel is that you often sweat when taking the bath and then the sweat dries on the towel and I don\u2019t enjoy using the towel with sweat on it. \nLast time you told me I shouldn\u2019t leave towels where you can grab them easily. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think this is a valid point. I\u2019m not looking to attack your reasoning but see it my way. I have always laid out your towel for you to take and you still took mine. You also can see from the position that this is mine and the other is yours. I would wash less towels if you could use the one I lay for you and I would also really appreciate it. \n\nYou mentioned the water bill was high. The bath you take are a large part of the bill but they are also part of your well being. We could run an experiment over the next two months to see what consumes most water. Month one you could do your best to use the towels I lay for you so I wouldn\u2019t have to wash as much and we could see how much the bill is affected. Month two, you could use whichever towel you want but reduce your bath use in terms of time and frequency. Instead an option like a tiger balm or hot water bottles could be an option.\nIf you have any alternative to offer Id happily hear it so we could solve this together.\u201d \n\nLastly I\u2019d recommend that you stay open and that you try your best not to take things personally. It\u2019s important to voice concerns in difficult moments in a non attacking way or a defensive way and to try to think \u201cif he was expressing to me what I\u2019m about to say, how would I want him to say it to me.\u201d \n\nSorry for the long text. Good luck.", "NTA I also take baths like that and I have a special hand towel I use for that exact purpose. Also yeah your water bill is high that's the cost of that. Pay it or don't take so many baths.", "YTA. Your boyfriend is upset because essentially refusing to talk about the water bill because he is using a used towel. Also the length of the bath has little bearing on the water bill, unless he's draining it repeatedly.", "I did this when I was abusing Xanax. Just food\n for thought.", "I think her boyfriend might me a merman. \n\nBut indeed, I was wondering where the hell she's supposed to hang her towel, if it's not allowed to be in the bathroom.", "Seems like he just earned himself laundry duty.", "And it's not like she's running a new load of laundry per towel, either (well, I assume not). So the baths with constant additions of hot water to keep them hot are the the water issue, not the laundry.", "Ha! That's funny you mention that! I bought a hot tub for him for Christmas and a friend is going to help me build a an outdoor enclosure to put it in.  It's going to be a big surprise for him!", "Yeah, I'm sure the water is still \"scalding hot\" after 4 hours...", "Nobody likes to sit in tepid water. If you\u2019re taking 3-4 hour baths and you like scalding hot water, then you\u2019re going to be adding more hot water to the tub every 30 mins or so", "No, 3+ hour baths frequently are excessive. I have a job where I stand all day and don't get this stupid. He can use his own damn towel, it's not that hard. If he's taking several hour baths, he's using water and the hot water heater. Its obvious he's TAH.", "I mean if your certain it's just the towel issue, cool. \n\nI take baths 2-3 Tim's a week and like them very hot, so my face will get a bit sweaty too. I just make sure I keep a fresh facecloth next to me for that. I bough a big pack on Amazon that match our bathroom for pretty cheap, and that way my towel stays clean and it's a lot less laundry than full towels. Maybe something like that (or small hand towels) will help.\n\nBut I would say the 4 hour baths every day have more to do with the water bill than an extra load of laundry once a week. Also it seems pretty disrespectful for him to use your towel like that", "Is he refilling the tub throughout the 3-4 hours? Because if not, the bath itself, every night, is what is using the water. Because once the bath is drawn, the duration of time he enjoys it is irrelevant, although if he is in there 3-4 hours, then at least he is getting the best bang for his buck.", "So you think his \u201chot\u201d baths stay hot for 4 hours? Lol", "Where do you sit?", "Sounds like you need to sit down and go through your finances. He is not seeing where his money is going, that's why he is getting upset over the wrong things. You both need to sit down and track every penny. Then put a budget in place.\n\nPlus if he is working less then he shouldn't need to be in the bath as much.", "Uhhh...couples don't share towels? We have 3 towels going at a time for the 2 of us, you use what's dry (long hair and not unusual for one or both to shower more than once a day due to lifestyle)", "I completely misread it and thought it was showers.", "Yes, he should be capable of getting his own sweat towel. But for some reason she has been setting out a towel for him to use, and she\u2019s ok with doing that. Since that is part of their routine, she can just give him two towels.  No one said anything about hiding her towel. I have more than one towel holder\u2026 if just move mine to another holder.", "It may be excessive but it's not expensive. We're talking maybe a hundred gallons? That's not even a dollar. Heating it costs a little, but not on the water bill; that's going to show up on gas or electric.", "You can get covers for them too which keep them warmer for longer.\n\nYou can also get wheat bags that you heat in the microwave that do the same thing.", "Great recommendation", "Yeah, dude is an aquatic mammal at this point.", "He probably pees in there, too.", "You could even soak it in cool water and put it on your head like in Japan at the hot springs (or warm water in the winter!)", "And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s on his phone the entire time. No one sits in a bath for 3-4 hours a day doing nothing. And you\u2019re expected to hide your towels from him \u201cevery.damn.time\u201d? He is so disrespectful to you. If this is all true it\u2019s time for you to move on. And buy him some Advil.", "Probably this is the case. OP did not dare to tell him about her problem with the towels. OP seems to be a person completely submitting her own convenience and feelings to his.", "I'm guessing they get along spectacularly because they never ever see each other. \n\nI mean, presumably if he's that sore from work it must be a long day, but even if it's an average workday, he'd be gone ~9-10 hours daily, right? Then he comes home and takes a 3-4 hour bath, ~1 hour for meals, 7-8 hours to sleep... That's 21-23 hours of the day without even accounting for time to get ready in the morning. \n\nSo it doesn't sound like they interact at all, except maybe on the weekends.", "Im positive that this is true.", "I think you meant \u201cif he *is* [refilling the tub], the bath itself\u2026\u201d etc.", "No potential kids. They have all been cooked...", "We have a folding chair that I use.", "It definitely is for some people. My SO still doesn\u2019t remember after almost 8 years that my towels are grey and his are green, when HE IS THE ONE who insisted on having green towels over grey \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Depends. As a person with a super sweaty partner, definitely not.", "Oh definitely not us. Idk why but that squicks me out entirely.  \ud83e\udd23", "Or just buy an electric mattress pad. It uses very little energy, auto shuts off after 12 hours (depending on brand) and it is amazing for body pain.", "Human during the day, manatee at night", "Damn, this made me laugh at loud.\n\nIt would require a lot of water to keep it hot that long for sure.", "why do you guys have to get so weird every time", "I'm good for 2 hours with a book.", "> They have all been cooked...\n\nYeah, I'm not a doctor but I do own a set of balls and I can't imagine 3-4 hours in a hot bath is good for the old chaps", "Pair of hard boiled eggs.", "Have him buy a few washcloths to specifically wipe his face. Less laundry, done.\n\n\nThen, when that lowers the water bill not one single penny, because 3-4 hour baths, insist on an ADULT conversation on how to more realistically solve his pain problems.\n\n\nNTA.", "Just get a hot tub at this point.", "Do you always roll over when people mindlessly blame you for things? Just curious.", "Maybe he has some colorblindness and theres a hint of a slight green in your towels? If there is he might not be able to tell the difference cause in some cases, if theres a hint of a certain colour in a neutral tone that colour pops out way more", "Oh the humanatee...", "I doubt he\u2019s reading a book.
