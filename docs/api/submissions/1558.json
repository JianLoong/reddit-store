Of course the bill is so high mostly because of the baths, not your towel washing! Why is he so annoyed that you don't want a sweaty towel?!  \n\n\nCan you get a special \"face towel\" for him? He shouldn't expect you to have to hide your own towels...", "Wtf does neither of you realize how extreme wasteful this is? Keep this going for a few more years and he can have his hot extended bath in the ocean. You don't live near the ocean? Don't worry, it will be much closer by then. ESH because you encourage him.", "NTA", "Of course you're NTA but this seems like a big fight over something so small. Does he always get this upset when you call him out in a reasonable way over his inconsistent and somewhat selfish behavior? Does he always try to blame you for things that aren't your fault and then sulk and give you the silent treatment when you don't give in and agree with him? If so, you have much bigger problems than towels and bathwater.", "Nta but when he bathe you his your towel", "He takes three hour showers every day?

If you don't bring an issue up to someone, they have literally zero idea that it's bothering you so you really can't justify being upset about it when it keeps happening.

Seriously? You're supposed to hide your towel from him instead of hanging it up where it belongs? If he needs two towels, he can get himself two towels instead of using yours. Self-care is important, but it's really quite rude to leave someone else without any clean towels to use.\n\nAlso... three to four hour long baths *every day!?*", "NTA. The baths take a lot of water. Adding an extra towel to a load of laundry doesn\u2019t take up nearly as much water. Have the water bills always been this high? Or, have the rates recently gone up?", "NTA.\n\nOf course you don't want to use his sweaty towel.  And how absolutely inconsiderate of him to never question if his use of that towel was appropriate.\n\nThat said, it could be a pretty easy solve.  Stop using my towels, and I won't have to keep washing them.  The end.  He gets to have his ridiculously long baths, you get clean towels, and if the water bill is still high (it likely will be), he only has himself to blame.", "NTA. And now he knows it's your towel, so he shouldn't have a problem not wiping his face on it when he's sweaty. \n\nThat's gross. Like, how are you supposed to feel clean with a sweaty towel. Tell him to get his own face and body towels before he gets in the bath. It's basic respect.", "NTA, but put your towel somewhere else if he can't learn to not use someone else's towel.

Hint: he uses more than that for each and every bath.", "Nta break up", "How does he spend 3-4 hours of his day in the bathtub?

Has he so little self control? Why are you with someone this manipulative?", "3-4 hour long baths? He\u2019s the one wasting the water, I\u2019m sure he has to keep adding water to keep it so scalding hot. He goes to work, takes a 3-4 hour bath, then what? Goes to sleep? He needs to see a doctor or find a new job if his muscles are that sore. \n\nNTA, but how can you live like this?", "3-4 hours baths every day? Wtf?", "ESH - if you didn't like it, you should have brought it up before. If he's taking super long baths and using multiple towels every day, he shouldn't have gotten mad at you about the water bill. Just move your freaking towels and designate the one hanging above the bath the sweat towel, you don't have to wash it every single time.", "NTA, maybe you can use his tears to run his bath to reduce your water bill.", "NTA. But out of curiosity, did you ever talk to him about using your towel before this fight?", "NTA\n\nTowels belong next to the tub so that someone can grab it after getting clean.....and the towels also need to be clean. So long as you aren't doing a load per towel, the water bill isn't on you. It also doesn't make sense that he somehow doesn't realize that you have a towel too.\n\nAmusingly I am saying this as someone who occasionally takes 4 hour baths(last one was June-ish) so I know how nice it can be....When I do I drain and reheat as needed but if I start to sweat I just duck my hair in the water while trying to keep my face dry cause I read on digital devices while relaxing.\n\nAlso.....I think I'm due for a long bath \ud83d\ude1c", "Yeah he's the cause for the bill being high with the baths and using the wrong towel. Who the heck's towel did he think he was wiping his sweaty face on? lol NTA", "3-4 hour baths ?\nI worked construction from age 16 to 23 and was never sore enough to need a 3 hour bath", "3-4 hour baths every day??", "NTA- washing the towels is part of the problem (see he can be a reasonable person and use one towel but yes a 3-4 hour bath every night would take up a lot of water.", "NTA\n\nBut I would suggest hiding your towel in a bag or closet so he doesn\u2019t use it", "NTA ... Touch\u00e9!  \n\nYour tub needs at least 3x more water than your washer", "NTA. This is a bad day for men and towels", "His hours have been cut back at work, and now money is a big stressor for him.  We've been doing this bath and towel routine for 2 years, but now that money is tight, he's going through our expenses with a fine tooth comb. This is a bit of new scenario for us.", "It's worse. 3 bathes, which tend to use up more water unless you're taking really long showers.", "But she wasn't upset enough to bring it up. She just got herself a fresh towel? He seems to be the one with the issues here.", "WHO USES SOMEONE ELSES TOWEL??????", "He only uses my towel to wipe his sweaty face, then uses his towel to dry off after the bath", "Rates have definitely gone up, and he's not working as much, so it's a bit of both.  We're tightening up our expenses, but as of late, things that he never would have even looked at, he's obsessing over now.  It's definitely put a bit of strain on our relationship.  But sometimes I feel he's a bit hypocritical about what he  prioritizes.  Freak out over water usage, but buy $200 worth of Playstation credits.  Eye roll", "\u2026have you ever heard of a hot tub? A lot of people like very hot baths lmao", "He\u2019s probably standing or sitting next to the water, not in it.  So it\u2019s like a sauna.", "That's why I made the snarky comment.  I thought we would laugh about it, but he seemed genuinely upset.  He seems to be over it now, though", "Bahaha! So true, really! Usually, I'll strip down and join him the bathroom for a sauna while he stews in his juices.  We catch up on the day and spend time together there.  I actually really enjoy that because we have a no phone rule during that time.  We just enjoy each other's company and occasionally read books together.  \n\nThis was the first \"fight\" we've had about it.  It's not a relationship ending thing and he's even speaking to me again.  I probably could have handled it better.", "Lol, it's a very small snippet of our lives together.  We get along spectacularly otherwise.  \n\nMoney is definitely something that is becoming a concern, as his hours have been cut back.\n\nIn the before time, I'd just strip down and take a steam with him while he had his baths.  We'd chat, spend time together while he had his bath.  It was actually really nice.", "My partner and I have diff color towels (mine is purple his is gray) so he knows which ones are his lol (hand towels are green (: so no mix ups)", "can't you just repurpose that towel to be his sweaty face towel though?", "As it's for his muscles, he's probably sitting in the bath.\n\nDoubt he's submerged for hours in the bath, so his face would be sweating.", "Or he could have handled it better when you pointed out his role in all this.", "That\u2019s nice you found a way to enjoy it, it would frustrate me to no end! If money is tighter because his hours have been cut, he needs to cut back on the baths as well and find other ways to manage his sore muscles.", "Ours are all different browns but top hanging rack is his bottom rack is mine so not easy to claim mixed up on which is which. Same with handtowels though ours are green too lol", "I've done that too, but he happens to end up in the bath after my shower and I don't think to hide my towel, he just uses it anyway lol", "True true.  I guess maybe we were both a bit shitty in how we handled things"]}
