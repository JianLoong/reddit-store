You probably spend a lot of hours studying and have little time for recreation. Your mother needs to support herself first, before helping out others. She cannot babysit your nephew in place of securing her own wellbeing, and truthfully, she probably has enough stress in her life without dealing with Kate's want for her to help clean Kate's house. If anything, Kate needs to apologize to the two of you that she has been bad mouthing for not doing enough for her. The baby is now 7 months old meaning she has had 7 months to learn how to handle the responsibility of having children. If she truly needs help caring for her house, that is your brother's responsibility, not yours or your mother's. Kate is a SAHM. What kind of hours does your brother work?  Standard 40 hours or lots of OT? He knows she is having issues, so why isn't he helping her more or hiring help for her until she is able to take over on her own. I had 4 children under 9 years old and never had more than 6 weeks off before I had to go back to work. I never made my guests clean my house because I couldn't do it myself. Never felt like my mother or MIL needed to babysit my kids. **If** they offered great, but it was not something they were required to do.  My husband split household chores and childcare. We worked opposite shifts to keep daycare costs down, so he had no choice but to care for kids and house while I was working, the same way I had no choice but to care for kids and house while he was working. Kate may be having postpartum issues or she may wrongly feel entitled to your help, but that is still not a reason for your brother to say you need to apologize or for you to make yourself available for her to criticize.

Go and visit Kate and when you get there the first thing from your lips, \u201c Oh Kate, I need a break from all my school work!  It\u2019s getting so crazy busy that I haven\u2019t had a chance to clean my apartment.  In fact when I leave your place I hope I have enough energy to tackle that job.

So anyway, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d  Do not, I\u2019ll say again, do not give her an in to ask you for assistance.  Even if she asks you to make the both of you a cup of tea.  Just say that you\u2019re \u2018too exhausted.\u2019  And stick with the plan.

She complains that my mum never offers to babysit or help out with housework even though she lives down the street, and says that my mum works too much and should prioritise her grandbaby, and that she needs a village not an \"absent grandparent\".\n\nI both love and hate the, \"it takes a village\" mentality, because on the one hand it encourages parents not to think of themselves as an island and to **ask** for help if possible. However, on the other hand, it encourages pure unadulterated entitlement from mothers who've decided they were the first ever to pop a kid out and thus deserve more than they actually do.\n\n>I've tried to talk to Kate about these things but she doesn't really listen and accuses me of not supporting her or trying to destroy her self-esteem..\n\nSeriously she sounds exceedingly immature...that or somewhat narcissistic, because everything seems to be about her and her alone.\n\n>I've been avoiding Kate and now she's upset with me and ignores my texts, and has been making passive aggressive Instagram posts about me.\n\nSeems like both really.\n\n>My brother said I need to apologise to Kate and start visiting more often again but I don't think I'm the one who needs to apologise.\n\nYou're not. Your sister in law is treating you as equal parts maid and confidant for her messy feelings about your mother, and when you communicated that you felt uncomfortable about being made to do this she selfishly brushed it aside and made you out to be a bad guy. Then, when you distanced yourself from her, she sent your brother after you. She's definitely an asshole, doesn't matter if she's postpartum and depressed, what matters is that she's ultimately demonstrating an incapability of listening and hearing you at the very least.\n\nAlso, \"need\" is a strong word.

Anyone who has a child and then expects everyone else to change their lives to prioritize a child they did not choose to have and had no part in making us 100% an asshole and shouldn\u2019t have had kids. Having OP do housework when she visits? Absolute asshole behaviour. Shit talking OPs mother to OP? For me personally, one instance of that would have ended any close relationship. It\u2019s reprehensible.\n\nThe SIL is a MASSIVE asshole and honestly one of the worst kinds of parents.", "This, exactly. It is frustrating to see how many people have kids and expect everyone to do everything for them.", "Could be step/half siblings and Kate's the only biological child of both parents?"]}
