I got invited and even though I did not wanted to go, I put on my best dress and went. \n\nMy sister's a product of my father's affair with a coworker, I was barely some months old when my dad left my mother for that woman after he confessed to her that he got his mistress pregnant. As you can imagine, growing up with divorced parents was hard, but he made it harder. Everytime I would go to his house (only on weekends, my mom had custody the rest of the week) he would treat me very shitty like he wanted to show me how much he disliked me. His wife did the same, they never showed me love like he did with his other kids. \n\nI'm NC with my dad now and LC with my half siblings. When Erica asked me to assist her wedding I was unsure, but agreed at the end.\n\nThe wedding was fine until my father got everyone's attention to make an speech. He then went on for about ten minutes about how happy he was for Erica and such, but he kept referring to her as \"my only girl\" and stuff like that (I have two more half brothers, Erica is the only girl with his new wife). I felt very bad with that like I was ten years old again sitting on his dining table as he said that I shouldn't exist and that Erica was his princess.  I got up and left without even saying goodbye, I texted Erica to tell her I was sorry when I got home.\n\nI know I'm making it about myself when this was my sister's moment but I truly felt unappreciated.

Your father has decided that you are not his child. There's a lot of emotional baggage that you're carrying. You didn't need to sit there and continue to take the abuse from your father. And it was abuse as he is your bio-dad but has decided that you don't exist for him. \n\nI'm so sorry that you went through that. NC is best for dad and think through carefully any future engagements that could involve him.", "NTA. Erica should understand your reasons. In fact, she herself could have a word with your father if she cared enough to.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make a scene, all you did was leave. Your dad is a completely jackass. I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself and leaving the situation.", "NTA.  You handled it respectfully and were considerate of your sister.", "NTA. And honestly I\u2019m surprised you still have a relationship with your father in general.", "NTA. If she cared about you, she would understand.", "NTA and if Erica thought it was appropriate for you to have to sit through what was essentially a direct and deliberate attempt by your father to cause you as much pain as possible, she's just as big an AH as he is and should no longer be in your life.\n\nI'm so sorry you were treated this way--there is never an excuse for treating a child like this and your father has a sadistic, hateful streak 10 miles wide.  Big hugs to you.", "Definitely NTA. Erica is lucky you had the respect to not make a scene. It's good you apologized and I'd reiterate to her that why you don't talk to him. I'm sorry your dad is horrible.", "NTA.  You shouldn't have to deal with being in a situation where people essentially are insulting you to your face.  You didn't direct any anger at your sister and you apologized to her.  You were simply protecting yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou did tell Erica as soon as you decently could, without disturbing the wedding reception. She needs to pull her head in. \n\nWhat your sperm donor said was hugely disrespectful and your extended family should be calling him out on that. You are his eldest child and he should not be ashamed of your existence.", "NTA.", "Nta. Your so called father is an ass and he showed everyone that knows you", "NTA  \nSounds like you quietly left after listening to more verbal abuse from your sperm donor.  \n\nI'm so sorry he is an AH.  \n\nSounds like you should just ignore Erica as well.  Because if you ask her how she would feel if your father told the world she didn't exist, she will just get defensive.", "Being the petty AH that I am I would've put my hand up in the middle of his speech and said \"what about me 'DAD'?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You made no upsetting scene and having waited until you got home to text her allowed you to collect yourself from the event.", "NTA. It's not like you made a scene. I would have made a scene but I'm a petty asshole.", "NTA\n\nAnd Erica should not be mad at you for leaving at that moment.

I feel ya, do you boo-boo", "\"I know I'm making it about myself when this was my sister's moment...\"  But here's the thing - your father made it about HIM. He knew you were there, and it sounds like he purposely said that, either to be petty/vindictive towards you, or to get sympathy from others - so he hijacked the wedding in a very rude and hurtful way. So you are absolutely NTA.

If you're lucky, maybe he's not your bio father. Clearly not the AH.", "NTA Rant!!!\n\nI don't give a damn how good your dad was to your half-siblings. He was shitty to you and they should give a damn. Erica isn't innocent or dumb, the princess heard the shit your dad said...and didn't do anything. She planned for a speech from her daddy and listened to it. What the hell kind of warning could she need from you about you leaving. If she really cared, she would've kicked him out or hopped her ass up and left with you.\n\nOP go no contact with them. You deserve better. You're still making excuses for your half-siblings being the way that they are. That's a problem. You need to realize that your half-siblings enjoy seeing you beneath them. Otherwise, they'd stand up for you. Erica wants to believe that she was extra special being the reason for your dad mistreating you and treating her better. That is what people do when they don't want to admit that they don't deserve the privileges they get. Then they pretend that your mistreatment wasn't so bad. Yet, they know good and damn well that they wouldn't want the same mistreatment that you got.", ">Erica got mad at me for leaving without at least letting her know.\n\nWhy was she mad? Was you not staying around to get kicked like a dog in front of her entire family somehow cutting into her free entertainment budget?\n\nNTA \u2014 **AT. ALL.**\n\nWith that said, cut off all contact with all of them. Full on NC. They all sat there and let you be humiliated. They were all witness to how you were treated as a child, and while as children they might not have been able to say anything or stick up for you, as adults their behavior at the wedding was a choice.\n\nI hope you have found happiness outside of that heinous bunch and realize that your worth is not, has never, and *will* never be tied to them or their acceptance because they were never worthy of **YOU**.", "And he did it publicly at a family event! Wow, just wow.", "I can't ask her or my half brothers to argue with him about what he did to me, for them he was a good father, it's understandable they think of him as such.", "I don't have a relationship with him, I don't think he even cared when I stopped calling him and sending him texts. I have a sort of relationship with my half siblings, although it's distant, I don't blame them for anything out father has done, it would be unfair.", "The gasps heard around the world", "The objective fact is that he referred to her as his only daughter in front of BOTH his daughters.", "He wasn\u2019t a good father to them, no matter how well he treated them, because of how he treated you and how he modelled that for them.\n\nErica\u2019s proving it right now, insisting you shouldn\u2019t have left. They have no empathy for what he\u2019s put you through.", "But yes you can. That\u2019s the thing about good people versus bad people. Bad people see bad things happening and don\u2019t do anything. They will stay on the sidelines while someone is dying. Or a more realistic situation, a white man sitting on the sidelines as his colored friend is subjected to racism. \n\nGood people recognizing a bad thing happening and work towards putting an end to it.\n\nYour half-siblings are now old enough to know how shitty of human your dad is even though it doesn\u2019t impact them. Which makes them bad people.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like a good person with a truly horrible father. I\u2019m sorry you had to experience that. Take some love from an internet stranger who knows what it\u2019s like to feel unloved by your father.", "That's not Erica's fault or problem to fix. OP did the right thing in apologizing and asking her to choose sides.", "I agree with you. But as an adult, it shouldn't be too hard to see how how their dad referring to her as his only daughter would hurt her sister. I don't know how much OP has shared with her half siblings and people do tend to be self centered at their own wedding, but if Erica doesn't understand after OP explains why, then she might be an AH too. That said, if OP wants a relationship with Erica, she should have this conversation with Erica and explain the why if she hasn't already.", "Totally agree, she should tell her why she left and felt disrespected"]}
