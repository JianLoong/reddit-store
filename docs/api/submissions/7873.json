When Erica asked me to assist her wedding I was unsure, but agreed at the end.\n\nThe wedding was fine until my father got everyone's attention to make an speech. He then went on for about ten minutes about how happy he was for Erica and such, but he kept referring to her as \"my only girl\" and stuff like that (I have two more half brothers, Erica is the only girl with his new wife). I felt very bad with that like I was ten years old again sitting on his dining table as he said that I shouldn't exist and that Erica was his princess.  I got up and left without even saying goodbye, I texted Erica to tell her I was sorry when I got home.\n\nI know I'm making it about myself when this was my sister's moment but I truly felt unappreciated.

Big hugs to you.", "Definitely NTA. Erica is lucky you had the respect to not make a scene. It's good you apologized and I'd reiterate to her that why you don't talk to him. I'm sorry your dad is horrible.", "NTA.  You shouldn't have to deal with being in a situation where people essentially are insulting you to your face.  You didn't direct any anger at your sister and you apologized to her.  You were simply protecting yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou did tell Erica as soon as you decently could, without disturbing the wedding reception. She needs to pull her head in. \n\nWhat your sperm donor said was hugely disrespectful and your extended family should be calling him out on that.

Your so called father is an ass and he showed everyone that knows you", "NTA  \nSounds like you quietly left after listening to more verbal abuse from your sperm donor.  \n\nI'm so sorry he is an AH.  \n\nSounds like you should just ignore Erica as well.

He was shitty to you and they should give a damn. Erica isn't innocent or dumb, the princess heard the shit your dad said...and didn't do anything. She planned for a speech from her daddy and listened to it. What the hell kind of warning could she need from you about you leaving. If she really cared, she would've kicked him out or hopped her ass up and left with you.\n\nOP go no contact with them. You deserve better. You're still making excuses for your half-siblings being the way that they are. That's a problem. You need to realize that your half-siblings enjoy seeing you beneath them. Otherwise, they'd stand up for you. Erica wants to believe that she was extra special being the reason for your dad mistreating you and treating her better.

ALL.**\n\nWith that said, cut off all contact with all of them. Full on NC. They all sat there and let you be humiliated. They were all witness to how you were treated as a child, and while as children they might not have been able to say anything or stick up for you, as adults their behavior at the wedding was a choice.\n\nI hope you have found happiness outside of that heinous bunch and realize that your worth is not, has never, and *will* never be tied to them or their acceptance because they were never worthy of **YOU**.", "And he did it publicly at a family event!

But as an adult, it shouldn't be too hard to see how how their dad referring to her as his only daughter would hurt her sister. I don't know how much OP has shared with her half siblings and people do tend to be self centered at their own wedding, but if Erica doesn't understand after OP explains why, then she might be an AH too. That said, if OP wants a relationship with Erica, she should have this conversation with Erica and explain the why if she hasn't already.", "Totally agree, she should tell her why she left and felt disrespected", "NTA - you let Erika know via text. You didn\u2019t have to do it according to her timeline or her etiquette rules. There\u2019s also absolutely no reason for you to have stayed and listen to your father prattle ion like an A-hole.

Instead of congratulating her on getting married, they will be asking her if she is alright after you left.\n\nInstead of one of the happiest moments of her life, it is a moment that will always be tainted with drama that YOU caused.\n\nYou should have been an adult, realized that it was your sister's day, remained sitting down, content in your decision to go NC.", "NTA I am so sorry. This breaks my heart. I hate your father. He\u2019s just awful. I hope people asked who you were and are judging him harshly.", "NTA.

Just saying. It sounds like you wasted your time on that wedding.", "Nta", "What dad did is so vile that I actually suspect well-meaning but misguided sentiments like this might have been his goal.  He clearly wants OP out of his life, and probably finds her relationship with Erica very inconvenient.  He would LOVE for them to be turned against each other.\n\nUltimately though, OP is right and needs to double down - this isn't Erica's fault, and she need not get involved.  Maintaining a relationship with Erica in spite of their father's actions is totally justified, and as a bonus is the best revenge.", "Right? My God, by now, Erica and her brothers known how their parents met and still she invited them to her wedding.
