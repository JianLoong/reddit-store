I feel guilty when I don't have things to give them\" for example, would probably solve the problem.", "NTA. I'd just keep it simple and say something to Anna like \"hey, when the kids come over, can you pack them a snack bag?\"", " NTA. Sit Anna down and explain how this is upsetting you. You need to keep your own food for your family and you feel terrible withholding food from her children. Also let the children know you can\u2019t provide their snacks. Anna needs to visit with a bag of snacks for her children. All the young moms I know always carry small snacks and drinks for their kids when they go anywhere. If the kids are thirsty, provide a glass for water. Communicate with Anna and the children. That\u2019s the key to solving this problem. Good Luck.", "NTA\n\nJust ask Anna next time before the kids come over: \"Can't wait to see you! Hey, can you pack the girls a snack bag? We're trying to make the groceries stretch this week. Thanks!\" And then repeat as many times as necessary until she gets the hint she needs to bring snacks every time she brings them over if they eat like a zombie horde...", "NTA\n\nShe's your friend. Use your words.\n\nAlthough back in the day my mum was in this position.\n\nEvery Friday a family friend would come round with his 2 young children whilst his wife was at a bowling club.\n\nFor about a year my mum would feed these kids every Friday until 1 day she didn't.\n\nAfter 2 more Fridays of mum not feeding these kids the adults just ghosted my parents.\n\nOur families had been friends for years (or so we thought) but looking back the parties were always at my parents house at my parents expense.\n\nThis was pre internet/mobile phone so they just stopped returning my mum's calls.", "NAH It doesn't sound like there's actually a conflict here. You just feel bad. You said yourself Anna backs up your no or says no herself. Be an adult and make a firm line. There is absolutely no reason you should feel bad about stopping them from drinking milk set aside for customers (for example.)", "NAH, kids eat a lot. \n\nCan\u2019t you hang out at Anna\u2019s place or propose hanging out outside of your kitchen? Kids love parks and playgrounds.", "Tell her what you told us.. tell her while you don\u2019t mind giving them snacks sometimes it would be nice if she brought snacks for them or even bring snacks for all of you.. if she\u2019s really your friend she will understand.:", "Back years ago I would have my nieces come with me while I did some chores around town. They were always wanting to eat out. I would indulge them OCCASIONALLY! Finally it got to the point where they would ask all the time! I finally told them that this was a just chores around town not a stop to eat\u2026playfully I told them before we left to make sure you fed your tape worm! That took care of them eating out with me all the time! Even now they say (they are grown now) can we go with you\u2026I\u2019ve fed my tapeworm! \nSo tell your friend to feed her kids before they arrive. NTA\u2026", "NTA, I would legit ask the kids when they get there, \u201cwhat snacks did your mom bring for you today?\u201d\n\nShe\u2019ll get it.\n\nBut really just tell her how you feel, if it\u2019s going into the profits of your farm, I\u2019m sure she will understand.", " Nta", "Small healthy kids will push your boundaries when they feel safe with you.

I\u2019ve had to do this with my slightly older kids. Part of that was setting the boundary with my kids, as well as telling the neighbor kid to ask before they just open our fridge/cabinets. \n\nWe also send the kids back across the street if it gets annoying.", "NTA, she knows that kids eat and want snacks.  Explain to her you you love the company but not the costs so she needs to bring food for her kids.", "NTA but that being said, have the conversation. I think you know you\u2019re not in the wrong but the guilt and idea of \u201cnot wanting to feed a kid\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just a string cheese what\u2019s the big deal\u201d is getting to you. Sounds like Anna is a reasonable person who would totally understand.", "NTA but if you\u2019re neighbors, why aren\u2019t the kids going to their house for food? Do you look after them during the day?", "When they get hungry, send them home you need to have a sit down with your neighbor and explain your situation. Food is expensive and it\u2019s not your responsibility to consistently take care of your neighbors children. It\u2019s nice to do it once in a while but not on the daily I would really sit down and discuss it with her.", "NTA but your friend kinda is. I have never taken my kids anywhere without bringing food. If I don\u2019t bring food for them, it\u2019s a gift for the hostess (usually a food item for everyone to share).\n\n I would talk to her and let her know that you welcome them but beyond a small snack; you can\u2019t really provide daily meals.", "Ask Anna to bring snacks,although she should know without you having to ask. Sounds like Anna is getting free childcare as well as free food ( You didnt mention you are paid childminder,but the kids are at yours a lot )", "NTA Sorry but Anna is mooching of you. You feeling guilty about not feeding her kids only makes it easier for her.\n\nPut your foot down. Ask her to bring snacks or replyto the kids you don't have snacks right now, since weren't groceries shopping since the last time they raided your fridge.\n\nAlso why not suggest meeting at a playground?", "Anna must surely know that her kids are using you as a free restaurant.\n\nShe's being much too exploitative of you, however nice you say she is. Otherwise, she would stop it, one way or another.\n\nWhy not just tell her you don't want her greedy kids at your place anymore?\n\nIf she doesn't like it, too bad so sad.\n\nI think you really don't want this continuing, but for some reason you're afraid of how it sounds when you communicate your feelings.\n\nAnd that's how she exploits you. She's not as nice as you think she is.\n\nJust tell her no more kids. It's absurd for you to be feeding them when they have a mother to do that. It's their mother's job, not yours.", "NTA.

She's very chill but her husband is the type to make a thing out of it", "They treat our farm like a park lol we have 35 acres to run around on. Just this time of year, we don't leave the property much, we are haying and building pens, working in the garden. Our area is extremely rural, biggest city is about 45min away so my house is the most convenient. Their place is much smaller, I absolutely understand the allure of coming to our place over their own", "Um, no. She absolutely should not involve the kids in this or make passive aggressive comments to them that are meant for them mother. That's gross and childish. All this requires is a very reasonable conversation with the mom.

They only know \"hungry\" and \"ask a grownup for food when you're hungry\". Even if you explained it to them, the 3-year-old is too young, and the 6-year-old MIGHT understand but honestly it would probably just scare her if you told her that food was in limited supply, because she's too young to contextualise it, and then she might worry about people going hungry because there's not enough food. \n\nThis is 100% a conversation you have to have with their mother. And don't feel guilty about it at all! It isn't your job to fill her kids' stomachs, especially if it's reaching a point where they are doing things like eating half a jar of peanut butter, or drinking milk that is meant for customers.

They\u2019re not hurting for money either. It\u2019s her responsibility to make sure her kids have enough food.", "yes for sure, as far as they know milk cheese and peanut butter always live in OP's fridge - did you hear she has choco snacks?

Just say sorry no I can't offer you anything right now. If they persist just say no with no explanation. After a couple of times they will get the message. Worked with my neighbors kids.
