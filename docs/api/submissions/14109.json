Not counseling. It's understandable why he acts out so much, I don't know if Mom is not around at all or just not in the picture. But that is very difficult for children. But this level of destructive behavior and violence needs immediate attention from a specialist. Not \"so how are you feeling today\" therapy. But someone who will teach him skills on how to regulate his emotions.\n\n\nI hope that you can talk to your brother about getting his son the help he needs. And that with time you can build trust again to let him back into your home.", "NTA. History of attacking his FATHER with a fork? Continuously breaking things? You\u2019ve been patient Enough.\n\nAt the beginning I would have said yta, but reading the whole thing and getting the full picture tells me that you aren\u2019t. He has to learn his lesson sometime. Better to do it now while he\u2019s still young rather than when he gets older and is making bad decisions that affect his entire life.", "NTA but not being allowed at your house isn\u2019t really a punishment.  Dad needs to get it together and get his behavior under control. There\u2019s a underlying issue/trauma that needs to be addressed.", "NTA - not only is it your house, your rules, but you've banned a vandal from your property. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.  If everybody is banning this kid, who otherwise has no reason for behaving this way, then the problem is your nephew.\n\nHe is at a fuck around and find out stage of his life.  The earlier you can deliver meaningful but painless consequences (being banned from events/grounded/etc) the more likely he won't have to learn a painful way.", "NTA- your brother needed a wake-up call that whatever they are doing isn\u2019t enough. While as a family you should all love and support him- you can totally interact with him somewhere ***other than in your house***. \n\nI feel for your brother as it sounds like there is a bigger issue at play. And just like I sometimes wish I could hand out therapy vouchers on Reddit- I wish I could send the supper nanny to his home to sort this out.", "NTA.  I doubt the kid cares if he can come over or not, but you are allowed to invite whomever you want into your home and exclude who you don't.  As long as your nephew continues to act this way he is going to have to get used to others not wanting him around him.  I hope your brother is relaying this information to his child's therapist and actively working on correcting this behavior.  Ten year olds can start getting hormone surges and their behavior can be challenging, but that doesn't exclude consequences to actions.", "NTA\n\n10 yo is old enough to know better, to know right from wrong, what is appropriate and what is not, what is respectful and what is not.\n\nHe only has himself to blame for being banned and now that you and your sisters have others will too. \n\nIf his behavior doesn't change soon his teen years are going to be extremely lonely and possibly with a stint in juvie if he is not careful.", "NTA. Side note, I understand why you're banning the kid, but this is really your brother's fault. A 10 year old acting out this way all the time is usually die to the parent's lack of proper disciplining (nonphysical is encouraged)", "NTA - it sounds completely reasonable, if anything i think your still going too easy on the kid, since this isn't the first time this has happened.", "Nobody wants home in their home. This is his and your brothers problem.

I must say tho I\u2019ve seen with other posters on here that they put these sorts of rules in place but than get mad at the parents or whoever it may be due to them not attending events ect. I do hope you won\u2019t be at your brother for this if that is what happens in the future. I hope your nephew and brother can get help to deal with these issues.", "NTA, kid needs to learn actions have consequences during these formative years.", "NTA - but dont ban him permanently, but ensure next time he is allowed in (id assume 3-6 months, or longer, your call) that he is expected to be on his BEST behavior or it will be just as long until he comes back again.\n\nWork with your brother to ensure boundaries are set and some kind of reward system is set in place, he is family after all.", "ESH \nI don't think banning a child from family is super appropriate except in violent or otherwise dangerous situations. I think asking them to leave makes sense but not an outright ban with no time limit or boundaries. Especially if he is now not welcome at anyone's house. Kids need to understand cause and effect and that actions have proportionate effects - this doesn't seem proportionate. With some boundaries or a way to prove himself trustworthy, it might. \n\nI think a lot could have gone differently here. You know he has destructive behavior, why leave precious breakable things in his reach?\n\nBrother should have taken more responsibility for watching his child. \n\nAs a previous commenter said, your nephew needs some serious intervention. Cognitive behavioral therapy, anger management, regulating emotions, healthy outlets. Does he act this way at school too? What are his triggers? If it's just around family, maybe he has a hard time being around moms or kids with moms. Or a million other things!", "A child broke something fragile? Alert the media and call the cops. Or... don't be an asshole?\n\nYTA.", "I\u2019m torn on this one. I understand the kid being really problematic but I hate when people accuse children (10yo is a child) of being future delinquents. Or sociopaths . They\u2019re kids. They need to be educated of course, but they can\u2019t help themselves, as children. Banning them instead of trying to help is a sure way to NOT help them\nBecome better people.

YTA.", "NTA, but I\u2019m curious as to why you said you\u2019re \u201cdone trying to defending my brother\u201d? You said he understood the banning, he understood your sisters choosing to ban as well. So he\u2019s not pushing the issue.  He had (has?) his som in therapy, are there any other resources he has reached out to, to find a solution? You say he\u2019s a single dad, does he have any help beyond what his pediatrician and sons school can do? \n\nIf he\u2019s thrown in the towel and allowed his son to be a mess without consequence, then shame on him. But, if he\u2019s trying his best and he\u2019s getting now where, maybe reaching out to social services would be a good thing", "NTA, but excluding him won't solve the root of the issue.

It was an urn with his brothers ashes. That is way more sentimental and important than just something fragile. I would be beyond pissed, upset and sad. I would have done the same as OP. He is NTA.", "My brother does the best he can, he works from home, and he has 3 other children. His other children act appropriately, but the Nephew that my sisters, and I had banned had always behaved marginally worse. Now it's getting to the point that, he's becoming more destructive, so we need to do things to minimize future damages.", "I wouldn't advocate a child being removed from biological parents unless it really was a necessity. There's nothing in OP post to suggest the father is being violent or neglecting, though they could do with learning how to educate their son on appropriate behaviour.", "OP is full of shit and the whole post is nonsense, but even if it were true, OP would still be TA.\n\nThis is a human child with no mother and now no extended family because of a broken vase. The contents of the vase are immaterial because the dead brother doesn't know or care. A child is being ostracized because of a piece of pottery.", "Why? No one in the family even wants him around", "the child isn't disowned, they just arent currently allowed in someone's house. There is nothing wrong with that. Also, the vase and what was inside is NOT immaterial, it had value to the family. I honestly hope you never have kids if this is how you feel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso you have no proof that op is full of shit and that this post is nonsense", "Kids being difficult and having behavioural issues is not grounds to hate a child or attempt to get rid of them and anyone who believes you should just dump your kids into a system with incredibly heavy ties to child human trafficking for being difficult should never even be allowed near kids let alone have them", "Maybe foster care is different where you are, but it rarely solves kids problems", "Solves the problem of the kid being around", "Maybe it does, it also doesn't solve the actual problem, which is the behaviour.", "Sure it does it makes it someone else's problem."]}
