We are well off, but my son works for his own money and can buy/save whatever he wants with it. A couple months ago, he decided to buy a ps5. My daughter has a Nintendo switch, but likes the ps5. My son doesn\u2019t let her touch it because she has a history of breaking technology accidentally. I do want him to share but since he bought it with his own money I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me to tell him what to do with it. Well, the other day Robbie was playing with it, Megan asked to play and Robbie said no. A couple hours later, Megan went into the room and threw the ps5 against the wall and smashed it. It broke beyond repair. Robbie was furious. He was yelling and cursing at everyone demanding we replace it NOW and smash her Nintendo switch to make things fair. I told him to calm down, grounded Megan for 1 month, and promptly told Robbie to get in the car. We drove to GameStop and I bought him a brand new ps5 with my own money since I\u2019m the parent and it\u2019s my responsibility to replace what my child damaged. He told me it\u2019s still not fair and I should break Megan\u2019s Nintendo switch to make it fair but I told him she did get grounded and his ps5 got replaced. He threatened to break it himself, and I told him in that case he would have to pay to replace it. \n\nCome the next day, I hear Megan screaming. Turns out, Robbie went into the room with a baseball bat and beat the Nintendo switch down until it was crushed. I confronted him and told him what he did wasn\u2019t ok. Without saying a word, he reached into his wallet, gave me 3 $100 bills and walked out of the room. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do now. I think he deserves some more punishment because I don\u2019t want to send a message that destroying property for revenge is ok and those who have money can do whatever they want as long as they can pay for it. But on the other hand, my wife thinks as bad as what he did was, it\u2019s unfair to punish him. I set the consequence that if he was to break the Nintendo switch, he would pay for it himself , and he did. He decided the punishment was worth it, did the crime, and payed the price fair and square. I think she has a point, but I also feel disrespected because he just threw money at me after defying my authority as a sort of middle finger.

Megan purposely destroys Robbie's game system, because she's an entitled spoiled little brat. You decided that being grounded for a month was sufficient punishment. You were wrong. Megan's punishment should have included both being grounded (which would include having her switch confiscated for the month) and earning back the cost of the PS5 she destroyed by doing extra chores around the house.\n\nRobbie was righteously angry that his little sister gets to destroy his game system but keep hers. He was angry that you didn't punish her adequately. So he took his revenge.\n\nWas he wrong? Yes. But I understand why he did it - it's because your parenting of Megan sucks. You feel disrespected. This is good. Your actions don't deserve respect. Respect is earned, and you haven't earned any here.\n\nMegan sucks lots. You suck lots. Robbie sucks a bit.", "Return his money.  Pay for the switch yourself since that is what you did for your daughter ruining his ps5.  Then ground both of them.  With NO switch or ps5 for that month.  That may work better to get your point across.", "YTA, Megan didn\u2019t have to pay for what she damaged, but your son did", "Yikes! I\u2019d be more worried about the fact that both of your kids think it\u2019s okay to break each other\u2019s property. Sound like they both need anger management training. I think your mistake was in buying Robbie a new PS5 instead of making Megan pay for the one she broke. How does that disincentivize her to not break someone else\u2019s property? Maybe family therapy for all of you?", "Your son followed your rules of engagement. You let your daughter off easier than your son. I see why your son was upset that you didn't make your daughter pay for her destruction of his property, but his retaliation is concerning. Do you often favor your daughter over him? There seems to be something  deeper going on in your home.", "Your kids need help that you\u2019re not giving them. Your daughter throwing something she actually also values against a wall because she can\u2019t use it? Taking a baseball bat and smashing shit while smugly planning to pay for it? Please. Therapy", "JS Robbie lost more than just his PS5. He lost the hours he put into his game progress. You set the punishment standard but didn\u2019t account for that but Robbie did.

You should have taken your daughters switch AND replace the PS5. Then make her work off the debt either through chores or volunteer work. If she still had access to her switch after doing that what did being \"grounded\" actually mean?", "ESH. I\u2019m not a parent but kids breaking each other\u2019s possessions with bare hands and baseball bats is not normal.\n\nYour son called your bluff, knew the consequences and decided it was fine to him: your wife was spot on. I can sympathize with the fact that he did it in front of his sister as a middle finger to your authority, but at the same time, he is doing what you told him he needed to do. If you punish him further, you\u2019re changing the rules after the fact. \n\nHonestly it sounds like your daughter and son need help. They clearly have an issue with anger and violent behavior (smashing game systems is far beyond normal). I\u2019d stop looking at the symptom and start looking at the deep seated issues here.", "YTA.  You're fine with paying for your daughter's intentional fucking up something your son bought with his own money and then forcing him to pay for something you bought your daughter after a pathetic punishment. \n\nBe a better parent, Jesus.\n\nEdit autocorrect\n\nSecond edit:  OP conveniently left out that  apparently his daughter is in therapy for anger management, so I can only imagine the shit his son has had to put up with. \n\nDouble YTA for that shit.", "ESH. The way that you paid to replace his PS5 and made him pay to replace her Switch says it all. \nRobbie is wrong for what he did but you did not adequately punish Megan. \n\nAlso, how does she have a Switch at all? Were they sharing before? Just seems like they are treated differently tbh.", "Yeah your kids are both responding so violently, they need therapy more than punishments. This is not normal behavior for either child. I do think they should both be grounded, but there\u2019s something more going on here.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to do something about this completely unacceptable behavior. Do your kids act out like this a lot?", "NTA send Megan to boarding school. Her brother can't feel safe or happy in his own home. Instead of punishment, find a cool after school program for Robbie to join that can relax him and make him happy.", "YTA - you should have taken away her switch in the first place.  1 month of grounding was completely unfair.  Your son did something wrong but he paid the punishment YOU set out.  Adding an additional punishment now, especially considering how little you punished your daughter for doing the exact same thing, would be wrong.", "YTA. Your daughter is the problem here. SHE should be punished more than 'grounded' for a month. I bet Robbie has to bite back a LOT of abuse she doles out.", "Grounding them doesnt teach the lesson needed on this one. Ground them so they can stay at home and be around said devices all day long and potentially commit same acts again? Respect for other people's things seems to be lacking. Some form of discipline is needed for sure but I don't believe grounding them is gonna teach em shit. My dad probably would have taken consoles away/left them broken and let us go without for a little bit since they should have never been broken in the first place", "Daughter was grounded for a month correct?  He should be grounded for a month as well.\n\n\nAnd by grounded I hope you mean taking away their electronics.", "NAH. Except your daughter. \nI don\u2019t think more punishment is the right move. Like think about it, you know if you knowingly park in the wrong space, get a ticket, and pay it, no one can or should charge you more because of a \u201cfuck you, I have money\u201d attitude. BUT I do think it does warrant a serious talk about why that behavior is not ok.", "NTA for you feelings.   I think you should keep your word and not punish as he did what you said. However I would have a serious heat to hear about why he felt it was worth it. How he felt after and that what he did is not okay.", "ESH. He shouldn't have been given the option to pay to replace it. You should have grounded him like you grounded her. Or taken his ps5 back since he directly disobeyed you. Both these kids are disrespectful and entitled little shits and it's your fault for not parenting them better. Having money doesn't mean that there aren't real consequences. When he takes a baseball bat to someone's car for revenge he won't be able to just throw money at the situation. When she throws someone's computer at the wall beciase she can't use it, she won't be able to just throw money at them. Revenge and destruction need to be managed right now...they needed to be addressed years ago, frankly.", "Well, you already told him the conseqences. Those consequences didn't include grounding. You just said he would have to pay to replace it if he broke it. He came prepared to do exactly that. You have been rules-lawyered here.\n\nJust remember for future reference how he thinks. In his mind, it wasn't vengeance, it was justice. He wanted her to pay the same emotional price that she inflicted upon him.\n\nBut Now you have to face a potential escalation war between the two of them. Get ahead of the game and make certain that the price won't be worthwhile if they don't leave it here. YTA", "He disobeyed you. He should be punished for that. Give his $300 to charity and replace the Nintendo yourself because you are responsible for replacing what your child broke. Then make it clear to him that he is also your child!! Just because he\u2019s old enough to earn his own money doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s mature.

She can learn to take care of things. Then he goes to the letter of your word \u201cyou break you pay\u201d and he broke and paid it. Seems fair so far, he followed your word to a T. He was disrespected by sister and got revenge. Why should he now get punished over doing exactly what you said? Why not try investing in some family therapy so your children don\u2019t go wrecking your house and all your electronics over petty conflicts? What kind of parent are you to let it get to this point? Also: how many games and progress did either of the children have in their devices they can\u2019t get back?

You need to learn that there's a reason your son was telling you that your daughter's punishment wasn't sufficient. She destroyed his game data, not just the console - many hours of work went into that, and just buying him a new one doesn't fix or recognise the full extent of the damage she did. For a really fucking petty reason. It was vicious of her. And given that, I'm shocked that her console was left in her bedroom where it could be destroyed by your son - her grounding should have also included being grounded from gaming, with confiscation of her console for the duration.", "ESH here but also YTA because all this is just indicating that this household overall is dysfunctional, and that stems from OP being unable to parent his kids properly.", "This person said it best.     \nESH", "Also, these kids need instant therapy to figure out why they\u2019re so violent.

And we don't really know what else has or hasn't been done and to what extent there are other unexplored consequences. So perhaps Megan has just been let be and perhaps she is being lectured constantly. We don't know and either way it's not good to teach a teen that their desire to see someone punished is something they can get away with doing. Robbie needs to either not bother with revenge or to do it more subtly.\n\n Megan doesn't seem to have encountered a proper learning scenario here. It wouldn't be the first time I've seen some people pass over the violence of a woman/girl or just someone who was \"too young\". That said good chance Megan will probably get away with this kind of thing permanently if she is manipulative enough and so the treatment of her here is perhaps just getting her ready for the real world. I remember at 15 a girl stabbed me so hard with a pen it got stuck inside me and needed survival removal and didn't get so much as a detention. My own sister now at age 40 gets away with behaviour which would land me in a police wagon.

Might just be my life experience being unusually bad though. \n\n I guess my point is that the person I see most likely in a position to grow to better be adapted to \"adult life\" and to become a better and happier person with better emotional coping skills is Robbie.

And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m that rough, I\u2019m just a bit of a butterfingers.\n\nWouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not her stuff that keeps breaking\u2026.", "Klutzy people who care learn to be more careful and 13\u2019s about that timeframe, if not a touch late, when you become more aware of needing to make a conscious effort to do so.  Megan just sounds like a brat.  \n  \nLifelong klutz here. At about 12 I definitely made much more of effort to \u201cwatch where I was going\u201d and at about 13-14 could pull a \u201cdrunk guy with beer falls down the stairs, saves beer\u201d type-manoeuvre with fragile objects at around a 60% success rate (dusting was my chore for some reason, including wiping stuff down).", "Grounded from what tho? Since the switch was still in her room, meaning she was still on it. So no, she wasn\u2019t grounded. She was chillin", "Take her switch to gamestop and trade it in for a few bucks towards that ps5 replacement would be a good start. \n\nGrounded with her switch isn\u2019t a punishment.", "As I mentioned, depends on what one month of \"grounding\" meant. Like...again, it didn't seem to include \"no, you don't get to play video games\" since she still seemed to have possession of her Switch, which would be the bare minimum in my house for breaking your sibling's game system on purpose. And people negotiate/argue punishments with judges all the time, have you ever actually *been* in court? Do you think that crimes having a range of time for sentences, etc. is for no reason?\n\nedit: small addition", "She's 13 - how much is \"being grounded\" going to be different from her everyday life? It's a lot more effective a punishment for an older, more independant kid, not a tweenager.", "Oh I dont think id trust her with any of that.", "> like the parents' money still\n\nNo it's not ita called paying for services. I'd pay my 10 year old to fold washing if they could.", "Boo hoo poor little darling, like is hard.\n\nWhen I was young I wanted a game boy(giving my rough age here) $5 a week I got guess what I got for my birthday in August. That's right a game boy I remember exchanging a 50 with my dad because I was desperate for 1 lol", "For the Switch. The guy you're replying to is saying he should pay for the Switch.", "Exactly what I'm thinking. As a female it pisses me off to no end. We fight for equality and favouritism like this just breeds entitlement and an expectation to get away with anything because you're a girl.", "I didn't use the word subscription, you did. The Sony account isn't even the same thing as the *PlayStation Exclusive* subscription.", ">And people negotiate/argue punishments\n\nIn civil courts, they negotiate/argue *restitutions*, not punishments. In criminal courts the dance is a little different - but a broken Switch would not make it to a criminal court, at least not in my country.", "Ah okay, fair enough", "Yes, but for people that have a Playstation, what Chiaroscuro34 said, it was clear HE meant a subscription as that's what's required to have cloud backups of your saves.", "And you don't think restitution counts as punishment for the person who has to pay it? That's half the damn point; to make the victim whole *and* discourage the perpetrator from doing it again. Robbie was made whole, dad bought him a new PS5. But again, *nothing* was done, from what I'm reading, to discourage Megan from just breaking it again next time she doesn't get to play. Not even the bare minimum of \"if you break your brother's video games you don't get to play yours either\".", "Where are you from?", "The United States.", "I find it hard to believe it's the norm in USA (or anywhere else). If a child broke something, in the park or playground, the right thing is to pay the cost of a broken item.", "Believe whatever you want about a small Bible town I lived in 20 years ago."]}
