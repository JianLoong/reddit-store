We are well off, but my son works for his own money and can buy/save whatever he wants with it. A couple months ago, he decided to buy a ps5. My daughter has a Nintendo switch, but likes the ps5. My son doesn\u2019t let her touch it because she has a history of breaking technology accidentally. I do want him to share but since he bought it with his own money I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me to tell him what to do with it. Well, the other day Robbie was playing with it, Megan asked to play and Robbie said no. A couple hours later, Megan went into the room and threw the ps5 against the wall and smashed it. It broke beyond repair. Robbie was furious. He was yelling and cursing at everyone demanding we replace it NOW and smash her Nintendo switch to make things fair. I told him to calm down, grounded Megan for 1 month, and promptly told Robbie to get in the car. We drove to GameStop and I bought him a brand new ps5 with my own money since I\u2019m the parent and it\u2019s my responsibility to replace what my child damaged. He told me it\u2019s still not fair and I should break Megan\u2019s Nintendo switch to make it fair but I told him she did get grounded and his ps5 got replaced. He threatened to break it himself, and I told him in that case he would have to pay to replace it. \n\nCome the next day, I hear Megan screaming. Turns out, Robbie went into the room with a baseball bat and beat the Nintendo switch down until it was crushed. I confronted him and told him what he did wasn\u2019t ok. Without saying a word, he reached into his wallet, gave me 3 $100 bills and walked out of the room. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do now. I think he deserves some more punishment because I don\u2019t want to send a message that destroying property for revenge is ok and those who have money can do whatever they want as long as they can pay for it. But on the other hand, my wife thinks as bad as what he did was, it\u2019s unfair to punish him. I set the consequence that if he was to break the Nintendo switch, he would pay for it himself , and he did. He decided the punishment was worth it, did the crime, and payed the price fair and square. I think she has a point, but I also feel disrespected because he just threw money at me after defying my authority as a sort of middle finger.

Megan purposely destroys Robbie's game system, because she's an entitled spoiled little brat. You decided that being grounded for a month was sufficient punishment. You were wrong. Megan's punishment should have included both being grounded (which would include having her switch confiscated for the month) and earning back the cost of the PS5 she destroyed by doing extra chores around the house.\n\nRobbie was righteously angry that his little sister gets to destroy his game system but keep hers. He was angry that you didn't punish her adequately. So he took his revenge.\n\nWas he wrong? Yes. But I understand why he did it - it's because your parenting of Megan sucks. You feel disrespected. This is good. Your actions don't deserve respect. Respect is earned, and you haven't earned any here.\n\nMegan sucks lots. You suck lots. Robbie sucks a bit.", "Return his money.  Pay for the switch yourself since that is what you did for your daughter ruining his ps5.  Then ground both of them.  With NO switch or ps5 for that month.  That may work better to get your point across.", "YTA, Megan didn\u2019t have to pay for what she damaged, but your son did", "Yikes! I\u2019d be more worried about the fact that both of your kids think it\u2019s okay to break each other\u2019s property. Sound like they both need anger management training. I think your mistake was in buying Robbie a new PS5 instead of making Megan pay for the one she broke. How does that disincentivize her to not break someone else\u2019s property? Maybe family therapy for all of you?", "Your son followed your rules of engagement. You let your daughter off easier than your son. I see why your son was upset that you didn't make your daughter pay for her destruction of his property, but his retaliation is concerning. Do you often favor your daughter over him? There seems to be something  deeper going on in your home.", "Your kids need help that you\u2019re not giving them. Your daughter throwing something she actually also values against a wall because she can\u2019t use it? Taking a baseball bat and smashing shit while smugly planning to pay for it? Please. Therapy", "JS Robbie lost more than just his PS5. He lost the hours he put into his game progress. You set the punishment standard but didn\u2019t account for that but Robbie did.

You should have taken your daughters switch AND replace the PS5. Then make her work off the debt either through chores or volunteer work. If she still had access to her switch after doing that what did being \"grounded\" actually mean?", "ESH. I\u2019m not a parent but kids breaking each other\u2019s possessions with bare hands and baseball bats is not normal.\n\nYour son called your bluff, knew the consequences and decided it was fine to him: your wife was spot on. I can sympathize with the fact that he did it in front of his sister as a middle finger to your authority, but at the same time, he is doing what you told him he needed to do. If you punish him further, you\u2019re changing the rules after the fact. \n\nHonestly it sounds like your daughter and son need help. They clearly have an issue with anger and violent behavior (smashing game systems is far beyond normal). I\u2019d stop looking at the symptom and start looking at the deep seated issues here.", "YTA.  You're fine with paying for your daughter's intentional fucking up something your son bought with his own money and then forcing him to pay for something you bought your daughter after a pathetic punishment. \n\nBe a better parent, Jesus.\n\nEdit autocorrect\n\nSecond edit:  OP conveniently left out that  apparently his daughter is in therapy for anger management, so I can only imagine the shit his son has had to put up with. \n\nDouble YTA for that shit.", "ESH. The way that you paid to replace his PS5 and made him pay to replace her Switch says it all. \nRobbie is wrong for what he did but you did not adequately punish Megan. \n\nAlso, how does she have a Switch at all? Were they sharing before? Just seems like they are treated differently tbh.", "Yeah your kids are both responding so violently, they need therapy more than punishments. This is not normal behavior for either child. I do think they should both be grounded, but there\u2019s something more going on here.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to do something about this completely unacceptable behavior. Do your kids act out like this a lot?", "NTA send Megan to boarding school. Her brother can't feel safe or happy in his own home. Instead of punishment, find a cool after school program for Robbie to join that can relax him and make him happy.", "YTA - you should have taken away her switch in the first place.  1 month of grounding was completely unfair.  Your son did something wrong but he paid the punishment YOU set out.  Adding an additional punishment now, especially considering how little you punished your daughter for doing the exact same thing, would be wrong.", "YTA. Your daughter is the problem here. SHE should be punished more than 'grounded' for a month. I bet Robbie has to bite back a LOT of abuse she doles out.", "Grounding them doesnt teach the lesson needed on this one. Ground them so they can stay at home and be around said devices all day long and potentially commit same acts again? Respect for other people's things seems to be lacking. Some form of discipline is needed for sure but I don't believe grounding them is gonna teach em shit. My dad probably would have taken consoles away/left them broken and let us go without for a little bit since they should have never been broken in the first place", "Daughter was grounded for a month correct?  He should be grounded for a month as well.\n\n\nAnd by grounded I hope you mean taking away their electronics.", "NAH. Except your daughter. \nI don\u2019t think more punishment is the right move. Like think about it, you know if you knowingly park in the wrong space, get a ticket, and pay it, no one can or should charge you more because of a \u201cfuck you, I have money\u201d attitude. BUT I do think it does warrant a serious talk about why that behavior is not ok.", "NTA for you feelings.   I think you should keep your word and not punish as he did what you said. However I would have a serious heat to hear about why he felt it was worth it. How he felt after and that what he did is not okay.", "ESH. He shouldn't have been given the option to pay to replace it. You should have grounded him like you grounded her. Or taken his ps5 back since he directly disobeyed you. Both these kids are disrespectful and entitled little shits and it's your fault for not parenting them better. Having money doesn't mean that there aren't real consequences. When he takes a baseball bat to someone's car for revenge he won't be able to just throw money at the situation. When she throws someone's computer at the wall beciase she can't use it, she won't be able to just throw money at them. Revenge and destruction need to be managed right now...they needed to be addressed years ago, frankly.", "Well, you already told him the conseqences. Those consequences didn't include grounding. You just said he would have to pay to replace it if he broke it. He came prepared to do exactly that. You have been rules-lawyered here.\n\nJust remember for future reference how he thinks. In his mind, it wasn't vengeance, it was justice. He wanted her to pay the same emotional price that she inflicted upon him.\n\nBut Now you have to face a potential escalation war between the two of them. Get ahead of the game and make certain that the price won't be worthwhile if they don't leave it here. YTA", "He disobeyed you. He should be punished for that. Give his $300 to charity and replace the Nintendo yourself because you are responsible for replacing what your child broke. Then make it clear to him that he is also your child!! Just because he\u2019s old enough to earn his own money doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s mature.

You should have taken away her gaming stuff and made her do chores at an appropriate price til she \"paid off\" the debt to her parents for paying for a replacement PS5.", "I was going to say ESH but no YTA and your wife. Raise better children. Robbie was disrespected, had his property broken (over a tantrum mind you) and you paid for it not sis, who \u201cbreaks technology\u201d all the time. She is 13. She can learn to take care of things. Then he goes to the letter of your word \u201cyou break you pay\u201d and he broke and paid it. Seems fair so far, he followed your word to a T. He was disrespected by sister and got revenge. Why should he now get punished over doing exactly what you said? Why not try investing in some family therapy so your children don\u2019t go wrecking your house and all your electronics over petty conflicts? What kind of parent are you to let it get to this point? Also: how many games and progress did either of the children have in their devices they can\u2019t get back? I have 1k hours in Animal Crossing ( I know) and if someone went at my switch with a baseball bat the $300 wouldn\u2019t nearly cover the time and effort I put into it.", "YTA due to weird parenting.  Is he in therapy?  Is she?  They are some violent kids.  I don't see this as a comment on your authority as much as a sign of a bigger problem. \n\nWhy are your children reacting so violently to each other? \n\n I agree with others advising to return his money, replace her switch (I guess) and work on healthy reactions and relationships.  I am genuinely concerned about your kids.", "Info \n\nSo what exactly is a fair punishment for Robbie? \n\nMagan was a little shit, did something very violent without any provocation and you decided **grounding** was the only appropriate punishment. She did not have to fork over money or work for the pay it of. So 1 month is fair according to you. \n\nSo, what in your mind would be a fair punishment for Robbie? He did the crime and paid the price out of his own pocket. \n\nBy your own logic he should get like a 1 day or grounding. \n\nAnd follow up question, you don't want Robbie to think \"destroying property for revenge is ok and those who have money can do whatever they want as long as they can pay for it\"? \n\nWhat exactly kind of message is it that you think that you haven't sent to your daughter? That is ok to destroy property for **no reason** and **daddy** will pay it for her?", "NTA. Give him his money back, ground the fuck out of him, and get him to a counsellor for his anger issues. And actually, do that for your daughter too (separate counsellors). They both need to learn *now* that you don't solve interpersonal issues with violence, and that \"an eye for an eye\" is archaic justice for good reason. And your son needs to learn that you can't just pay to do bad things.", "ESH here but also YTA because all this is just indicating that this household overall is dysfunctional, and that stems from OP being unable to parent his kids properly.", "This person said it best.     \nESH", "Also, these kids need instant therapy to figure out why they\u2019re so violent. Throwing a PS5 against a wall and smashing a Switch with a baseball bat are scary levels of inter-sibling violence for teenagers, and this could easily escalate.", "Nah my dude. In the real world you don't get to punish people. Mostly people see no consequences for their actions. Robbie needs to learn this reality now. He also needs to learn that people in positions of power might be unfair and not worth ly of listening to at times. A lot of life is like this.\n\n We don't really know what a month of grounding looks like for Megan. And we don't really know what else has or hasn't been done and to what extent there are other unexplored consequences. So perhaps Megan has just been let be and perhaps she is being lectured constantly. We don't know and either way it's not good to teach a teen that their desire to see someone punished is something they can get away with doing. Robbie needs to either not bother with revenge or to do it more subtly.\n\n Megan doesn't seem to have encountered a proper learning scenario here. It wouldn't be the first time I've seen some people pass over the violence of a woman/girl or just someone who was \"too young\". That said good chance Megan will probably get away with this kind of thing permanently if she is manipulative enough and so the treatment of her here is perhaps just getting her ready for the real world. I remember at 15 a girl stabbed me so hard with a pen it got stuck inside me and needed survival removal and didn't get so much as a detention. My own sister now at age 40 gets away with behaviour which would land me in a police wagon. Although it is probably best for Megan (and definitely for everyone around her) if she finds better ways to deal with her emotions.\n\nI don't think the OP \"sucks lots\" but maybe that is just because they seem to not necessarily be worse than the parents I see in my day to day life. Might just be my life experience being unusually bad though. \n\n I guess my point is that the person I see most likely in a position to grow to better be adapted to \"adult life\" and to become a better and happier person with better emotional coping skills is Robbie. By being somewhat bad and somewhat good the OP is just getting him ready for life.", "This is the way", "She's 13. How is she supposed to pay ? With a salary from her pimp?", "Kids breaking their siblings stuff is actually very normal where I'm from. \"You break mine,, I break yours\" was the rule in my hamlet*\n\nETA:\n\nVoice to text royally screwed up.", "So he had to pay for the new switch and get grounded.  She just gets grounded apparently whilst still keeping access to her electronics", "I was going to say something about how stealing from his son isn\u2019t going to improve anything, but you know what, OP might as well fuck up as much as he likes because he\u2019s already thrown away his son\u2019s respect.", "Should have sold the switch to help cover cost of PS5. She can work off the rest and earn enough to buy new switch.\n\nSounds like kids are spoiled", "Just to clarofy - Losing access to the system for a month is not equal the destruction/replacement of the system. Destroying the console destroys your local saves. \n\nThat could mean losing hundreds of hours of progress/creativity, or even the permanent loss of procedurally generated content like a minecraft world or an animal crossing island.", "Exactly. Robbie stated, several times, that he didn't consider Megan's punishment adequate. You ignored his cues that he wanted to negotiate a harsher punishment for Megan (because that's what him stating that you should break Megan's Switch was, even if clumsily handled, opening negotiations for a more adequate punishment for Megan). He therefore decided to do it himself and accept your punishment for doing so (paying to replace it) And to the point, what did Megan being \"grounded\" even mean here OP? Since it sure didn't seem to involve \"no non-essential electronics use\" (since Megan still had her Switch in her room), which may well have been enough to assuage Robbie.", "Yup. Notice how OP pays for the one Megan breaks but makes HIM pay for the one he breaks? And that\u2019s on top of adding on to his punishment even after he completed the one OP gave to him.", "Right? Before the kid even went psycho all over her brother's PS5 you could tell.  \"She has a history of breaking electronics accidentally\" \nat 13? Most parents would call that \"being careless with electronics\"\n\"I do want him to share\" not \"it's unfortunate she can't be trusted with his things\" daughter can do no wrong in OP's eyes\n\nEdit: word", "The point is that dad should have paid for it.", "Doing her brothers chores. distribute newspapers or advertisements. You can make money at 13 if you can get your ass off.", "I mean that\u2019s an anecdotal statement at best. What\u2019s normal for your household is certainly not normal for the one I grew up in.\n\nBreaking a toy is one thing, breaking $300+ gaming consoles is something different.", "And you have to have a Sony account to even play on the PlayStation 5.", "u/puzzled-taro4026\n\n\nYou failed in so many ways here. Only a month grounding, she didn't have to pay anything, and SHE GOT TO KEEP THE SWITCH WHILE GROUNDED(fully knowing what your son wanted to do). Do better. Take classes on how to be a better parent. You are terrible at it.", "Way to conveniently leave that out of your OP.", "Just admit that Megan is your golden child who can do no wrong. YTA.", "I noticed.\nXoxo,\nAlso not the Golden Child", "But the son is now a grown up.", "A game console is a toy \ud83d\ude44 but I didn't say \"in my house.\" I said \"where I'm from.\" In other words, on the playgrounds, in the parks, even at the city pool, all the kids were generally like that. If you broke theirs, they were either allowed to take yours (if you had the same toy) or break one of your things. By parental agreement on all fronts. That's just the way it was 20 years ago.", "Yes and no. You have to have a PS+ subscription to have cloud storage. A PS account for the console doesn't have to be a subscription.", "A switch can be found easily on the secondhand market for 150, a ps5 isn't and it cost 500 new", "16 is not an adult. \n\n16 is the legal age in some red states for marriage, but it is not a legal adult.", "16 is a grown up?", "You literally just said \u201cyou break mine, I break yours\u201d was the rule in your house. What? \n\nAgain, this is anecdotal. If it was normal for you, lovely. It was certainly not normal for me or anyone I knew growing up. That is also anecdotal.", "16 and male? grown up. 20 and female? still a child. That's how this subreddit seems some days.", "Well that's embarrassing. I said \"hamlet,\" not house \ud83e\udd26 I guess my voice to text didn't grasp the word, and I rarely check what I voice. Editing to say what I meant."]}
