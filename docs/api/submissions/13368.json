She got upset and said she just wants to feel safe, to which I reminded her nobody over there needs pepper spray to feel safe.

Someone commented a dupe or something.", "NTA for refusing to go and feeling uncomfortable about the pepper spray. Now if you seriously reported your sister to the police for carrying pepper spray, that would be messed up. Especially if there are reasons for why she feels it\u2019s vital for her safety. \n\nI definitely agree with you that when you are in a different country/city, you abide by those laws and rules. I just wouldn\u2019t go. She has a very entitled mindset that the rules don\u2019t apply to her because she has special circumstances. It seems she solved the problem for you though. It\u2019s a shame that you have to miss the trip, but if you\u2019re nervous the whole time about getting in trouble would it even be worth it?", "NTA you dont want to be locked up abroad.", "NTA, I mean,... I wouldn't go with her if she's doing something illegal.  There must be other ways to feel safe.", "NTA. Always follow the local laws.", "NTA.  \n\nIf your sister carried a gun instead of pepper spray would she also want to try and smuggle that in?? \n\nWhat your sister wants to do is illegal and could result in major issues not just for her (if she is caught with it).  \n\nIf she is caught at the airport then she WILL be arrested and deported (plus an exclusion order) - there is zero tolerance in the UK for illegal weapons.  Your fate if travelling with her would depend on what you both admitted to you knowing.  Best case scenario you would need to make a decision as to continue with your trip or return with her\n\nA scenario what happens if she actually does feel for what ever reason the need to use it (which may/may not be valid)- she can be arrested and charged with violence using an offensive weapon even if she did feel it was in self defence.  AND if you were all present you could all be done for aiding and abetting \n\nThe law is crazy sometimes where people have actually been charged for defending their homes/children when someone has broken in because the offender has gotten injured.\n\nMy honest advice is that If your sister doesn't feel safe visiting London without the need of an illegal weapon then she shouldn\u2019t visit and you should maybe visit your friends on your own.   \n\nThere is as someone has already pointed out a defence spray that is legal in the UK (Farbgel) which your friends could order ready for her arrival.\n\nPS. Your friends should also know better and not be encouraging her to break the law and smuggle in illegal weapons. \n\nPersonally I think you should still go to London but on seperate flights to your sister.", "NTA. If you travel together and she is caught with an illegal item you will *both* be punished. They can and will deport you. You will have wasted all that money anyway. \n\nPepper spray is pressurised. TSA in the US will be looking for pressurised canisters in both checked and carry on luggage. People have trouble getting deodorant through, she's going to get the both of you in trouble, and her *willful non-compliance* will count against you. If you know or suspect she has a prohibited item and you don't speak up you may also be in trouble.", "NTA but I think threatening to call the cops was a bit to much; honestly I'd have gone on the trip just to see her get stopped by TSA trying to smuggle it past security.  The fact is, lots of people carry things they shouldn't all over the world to feel safe, the problem is they are breaking the law; but don't be a dick and call the police on your sister for something like this, that is just low.  I respect your \"when in Rome\" and agree with it, just not your tattletail nature.", "ESH. She's planning on breaking the law, and her plan is extremely dumb anyway. She sucks for that. \n\nYou, however, are no better. Threatening her with the police or blackmailing her with not going to the trip is not the way to go. Not if you actually care about your sister. \n\nTelling her \"nobody over there needs pepper spray to feel safe\" is entirely ridiculous. People in the UK cannot carry pepper spray as civilians, it doesn't mean they wouldn't if they could. It doesn't mean there aren't cases where pepper spray would come in handy and help a woman defend herself. It doesn't mean violent crimes against women don't happen over there. \n\nIf you actually cared about your sister you should've focused on helping her feel safe without her material crutch. Maybe suggest other defense mechanisms she could use that are legal in the UK.", "There's a workaround that a police officer once told me about. (Pepper spray is illegal here in NYC, too.)

Most likely it will be caught when her checked bag is scanned before going on the plane, and will simply vanish.  \n\nYou don't have to be involved in any way.  Enjoy your vacation.  Let her deal with any consequences.", "YTA.", "YTA for saying you would call the cops on her. From your vague details, it sounds like she has a good reason for feeling unsafe. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right for her to carry it illegally, but you basically invalidated her trauma and suggested she get over it. Maybe instead you could help research legal alternatives so you could both enjoy the trip and she doesn\u2019t have to feel vulnerable the entire time.", "YTA\n\n\"Call the police when we land\" oh get off your high horse dude.\n\nShe wants to feel safe while traveling and wants a non-lethal way to do that-pepper spray. UK laws are stupid, and if she violates them and gets caught thats on her.\n\nBut saying you won't go with her as a result, or, will call the cops on her, is an AH move.\n\nAlso, lots of brits would carry stuff like pepper spray (and many carry knives, albeit illegally) despite it being illegal because their safety is more relevant than some stupid laws that don't do anything to protect anyone.\n\nBecause criminals in the UK carry knives, pepper-spray, acid, anyways because they're criminals.", "NTA because it is illegal there. \n\nBUT are there legal self defense items that you can purchase once you land? Such as non-toxic spray, a personal alarm, a pocket knife (if allowed), etc? This may be a good compromise so she can feel safe and you can feel like the laws are being obeyed. Additionally have a safety plan in place that includes not walking late at night, making sure you know your route, taking taxis as much as possible and things like that.", "NTA, it's illegal here for a reason.", "NTA, but pepper spray doesn't work on everyone. I worked in a prison for 15 years, I have been sprayed by it directly and indirectly dozens of times, i have used it, been around it being used, and can say it does not work on everyone. If someone is in an altered mental state, has had their nose broken before, likes really spicey food, has been around it a lot it may not work. If she really wants to feel safer, while self defense classes will not make her \"Black Widow\" it will give her confidence and that is something most predators try to avoid. They want targets who give off the weak scared vibe, and avoid confident ones. It is about the predator/prey dynamic.", "NTA", "ESH - She risks being deported if she is caught.

It\u2019s illegal, if you\u2019re carrying you ARE legally a criminal, you will be arrested.\n\nIf you want to carry a weapon in Canada that\u2019s up to you, but as someone who lives in the UK, I don\u2019t know anyone who carries a weapon on them.", "If your \u2018Brit friends\u2019 carry weapons, they\u2019re up to shady shit or they\u2019re lying to you.", "I live in uk and you and your 'friends' all talk shit. If they even exist.", "Ah yes, we gotta get all those pointy pencils.\n\n*Oi mate, you got a liocense for that there pencil bruv?*", "Ok my dude.
