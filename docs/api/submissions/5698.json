{"id": 5698, "submission_id": "zvrlg6", "title": "AITA For Loving My BIL's Gift And Not Wanting To Get Rid Of It Like My Husband And BIL's Wife Want Me To?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (32f) have a BIL \"Todd\" (43m) through my husband \"James\" (36m) and I would say I have a close but still respectful relationship with him and his wife \"Rachel\" (45f). We've all known each other for at least seven years and were at each other's weddings plush we've given one another gifts in the past. So I really didn't think of anything when it came to us giving each other gifts again this year.\n\nHowever back in 2020 Rachel did a lot of soul searching and has become (I think it's called) \"minimalist\" where she stopped caring so much about material possessions and prefers to only have the bare necessities. She's sold a lot of her past stuff and put half the money towards saving while the other half goes to charities that she feels deserves them, which I think is good for her, but I didn't like how she was trying to push/shame everyone around into that life.\n\nIt actually got so bad between Todd and Rachel that they now have separate finances completely because they kept fighting over how to spend the money and what on. Example: Rachel cancelled a lot of streaming services without Todd knowing and then tried to convince/shame him into going along with it after the fact because it's a \"mindless luxury\" and that money could be better used to X organization. However the remaining issue is that Todd makes a lot more than Rachel so when they split finances Rachel's financial contributions to whatever organization she felt deserved it diminished and she still brings it up on occasion.\n\nJames doesn't want to get involved in Todd and Rachel's financial issues so he pretty much shuts Todd down when he tries to vent but I'm more than willing to at least listen to his frustrations. My husband is aware of all of this and has never said anything about being uncomfortable with my talks with Todd so I thought we were all cool. For X-mas we went to my In-Laws place to exchange gifts, as usual James and I just gave Rachel a receipt for X charities that we donated to in her honor and James a gift card. James decided to gift me a beautiful designer hand bang and I lost it with the amount of enthusiasm I had for it.\n\nThis is something that I never would've been able to afford on my own and I certainly never expected anyone to buy it for me. I was extremely grateful and Todd just said that it was his way of thanking me for being an awesome SIL all year. Rachel and James were both silent over the matter but when we got home James went off about how upset he was that Todd for giving me the bag and for me accepting. Rachel also sent me a long text message about how inappropriate it is for me to accept such a large gift from anyone other than my husband or father and that it can off an immoral impression.\n\nThey both want me to give Todd the gift the back but I don't want to because A) Todd gave it to me B) It's literally the nicest gift I've gotten this year C) I'm pretty sure if we were in a different tax bracket this wouldn't be as big of a deal so AITA?  \n\n\nEdit to add: Because a few people keep asking so I'll be adding this  \n\n\n1. Yes, my BIL makes more than my husband.\n2. Another reason why I don't want to give the bag back is because this is the type of thing I wish I could get and know that there's no other way I'd one for at least 20-30 years because I have kids, a mortgage, a car note, and student loans. \n3. The only thing way that I would be uncomfortable if the roles were switched was if another woman had gifted my husband underwear or something. A PS5, sport tickets, or an expensive watch? I wouldn't care. \n4. I'm the type of person other people like to go to and talk about their issues so it was really nothing to me to listen to BIL.\n5. No, I do not bash Rachel when BIL talks to me about her and I do stick up for her from time to time which is why her comments about Todd's gift leaving an \"immoral impression\" was so hurtful to me. \n6. I never initial calls/talks to BIL about Rachel. \n7. BIL and Rachel having been going to couples' therapy but I'm not sure about individual therapy.

Why would you give it back? Your husband doesn't own you, and I find it curious that he thinks he has a right to opine in this way.

Both Rachel and James are complaining over their perceived social restrictions regarding how close you and Todd should be.

Maybe he gives expensive gifts to everyone but his wife.\n\n**But, if he gave you this luxury item because he is having problems with his wife and is using you as a gift giving proxy, then it\u2019s not appropriate to keep it.**\n\nYou should think about whether you really want to get between your BIL and his wife.

I mean, I don't think you should have to actually *return* the gift back to your brother-in-law, but at the same time, I can see how him giving you such an expensive handbag kind of raises some eyebrows.

I do agree that this seems inappropriate and a bit out of line.\n\nStill, I'm going with NAH.", "As much as I want you to keep the bag, I suggest you don't.

You clearly don't like you SIL. When you are 'more than willing to let him vent', you clearly take his side in their conflict. Your husband doesn't want to be involved, but you are very involved in their relationships. \n\nNow your BIL gives you a gift that clearly says - here is a very expensive gift for letting me talk s\\*t about my wife to you and taking my side. And you are surprised his wife is not happy? You escalate conflict between them.", "YTA if you keep it. You spent some time listening to your BIL complaining about his wife, and he rewarded you with an inappropriately expensive gift. Sounds like he outdid whatever your husband gave you. Probably not on accident. He was either using it as an FU to his wife or your husband or both, plus ingratiating himself with you. \n\nYou need way better boundaries.\n\nAlso, of course it would make a difference if you all were in a different tax bracket. If the gift amounted to pocket change it would be no big deal.
