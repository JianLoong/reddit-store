The in-laws are wanting to come stay for a few WEEKS when the baby is born (they did this by surprise with baby number one). I can't stand my MIL because she doesn't listen to anything anyone says. She doesn't abide by any rules or boundaries I set including not posting my sons picture on social media. \n\nA bit on our living situation; my husband and I live in a 2 bed, 1 bath, 700sqft apartment. The bathroom is only accessible through our bedroom. At the current time we have 2 adults, a toddler, and two large breed dogs in the apartment at all times and a 3rd adult (my mom) that comes on weekends to help out around the house because things are getting more and more difficult as I get further in my pregnancy.\n\nNow, the issue is, my MIL thinks that she is entitled to come stay for 4 weeks once baby number 2 is born, as in we tell her when I go into labor, In-laws drive down (with their loud yappy dog), and they stay in our apartment for 4 weeks so they can meet the baby. They did this with baby number 1 as well but decided to surprise us by just showing up at our apartment 2 days after I got home from the hospital. \n\nI was miserable the entire time they were here because MIL has no respect for personal boundaries. I would ask for them to step out of the apartment so I could breastfeed, MIL refused (I was unable to establish a milk supply and had to resort to formula because of this), I asked her to at the very least knock when she had to come to the bathroom, MIL refused, I asked for them to please take their dog out so it would stop making messes in the floor, MIL refused (then refused to clean up said mess, saying its not her house to clean). My husband refused to stand up to her and I was still going through recovery from birth so I really didn't have the energy to fight with her on anything. \n\nWhen my husband said they wanted to do this again, I asked him to tell them they would have to get a hotel room. This resulted in me being called selfish and rude by MIL, and told that I just need to suck it up because its their grandchild and they deserve to see him when hes born. \n\nShe refuses to get a hotel room, refuses to respect any boundaries I set, and refuses to wait until the baby is a few weeks or months old because then they won't \"know her\". \n\nAlso keep in mind that they would be sleeping on our couch the entire time, which was a major complaint of hers the first time around since she has back problems, and her suggestion to fix this last time was that my husband and I buy her an entire matress and bed frame so she could be comfortable.\n\nMy husband, MIL and FIL have been making me feel like I'm the one in the wrong here because the in-laws live in MN while we live in GA, and they hardly get to see each other.", "created_utc": 1673396306, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108pxyx/aita_for_wanting_my_mil_to_get_a_hotel_room/", "score": 597, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He MUST tell his mother to back off and stick to it when she does not. \n\nIt would be ultimatum time for me; No visitors AT ALL until you feel up to it or you and the baby will go to your mother\u2019s and stay there until you are ready.  If husband cares more about his mommy\u2019s opinion and feelings then he can be with her for the weeks she\u2019s visiting while you recover quietly elsewhere with your child.

Absolutely ridiculous to be imposed upon this way and at this time! It's not your job to host, nor to clean up their dog's messes. \n\nIf you EVER let them in your apartment again, get a wedge to lock the bedroom door.

No. NTA. If I this happens, and I were you, I would myself pack up my two kids and get a motel room and not tell them where I\u2019m at. This is disgusting behavior on their part and your husbands.

She her mum starts sending over unprescribed antidepressants and stops sending across her birth control as she only wanted medication from home.

You're going to have to give him an ultimatum if he won't do what is obviously the right thing to do and support you.", "YTA for having \u201ctwo large breed dogs\u201d in that apartment.", "You have a husband problem. Tell him no and if he insists then take the baby and go stay with your mom.", "She refuses to get a hotel room, refuses to respect any boundaries I set, and refuses to wait until the baby is a few weeks or months old because then they won't \"know her\".\n\n**AND YOU REFUSE TO HAVE HER IN YOUR HOME PERIOD. NTA**", "Hardcode no. Put a stop to this immediately. They are NOT welcome to stay with you. If your husband chooses to prioritize them over his own family, it\u2019s time for you to take the kids and get a different place.", "NTA. Have your mom pick you up from the hospital and go stay with her with your toddler. Problem solved!", "NTA\n\nIt's not the best suggestion but if they come take your kids to a homeless shelter with you. And file for divorce", "NTA NTA NTA. I'm so sorry, OP, this sounds like a waking nightmare. \n\nI like the suggestion to have your mother come stay with you so that your in-laws can't--that might be the most feasible solution in the short term. Plus your mom sounds like she's actually helpful. \n\nBut in the long-term, maybe rethink your marriage? I just don't see how you come back from something like this, where your life partner doesn't have your back and enables other people to cause you such misery.\n\nThe petty part of me says if all else fails and they stay with you, make their visit as miserable as you can. Probably easier said than done when healing physically and emotionally, but my wouldn't it be something if, for example, the dog poop they don't pick up (what the FUCK???) kept finding its way into their suitcases?? Like, \"Oh sorry, you never pick it up so I thought you might want to keep it :)\"\n\nAnyway, I wish you the absolute best of luck and hope you find a path forward that works for you. Preferably without your husband, unless he somehow fundamentally changes who he is as a person.", "Have your baby and go to your moms house! They can stay at the apartment with your husband. I\u2019m sorry you have a spineless husband but stand up for yourself. Tell your husband he won\u2019t be at the birth of his child if he doesn\u2019t stand up for you (ya know since you get to control that)! Good luck mama NTA", "I will steal a comment from many other people:\n\nYou do not have a MIL problem, you have a HUSBAND problem.\n\nNTA for setting reasonable boundaries. PIL and husband SUCK.\n\nGet away if possible and try getting your husband into counseling with you if you want to stay with that spineless guy\n\nedit: NTA", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be dealing with this all. Tell you husband to get his ass in gear and deal with his parents. They are not coming in your apartment, end of conversation.", "NTA. But i dont feel sorry for you, because if you cant stand up for yourself and enforce the boundaries, no one can. And you still want to have a 2nd child with your spineless husband after you have neen through it. Well, good luck to you.", "NTA, maybe you and the baby should go get a hotel room or go stay at your mom\u2019s then your husband can host his family. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Win win situation in my opinion. Either that or you tell your husband to go stay at the hotel with them if he isn\u2019t going to be helpful after you carried and gave birth to your child. I\u2019d throw the whole husband away but that\u2019s me.", "NTA but the husband and in-laws sure are! Go stay with your mother. Your husband needs to grow a spine. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. \ud83d\ude1e", "Your home will not be comfortable or safe for you and your new baby with this going on. \n\nPlease go stay with your mom.

If he insists on this arrangement, then he can clean up all the messes and entertain them himself.  Meanwhile, you can go stay with your mom until they leave and your house is back to the state it was before they showed up.", "NTA. Your husband needs to grow a spine. Love. honor and cherish that's you not his mother. If she comes pack up and stay at your moms or a friend's house. Check your lease for pets call in your own complaints noise and smell.  Might be the needed wakeup call for your husband.", "Tell your husband to grow a back bone. Surprised he was able to get you pregnant since his ball bag is still at his parents house.", "No.\nNTA.\nPut your foot down.\nThey aren't entitled to any of this.\nA new mom should rest too. They should understand and not make stuff even more complicated and stressy.", "NTA at all!!! My maternal grandmother lived in another country and didn\u2019t feel the need to move in when I first arrived and she knew me very well without being under my parents feet when I was a newborn.", "NTA - girl go stay with your mom after the baby is born or right now. This is a nightmare situation. You need to recover after having a whole ass baby.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou don't have (only) a MIL issue. You have an husband issue.  \n\n\nTry going to couple therapy.  \n\n\nAlso , since when you can't have a relationship with a kid if you don't meet him at birth?  \nI meet all my step family at 14, when my parent divorce and my father got a GF. I had better relationship with them than with some of my \"blood\" family", "Never let them in again.", "Honey, you're describing an abusive marriage. This is all abuse.

Use that word..mommy. because he is acting like a child still attached to the nipple and not YOUR partner who he helped make a baby with.", "I have to second this, unfortunately.", "Go ahead and call a divorce attorney too", "I seriously do not think this is an over reaction.  This situation is 100% ABUSIVE.", "Go now! Don't wait until the second baby is born. \n\nAnd inform your hospital that you don't want your husband's family in the room (and maybe not him either.)\n\nNTA", ">100% this. If your mom is within driving range, have her pick you and baby up from the hospital and head straight there and stay for 6 weeks or however long it takes for you to get your strength back. Maybe in-laws want to entertain older kids and take care of the dogs while you bond with the new baby.
