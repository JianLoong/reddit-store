Maybe in a few years they *could* become friends, but that age difference says hell no right now.\n\nEven if they were actual siblings, *which they aren't*, I wouldn't expect girls at 12/13 to be thrilled about hanging out with a 9-year-old.\n\nIf your girlfriend keeps pushing this and you give in, you will be poisoning your relationship with your daughters *possibly for life*.\n\nYour daughters lost their mother. If they don't openly hate Cara and your girlfriend you're doing well, but your girlfriend may well make that happen anyway.\n\nYou aren't treating Cara unfairly unless *you* treat her like you don't care about her.

If you let your daughters do their own thing, maybe they'll warm up to Cara somewhat, maybe they won't. But if you force them to hang out with Cara, that will 100% build resentment.\n\nThere's a balance to be struck here, and while again forcing your daughters to hang out with Kara all the time isn't the right way to go, it's not unreasonable to have some \"family time\" like family dinners where all of them will interact.\n\nThe dynamic of younger sibling wanting to play with older sibling/s who don't want to deal with them is also very common, and happens all the time even with full bio-siblings.", "NTA time for Amber and her daughter to move out.

Your girlfriend should understand that.", "NTA", "NTA. Tomorrow you need to bring her a bunch of boxes and tell her to start packing. She is not going to give up and eventually your daughters are going to turn on you when Amber starts confronting them when you aren't around. And whatever you do do not let Amber ask your daughters to babysit Cara, if the two of you want a night out hire a sitter, it's not your girls' job.", "NTA. Tell her to move out. She\u2019s disrespectful to speak to you like that and to come in and make all these demands of the girls.

You have a right to choose who you want in your life which you used that right by choosing your gf and her daughter to have your life.

It\u2019s not mean that they don\u2019t want Cara in their room, it\u2019s their boundary. They don\u2019t want Cara in their safe place. Stop calling it mean. They don\u2019t have to befriend her but they have to be respectful. Cara has to be respectful too though and she needs to respect their decision when they don\u2019t want her in their room. Your gf also has to respect your daughters\u2019 boundaries so she needs to stop forcing her kid onto your kids. AND STOP CALLING YOUR KIDS MEAN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT. SOUNDS LIKE THE ONLY MEAN PERSON IN THIS STORY IS YOUR GF.", "From the sound of it, this relationship is good for you and Amber, but not so great for the girls. And it's going to suck for you and Amber too if she continues to try to force you to force your older children to hand out with her younger child beyond what you're already doing to prevent meanness.\n\nYou are sensible to resist Amber's demands that you force a closer relationship between the children.  It will only push them further apart.  And they might never feel like sisters no matter what Amber wants.\n\nPlease reevaluate whether this is going to work out.  Perhaps it would be wiser not to live in the same house for a while.  Perhaps a long while...\n\nNTA", "Nta you can't force your children to spend some time with anyone else. Again, she is just your girlfriend and you need to have your kids best interest at heart.", "NTA\n\nYour priority is your children's wellbeing. They've lost their mother. A new woman has moved into their home with a child they don't really know, and now that woman is trying to force them to treat her like a sister. It's a lot for teenage girls to handle.\n\nCan it be handled well? Yeah, if everyone is given grace. You're right that they can lead the way on how to build future relationships as long as they're not being cruel. Talk to them about kindness and inclusivity, how to be polite when wanting their own space, etc. Check what level of bonding activities they're comfortable with, and do those.\n\nThe problem is with your new GF. Her reaction isn't OK. She has no right to force anything, and is trying to punish you into doing what she wants. And what she wants isn't good for anyone, including her own daughter. If she calms down and realises she was wrong, this is salvageable.\n\nIf she doesn't, you need to end the relationship and ask her to move out. This will happen again, repeatedly, if you don't, and it will make everyone in the house miserable as well as destroying your daughters faith in you. Put your kids first, always.", "NTA\n\nYour daughters are teenagers. No teenager wants to hang out with a little kid. Family or not.", "You cant force kids/teens to get along. Its not possible. Period. \n\nNTA. You stand by your daughters. If they dont bullie or mistreat the girl, you dont need to interfere. Maybe talk to them only to understand what they think of the girl and step mom, but dont force it. \n\nYour new girlfriend seem very pushy about this, so put some boundaries about her and the girls. If she keep insisting about this I would consider this moving in all together thing.", "NTA but my partner and I have a daughter each. They had a fairly large age gap. They get along great but we never make them spend time together. My daughter who is older often chooses to on her own accord but the key is to just naturally let that dynamic play out. Obviously we go out together and they spend time together then but at home we just leave it be and they will but also sometimes they don\u2019t and that\u2019s fine.", "NTA. But you have a bigger problem than whether your daughters should be forced to hang out with your new step-daughter.   \n\n\nThe age difference may be part of it. That Dina and Tracy always stuck together is obviously a part of it. There may be other reasons, from simple personality differences to discomfort at the change that Cara and your girlfriend moving in caused. Cara also moved out of her usual environment and may miss her friends.   \n\n\nSo you need to do two things, first is to talk to your girlfriend and discuss the whole incident and talk about how each of you parent your child(ren). For your relationship to work, you need to be on the same page, or at least understand one another. Second, you need to talk to your girls to understand their feelings. While doing so mention that if things proceed, Cara could be living under the same roof for at least 4-5 years, so they might want to get along with her. See if they can spend time with Cara occasionally, maybe once a week, to play, or do something fun together. At the same time you and her mom could try to find Cara new friends or activities to keep her busy and less reliant on the teen or near teens in the house.", "nta. forcing the girls to hang out will only cause resentment. they need time to adjust and forcing it won't help. maybe try family activities rather than forcing them to spend time together.", "Does ur wife not understand how girls work ? Lmao", "NTA, but it's a real problem. Social isolation is a form of bullying. It's not like your girlfriend's daughter has another couple of sisters two doors down the hall she can try with if this relationship doesn't work out. It sucks to have to play alone in your room and hear your sisters laughing next door. All these people telling you to break up with your overbearing gf aren't going to have to worry about it. Any mom worth her salt isn't going to stand for their daughter being socially excluded in their own home, she'll leave on her own accord.", "If you believe your daughter's behaved meanly then what actions are you taking to correct the behaviour. As a parent of teen girls I know that even the best kids can sometimes be mean, not once have I ignored it when it occurred. \n\nI agree that making them spend time with Cara may not be the answer. However, it sounds like you aren't doing anything about what you consider mean behaviour, and as a parent I find that irresponsible. When our kids a mean or amoral or spiteful or rude we do something. What are you doing?", "**YTA**   I will never understand why parents decide to blend families without some extensive work with the *children*.   A few weekend jaunts are not nearly enough t set the stage for this.  Children are not just baggage to be moved where you want them.  Ideally, you would have had a few family counseling sessions with your girls discuss what might change and how they wanted to treat Cara and be treated.   Same goes for Cara and her mom. \n\nNow you've set them up for conflict with no out.   Your girls are old enough to appreciate that they can maintain their boundaries without being unnecessarily mean.   They have always had each other, Cara is younger and hasn't had anyone.   Talk to them.", "Yta. Theres an age difference but you can still have outings for the girls to bond with their new sister. She's going to feel unwanted and excluded which will only get worse now that you guys live together.
