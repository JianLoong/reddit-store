I have an appreciation for my partner's parents even if I don't agree with everything they say or believe in. My partner and I currently live together and share a 1 bedroom apartment.\n\nFor the past year, I've been running into a particular problem when my partner and I spend time with his mom. She can be chatty and loves telling stories about herself which isn't a bad quality; however, she likes to do this for what I would consider a long period of time. About 8-9 hours. When we used to host her at our place, she would generally come over for dinner at 6pm and then would stay until 2-3am. I find this to be a lengthy period of time, and I generally tap out after 3-4 hours. The other uncomfortable aspect is that the conversation is generally about her, and she is the one talking the majority of the time about her life, emotions, past stories, and relationships. She's actually commented to us that she likes spending time with us because we're such a good audience.\n\nAnyways, I've started to feel uncomfortable with these long dinners because I get tired and bored. I asked my partner to spend time with her at her place or outside so that I could have the apartment to myself and enjoy my alone time. He was very receptive and would go out to restaurants to meet with her. I suggested that perhaps every other week, I could join them for a 3 hour dinner/activity/hang out which he was agreeable to. What I'm trying to do is create a hang out situation where I feel comfortable spending time while not asking them to change up how they want to spend time together. If they want to hang out for 8 hours then I really respect that. I just ask to not be a part of it.\n\nMy partner's mom is starting to give vibes that she's not a fan of not being able to come over to our place. She's started being a little rude to me and was acting like she owns the place the last time she came over. While I understand that she might not not feel great about not being unconditionally welcomed in our home, I don't want to compromise on my own peace and comfort.\n\nAITA for not inviting her over more and not putting up with her long stories? I'm wondering if I should just put up with it so she feels welcomed, but I simultaneously want to honor my own feelings and experiences and not be a doormat in this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: On one of these occasions when she was over, I said at 1am that it was good seeing her but I was going to bed. She wished me good night and then continued to carry on with her conversation to my partner until 3am. I honestly don't believe a person could be that oblivious to social cues.....I think she is doing it on purpose which is why I have started to become irritated with her. To me, that is very entitled behavior. I also cannot sleep in the next room because their conversation is clearly audible. She's giving me a lot of attitude now and directs her entire conversation and eye contact at my partner when we spend time together. It comes across like she wants to be the princess and wants us to cater to her whims and emotional needs.", "created_utc": 1682621989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1312dtq/aita_for_not_putting_up_with_my_partners_moms/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some excuse like you have to get up early the next morning and it being such a small apartment with thin walls that their sitting up talking past say 9 or 10 would keep you from sleeping etc.?

Can you talk to them about a good way you can all have a conversation with his mom to set a boundary? Note, you\u2019ll likely get pushback which might be why your partner puts up with this behavior. Setting boundaries with parents can be HARD. Good luck!!", "NTA. It's your home, she has no right to get mad that she isn't invited over. Maybe if she didn't overstay her welcome every single time, things would be different. Moreover, talking nonstop about yourself for literal hours is incredibly rude and selfish. Pretty sure you don't want to be hosting her TEDTalk in your living room, so. If your partner is good with this new system, then keep the status quo. She can be cranky about all she wants, but you set the boundary and you should keep it. If her rudeness towards you bothers you, tell your partner to talk to her about it.

Withholding judgement till I know that. \n\n Sounds like you need to talk to your partner. He has as much right to use the space as you do, and if this hybrid model of some restaurants, some parks, her house, your house, etc. works for that then sure. But you can't really ask your partner to stop hanging out with his mom if he likes it. \n\nYou've said you go to bed, that's kinda the limit of what you can reasonably do. Without having info on how often these happen, it's hard to provide proper advice on how to proceed.

Christmas holidays every other year is good enough.", "What does her son say about all of this? Or is he use to it and sees it as no big deal? If it's supposed to be your home together then you get a say. Limiting visits to 3 hours and guests not staying until 2/3am is definitely not unreasonable.

While there is a bedroom for me to go into, I want to be able to stretch out in my living room and do things in the kitchen too. Basically, I want her to not be there anymore after a certain point.

But she doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s clueless. Her being short with you and only making eye contact with her son is a big clue. Set boundaries and stick to them with the apartment. Your partner is willing so keep it going.", "But he IS willing to set the boundary of only getting together with her away from your apartment, so I think you should stick to that. It doesn't matter if she doesn't like it. Let them go to restaurants (or over to her place?) and then you join sometimes for 3 hours. That sounds like a totally reasonable compromise. \n\nIf she asks about coming to your apartment, you can explain that you can only handle 3 hour visits in your home. If she agrees to only stay that long, then you can try having her over again, but if she overstays, then return having visits at restaurants or her place only. \n\nIt sounds like your partner will back you up on that.", "Yes it's definitely his call but you can make your opinion heard. I'd be concerned about where else in his life his mother would expect to dominate.\n\nI don't get why he needs to be losing so much sleep while listening to her talk. He's copping out here, his mum might be a little miffed if he says he's going to bed at 11 p.m. but honestly isn't he thinking of her well-being with her driving home at 3 am?", "But he needs to set boundaries", "No, it is her partner who needs to do this. His mom, his obligation to set her straight. A simple conversation before she comes over. We love having you mom, but we\u2019re not retired, and we have work, etcetera that we have to get up and do the next day. We need to start cutting our visits at 9pm.", "Wow, she sounds just like my mother-in-law. Who knew there could be 2?   \n\nWe try using the word \"we\", but it doesn't always work. \"Well, it looks like it is past our bed time. It's been so much fun, but we have an early morning tomorrow.\" When it is 'we', there isn't anyone left to talk to, plus united front and all. Having your partner in obvious agreement with you makes all the difference.\n\nSometimes we make plans to get together for lunch and let her know beforehand we have something to do later on the evening. If we invite her over for a movie and it becomes apparent she isn't going to stop talking, I'll just tell her, oh, if we want to watch the movie, we better get started or there won't be enough time before bed. Then if she talks too long, we don't watch it. It only took not getting to watch the movie once to let her know we meant it. All of this is without heat or irritation, just like we assume everyone knows this is how visits go.\n\n\nWhen all this works, turning your visits into something better, then you can be generous and have a long visit every once in a while.\n\nI've never figured out how to get her to talk about anything other than herself and what makes her mad, though. My husband did tell her privately that listening to politics makes me stressed and to avoid it.\n\nGood luck, and of course, NTA.", "Is there a \u201cDad\u201d in this picture or only the mom?", "I have a 1 minute rule.

I\u2019ve had conversations with people that lasted way longer than I expected because I found the person delightful but if that happens more than one to two times that\u2019s a problem. 8 hours every single time is nuts. I just read an article from OSU about people who exhibit narcissistic personality traits and the biggest thing they mentioned is that they solely talk about themselves and aren\u2019t particularly interested in other people. Might be something to look into if you haven\u2019t already. Also our home is our sanctuary. We\u2019ve extended an \u201cyou\u2019re welcome anytime\u201d to exactly two people and neither of them are family. I cannot imagine dealing with someone who thought it was ok to do this.

He says he's not willing to deal with it in a forceful way because previous attempts to set boundaries resulted in issues and guilt tripping so he's cool with my ask for them to hang out somewhere else.

My FIL is like that. If we allow him, he will go on for hours. And I know for sure he doesn't have malicious intent.

Then he would too.\nEdit to say NTA.", "So he's allowing her to get her way bc she might whine. Does he plan on allowing this for the rest of your relationship with anything she wants? When is enough enough?", "Maybe go to her house so you can leave when you want", "ESH, I can see your point but I think you should compromise with allowing her over to your place at least once in a while.

So sorry, I\u2019m an introvert & this sounds like hell.  Can your SO go over to her place?", "We think she exhibits narcissistic personality traits and don't know how to follow the conversation with her sometimes. My partner is ok with me going on my phone and not being fully engaged in the conversations. I think he likes having me physically there for camaraderie though. \n\nWe were seeing her once a month, but when she wanted to start spending time every week that's when I talked to him about not having her over.", "thank you so much kind person", "Ur not \"forcing\" him to do anything. As adults we all need to set boundaries with our parents. He needs to set a boundary that all company, not just her, leave at a reasonable hour. This way it doesnt seem like shes being singled out personally. Softens the blow a bit. That time should b something u and ur partner discuss and agree to. Then u both stick to it and make everyone around u stick to it. At my house, it's phone calls after 9pm. Unless it's an absolute emergency, no one calls here later than that. It gives everyone time to visit and still go to bed at a decent hour. Company goes the same way, everyone out by 9pm on work nights.", "Yes I'm going to speak to him firmly about this. I prefer to avoid conflict and addressing things head on, but I really want to stand up for myself here and be communicative with him.", "I think I can but it's also the emotional irritation that's keeping me up. I don't want to accommodate so much, because I will grow to feel resentful of her.", "Yes spot on about the whining. I've learned from this to not be a person who whines or emotionally exerts pressure with my partner to get my way. Witnessing this has shocked me into realizing that was not good behavior on my part when I've done that in the past with him and others.\n\nHe put his foot down when she wanted to temporarily live with us for a month or so. On one hand, I would prefer for him to enforce boundaries here as well, but I'm also choosing to trust in his progress on setting boundaries.", ">She wished me good night and then continued to carry on with her conversation to my partner until 3am. I honestly don't believe a person could be that oblivious to social cues\n\nYour SO is included in that because they could have also stood up to go to bed while ushering mom out the door.\n\nSo you do have an inlaw problem (figuratively) but either SO doesn't mind and is on a completely different page than you or they're terrible at standing up for you as a couple.", "You need to get your partner on this. At 11, he should say something to the effect that, \"Look, Mom, this has been fun, but we have an early morning tomorrow. You good to drive, or should I call a cab?\"  I mean - the space is yours as well as his, and he can't just have his mom turning into an Occupying Force.", "You\u2019re certainly NTA because 8 hours of nothing but \u201cThis is my life\u201d is about 6 hours too many in one dose. Narcissistic maybe but I have to wonder if she isn\u2019t just lonely. \n\nHow long ago was the divorce? Does she have a job or was her role in the marriage a sahw and mother and now she has nothing to occupy her days? You make no mention of siblings so your partner is possibly an only child with a mother that likes to hear herself talk, about herself apparently. I have to wonder if she has any friends or any social life other than your partner. If she has anything to fill her time with.\n\nThis one is up to son to deal with.", ">because I will grow to feel resentful of her.\n\nI think that ship has sailed. Get the noise machine.
