He should be able to trust you, end. Ofc idk the rest of your relationship though.", "Nice update, could also call her meals for short", "You having to track down one of his exes to get him to believe you is a MASSIVE red flag", "THIS! If you think this person is crazy\u2026 my mom filled out my birth certificate while my dad was busy getting her food.

I don\u2019t know how it works where you are but it might be something to look into", "Great compromise.\n\nI do however hope that next time your husband will take your word instead of you having to track down an ex to back you up...", "Totally agree!! He believes the ex but not his own wife?? Yikes \ud83d\ude33", "Yeah. OP, after you recover from the birth, maybe think abour divorce.", "I know right? id be livid and he wouldn't be my husband any longer", "Yup, same thing happened with me. My parents chose a name \"together\" and then when, in her words, my mum was \"high on gas and air\" my dad filled in the birth cert and chose a completely different name.", "Coulda been more because two people with the same claim made it harder to dismiss (just to play devil's advocate) but after that he gave the reason as 'the name is too old'...", "Hahaha thank you!
