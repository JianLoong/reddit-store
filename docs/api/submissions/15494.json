Put the blame where it belongs: Ashleigh's shitty parents who couldn't be bothered to help her make a smooth transition into your family. You did the right thing by following thru on your promise to take your daughter to Disneyland. Don't ruin it by feeling guilty about circumstances that were beyond your control. Thank you for your kind heart and actions in taking Ashleigh in. Wishing you all the best.", "What you're doing for Ashleigh is great, and it's not like you didn't do everything you could to take her with you. In the best case scenario you could've all went together, but it didn't work out and that's not on you. Make sure that Ashleigh understands that you would have loved to take her too and bring her a little souvenir from Disney. 100% NTA.", "NTA. It sounds like you have jumped through so many hoops to get her to go. If you can afford it, maybe take her on a solo weekend trip somewhere this year so she can have all of the attention and have a good time.", "NTA.\n\nYou did everything you could but things didn't work out for Ashleigh. It sucks but you have nothing to feel guilty about.\n\nThe alternative - cancelling the trip - would have been worse. Your daughter would have been heartbroken.\n\nYou arranged suitable care for Ashleigh so you're gold. Enjoy Disney and I'm sure she'll get a chance to holiday with you in the future.", "NTA. Fun fact - this is actually the plot of Home Alone 5.", "NTA. You are doing your best to be there for everyone and not lose out on what seems like a very expensive trip. I feel for Ashleigh but I think as long as you treat her like family going forward, this isn\u2019t going to be something that like traumatizes her or makes her forever feel less than. I saw a comment that you are gonna plan a little trip with just her and I think that is perfect and will go a long way to insuring she feels accepted.\n\n\nAlso I\u2019d suggest trying to make sure you go to Disney again when affordable, as you don\u2019t want her to look back and think that she\u2019s never gone to Disney but remembers when her family went without her.", "NTA\n\nYou're already such a blessing to Ashleigh. She is lucky to have someone love and care for her the way you do whereas her own parents...well, let's not go there.\n\nTruth is you tried and it didn't work out this time around. As you have said, you will make up for it. This is your time to relax and enjoy the outing.", "I understand why you feel like a jerk but I think NTA. It sounds like a really shitty awful spot to get stuck in and you had to make a decision that honestly could have gone either way. \n\nThat said, I think you missed an opportunity to make your new daughter feel like she belongs as part of the family.", "NTA. It would have broke your daughter's heart if you had cancelled. I'm sure Ashleigh is well aware of all that is going on and understands why she can't go. It's awsome you taking her in and I'm sure there will be plenty of other family trips that will more than make up for it.", "You did your best and it didn\u2019t work out, 100% NTA.", "NTA. You literally moved heaven and earth to make it happen, but it just didn't work out. You're walking a slippery slope here. You're trying to bring in a girl and make her feel welcome and loved, but you need your bio daughter to know that she is loved and not going to be pushed aside. \n\nI think if you had canceled the vacation, it might have led to resentment towards Ashleigh from your bio daughter.  I think all things considered you made the best of a bad situation, and you shouldn't feel guilty. You're doing a wonderful thing for Ashleigh.", "NTA. You tried your best. But her AH parents didn\u2019t cooperate with you. Your child should your top priority.", "NTA you did your best trying. Not sure why you\u2019re feeling guilty, when it\u2019s clear you had attempted to include her", "I was leaning towards you could always go another time, but reading your recount, there was always that glimmer of hope that she could make it which made you not want to cancel the trip. \n\nShe is 19. If you sit her down, she would understand. She probably would appreciate you trying. I guess yall just have to plan another vacation with her.\n\nBut i have to say taking care of another person's child is really kind of you. So go easy on yourself.", "YTA. I understand what you're doing for Ashleigh is great, but parental responsibility means making sacrifices. That's not your daughters friend anymore. That's your daughter. You dont get to pick and choose when she's part of the family. How is she ever going to feel like part of the family when you've prioritised your holiday over her just after she's legally been tied to you?\n\nEdit: I know that OP is probably a great parent to her daughter and that buying stuff for Ashleigh is nice, but showing her pictures and videos is going to feel like salt in the wound. When you take parental responsibility, that's committing to looking after the whole child, not just the bits that aren't traumatised.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou do not take a kid in and then let her know the harsh truth that you do not actually care about her THAT directly.", "Yta. \nAshleigh will never forget this. Ever. \nShe's going to have, or already has, a lot of trauma...she's not with her parents for a reason.  That hurts children deeply. She will carry those scars forever.  And now you've chosen to leave her behind.  I bet you anything she feels hurt, less than, unwanted...all of the above.  She is a child. \nThis will have huge ramifications that may not appear immediately. Trauma is not always so straight forward. \n\n\nWould it have taken a month or two to get the passport?  Why not just postpone?\n\nI will never understand leaving a child behind that is yours.  She is yours now.  Do better. This is a huge red flag to me.  You're either a family or you are not.", "Ashleigh is now part of your family; you shouldn\u2019t have gone without her. YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel so bad leaving her and I miss her so much! I hate that her parents played such a big role in ruining this for her!", "I\u2019ve bought her so much and filmed videos of characters saying hello to her! I will bring her to Disney, the passport application is already sent off again.

I do still feel guilty though.", "They made that many?", "We\u2019re definitely going to do Disney again all of us. \nI already booked our couple of days away, it\u2019s not the same, but we\u2019re going to Legoland, she\u2019s very excited. \n\nI just can\u2019t shake the guilt, my family said she seems happy & fine, but I can\u2019t help but worry!", "I feel so guilty for leaving her.

You\u2019re right! Such a hard situation!", "You have nothing to feel bad for. None of this is your fault. She's so lucky to have you", "Videos from a vacation that emphasize the fact that I was excluded from it would have make me feel like shit as a kid. You may want to rethink that.\nAnd next time, if one of your kids can\u2019t go, you change the plan to do something that includes them. That poor girl is dealing with a life-altering transition and you just made it clear that she\u2019s an afterthought who will only be part of the family when it\u2019s convenient for you.", "I don\u2019t think you need to feel guilty, but I also don\u2019t think the feeling is gonna go away while your still at Disney. Make sure your daughter has an amazing time and try to stay in the moment, but you care about Ashleigh, it\u2019s inevitable you are gonna feel guilty she can\u2019t enjoy this with you even though it is absolutely not your fault.\n\n\n\nAlso kudos to you for everything. It is very hard to take parental responsibility from someone, particularly someone you aren\u2019t related to, so I can imagine she truly needed you and I commend you for fighting for her.", "Something I'm learning is that it isn't all about the holidays. It's about showing up every single day. I have step daughters and this is something I work on a lot. The memories and fun times of holidays are great. But the times my girls truly make me feel special is when they notice that I'm there for them when they need me.\n\nSo I would say to not be too hard on yourself over this and to just learn from how this experience has made you feel.", "Ashleigh feels 10x worse than you do about it, I promise.", "Opps. Then perhaps, i would take the safer route and pick a place where she could join us without her passport. I wouldnt risk this tiny girl not joining us. \n\nWe can always go next year when i have her passport for sure.", "I see your point, but I think that if she's taken *parental* responsibility for the child, for as long as that's the case, she's the *parent* in the situation. It's still incredibly hurtful to be left out of a holiday they let her get excited about. OP has also since promised that she can come with them next year, meaning that they intend for this to be a long-term thing.", "But that's literally adopting a child, only to blatantly favour your bio child. They could've cancelled and gone somewhere they all could have enjoyed. At 9 years old, they gave Ashleigh hope (she was begging her birth parents) and then just went, \"see ya!\" when it didn't work out. She's gone from parents who let her go live elsewhere as a literal child, to parents who let her stay home from a family holiday at the age of 9! This poor kid is always going to feel unwanted.", "What a bullshit, just hot air. She is not even important enough for you to delay a holiday.", "Enjoy your vacation with Jade with an absolutely clear conscience -- it sounds like you are and will continue to be an excellent parent to both girls. \n\nAnd I know at least somewhat whereof I speak: when I was little my parents needed some time to get their act together & family members took care of me. I don't know what I would have done or where I would be without them. And am grateful every day for what must have been a considerable sacrifice on their part. \n\nMind you, it took me becoming an adult and a parent to truly appreciate this - I was a bratty kid and a nightmare teen. So don't expect any thanks soon. But in time? Your good karma account is already overflowing. And I predict that the good you are doing now will in time vastly improve also your life. \n\nBut - for now - patience. \n\nGood luck with your newly blended family. I predict it will end well.", "She asked for videos, and I promised her I\u2019d get them, we\u2019ve video called with characters and such too. Doesn\u2019t anywhere near make up for it, but it\u2019s what she asked for. My daughter is on a school trip next month so I\u2019ve booked two nights away just me and her and I\u2019ve booked a summer holiday for all of us. I hated leaving her, but I felt so bad talking to my daughter about cancelling, not to mention losing the money from the holiday. \n\nAsh is not an afterthought to me. I love her, but this has been hard on everyone, I never expected to gain another child and my daughter went from an only child over night. It\u2019s been hard to navigate.", "I disagree with your wanky opinion", "This!\n\nIt\u2019s all about presence not presents.", ">We can always go next year when i have her passport for sure\n\nAre you involved in this story?", "I\u2019d agree with you that she\u2019s the parent in the situation if per local laws she didn\u2019t have to ask the kid\u2019s actual parents, who obviously didn\u2019t want to cooperate, in order to take the kid. I\u2019m not disagreeing with the sentiment of your comment here really, just that it seems unfair that OP doesn\u2019t have legal powers of a parent when it comes to the child, but still is being held to the moral standards of a parent when things fall through due to the bio parents being AHs", "You're doing your best. You got stuck between a rock and a hard place and made a tough decision. Main thing is to reinforce to her that given any choice she'd be coming with you and the fact you already have planned that small trip specially for her when you get back so she feels appreciated shows that.", "Please don\u2019t listen to that person and feel guilty. You did all in your power to get her on that trip and have nothing to feel bad about. Your daughter deserves time too. Often the bio child gets lost in the shuffle as all the time and attention goes to the new sibling who needs more. Canceling would have sent the wrong message to her that your promises no longer mean much and she\u2019s not a priority. \nAnd if you\u2019ve been doing pare ring right- which it sounds like you have\u2014 Ashleigh gets that you wanted her there badly. She knows she\u2019s not an afterthought. She\u2019s been dealing with shitty parents a long time and can tell the difference. Kids aren\u2019t dumb. Sometimes life gets in the way of our best laid plans. Just keep going and there will be other trips.", "Read it in entirety. \"I would\" at the beginning of my response suggests that I wrote what I would do if I were in OP's position. \n\nI should charge you for teaching you how to read. But i think youre already paying a price by having to be a pain in life.", "It was a simple question based on the wording, not an attack or accusation. Nothing that merits you finding my posts in other places and insulting me.", "You are making it appear as if i was overestimating you.  That question is loaded. Clearly, i wasnt involved in the story. \n\nInsulting?? Aint that taking it too far. I was curious about your tendency to correct people which you do have! And i pointed them out using emoticons.
