{"id": 9102, "submission_id": "10th5su", "title": "AITA For Forgiving My Brother But Not My Ex-Wife", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (40m) have an identical twin brother \"Steve\" and used to be married to my high school sweetheart \"Amanda\" (40f). I proposed to her after high school but when we told our parents they felt that we were too young and convinced us to at least wait until college as the stress of grades could effect the relationship.\n\nDuring sophomore year I decided to drop out and enlist in the military since I was unwilling to sign up for any debt. Amanda didn't like the idea of seeing me even less but I assured her that it would only be temporary, we'd still get married after she finished college, and listed all the benefits of me joining the military. She was starting to warm up to the idea, until her nosey drama loving cousin told her about all the cheating stories and told me that if I didn't get out of enlistment we were over. She told me this the day before I was scheduled to report for training and fly off for basic training. I had to go.\n\nThe break up only lasted a few weeks and I officially proposed to Amanda after training was done. We got married and started living our lives hoping from base to base over the years and had kids. However after our second child was born Amanda started longing for home and we moved back.\n\nWe bought a house back in our home state but I had to be stationed somewhere else for a few months in order to go live there. It was hard but Amanda and I made it work. During this time I made friends with a female co-worker but nothing ever happened. I told Amanda I was arriving later than what I actually was so I could both surprise her and be well rested. I stayed with a buddy of mine on base and I actually spent part of the day helping a superior officer put together a bedroom set for her daughter.\n\nWhen I arrived home I walked in on my wife and another man. Thank goodness my buddy was there with me otherwise I might've gone to jail. I was furious but Amanda didn't show any remorse and then proceeded to tell me that she knew I had cheated and would be reporting me for it. I was so confused.\n\nApparently, Steve pretended to be me so he could get laid and that's who Amanda's nosey cousin saw and after it was revealed that I had lied about my actual return date, Amanda wanted revenge. Steve immediately confessed and apologized and after my superior officer and friend gave their statements I was cleared of everything. I filed for divorced, kept contact with Amanda down to a bare minimum, and didn't speak to Steve for years.\n\nEventually Steve and I made up and we're good now but Amanda thought that I had finally forgiven her too and was upset when I stated that I didn't. Her cousin is calling me sexist and that I'm being a bad dad for treating the mother of my children so coldly. AITA?\n\nEdit: Since people are asking and/or have questions let me try to clarify\n\nWhen my brother was out at a club a girl \"recognized\" Steve from a social media post and started chatting with him. She assumed Steve was and just didn't correct her. That was how he pretended to be me. They hooked up by the end of the night and that was that. As identical twins Steve and I had a habit of either pretending to be each other or letting people assume we were the other person because it was fun. Once Steve found out what happened he immediately confessed and was very apologetic. I eventually forgave him because, in spite of everything, I still loved and missed my brother. I don't love or miss Amanda. I can't explain it but after seeing her with another man in our house something in me clicked and love started to die.\n\nEdit 2: Because we have kids, I'm forced to still communicate with Amanda. For their sake I'm civil but cold. I don't say anything beyond \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye,\" I don't ask how she's doing, I have her blocked everywhere on social media, and unless it has something to do with the kids I don't acknowledge and/or respond to anything she has to say.\n\nEdit 3: Yes, I DNA tested my kids, they're mine. Amanda even had the audacity to be upset over it.\n\nAlso no Steve and Amanda never slept together and Steve said he only pretended to be me to get laid once.  \n\n\nI also mentioned the female co-worker because Amanda always felt threatened by our closeness and tried to get her in trouble with the military too. My colleague shortly retired after the incident and came out as gay. To the best of my knowledge Amanda never apologized to her.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1675519523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10th5su/aita_for_forgiving_my_brother_but_not_my_exwife/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Should he have thought of that (especially since they had played Parent Trap before)? Absolutely. But I agree it wasn\u2019t malicious. The wife, on the other hand?  What a piece of work . . . .", "Did you miss the part where I wrote that I didn't speak to Steve for YEARS?", "But as far as we know, the ex didn't see anything and knows the brother, she knows they are identical twins! It's nothing like OP, who literally walked in on her cheating", "What do you mean? What he's doing makes complete sense. \n\nHe's not insulting, not overly rude. He is civil. \n\nBut he is also cold; not willing make small talk, talks only about the children, and is not warm or inviting in conversation. Not willing to play buddy buddy. \n\nThis actually seems like a good way to handle things when co-parenting and one side has betrayed the other like this. Otherwise the wife may think it's okay to engage him in other conversations, which he is unwilling to do. By reacting this way he has set a boundary.", "Comment is not showing as edited, maybe you misread?", "Informed consent is for medical procedures dingus", "I hear you, and I feel like any deception is bad, but arguably not being the specific human being they think you are is different to not being a CEO or having a 6-figure salary.", "You forgave him and not your ex, pretty self explanatory that you think what he did is okay in the sense that it is forgivable to completely fuck up a whole family in order to get laid.\n\nYour ex also fucked up her family by getting laid but it is not forgivable in your eyes.\n\nThere are nuances, but they are both fucked up. I would forgive both or neither. The only thing that would change my verdict is if your ex didn't think what she did was wrong.\n\nEDIT: This isn't even touching on the fact that your brother essentially raped this woman through imposter sex. That woman consented to sex with you, not your brother. Something else for you to think about when letting your brother off the hook.", "Because now you have forgiven him and not the woman who thought she was reacting,  albiet irrationally, to alleged cheating????\n\n\nETA: NTA but I can't make sense of your logic", "No, I didn't. Just they seem equally responsible for how shit went down. \n\nYour brother was destroying your reputation.\nYour wife with (probable picture evidence of your twin) tried to destroy your reputation before shit got cleared up. \n\nShe should have just divorced you instead of screwing another dude. And your brother shouldn't have been pretending to be you and screwing other chicks. Both of them suck.\n\nAlso if you don't want judgement against your brother, wtf are you posting on aita?", "Okay, yes the wife knows the twin exists. But then when the twin call themselves as the OP's name and is seen hooking up with a chick, then wtf do you expect them to do?\n\nLet's say my husband Jay has an identical twin named Bob. My sister sees Jay at the bar with his hand on another woman. The woman calls the man Jay. Bob agrees his name is Jay.\n\nY'all don't think that's gonna raise some issues?", "Rape by deception also uses the phrase informed consent.\n\n\nNice ad hominem, I suppose.", "Arguably it is about as close to being that exact same person since identical twin,  but yeah I get that point. Just seems weird to me this person that knows the original(who is trying to sleep with a married man) didn't manage to figure it out.", "He worked toward forgiveness for his brother as he still has love for him. There is no love for his ex, so he doesn't want to work on forgiving her. \n\nYou speak as though forgiveness is completely logical. It isn't. Emotions play a large factor here.", "One acted in malicious revenge, the other acted in stupid manner but was not trying to do any intentional harm to the OP.", "He didn't pretend it was OK. He didn't talk to his brother for years and knocked him to the ground. And mind this is his identical twin, breaking that bond for years isn't an easy thing.\n\nHis brother acted in a stupid irresponsible manner, but he wasn't being malicious or intending to harm his brother, even if he did so inadvertently.\n\nThe wife DID take malicious revenge, not only cheating but also trying her best to wreck his career/life.\n\nThere is a significantly large difference between these two so it is very easy to see why he could forgive his brother.", ">Just saying she was convinced you no longer wanted/loved her, first.\n\nAnd she has now made that a reality", "Brother magically made Amanda sleep with another man and throw it into OP's face instead of confronting him and/or filing for divorce like a rational person?\n\nMan he really is that good of an actor huh, for poor Amanda to lose all sense of personal accountability. /s", "They aren't equally responsible. \n\nAmanda had vows. She was married to OP. SHE threw that way. That makes her much more responsible; she was his person and should have trusted him. She knew he had a twin; it's not as though Steve was a secret. It never occurred to her that it could have been Steve? The fact she immediately thought it was OP shows how much she didn't trust him. \n\nOn top of that, of the things that she could have done, she did the WORST.\n\nSteve simply didn't confirm that he wasn't OP; the woman who came up to him assumed and he didn't correct her. He was exiled for years for his part.\n\nOP still loves his brother and was willing to work towards forgiveness. He no longer loves Amanda and doesn't want to work towards forgiveness for her.", "That is no excuse for going straight up nuclear over essentialy a rumour. I can see it raising an issue, sure, but not in that manner. \n\nI'm also quite sure OP's brother didn't mean anything malicious, while his ex absolutely did want to inflict maximum damage, so it makes sense why he'd forgive one and not the other", "[citation needed]", "Eek. That first sentence. No, no, no. Very, very problematic. \n\nAnd drunk, on a night out, maybe an easy mistake to make.", "Uh huh. All I was doing in my comment was to give you insight. Not trying to convince you of anything else. \n\nWhatever pain you went through, she went through as well. And because you weren't around to yell at, she harbored it.\n\nHer behavior was wrong. She should have divorced you instead of cheating. That's on her. \n\nBest of luck as you heal.", "It's not even a rumor is the thing. OP's wife had a witness who saw the brother assume the identity of her husband. That's direct proof in her mind.\n\nAgain, I don't support revenge cheating,\n\nAnd now that you've got me thinking about it, it's actually super messed up that the twin used OP's identity to get laid because that means two things:\n\n1. The woman he slept with knew that OP was married and was still down to hook up. She then may have told anyone afterwards that she slept with OP (speculation on my part honestly - no direct proof of the hookup telling people but still)\n\n2. The woman actually did not consent to sleeping with the twin. She consented to sleeping with OP. So she was tricked into sleeping with another guy under false pretenses.", "I'm not talking about a legal definition of anything. It's a commonly used phrase. Do you need proof that people have used that phrase in conversations about consent? Or do you think you have some gotcha moment?", "Used in context of taking condoms off, belief someone is on BC, belief someone is *who they say they are* are all included. You can't consent without all the information.", "Am an identical twin, it is very problematic but true. Appearance, personality, genetically about as identical as you can get. Is very ick though yes.", "What a waste of time to somehow believe that she was hurt just as much as OP.\n\nShe cheated on him off a lie, instead of taking the time to ascertain the truth. \n\nOP walked in on her with another man and had her throw it in his face without remorse.\n\nThey weren't the same circumstances or the same pain, at all.", "But the question that should be asked , did the cousin hear the brother say he was op, or did she just see him and think it was op. As it stands, the cousin has had her nose in the relationship since the beginning and had already caused problems before.", "It's not.", "yeah the actual term is \"rape by deception\". possibly some other fools like you misuse medical terms though.", "I agree about not the same circumstances. I disagree about pain.\n\nI've been cheated on plenty. That pain has nothing to do with what I do next. (Never cheated, in case you think of going there). But that pain is as real as any heartbreak.\n\nI'm just saying there's a difference between reason and justification. Not justifying her actions.", "\"Informed consent\" is literally what describes the victims. They either give informed or uninformed consent, language isn't set in stone", "But you knew you were being cheated on...? Like if someone you trusted told you that your SO cheated, you would still want to make sure of that fact. And as you said, nothing excuses what she chose to do with that information so what does \"her pain\" matter when it wasn't true in the first place?"]}
