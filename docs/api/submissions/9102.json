{"id": 9102, "submission_id": "10th5su", "title": "AITA For Forgiving My Brother But Not My Ex-Wife", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (40m) have an identical twin brother \"Steve\" and used to be married to my high school sweetheart \"Amanda\" (40f). I proposed to her after high school but when we told our parents they felt that we were too young and convinced us to at least wait until college as the stress of grades could effect the relationship.\n\nDuring sophomore year I decided to drop out and enlist in the military since I was unwilling to sign up for any debt. Amanda didn't like the idea of seeing me even less but I assured her that it would only be temporary, we'd still get married after she finished college, and listed all the benefits of me joining the military. She was starting to warm up to the idea, until her nosey drama loving cousin told her about all the cheating stories and told me that if I didn't get out of enlistment we were over. She told me this the day before I was scheduled to report for training and fly off for basic training. I had to go.\n\nThe break up only lasted a few weeks and I officially proposed to Amanda after training was done. We got married and started living our lives hoping from base to base over the years and had kids. However after our second child was born Amanda started longing for home and we moved back.\n\nWe bought a house back in our home state but I had to be stationed somewhere else for a few months in order to go live there. It was hard but Amanda and I made it work. During this time I made friends with a female co-worker but nothing ever happened. I told Amanda I was arriving later than what I actually was so I could both surprise her and be well rested. I stayed with a buddy of mine on base and I actually spent part of the day helping a superior officer put together a bedroom set for her daughter.\n\nWhen I arrived home I walked in on my wife and another man. Thank goodness my buddy was there with me otherwise I might've gone to jail. I was furious but Amanda didn't show any remorse and then proceeded to tell me that she knew I had cheated and would be reporting me for it. I was so confused.\n\nApparently, Steve pretended to be me so he could get laid and that's who Amanda's nosey cousin saw and after it was revealed that I had lied about my actual return date, Amanda wanted revenge. Steve immediately confessed and apologized and after my superior officer and friend gave their statements I was cleared of everything. I filed for divorced, kept contact with Amanda down to a bare minimum, and didn't speak to Steve for years.\n\nEventually Steve and I made up and we're good now but Amanda thought that I had finally forgiven her too and was upset when I stated that I didn't. Her cousin is calling me sexist and that I'm being a bad dad for treating the mother of my children so coldly. AITA?\n\nEdit: Since people are asking and/or have questions let me try to clarify\n\nWhen my brother was out at a club a girl \"recognized\" Steve from a social media post and started chatting with him. She assumed Steve was and just didn't correct her. That was how he pretended to be me. They hooked up by the end of the night and that was that. As identical twins Steve and I had a habit of either pretending to be each other or letting people assume we were the other person because it was fun. Once Steve found out what happened he immediately confessed and was very apologetic. I eventually forgave him because, in spite of everything, I still loved and missed my brother. I don't love or miss Amanda. I can't explain it but after seeing her with another man in our house something in me clicked and love started to die.\n\nEdit 2: Because we have kids, I'm forced to still communicate with Amanda. For their sake I'm civil but cold. I don't say anything beyond \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye,\" I don't ask how she's doing, I have her blocked everywhere on social media, and unless it has something to do with the kids I don't acknowledge and/or respond to anything she has to say.\n\nEdit 3: Yes, I DNA tested my kids, they're mine. Amanda even had the audacity to be upset over it.\n\nAlso no Steve and Amanda never slept together and Steve said he only pretended to be me to get laid once.  \n\n\nI also mentioned the female co-worker because Amanda always felt threatened by our closeness and tried to get her in trouble with the military too. My colleague shortly retired after the incident and came out as gay. To the best of my knowledge Amanda never apologized to her.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1675519523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10th5su/aita_for_forgiving_my_brother_but_not_my_exwife/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother's actions caused Amanda's unwarranted paranoia which she used to cheat on you. Had your brother not pretended to be you, she likely wouldn't have cheated.

Meh.", "I don't disagree but he's asking for reaction on this specific story. \nShe cheated on him but his brother was happy to jeopardise his relationship, and let everyone believe he was a cheater.\nIn my view I'd find my brother's betrayal worse. \nIn practice obviously OP can forgive whoever he wants.

Stop it. She had a choice on how to deal with the (false)information her nosy cousin gave her and she made the choice to cheat and then threaten him to ruin his career. Ops brother didnt make her do that, its on her.", ">  Had your brother not pretended to be you, she likely wouldn't have cheated. \n\nI honestly don't understand this point. If the cousin didn't tell her, she likely wouldn't had cheated.  If he didn't leave for the military, she likely wouldn't had cheated.  If they weren't married, she likely wouldn't had cheated (not sure how it would be possible).  \n\nI mean, brother did something wrong but there were a whole lot of other reactions to this than sleeping with someone else, like arguing with the OP to explain himself.  Effectively what happened was that the cousin said something and she, a married person, then sleep with someone else.", "Regardless of what my brother did Amanda still made the choices she did.

And yes, the fact it\u2019s a movie does sort of support my point here; would this all likely happen in reality? I think the probability is extremely low. \n\nPlus it doesn\u2019t really make sense: why did Steve have to pretend to be OP if Steve was sleeping with someone who *wasn\u2019t* OP\u2019s wife? That part isn\u2019t explained and i feel it\u2019s kind of critical to understanding the whole story. \n\nYeah, fair point re my flair, but I think I have read a fair few fictional pieces, which is why I think I\u2019m possibly right about this one being fake. \ud83d\ude02", "Also blackmail issues.

And being military spouse with kids is always stressful to begin with. It's likely she wasn't really meant to do all this with you. She probably felt compelled to have a family with you, accept your decisions to enlist, or lose you.  And she made the choice to pick love without really being logical about her life choices in your relationship. But she was young. So were you.", "This makes the most sense.", "Honestly, with how ready she was to \"revenge\" cheat on him id say she was probably looking for any excuse. But sure, blame the brother who actually took responsibility and apologised for his actions. You could just as well say if it wasnt for ex-wifes nosy cousins actions none of this would have hapened because ex-wife wouldnt know about what OPs brother did. In the end, her actions are 100% on her."]}
