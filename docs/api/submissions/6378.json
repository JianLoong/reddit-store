I (24f) have been dating my gf (25f) let's call her Jane, for a year now. I'm very happy with her, the problem is my best friend Alice (37f). \n\nAlice and I met in group therapy, we started hanging out and have been close friends for 3ish years now. She's like a big sister to me. \nOn to the issue. Since I started dating Jane, I also started a new job, made new friends and honestly have finally been thriving after years of depression. \n\nBut all that change also meant that I had a lot less time for Alice, since I was trying to juggle working full time, spending time with Jane, meeting friends and getting enough me time and time for self care. \nAlice has told me a few times that she wants to see me more and that her kids (m7 and f11) miss me. I've been there for every important event, every birthday and visited on Christmas Day. I thought I was doing fine. \n\nA few days before Christmas Alice asked what I was doing on NYE. I told her I wasn't sure yet but that I would definitely be with Jane. She told me what she was planning on doing with the kids and her bf and asked if we wanted to come. I told her I'd talk to Jane about it.\n\nJane said she didn't want to go there, that she'd like if we spend NYE with mutual friends and she didn't want to see Alice. The two had had an argument that boils down to Alice giving a shirt to Jane in like June. I was there when Alice told her to keep it. Apparently Alice later told Jane that she did want it back. \nWell Jane doesn't remember that and the shirt got lost when she moved apartments recently. When Alice asked for it back a few month ago, me and Jane were both surprised. Alice got really angry accused Jane of stealing, Jane got upset cause Alice screamed at her etc. Jane offered to replace the shirt but Alice refused. \n\nSo that's why Jane wanted to do something else with me and I understand. I told Alice that we wouldn't be there, her first reply was rather cold. \nI tried to talk to her about it and she said that Jane never liked our friendship, that she was trying to take me away from her and that I was codependent and would do anything Jane told me to. \n\nI tried to defend Jane while also making it clear that I care about Alice, it kinda made things worse and Alice said some very hurtful things.\n\nI'm overwhelmed by this whole thing and don't know if I did the right thing. What made me feel bad is that Alice said her and the kids miss me and that the kids keep asking about me and I can't just leave them like that and only show up when I can make some time.\n\nSo...

She is 110% using her kids to guilt trip and manipulate you into spending time with her, and that's not okay.\n\nI would definitely put some distance between yourself and Alice, and then maybe talk to YOUR mental health professional about the most appropriate way to proceed while not compromising anyone involved's mental health.", "NTA. It seems that Alice is the one causing trouble and trying to drive a wedge between you and Jane. I don't know if she's doing it on purpose or subconsciously, but she's doing it.", "NTA\n\nAlice calls you co-dependent but in fact it sounds like she is just demanding you be dependent on her instead of Jane.\n\nNow I don't know if you're co-dependent but most friends understand when their friends commit time to their S/O and especially at special events like Christmas and NYE.", "NTA\n\nAnd the fact you\u2019ve witnessed Alice turn a non issue into an issue and deny things were said should be the catalyst for you to see the red flag \ud83d\udea9 \n\nI\u2019d be distancing myself from Alice if I were you, I suspect she\u2019s got a history of getting offside with people from pulling these kind of stunts", "NTA\n\nThis friendship is a bit odd, a bit manipulative, and reeks of codependency on Alice\u2019s part. I would set some clear boundaries ASAP with Alice and be prepared for her to handle it immaturely.", "NTA - I can't help but notice the age difference between you and Alice. It seem like she is unwilling to accept that you're in a different and healthier mental place than you have been before. Maybe Alice was a crucial part of this process, but it could seem like she needs you to be stagnate and be at the same place and in the same life situation as you were in before. A lack of understanding that you're in your twenties and your life will be very changeable (as is super normal at that age) seems to be prominent here from Alice. Maybe willful or not, but bounderies needs to be set, because she is crossing them and acting .. emotionally immature and frankly.. Odd.", "NTA. Your life has changed and involves more people to consider now.", "NTA \nSounds more like Alice is mad because you are not her only friend any more. I think, Alice is jealous of Jane and puts you in a bad place where she kinda makes you choose between them. Don\u2019t let her pressure you into this friendship. You seem to have a stable life build up after a bumpy road and you shouldn\u2019t let Alice tell you what to do. \nShe needs to understand that you make your own choices and that Jane ist an important part of your life now.", "NTA, people grow apart and that\u2019s ok, if you feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, both you and Alice should acknowledge that. However, Alice is using her kids to get what she wants from you, however true it may be that they miss you, she\u2019s still using them as leverage to get her way. Not cool imo. \n\nAt the end of the day, do what you think is best for you, good friends understand that everyone has their own lives. Rehearse a little speech for Alice about how you feel to try and make amends, but I don\u2019t thunk you owe her anything moving forward", "NTA \n\nFriendships wax and wane depending on where you are, and they are, in life!\n\nIt\u2019s natural. \n\nYou bonded through therapy. Then you get a lot better and are doing well for yourself and you drift away from those people. \n\nThat is just life", "NTA. Alice is toxic. She\u2019s weaponizing her kids, trying to drive a wedge between you and your girlfriend, and trying to guilt you. A real best friend doesn\u2019t do that. My best friend of 34 years lives in another country. We don\u2019t get to talk much, but we never guilt each other over it. We\u2019ve never tried to get in each other\u2019s relationship (even she was with a real asshole, I simply told her I thought he was a bad guy but I was always there for her). And we both know we still care for and love each other. Real friends understand that life gets busy. Things can change. Alice just sounds like she\u2019s jealous of Jane and other things taking up your time even though you\u2019ve made an effort to be there for important days. She also said hurtful things. I\u2019ve never said that to my friends, let alone my best friend. That\u2019s not okay.\n\nAlso, you did meet her in group therapy. I don\u2019t know why she was there, but she clearly needs more therapy. Live your happy life. Let her stew in whatever she has going on.", "NTA \n\n\nIt isn't Jane that's codependent. \n\n\nIt's OK to have more than one friend.", "No the asshole, sounds like Alice needs clearer friend boundaries too.", "NTA. You're doing your best.  \nI'd guess that Alice is feeling jealous and insecure, and is lashing out because of it. It's immature, at her age, but that's what I bet is happening.\n\nIf you want to maintain a relationship with Alice, can I suggest a regular friend-date? Like, brunch every other Tuesday or something silly like that. Just some regular thing that the two of you do routinely. It will probably improve her behaviour.  \nIt's totally your call IF you want to maintain a relationship with Alice. A really good friend would be happy for you that your life is getting so happy and full. This is not a good friend kinda move on her part.", "NTA. \n\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone your time other than the people you decide to. There\u2019s obviously priorities and your partner would be ranked higher than Alice.\n\n\nYou asked your partner and decided not to visit Jane. Had you guys gone, there might have been a different scenario to deal with.", "Hell no alice messed up you know she messed up and she does not want to admit it she needs to get her shit together and if she cannot accept money to keep the the relationship with jane just a tiny bit good. Alice needs to grow up. It looks like to me she is trying to break up you and Jane.", "NTA - Friendships change and evolve and a good friend would be happy for your new relationship not jealous. As for the incident between her and Jane, it's odd that even with you voicing what you heard Alice was still accusing Jane. Then not accepting a replacement even though that's above what Jane should even need to do makes it seem like Alice was purposely trying to gaslight you. It's manipulating and not what a real friend does to someone they care about. \n\nI think your friendship with Alice has run it's course. It's great that you had a friend with you in group therapy but it seems like you might be in very different places in your lives outside of group and that's OK. Sounds like Alice has a lot to work out individually with her therapist regarding control in relationships and boundries. You can't help her with that, you can just focus on you and your girlfriend.\n\nEdit for clarity", "NTA \n\nIf you ignore how you met Alice for a second (I think this is making you feel more guilty) then the situation is still rubbish but actually a normal part of most peoples social lives as they get older. Friendships change when things get busier or your circumstances become different and you\u2019re describing a situation where your friend doesn\u2019t want anything to change due to her own insecurities. \n\nQuality of relationships isn\u2019t just about the amount of time you spend together but your description of Alice is that she\u2019s attempting to guilt you into more contact, lashing out when you don\u2019t go along and generally just not being that good of a friend to you anymore. \n\nYou\u2019re grateful to Alice for being there for you but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re shackled to her. \n\nINFO: do you feel obliged to spend time with Alice OR do you feel no pressure and just want to?", "NTA, and there's probably a good reason she's not friends with people in similar circumstances to her. Does she really not get that two 20 year-olds would rather party on NYE than hang out with her family?", "Nta\n\nYour friend is the codependent one. She doesn\u2019t want to share you with your gf and so she is creating issues to try and drive you two apart. This is not a healthy friendship", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good decision. Now stick to it. Don't let Alice guilt you into being controlled by her. Sure the kids miss you but they don't have the right to set your schedule and co tool where you go on holidays.", "NTA time to let that friendship go.", "Codependent? For wanting to spend NYE with your romantic partner? That is definitely a holiday it\u2019s expected to spend with your partner lol. Alice is dependent on you and she just doesn\u2019t want you dating Jane for whatever reason. She\u2019s projecting. Some space might be the best idea tbh. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm going to say this as someone who was in a very similar situation a couple years back, if Alice doesn't get help and fix her dependency issues, then you need to drop her because she won't stop.\n\nI know Alice means a lot to you and you helped each other through a terrible time, but the one thing you have to look out for with friends met during times of pain and recovery is them ripping you away from your progress because they are anchored to you. \n\nI met someone I considered a friend during a really lonely and terrible time in my life. I'll call her Jessica. Jessica was also going through similar and we shared a lot of the same interests, so we befriended each other quickly. She meant the world to me to start and it was one of those \"it's like we knew each other all our lives\" sorta deals.\n\nShe was supportive...but I realized really fast how needy she actually was and that no matter how many doors I helped open for her, she would never step out to improve her situation. Which I mean...that's depression for you. But she would self sabotage herself which conflicted a lot with my eventual own improvement when it turned into attempts to sabotage me. As things got better for me, she got upset. And when things slid back, she was there to drown me with love. But if I slid back too far and isolated like my depression tends to do with me when I get really bad, she'd explode about how my backsliding is hurting her. \n\nWhat ended it was me realizing just how angry and mean she had become since I wasn't around her all the time. Iwasn't hanging out online as much anymore (I got work, I had IRL stuff going on, my partner and I were spending more time together as our own mental health issues started to get better). She tried to tell me I was a terrible friend for getting better like I had and then she dropped the bomb on me she was angry my partner and I got help. Why? Because she was hoping my mental health would get worse and we'd break up so she'd take a primary role in my life.\n\nAlice is not your partner. And her expecting priority over your partner for a single holiday you decided not to spend with her because of her animosity towards your gf speaks volumes.\n\nIf she doesn't get help, cut ties.", "NTA\nAlice is in fact jealous of your relationship. \nAlice has issues .\nAlice is using her children to guilt you.", "Alice is gross bro get rid of Alice", "I'll see my therapist next week and will definitely talk to her about it.", "Yup, picking fights with the SO then blaming them for the resulting mutual dislike, using her kids as weapons of emotional manipulation, demanding a *lot* of holidays from someone who is only a friend and yet still claiming OP is not giving her enough time and attention,\nmaking OP feel bad about having a healthier mental health status and social circle... whole lotta not-the-behaviour-of-a-friend stuff going on here.", "That's such a good idea! I definitely have a lot to think about regarding the friendship but that might help fix things", "That's a good question.... I'm not sure. I do want to spend time with her and I really love her kids. But lately I've mostly felt guilty and like I should be seeing them more than I have been.", "Look. Let's leave out that conflict between Alice and Jane for a second because that'd open a whole new can of worms that I don't want to deal with right now.  Instead let me give you a little pieces of general advice on therapy friendships from my own experience. \n\nTherapy friendships are honest friendships. That's because they come from a place of mutual openness and shared pain and friendships with fellow patients are incredibly valuable. \n\nHowever, those friendships tend to not last in the long run. Why? My guess is you're at a similar point in life when you first meet, and that similarity becomes the foundation of your relationship. Then after awhile you head in different directions at different speeds, and the relationship crumbles. It's not even anyones fault. What was once so precious to you suddenly makes you feel stuck, you're not good for each other anymore. And while sad, I found that this seems to be the natural way and that it's often better to let go and part ways than cling to something that doesn't work anymore. \n\nI don't say there's no exceptions to this (I married a former fellow patient lol) but it reads to me like this is what's happening to you and Alice right now. It's not Jane, it's not Alice's kids, it's not that she's not important to you anymore. It's none of this. It's just a friendship that was helpful once and has now slowly run it's course. \n\nCaveat, I'm only guessing from your short post and my own experience, and this is not necessarily true for your situation! But I encourage you to take your time evaluating if what I said rings true to you, and if it does, maybe it's time to mourn and then move on. I wish you all the best!"]}
