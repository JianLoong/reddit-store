Jacob and I met through a mutual friend. It has just been a casual relationship so far. We have gone out on a couple dates and have also hooked-up on those occasions. I know that Jacob has been seeing another girl (I\u2019ll refer to her as Ashley) for a few months, and, according to Jacob, their relationship is also casual. However, I started getting suspicious that things were more than just casual from some things I heard from the mutual friend that had set Jacob and I up. So I decided to reach out directly to Ashley to ask if I was \u201cstepping on any toes\u201d by hanging out with Jacob. This is exactly what I said:\n\n\u201cHey, Ashley. I just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t stepping on any toes by hanging out with Jacob. I respect you and the relationship you have with Jacob, so I don\u2019t want to disrupt anything you two have going.\u201d\n\nAshley never responded to me, but instead called Jacob and started cussing him out. Jacob, in turn, then called me and yelled at me over the phone. He told me that their relationship was none of my business and that I should have never reached out to Ashley. I apologized right away because I felt bad, and because I wanted him to stop yelling. Over the next week, his attitude towards me was cold and indifferent. When I confronted him about it, he said that he was still annoyed with me. I apologized again, but nothing seemed to change. However, after awhile I realized that I really didn\u2019t have to apologize for anything, and that it was him who should be apologizing for his childish behavior towards me. All I wanted wanted was clear communication between everyone involved, and I was in no way responsible for Ashley\u2019s reaction to my message. I told him my thoughts via text and his reaction was explosive. To summarize his reaction, he basically told me that I was a c*nt and that I was just a \u201chook-up\u201d. He said that all the drama that had happened between all of us was my fault. Am I the bad guy in this situation???\n\nTo clear some things up\u2026I thought we were fyb. Jacob also talked to me about future plans he had that sometimes included me. He even asked if he could be a +1 to a wedding I was attending (he asked if he could be my +1). Also, he said that he wanted me to meet his family.\n\nFor those who are asking\u2026 Ashley and Jacob were never in an exclusive relationship as far as I know. But all I know is what Jacob tells me. \n\nAlso, I have ended things with him a few days ago.", "created_utc": 1686101366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142zig0/aita_for_reaching_out_to_the_other_woman/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's an AH too.", "I actually would really appreciate it!! I always appreciate people who communicate", "Let's say he was telling the truth. \n\nYou're Ashley you have a causal sexual relationship with someone. Would you want someone messaging you saying how they are also having sex with them?", "No, neither of them did admit that. I never talked directly to Ashley, though (except from when I first texted her). All the information I received was from Jacob. It\u2019s when the mutual friend told me things that she had heard about Ashley and Jacob\u2019s relationship that I started to worry.", "Op didn't prove he lied though.  Kinda funny everyone who asked OP if they were in a relationship she's not answering.", "You read all that and thought\n\n \"Oh yeah, the other women was clearly in the loop\" did you?", "She was just mad that I contacted her. To my knowledge, she knew about me.", "I was under the impression that we were fyb and not a hookup. He also talked to me about future plans that included me.", "He had more than FWB behavior though. Plus one to a wedding\u2026..future plans talk with in her still the picture in some fashion.", "There's A few options. OP could\n\n- trust what Jacob says about Ashley and that relationship\n\n- ask Ashley about it\n\n- stick with the status quo regardless of what OP thinks is the type of relationship with Ashley\n\n- drop Jacob\n\nI would choose the last option, but...", "He would have told me what he had already told me that they were just \u201ccasual\u201d.

That would mean he\u2019s cheating.", "OP commented that the other woman was mad that she reached out at all, not that there was another woman so... yes? The fact that she didn't plan on breaking it off is odd if she genuinely thought they may have been more serious.  Either way, staying with him AND reaching out to her seemed like not a great move.", "Then yeah, you're the asshole.", "Uhhhh fwb and hookups are basically the exact same thing", "To me this shows\" the other woman\" was just a fwb. Because truthfully who brings their side chick to a wedding when you have a gf lol.", "Isn't that slut shaming?   \n\nBut not really either way. If he's cheating yea he's wrong. But if he's sleeping with both and admitted it to OP she was not the only one. What's wrong with that?", "No I don't think he's lying but you do. Which is why I put it that way.  \n\nSo if you had a casual fling would you want their other sexual partners messaging you for details of your relationship?  \n\nBecause to me the other woman responded like a casual fling. Didn't ask for details of OP relationship but instead basically went to the guy saying \"get your girl\"", "I mean, why would the other women be so annoyed if she was also just a fwb type situation? Even if she was annoyed at the reminder that her lover wasn't hers alone, that feels like a her problem to me.", "To be fair, she hasn\u2019t talked to this other women. She also didn\u2019t say she was having sex, which she is. If she\u2019s that mad about a possible relationship, what about when she finds out they been having sex at the same exact time with the same exact dude. \ud83e\udd2e", "I mean I don\u2019t view a person I hook-up with as a friend. It\u2019s usually a one time thing. Jacob and I slept with each other multiple times.", "I disagree.  Friends with bennies is you can still hang out sometimes.  A hook up is strictly sex.  Unless thats changed.  Anyone else???", "She was attending he wanted to be HER plus one.", "[deleted]", "Bro. The moment you get intimate with someone is the moment anything can happen. If you don\u2019t like the possibilities of what can happen. Just don\u2019t do it. This is all on him. And who gets pissed if it\u2019s an open relationship? No one\u2026.", "Because that's kind of an invasion of privacy. She doesnt know her like that. Why does she get to reach out to her about her sex and romantic life? I dunno, I think it'd be really uncomfortable and unnecessary if OP actually trusted him. And again, if she didn't, she should have broken it off and sent a \"just FYI, I don't know if he was being truthful, but he says you guys are in a casual relationship and I don't trust him so I'm bouncing.\" It sounds more like she was prodding to see if she was the primary or other woman... I said light YTA because I don't think OP handled it well. If she'd been more thoughtful and intentional, I'd probably be giving a different answer.", "He was honest about their existence. If she doesn't want to run the risk of that, then set a boundary. Doesn't mean it's cool to reach out to her. Other woman isn't in a relationship or casual situationship with OP. It's really none of her business... unless she had real concerns, in which case I think she would have still handled it poorly.", "I think it's all semantics.", "You did insinuate that he's sleeping with too many people but what's wrong with sleeping with multiple people if you're telling them which he did. \n\nMy opinion is OP is in love with the dude. Ashley just a friend with benefits and didn't want to ve involved in the drama.", "They are both fucking the same person, that is their connection. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think I get what you mean.\n\nBut checking the guy isn't a liar is a basic part of building trust. It's something every other mistress wished they had done.", "Disagree.  Hookups are not to see the light of day sometimes.  Relegated to secrecy.  Frie ds with benefits can go see a movie or have a meal...attend a wedding together say.  You don't do these things with someone you are just hooking up with.  Not mutually exclusive."]}
