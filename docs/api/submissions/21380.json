Some of the girls post sexy pics.\n\nToday I commented that a friend said some of my old IG posts are risqu\u00e9 and asked how my bf feels about it. So I asked him how he feels when I wear short shorts and bikinis. Mind you, those posts are from 10 years ago. I\u2019m more conservative now (mostly because I gained weight and those things don\u2019t look the same on me).\n\nHis response was that he prefer I don\u2019t wear revealing things. Please keep in mind that he is not possessive, has never once said you can\u2019t wear this or that. He would never, ever bring this up. \n\nI also have no intentions of wearing revealing clothes, but I\u2019d like to say something like, \u201cif you can follow girls on social media that dress this way I feel like I should be able to as well.\u201d \n\nBut is this too immature and passive aggressive?

He also didn't tell you why, so before you get so up tight perhaps you should get that bit of information first.  You also do not know why he followed those girls on social media...not sure if you even know when he did since you didn't specify ...he is 34 could have done it years ago for reasons that wouldn't matter so much now.....also I don't think you really understand the definition of passive aggressive (which is indirectly expressing your displeasure) or maybe I think what you want to say to him is more blunt than you think it is.", "There's basically no problem, but OP wants to create one.

You say you don't want to or have any intention to wear revealing clothes, but asked your BF his opinion about it anyway. When he kindly told you \"I prefer you don't\" your response is he never said I can't, but \"I should be able to if I want to?\" \n\nIt just sounds like you don't like him following certain girls on Instagram. Why is it a such a big deal? You've been together a year just talk to him.", "YTA You went through all of his friends on IG and analyzed whether you were okay with their clothing or not. That is stalkerish. Than you try to manipulate him in saying things, you admit he would never bring up, if he wouldn\u2019t have been tricked by you. Now you\u2019re planning on using these words you manipulated him into saying against him. \n\nWhy do you do this? This would be fucked up if you did want to wear revealing clothes, but you don\u2019t even want to. Is it because you like drama? If you don\u2019t like your BF anymore just break up, but don\u2019t play mind games, just because you can.\n\nEdit: Just realized you\u2019re 30(!).

And If it\u2019s not, that they support u wearing whatever you want regardless of how they feel about it and never make you feel bad about what you wear. Sounds like he does that already so what do you want him to say? He told u what he thinks and I highly doubt he\u2019d hate it if u dressed differently but then again you aren\u2019t comfortable in those clothes anymore anyway\u2026so again don\u2019t put these two things together.

The point was she was asking if she should/could dress like that because he apparently likes others who do. She's now 'more conservative' and has 'no intention' of dressing differently. Sounded to me like she was trying him a bit ... looking for a reaction or his actual feelings/opinion on the matter. That, too, is her prerogative. She asked. He answered. He gave his opinion; he didn't say 'no.' Now she's asking us if she was immature or whatever for bringing it up etc. I melt linked out the reason a lot of men look at such content. It's part of our human nature. Men, women ... all of us do it; we look and evaluate others attractiveness. Again, she wasn't looking to dress different. She was looking for info as to why he's looking at (or at least following) others online. Maybe she should've just asked more directly about those he follows online instead of posing the hypothetical.", "I made a general point!
