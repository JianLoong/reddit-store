I haven't gone looking, but the girls sometimes show up on my explore page as local celebrity types and there's my bf in the likes. I don't look like them. But, I also sometimes read romance novels of dudes who act in ways that my bf would not - its not him. Those girls aren't me. But we're with each other, we picked each other, and I have zero reason to believe he wants them or that they have anything to do with our relationship, just like my romance novels. \n\nHe's liking their pictures, but he's watering my garden for me, fixing my car, playing with my nephews etc. I would choose him any day over grand romantic gestures in my novels because day to day he makes my life better with all the little things that make up our relationship. And I'm assuming, he's with me for the same reasons - he seems to like who I am and makes it clear he wants me in his life, so there's no need for me to worry about who I'm not. We made our choices, and chose each other. \n\nAssuming you otherwise feel good and happy in this relationship, YWBTA if you didn't let the ig girls go. He's not with them. Social media, romance novels - all shit that ain't real.

The memes about 'hey everyone, just want to take a moment to talk about mental health!' while doing the full on boobs and butt pose are true.\n\n> Today I commented that a friend said some of my old IG posts are risqu\u00e9 and asked how my bf feels about it. So I asked him how he feels when I wear short shorts and bikinis. Mind you, those posts are from 10 years ago.

Not stalking like at all lol.\n\nI would not say it passive aggressively but focus on how what he said makes you feel in the relationship.

Do you know them personally? Would you consider unfollowing them as it makes me uncomfortable?\"\n\nAlso, instagram is not real life. Carefully posed pics of someone in a risque outfit doesn't mean that's what it really looks like on them. Imagine them doing chores in it.

Why lure him into a conversation just to talk to him about the REAL thing that is on your mind which is the Instagram girls. Just be straight forward about THAT.

If it bothers you or even if you\u2019re just curious then just say you happened to notice it and ask if he actually knows any of them.", "YWBTA because you only want to dress that way to spite him? What did he actively do to you for you to give him a passive aggressive ultimatum like that? Girl I get it, you don\u2019t want to seem possessive for controlling his followers but you\u2019re fine being petty? He likely wouldn\u2019t even know wha that snide comment was referring too. Just have a conversation, it is a tough one to have but if him following those accounts makes you uncomfortable just ask him about it and tell him honestly and I\u2019m not such an immature way. I told my bf they hand ful of accounts he was following hurt my ego and felt disrespectful, I also wouldn\u2019t ask him to do anything I don\u2019t do bc I also don\u2019t thirst after men or even celebs on ig so make sure you\u2019re doing the same. I never asked my bf to unfollow just told him how I felt to see his likes on some model posts and he unfollowed them on his own. Randoms shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for him to let go of. Obvs he can follow some attractive and verified athletes and vloggers but you can tell when they have an unhealthy attachment to these random women and when the real girl in their life matters enough they\u2019ll let that go in a heartbeat. Hope you can find a better way to go about this !", ">But is this too immature and passive aggressive?\n\nYes. It's very immature. You're just creating unnecessary drama.

That is his spank bank,\n\nNow what you need to understand is that you are HIS girlfriend (read: property), and he does not want YOU to dress and post in skimpy outfits, because then other disgusting cretins will follow you so that you can be in THEIR spank banks.  \n\n\nNTA  \nDump this perv and wear what you want.", "YTA.    You sound really immature and very insecure about yourself.   So what if your bf follows girls on IG?  He doesn't know them, isn't trying to get with them.   You say you had posts 10 years ago where you also wore skimpy clothes but you don't because you gained weight and that style wouldn't look good on you.
