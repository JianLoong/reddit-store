For some context: the friend and my bf are very close and have known each other since long before we started dating. Well, after we had seen Oppenheimer and before Barbie, the friend made a random comment that came in the middle of no where. It was that Florence Pugh has nicer tits than I do. \n\nNow, right off the bat, first thing to come to mind is like, \u201coh, of course she does, she\u2019s a celebrity.\u201d But not only is this random girl making this random comment, my boyfriend said nothing about it. I let this one slide. But she wouldn\u2019t stop. She then said that I don\u2019t even come close to comparing with Margot Robbie. To this, my boyfriend disagreed and said that I am very pretty. In that moment, I thought, \u201cthis girl doesn\u2019t even compare to ME. Who does she even think she is, saying all this stuff about me?\u201d It sucked being told such mean things regarding my appearance, as I already am a pretty insecure person. \n\nBut, anyways, we started watching the Barbie movie. At this point, as I\u2019m sure you can tell, I was feeling kinda gross. About myself, about the people with whom I had surrounded myself, etc.. My boyfriend tried to comfort me, putting his arm around me for a good chunk of the film. Well, the movie got to the scene where the mom was giving her speech on what it means to be a woman and feminism and stuff like that. This scene really moved me as I related to a lot of what was being discussed. And then the worst possible thing happened. My boyfriend started to laugh at the speech. I instinctually removed myself from under his arm and sat pushed away for the rest of the movie. Afterwards when I would make attempts at talking about how it made me feel and the broader implications of him not taking it seriously, our friend would jump to his defense, excusing what he did because it \u201cwas probably just uncomfortable\u201d or \u201creally isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201d She brought up the fact that, as she is trans and hasn\u2019t been a woman for her entire life, she still views a lot of it from a male perspective. So I said that, if she thinks that she has a male perspective, then it isn\u2019t really fair to decide that isn\u2019t a big deal to her specifically. After this whole exchange, I distanced myself from them both. She later apologized for being a dick and just really contentious all day.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1690958986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g1cmu/aita_for_not_letting_my_bf_mock_the_barbie_movie/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, by pretending to accept behavior that you find offensive, you are damaging yourself and actually being a bigger asshole bc you are faking liking people who actually make you feel insecure and who you do not share common values and interests with. Anyone can enjoy some very basic stuff together. But when it comes to more specific things like valuing being kind, having compassion, and being aware of social issues- those are core beliefs. And, you need to surround yourself with people who recognize those beliefs AND RESPECT those beliefs on a level that matches your own. \n\nYou need to honor your true, authentic self.

You will come off as condescending as like this is coming out of nowhere bc you've been pretending not to care about some things. Rather than continue to disregard your true, authentic self, you should start honoring your true personality.

And honestly, I could see myself responding the same way if I am strongly emotionally identifying with something and I perceive that someone I am close to is taking it as a joke. Not saying it is right, but it is an understandable human and flawed response. \n\nUltimately, it is not worth damaging your relationship over if it\u2019s something so trite. However, if this is really bothering you, have a calm 1:1 conversation with your boyfriend.

Your bf's friend is an AH. Total AH. There was absolutely no need for her to start commenting on your appearance and especially not your breasts. She then tries to jump in on an argument you were having with your bf...hell no. I think the friend is jealous of you tbh.\n\nYour bf also sounds like a jerk. If he laughs at that speech...hmm.

Honest question: since \"they haven't been a woman their entire life\" (NOTE: I'm using \"they\" because ima bit confused how the post describes this friend), does that make their comments all the more fall under sexual harrassment?\n\nSeriously, have a talk with your boyfriend.

I am saying this as a person who also sometimes gets the wrong reaction to a scene due to either finding some element of it incredulous or being nervous. I am very prone to nervous giggles (which makes my life quite miserable at some occasions )... Now I am not saying he was indeed nervous or something, just saying people do react differently to stuff and unless he vocalized a negative opinion regarding feminism in general, it should have no implications on how you see him. I agree a discussion afterward would be in place (however no accusations or anything, just some normal after-movie evaluation/conversation)  And I am not sure from your post you were calm and constructive afterward tbh....\n\nThat being said  I completely understand your frustration when they seemingly ganged up on you in the conversation, while you were already not very appreciative of the rude friend in the first place.", "The friend was out of line for the comments.

You can\u2019t take offence to someone else not viewing a movie the same way you do.
