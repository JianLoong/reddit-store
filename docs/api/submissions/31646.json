So obviously I\u2019m not using actual names here but will substitute my brothers name (20M) for Ethan and his GF (20F) for Sally. During thanksgiving dinner I (23M) was with my brother \u201cEthan\u201d and his GF \u201cSally\u201d at our giant family gathering as many families do. Next year\u2019s thanksgiving came up and I mentioned how I actually won\u2019t be at this thanksgiving next year because I am getting married this upcoming June and we will be splitting holidays. And my brother \u201cEthan\u201d said oh yeah that\u2019s right I forgot that, that\u2019s awesome, then he said \u201cwell that\u2019s going to suck for mom and dad a little as Sally and I are going to her families for thanksgiving\u201d to which I simply said \u201coh cool! You told mom and dad right\u201d. This single comment then turned into a firestorm later that night as Sally upon returning home cooped herself in my brothers room and cried that what I said made her feel \u201cdismissed, unwanted, and not included\u201d. Ethan tracked me down and told me this and I was surprised to say the least but I went and apologized as that is not at all what I meant but according to Ethan, I made her feel as if I don\u2019t view her as important to our family as I do my fianc\u00e9 soon to be wife. This is where things got a little more hairy as I called my brother on that saying it is different between having a fianc\u00e9/wife than having a girlfriend but I don\u2019t want that to be the topic of discussion as we sort this out with Sally. Now though my entire family is upset with me for \u201cexcluding\u201d Sally from my derogatory comments. For context, Sally and I have had troubles connecting and getting to know each other, part of the problem is lack of time seeing each other. At the end of all this I genuinely still don\u2019t know what I did wrong to warrant a reaction that I got and if she is being a little over dramatic from an innocent comment that I did not mean the way she took it and I apologized for in front of my entire family.\n\nTLDR: I asked if my brother had told my parents he was going to his significant others Thanksgiving which made his GF feel \u201cunwanted and like I didn\u2019t respect her\u201d to which I apologized but still my family is pissed with me. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n***edit for more context from a few comments I\u2019ve seen***\n\nSally and Ethan have been dating for 9ish months now", "created_utc": 1700833364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182sdeo/aita_brothers_gf_upset_with_me_please_help_me_i/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said, \"oh cool! You told mom and dad, right?\" to ask if your parents knew he'd be gone too. \n\nTHIS conversation made your brother's gf feel \"dismissed, unwanted, and not included?\" Your conversation wasn't about her, and it wasn't, frankly, any of her business. It was two brothers discussing next Thanksgiving and how their plans would affect *their* parents. \n\n**What does that conversation have to do with your brother's gf? Nothing, unless she thinks she's so important that your brother choosing to spend next Thanksgiving with her family is some huge drama that she's the starring in. She sounds exhausting. NTA.**", "What?? NTA. She got upset because you asked if your brother told your parents that he wont be at their thanksgiving next year? How in the world does that have anything to do with the girlfriend and WHAT exactly does she not feel included in? Sounds like she has seriously misunderstood something or she is making drama over literally nothing", "I read it twice and idk what you actually did. NTA", "NTA.  If she's so fragile that something like this impacts her this much, life is going to be very difficult.  You did nothing wrong.", "His GF might have got mad at the \"Oh, cool\" part of the comment.  She took it as you being happy she wouldn't be part of your families thanksgiving, hence all the drama about being excluded, etc.\n\nNTA.  If that is the reason, GF is a drama queen and an AH", "NTA from what I can make out. It sounds like Sally was expecting you to be demonstrably disappointed she wasn't coming on your family's behalf, and to make a fuss over her asking if they were sure they couldn't come or something like that. When you were accepting of their choices instead she took it as you having the opposite feeling of that she was hoping for -- as you not caring that she wasn't coming as you didn't think your family would miss her.\n\nIf so, it sounds exhausting. I wouldn't have apologized as that plays into the narrative they are setting up, with her as the tragic heroine. From now on, just be honestly bewildered about their attitude and calmly tell people what you said in the OP. You were simply accepting of their choices. That's it. Don't let them set you up as the villain in their silly melodrama.\n\n\\*Minor edits for clarity", "NTA, Sally seems to be overly dramatic, and possibly attention seeking. There was nothing you said that was wrong or unusual. It was simply about making the parents aware of planned absences at family holidays.  So if Sally was 'offended' then she must be twisting it into something else based on whatever perspective she carries in her own mind.  You cannot be expected to tiptoe around guessing at what she might find 'offensive' - especially when you said NOTHING that was actually 'about' her. You did not owe her any apology.", "NTA. Show your brother this thread. Sally's trouuuuuuble.", "NTA, Sally is a drama llama,  stop apologising and leave her be in her pity party.\n\nThis is why people should not apologise for the sake of it though, you did nothing wrong and apologising to her was, in her head, an admission that you were wrong and she was right and it just feeds the beast.", "INFO:\n\nWhat did Ethan and Sally say the specific issue was when you asked them how the comment could be considered derogatory? Like, obviously they misunderstood your question, which was the completely innocuous and innocent question of asking your brother if he told your parents that they wouldn't be attending Thanksgiving next year, so what was their explanation?\n\nClearly no one here can give you a legitimate ruling without knowing where the obvious miscommunication came into play.", "NTA. I always keep my family informed of where my husband and I will be for which holiday and he does the same. It\u2019s just common courtesy. Is there more to this story?

Giving parents a lot of heads up is expected so they can make alternate plans.", "NTA\n\nShe's upset because she's your brother's girlfriend?

Anything you say to your brother is going to get back to Sally, there could be quite a few good reasons (not necessarily your fault) she might be upset over your comment about finances being more important than girlfriends.", "Oh good grief, this is ridiculous. Sally needs to get over herself. NTA", "If she marries into your family... goooood luck!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOn't engage with that drama", "NTA.... avoid Sally. She is creating drama where there is none.\n\nLook up grey rock techniques- keep them in your tool kit", "So if I'm understanding this correctly, Sally's mad at you because you asked *your brother* if he let *your* parents know that they wouldn't be at Thanksgiving next year, instead of asking *her* if *she* told your parents the news? She's not being a little dramatic, she's the whole damn drama department. You had absolutely nothing to apologize for.

I'm trying to puzzle out why she took offense at OP's comment, and this is all I can come up with -- she wanted OP to express concern over her not coming and extrapolated that out into a melodrama.\n\nPerhaps she wanted OP to make it sound like if OP and his wife *and* the brother and his girlfriend weren't coming it would be two equally big blows to the parents, ruining their thanksgiving or something, as if thanksgiving would be saved if only she could come, so that one of the *equally valued* couples could be there, making things all right.\n\nETA: Rereading my first comment I see that it didn't express quite what I wanted it to, so I've made a couple of minor edits to refer more to OP's family.", "You challenged them on that explanation because it doesn't make any logical sense though, right? Like, you weren't asking them to check with your parents and you didn't say he HAD to inform them he was going to another Thanksgiving, you asked them if they let your parents know they wouldn't be attending Thanksgiving like they do every other year because it was a deviation to the norm and you didn't know if your parents were already aware. \n\nDo they both think they shouldn't have needed to tell your parents anything? They both expected your parents to make next year's Thanksgiving meal with the expectation they would be in attendance but then they just wouldn't show up?", "Oops, I meant fiancees. Bloody autocorrect.", "OP commented: \u201dThey told me that by asking if Ethan had checked with my parents it made Sally feel unimportant and as a \u201cburden\u201d that he has to inform our parents he was going to another thanksgiving.\u201d \n\nStupidest thing I ever read, imagine expecting your partner to not tell their parents that they wont be attending thanksgiving", "Lol. So many of these posts can be both.", "Hundred percent!"]}
