We\u2019re just not set up for this kind of usage, and it\u2019s costing us all money having to use our own data for our stuff. I\u2019m gonna need ($X, have an amount in mind) for the wifi and for the electricity you\u2019re using, it\u2019s not fair that we have to pay for you to game all day. And moving forward, we have to limit when you game, you can\u2019t do it during peak hours.\u201d\n\nAny resistance, change the wifi password.", "Big time NTA. Your friend is a guest in your and your roommates\u2019 home. Tell him about the issue with his gaming interfering your roommates\u2019 internet access. Don\u2019t let him shrug it off or talk crap about their concerns. \n\nIt might be a good time to ask your roommates when they primarily need the WiFi. Then tell your friend those hours are off limits. He\u2019s being an ungrateful guest and if he can\u2019t be more considerate, he can find another place to stay.", "How tf is he getting back on his feet if he games all day. IMO when someone gives you a place to stay it should be at no cost to them. Cover the cost of you existing there done be an AH", "Definitely NTA, and if 16+ hours a day of gaming is NOT getting back on their feet lol. And I here I thought I had something of a gaming addiction.\n\nHe either needs to tone it down or pitch in more for the electrical bill.", "NTA, soooooo sounds like the help you\u2019re giving them is going to turn into a full time roommate that doesn\u2019t pay situation.\n\n\nHe\u2019s gaming endlessly, he has no plans to leave, plan accordingly because you will have to throw him out at some point, so either way he\u2019s going to be pissed at you, might as well get it over with.", "Ask that person to pay their fair share even after they leave. Nothing comes for free. Rent alone doesn\u2019t help. People struggle to make their ends meet. So NTA. Don\u2019t ask to cut down the usage. Ask them to pay. And coming to not evening able to use the WiFi. Maybe tell that person that you guys, the actual residents of the house are thinking that to get a better plan for the house until this person is staying because of the problem you\u2019re facing and they have to pay as well.", "okay, there may be another solution here. go into your router admin/settings and limit the max data his devices can down and upload.\n\nhe wont be all that happy gaming anymore but... who cares?\n\nNTA", "Electricity usage aside, if they're gaming that much, how are they going to get back on their feet?

Your being kind and letting them stay with you, and their taking what appears to me to be blatant advantage of your kindness. WiFi and electricity cost money, of course it's not wrong to want them to stop driving your bills up.\nAlso how much do they game? Do they still do things like work? Do they pitch in to help out with the bills?

You are also totally within your right to ask them to pay xyz amount towards the bills even if the bill won't come until after they're expected to be gone. You are also totally within your right to ask for both. Their usage is interrupting you and the rest of your housemates usage, so a slow down discussion still needs to happen. If you don't you're causing conflict with your other housemates. \n\nIt seems like this person is not doing anything to get on their feet and is taking advantage of you. You need to make sure you have set a hard date with this person for when you expect them to be out by, otherwise you could be stuck with this person a lot longer than you bargained for. If you already have, you should kindly remind them when that date is and them laying around all day playing games is not what you signed up for.", "NTA, but you need to sit down with him and your roommates to discuss his usage.  The way it is now is unfair to your roommates.  He's your friend, so you are responsible for this situation.  (I would also discuss how long he's going to stay because if he's gaming all the time, it sounds like he doesn't have a job.)", "NTA, but you can fix the wifi usage if your router has QOS.  You can set up device priority and limit how much of your internet each device can use.  His games likely don't need the entire connection, but many games will take every bit they can get.  If QOS is set up then the game will just take the max amount that is allotted to him/everyone.", "How are they planning to \"get back on their feet\" by gaming so many hours that the device overheats?!? Is this gaming paying them money? Because if so, they should be paying the utilities bill. And if not, THEY NEED TO GET AN EFFING JOB!\n\nIs there actually an end date, or is this power and internet hog just a permanent fixture who claims to be \"getting back on their feet\"?\n\nAs to how to discuss the subject, ask your electric company for previous usage versus current and present an estimated amount for the game-mates share. In other words, either shine up your spine, or role over and give up.", "thankyou so much, i\u2019ll be using what you wrote when i have that chat.", "Thankyou for your advice. I\u2019ve been super stressed out about confronting the situation but just wanted other opinions.", "Thankyou, I\u2019ll be having a chat with him. Thought I was just being too harsh as he is going through some shit at the moment.", "When I had severe depression I was essentially gaming all day because the moment I stopped hell broke loose in my head. So I'm saying it's probably a coping mechanism. But if it was something affecting everyone else in the house it's reasonable to tone it down. Just because you're \"going through things\" doesn't mean you are justified to make other people's lives difficult, especially when they're doing a favor by letting you staying over.", "I\u2019m going to definitely have a chat and set something up. Thankyou heaps for your advice.", "i\u2019m gonna have that hard chat now with him.", "I unfortunately do not have control of the internet but I\u2019ll be asking my housemate to see if he can help when he\u2019s home. Thankyou for your advice", "I honestly don\u2019t know, he has been given work didn\u2019t show up afterwards because he was up all night gaming. I\u2019ve tried to ask about it and it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. There\u2019s a lot of blurred lines and questions that\u2019ve gone unanswered. It is temporary though and I\u2019ve made that clear.", "How did it go? What did you say or what did they say?", "how did it go?", "I was thinking that, but they are in a rough situation right now and I don\u2019t want to put them in a worse one financially.", "thankyou for your advice!", "he will play anywhere from 10am- 3pm (depending when he wakes up) until 3am-4am the next morning. he has been given job offers but shows up one day and doesn\u2019t go after that. he doesn\u2019t contribute to some rent but nothing around the house.", "And what exactly is he doing to get back on his feet if he's gaming all the time?", "Just log in to your router and lower the priority of the PlayStation. Their connection will be a little bit worse, but you can just play that off as the internet not working well. That should make the other devices operate better. Also, tell your friend to open up the PS and remove the dust. There\u2019s no reason to use an ice pack to cool a game console.", "If you can suck up the cost and he really is dealing with something truly traumatizing, I can understand that decision. However, if the man is gaming all day long, I\u2019m sorry, but unless your family was axe murdered or something you\u2019re getting your shit together.", "First off: NTA\n\nSecond: Too harsh? Frankly, you sound like you have the patience of a saint, I would have kicked him out... Going through some shit doesn't justify his behaviour. People going through hard times need professional help to get back, not gaming 24/7 (and yes I am a gamer myself).", "His shit does not justify having a big negative impact on others. It's completely possible to go thru a personal crisis while still being a decent human being.", "Stop being a doormat and kick him out . HOW is he a \u201cfriend\u201d? He has an addiction, some kind of psychological problem and you\u2019re not his therapist.", "OK, not showing up for work when he's trying \"to get back on his feet\" is Strike One. How many strikes are you going to give him? That's a damned big strike!\n\nWhat are the landlord tennant laws in your area? In many areas if he's been there for two months he's a tennant and you will need to evict him if he doesn't leave on his own.\n\nHogging the Wifi, racking up the electricity bill and gaming all day sound like Strikes Two, Three and Four to me.", "i started off with the reiterating the fact that he is only here for a certain period of time and it was to help him get back on his feet. i asked whether this job he said he had lined up was a sure thing and he said yes. in early January, he\u2019ll be off. i spoke to him about how much time he is spending on his game and how much it is causing disruptions in everyone else\u2019s lives who live here- from us not being able to connect to the internet because he is chewing the wifi up to him being up til 4am every morning when i have two other housemates with very difficult jobs also as they work in the hospital and with children so we all need our rest. \nhe did get cranky and i stood my ground when he tried speaking over me but ultimately the message is clear. let\u2019s hope it\u2019s smooth sailing here on out. again, thankyou all for your help.", "he also did say he\u2019d send some money for the next bill when we get it, but we\u2019ll see", "And this is the question at hand\u2026\u261d\ufe0f", "unfortunately i don\u2019t have it in me to do that to him because i\u2019ve been in the same kinda shoes before when i was 15, homeless with nowhere to go. except i didn\u2019t always have that help. i\u2019m just giving the benefit of the doubt here. i\u2019ve had a chat now to him (my little update is below somewhere in the comments)", "i do appreciate what you\u2019ve said though and i won\u2019t let him walk over me.", "Hmm, getting cranky at the people helping him isn't a promising sign. Maybe he'll reluctantly stick to the deal but if he doesn't I'd be ready to nip it in the bud.", "Early January? Did you expect him to stay that long? Also, were your housemates included in the decision to have him stay in the first place?  And are they all on board with him staying that long?", "For the internet you could limit his internet bandwith so he uses just enough that the rest can comfortably use it as well. For the elctricity bill, quick google search says ps5 uses between 160-200 W, google also says that the price of a KWh in US is around 9-10 cents. So based on your story, lets say he was gaming 15 hours a day everyday, the ps5 would consume between 2.4 - 3 dollars a day, assuming he was playing 15 hours a day and a KWh is 10cents."]}
