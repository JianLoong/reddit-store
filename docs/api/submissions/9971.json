I've started looking for jobs and I've been thinking that I could try being a particular nurse (those that you hire to take care of a patient in their own home or if they need medical care 24/7). I would prefer that for now as I got very anxious during my practices in hospitals, there's many patients and it's a very stressful situation if you don't have much experience. My idea is to work as a domestic nurse for 1/2 years and then try again to work in a clinic or hospital after I got some experience. \n\nWell I have a brother who's 14 years old, he has autism and it's disabled from his waist down. My parents asked me if I would be willing to work for them taking care of my brother I said it's okay for me, a patient is a patient, then they asked how much was the \"family discount\" in order to consider hiring me. I told them they'll have to pay full price if they want me to nurse my brother, there's no such thing as a family discount. \n\nThey got pissed, they told me I'm doing this for them and for my brother and that there's stuff more important than money. I don't think that what I am asking is unreasonable, after all I have to take my brother to therapy, shower him, clean him up, feed him, give him his medication, etc. All the same stuff I would have to do with any other patient, I think I am asking for a fair pay that's consistent with how much work I am gonna do.

You might think of doing this through a care company. Secondly, when you get ready to go back into a hospital or clinical situation, you're going to need a valid reference.

And to be honest, i think 25\u00a3/h is way too low for this kind of care you want to provide. This would be the family discount...\nAnd as a bit of advice: never work for family or close friends.

This is something people who don't want to pay up say. NTA", "NTA. Your parents are just tired of taking care of your brother and want you to start doing it so that it\u2019s not their responsibility anymore.

I would worry working without this leaves you vulnerable to gaps in your clinical competence.", "Info: do your parents intend on giving you a benefits package?

How do they expect you to survive on whatever pittance they want to pay?", "NAH i can understand where your parents are coming from. Being an autistic person myself who needs a carer its much nicer to have it be family, but the reality is that a carer costs so much money and unfortunately when a family member takes on that task (depending where you live in the world) the pay is not great. Obviously a family discount would be appropriate if they offer you other things as incentives but you're not ta for asking for your full rate as it's a difficult economy.\n\nIf the situation doesnt work for both parties then it doesn't work.", "Nta.\n\nQuestion what is their long-term plan for him for when they pass? Or do they just expect you to do it? I be telling them they need to start setting up a fun to deal with his medical expenses and living expenses now. I'd also be telling them my work is not free.

Have you asked your parents if they have a timeline for the arrangement, especially since they are essentially asking you to stunt your career in terms of skills, growth and earnings? \n\nOP, please carefully consider the start of your career path. Home health workers, sadly, are terribly underpaid in the long run and it might not be as simple as transitioning to a new care setting in two years. Try and talk to an experienced nurse to get some advice. There are other care settings that aren\u2019t high-pressure hospital work, but that have growth and earning potential.", " NTA. You shouldn't be expected to work for less as you have needs, bills, etc as well. My only question is did your family help you out with college bills, loving expenses? I ask this because it does change the equation a bit where depending on the level of extra support given to you. You would still be in your right to not give a discount but there's a moral implication.", "NTA how do they expect you to live if they aren't paying you properly?

Just because you're going to become a nurse and you happen to be his sibling doesn't mean your parents should expect you to be willing and able to look after your brother at a discounted rate - that's absurd. As his parents, do they seriously not realise the sheer amount of time and resources that would go towards the care of your brother? If so, they shouldn't expect you to take on such a demanding job for a slave wage.\n\nNgl, I bet they expected you to decline any payment from them and take care of him for free because faaaaaaamily.\n\nI live in the UK and I suspect you do too. Again, \u00a325 per hour honestly sounds like a discount in itself in this country considering the job and how expensive everything's become. If I were your parents, I'd be grateful.", "NTA\n\nBut don't work for family.  If you do, there will inevitably be a point where there's resentment on one or both sides.  For instance, if your parents are consistently late coming home, you'll resent them.  If you want to be paid for extra hours worked, they may resent you.\n\nKeep family and business separate.", "NTA. It would be a terrible idea to do what your parents want no matter how much they paid you. Working for family is likely to turn into a total nightmare. What happens if your parents are short on cash and can\u2019t pay you? Get a job doing home healthcare or working in an assisted living facility.", "NTA. Look for another job.", "Rupees. But usually easier to find them in grass and pots.", "I don't have experience and I've been advised to change a little lower for my first years, but yes it's cheap already. Thank you for your advice! I've heard that mixing family and business was not a good idea lol", "When I had trouble affording salon care when my kids were younger I would pull out scissors and clippers to handle it myself.

I don't know the laws in your country so maybe this is bullshit). \nThen you get a better feeling for how much you can charge\n\nGood luck on you way!", "That's something. Tell them you are not comfortable working with someone close in the family. It could \"cloud your judgement\". And find another paying patient. You have to take care of yourself now.", "In that case I have no useful advice to offer other than it's a complicated situation lol I'd still say NTA, because it's of physical and emotional stress and OP deserves compensation and benefits. But I understand having family involved can change the dynamic and make it far more complicated. \n\nHowever, OP, from experience, I would recommend *not* being employed by family outside of official business with a company and contracts. I'm a mom of disabled children and my in-laws hired me to clean and help around the house of my disabled MIL. It became a problem quickly as I was not being paid on time and was often expected to be the caretaker during normal visits and outings (While also caring for my physically disabled children). I eventually had to end the agreement because it was destroying our relationship with my husband's family and causing a lot of resentment on both sides when I tried to set boundaries."]}
