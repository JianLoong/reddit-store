Just because you're going to become a nurse and you happen to be his sibling doesn't mean your parents should expect you to be willing and able to look after your brother at a discounted rate - that's absurd. As his parents, do they seriously not realise the sheer amount of time and resources that would go towards the care of your brother?

It would be a terrible idea to do what your parents want no matter how much they paid you. Working for family is likely to turn into a total nightmare.

But I understand having family involved can change the dynamic and make it far more complicated. \n\nHowever, OP, from experience, I would recommend *not* being employed by family outside of official business with a company and contracts. I'm a mom of disabled children and my in-laws hired me to clean and help around the house of my disabled MIL.

You\u2019re going to destroy your nursing career if you take this easy option because of your anxiety. You need to stay working in hospitals for a good few years to get experience with the supervision of experienced nurses and doctors.

I would only pay for you as a carer. \n\nMaybe look for a calmer clinical setting to get you started????", "NTA... but you will run into problems having your brother as primary client.

Either a relative is acting as caregiver or a professional is hired, not some weird in-between combination.", "As someone in health care, it not only is a major conflict of interest caring for your own family in a professional capacity but it will make it incredibly hard to move on from this job.

Besides that they don\u2019t want to pay you a fair wage what will happen when you are ready to move on and get another job? Or when they make requests they wouldn\u2019t of another in home nurse?

Nursing school was incredibly stressful and I felt like I would never be prepared to work in a hospital. When you actually start working, it\u2019s a lot different. As a new grad you\u2019ll work under a preceptor and most likely go into a program with other new grads. You\u2019re not immediately thrown to the wolves. You\u2019ll also get much more confident in your abilities over time. My recommendation is to try to find a new grad program and then spend a year or two working on the floor. You can decide after that if you want to leave bedside and go into another field of nursing that\u2019s not as demanding or stressful.
