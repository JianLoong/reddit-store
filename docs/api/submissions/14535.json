I understand this is a cultural thing, and so while I find this extremely uncomfortable, I can respect that turning her down may have been an insult. That said, you could say that you prefer your SIL not to feed her because then your daughter wouldn't be hungry enough to relive you of engorgement that built up while you were away from her. That you don't want to have to waste time pumping to keep your supply consistent. That way, you can avoid hurting her feelings.", "NTA at all.  I would be enraged", "NTA.

With that being said, I don't really see the issue as long as the other woman is healthy and disease free. People will willingly feed their kids milk taken from animals, but milk from another lactating human mother is somehow gross and weird? Okay then.", "NTA. You are not overreacting.

So for health reasons, I wouldn\u2019t allow it either", "Used to be very common in Europe and 'the West' too, but not so much these last few generations. Upperclass babies would be nursed by someone hired for the job (or an enslaved woman, where there was slavery). Regular babies were often nursed by a relative or neighbour, if the mother was unable or unavailable. \n\nBut, cultures are not static. Sometimes they change for good reasons, too.", "It clearly isn't for the dad's family though.  I don't know but I really wouldn't be surprised if that is even more the historical norm, the idea that only mom should breastfeed the baby would fit in with the general western trend towards a more individualistic lifestyle.\n\nJust a quick wikipedia search did turn up this seemingly apt paragraph:\n\n>It is not only the mother who may breastfeed her child. She may hire another woman to do so (a wet nurse), or she may share childcare with another mother (cross-nursing). Both of these were common throughout history. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. Shared breastfeeding is a risk factor for HIV infection in infants.\\[162\\] Shared nursing can sometimes provoke negative social reactions in the English-speaking world.\\[163\\]\\[164\\]", "Not only just that, everyone\u2019s breast milk is also formulated to their child\u2019s needs."]}
