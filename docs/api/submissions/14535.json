She may hire another woman to do so (a wet nurse), or she may share childcare with another mother (cross-nursing). Both of these were common throughout history. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child.

But in modern day Western society it's unusual.\n\nNothing wrong with not wanting SIL to do that. You should thank her, as it sounds like a good faith offer to help, especially if their culture does still do it.  You might want to explain that your culture prefers for the mother to do that themselves as a bonding technique.  I wouldn't mention health risks, cause there's a chance she'll take that as you saying she's probably sick, and I doubt you think that", "What is the opposite of ESH?

It sounds like you both want the best for your baby and believe your own cultural norm is the healthiest thing. That's okay, and you'll work through it.\n\nIf the two of you are from different cultures with different ideas about childrearing, it would be a good idea to sit down and talk about them now before any more of these issues come up.

I did this with a friend - our kiddos were nine days apart, and we were both on mat leave. If one of us has stuff to do, we'd drop kiddo at the other's house for a few hours. Both kids were all but exclusively breastfed, and it was significantly easier to nurse both rather than try to nurse one and bottle feed the other. \n\nBut that was us, agreed on in advance, and we both had clean blood work (and so did our spouses - she and I had ours done when pregnant, our spouses had everything checked when we started talking about it, just to be extra careful).\n\nOut of the blue? Not a chance, outside an emergency. I did sort of nurse a different friend's kid once - friend and her husband left kid with me, left bottles, and were T-boned while they were out. We had their kid for six days while they were in the hospital and recovering (serious concussion + five month old is not a good mix), and I wasn't sure what formula they used - bottles were pre-measured. On the advice of my pediatrician, I pumped, and their kid got my milk in the usual bottle for a couple of feeds, on the basis that switching formula can be tough on baby tummies.

I completely concur with the NTA verdict.", "Totally agree with that. OP is definitely NTA.", "May I vandalize your car = may my sister breastfeed our baby?", "It\u2019s not rubbish. When your baby gets sick the milk changes. Depending on the age of the baby the composition of the milk changes too.\n\n\u201cFirst, a study from 2012 found that when a baby has an active infection, the white blood cell content (macrophages) of their parent\u2019s breast milk increases, as do other protective factors. This supports the idea that the immune defense provided by your nursing sick infants is active and responsive.\n\nNext, a study in 2013 looked at what happened to the baseline amounts of leukocytes (a type of white blood cells) in breast milk during times of illness for the nursing parent or their nursed baby. The researchers found that leukocytes increased \u201csignificantly\u201d when either the nursing parent or their baby was ill.\n\nOnce the illness passed, the level of leukocytes returned to normal baseline levels, suggesting a relationship between illness and leukocyte levels in breast milk. The study researchers concluded that there\u2019s likely a strong association between the health of the nursing parent and infant and leukocyte levels of their breast milk.\u201d\n\nAs an example. https://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/does-breast-milk-change-when-baby-is-sick#when-baby-is-sick", "Humans have wet-nursed for millennia.\n\nI think OP is quite within her rights to prevent it. If it was my child I wouldn't want it either. But it's hard to imagine it's intrinsically harmful.\n\nEven the paper cited shows more that the mother's milk may be extra beneficial as opposed to another's milk being harmful. There are plenty of babies who never get to drink human milk at all.", "I\u2019m not stating wet nursing is harmful at all lol, I\u2019m replying to a commenter stating it\u2019s bullshit that milk composition changes.\n\nFed babies are the best babies overall.", "Ah. I see.\n\nThe \"baby's milk is formulated for their needs\" was first said in the context of reasons why wet nursing is bad.\n\nSo it's not crazy to have believed you were backing that proposition. Thank you for the clarification."]}
