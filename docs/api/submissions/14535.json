He then turned to his sister and said 'oh she said you can't' while I was still on the phone. \n\nApparently it's normal in their culture and I said that's fine but for mine it's not so it's a no. I had to go over there which then ended up being awkward because they both just assumed and decided between themselves that she could breastfeed my baby and then acted like I was being a bitch for not letting her.

And no I don't know anything about my SIL's health history but this was not the reason why I said no. I just wasn't comfortable with the idea because it is not a norm for me but mainly because I consider it bonding time with my daughter.\n\nMy partner and I talked about it when we got home and he said he understood where I was coming from and that he was sorry he did not ask me first, they just thought since it was normal for them that it would be okay. Which is completely fine. I told him it was the fact that he didn't ask me first which put me in an awkward situation that could have been avoided which was made worse by them saying she was hungry and have me feed her when I know when my child is hungry because of how she behaves and fusses. She was not hungry at all but tired and just wanted cuddles.", "created_utc": 1681219631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ijw4q/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_in_law/", "score": 1781, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may hire another woman to do so (a wet nurse), or she may share childcare with another mother (cross-nursing). Both of these were common throughout history.

You should thank her, as it sounds like a good faith offer to help, especially if their culture does still do it.

Both kids were all but exclusively breastfed, and it was significantly easier to nurse both rather than try to nurse one and bottle feed the other. \n\nBut that was us, agreed on in advance, and we both had clean blood work (and so did our spouses - she and I had ours done when pregnant, our spouses had everything checked when we started talking about it, just to be extra careful).\n\nOut of the blue? Not a chance, outside an emergency. I did sort of nurse a different friend's kid once - friend and her husband left kid with me, left bottles, and were T-boned while they were out. We had their kid for six days while they were in the hospital and recovering (serious concussion + five month old is not a good mix), and I wasn't sure what formula they used - bottles were pre-measured. On the advice of my pediatrician, I pumped, and their kid got my milk in the usual bottle for a couple of feeds, on the basis that switching formula can be tough on baby tummies.

This supports the idea that the immune defense provided by your nursing sick infants is active and responsive.\n\nNext, a study in 2013 looked at what happened to the baseline amounts of leukocytes (a type of white blood cells) in breast milk during times of illness for the nursing parent or their nursed baby. The researchers found that leukocytes increased \u201csignificantly\u201d when either the nursing parent or their baby was ill.\n\nOnce the illness passed, the level of leukocytes returned to normal baseline levels, suggesting a relationship between illness and leukocyte levels in breast milk. The study researchers concluded that there\u2019s likely a strong association between the health of the nursing parent and infant and leukocyte levels of their breast milk.\u201d\n\nAs an example. https://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/does-breast-milk-change-when-baby-is-sick#when-baby-is-sick", "Humans have wet-nursed for millennia.\n\nI think OP is quite within her rights to prevent it.

It is, which is why mother's milk (pumped if baby is in the NICU) is the top choice. Donor milk is a second choice since fragile neonates can digest it much more easily than even preemie formula.

My oldest baby was allergic to it and had blood in her stool. They thought she might have a bowel infection and kept her in the hospital for an extra two weeks. They put a picc line into her jugular. Once we realized (after she came home) that formula was the issue, I would have killed for some donated breastmilk to feed to her. I was deeply grateful to avoid a similar fiasco with her siblings by just keeping them on breastmilk until their colons matured a little. \n\nEveryone can make their own decisions, and this one should have been made by OP and her husband together, which he obviously didn\u2019t do. Don\u2019t feed your baby donor milk if you don\u2019t want to. But there is nothing wrong with others making a different choice.", "Same here. It\u2019s an extremely personal decision, and thankfully it sounds like they respected her choice. I think the OP was probably just shocked because it\u2019s not widely used or spoken about in some cultures. \n\n\nI had a friend nurse my baby a few times and I nursed another friend\u2019s baby. I felt very comfortable because I knew them so well- I knew what vitamins/meds they take, I knew their overall health, and I probably knew what they ate for lunch. It sounds strange at first, but I was a 25 year old mother in Seattle and within a few of my circles this was done. \n\nThe first time my friend fed my baby was when she was babysitting and ran out of milk and my baby was still hungry. We got stuck in a traffic accident and it took us over an hour to get back, and we had previously discussed this and I gave her permission, she nursed her to sleep that night. My kid had a special bond with that friend outside of that experience too, so it all seemed very natural. \n\nFirst time I nursed a friends kid was when my friend\u2019s older kid had an asthma attack and completely stopped breathing when we were at the skate park. She went in the ambulance and I stayed with her baby. They were in the hospital for hours, baby had never taken a bottle before, it was a no brainer for us. \n\n\n\nAnyway I didn\u2019t write this to say the OP was wrong and I\u2019m trying to change her mind, because she was absolutely in her right to not want that. But I wanted to share for others to see that it\u2019s actually kind of pretty normal in some circles.", "yes it should, they're the one who are breastfeeding", "People just want to feel righteous. It\u2019s his baby too, and he did concede to her decision without throwing a fit AND they had a convo later about it and found out where they went sideways.

People are allowed to opt out. Your entire argument is predicated on the sister having definitely tested, known if she was HIV positive and taking treatment. \n\nI work in healthcare. Peopke are allowed to opt out of HIV testing. They usually don't, but it's not 100 percent. Even  if you've literally had a needle stick injury and need to test them to make sure they havent transmitted an illness to you, they are allowed to decline. \n\nJust because someone has had a baby doesnt guarantee that anyone knows their HIV status. \n\nYou're right, it's not relevant in this case.

But, my perspective is this: the people you get breastmilk from are also moms using the same milk to feed their babies. They aren\u2019t going to knowingly pass disease to their baby. I have one friend who is on a medication that isn\u2019t safe for breastfeeding: she didn\u2019t breastfeed her babies. She didn\u2019t have milk to donate: she let it dry up because it would have harmed her own kids just as much as someone else\u2019s. \n\nIf I know someone well and know their parenting style and have had conversations about them about how they handled their prenatal care and how they\u2019re making sure everyone who meets little Johnny has had a TDAP recently, it gives me a pretty good idea of what they\u2019re putting into their milk. Also, women are usually very open about what medications, etc they are on when donating. If you aren\u2019t getting paid for it, there\u2019s not really any incentive to lie. \u201cHa!

There are lots of babies who don\u2019t tolerate formula, and it\u2019s pretty common for people to get breastmilk from overproducing moms when that happens.

I'd wake up so engorged I'd feed her from one side and pump 9oz from the other side just to get a bit of relief. My friend's baby was on formula as he'd never managed to nurse so once my freezer was full I offered my excess to her. She was so thrilled to have it and I was able to give him 4-10oz a day for about 7 months.\n\nWhen we had our next babies, a few months apart, she really wanted to breastfeed but her baby had a severe tongue tie. Because of complications with her csection it was nearly 3 weeks before she could get him to the feeding clinic to get it clipped. Her poor nipples were shredded. She was in absolute agony latching him. So I would go over every evening and do the cluster feeds with both of our sons so she could rest long enough to pump a bottle for her baby's midnight feed. That way she got a decent 6-8 hour break every day to heal a bit. His latch wasn't great but I had lots of milk and could cope with those few hours without getting injured by his shallow latch.\n\nOnce his tongue tie was snipped he was much better and she healed up. But after that we just found it convenient \ud83d\ude02 like one of us would make lunch and the other would feed the babies. I have a lovely pic of me feeding both boys as toddlers. Truly magical times and both of us feel the three boys we shared feeding are \"our\" babies whether we gave birth to them or not.\n\nI understand why women have reservations about it in Western culture, and I'd never try to convince someone who wasn't comfortable to do it, but it was honestly an incredible experience for me.

Just Nestle trying to sell more formula.\n\nIf you look at murals and artwork from 100 years ago, you will see breastfeeding depicted.  In artwork trying to show someone speaking about something virtuous or meant to appeal to family values, you will see women with suckling babies among the listening crowd.

They discussed it in the post but like if OP\u2019s baby daddy didn\u2019t agree to not let his kin nurse I\u2019d not necessarily say she has all the say in this decision.", "Just because something was common a hundred years ago doesn\u2019t make it not weird in modern times. In fact really the opposite? And idk where people get this idea \u201cthey did this in all of history and everyone was just fine\u201d. They in fact were not fine, infant mortality rates were significantly higher. They didn\u2019t used to name babies until they were toddlers because they died so often. If I told people I wasn\u2019t giving my child a name until they were 3, by your definition anyone who considered that is it objectively incorrect because it used to be common.", "NTA! That is super creepy and I would be telling my partner that it\u2019s a huge dealbreaker. I think it\u2019s disgusting. \n\nAfter that, I would never trust that person again and make sure my baby stayed with me 24/7.\n\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d in their culture. That\u2019s no excuse. Ick, yuck, what were they thinking?", "I always thought that was a little creepy myself.  The bottom line?  It's your baby your rules...  NTAH.", "NTA", "Keep your baby away from this woman.  She\u2019ll just feed your kid & lie to your face about it.  Those type of women do whatever they want.", "NAH.  To be honest, it sounds like you both reacted defensively because you were both surprised.  As long as he respects your decision moving forward, it doesn't sound like it needs to be a federal issue.", "Hell no you are NTA. Not only is it weird to even think you have the right to breastfeed someone else\u2019s baby without asking them is just absurd but also who knows what diseases your SIL has? Yuck.", "I donated breastmilk to like 20 babies during the years I was breastfeeding my own kids, which is in the same realm of this issues... BUT donated milk is awesome but another person breastfeeding your baby is soooo not cool. It's very different things.  There is a level of intimacy to breastfeeding that using donated milk doesn't have.\n\nHeck, my kids dad and I were extreme about ensuring the kids got breastmilk and I breastfed each kid for 3 years. We also knew that if something happened to me his cousin would donate to our babies... she wouldn't have directly fed though!!!\n\nNTA, but been around the breastfeeding world and around enough hippies that do that where I know it's acceptable to skme. It never would be to me though.", "NTA. And ew. How is letting someone else put their boob in your child\u2019s mouth okay? \n\nI don\u2019t care if wet nurses were a thing. This is weird. If you\u2019re able to breastfeed, and you want to, then nobody else should be feeding your baby but you. Can\u2019t believe your husband thought that would be okay. WTF.", "Nowadays that\u2019s weird as hell. I was barely comfortable letting someone else prepare a bottle for my son when he was still really little.", "YTA. I breastfed my niece because another SIL and I were taking care of multiple children. The niece was one month older than my oldest son and could smell the milk on me and would not take a bottle.\n          \nAs far as I know, my niece does not remember the event.", "NTA it may be okay and normal for them but it's not for you and that's okay. They need to respect your choices and life style.", "Donated milk is screened and pasteurized. That's the biggest difference in this situation. Well that and OP said no, as is her right.", "It's a good enough reason for most people not to use a used needle.", "I literally say a gazillion times OP was within her right to say no. Keep up.", "How did your mental gymnastics get to that conclusion?", "Or they also can acquire a better immune system short term, due to the baby getting antibodies that the mother may not have, and long term since gut flora is strengthened by breastfeeding and studies indicate that the breastfeeding mom's gut flora has a lot of influence on the child's lifelong gut flora composition. I understand not wanting another woman to feed your child, but I'd you're going to make an argument for health, considering the SIL must have been recently pregnant and quite likely in a first world country it seems much more likely that she will pass extra immunity to the baby than hiv or hep.", "There are things called asymptomatic infections where the person is contagious but *doesn't actually have symptoms.*  HIV has an asymptomatic stage, that is why you always hear about people being told they need to notify previous sexual partners when they are diagnosed, I bet if it is a woman who is breast-feeding, they're told they need to notify whomever they've donated/shared their breastmilk with.", ">OP\u2019s husband respected her decision.\n\nUm\n\n  \n>He then turned to his sister and said 'oh she said you can't' while I was still on the phone. \n\n\nSounds like OP getting thrown under the bus.\n\n  \nI see in the edit that he admits he should have asked beforehand (which is good) but don't wait until the moment arrives to have this discussion.\n\n\n\n>When you have a child you don\u2019t get to make unilateral decisions.\n  \n  \n\nOP is the one making the food for this baby (which is made for baby's age, immune system, and what vitamins they need most) she gets the biggest say on what baby ingests. Partner heard the baby cry and thought \"must be hungry\". Babies have varying cries, which OP recognized. Maybe partner should brush up on the [variations](https://youtu.be/IYz6tE3XmHM) in sounds. Because NEH is hungry and AH/OWH is tired. They're **very** different.", "It's easy for things to slip peoples minds in conversation.  Doesn't make them assholes or give any good reason to be enraged.  When she said no they respected her wishes.  Wrongly thinking someone is ok with something that is normal in your culture is an accident.", "It's not an unreasonable question.  It's normal in some cultures, including theirs.", "Yeah, both of mine were (and still are) string beans. I was kind of sad I never got baby rolls.", "There are people out there with *asymptomatic* HIV who don't know they are positive yet but can still pass it on to others.", "The person you're replying to was talking about some comment upthread that seems to imply that wet nursing or donating milk makes no sense since formula exists, not to OP's particular situation. They will be downvoted and so will I, because it's a sensitive subject, but they are right. Breast milk from a healthy person is objectively better than formula.", "And since the other person likely got medical care do you think they\u2019d not have detected it during the whole pregnancy process? Stop hyping everything to Mach 11. It\u2019s so tiresome and needless."]}
