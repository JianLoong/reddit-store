You should thank her, as it sounds like a good faith offer to help, especially if their culture does still do it.

That's okay, and you'll work through it.\n\nIf the two of you are from different cultures with different ideas about childrearing, it would be a good idea to sit down and talk about them now before any more of these issues come up.

I did this with a friend - our kiddos were nine days apart, and we were both on mat leave. If one of us has stuff to do, we'd drop kiddo at the other's house for a few hours. Both kids were all but exclusively breastfed, and it was significantly easier to nurse both rather than try to nurse one and bottle feed the other. \n\nBut that was us, agreed on in advance, and we both had clean blood work (and so did our spouses - she and I had ours done when pregnant, our spouses had everything checked when we started talking about it, just to be extra careful).\n\nOut of the blue? Not a chance, outside an emergency. I did sort of nurse a different friend's kid once - friend and her husband left kid with me, left bottles, and were T-boned while they were out. We had their kid for six days while they were in the hospital and recovering (serious concussion + five month old is not a good mix), and I wasn't sure what formula they used - bottles were pre-measured. On the advice of my pediatrician, I pumped, and their kid got my milk in the usual bottle for a couple of feeds, on the basis that switching formula can be tough on baby tummies.

When your baby gets sick the milk changes.

This supports the idea that the immune defense provided by your nursing sick infants is active and responsive.\n\nNext, a study in 2013 looked at what happened to the baseline amounts of leukocytes (a type of white blood cells) in breast milk during times of illness for the nursing parent or their nursed baby. The researchers found that leukocytes increased \u201csignificantly\u201d when either the nursing parent or their baby was ill.\n\nOnce the illness passed, the level of leukocytes returned to normal baseline levels, suggesting a relationship between illness and leukocyte levels in breast milk. The study researchers concluded that there\u2019s likely a strong association between the health of the nursing parent and infant and leukocyte levels of their breast milk.\u201d\n\nAs an example. https://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/does-breast-milk-change-when-baby-is-sick#when-baby-is-sick", "Humans have wet-nursed for millennia.\n\nI think OP is quite within her rights to prevent it.

And on top of all that, ONLY milk pumped before my baby was 18 months old is eligible for donation.\n\nSo yeah, actually, the safety protocols around breastmilk donation are rather more extensive than \"bruh just let me breastfeed your baby.\"\n\nETA: I see now that you were responding to the comment that breastmilk is personalized to your baby's needs. It is, which is why mother's milk (pumped if baby is in the NICU) is the top choice. Donor milk is a second choice since fragile neonates can digest it much more easily than even preemie formula. While mother's milk is ideal, donor milk is usually an adequate substitute that minimizes the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, which is a small but significant risk for formula-fed preemies.", "They pasteurize it before giving to other children", "Because it doesn't mean no other babies can drink it. Breastmilk adapts to the baby's needs, but it's not like it becomes poison for other babies.", "She's not her SIL's doctor. People can look perfectly healthy yet have diseases running rampant in their body.", "You can't physically see if someone is HIV positive. \n\nEven if SIL is perfectly healthy on all accounts, OP said no because it's HER bonding time with baby. That's perfectly valid on it's own imo\n\nNTA", ">OP knows whether their SIL has hepatitis or HIV.\n\nThere are a lot of people who have no clue about their *own* hepatitis or HIV status!

She is not her SIL's doctor and doesn't know her medical history. The chances of her having these illnesses are  slight but a chance still exists.", "I was just letting her know that babies get ill from breast milk. The only illness i know that can be transmitted and can\u2019t be cured is HIV which can be passed through milk.

Formula is preferable to starvation but it is ridiculous to act like it is superior to wet nursing.", "No doubt, but wet nursing comes with the knowledge and consent of the mother, who likely trusts the health of the person and wants to participate in that community feeding method. Not a random handoff because somebody's titties are producing without their input.", "I think I'd push back on the 'that's that' sentiment.  I feel like most discussions about this kind of thing turn on bodily autonomy, and that means that it's wholly the mother's decision.  But that's been removed here, it's just about what their child is being fed so it should actually be a joint decision.\n\n(I'm of course not saying she must do what he wants, that she's wrong for not being comfortable with it, but I think this scenario much closer to a disagreement over what brand of formula to buy than it is 'my body my choice')", "Of course Dad's have rights. But breastfeeding is usually a very personal thing for mothers and many if not most consider it to be just as much about bonding with their child as it is giving the child nutrients. Let's say you had a very specific bonding activity you did with your kid and everyone knows that you are the only one and have always been the only one to do this activity with them. Let's say it's a specific song you sing to them that you made up and that talks about your love for your child. Wouldn't you feel weird and a little violated that someone else just started singing that very specific song to them, *your song*, without asking you first?", "But he didn't ask. He told her in an off-handed way that it would be happening. And only then did he realize that his wife was not okay with it. Which doesn't necessarily make him an AH, especially if it's very normal in his culture. But, you'd think, depending on what culture they live in, that maybe this was something that should have been obvious is not a universally done practice and should have been asked about beforehand.", "Exactly. Enraged is way too much here.", "Where do I say that? My point was they're both unreasonable questions, and you're definitely allowed to be pissed about even being asked them.", "No, the woman breastfeeding someone else's baby is worse", "Well, you're wrong.

So what happens if baby is hungry and screaming but mom isn't around? Why is she not pumping and providing bottles for dad when she isn't there?

I\u2019m not saying that the sister has it but, I would avoid it just because of that being a risk.", "It's also massively pasteurised and as the parent of the neonate you have to sign a consent form saying you understand any risks (in the UK at least)\n\nEdit to add - it's not just the milk that's screened, any donor has to have blood tests done to screen for potential infection risks. Again, this is in the UK. \n\nSource: have both donated and signed that consent form, and seen the milk pasteuriser in action \ud83d\ude00", "The comment I was responding to said \"Not only just that, everyone\u2019s breast milk is also formulated to their child\u2019s needs.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean that it doesn't get screened.

That kind of thinking is a recipe for never leaving the house again. Do you not go out to restaurants because your servers might have ebola?\n\nApparently OP is okay with the SIL being around the baby, just not breastfeeding. I can't fathom why anyone would think there's a possibility of health outcome differences there.\n\nWhy is this any more risky than plane travel, or going to the store, or eating chicken? Each of those things also carries a \"you never know\" risk. Do you believe there's a higher chance of the SIL unknowingly having a serious disease than any of those things?", "That's what I said initially.\n\n>Im persuaded by the idea that it's a personal decision because of a relationship between a baby and mother, but the health stuff is nonsense.", "If people don't always know their own HIV or Hepatitis status then why does OP feel comfortable breastfeeding their own baby?\n\nObviously, because that would be ridiculous. But I'm not sure why it's super obvious OP couldn't unknowingly have hepatitis, but it's viable to worry about the SIL having it.\n\nDo you think it's wrong for women to use formula because it's possible they get a bad batch that cools hurt their child?\n\nOP surely will go on planes, go out in crowds, or drive a car. All of these have inherent risks much higher than the odds of the SIL transmitting a disease through their breastmilk.\n\nI truly don't get the \"you never know\" argument. We don't know anything 100%, but if the risk is low enough we ignore it because we have to live our lives.", "But this isn't a choice between formula or breastmilk, this mother does seem to nurse her baby.", "The dad's sister is \"a random handoff?\"", "Not necessarily. Odds are they don't sit around talking about breastfeeding and how their culture does it. If that's how they've always been odds are he didn't think anything of it. If anything mom should have brought it up like hey I understand this is how your family has always done it but it's not how I want to do it. Dad respected the wishes anyway so I don't even understand the problem. Either way I'm done with this discussion. I'm ok with people having different opinions than me.
