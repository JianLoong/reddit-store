I constantly told her not to do it and how it would be selfish of her to do so when we have bills to pay. But she ignored what I said and stopped going to both anyways. Meanwhile I am a blue collar worker and have been working nonstop 12 hour shifts 5 days a week to put a roof over our head. I rightfully got a bit upset at her when I found this news out but ultimately decided I\u2019d try to work this out with her. I told her if she was going to stay home without a job or going to college that she must take care of the household chores while I\u2019m gone and put in job applications. \n\nShe had agreed with me after a bit of talking and after the first few days it was going decent. She would cook meals for me, take care of the house, and she had even put in a few job applications to some local retail stores. But after about a week of this she got lazy, I\u2019d come home and see  dirty laundry, piles of dishes, she began to cook only for herself, and on top of all this, she still had not found a job. I confronted her about this and she began telling me the same story that she\u2019s depressed which made me a bit annoyed with her. I told her that I am depressed too but I still clock into work 12 hours a day, 5 days of the week. I said to her that the least she can do is some housework and that regardless if she is sad or not she\u2019s an adult and needs to act like one. So she agreed to what I had said and she started taking care of things again. It wasn\u2019t long until she went back to her ways and one day I came home to see her still asleep at 4PM and the house was a mess, no laundry was done, clothes were scattered on our floor, no dishes done, our plants weren\u2019t watered, nothing was made for dinner, and she had water bottles and food everywhere. I woke her up and told her that if she\u2019s going to disrespect me like this while I provide for her that she needs to leave. \n\nShe started begging me to let her stay and I felt a bit sad but I ultimately stood by my words. I felt bad about kicking her out on her own, so I called up her parents whom I have a pretty good relationship with and told them the situation. I worked out a deal with them and they agreed to have my girlfriend move back into their house, I told my girlfriend that if she wanted to get back together she\u2019s going to need to do the right thing and get a job. I helped her move her things into her parents place and said my goodbyes to her. Fast forward nearly a month later and I hear from her parents that she is still unemployed. I felt a bit sad hearing that, but she\u2019s an adult and at the end of the day she needs to fulfill her role. I\u2019m just one person and I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I can\u2019t provide for two.", "created_utc": 1695144704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mx4jj/aita_for_kicking_out_my_girlfriend_because_she/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not fair of her to burden you with her mental health issues when you guys are young, still establishing yourselves and living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nPlus, she had a safe place to go. It is her parents' job to house her and help her - she's their kid still even at 19. It's not your job and you should have an equal partner.

However, you being the sole provider while also doing the chores is going to tank your mental health even more.

I hope the best for both of you.", "NTA\n\nShe's an adult, she needs to get her life together and do SOMETHING... back to school, get a job or at least show a little bit of responsibility.

Wish her well but move on with your life.", "NTA. \n\nThis is exactly what every person should do in this situation. You are both young, you aren't married, no children are involved. You are just building your life, and shouldn't be responsible for fully supporting another adult human. \n\nYou supported her when she quit and gave her the opportunity to get it together. \n\nYou told her you were unhappy and what needed to change- it is on her to get therapy and work on improving her life. \n\nShe didn't change, so you changed the situation. \n\nAt 21, you shouldn't be supported a partner, especially when there is no end in sight. I'd be happy to- and have- helped my partner between jobs or when they took a break for school. And I've been there when they have suffered from depression.

It doesn't have to be a hallmark movie.", "Its conflicting. \n\nSounds like you kicked her out after only about a week. A few days of being not ok and you contact her parents and have her removed for not making you meals and not being ok.\n\nBeing in a relationship means helping each other. \n\nWas there any way you could have taken paid time off to spend a bit of time together and help her back on track? Or have her friends come over? Or make her an appointment with a therapist and tell her to go talk to someone? \n\nSeems very very quick to just have her go. \n\nIt seems to be your choice though and maybe there are other things going on but relationships are more than just who earns what and who is doing what chores and when.
