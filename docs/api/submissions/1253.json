So my aunt passed away earlier this year due to health complications. My aunt lived in Mexico and I live here in the states. Growing up I visited Mexico sometimes and have only seen my aunt a couple of times. When I was 11 years old my family decided to live in Mexico for 2 years but even then my relationship with my aunt was practically non existent and her daughters ( my cousins) weren\u2019t nice to me (they were very snotty and entitled because they were raised that way by their mom) . My father always explained that even his relationship with his sister was not great, also given the fact that they grew up very poor. So back to earlier this year when she passed, I was very sick with COVID and so was my 1 year old daughter, unfortunately my dad was hospitalized due to COVID too . When my mom hit me with the news of my aunt passing I tried to message my father my condolences because I was sick and couldn\u2019t see him in person. My brother had also notified me that my dads cell was dead so I shared my condolences with my mother. When everyone was feeling better and COVID free I visited my family thinking things will be okay but I was wrong, I was immediately given cold behavior from my dad and he even refuses to make eye contact with me sometimes till this day. So my mom made it clear to me that my dad expected more emotion from me because my dad and I used to be \u201cclose\u201d but the way I was had changed our relationship. But honestly my dad kicked me out of our house when I was 19 (I\u2019m 22) and I felt like THAT was what changed everything. My dad was not really nice (i have to word it that way because \u2026.Reddit) so of course I left and didn\u2019t come back because that was my chance to get away from that. My family is still mad/cold with me because I chose to live with my partner and not go back home to the bs my mom also feels that I should apologize to my dad for \u201cbetraying\u201d him) \u2026.I\u2019m so confused so I\u2019ve come here because this had been mentally torturing me for years , AITA?\n\n\n\n\nEdit: in my defense I\u2019m not an emotionless Ahole I just felt that I couldn\u2019t have genuine grief towards someone I barely knew. \n\nGiven my relationship with my family , the few times I do visit them 70% of my parents conversations with me are on how I gained weight after having my daughter, I know it\u2019s okay to be concerned but they\u2019re more concerned on my weight rather than something important like my mental health (I\u2019ve been admitted a couple years ago for you know what and we weirdly never talk about that)", "created_utc": 1667588267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym76z0/aita_for_not_grieving_my_aunts_passing/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
