Unless I call him and arrange to meet him and apologise to him for having a fight with my mom in front of him (and the rest of the family).\r  \nThe fight:\r  \nFirstly, this happened 10 months ago. My parents  invited their kids and grandkids for dinner. This included my brother, SIL, their kids, my sister, BIL and me. Our family get along great one-on-one, but as a large group, things sometimes get heated. This was one of those times. First my dad and my brother had a disagreement, shortly after my sister fought with my brother about his parenting style.  Then me and my mom took it to the next level and had a major fight, so I left before dinner was served.\r  \nMy mother and I have always had a strenuous relationship for various reasons. Unfortunately, when there is an issue between me and my mom. I can\u2019t just fight it out with her, because my sister and BIL will interject themselves into the situation, and then I end up fighting with them as well. My dad will always try to de-escalate the situation and sweep things under the rug. Thus, making it difficult for me to resolve issues with my mother and build a healthy relationship. In the last 8 years I have consciously been working on my relationship with my mother, putting in a lot of effort, and it has drastically improved. It helped a lot that I lived on the other side of the country, but I recently moved back, so boundaries are our biggest issue. I have a lot of them, and she struggles with them\u2026.\r  \n\r  \nA week after the fight my mother and I worked things out. I apologised for my disrespectful behaviour towards her. She apologised to me for starting the fight. We set new boundaries, and we made a lot of progress in our relationship. We have never been closer than we have been in the past year.\r  \nI explained to her my frustration. That I can\u2019t build a healthy relationship with her, if I have to fight 4 people every time, we have an issue. She has a beautiful relationship with my sister, they are as close as a mother and daughter can be. But that we will never have their relationship because I am not my sister, and we need our own relationship dynamic. She agreed to tell my sister and BIL to stay out of our fights, and she will work on her jealousy over the close relationship I have with my dad. \r  \n\r  \nMy bother asked on the group text that we rather do only 2-3 households together for dinners, rather than everyone. Christmas will be the exception. It has been hard on my parents but working out great so far.\r  \n \r  \nLater my BIL sent me a text. Stating that he has been unsure about sending this message or not. That what I did was childish. He was sick of the way I treated my mother. He is not picking a side about what happened just stating the facts. I am selfish. That I have no EQ.  That he has done so much to help me improve myself, but I do not care about anyone else. From now on he refuses to be at any event that includes me and my parents.\r  \n\r  \n(Context: One of the ways that BIL has \u2018helped\u2019 me improve myself, was to schedule a session with my psychologist to berate me for attempting too un.alive myself. That he (BIL) knows it was not my diagnosed depression or because I was at rock bottom after being retrenched, losing my flat, or struggling with my then recent bipolar diagnoses, but it was attention seeking selfishness and cowardliness. It was in 2014 a month after the attempt, and he wanted my psychologist to be there because he was going to break me with the \u2018truth\u2019, and someone needed to pick up the pieces.)\r  \nUninvited to Christmas:\r  \nAfter not speaking to me for 2-3 months after the fight, me and my sister are on good terms again and things are going well\u2026 or so I thought\u2026 We have been calling each other almost daily, went shopping together, the usual. We did not really talk about the fight. I told her it was between me and my mother and had nothing to do with them. She feels that it is her mother, and she has the right to get involved and defend her. We tried to leave it at that and move on.\r  \nOur family has always had a rule: \u2018No one is alone on Christmas, no matter who you are you are welcome\u2019. Most people will spend one year with their side of the family and the next with the in-laws. However, for the last 12 years it has been our family and both my brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s in-laws, because both BIL and SIL\u2019s siblings live abroad. \r  \nChristmas is my sister\u2019s absolute favourite time of the year. She goes all out, decorating everything and everyone. Very specific about menus and traditions and who may bring what. For the last few years my sister hosted Christmas, because my mom doesn\u2019t want to anymore, neither does her MIL, SIL has decided that it is not worth the fights and criticism for not following so-called traditions, and I lived on the other side of the country.\r  \nI bought my first house and wanted to host this year, but then my sister told me BIL\u2019s sister and her family will be coming to visit from abroad and my sister will be hosting. I accepted it because it is a special occasion, and I can always host my first next year. \r  \n2 Weeks ago a friend told me she will be alone for Christmas this year and was hoping she could join us. She knows about our rule. I said yes, and out of curtesy I just checked with my sister if it would be fine. She responded with \u201cyes, but it could be awkward since you are not welcome\u201d. I was taken aback by this. This is the first she has mentioned it to me. She explained that it had to do with the fight from 10 months ago and that BIL said I am not welcome. However, she has asked him to make an exception and he said, I could possibly change his mind if I called him and arrange to meet up with him and apologised. He wants me to apologise to him for the way I spoke to my mother 10 moths ago. I said ok, then I won\u2019t be coming because I don\u2019t believe I owe him and apology. It has nothing to do with them. It was an issue between me and my mother, who I have apologised to, and we have sorted things out. Apparently, she has told my parents months ago that I will not be invited.\r  \nWhen my bother and SIL found out they immediately said, fine then they will be spending Christmas with me, and our parents can decide which party they want to join. This year would be a in-laws Christmas then. BIL has the right to not invite me, and I am okay with it now. (I was in my feeling for a minute, but it is what it is). However, when my sister brought it up again and I explained to her that I am okay with it, our bother and his family will be coming to my house and I will be hosting my first Christmas, and I am excited about it. She was not happy; she feels that I should apologise to them, and this means she will be excluded from next year\u2019s Christmas, and I am ruining Christmas. I said that I don\u2019t have a problem with BIL, if he has a problem with me, he needs to speak to me about it. \r  \nOnly to have my dad call me the day after to ask would I not be willing to give BIL a call and apologise so that I can be invited. I said no. Now I am starting to doubt myself. My dad, bother and SIL said I am NTA. My mother, sister and BIL says I am. \r  \nAITA FOR REFUSING TO CALL MY BIL AND APOLOGISE, THUS SPLITTING THE FAMILY FOR CHRISTMAS?\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1700090227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w7315/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_bil_and_apologise/", "score": 65, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYour BIL sounds like an absolute narcissist.  As you said, the fight with your mother was between you and her.  He has absolutely nothing to do with it. The fact he is continuing to interject himself perfectly illustrates the concerns you allayed to your mother. \n\nIts your BIL's decision to choose to die on this hill, not yours.  Don't apologize to him.", "NTA you aren\u2019t whose splitting the family. If I were you, I\u2019d plan my own meal without him but including your sister and their kids if they have them. He can come when he apologizes for putting his nose into business that isn\u2019t his.", "NTA. The most troubling aspect of your post is his need to interject himself with your psychologist after self harm. Like his opinion and feelings were the most important aspect of the situation. He has to be the centre of everything and this Christmas non-invite is just another example of that. He is obviously the main character. I\u2019m puzzled as to why your mother is supportive of this non-invite when you and she have made peace. I guess your request to not involve others in your issues fell on deaf ears. Her favouritism is showing here I think. Do not apologise and stand your ground to host your own Christmas regardless of if any family attend or not.", "BIL has some very large (xmas) balls! What a controlling buffoon.  He is an in law...it is not his place to dictate how YOUR family dynamic works. Like honestly I cannot believe how big his Xmas balls are. Op 100% you are NTA.\n\nAnd to \"try to break you with your truth\" with your therapist! I hope to all the gods and goddesses that the therapist shut that crap down.", "NTA -BIL sounds like an absolute control freak - he's the one causing a rift. He's holding a grudge for a situation that is already resolved. Just do your Christmas with whoever comes to your place and enjoy yourself. Let him sit on his high horse with a grudge about a fight that didn't even involve him and is causing a family rift because he feels like he deserves a sit down apology - for what exactly?", "Easily NTA after reading your detailed narratives of issues surrounding your BIL.  He seem to hold grudge very long time and refuse to let it go at the expense driving rift on family tradition.\n\nIf he want to be an AH then he is welcome to reap what he sow.", "NTA I don't get why you have to apologize to someone who starts fights and gets involved in altercations of everyone else.  They can spend the holidays with you and your family.  Your mom is a rug sweeper and wants the peace so she can see her grandchildren or your sister but screw that.", "BIL needs to stay in his lane and stop splitting up the family. This one is on him. NTA", "NTA, obviously your brother and sister feel the same way and care about supporting what\u2019s right. Your parents are just trying to keep the peace (the usual parental stance rather than supporting who\u2019s correct). And definitely don\u2019t apologise, rather BIL should apologise for sticking their leg in everyone\u2019s business.", "NTA.  Your BIL is interjecting where he has no business to be.  Your relationship with your mother is exactly as you said, between you and her.  It's none of your BIL's business.  Do not apologise to him!  Have a great christmas with your brother, SIL & friend.  You are not causing issues here, your BIL who seems to think everything is about him is the problem.", "NTA. Have your first Christmas at your house with your brothers family and your friend. Let BIL figure out he doesn't call the shots. Goblin King, Goblin King... You have no power over me.", "NTA - So, you and your mom made peace, and everything was okay with the plans, until you BIL decided to stir up trouble by demanding an apology. The only one who should apologize is him for causing the rift. Maybe he is doing it on purpose, or maybe he's just a control freak.", "NTA.  \n\nTell your BIL that you have more of a complaint against him for his arrogance and judgement directed and you and his meddling in your relationship with your own mother.  If anyone is owed an apology, it is you, and his turning it all on you and expecting you to apologize is just another example of his high-handed arrogance, sense of superiority and judgmental personality.  He is splitting up his wife's family and should be begging everyone for forgiveness.\n\n(I really dislike him)\n\nEdited to clear up a muddled bit of writing", "NTA, BIL is a control freak that seems to love drama and attention. Enjoy your Christmas and let your parents grow spines, and tell BILand sister to grow up or shut up", "NTA. Your BIL is full of himself and needs to take his head out of his ass long enough to see that it is him who is creating these issues. Don't say anything to him until he apologizes first for they way he's been treating you", "I was gobsmacked at the whole psychologist intervention your BIL did on you and how/why your family allowed him to do it to you.\nHe comes across as a big time bully and shoehorning himself into an argument between your mother and you is a definite no-no. Same goes for your sister, she doesnt get to police your relationship with your own mother! The audacity of these two is stunning!\nNTA by a long, long mile. Please have your Christmas in your home, with your brother and SIL. You aren't splitting the family up - your highhanded BIL is. He wants you to spend Christmas on your lonesome onesome, does he? Pfft! Please don't fall for his bullying.", "He was not involved in this fight between you and your mother. Also you and your mother have moved on past the fight, discussed what went wrong, and seem to be getting along better.\n\nI would just tell your sister well next year her husband won\u2019t be welcome into your home when you host Christmas as he will still be waiting for that apology. NTA", "NTA. from the history of family fighting you have shared, it sounds like a great idea to split the family for Christmas! Don't apologize, it is outrageous that he thinks you owe him an apology. Host Christmas and see who shows up. Enjoy the break from BIL", "NTA \n\nEnjoy your Christmas and now you never have to be subjected to your toxic bil again", "Updateme", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. Your BIL has overstepped on so many occasions that I would be tempted never to see him again and make it clear that if he attends an event then you will not. The fact that he is getting involved in a fight between you and your mother astounds me. And what on earth does he need an apology for, he is not involved. I will say this, the way your family expects you to apologize or have asked you too doesn\u2019t sit well with me. I think it says a lot that your brother chose without hesitation to attend your Christmas and not theirs. \nYour mother and sister might have a great relationship but if your mother wants to continue to back her up and never you, she may not be worth trying to fix the relationship with. And if my sister uninvited me from Christmas that would be the end of any daily phone calls and shopping trips.", "NTA your bil creeps me out\u2026", "NTA. \n\nYour BIL is a shit stirer who feels he's entitled to meddle in everyone's business, and he's always right. \n\nYou had a fight with your mother. He and your sister jumped in and escalated the situation 10 months ago.  Since then, apologies have been made, and everyone, save for BIL, have made up and been fine.\n\nHis need to be in the middle of things and an unwillingness to let things go, especially things that didn't concern him in the first place, is what's splitting the family for Christmas. \n\nYou don't need to apologize to him, and if you do he's just going to keep escalating his behavior.  He *needs* you to be wrong and a troublemaker and will do whatever it takes to  put you in that position. There's no placating him, and you need to stop trying. \n\nTake this opportunity to host Christmas with those who truly want to spend the holiday with you and stop some of the family drama of having everyone together.", "NTA- your mother forgave you for the argument you had and your relationship is better for it. I don't understand why your BIL is still pressing this issue at all. Besides you are not the one splitting up Christmas. You were uninvited, not the other way around.", "Maybe stop fighting in front of others and others would interject themselves. \n\nI do believe you owe an apology to those you fought in front of because it\u2019s rude. But he\u2019s taking to another level by demanding one. \n\nESH. \n\nYou all need to learn to control yourself properly and handle your business amongst yourselves.", "ESH the fight 10 months ago seemed to escalate and involve everyone one but BIL. Causing a scene in front of group is never cool and would make anyone not directly participating feel awkward and offended.  People need to pick their time and place.  I don\u2019t think it needs to be production of apology but if I had a blowout so big I left the family dinner, if I am going to apologize to the source of my anger then you are damn straight I would also apologize to the audience who had to be exposed to it.  I hope the others involved would too (not just OP).", "I bet this Christmas is one of your best ones. No screaming fights (you do have a volatile family\u2026) No BIL butting in where he doesn\u2019t belong. No one treating you like a child and demanding a personal apology (looking at you, BIL.) Enjoy the peace. NTA", "BIL likes injecting himself into it so he and sister can be the favorites.", "Thanks for your feedback", "Thank you.  I am really excited to host my first Christmas. Have a lot of ideas to make it fun and easy. I am only have 3 decorations to put out... may need to get a tree. No they don't have kids.", "thank you for your feedback", "Psychologist prepared me for the session, and it had no effect on me. We just sat and allowed BIL to vent. Come to think of it, it was a similar thing of BIL and sister is not going to speak to me until... I may be remembering wrong.\n\nThank you for the feedbcak", "thank you for your feedback", "yeah it is long... thanks for the feedback", "I bet if OP stands firm, BIL either backs down or parents chose OP because brother will be there with the only grandchildren. \n\nNTA if the fight was truly between you and your mother, it\u2019s not BIL\u2019s business and he doesn\u2019t need or deserve an apology.", "thank you for your feedback", "thank you for your feedback", "thank you for your feedback", "thank you for your feedback", "thank you for your feedback", "thank you for your feedback \n\nI have tried to explain it but it fell on deaf ears", "thank you for your feedback - I needed to hear this", "thank you for your feedback\n\nI don't really need one from him, I just need him to his lane", "thank you for your feedback\n\nFamily knew of the appointment, I never shared what was discussed", "thank you for your feedback\n\nwould love the to be petty but it won't be received well by anyone...", "thank you for your feedback\n\nI agree I think it could be a good thing. I missed a Christmas or two while living in the other city. It actually made me appreciate them more, experience other families traditions and it was awesome. I can skip the stuff I don't like and try new things...", "thank you for your feedback", "thank you for your feedback\n\nPartly I don't blame my sister, because it is her husband and she need to support him, it is his house, and his space. If he does not want me there, she needs to respect that. She also shares his feelings on the matter, that they have the right to get involved.\n\nWhat I do struggle with the most is the nonchalant way she uninvited me. I am very hurt by it and humiliated, and I have said it to her, but I am not angry.\n\nI have tried not to make any decisions on our relationship while I am still in my feelings. Stopping our daily conversations will hurt her, and cause issues between us, before I even know if I want to go low contact. We try to keep things light and avoid the topic of Christmas. I am leaning towards a much lower contact in future at the moment, but I still need time.", "thank you for the feedback and support", "Bro that fight was almost a year ago. Chill.", "I do agree with some of what you said - thank you for your feedback", "The way he address this is wrong. It seemed everyone on OP\u2019s side of the family was getting into everyone\u2019s business and fighting. Not just OP. Also OP has mentioned that her and her mom have moved on. Why is he still so upset if they have squashed the issues and worked through it. He should be happy, not demanding an apology. If he had said to OP, FIL, MIL, and BIL \u201chey I\u2019m telling everyone this year there will be no fighting at our house. If anyone starts a fight they will be asked to leave.\u201d I think that would fare as he\u2019s telling everyone this. Not just signalling OP out.", "I am optimistic. Unfortunately you are not wrong about the 'volatile family'... \n\nI am working on myself to not be contribute to that, and have seen I treat conflict very differently with my other relationships, just need to translate that to my conflict with family as well.", "The joke is on him then, because OP's brother and SIL called him on it and now joining OP for Christmas.", "It sounds to me like OP's parents will choose the sister and BIL; after all  OP's mom is very close to OP's sister, and while OP's dad is close to OP, OP's dad is also apparently not great at confrontation and prefers to sweep things under the rug.\n\nOP, have you pointed out to your mother that what your BIL is doing is a perfect example of him and your sister inserting themselves into disagreements between you and your mother? (Also, do your sister and parents know what your BIL said to you and your psychologist?? Because OMFG, if they do, I do NOT understand how they can accept having him in their lives...)", "He really is the one causing drama - all of this would be old news without his pot-stirring, drama queen antics. Don\u2019t you dare apologize and further feed his tyranny over you and your family. \n\nSis picked him - she can live with the consequences of her awful taste in men.", "That\u2019s all fair enough, I think it\u2019s a good idea to let it rest for a bit before making any decisions about contact. And while I do understand that\u2019s it\u2019s his house etc I just don\u2019t think you have done anything to deserve to be treated this way. And I don\u2019t know why he has involved himself in a fight with your mother. I think they are trying to throw you under the bus, maybe a bit of a jealously that your relationship with your mother? It sounds like he wants an apology but does your sister want one? \n\nOne thing also is that you don\u2019t want to stop your daily conversations etc because it would hurt her, what about the way she has hurt you? Has she thought about your feelings at all? Uninviting someone from Christmas over something that happened 10 months ago is hurtful. You have the right to be hurt about this.", "You're a better person than me. \n\nYour sister is enabling him at the very least. \nThe way your parents and these toxic twins cosupport each other is astounding. \n\nPlan your Christmas but be prepared for them to up their little war.... \nAt this point I think you really should be considering going no contact with all of them. \nBut if not tell them you'd be willing to welcome them to your home when your BIL apologises for inserting himself in an argument you were having with YOUR mother and for berating you after your unalive attempt, thank god your therapist had your back!!! \n\nNTA", "Hence what I said BIL was taking it to another level. \n\nShe also said this is how the regularly handle things, which is why I said they need to learn to control themselves. \n\nReading comprehension. Try it.", "thank you for your feedback\n\nI think also my parents will be going to my sister for the exact reason you mentioned.\n\nNo my family is not aware, since at that stage I had a difficult relationship with my sister and BIL as well. Most of the family was struggling to accept and understand my diagnoses, in a way still do (SIL is excluded from this statement cause since day one she educated herself and was supportive, and tried to educate the family as well). Brining it up now would be seen as petty."]}
