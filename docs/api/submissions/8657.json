I am agnostic and have been since I was a teenager. It's  a touchy subject in my family because they all are church goers and I've turned away from religion.

I was fine with this since I don't have an issue with them and figured they'd do a good job since they've done it before. I get a call today from my grandma (84F) that the bridal shower is going to be at her church, which my mom still attends. I didn't like the idea so I posted on Facebook asking for bridal shower venue recommendations. My mom (60F) immediately texts me freaking out that I'm going to upset them and that I'm putting her in a tough position since reservations were already made. I had no idea because no one ever told me anything until now! The reason they want it there is because it's the cheapest they could find. They asked my mom and she told them no because I would never want it there since I'm not religious, but they reserved it anyway. My mom's worried about causing conflict with her sisters and says I should just go along with it. So...AITA for looking for other options?\n\nEDIT: This is the same church I went to growing up. I have bad memories and always hated going. Also, today was the first I was told about it and they made the decision a week ago after my mom told them no.

Or,  they can honor your wishes.", "NTA-Your mom told them what you wanted and they reserved it anyway. Disrespectful.", "NTA.  Honestly it\u2019s incredibly rude that your aunts chose a church.  Somewhere they should KNOW you wouldn\u2019t want to have a bridal shower in.  They need to respect that you don\u2019t want your shower in a religious setting.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it was the \u201ccheapest\u201d.  I mean, if it was the reverse, I\u2019d definitely bet money they\u2019d be just as uncomfortable and wouldn\u2019t want a shower for themselves in say, a witch\u2019s coven or a Satanic temple even if it was the cheapest option", "INFO - Are you willing to pay for the other option?\n\nINFO - The title says \"in a church\". Is it in the sanctuary or in a large room attached to the church structure or a large room somewhere on the church property?", "Did you give them free reign to book or did you say they had to approve where it is? I'd say NAH if you say \"never mind,\" but can't expect them to book it elsewhere. \n\n\nMy brother has had birthday parties for his kids in his shul. It's a room. Absolutely nothing religious about it. Except that he doesn't have to pay to rent it. I hate organized religion, but have been tempted to use it if I had an event. If your family is getting a really good deal on a space, you can't expect them to spend a lot more. It's not like it's in the sanctuary, it's a generic rec room.", "If they had asked you, I'd say n a h, because I've definitely attended my fair share of Catholic services despite being agnostic (my grandmother's funeral mass was particularly rough, but luckily my favorite cousin--who is Catholic, but not obnoxiously so--was sitting next to me, so we could comfort each other. And on my other side was my Dad, who's Buddhist, so neither of us took communium, lol), and sucked up the awkwardness for the sake of my loved ones' beliefs, but if it's a day specifically about YOU and it makes YOU uncomfortable and you weren't given any warning, NTA.", "NTA. Your mom told your aunts no, but they rented it anyway. You have bad memories from this church, and, I don't know how your shower is set up, but every one I've been to has been rather bawdy and not something that many would be comfortable having in a church (even if it is the fellowship hall it's so the church's building).", "INFO - are you going to pay for the venue?", "Soft YTA. Lots of churches rent out their halls and resources for non religious events and celebrations. Unless they\u2019re asking you to hold some sort of religious ceremony, I don\u2019t think you can be too angry considering you gave them free reign. They\u2019re just trying to help.", "Look I'll say YTA a bit here. \n\nI'm agnostic myself, and would not want an event for me to be turned into a religious ceremony. That being said churches are one of the most affordable places to rent out in a lot of communities (especially if a member is the one renting it out) so them renting out the fellowship hall makes total sense. \n\nPlenty of non-religious organizations rent out church spaces like the girl scouts, AA, the boy scouts, ect. \n\nNow I don't know your family so maybe I'm wrong and there was malicious intent, but you should have at least given them the courtesy of a direct conversation before openly searching for other offers on social media, especially since they have been taking their time to plan this for you. If a church really bothers you and you are paying for the venue then that's a valid conversation to have because at the end of the day the event is for you, but it feels like you are assuming Ill intent on their part while also not trying to talk to them about it.", "NTA. Your shower, you should enjoy it. But maybe talk to them a bit more. If it\u2019s purely a venue space with no religious stuff happening maybe it\u2019s not that bad. I\u2019ve known plenty of agnostic people who will hire church halls etc as often they are cheaper.", "It's in the actual church or in a banquet hall/garden on the same site? It's not like they're going to have mass during the shower. If they're just using a banquet room then you're overreacting, slight YTA. A church is just a building.", "Soft NTA. Call the church and ask for their rules or restrictions. If they are acceptable to you, then go with it. \n\nIt\u2019s just a building unless you believe.", "Slight YTA here because if you are agnostic, what do you really care if your bridal shower is in a church because it was the most affordable place? It's just a venue. And they're arranging it for you. So I get why churches aren't that palatable, but IMO it's not worth the conflict to try to fight this. Just be gracious.", "[deleted]", "NAH, assuming you didn't name names or do anything other than ask for venues in the post. As a non-religious person myself, I would just confirm with them, and then clarify on the invites that there would be no religious content to the event. A venue is a venue. I doubt they had malicious (i.e. evangelical) intent, unless you know better.", "YTA. A bridal shower is a party given for you. You\u2019re agnostic, not atheist, so it shouldn\u2019t matter to you.", "NTA for not wanting in the fellowship hall but YTA for seeming to be ungrateful for their efforts. You to,d them to plan it, they went for the cheaper option. It\u2019s not like you have to say prayers or anything. Our hall often had community events there. If you feel that strongly mcancel the shower or handle it yourself.", "*my aunts (65 and 63F) on my mom's side volunteered to arrange the bridal shower. I was fine with this since I don't have an issue with them and figured they'd do a good job* \n\nYTA. First, you gave them complete control over organising it, and then instead of liaising with them, you started reorganising it without talking to them first. This isn't about church vs agnostic, this is about getting people to do things for you, and then saying \"Oh but that's not what I want\" AFTER they've started organising it. \n\nYour wedding is going to be a shambles if you don't get better at communicating directly with people. For example, when your aunts first offered to arrange the shower, you could have told them what kind of event you had in mind. Having it at a church doesn't mean it's a super religious shower, just that the church has reasonably priced venue rooms - sometimes with an accessible kitchen area, which would give them the option of providing the food independently. \n\nSit down with your aunts and start again. Make it clear what you want and don't want at a shower. Have a look at the venue, before you veto it, and if they are arranging all this for you, then you have to consider the cost and convenience from their perspective. If you want a more expensive venue then maybe you have to wear the cost.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been to loads of events at churches that weren't remotely religious, but if this particular church has bad memories for you then that is understandable. Is this shower going to be large enough that you need a venue as opposed to someone's home? Can you explain to your aunts the bad times you had there or will they just brush it off?\n\nIf you have a lot of bad memories about this place and you just found this out today you might be having a bit of a panic attack / trauma response over it.

If you\u2019re not religious or religiously practicing any faith, the church building is only a building to you - or should be - as it holds no meaning for you. Weddings and showers can be wildly expensive; the family went with a low cost option. Don\u2019t fault them for that.  The money they saved in the venue can be put to something you enjoy more: food, games, decorations. They are gifting this shower to you, you are not the planner; be gracious. \nThe unpleasant memories just sound like they are because you were forced to go there when you took confirmation classes. I was forced to go to swimming lessons when I was a kid but I don\u2019t avoid beaches as an adult. \nIt\u2019s a shower in the fellowship hall.

Unless your \u201cbad memories\u201d involved an actual traumatic event that happened to you inside the church, you should just go along with your aunts\u2019 choice of venue.  \n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume the shower will take place in one of the church *meeting rooms*.  It\u2019s not as if you\u2019ll be in the sanctuary singing and praying!   Lots of non-religious events happen in church meeting rooms:  blood drives, immunization clinics, book sales, and even public voting.  You won\u2019t be infected with religious cooties at your shower.\n\nYour aunts are the hosts of the party, and you are the guest of honor.

Then NAH", "I mean either way she was going to have to confront them. If she wanted to change the shower location they would have to know. I get not wanting to confront religious family but also a lot of events that are not religious in nature (girl scouts, boy scouts, AA) meet at churches for cost reasons, so I don't even think it's fair to say this was trying to force actual religion on OP.\n\nIn the end it is OPs shower so what she wants is what matters, but it does seem petty to actively start looking for other venues publicly instead of talking with the people she let plan an event for her.", "So she roundabout/passive-aggressively confronted them...genius move.", "Yeah not a great move- but I don\u2019t think it makes them an asshole per say.  Just not the best decision", "OMG it's YOUR shower, no one should be concerned with how anyone else but you feels.
