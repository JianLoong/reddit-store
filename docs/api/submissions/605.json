You'd be completely failing in your duty as a parent if you didn't grok that and plan for it.     \n\n\nBefore writing off dance, though, I'd make an effort.  There are studios out there that are open and affirming of all body types  (I should know, i found one for my kid!)    Going to a performance there is really quite lovely.

I have friends who had no real future as adults in ballet have breast reductions after being told they were too busty to progress, even though they wouldn\u2019t have anyway.

My eating disorder began at about 13, I was suicidal by 16, second huge breakdown at 19.

Yes. YTA\n\nNot every little girl who does into ballet develops eating disorders, or has bad mental health. What ultimately supports that path is her support system around her.

Millions of people do ballet professional (which she doesn't even want right now. She just loves ballet which is healthy and good for her to do something she loves.) Without falling into the path of peer pressure to be perfect.\n\nYou are pushing YOUR insecurities onto a child who doesn't see her own bodily insecurities yet and shouldn't fucking feel ANY. By barring her from Ballet it's gonna start a path of \"why wasn't I good enough for Ballet?\" \"Am I not good enough for any dance class?\" Because kids minds while innocent and pure can quickly turn into a minefield of negativity because they are getting to that age where peers turn into assholes and they are influenced by everything around them.

A 10 year old is still young enough that it is appropriate for a parent to be making judgement calls about \"sheltering\" her from destructive influences.  \n\nHowever... The harder job we have to do as parents is allowing kids to follow their passions and be prepared to do the ongoing, hard, hard, hard work of paying attention along the way, helping them see themselves with self-confidence, checking if they are getting shitty messaging and countering that with conversation and reassurance and other positive role models, yada yada yada.  \n\nBallet might actually be healthy and wonderful for her.
