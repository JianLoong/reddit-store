Ik this goes against the grain here but this is coming from someone with extreme sensitivity to smells because of migraines. I HATE when perfume and colognes are sprayed everywhere. I would HATE anyone for doing this to me.

That would definitely be a hindrance because they would have less staff at that point as well.

Could he have a medical condition causing BO? Yes, but he has shown that he is able to control it by using proper hygiene when he is talked to by management, then gets lazy about it again. Can it be possible me that he can\u2019t smell it? Yes, but when multiple people have talked to you about it multiple times, you KNOW you smell. Is the perfume bothering other coworkers? Possibly, but they all do the same just discreetly so how can they complain? Maybe him seeing that people need to do these things to even stand 10 meters away from him will show him he needs to clean himself regularly.", "**ESH**\n\nBut you're by far the bigger AH\n\nHe likely is struggling with mental health or other issues. You're just doing this deliberately when you could have gone to your boss or HR when it started and had the issue addressed properly. \n\nUnlike body odour, which is just unpleasant, perfumes - especially strong ones lingering in the air - can trigger serious health issues for a lot of people, from allergies and respiratory issues to migraine and more. So all you're doing is adding to the air pollution in your office AND potentially making anyone with sensitivities ill, which is no better than the guy you're complaining about. \n\nAnd your repeated statement that \"I don't even care\" makes you an even bigger AH. How are you any better than him if you \"don't even care\" if you're adding strong smells to the air in your workplace that other people then have to deal with? Just because YOU don't mind it? Well HE doesn't mind HIS smell. So you're both pretty much on equal footing here. \n\nESH. Go to HR and ask them to talk to him.

He does bath but usually ends up smelling awful because he sweats a lot.  He\u2019s also borderline obese.  In the summer he will usually cover himself with cheap body spray to hide the smell.

Frankly, I've heard of a lot of workplaces straight up banning perfume these days because of risks. I understand your frustration, but this is not an acceptable solution. Keep on HR and, in the meantime, maybe try some Vapor-rub under your nose?", "Everyone uses some kind of perfume, deodorants, body spray, room spray. But maybe when he can't see it. I did the same, the problem is always there, he works with us for more than a year. And after so much suffering, I just can't care anymore about what he feels. And this was addressed to my boss, and a lot of people talked with him about it. And as I said in my post, whenever he is told, the smell is gone for a week or so. And then he starts to smell again.", "Yeah, it is so bad that when I come home it feels like I still smell it.", "Yes, I won't use perfume anymore, because of what people here said. \n\nAnd he was told many many times, by management, by coworkers. It gets better for a week, and then he stops showering again.", "I understand it is rude, and I would prefer not having to do that. But what else can we do? He has been told, not once, but maybe 10 times already. Isn't him refusing to take care of that, more bad than us using whatever we can to help ourselves? I wish there wasn't an issue like this, but there is.", "We have international students where I work who don't shower. In their countries, wasted water to clean yourself is absurd when there's barely enough clean water to drink. So sometimes we have to have the tough conversation where we tell them the circumstances here are different and everyone is expected to at least shower every other day (it got to the point where other students refused to work near them because the smell was so bad). They got the idea, started showering more regularly, and everyone was happy.\n\nThis guy is a major AH if he straight up refuses to maintain basic hygiene even after being told several times his coworkers can't stand his smell. I doubt the guy will want to lose his job over this anymore than management wants to fire him but, if I were OP, I might let them know that I'm THIS CLOSE to quitting because of his smell and they might lose other employees over it as well. So their staffing concern is still valid but they're focusing on the wrong issue.\n\nAs far as management/HR goes, the conversation is simple, \"We've had this conversation before but unfortunately we need to have it again. You smell of sweat and it's so bad that it's affecting your coworkers' ability to work. We have a 'professional appearance' section of our handbook (if you don't have a handbook or a relevant section you need to make one asap and distribute it to all your employees) that states your work appropriate dress needs to be X, Y, Z and this includes hygiene. This is your first formal warning and we need you to fix this issue immediately (as in tomorrow). If you can't do that, we'll be on the road to letting you go. If you are having medical or personal difficulties that are making it impossible for you to maintain a basic level of hygiene, please let me know so we can work with you to resolve it.\"\n\nDocument everything. NTA", "Yes. I won't be using the perfume anymore, but room spray or something else less intense. And have another talk with my boss.", "I made an edit saying I don't spray it ON him, just towards him. He might be 5-10 meters from me. I wouldn't spray anything on another person.", "I totally get what you said. We had a coworker before, he had a medical condition which made him smell bad, but he was actively putting effort into making it less bad for everyone. Washing himself few times a day in the bathroom, using deodorants, changing his tshirt once a day while at work, etc. No one said anything. \n\nNow this guy, he doesn't care. And by intensifying smell with every day, I can tell he just doesn't shower. Monday it smells if you're close to him, but it's not that bad. Friday, all the workplace smells, you want to puke, your eyes are watering from it. It's bad. Really bad. \n\nI'm not really arguing with anyone. I learned I shouldn't use a strong perfume because of other people, and I won't. Complaints also didn't help, he works there for a year, and the problem was always the same.", "Thanks, I'll look into it!", "It's not a secret. He has been told many times, he had 'bro' talks with guys, who tried to help him, etc.", "Tell manager that it is diminishing the productivity of the rest of the workers?\n\nIf you have trouble focusing and need to take time to spray, seems you can't be as productive.\n\nNTA imo - I am all for decreasing levels of subtlety. If they don't get give a shit, why should you?", "You say he can't smell it in your post. He may have a legitimate medical condition that affects his sense of smell. It doesn't excuse him for not showering, but it would explain why he doesn't get why everyone keeps saying he stinks. If that is the case, you could get in trouble for harassing him. So talk to HR and let them handle it.", "K, but what about everyone else? I want to smell overloaded perfume just as much as I want to smell BO.", "If those people are doing it subtly, they aren't stinking up other people's areas like you are. \n\n\nIf you're spraying it AT him, it can be considered assault...especially if he has any reaction to it.", "Does not mean he is washing them or not washing very often. If he is not bothered by not showering I don't think unclean clothes are an issue.", "Lol can you get one of those automatic ones that sprays air freshener every few minutes or whatever? Idk what the work environment is like but if you are at a desk/cubicle this might save you some effort.", "How about a face mask with air freshener on it?", "No.  Many air fresheners are odorless. Some work by deadening the receptors in our nose. Some are scented but perfume is strong scent we apply to our bodies.", ">It\u2019s rude af, \n\nSo is BO, that's kind of OP's  point. If your smell makes co-workers want to gag, you need better hygiene or a better doctor. \n\nAnd I've worked with someone who has perfume sensitivity, it comes up, we all knew about it.", "Please update us on this after talking to management, I am invested now.", "Maybe you can get an air purifier? Or have the office help pick out candles? Or you can wear a mask when he comes over?\n\nIf he has a medical condition where he can't smell, doesn't matter. And tbh i don't believe he has a medical condition to make him stinky because you say that he will stop smelling for a couple of days when you tell him and then just go right back into it. It's more likely that he's just not showering every day when he should.\n\nAt this point you need to group together with the rest of your coworkers and confront your boss and HR.", "It's more than 'rude' at this point. You are openly bullying someone by your repeated actions towards them.", "If the perfume from your bottle makes it onto him, thats assault by definition. YTA. Complain to HR. if they wont do anything quit. You dont have the authority to make him change.", "Then I think you need to find someplace else to work if your HR team are so ineffective , and learn to use your words.  This is just such a mean way to behave and I'm sure you aren't like this in real life , and it's just frustration , but this is clearly a person that does not get it . So talk to him. Explain that you want to help , and talk to him like a person , don't spray him like a cat thats got into your yard\n\nEdit to add that I am now giggling at the thought of you out there with the Chanel No 5 and a gaggle of puzzled cats", "My husband used peppermint essential oil when he used to ride the city bus to work.   \n\nI bought him a keyring with stone in it (for the oil)to use. They make necklaces too but that stained my shirts. \n\nYou don't have to buy high priced oil either. Walmart has one he used to make sweaty folks bearable.", "Yeah i decided to reword it. Well if he refuses to change then the next step is being reprimanded. If you want it to stop your gonna have to really pressure your boss. I mean this is effecting the whole work environment. But having everyone spray perfume in his direction is just the total wrong way to deal with this.", "Or (and this is honestly most likely) he\u2019s just so used to it. I mean my home smells like me unless I use a candle or something\u2014 which I\u2019d be surprised if he did\u2014 and when you\u2019re surrounded by a smell 24/7 you don\u2019t smell it.", "This is actually a thing, some people can't snell... Someone I know has this condition, and as far as I know he is extra careful with his hygiene because if he smells, he can't know.\n\nIt might also be depression, or some other thing, but whatever it is, it's always a delicate subject to manage, therefore better talk to HR. Especially since OP isn't even being subtle about it, it might backfire", "I made an edit clarifying I don't spray it on him exactly, I spray the air towards him, he can be as much as 10 meters away.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Or vics vapor rub", ">it comes up, we all know about it\n\nBecause one coworker told you about their sensitivity, you think everyone tells every person they work with about their sensitivities and allergies?", "He\u2019s bullying them with his funk.", ">you think everyone tells every person they work with about their sensitivities and allergies?\n\nI mean, yeah. I also know when a co-worker has issues with peanuts. And I eat out of the office if I'm in a room with someone fasting for Ramadan.\n\nIn the case I referenced, it was a cubicle farm, and HR had Management send out a note to everyone to stop wearing perfume due to sensitivity. So everyone did. Because we're not monsters."]}
