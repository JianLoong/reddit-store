It gets worse from monday to friday, because the smell intensifies and on wednesday its already so bad, I want to puke and it makes my head hurt. \n\nNow, he's been told by people about it. He didn't believe anyone telling him that. One time he brought his t-shirt to another coworker and asked her if she can smell anything because he can't. That's ridiculous, but whatever. He's been told many many many times, and usually when he is told he smells really bad, a week after you can't smell him, because he might be putting effort into showering, but it doesn't last long. And at this point my manager said, she doesn't want to make him feel bad enough so he wouldn't leave, since we're short on people. \n\nAnd I am really sorry for him, he's probably super depressed and can't even shower, which happens. He's a good guy, always friendly and never mean or anything. But holy fuck, I can't suffer it. Imagine coming at work all happy and ready to start a day and then you're hit with this terrible stench, it always ruins my day instantly. \n\nSo anyway, whenever he works closer to me, I literally just spray perfume towards him, I don't even try to be subtle about it anymore, because I really can't take much of it. And I was told by another coworker I'm being an asshole about it. I don't see it really, but maybe I am?\n\n\nEdit : I want to clarify that I do not spray anything ON him, but more towards his side. For example, he can be 5 meters away, and I just spray it in the air, but towards where he is.\n\nEdit2: Everyone in my work place use some kind of spray just because of him, no one is bothered by it, no one ever complained about that. But people are doing it more subtle, whenever he's not watching. I did the same for a long time, but at this point I'm just done caring about how he feels, I do it whenever I can't bear it anymore, just spray the air towards him.\n\n\n\nEdit3 : Thanks for everyone taking their time to say something. I took few advices and I ordered some things to help me more than what I was doing before. To all the people trying to insult me, I think you could find a better way to spend your time than that. To all the people that been helpful, thank you. I learned its really not nice of me, and I will be more open about how I feel, and pressure the HR to do something about it or I will change my job.

And it doesn't stop body odor, so now people are just smelling flowery body odor which is worse. \n\n\nIf you can't stand the smell, put Vaporub or peppermint oil or something under your nose when he walks by.

He just decided he didn\u2019t want to waste the time showering and his parents were useless in enforcing it.\n\nHe changed clothes everyday but he STANK. When I moved across the country, he once came to visit my family for like a week and it was nearly unbearable. Everything he used - bed, couch etc - stank to high Heaven. My eyes were watering. I wanted to puke. It was embarrassing going out with him in public or having him around my friends.

That falls right in with heating up fish or burning popcorn in the staff microwave. Just don't do it. \n\nBut HR may need to be involved because there are legitimate medical reasons for people to have little to no sense of smell. He is still the asshole for not showering. But, if he does have a medical condition that affects his sense of smell, you could get in trouble for harassment. So, maybe talk to your boss and HR about more appropriate ways to handle it rather than aggressively spraying perfume at the problem.\n\nI seem to remember a post on here a while back about a guy with no sense of smell and he drove his friends down a really hot road near a landfill, or something. He wanted to know if he was the asshole for taking the shortcut when they begged him not to.

At best it's similar to listening to music on a speaker in public, basically forcing what should be a person choice onto everyone else's senses.

Ik this goes against the grain here but this is coming from someone with extreme sensitivity to smells because of migraines. I HATE when perfume and colognes are sprayed everywhere. I would HATE anyone for doing this to me. However, his smell would definitely give me a huge migraine just as much as the perfume would but at least it wouldn\u2019t stink. \ud83e\udd22 I would legitimately quit this job if I were you because I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it. That would definitely be a hindrance because they would have less staff at that point as well. But you might not be able to, and if the only way you can handle this is by spraying perfume in his direction (not on him that would be unacceptable) because he cannot take on the adult responsibility of showering then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for that. \n\nThere are some legitimate concerns from other commenters that I want to address. Could he have a medical condition causing BO? Yes, but he has shown that he is able to control it by using proper hygiene when he is talked to by management, then gets lazy about it again. Can it be possible me that he can\u2019t smell it? Yes, but when multiple people have talked to you about it multiple times, you KNOW you smell. Is the perfume bothering other coworkers? Possibly, but they all do the same just discreetly so how can they complain? Maybe him seeing that people need to do these things to even stand 10 meters away from him will show him he needs to clean himself regularly.", "**ESH**\n\nBut you're by far the bigger AH\n\nHe likely is struggling with mental health or other issues. You're just doing this deliberately when you could have gone to your boss or HR when it started and had the issue addressed properly. \n\nUnlike body odour, which is just unpleasant, perfumes - especially strong ones lingering in the air - can trigger serious health issues for a lot of people, from allergies and respiratory issues to migraine and more. So all you're doing is adding to the air pollution in your office AND potentially making anyone with sensitivities ill, which is no better than the guy you're complaining about. \n\nAnd your repeated statement that \"I don't even care\" makes you an even bigger AH. How are you any better than him if you \"don't even care\" if you're adding strong smells to the air in your workplace that other people then have to deal with? Just because YOU don't mind it? Well HE doesn't mind HIS smell. So you're both pretty much on equal footing here. \n\nESH. Go to HR and ask them to talk to him.

He just stank really bad especially after working for a few hours. I felt bad for him because everyone had something to say to him even the managers spoke to him about it but, he showered and he was really embarrassed. I felt bad for the guy. He was a bigger dude who stank. \n\nAlso this coworker has the choice to do what he wants with his body.

Lost his sense of smell from an accident when he was a teenager.  He claims he\u2019s allergic to the aluminum in antiperspirant, but they make ones that don\u2019t have aluminum in then.  He does bath but usually ends up smelling awful because he sweats a lot.  In the summer he will usually cover himself with cheap body spray to hide the smell.  He refuses to buy aluminum free stuff because he\u2019s really cheap.  I told I would buy it for him but he refuses.  So I just do my best to avoid him.

It may be worth it if they request the smelly guy to see a physician. There may be some options for this kind of issue if it\u2019s genuinely not connected to hygiene. However personal hygiene at work is a very reasonable expectation and good management means not keeping people who are disruptive whether it\u2019s because of poor hygiene or or reasons.

They got the idea, started showering more regularly, and everyone was happy.\n\nThis guy is a major AH if he straight up refuses to maintain basic hygiene even after being told several times his coworkers can't stand his smell. I doubt the guy will want to lose his job over this anymore than management wants to fire him but, if I were OP, I might let them know that I'm THIS CLOSE to quitting because of his smell and they might lose other employees over it as well.

And by intensifying smell with every day, I can tell he just doesn't shower. Monday it smells if you're close to him, but it's not that bad. Friday, all the workplace smells, you want to puke, your eyes are watering from it. It's bad. Really bad. \n\nI'm not really arguing with anyone.

Because he was told on a daily basis to shower by the instructors. \n\nThis is the same person who put his wet coat on a radiator in a lecture hall to dry because it was raining out. The room, with 100 people in it, had to be evacuated because of the smell.\n\nThe same person who was sent home from clinical rotations (in the medical field) because coworkers AND patients could not stand the smell of him. He would shower once and then not again FOR WEEKS. One of the supervisors at the medical facility put him on an appearance/cleanliness probation. He had to check in daily before he was allowed to work with the supervisor, and if he smelled or looked unkempt, he was sent home. 6 absences, and he would fail. It worked. \n\nI understand depression and mental health struggles are real. However, if you are able to get yourself to work/school/ wherever daily, you can take a shower and clean up, especially if you have been instructed to. If it's a matter of not having the money to shower or are homeless, maybe everyone can chip in and help him get a membership to a gym (there are a few gym chains that are $10 a month and have showers) so he can shower there.\n\nEdit: Your perfume spraying could have been less obvious, but for some people, being subtle doesn't work, and it seems as though this has been addressed by several people in several different ways.", "ESH You for how you have behaved.
