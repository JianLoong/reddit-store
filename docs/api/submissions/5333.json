It's messed up that you dismiss her loss by adding \"she has been able to have other children\" at the end, as if children are replaceable by having more children.\n2. As a pregnant woman, you would know that a \"late-term miscarriage\" is a stillbirth, so it seems like again, you're softening things to downplay her loss.\n3. You say nothing about even trying to have a genuine discussion with your cousin, just \"she doesn't want me to, I'm gonna do it anyway because I love the name\".\n\nWhen a child dies, it's absolutely a touchy subject. If you REALLY want to name your baby whatever name you want, yes, it's your right, and yes, you're an asshole for not only pushing on when she's said this is a very traumatic thing and it would upset her, but also for managing to dismiss her experience three times in a paragraph and a half. That's some cold stuff right there.", "YTA. In your mind it\u2019s your cousin\u2019s miscarriage. In her mind it\u2019s an actual real human that she loved and lost. Would you do the same thing if the baby had been born but hadn\u2019t survived? I think what you\u2019re doing is horribly insensitive.", "YTA. While I'm usually no one owns a name or date etc. Her child is DEAD. I doubt I'd associate with anyone I knew if they named their child my dead kids name.

Out of all the possible names, why does it have it be that one? Can you really not find another name that you would like?\n\nIt was a traumatic experience.

Is it a traditional family name? Are there really NO other names that you like?

A late term miscarriage is basically a stillbirth. \n\nWhat about this name is worth hurting your cousin AND having this hang over your child's head?", "Yes! YTA . Don\u2019t do that !! It\u2019s incredibly insensitive!", "YTA. What a cruel, selfish thing to do. That's literally the name she picked for her dead child. Something must be clouding your judgement.

Just why?\n\nWhy is a name worth causing pain to someone else?\n\nIf it was a matter of someone trying to call dibs on a name I\u2019d say tell them to pound sand.\n\nBut your cousin LOST her child and she has asked that you not use the name.\n\nGood Lord.

It feels like you're minimising her loss. She's family, and you should care about hurting her like that. No, she can't avoid the name forever, but it's very different when it's family. Why would you willingly subject her to that when you could easily find another name? And I must ask, would you have named your child the same name as hers had it lived?", "YTA I realise your cousin shouldn't be able to lay claim to a  name forever, but using it is horribly Insensitive.  \nIf you use the name then anytime someone mentions you and your child or she sees you in person or  on social media she'll have to relive that grief.  \nObviously she can't avoid a name forever, but having it right on her doorstep (which it will be via social media, regardless of how little you meet up) would be truly awful.  \nIt's not fair that you should pick something else but you still should. \nYou'd be losing a potential name, she lost her child-please try a bit more empathy", "Normally I would say who cares if cousins have the same name. But in this case YTA for doing that to your child. Your child isn't going to only have the same name as her cousin but the same name as their dead cousin and there will be family members that have a hard time separating that and it will show to your child regardless of how hard the family tries not to.
