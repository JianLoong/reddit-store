It doesn't matter if you've been dreaming of naming your baby this name since the day you were born. It doesn't matter if you only see her once a year. The context has changed. A baby with the same name died. A baby who was a member of your family, your cousin's daughter.\n\nDon't be that person. Find a new name.", "YTA for several reasons:\n\n1. It's messed up that you dismiss her loss by adding \"she has been able to have other children\" at the end, as if children are replaceable by having more children.\n2. As a pregnant woman, you would know that a \"late-term miscarriage\" is a stillbirth, so it seems like again, you're softening things to downplay her loss.\n3. You say nothing about even trying to have a genuine discussion with your cousin, just \"she doesn't want me to, I'm gonna do it anyway because I love the name\".\n\nWhen a child dies, it's absolutely a touchy subject. If you REALLY want to name your baby whatever name you want, yes, it's your right, and yes, you're an asshole for not only pushing on when she's said this is a very traumatic thing and it would upset her, but also for managing to dismiss her experience three times in a paragraph and a half. That's some cold stuff right there.", "YTA. In your mind it\u2019s your cousin\u2019s miscarriage. In her mind it\u2019s an actual real human that she loved and lost. Would you do the same thing if the baby had been born but hadn\u2019t survived? I think what you\u2019re doing is horribly insensitive.", "YTA. While I'm usually no one owns a name or date etc. Her child is DEAD. I doubt I'd associate with anyone I knew if they named their child my dead kids name. Family or not,  I'd remove you completely from my life.", "Yta. F*ck, how many names exist and yet how many pregnant people seem to stumble upon just one?! Any name that's problematic to an unborn needs to be changed and that's that.", "Would you be using the name had the baby been born alive?", "YTA - You should be honest about the fact you\u2019re not compassionate for your cousin if you proceed with naming the baby. Seeing as you\u2019re already trying to find ways to invalidate said cousins trauma to bolster yourself. \n\nEspecially if the miscarriage was a later term/20 weeks on/ where the cousin would still have to give birth to the deceased infant.", "Oof. This is probably the only situation in which I\u2019d say \u201cYTA\u201d for using someone else\u2019s \u201cclaimed\u201d name.\n\nIf you really want to do it, I think you should. Your baby, your choice, and you two aren\u2019t that close.

Generally I'm against the idea that people can \"claim\" names, but in this particular case I just think naming your baby that opened up a wound in someone you were close to growing up and still see. Do you really want your child to be a reminder of the baby she lost?", "Does it not worry you that anyone who knows you and your cousin may think of your cousins lost baby when they look at yours? I don't think I'd want that sadness around my newborn. My gut feeling when I read your post is YTA.

She had a stillbirth.", "Would you still have named your baby the same name if your cousin would have been a live birth? To me I would just have some compassion and find a different name. Unless you have some sort of connection to that name, I would be considering the fact that your cousin does have a very strong connection to that name and every time they see your child\u2019s name they will probably be reminded of their loss.

Her baby was stillborn not a miscarriage. \n\nIt's not a name of a living child. It's not the name of a future child.

A lot of different factors would play into making a proper judgement or decision in your case.", "Not sure why you felt that the fact she\u2019s been able to have other kids is relevant to the situation but YTA either way .

Now you\u2019re taking it too because you liked it?\n\nFind another name and don\u2019t throw a bomb into your family.", "I'm leaning towards YTA. Out of all the possible names, why does it have it be that one? Can you really not find another name that you would like?\n\nIt was a traumatic experience. I know you don't see each other to often, but every time that she sees your kid, she will be reminded of it.", "INFO This is a tricky one actually. Why is this name so important to you? Is it a traditional family name? Are there really NO other names that you like? It seems like not only would this justifiably upset your cousin but make her feel like the family is erasing the memory of a baby that she lost. A late term miscarriage is basically a stillbirth. \n\nWhat about this name is worth hurting your cousin AND having this hang over your child's head?", "Yes! YTA . Don\u2019t do that !! It\u2019s incredibly insensitive!", "YTA. What a cruel, selfish thing to do. That's literally the name she picked for her dead child. Something must be clouding your judgement.

Just why?\n\nWhy is a name worth causing pain to someone else?\n\nIf it was a matter of someone trying to call dibs on a name I\u2019d say tell them to pound sand.\n\nBut your cousin LOST her child and she has asked that you not use the name.\n\nGood Lord.

Now, every time she hears you call your child that name she will know you don\u2019t care about her feelings. There are thousands of names. You should pick another one.", "YTA. It feels like you're minimising her loss. She's family, and you should care about hurting her like that. No, she can't avoid the name forever, but it's very different when it's family. Why would you willingly subject her to that when you could easily find another name? And I must ask, would you have named your child the same name as hers had it lived?", "YTA I realise your cousin shouldn't be able to lay claim to a  name forever, but using it is horribly Insensitive.  \nIf you use the name then anytime someone mentions you and your child or she sees you in person or  on social media she'll have to relive that grief.  \nObviously she can't avoid a name forever, but having it right on her doorstep (which it will be via social media, regardless of how little you meet up) would be truly awful.  \nIt's not fair that you should pick something else but you still should. \nYou'd be losing a potential name, she lost her child-please try a bit more empathy", "Normally I would say who cares if cousins have the same name. But in this case YTA for doing that to your child. Your child isn't going to only have the same name as her cousin but the same name as their dead cousin and there will be family members that have a hard time separating that and it will show to your child regardless of how hard the family tries not to. Just make sure if you do decide to name them that do not under any circumstance advise the child that you were able to use the name because the cousin was dead.", "YTA. Like come on. There\u2019s millions of other names out there. Maybe I\u2019m different and I love and respect my cousins but this is something I would never do. The name isn\u2019t that special to you.", "YTA, how horribly insensitive, not only to your cousin, who I'm sure will distance herself from you forever, but also for your child, who will carry the stigma of being the \"Live One\".\n\nPick any other name.

Aside from the fact that it is an asshole move, I would also worry about tempting fate.", "YTA it seems you are doing a good job convincing yourself you aren\u2019t, miscarriage instead of stillbirth, you only see her a few times a year, she had more children \n\nNobody owns a name but know if you choose to move forward know that your first parenting decision is cruel and selfish. I am sure your daughter will find it unsettling, when she finds out.\n\nStop being an ass and pull out a baby name book like a decent person.", "YTA. Your cousin's pain is real and there's no need to put salt in that wound. Hurting a traumatized family member is quite a price to pay for a baby name, which there are thousands of.  \nHow hard can it be to find another name you like? In the end, it's the kid that matters.

Watching them grow up knowing that name was supposed to belong to your child, seeing this sweet baby who isn't yours but with the name you choose knowing that you would have also had the same experience if you hadn't lost your baby. Every time someone calls your cousins name you reminded once again that yours will never hear your voice, you'll never hear them call you mommy or see them rollover etc! Put yourself in her shoes!
