It's messed up that you dismiss her loss by adding \"she has been able to have other children\" at the end, as if children are replaceable by having more children.\n2. As a pregnant woman, you would know that a \"late-term miscarriage\" is a stillbirth, so it seems like again, you're softening things to downplay her loss.\n3. You say nothing about even trying to have a genuine discussion with your cousin, just \"she doesn't want me to, I'm gonna do it anyway because I love the name\".\n\nWhen a child dies, it's absolutely a touchy subject. If you REALLY want to name your baby whatever name you want, yes, it's your right, and yes, you're an asshole for not only pushing on when she's said this is a very traumatic thing and it would upset her, but also for managing to dismiss her experience three times in a paragraph and a half. That's some cold stuff right there.", "YTA. In your mind it\u2019s your cousin\u2019s miscarriage. In her mind it\u2019s an actual real human that she loved and lost.

It feels like you're minimising her loss. She's family, and you should care about hurting her like that. No, she can't avoid the name forever, but it's very different when it's family.

And I must ask, would you have named your child the same name as hers had it lived?", "YTA I realise your cousin shouldn't be able to lay claim to a  name forever, but using it is horribly Insensitive.  \nIf you use the name then anytime someone mentions you and your child or she sees you in person or  on social media she'll have to relive that grief.  \nObviously she can't avoid a name forever, but having it right on her doorstep (which it will be via social media, regardless of how little you meet up) would be truly awful.  \nIt's not fair that you should pick something else but you still should. \nYou'd be losing a potential name, she lost her child-please try a bit more empathy", "Normally I would say who cares if cousins have the same name.

They can't name themself. But grief does things to people sometimes and it can come out ugly", "YTA!\n\nShe had a still born..and you want to take her dead baby\u2019s name? This isn\u2019t some random persons baby that you don\u2019t even know or knew existed. \nThis is a family members baby..that died. \nFind a new name!", "YTA Their loved, wanted, planned for, excited to the moon about NAMED baby died. The. F. How do you think this is ok?", "YTA, do you genuinely think your future child would like being named the same as their dead relative? Get a grip.", "YTA\n\nYou would be incredibly cruel if you used that name. You can pick a different one.", "YTA. Everytime your child is mentioned to your cousin, is around your cousin, or interacts with your cousin, your cousin will be reminded of their dead child, the one they didn\u2019t even get to have a moment with. Every get together, every family holiday, every wedding, graduations maybe, she will be reminded of the image of her small lifeless child that never got to cuddle while they were alive. Are you ABSOLUTELY SURE this is the foot you want their relationship to start out on?", "YTA find a new name come tf on.", "Leaving aside the asshole question, cuz everyone else has covered that pretty comprehensively... is the name so important to you that you're ok with alienating your family? I'd imagine it's not just your cousin who's going to have feelings about this choice. So really the asshole question is secondary to the \"are the consequences acceptable to me\" question.", "The closest you could do is ask your cousin if you can give your baby the name for their middle name as tribute. Honor their wishes, losing a child is the worst imaginable experience. \n\nYTA", "Normally I think these baby naming things are nonsense, but in this case I think YTA. This was an incredibly traumatic experience for your cousin. Their baby was already named and loved. Pick a different name.", "I am in the exact same situation and I decided to find a different name to be respectful of my cousin. I can find another name, her daughter already has that one and it would bring her pain every time she sees my kid if I went with it. She went through something horrible that I hope I never have to experience and it\u2019s the very least I can do to show some kindness towards her and her loss", "YTA\n\nIn any other circumstances I would say use whatever name you like.\n\nBut it is very cruel to name your baby after someone else's dead baby.\n\nSure you don't see them that often but they will still hear about every birthday your child gets to have and be reminded of all the birthdays their baby didn't get to have.", "A late-in-pregnancy loss isn't a miscarriage, it's a stillbirth, a deceased child.  If your cousin's baby had died of SIDS at 2 months, would you be comfortable using the same name?  Because that's more of a comparable situation.", "YTA. You're being cruel to your child by naming her after a corpse.\n\nYou're literally talking about naming your kid after her cousin who just barely didn't make it into the world, just cuz it has a nice sound.", "YTA. It doesn't matter if you don't see her all the time. You may have the right to use any name you want, but you know that ever time anyone uses your child's name, it will bring up her traumatic grief. That means either she will avoid family events or she will be miserable throughout them. So you'll also cause tension for the rest of the family. And your child will eventually notice that your cousin and probably others are very standoffish with them, so you're impacting your kid, too. Try a small bit of compassion - there are plenty of other names", "Your cousin doesn't own that name.  In my family, ALL the first born sons were named after their grandfather.  So my cousins and brother all had the name Peter, and to keep them apart, they were called Peter J., Peter H, Peter 1, Peter 2, etc.  I had an older brother named Peter who died and my parents then called their second boy Peter also.  So name your child whatever you want.  She doesn't own the name.", "I feel like so many AITA posts would simply be resolved if OPs would simply put themselves in the other parties shoes and think about how it would make them feel for the same to be done to them.", "YTA. Pick another name. I will never understand why some people choose only one name and have their heart dead set on that. Have a couple of them you like just in case of this very scenario. For example, I used to love the name Isis. Pretty obviously things are different now in that I would not be calling my child Isis. Pick something else you like.", "YTA. While you\u2019re not extremely close anymore, out of the infinite number of beautiful names in the universe, you gotta glom on to that one? Really? YTA it\u2019s insensitive and really kinda cruel. Are you purposely trying to be cruel?", "Yta, omg has being pregnant sapped all the empathy and intelligence from you? What you want to do is sick.", "YTA", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA - Whether your cousin is able to have other children makes absolutely no difference. She still lost a child, it doesn\u2019t make her mourning any easier.", "YWBTA  that would be incredibly painful to her, as well as your other family members.  My sibling lost their son at birth, and it's hard for any of us to see his name anywhere, I can't imagine another family member knowing that and deciding to use the name for their own kid.  It's incredibly insensitive and cruel.  Pick another name.", "Nta you can't banned a person from using a name no matter the circumstances. So does not own the exclusive rights to that name", "YTA Choose another name. Any other name.", "YTA, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re legally barred from using the name. If you really want to use the name your kid, go for it. But you\u2019ll be the AH. Just figure out if you\u2019re ok with that.", "Hard to say really, if your cousin is not ok with it, then I wouldn\u2019t do it. If you really love the name then maybe make it a middle name?\nI lost my son a few days after he was born and if a friend or family member wanted to give their child the same name, I wouldn\u2019t be upset. It was a beautiful name with a lot of meaning so if it brought them joy, why not? But then again, everyone is different. \nGood luck.", "Are you serious? Do you have a heart? What is wrong with you for even thinking that it will be normal for you to name your baby the same way knowing the circumstances?! \n\nI'm sure you can find another name so stop trying to find excuses! Act better  Ps:YTA", "YTA heartless. Imagine if your baby died and a family member did something to ensure you were reminded of it forever\n\nThis is so cruel and unnecessary", "NTA", "NTA\n\n\nYou had a kid first.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s only a name", "everyone should be allowed to name their child however they want to, names can\u2019t be \u201cclaimed\u201d, so just go for it ig. It\u2019s not your fault that it happened to your cousin and you were planning to name your child that from the beginning anyway, so nta.", "In my family, all the first born sons were named after my grandfather.  My oldest brother was named after his grandfather, and when he died, the second son was given the same name.  In fact, ALL the first born boys in my family were given the same name.", "It\u2019s pretty straight forward though right? Two living children sharing a name is nbd. So using a name someone\u2019s already used or is planning on using is generally fine. The only exception is dead children. We don\u2019t use their names because we respect the magnitude of their family\u2019s loss. The etiquette is not hard to follow here (YTA op!).", "Agreed, using it as a middle  name would  be less blatant.", "Very high. She's already attempted to minimize the trauma her cousin went through by calling it a miscarriage instead of a stillbirth, and by saying \"she had other kids\" as if children are fucking hairbrushes you can just replace.", "Not a miscarriage...a stillbirth. She delivered a dead baby. That's what a late-term miscarriage is.", "Not a miscarriage, a STILLBORN. A late-term miscarriage is a stillborn. She had to deliver a dead baby. There is likely a grave with that name on it now.\n\nSure, OP is free to use the name, but she'd be a fucking asshole for doing it.", "Your family is naming each other after dead babies? Weird.", "Why does that matter, we name kids after dead relatives all the time? It's usually an honor.", "Frankly my birth name was a family name in my moms family. But she STILL checked with my granny on my dads side before using it because my granny had a baby she named that name and lost (at like 2 days old? But still she\u2019d have checked if it was ok even if it had been an early term miscarriage cause she\u2019s been through that herself and gets it) being compassionate to someone\u2019s loss is a huge part of not being an A imo, even if you wouldn\u2019t feel the same personally it\u2019s still important to check in on these things.", "I lost one at ~22 weeks, just a little too early to put on life support and attempt to save. My husband and I got asked to choose a name for her death certificate and when we declined she was given a generic name. The cousin definitely has a death certificate for her baby, she may still have it.", "Because it's a dead baby who never had a chance to live. Much different than grandpa who lived his life.", "So if you had a young child who died, say a 3 year old, you would be cool if a relative chose to name their baby after your dead kid?", "The husband of my former manager was named after his dead sister as the parents wanted to 'honor' her. Poor guy had to spend his life with people thinking his name was a mis-spelling or the registration dept made a mistake. Parents need to think whether other people will agree if it's an 'honor' or not.", "[deleted]", "I was named after my great aunt who was stillborn... It is a thing that happens, but to be fair my family had a whole generation of time to heal from the hurt of her loss", "So how long does someone have to live for it to be an honor?", "Idk but I would know that 1) I don't own that name and can't monopolies it's use and 2) there can be more than one person with the same name in the family. How far does my hurt feeling control what other people can and can't do? Can my friends never use this name? What about my coworkers? My neighbor who gave me a baby shower gift? Do I now control the use of this name, because something tragic happened to me?", "\ud83e\udd13", "For a family that has had a stillbirth that child\u2019s name is one of the only things they have.", "It solely depends on the family who lost. Clearly her cousin is not ok with that. So it wouldn't be an honor to them. And op is absolutely not doing this to honor them.", "You don't control the name. Anyone can use it. But if it's hurting someone to do a thing, and you can easily choose to not do it, it's pretty unkind to do it anyway just because there's nothing stopping you. This isn't Am I Legally Allowed, it's Am I The Asshole. Naming your kid something that's hurtful to a family member isn't kind.", "It\u2019s not that OP\u2019s cousin is trying to control her, but rather that the cousin would be upset at the reminder of her child that never got to live. It\u2019s different if it\u2019s a coworker because you\u2019re not forever tied to your coworker like you often are with family. Even if she doesn\u2019t see her cousin much, other family members may talk about \u201c(daughter) said her first word today!\u201d, \u201c(daughter) started school today!\u201d etc. which would be a painful reminder.", "It\u2019s called empathy.", "Yes exactly!!", "Yes, I am a mother and have also lost a baby; I know how it works. What I was referring to was the birth and death certificates. Also, as I said above, using the name doesn\u2019t give someone the right to forbid others to use it. \n\nI get that my opinion is the outlier here but I stand by it. I don\u2019t believe that prohibiting the use of a name is going to minimize the mother\u2019s pain. We all have to learn to cope with our own trauma, and as hard as it is to lose a baby, avoidance and controlling others isn\u2019t the answer.", "If it\u2019s after 20 weeks you get a birth & death certificate. And have your opinion, obviously you are entitled to it. \nJust as I am entitled to think that choosing to trigger trauma when you could just pick another name is cruel. \nNot to mention the effect on the kid when they inevitably hear the story. That\u2019s got straight to therapy written all over it.", "Thank you for that information and thank you for being able to respectfully disagree with me. I get your position, I really do, I just have difficulty with the idea of having to actively avoid \u201ctriggering trauma\u201d, as you put it. Depending on the name, this person is likely to encounter it out in the world, at their kids\u2019 school, on TV and in movies, etc. I take issue with people who use bad things that happen to them as an excuse to be emotionally unstable. \n\nWhen something bad happens to me, I get therapy and learn how to cope with it. I don\u2019t expect everyone around me to cater to my trauma. My feelings and reactions are 100% my responsibility."]}
