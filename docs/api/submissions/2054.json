The three oldest grew up with their dad in another state from the ages 8&7.  Their dad kept all contact with me to nothing because of who i was dating. I raised my younger daughter (now 13) who is their half sister and knew before they left to live with their dad. A few years later i had my youngest (now 6F) . Right before COVID hit I had reconnected with my children and started repairing my relationships with them. I went up to the state they were living in to arrange transfer of custody. That fell apart and so I went back home and continued with raising my youngest two, all while keeping in touch with the older three. I became a grandmother and I was ecstatic to have a grandbaby. I was repairing the relationship with my daughter and getting to know my granddaughter.\n\nI had moved to a different part of my state which happened to be closer to my grandchild and daughter. So I was able to see them more. My grandchild came and spent time with me and my younger daughters, getting to now this side of her family. This also gave my daughter a chance to reconnect with her younger sister and get to now her youngest sister. All was well. We were happy. Then it happened.\n\nMy sister and I saw a post by daughter saying happy sisters day to her sister that is 19 and other girls she calls her \" sister\". Not anywhere in the post did she recognize her two youngest sister. MY sister and I had made a generalized post on FB about how when you call out one sister you should recognize all sisters. My 13y daughter was crying because her sister did not recognize her as her sister. My daughter went as far as to tell me that i will never see her again or any of my grandchildren because i took to defending my 13y daughters feelings.

Instead of talking to your oldest daughter, you made a passive-aggressive post on Facebook. How old are you?\n\nAlso, what's this part about moving to your oldest children's state to be more present in their lives, but then it \"fell apart\" so you went back home to your youngest two? I'm guessing this little chapter has something to do with your eldest's resentment.", "YTA - for trying to control both how your oldest daughters feel and what they post on social media.  It would have been fine to privately let them know the post hurt your younger daughter\u2019s feelings\u2026 but also, her post reflects her reality/feelings and it\u2019s your job to respect that. \n\nFrankly, I doubt 13 and 6 year olds are overly concerned about a single FB post anyways\u2026 the teenagers I know have long abandoned Facebook to the olds.  If you had not made this an issue, I doubt she would have even noticed or cared!\n\nPs. You have a lot of excuses for why you weren\u2019t there for your older three - but it sounds like the reality is you picked a relationship/your new kids over being close to and involved with your older children.  That (and the impact it had on your relationship) is on you - not the kids.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nYour daughter moved away with her dad when your teen daughter was a baby. She had no contact with the girl throughout her childhood. It's perfectly reasonable that she might not have strong sisterly feelings towards the girl.\n\nRelationships are complicated, yours are more complicated than average, and you went wading into the middle of them wearing steel-toed boots and started kicking people and dictating how they ought to feel.", "INFO: You said: \"Their dad kept all contact with me to nothing because of who i was dating.\"\n\nWho were you dating?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were an AH and caused drama, and your 13 year old daughter will have to live with the consequences of your assholery.", "YTA.\n\nThere's so, so much missing info here. \n\nYou were an absentee parent who prioritized your relationship over your kids, then you prioritized your younger kids over the older ones, and now you're trying to swoop in and play happy families?\n\nNope.", "YTA. As a step parent, I totally get that pit-in-your-gut feeling when one or more of your kids are left out of something, but you can\u2019t run with your knee jerk reaction. You blowing up (vs talking to someone directly) will always make you TA.\n\nBut here, it\u2019s more than that. You are just now repairing your relationship. As a parent, the repair falls mostly on you and your actions/reactions weigh heavily on your relationship. To think you could post a petty, backhanded comment that was obviously pointed towards your kid and not get blow back is\u2026 odd at best. You don\u2019t get to be like that and have your older kids in your life. And tbh, it may work with your younger kids, but only because they don\u2019t realize they have a choice to not put up with it.\n\nFurther, you are just now reconnecting. It\u2019s not weird for someone to not be comfortable listing their sibling in a siblings post when they had little to no interaction with that sibling. Because of how it impacts your 13f, you could reach out to your daughter and talk to her about it, to share how it made her sister feel, but you need to avoid trying to invalidate your older daughters feelings because doing that is only going to lose you your relationship with your kids. You won\u2019t even be able to blame their dad this time.", "YTA. It sounds to me like the reason your oldest daughters didn't have a relationship with your younger daughters is because you chose to continue to see someone who wasn't safe for your kids to be around.\n\nThey weren't raised together and your younger daughter is virtually a stranger to your oldest. Whereas she was raised with her full siblings and (it sounds like) this other girl. \n\nBlood doesn't make family, shared experiences do. And it sounds like your oldest doesn't really have any of those with your youngest daughters.", "Dude, you misinterpreted your oldest daughter\u2019s fb post about a non-holiday. For some reason you imagined that your oldest\u2019s appreciation for one of her sisters was a slight on her younger sister. You are aware that your daughter\u2019s relationship with one sister is not mutually exclusive with her other sisters? Especially given the fact that your older children spent a good deal of time apart from their younger siblings and are only just now beginning to develop a relationship with them. You can\u2019t expect their connection to be as close yet; you can\u2019t force that. Furthermore, how would the younger two daughters even know what older sis posted? 6 is far too young for fb and even 13 is a bit young too. So pretty much you saw a post on social media, misconstrued it to be an insult, and blew up at your daughter? Great way to start repairing your strained relationship. You also seem too immature for social media. Seriously, way to start a bunch of drama where there was none. YTA", "Yta for engaging in a passive aggressive social media pissing contest. If the post hurt your daughters feelings you should have picked up the phone and addressed it like an adult. There was no ill intent in the original post and literally everyone loses when you air dirty laundry online", "Info: why do you think bridging contact with them again means that they have to be invested in a sibling they we're not raised with? Like this feels like a contrived conflict where you're trying to tell them how they are supposed to feel and what their relationships are because you gave your 13-year-old expectations, when you have no right to demand emotional energy from them outside of what they agreed to.\n\n-YTA you keep dodging answering important questions because you just came here to get people to say that your daughters are villains. The 13-year-old was not victimized in any way, that is the only piece of relevant information to the situation. You went out to attack them because you are choosing to make drama, and it appears you already made that choice since you have been giving your 13-year-old an expectation that despite not having a sisterly relationship with these women, that she's allowed to feel victimized by them having a relationship.", "YTA. \n\n1) Don't police other people's relationships. The oldest are now adults and you can't force them to feel any particular way about their half sisters.\n\n\n2) You're on thin ice already- if you're intrusive, pushy and demanding you'll destroy these relationships. \n\n3) Sibling bonds  are built through time and shared experience, not DNA. Between you and your ex the girls had none of that-  you dipped out when they were 8 and 7 and have had a rocky time reestablishing a relationship.  They aren't going to feel any sibling bond with someone they didn't grow up with- that's wildly unrealistic.\n\n4) You're pushing a particularly self-serving narrative thinking that they should feel warmly toward the younger kids. Try to see it from their perspective - your second relationship and your second pair of daughters were all tied up in the breakup of their home and near total loss of their mom. That's brutally painful, not something to be celebrated.", "YTA\u2026good lord Facebook posts?! You are losing your daughters AGAIN over a Facebook post?! Also, your daughter is 13. Why does she even have a Facebook?! You are too old for that. It\u2019s embarrassing", "YTA - let me drop a bombshell for you\u2026.FB isn\u2019t real life.  It doesn\u2019t matter.  It is total make believe and utter bullshit.  Who cares what your daughter posted?  If you had an issue with it, as an adult, a parent,  you should have contacted her and had a conversation.  No need to post a response, reply or low key criticism on FB just to seek attention.  Cause let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s really the only reason you did it.  Ultimately I hope you are able to repair this minor blip and move on and build a relationship with all of your children.", "YTA\n\nLet your kids live their lives and stop trying to control them. You may be their mother biologically but it seems as though thats all you have with your eldest. Forcing relationships with their step siblings is gross. Especially when you still have so much more work to do in mending your relationship with your daughter.\n\nIf this is your way of \"repairing relationships\" (which, maybe consider why you need to be doing that in the first place) I wish you best of luck, because you've just flushed all the progress you've made down the toilet over a FB post.\n\n>My 13y daughter was crying because her sister did not recognize her as her sister.\n\nAnd just to be clear, you don't recognize that either - as you stated:\n\n>I raised my younger daughter (now 13) *who is their half sister*", "YTA many time over. You put your BF ahead of your children when they were 8 & 9. You gave up custody for your BF?? The fact that you are upset that your oldest made a Facebook post is ridiculous.  You should have been a better parent & your daughters would have had a better relationship. This is 100% on you. Your 13 yo would never have even seen it or known about it unless YOU told her about it. You made it a huge deal and made your 13 yo feel bad.", "I hope your righteousness was worth your relationship with your estranged children because that is what you lost here. There was a proper way to address your 13 year old\u2019s hurt feelings and making a backhanded Facebook post was not it. It was childish and immature. What did you expect to happen here? YTA, you should apologize.", "Yta", "You shouldn't have called her out in public. This was a private conversation. YTA", "Not only are you a deadbeat mother but you're an entitled deadbeat mother.

Not a good look.", "YTA. \n\nWhole bunch of missing missing reasons in your story.", "ESH I guess but it\u2019s more you than her. \n\nSo you saw a post from your daughter, and instead of talking to her like an adult, you made your own post about her so she\u2019d see it. People know she\u2019s your daughter and will know you\u2019re probably talking about her. It\u2019s Facebook\u2026 not real life. Honestly, it sucks that your teenager is hurt by this, but again\u2026 it\u2019s Facebook. \n\nYour oldest is probably mad at you because you made some passive aggressive post instead of just having a conversation. So she\u2019s distancing herself from drama. Sure, she could have listed the 13 year old, but based on what you said, she doesn\u2019t know her very well. I have cousins I\u2019ve never met, but have spoken to once or twice in 30 years. I don\u2019t list them when I\u2019m talking about my closer cousins because we really have no relationship. YTA for making passive aggressive posts and she\u2019s TA I guess for not mentioning her youngest sister.", "NTA. \n\nIts not wrong to let your oldest daughter how a post like that made your 13 year old feel. \n\n*However*, you do need to recognize that your eldest didn't grow up with your 13 year old. While she may feel some warmth towards her, she may not be a sister to her in the ways that matter to your oldest and you can't discredit that.

Should of been straight up and not beat around the bush.", "I was thinking the same, though reading between the lines, it sounds like OP either cheated on her ex and and married the affair partner or is dating/ married to a criminal (hence the \u201cwho I was with\u201d), is likely unemployed or barely employed (custody), an inattentive parent (years of low contact with the older children) and now, after making minimum efforts be decent to her older children so she can be a grandma (how fast they cut her out of their lives again), she feels entitled to tell her older kids what to do.\n\nNot sure if OP understands being a mother is a lifetime commitment and not an \u201cat your convenience\u201d task", "Yep. Either post is fake or there are missing missing reasons.", "You said it was FB. You\u2019re so full of shit.", "I THOUGH IT WAS ON FACEBOOK? NOW YOU ARE SAYING ANOTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM?? \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n Get your lies together \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "FB or Snapchat? You\u2019ve now said it was posted to both platforms. You\u2019re a straight up lying manipulator. You\u2019re a deadbeat mom who is getting into relationships with, what seems to be, dangerous men. You didn\u2019t have custody of half your kids and then went doting when you found out there was a grandchild. Their worlds do not revolve around you. Can we get \u201cAbusive Narcissistic Mother\u201d for 1000 Alex?", "No", "Are you reading to the same thread as everyone else?", "they are. i see them all the time. changing their age to 18 so fb will allow them.", "I don't know any 13 year old that would even admit to having a FB now. That's social media for their grandparents. They've all migrated to other sites like tiktok and social media sites that I don't even know about because I'm too old.", "come to think of it. i even find small ones on tiktok and fb. i find that very irresponsible of their parents tho. \n\nsource: my fb feed filled with teenage parents of little ones gyrating on tiktok", "YTA first here it sounds like you picked a man over you kids. That\u2019s interesting. Then you expect the older ones to just  fake a relationship with the younger ones that they don\u2019t really know, do they? You don\u2019t get to force that. And then to top it off you bring all this drama to FB\u2026 so back to the first question, how did you lose visitation of the older kids?", "YTA, you're hardly in a position to tell her what family counts and what doesn't. You barely know her (reasons are fairly irrelevant, you had children that you had little to no contact with during their formative years) and are just getting on decent terms with her.", "YTA. Why did you feel the need to publicly call her out in social media?", "My husband has 1 half sibling and 5 steps. His parents divorced when he was in college and remarried when he was no longer living at home. He barely knows his half or step siblings, he's met them like 4 times, and he certainly doesn't consider any of them to be his siblings.", "It sounded like a bunch of schools kids fighting at recess.  Good grief, YTA.", "I'm pretty sure OP directly told her youngest daughters \"oldest daughter doesn't consider you her sister because she hates you.\" That just seems like the kind of drama lover op is.", "She says the ex got full custody because of who she was dating, and an attempt at custody transfer failed, presumably for the same reason. That\u2019s not affair partner territory, that\u2019s convicted sex offender territory.", "I mean ....it says straight in the post it was because of who you were dating. So which is it?", "No that's not how it works. If she doesn't recognize a 13yo that she's never lived with or had much to do with and who doesn't share the same dad, that's nothing to do with you. YTA Plus YTA for letting your kids go away and not have any custody.", ">They are sisters by the bonds they made\n\nYeah. The bonds they made growing up and being raised together. Your youngest daughters have met your oldest daughters maybe a dozen times? That is not enough to form a sisterly bond.", "Here it is: they\u2019re half sisters who didn\u2019t meet consistently until a few years ago.\n\nYour youngest girls might be YOURS but for your older girls, they are strangers.\n\nYou didn\u2019t care enough for 13 years and now instead of being a grown up, you make a passive aggressive fb post \ud83e\udd23\n\nNo wonder they didn\u2019t wanna have a relationship with you", "This is a woman who dated some guy bad enough that her ex got sole custody of her kids. Judgement and actual caring for her kids don\u2019t exist here.", "Yta", "This, so much. \"Oh I see something that offended me! Instead of talking about it to the people involved, I will just make semi hidden snide remarks on social media!\"\n\nWhy on earth would someone think that oh that will fix the problem!\n\nOP, definitely YTA"]}
