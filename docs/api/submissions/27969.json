Did I read this correctly? You guys go bowling and you watch him bowl but he disappears when you bowl? What kind of date is that? It's like going out to dinner but sitting at separate tables.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would be pretty annoyed if my date clearly did not give a rat's posterior about my playing or my score. The kicker is when you said he was more interested in OTHER PEOPLE's scores - like complete strangers? - than his fianc\u00e9's. That's just plain rude, even if you two weren't engaged.\n\nDoes he do this in other areas? Like if you talk about books or movies or hobbies, does he expect you to cheerlead for his preferences while ignoring yours?\n\nNo, it's not a deal-breaker at this point, but I'd watch for him being dismissive in other areas. Edit: Is this guy going to have your back when you're sick?", "NTA. its a given that you would get upset. if you are paying him that attention then you would hope that he does the same to you. next time, try not paying any attention when he is playing and then see how he reacts. if he does react badly or points out that you arent paying attention, then inform him that you had felt the exact same way too.", "NTA\n\nI wouldnt say your fiance is asshole either, but he probably should've payed more attention to the person he going on a date with, especially if you're engaged", "NTA; ignore the comments implying you're selfish/needy. It's a bowling date; if he's not interacting with you on your turns, what's the point and where's the fun? You're supposed to smack talk, tease each other, celebrate strikes/spares, etc. \n\nIs he like this in any other aspect of your relationship that you can think of? \n\nI'd consider this a yellow flag in your position; maybe he was just having an off night, but he ruined your date and doesn't appear to care.", "NTA. I doubt if this is the only instance where he cares so little about supporting/ celebrating with you and thinks only of himself. What a lousy date experience. It may seem like a small thing to you, but think really hard about other aspects of your relationship and be sure this is someone you want to be married to.", "YTA\nYou have got to be kidding!!

Is your bowling style and skill really all that interesting that you expect him to sit and stare at you while you bowl?

Sounds like he has ADD. Maybe be less of a \u201cme me me\u201d as you falsely accuse him of.

I\u2019ve had a few relationships with people-pleasers who never ask for attention, so they find it wrong for me to ask anything of them and somehow make it my fault for being \u201cselfish.\u201d All that is to say, this unfortunately happens often. \n\nNTA - try to explain that the point of the date is to feel like you\u2019re in the moment together, not just that you happen to be there at the same time. If you frame it as positive (\u201cI really want to have quality time with you\u201d) rather than a criticism (\u201cit was rude of you to ignore me\u201d), it\u2019ll likely go over better.", "NAH just because someone doesn\u2019t give you attention at the times you would give them attention doesn\u2019t make them wrong", "NTA. Wow, one of the reasons for a bowling date is to get to openly stare at and admire your date's (or fianc\u00e9's) backside. I can't imagine missing the opportunity. I mean the scoring is secondary isn't it?", "I don't think he disappears, actually, disappears.", "The things he is doing aren't really long things though. Glancing over at another lane's scores doesn't mean that he isn't watching her shot. Neither is grabbing a different ball to try on your next turn. If he is still watching her while he is doing this stuff I don't see an issue. \n\n>The kicker is when you said he was more interested in OTHER PEOPLE's scores - like complete strangers? - than his fianc\u00e9's. That's just plain rude, even if you two weren't engaged.\n\nKicker? You act like he's cheating on her. If its a close game on the adjacent lane or someone is streaking 5 strikes in a row then a glance that way isn't a big deal. \n\nLook at the way OP describes her behaviour:\n\n>and probably wouldn\u2019t have seen any of it had I not prompted him.\n\nSo she kept telling him every shot \"hey. hey. hey, are you watching? are you watching? watch my shot!\"\n\nThat gets annoying very quickly. I can tell you that even if I was watching her shots before, that sort of behaviour would turn me off from watching her shots. \n\n> Edit: Is this guy going to have your back when you're sick?\n\nReally? I admire how good this subreddit is at taking something so utterly inconsequential and turning it into a massive issue. Talk about overdramatisation.", "Wild to use the formating to imply that you were direclty quoting her and then completely misrepresent what she said.", "It's completely normal to expect the person you're out on a date with pay you attention.

OP has described a couple hours of behavior in four years of a relationship in a four year relationship and you\u2019re accusing them of \u201chooking up with someone with competitive narcissistic traits\u201d?  Are you, ok?  Seriously, are you?  It doesn\u2019t not sound like you are ok.", "If the mods are reading this, please ban pyschotherapy jargon.

If you're going on a date with just your partner, as opposed to hanging out with a bunch of friends, it's reasonable to expect that your date shows at least some interest in you.\n\nOr if, as you suggest, there is a close game or multiple strikes in the next lane, point that out to your partner so you can both enjoy the action.", "If you read the post, then look at the text in the quote block and come to the conclusion that OP actually said that word for word then the problem is you.

Can you be any more of an AITA stereotype?", "I'll agree with you on the first line. We only have her story and I really think that there could be more to it. \n\nYour interpretation is possible. I want to ask OP if he was actually facing away and not watching her at all or if he was just glancing over at other things and still paying 90% attention to her shots (rather than the 100% OP seems to expect?).\n\nI'll admit my first reply was a bit heated so I'll apologise for that.
