You weren't rude because she loves her boys, you were rude because she insulted your daughter. IN FRONT OF HER!\n\nAnd you're right. Boys aren't easier. Gender. Is. Irrelevant. Children are individuals.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister is projecting. If she had 3 kids on purpose, she 100% wanted a girl and just never got one. So, now that she\u2019s done having kids, she\u2019s using her anti-girl rhetoric and boymom perspective as a coping strategy. \n\nThat\u2019s just a guess, though.

They waited for merch, they had a great time, and much like your daughter, my own talked about it for WEEKS afterwards.\n\nHe's since taken her to Billie Eilish as well, and while he isn't super into either he, like you, enjoyed seeing her have such a great time getting to see an act she loved in person.\n\nAnd while it's certainly different parenting a boy vs parenting a girl, your sister is an enormous AH for shitting all over this great experience you had with your daughter right in front of you.\n\nYou sound like a good dad, to be honest.  What your mom and sister think of that is irrelevant.    It's too bad your sister needs to justify her own insecurities by belittling your relationship with your kid.", "NTA.

Your sister's words were hurtful and insulting to your daughter, not to mention - as she is someone who hasn't raised girls she really has **no idea** how they compare. And as you note, comparing is pretty dumb anyway because of the huge variety of experiences of parenting different individuals. Your sister 'just loving her boys' doesn't have to make her disparage and demean girls or specifically your daughter. It was good that you brought her attention to the fact that her whole personality is that she has three boys, and the toxicity that has added to the way she treats others.", "NTA.  You're a great dad.  I can't help but think your sister is actually a little jealous.  Though you really should consider having your daughter have limited contact with your sister.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. I can\u2019t believe your sister lacked the awareness to make those statements, but more importantly MAKE THEM IN FRONT OF YOUR DAUGHTER. Your sister is really not a  great female role model for your daughter.", "NTA and thank you for calling her out. I\u2019m so tired of people constantly complaining about having daughters. It\u2019s so vile the way some people talk about young girls.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure raising boys and girls each come with their challenges, and every kid is different anyway.

There is a difference between talking about how much you love your sons, and straightup insulting your daughter. She did the latter. \n\n(And you are also right that she is also being toxic and has no idea what she is talking about., but if you even want to take a truly gendered approach - boys get into WAY more trouble w/ fighting/violence/throwing themselves out of trees or rooftops, wreckless driving, etc BUT your daughter wasn't even doing some dumb \\*girl\\* thing anyways). Your sister may just be jealous that she doesn't have a daughter, and that your daughter was choosing to spend time with her grandmother over her aunt.  Why else would she need to be a #boymom so hard?", " NTA- just wait till her \u201cboys\u201d get married, my guess is new DIL\u2019s will be posting in the various bad/crazy MIL sub\u2019s", "NTA so your mom can defend your sister by saying \u201cshe just loves her boys\u201d, but when you defend yourself for loving your daughter, and everything you do for her, you\u2019re now TA??

You\u2019re an amazing father and your daughter should be lucky to have you!", "NTA. She started it, although you could have toned down your response which focused not on her basic rudeness to you and your daughter but on the sex of her children again. \n\nI might be wrong, but it sounds as though she's masking a bit of disappointment and is perhaps a bit envious of you regarding having a daughter. Otherwise why keep bringing it up? \n\nLet her know that your daughter felt hurt by her comments and that you're as proud of her as she is of her boys. And that you won't be accepting any criticisms of her based on the fact she's a girl. Would she accept criticism for being a woman, not a man?", "NTA but if you have the bandwidth, maybe let your nephews know you're a safe person to come to if they need help? Especially emotionally.

Not your fault your sister really wanted a girl and is overcompensating.", "Nta. Your sister is completely wrong and does need a new personality", "NTA.

Usually I take alot of stock when a 3rd party (your mom) chooses the side of not OP.

Funnily enough, I have 2 grown-up boys and my friend, who was staying at the weekend, has 3 grownup girls. I love being a mum of boys and she loves being a mum of girls and we couldn't imagine it any other way. In reality, we agreed, you couldn't love your children any more than you do and most parents think that whatever they have is the best combination! Each have their own challenges and advantages. \nYour sister may be overcompensating cos she would have liked a daughter? You probably could have handled a little better but it's probably a real pain listening to her constantly implying that boys are better than girls (when we all know, girls are the best! \ud83d\ude01), not to mention, pretty boring!", "NTA!
