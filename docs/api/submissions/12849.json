Children are individuals.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister is projecting. If she had 3 kids on purpose, she 100% wanted a girl and just never got one. So, now that she\u2019s done having kids, she\u2019s using her anti-girl rhetoric and boymom perspective as a coping strategy. \n\nThat\u2019s just a guess, though.

They waited for merch, they had a great time, and much like your daughter, my own talked about it for WEEKS afterwards.\n\nHe's since taken her to Billie Eilish as well, and while he isn't super into either he, like you, enjoyed seeing her have such a great time getting to see an act she loved in person.\n\nAnd while it's certainly different parenting a boy vs parenting a girl, your sister is an enormous AH for shitting all over this great experience you had with your daughter right in front of you.\n\nYou sound like a good dad, to be honest.  What your mom and sister think of that is irrelevant.    It's too bad your sister needs to justify her own insecurities by belittling your relationship with your kid.", "NTA.

Your sister's words were hurtful and insulting to your daughter, not to mention - as she is someone who hasn't raised girls she really has **no idea** how they compare. And as you note, comparing is pretty dumb anyway because of the huge variety of experiences of parenting different individuals. Your sister 'just loving her boys' doesn't have to make her disparage and demean girls or specifically your daughter. It was good that you brought her attention to the fact that her whole personality is that she has three boys, and the toxicity that has added to the way she treats others.", "NTA.  You're a great dad.  I can't help but think your sister is actually a little jealous.  Though you really should consider having your daughter have limited contact with your sister.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. I can\u2019t believe your sister lacked the awareness to make those statements, but more importantly MAKE THEM IN FRONT OF YOUR DAUGHTER. Your sister is really not a  great female role model for your daughter.", "NTA and thank you for calling her out. I\u2019m so tired of people constantly complaining about having daughters. It\u2019s so vile the way some people talk about young girls.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure raising boys and girls each come with their challenges, and every kid is different anyway.

There is a difference between talking about how much you love your sons, and straightup insulting your daughter. She did the latter. \n\n(And you are also right that she is also being toxic and has no idea what she is talking about., but if you even want to take a truly gendered approach - boys get into WAY more trouble w/ fighting/violence/throwing themselves out of trees or rooftops, wreckless driving, etc BUT your daughter wasn't even doing some dumb \\*girl\\* thing anyways). Your sister may just be jealous that she doesn't have a daughter, and that your daughter was choosing to spend time with her grandmother over her aunt.  Why else would she need to be a #boymom so hard?", " NTA- just wait till her \u201cboys\u201d get married, my guess is new DIL\u2019s will be posting in the various bad/crazy MIL sub\u2019s", "NTA so your mom can defend your sister by saying \u201cshe just loves her boys\u201d, but when you defend yourself for loving your daughter, and everything you do for her, you\u2019re now TA??

You\u2019re an amazing father and your daughter should be lucky to have you!", "NTA. She started it, although you could have toned down your response which focused not on her basic rudeness to you and your daughter but on the sex of her children again. \n\nI might be wrong, but it sounds as though she's masking a bit of disappointment and is perhaps a bit envious of you regarding having a daughter. Otherwise why keep bringing it up? \n\nLet her know that your daughter felt hurt by her comments and that you're as proud of her as she is of her boys. And that you won't be accepting any criticisms of her based on the fact she's a girl. Would she accept criticism for being a woman, not a man?", "NTA but if you have the bandwidth, maybe let your nephews know you're a safe person to come to if they need help? Especially emotionally.

Not your fault your sister really wanted a girl and is overcompensating.", "Nta. Your sister is completely wrong and does need a new personality", "NTA.

Usually I take alot of stock when a 3rd party (your mom) chooses the side of not OP.

Funnily enough, I have 2 grown-up boys and my friend, who was staying at the weekend, has 3 grownup girls. I love being a mum of boys and she loves being a mum of girls and we couldn't imagine it any other way. In reality, we agreed, you couldn't love your children any more than you do and most parents think that whatever they have is the best combination! Each have their own challenges and advantages. \nYour sister may be overcompensating cos she would have liked a daughter? You probably could have handled a little better but it's probably a real pain listening to her constantly implying that boys are better than girls (when we all know, girls are the best! \ud83d\ude01), not to mention, pretty boring!", "NTA!

It is also clearly damaging to the boys as they now hear their mother describe them as \u201ceasy\u201d and girls/women as \u201cdifficult.\u201d How awful for them! She is raising them to be misogynists. \n\nGreat job standing up for your daughter and being a good dad! If it were me, I would have a talk with sister and set a very clear boundary that is enforced. With the mom too, if it becomes necessary. Your little girl will thank you. \n\nNTA.", "I remember getting told how difficult having a teenage daughter is going to specifically because I'm a single dad and her mom isn't around... Overall though she's a good kid so I don't think that'll happen \n\nI just ignore her when she goes on about boys being easier to raise than girls but she was talking about my daughter while she was right there just excitedly talking about the concert", "I have both and neither were better or worse than the other. They both present different challenges, but nothing I would go \"Ugh next time I'm having only boys/girls\"", "My daughter first concert was a coldplay concert when she was 10, I remember us both having a lot of fun... She talks about it whenever coldplay comes on \n\nEven though like I said I'm not a Taylor swift to fan I don't think I will forget the concert just based on seeing how happy my daughter was during the whole day", "Who did he put down? How do you get \u201cpetty\u201d from this Dad\u2019s story?", "Exactly. OP is being a hypocrite about his sister saying raising boys is easier insinuating raising a girl is easier. She doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to raise a girl and he doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to raise a boy. It\u2019s not a damn competition which gender is easier.", "How was OP rude?", "God forbid an adult gets called stupid. The child half her age should\u2019ve taken being called a burden  to her face with grace. So glad that sister is boy mom, girls sure do suck.", "She was personally attacking my daughter just because she's a girl... It isn't a parenting competition when I'm defending my daughter who was just excited to talk about a concert she went to", "She can hold whatever stupid opinions she wants. \n\nWhat she can\u2019t do is express those stupid opinions in a way and at a time that is clearly upsetting to OPs daughter.", "Nah, someone insults my kid to their face and spewing misogynistic bullshit is going to hear *my* opinion. \n\nHaving a shit opinion doesn't make you immune to others calling you out about it. Especially making fun of an excited, happy 15 year old girl.", "I actually said 'aww!' out loud when I read your paragraph about how much of a blast it was seeing your kid having fun, that's good dad'ing right there", "I think mom's who say this shit are really just saying \"I think boys require less care and attention, therefore, I'm going to be less of an involved/concerned parent\". Like, they're not *easier*, you just decided that you get to check out because your kid has a dick.", "I had this hilarious idea that having a boy would equal less clothing drama. Then I ended up with an amazing boy who changes outfits 3 times a day! He want khakis with a button-down and an effing TIE before putting on sweats and a t-shirt to shoot hoops. Since the age of 5.", "She's hit the point at which it really doesn't much matter whether she hates girls or is just saying that to deflect. Either way, she is saying hateful misogynist things about girls and she is directly hurting her niece by saying that shit.", "Or she hates boys, and she's trying to tell herself that \"hey, at least it could be worse\"?", "I thought this too.", "I've been to a decent amount of concerts with my mother over the years, whether it was her looking after me while I saw someone I wanted back when I was a child, or us enjoying a concert together when I've grown older. Obviously she's also gone to many concerts over the years with my father or her friends etc.\n\nShe maintains that the hardest concert she has ever had to sit through was Jones Brothers. And not because of the Brothers themselves because she actually liked them.\n\nIt was the sheet volume coming from the tween girl audience because this was 2009 and Camp Rock was EVERYWHERE. We literally had Demi Lovato as the OPENING act.\n\nThat audience was insane; it sounded like half the room were screaming their lungs out for the entire show.", "My dad took me to see the Jonas Brothers as a kid. It was my first concert. He even did the BlackBerry text thing to get a message about me liking Joe Jonas on the big screen.", "Me too! For several hours after the concert, I sounded like I sucked on helium the whole time. I didn't even know that was a thing!", "Obviously only artists with larger female fan bases have long merch lines. Boys never want merch. It has to do with chromosomes. /s", "Right? My husband has two buddies who are super into Taylor Swift. One is single; one is married with a young daughter. Gender, age, none of it has anything to do with what you like. That's just stupid.", "Yes! I immediately thought of how long the merch line at the last big pro wrestling show I went to was!", "Lots of people think boys are easier to raise just because they only bother to parent girls, and do nothing with their boys", "This is what I was thinking.  People who promote this worldview about raising daughters are just being callous about the dangers women face, especially while growing up.  They don't feel an equal burden to raise their sons responsibly, because they think they can duck out of the problem of misogyny the same way trashy men do.", "Yep. My oldest 2 are boys and I can\u2019t count how many times I was told it would be so much easier than girls.", "Frankly, my response to your sister would be \u201cI\u2019m glad that parenting your boys has been easy for you. I didn\u2019t become a parent because I wanted something \u2018easy\u2019. My child, boy or girl, was always going to be worth whatever effort it took.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "   I think your sister wanted a girl but didn't get one.\nI think your daughter talking about going to the Taylor swift concert made your sister bitter and jealous and she said that nonsense to make herself feel better. \n I bet your sister would love to go to a Taylor swift concert. That doesn't excuse what she said ... Nta", "Mine too", "100% Agreed. I never have a single thought to a preference of gender, just wanted a big happy (non abusive) family that I didn\u2019t have growing up. Maybe it\u2019s a perspective thing?", "Wow. How did Christmas go? You are the best dad!", "Yep, lol!", "Ugh. You\u2019re probably right. I hate that.", "See? That's perfect.", "He put down his sister by calling her stupid and toxic, it's petty because that's not really what he was upset about. He was upset that his daughter felt bad, not that his sister is obsessed with her boys but her reaction to her niece sharing a fun experience she had. I don't think he meant to be an AH but he did want to hurt his sister because his daughter was hurt and that's petty.", ">And that she's toxic and honestly stupid for thinking raising boys is easier then raising girls. I told her she needs to find a new personality outside of being a boy mom.", "What did your sister say that was a personal attack on your daughter? Did she say \"you're toxic and stupid\" like you did? \n\n--->Telling your sister to keep her opinions about girl/boy parenting to herself is what you should have done long ago. In private, in a serious discussion.", "Yes she can. We can\u2019t shield our kids from people who don\u2019t share the same happy feelings as them. All we can do is teach them how to recognize it and not let them bring down their own happiness. These are the best lessons for our kids to learn but also some of the hardest.", "I agree. The old-fashioned thought was that boys were less work because they didn't get pregnant.", "'boys are easier to raise' translates to 'his gf will do the rest of his parenting later'", "Out of curiosity, which city did you see them in? And was it during the first or 2nd album release?", "Oh my god THIS. Anyone who thinks boys are \u2018easier\u2019 to raise is dropping the ball massively.", "Then they would hear thats its damaging to young girls that parents dont care about their boys.", "I honestly don't understand it.  Raising my son is one of the hardest things I've done (doing). I love him.  But it's like trying to tame a tasmanian devil.", "My friend has 2 boys and spends every weekend at a high school.sports game or band concert. She also travels out of state for pro sports games and has to queue for fan gear. This example is regrettably very gendered (boy=sports, girl=TS), but it is a true story for my friend lol. OP's sister just doesn't do things with her kids and calls it easy... Not saying you need to do big and expensive things with your kids, but even without the pro sports trips, my friend still devotes a lot of time to her kids' extracurriculars.", "Ok, I see your point. I guess where we disagree is I think it\u2019s perfectly ok to tell people they\u2019re stupid and toxic when that\u2019s what they\u2019re being. Yeah, the high road is always the better choice, but I think your judgement - equating his behavior with his sisters is wrong. He didn\u2019t start it, he shouldn\u2019t be held to the same standard. If we had to live by your rules all us nice folks wouldn\u2019t be allowed to stand up for ourselves or our daughters and the stupid/toxic people would never shut up. There is nuance in every interaction, do you always assume if two people are yelling at each other that they\u2019re both equally wrong?", "I mean, the woman just tore down teenage girls in front of his teenage girls. She was being pretty toxic and stupid. Calling people out for being rude doesn't somehow make you rude.", "That wasn\u2019t rude, it was true. It is toxic and a not well thought out attitude.", "Idk. Is it rude if it's true?", "By telling me she feels bad for me having to raise a girl in front of my daughter.... That's basically telling my daughter you're a piece of work just based on your gender alone", "Maybe with the outside world. But your aunt saying you\u2019re hard work and dreadful because you\u2019re a girl - that\u2019s pretty piss poor.", "So the daughter should just put up with her aunt insulting her?", "Not comfy saying the city, but it was the No Strings Attached tour", "He could have said she was being rude. What he was doing was labeling her, instead of calling out her behavior or words, which is both toxic and pointless. He clearly was bottling these feelings up and exploded in an inappropriate way that was completely counterproductive to his purpose.\n\nAnd telling someone to find a new personality is just awful, even if it is true. The truth doesnt save you from being an asshole.", ">That wasn\u2019t rude, it was true\n\nAh yes. The defense of every asshole ever. Ill let the dude take it from here\n\n*\"You're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole\"*", "This is the defense of every asshole ever.", "What? Yes? One doesn't invalidate the other?\n\nEdit: for those downvoting, any explanation on how something being true cancels out it being rude?", "Absolutely.  I\u2019m glad you stood up for her.", "No worries, I went after the first album dropped in Chicago. Well, technically Rosemont just outside of Chicago.", ">even went as far as to say she feels bad for me having to be a girl dad\n\nThis chick was going HARD at his child. She deserved everything she got, and more. He was just defending his freaking kid.", "Backing up arguments with outdated movie quotes isn\u2019t going to be bolster your position. Do a little research on the psychology behind the whole boy mom identity/lifestyle. It is toxic, and anti female.", "Why is rude, though? He didn't yell. He just said. Explain why it's rude.", "Well sure you can be an asshole if someone says something that hurts your child's feelings.", "You keep arguing as if my point is that he was incorrect, despite me saying it was not, and then telling me to do research. \n\nClearly I am in the pocket of BigMom.", "So say you've got a big nose. Should I just say, \"hey big nose!\" Every time I see you? It's TRUE! Orrrr, can we say that it's not polite [i.e. rude] to say what we think, when we feel it, with little awareness to the time or place? Come on dude.", "Yes, you absolutely can be an asshole if they are deliberately hurting your child\u2019s feelings like sister was doing.  Sister was deliberately putting his daughter down, he called her on it and she threw a tantrum. Sister acted like a far bigger child than the actual child in this situation.", "My apologies if I misunderstood your position.", ">Yes, you absolutely can be an asshole\n\nAgreed."]}
