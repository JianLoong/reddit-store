NTA", "NTA: just because previous generations suffered postpartum because\u2026 we\u2019re FaMiLY.. doesn\u2019t mean you have to. Immediate postpartum is whatever the mother needs it to be, I needed privacy and calm initially and didn\u2019t want people over holding my child and breaking my routines. One week is not a huge ask.

That's more than reasonable. You're not depriving your mom of seeing the baby for months and months you're asking for a couple of days. It should be more acceptable to allow new moms time to recover and families time to welcome their baby home without feeling pressure to have additional people around.  It's not their baby.", "NTA  Tell her that she claims you are denying her the joys of grand parenthood yet she is trying to deprive you and your wife the joys of parenthood. Tell father and sister that if everyone continues to try to cross your boundaries concerning your child that they'll all be denied time with your child. You have to set strict boundaries from the beginning and stick to them or they'll be continually crossed.", "NTA. No way! You are doing exactly what your wife needs you to do. Maintain those boundaries", "Nta but you should have addressed this way before the birth, not days before.", "NTA- let the dog go to puppy day care as required. The only visitors allowed are those who are approved by the person giving birth.", "NTA. \n\nMy nephew was almost a month before I met him the first time.

Wife is healing, and you're both trying to learn to care for a tiny person. It's exhausting. Having people around immediately after is even more tiring. Also, you're not denying anyone the ability to visit or bond with your child after the first week. If they can't understand that you just want some time to yourselves to adjust, then get a friend to watch the dog. Don't tell anyone when you go to the hospital or until you're ready to have visitors. They can't do or say much then. \n\nI did this with my firstborn, and let me tell you, it was exactly what I needed. When I phoned people and explained that the baby was already a week old and we had needed the time to process what ended up being a very overwhelming thing and bond with our son, they mostly understood. Only my mother got upset. It did her no favors, though, when everyone else found out. They yelled at her for yelling at me for wanting time to adjust and bond.", "NTA, I can\u2019t wait to be a grandma, but when that happens, I\u2019ll wait to be told what my children/partners need from me in terms of visiting/support etc.. demanding visitation immediately after the birth is hugely selfish.", "NTA holy shit, we initially told people 6 weeks, and cut it shorter when we felt comfortable.\n\nA week is absolutely not too much to ask, she\u2019s overreacting, and acting way too entitled.

This time around (approaching shortly!) I've just resigned myself to the fact that we'll need the support if my MIL in order to look after my older son.

When I had my first, my plan was to have a week at home with no visitors, although I didn't make any kind of announcement about it; but then I ended up in hospital for nearly that entire first week, and you know what? I was really lonely, even with my partner there. So I ended up having our families pop in once a day, and it was lovely, it gave me a moment to breathe, and helped in cultivating the relationships they have with my kids now.\n\nI think too much in the way of rules, whether that's a rule to stay away or a rule that they have to be there every day at the same time, flies in the face of the reality for most families. That doesn't mean don't do what you want, but it does mean that maybe you should consider that a little flexibility will give you greater benefits in the long-term.", "YTA - it's fine to not want visitors, but when someone is helping you out with life around a birth in a way where a visit could be expected (in this case dropping off the dog) you should be upfront if that visiting isn't going to happen.\n\nIt can make people feel like they were tricked, even if they would have done it anyway.\n\nIn general, I think it's best to tell close (supportive) family ahead of time as well.", "NTA.

It\u2019s important to them and they are hurt and disappointed.", "I think it's FOMO that three other grandparents will hold the baby first.", "Gotta get to the kid before that new baby smell wears off, I guess.", "Disagree, so because she watched a dog she's entitled to see her grandchild? Absolutely not. Give her 50$ and be done \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Who said anything about a right? I said it would have been good to have that discussions weeks or months before.", "It seems selfish that\u2019s what.  They need her help but don\u2019t have to consider her?  . Relationships are reciprocal with care being given to each party.   Anything less and you are the ass.", "Not in one week they don't. And their hurt and disappointment is theirs to manage, it's not on the new parents who are dealing with recovery from birth and a newborn. NTA", "Same, I felt awkward reading all those NTA.. maybe it's a cultural thing? I believe some countries have weird family dynamics..I can't even imagine a MIL not seeing the newborn grandchild in the immediate days after the birth, unless there were problems with the delivery and the child was to stay in the hospital etc..OP's mother didn't even want to be there for much time and just wished to take a look and greet the newborn while bringing back OP's dog, in fact doing them another favour since the OP could avoid leaving the home settling (???) he values so much, but they won't even let her be there for 10 minutes. I don't question the fact that it is your choice in the end but it's your mother OP, not the nosy neighbour..I can't understand the cold shoulder and can perfectly see how she must be hurt by your decision.", "Gen X here- it\u2019s called boundaries. Just because other generations are finally establishing them, it doesn\u2019t mean no one else does. No way in hell I wanted people over that first week.", "Sometimes they don\u2019t live a whole week, unfortunately.", "You just said if you had a kid. So clearly you don\u2019t know. Why are you here just talking to hear yourself?", "I became one.  I respect my kids.  What they want for their kids is what I\u2019m gonna support.  Being a grandma is special. But doesn\u2019t come with special privileges.", "No, it's not, in most cases. It's about being excited that there is a new member in the family and wanting to see what the baby looks like and experience the joy of a new life. The idea that most people think the way you say here, is absurd.Grandparents have been excited and wanted to meet the baby asap long before social media was ever invented. Having said that, OP is NTA. It's their baby and their decision. As someone who has worked with newborns for many years, most people want to have short visits with family right away to share joy, and it is really lovely for the most part.", "[deleted]", "So if I watched your dogs because you asked that means I\u2019m allowed to come to your house and do whatever I want and make you do whatever I want now because I did you a favor? Because that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re saying. That grandma has a right to do what she wants because dad asked her to watch the dogs while his wife gave birth?", "This sounds like a decision that was made by the wife quite a while ago, perhaps because the MIL is too intrusive, but the husband just brought up with his mom now. He was probably supposed to tell her before but put it off because he didn\u2019t want to have this exact same scenario. \n\nI still say NTA. I can\u2019t stand my in-laws and based on my SIL\u2019s experience, we didn\u2019t even tell anyone when we had the baby. They didn\u2019t see him right away and that was fine and we never had a conversation about it - it was just the way it was.", "Yeah, mansplain my western family dynamic to me, buddy. Surely you will be right, since you are a guy from Saudi Arabia.", "Then that would make the parents AHs, not OP.\n\nYou don't get to ignore someone's privacy just because you're sad.", "? I\u2019m talking bc it was posted as a question?", "I would add that babies change very quickly in those first weeks. So really from day 1 to day 7, baby already looks a bit different. There is something special about those first few days.", "And you'd be in trouble for getting rid of a dog that doesn't belong to you? Use your brain mate, I'm pretty sure she only watched the dog while the wife was in labour but they'd Def be better off paying an actual dog sitter/puppy daycare than some entitled grandma \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f just bc you watch my dog doesn't mean at all that I have to let you see my child, they don't EVEN equate.", "That\u2019s not what they are saying.", "Ok but I can only reason on what's written, anything else is assumptions, OP didn't say anything about a bad family relationship or the mother being too intrusive.", "Bless your heart. You sound awful.", "No matter how you try to spin it, grandma does not have a right to see the baby whenever she wants just because she watched the dog.", "Then what are they saying? Are they saying that the parents don\u2019t have a right to want a singular week alone to try to adjust a little to have a new baby? Are they saying the grandma has a right to see the baby whenever she wants no matter what the baby\u2019s parents want?", "True, but I notice that sometimes people leave context out that\u2019s important to their story. And when you ask or mention it, the OP will respond. \n\nIt may be cultural that the grandparents see the baby right away. I live in the states, and it\u2019s pretty much 50/50 from what I\u2019ve seen. Some have family there right away and some like to have a week or two with just each other and the baby. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine having to entertain people after just giving birth. That seems like a lot.", "Easier to keep the dog away from slobbering on the child than an entitled adult.", "I\u2019m starting to wonder if everyone on these threads just hate their parents. I was so excited to show my parents my children after birth. I would never of kept them from that exciting time with me, they never stayed long maybe 10-15 mins but it was so nice and everyone was so excited together. I would of been annoyed if they didn\u2019t want to meet my babies. So ya you win grandma doesn\u2019t have the right, but why wouldn\u2019t you want her there? Especially knowing how excited she is? Do your parents feelings really mean nothing now?", "Well, if that\u2019s the case, I guess she forfeited that right when her son picked up the dog.", "In my country it's common for direct family (parents and some siblings of the couple) to greet the newborn in hospital, I would dare say it's good manners. Of course the couple doesn't have to do anything like entertain, once home usually the grandmother helps in the house and cleans, cooks etc so that the new mother can take care of the child and rest.. that's why it sounds so weird to me that OP's mother is not even allowed in the house. Their choice oc but I feel for her \ud83d\ude48", "Does the actual new parents feelings really mean nothing now ? They want some time alone to adjust to being new parents. They don\u2019t have to hate their parents to just want some time alone with their baby. You\u2019re wild. I\u2019m so happy for that your experience with birth made you want to see your parents and everyone else. But some people also actually care about keeping their baby safe and healthy and away from extra germs for a little while. It\u2019s literally a week. They can wait that long.", "Ya I guess I\u2019m lucky \u263a\ufe0f and so is my family.", "It\u2019s almost like your experience isn\u2019t everyone else\u2019s. Maybe you should learn that.", "Please don't start thinking the Reddit experience is the norm :) You're absolutely right."]}
