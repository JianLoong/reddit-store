He lives in Arizona and we live in Illinois. He was using some sort of feature where you can see girls in other states. He stated he was considering moving here. He has visited once before and they met and hung out for two days. I met him a total of ten minutes. \n\nLast Sunday she comes into the living room and tells me she is picking up her \u201cboyfriend\u201d from the airport and he would be staying with us. 24 hours prior she told me that he mysteriously slept through his first flight and she was going to be single forever. While confused as to her now addressing him as a boyfriend I had already told her before I didn\u2019t mind if he crashed at our place for a few days despite not really knowing him. I again told her it was fine. Just wanted her to be happy. She then gets really awkward and starts to tell me he\u2019s not sure how long he\u2019ll be staying. I questioned it for a bit as she continued to be hesitant about answering how long he would be here. The only thing she said is \u201che wouldn\u2019t be living with us\u201d. He didn\u2019t have a flight home. At this point I very calmly said I honestly wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with him just staying with us indefinitely and that she should consider my feelings as I live there. Mind you I\u2019ve known this girl for ten years and she\u2019s a best friend of mine. The conversation went on but for brevity\u2019s sake she eventually storms out and says that she better not see a girl I am talking to at our apartment anymore. The girl I am talking to has never done more than stay the night and has been friends of our group for several years. \n\nI left and when I came back she was gone. She ended up staying at her parents house with him while they are away. At this point I am just feeling terrible as if my feelings don\u2019t matter. I also just feel bad that she\u2019s upset because she\u2019s a great person to me and I don\u2019t like her being upset. I never stated he couldn\u2019t stay with us but instead just calmly stated how I felt.

Way to set boundaries before it got out of hand. Your person you\u2019ve had over was staying for a defined period of time, totally incomparable.", "She was trying to move him in. You did nothing. NTA. No, a random dude she met on Hinge shouldn't move in.", "NTA it's your space too, and you have a right to not want literal strangers staying for an undetermined amount of time.", "NTA- it sounds like it was one of those, \"oh he's staying til he gets the flight back\" not knowing when that will be or for how long, then turn into \"well he's been here so long , why don't we let him move in with us!\" Type thing. I wouldnt feel comfortable either at all. And theres a difference between staying the night and not knowing how long he would be staying.", "NTA. Sounds like she was trying to move a stranger in without officially saying it", "I think it\u2019s actually pretty great/brave of you to be okay with this random man staying at your apartment when neither of you really know him *that* well so your pal should be grateful for that on its own! Completely understand why you wouldn\u2019t want him to just pitch up for some undefined time period & I think it\u2019s really unfair of her to expect you to be okay with that. Plus, I doubt he\u2019d start contributing to any shopping/bills/etc. if he was there for over a week or something so you\u2019ll end up being out of pocket as well. Definitely NTA & hopefully your friend will see that once she\u2019s had time to calm down.", "NTA, she's known him like what, a month? month and a bit? no fuckin' way would I want someone like that staying at my place indefinitely without having known him for a while. for a couple days, sure, with a definite flight home. but this? no way. stick to your guns. maybe emphasize to your friend that while she might consider it okay, it's your space too. having a practical stranger around for an indefinite period of time is uncomfortable to anyone. (but oh you could use that time to get to know him, she might say, but like. it's a far more comfortable thing to get to know someone within a set timeframe of some get together. not an indefinite situation in your home life.)", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t care if she has guest over whatsoever, whether you have met them for 10mins or not at all, even if they are staying over a couple days. Having someone over for longer than a week in my opinion is a bit to much. Not knowing when he is going to be leaving isn\u2019t something I would be ok with either.", "NTA -  you don't know this guy.  He is a stranger.  And her answers are sus.  I believe that she is trying to move him in under your nose. Good that you stood your ground and your boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
