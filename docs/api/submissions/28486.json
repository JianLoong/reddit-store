Initially I had always planned on my dad walking me down the aisle, but I've unfortunately lost him due to the pandemic, which is sort of what brings me to the problem. \n\nWhen I was 3 my parents split after my mom had an affair with my step-dad, and a few years later my dad remarried to my step-mom. I was split 50/50 between them both but moved permanently with my dad when I was 14. I have half siblings on both sides, and while my step-mom always treated and loved me as equally as her own children, my step-dad always acted like I was worthless or even pretended I wasn't there, and there was a lot of mental abuse he would put me through (I don't feel comfortable with details but it was bad enough my dad had me put in a psychiatric facility when I was 15). My mom never did anything to help, and it really made me resent the both of them and even now our relationship hasn't fully recovered from how he treated me, and my moms lack of care about stopping it. \n\nSo, since I can't have my dad to walk me down the aisle, I opted to ask my step-mom instead because I've always seen her as more of a mother figure in my life than my actual mother (I even had her adopt me after turning 18), and she was ecstatic that I wanted it to be her since she thought I would ask my step-dad or FIL. After finding this out though, my mom got super angry and told me I was being ungrateful to my step-dad for his role as a father figure in my life and I should have asked him instead and my step-dad won't talk to me at all (which I don't really care about since I'm in very very low contact with him), but they're also threatening to stop my half-siblings from attending my wedding if I don't have him walk me down the aisle (2 of them are over 18, but 3 are still minors and they live in another state so getting to my wedding without their parents would be difficult). I really want them there since I absolutely adore my half-siblings, and I'm really worried it'll make my mom stop them from seeing me. My step-mom is now telling me I should just ask him to keep the peace, but I also really don't want to do that since my step-mom absolutely means the world to me and I really wouldn't be where I am without her. \n\nSo basically what I'm trying to ask is am I in the wrong for wanting my step-mom to walk me down the aisle and not my step-dad?", "created_utc": 1696731277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172nlgz/aita_for_wanting_my_stepmom_to_walk_me_down_the/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
