When that wasn't the deal in the first place.\n\n  \nMy name is on the Wi-Fi bill and electric. Is it mean to change the Wi-Fi password so she can't access it? For like the first 3 months of us living together she was sending me $40/mo for her half of Wi-Fi (total is $80/mo) and her half of the electric bill and rent. She was late a few months in a row on rent and stopped sending me the money for the Wi-Fi and electric. We settled on her paying $700 for rent and I pay the remaining $1,147 since I have the master and use the covered parking spot (that she still tries to park in and gets mad at me when I tell her to move her car). As well as we used to alternate buying groceries but now I'm the only one who buys food, I've noticed she never eats it though.\n\n  \nI'm tired of wasting my money on her and getting absolutely nothing in return. She's not even here half the time so why should she need the Wi-Fi anyways.", "created_utc": 1685590284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x70u1/aita_for_wanting_to_change_the_wifi_password/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
