When that wasn't the deal in the first place.\n\n  \nMy name is on the Wi-Fi bill and electric. Is it mean to change the Wi-Fi password so she can't access it? For like the first 3 months of us living together she was sending me $40/mo for her half of Wi-Fi (total is $80/mo) and her half of the electric bill and rent. She was late a few months in a row on rent and stopped sending me the money for the Wi-Fi and electric. We settled on her paying $700 for rent and I pay the remaining $1,147 since I have the master and use the covered parking spot (that she still tries to park in and gets mad at me when I tell her to move her car). As well as we used to alternate buying groceries but now I'm the only one who buys food, I've noticed she never eats it though.\n\n  \nI'm tired of wasting my money on her and getting absolutely nothing in return. She's not even here half the time so why should she need the Wi-Fi anyways.", "created_utc": 1685590284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x70u1/aita_for_wanting_to_change_the_wifi_password/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d do more than change the password. Kick her out and fine a new roommate", "NTA. Reset the password each month, and give her the new one when she\u2019s paid her share of joint expenses. It\u2019s in your name - she has no right to share it if she\u2019s not contributing towards it.", "NTA she won't pay for WiFi, she doesn't need WiFi.", "NTA, she is taking advantage of you", "Well, if she is almost never there, that is going to be something you have to factor in. \n\nYour next roommate might fall in love with a hairy backed loud sex haver who constantly clogs your drain with their fur.", "Sounds like it\u2019s time to search for a new roommate", "NTA but you need a better roommate.", "You need a better roommate. NTA", "I hear you about the wifi and electric but you guys dont need to share groceries just because you live together. Many, many roommates buy their own food so that's not reasonable ask going forward.", "NTA \n\nNo paying up, no Wi-Fi.", "NTA\nShe can whinge once she paid WiFi bills.", "NTA, but wow, 80$ for wifi????", "NTA\n\nI am assuming that you\u2019re also a renter, but because you have the master and covered parking space you should be paying more.", "NTA. You\u2019re not the Wi-Fi fairy. She sounds like a dick anyway.", "Shes trying to take you for a ride NTA", "I second this. Stop wasting your money and give her the ultimatum to step up and do her part or it\u2019s time to go.", "This sounds oddly specific. Do you have anything to share with the rest of us", "She\u2019s not paying for it, she shouldn\u2019t have access to it.", "lol, that's how much my Fios (Northern VA) costs a month... paid more for DSL thru CenturyLink years ago and they barely supplied 3mbps speeds (rural NC) Its a damn racket.", "Kick her out", "I'm shooketh as well \ud83d\uddff", "FR \ud83e\udd23 YES PLEASE SHARE!", "NTA - if you want to be petty about it.\n\nHere's what you state: you pay more in rent, but you have the master bedroom and the covered parking spot. \n\nShe doesn't buy groceries - but she also never eats what you buy. So really you have no beef there. The first thing I'd ask is if she's eating at all, does she have the money to eat? \n\nShe doesn't chip in for the electric and the wi-fi - which she should but then you turn around and state she's hardly ever there. So at this point she's paying rent but you have the place to yourself most of the time. \n\nI mean you have the right to change the password, but the question is what do you get out of it? If she decides to move out and you get a new roommate you might get someone who's around constantly, annoys you and eats all your food. \n\nI think you'd be better to talk to her and ask her why she's not chipping in anymore. Then take it from there.", "Yup, you're the asshole. \"Only 700 dollars?\" How much do you think the average person makes? You can't make a deal with somebody, and then once you realize that you weren't coming out on top at the end of it, change it to suit your needs. Get over it and reprioritize your expenses.", "Change it and don't renew the lease, you don't need a mooch in your life.  NTA", "Really only makes sense to share things like milk. Two or more gallons takes up half the fridge.", "Yeah I've lived with tons of roommates over the years and never once shared groceries - mayyyyybe something like \"oh I'm buying a big bag of rice if you need some\" but", "Actually there was no deal when it comes to Wifi, the only deal was rent. If you\u2019re getting such a good deal on rent then you can fork over $40 for Wi-Fi or get nothing \n\nWi-Fi isn\u2019t a privilege, it\u2019s a luxury that you pay for.", "If it wasn't discussed initially when the deal was made, then it's their loss. As you said, it's only 40 dollars. They shouldn't bitch and moan so much about it and be happy with what they're getting, especially if the roommate does things like clean and cook/wash dishes."]}
