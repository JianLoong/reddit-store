I thought that was gonna be it. \n\nBy 7:30 pm my husband tells me he is out to help one of the neighbour do an errand and he will be back shortly. One hour and a half passes and I'm just like: dudeee, hi? u have a fam? \n\nIts 9 pm and I hear music. Outside our front door. I open the door there it is, my husband and the other dads giving me a serenade! Which is cute, my kid loved it and all. they told me i was the last one of all the wives and I thought well cool, hubby come in and lets make dinner. \n\nBut then... the wives arrive with the kids and everyone gets in my house and the kids started spraying orange juice on the floor, there's chips on every part of my house, toys everywhere, the dadas making hot dogs. \n\nI feel like I'm in a horror movie. I had just cleaned my house, which is no easy task when working and having a kid. I was finally feeling some peace. And then this happened. I wasn't even prepared to see people, I was in fucking booty shorts and no ounce of production on my being. \n\nThey leave and it's past my kids bed time, my house is flipped upside down and I'm furious. I tell him just that, to never do something like that again. \n\nHe gets pissed, telling me at least I had a fucking gift and he got nothing (uhm, heart shaped pancakes are sumthin, fella) and he was trying to make something nice. I told him, in other words, I didn't like it and if he was gonna make something like that I would rather not have anything. \n\nHe got really mad and i told him to clean up all the mess, I had a child to bath and put to sleep. what pisses me out about this is the fact that he didn't tell me beforehand about this, I wasn't okay with the party thingy at our place. The serenade was cute but... everything else? I have to work tomorrow dude, I'm already behind my sleepin hours. \n\nAMITA? Am I being a real bitch about this? Please tell me, I don't know if I should apologize or something, I'm just pissed right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks, xoxo", "created_utc": 1676442087, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112rap5/aita_for_not_appreciating_my_valentines_gift/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I would shoot flaming darts out of my eyeballs straight at his head if he ever invited a bunch of people over without giving me a heads up, especially if I was in my pyjamas.\n\nI think your husband had good intentions though. I think this whole thing could be wrapped up if you could both acknowledge how each of your reactions affected the other, with empathy and sincerity. \n\nNAH", "NTA wow - he invited the whole neighborhood to your house with no heads up or warning. On a work night wow", "NTA he gifted you work and needs to understand that his gift came with a labor requirement on your part without your consent", "NTA Wrecking a house you just cleaned is not a \"gift,\" sorry. They should have just gone door to door and serenaded all the wives and left it at that, that could've been a nice gift. Inviting a ton of people inside to trash the house? Nope.", "NTA. It's your house also. You get to have a say in whether or not a party takes place. Your husband is a major AH for this move, and he demanded you to appreciate it? He didn't even offer to clean things up himself?", "NTA sure couldve been nicer in explaining that you didn't like it, but yeah that's a lot of disruption you didn't ask for. Honestly just sounds like y'all need to communicate better, if he felt he didn't get a gift maybe discuss expectations? Telling him you want family time on holidays like this and to not have to deal with others is super understandable.", "NTA. The gift is for the receiver, not the giver! He meant well but didn\u2019t think it through.", "NTA and time for another PSA to not throw surprise parties.", "NTA\n\nAin't no fucking way.", "OK so let me get this straight. All the husbands got together, decided to cosplay as a rock band, and went door to door singing a song to each partner until they got to the last house which happened to be yours?  Then decided to make the last house the party house for everyone? Apparently spontaneously? Yeah right.\n\n Your husband is TA, pancakes or no.", "NTA\n\nNothing says \"romance\" like giving your wife a bunch of extra unpaid labor in the form of cleaning up!", "NTA. A gift that makes a mess of the house that the recipient is expected to clean up is a shitty, poorly-thought out gift.", "NTA. You having to host a party without any notice is not a gift. Reminds me of stories of men giving their wives vacuums as a gift.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't give you a gift. He gave you a whole lot of work to do.\n\nHis concept was sweet. The idea of the husband's going around serenading all of their wives? Very thoughtful. \n\nBut why couldn't you have been one of the wives that got serenaded, and then everyone left? At what point did your house get picked to host a party close to bedtime on a week night? Make it clear that that's where your point of contention is.\n\nLeaving him to clean up was an important step. He needed to understand how much work he dumped on you.\n\nBut honestly, yes, you probably should have put in a little more effort for Valentine's Day.  I say that because your husband did go out of his way to plan something special for you. You didn't need to spend money on him, but it sounds like under the circumstances that some sort of reciprocal gesture was needed. He needs to feel appreciated and cherished by you. Not just as co-recipient of heart-shaped pancakes with the kiddo.\n\nThe fact that you didn't realize you needed to do something indicates two things to me:\n1) You may be doing the same thing I did as a young mom and forgetting to make the romance of your marriage a priority. Remember all the effort you made when you were dating? Once kids enter a marriage, all of our energy is devoted towards them, toward maintaining a household. But we need to sometimes tap into that old dating vibe and remember that we are maintaining a romance, not just a working partnership.\n2) You both need to communicate better about things that might hurt your feelings. You can't read each other's minds, and it's not fair for either of you to expect that. If your husband feels unappreciated, un-romanced, he needs to speak up. When you are planning to low-key it for Valentine's Day (my favorite way to handle the day), you need to actually initiate a discussion to clarify expectations.\n\nDo you owe him an apology? Not for objecting to the party that he dropped in your lap with no warning. You are correct that this needs to be made very clear to him: It is never a gift to bring unexpected company into your home, disrupt your evening schedule, and expect you to have to clean up for everyone.\n\nShould you apologize for hurting his feelings? I would. Whether you intended to or not, whether you even did anything wrong or not, the bottom line is that his feelings are hurt. He deserves to have that acknowledged.", "\"Coincidences of life\" aka Covid", "NTA! You gift for him was a clean house\u2026 now he can start sweeping, hoovering and mopping while throwing a tantrum! It\u2019s not cool to bring over 8 adults with toddlers without as much as a warning!", "NTA, but honestly heart shaped pancakes is not a gift. You could for sure have out effort into something for him. He still sucks for bombarding you with hosting people, though.", "YTA. It may have not been the best idea of your husband to surprise you with this party, but he meant well. You getting furious about it was uncalled for. You did not handle this well, you should have just told him calmly afterwards that you prefer to know such plans beforehand and be involved in it, and ask him to remember that if he gets such an idea in the future. If he does it again the same way, then you can get angry.", "ESH\n\nI don't think you don't not appreciate your gift, it's the forced celebration in your sanctuary that wasn't even passed by you. You had every right to be upset and you damn well should be, but you could have maybe approached it differently, but so could he. While the thought was lovely, and it should have stopped at the serenade, he was inconsiderate to force the event on you and I'd be he didn't help clean up, did he? As for the petty comment about not getting something, that proves you need to communicate better. He may have needs he needs filling that he wont express, as you clearly probably do too. He should consider your place in that family and home. You should both apologize and talk to one another.", "NAH\n\nHe made a bad call creating chaos at home on a worknight when you are clearly not the type of person who is comfortable with last minutes guests.  His idea for a gift ignored your likes and dislikes so that is disappointing.  \n\nOn the other hand, sounds like maybe you were feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the whole situation and let out your feelings on him with angry words. \n\nNext time to avoid this kind of situation you need to remove yourself before you get to the boiling point - go for a walk, take a long bathroom break, and then just let him know that it is nice that he wanted to have a party but that you need him to clean it all up before he comes to bed so that you can all get ready for work in the morning.  Hopefully he knows better than to surprise you with a messy toddler party again.", "NTA... he shouldn't make party without asking you...\nBut funcakes as a gift?", "ESH you both chose to see the worst intentions in each other's actions. You for assuming he'd understand your frustration about having people over after you've clean. While valid, he clearly didn't see it from your perspective. You could've explained it to him in a calmer manner as what he was trying to do was a loving gesture.\n\nHim for getting on the defensive and being ungrateful about your gift. Y'all should've communicated expectations on what you both wanted.\n\nAnyway, you both need to speak when cooler heads prevail. This is really all down to communicating and not assuming ill intent from one another.", "ESH - The way this scenario sounds, I think what really happened is your husband thought he fell short in the Valentines day present route, so he made the excuse that he had to help with something. Then the husbands all gathered to shoot ideas around and came up with the serenade stuff, maybe they were coming up with their own lyrics unless they just sang songs they knew. They went to each other's houses to surprise and sing and your house was last...and then they ruined everything because surprise, party at your place, with all wives and kids in tow. \n\nIn retrospect, it was cute what they all did, and it was very sweet. But the thing about men is that they like to be spontaneous, and that's how they have their fun, and they don't want to plan every minute of their lives. It's nice to do spontaneous things once in a while, but I think what hubby should have done after everyone was gone, was to tell you to not worry that he'd start cleaning the messes asap all on his own and then do it.\n\nIt seems like it was a one off type thing, and seems like most of the adults wanted to hangout with other adults for a bit (which I hear becomes a desperate thing they want sometimes after having toddlers/kids etc aka want real conversation not baby talk all day). \n\nI honestly think you should forgive him and just discuss how to either avoid this type of thing from happening again in the future or even have some type of signals or code phrases you say in front of others so u can sneak off and have a quick whisper to like say ok it's late can you try to convince your buddies that it's time to leave.", "Ilove how so many say NTA and blaming hubby. Tell you what from being a hubby for decades now.\nHer reaction makes her TA. He gifted her a present. He might have given her warning, OK, but she said herself the serenade thing was cool. And it seems they have the smallest Kid, so the decision to have the sit in at their place is reasonable.\nShe flipped out at him.\nShe could have approached it with much more compassion. He made her a gift, he didn't cheat on her.\n\nBut beyond the question of being an AH or not I think hubby learned his lesson. \nNo heartfelt presents for wife anymore. \nNext years will be simple flowers and standard presents. Nothing from the hear but from the shop. Maybe even forget about it. She doesn't care anyway, right?\n\nIf she ever thinks about complaining about his inconsiderate presents in the future she might remember this day and her reaction to his last heartfelt present.", "ESH, you two suck at communication and these are things that could've been discussed in a much better way. If you didn't want a big party and get-together...why didn't you say that earlier in the night? Why didn't you suggest to the other parents that they help clean up?\n\nIt sounds like he set up a big surprise, thought you loved it, you went along with it, and as soon as you two were alone you blew up after hours of frustration.\n\nWas he an AH for springing a big surprise party on you? Yes. Were you an AH for not communicating to him before? Also yes.\n\nBoth of you should apologize, tell him that he can't throw any parties without your permission and though you understand the sentiment, you would rather have valentines day be a chill relaxing day with the two of you over a big celebration.", "YTA - I\u2019m going against the grain here so I\u2019ll take the downvotes. Your husband did a sweet thing. It may have had unintentional consequences but your reaction makes you the AH. If you had received a necklace and didn\u2019t like that and threw a fit everyone would be saying your the AH. Gifts don\u2019t always have to be liked it\u2019s supposed to be the thought that counts. It\u2019s generally good manors and form to thank the person. You could have had a civil conversation and told him although you liked the serenade for future reference that is too late for a gathering because of x y and z. I wouldn\u2019t be able expecting anything from him anytime soon after that reaction.", "Yes, YTA. He did something to try to make you smile. He was in cahoots with the neighborhood dads to do something sweet for all their wives. And he thought he could speak for his half of your couplehood that yours could be the final stop for an impromptu gathering. Heart shaped pancakes are a little sweet acknowledgment but no mi\u2019lady they are *not* a gift, nice try on that one. Maybe his sweet gesture caught you off guard and made extra work for both of you. I hope after sleeping on it you see how sweetly intended it was. You should apologize and laugh at your reaction and make up with him. This can be a funny story in your history and not a sore spot.", "YTA\n\n(First of all English is not my first language so sorry for any grammar errors)\n\nI understand your point of view but...\n\nHe made an effort to make a good Valentine's, he must had this planned for days or week. If he makes a post with his point of you, you would be the AH. Imagine to try to gift your loved one something special for Valentine's and they, asides not gifting you anything (I don't think the pancakes makes a good gift) just start arguing with you and posting that you are a burden for doing so.\n\nEven with that the only reason you are the AH is because of your reaction, you should be more delicate with this type of things, its okay to not like some gifts but not this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
