Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.", "ESH he\u2019s an ass for the comment especially saying it loud enough for you to hear but your comeback wasn\u2019t as clever as you thought it was\u2026 it was just fat shamming tbh", "ESH", "ESH \n\nyou could tell him he was being rude without deciding to insult his appearance.", "YTA, not a clever comeback and not even slightly warranted. Commenting on a tight shirt warrants body shaming? Not a cute look, man\n\nEdit: After reading more of your responses, yeah this definitely didn't happen. Keep tryna flatter yourself though!", "ESH with a hint of YTA \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have kept their mouths shut to begin with. But they commented on your clothes which is easily fixable. You body shamed them which isn\u2019t cool and has a much longer, lasting impact on them (or anyone).", "YTA. That\u2019s not a comeback that\u2019s you just being fatphobic. \n\nMaybe they were laughing at you because you are one of THOSE people in the gym.", "He\u2019s an AH your an AH. I hate gyms because I would like to get a workout in and not talk or have that sort of negativity around me. Sounds like a bad moment for all.", "ESH. Insulting someone doesn't undo their uncouth behavior, it just lowers the discourse for everyone.", "ESH, he was rude you were mean.", "ESH\n\nCalling someone fat isn't really all that clever.", "ESH\n\nThey shouldn\u2018t have commented on you like that behind your back or in general. Mocking clothes is idiotic. Now with your description of what they said it\u2018s not clear wether they only mocked your choice of putting on a tight top or even objectified you on your body attributes. Both is not okay (the latter even worse)\n\nBut you are hitting right back at what\u2019s probably the person\u2019s weak spot. Bodyshaming a person who actually tries to do something to lose weight and is actively going to the gym is why so many people with weight issues don\u2018t dare to go to the gym. It was a low blow. \n\nYou should have either told them that you don\u2018t appreciate them commenting on you or comment on the same level, e.g. clothes choices.", "Honestly YTA you escalated and I\u2019m just bothered you thought calling a person fat was clever?", "Aita?

A little narcissistic, perhaps, but I guess you worked for it, so you do you.  You shouldn\u2019t be surprised that people notice it though \u2014 that\u2019s what you wanted after all \u2014 and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that some people might find it a little bizarre.

I really don\u2019t understand most of these responses. You were definitely justified. He was being an ass and got a response based on that.

There's a reason some gyms ban tank tops and you're a good example why.", "ESH, but clever would have been mentioning the jerk store called and ran out of him!", "The E S H confuses me tbh. The guy is a chubby guy in the gym. And most chubby guys get self conscious that people are looking at them and making fun of them for being overweight. So this guy had something he was insecure about which is his belly, and he decides to throw out insults? I honestly don\u2019t see how you\u2019re the ass hole here.

Ur NTA in my opinion", "NTA!!!\n\nIt would have been better off to not get involved. Also, you should get shirts that fit.\n\nHowever, THEY were assholes. You just stood up for yourself a bit.", "NTA\n\nI get being the bigger person and that 2 wrongs don't make a right, but in the moment you reacted as you did. Was it the best way to handle the situation? No. But it sure taught (hopefully) those guys a lesson. \n\nWe live in an ever growing world where people don't think there's consequences for their actions.
