I am sympathetic to the bond between a person and their dog, but the fact that the dog has growled at your child already and bites is what counts - you have a very small child, and your #1 job is protecting them, and, if it isn't safe to have the dog around the child, then you can't have the dog around the child.", "NTA.

Perhaps the chihuahua can visit her in the garden.", "NTA. Tell your mom is the dog or a place at your house.", "Aside from the dog's problem with elimination, the dog growls and snaps at your little one who has run of the house. That's a major concern in addition to the fact this Chihuahua is generally mean to everyone. It's great you have someone to take him off your mother's hands. NTA.", "Yep and at that size ratio the Chihuahua can do serious damage. Lifelong scars. \n\nPeeing alone could be solved with doggy diapers. (Some dogs I have dealt with trained themselves because they hated wearing the diaper and feeling the consequences of their action) but aggression isn't something anyone in this situation is prepared to address.", "You know, it\u2019s concerning to me that OP\u2019s mother seems to care more about the mouthy dog than her one year old grandchild. \n\nHere\u2019s a thing that not a lot of people want to talk about: animals get rehomed all the time. It\u2019s not ideal but sometimes it\u2019s the best thing for the pet and all the people involved.", "Agreed. It\u2019s incredibly painful to have to rehome a dog, but your 1 year old\u2019s safety has to come first. A chihuahua is just not a great dog to have around children, unfortunately.", "Yeah, but it sounds like OP\u2019s mother is not physically capable of caring for the dog solo. It might be better for the dog to live with a person/family more able to care for it properly.", "Unfortunately while the dog is being trained it poses a risk to the child =(\n\nNTA", "She says the dog bites and draws blood.

It's a dog with no training that attacks everyone who comes close and pees on everything, if it were any larger than a Chihuahua it would probably be put down for it's violent and aggressive tendencies. It's ridiculous how people accept this kind of behaviour from some dog breeds but then froth at the mouth when a different one does the same thing.\n\nOP is NTA without a doubt.

Its annoying but not the end of the world. But biting, especially for a small dog, is very tricky and they shouldn't be in a home with small kids. Kids are chaos, and chaos is hard to train for or predict", "Right. The mil is not a responsible dog owner and she is incapable of caring or training the dog properly. It's just a horrible news story waiting to happen.", "Ex MiL had a chihuahua, I don't know if it was naturally aggressive or just badly trained, but I had to keep my distance as it went for visitors, every time. \n\n\nYou feel such a fool fending of something not much bigger than a guinea pig on stilts, but it had teeth, claws and a taste for blood.", "a properly trained chihuahua is 100% a great dog to have around a child", "This!", "And the compromise solution of keeping the dog in one room all day will only make it more prone to that kind of behavior.", "Sure, but that\u2019s not the norm, and it\u2019s not what OP is describing here.", "I know a couple of them, but their owners trained and socialized them very intentionally. That doesn\u2019t sound like the case with OP\u2019s mom.", "Actually, Chihuahuas are good little dogs. Most of their owners though\u2026. \n\nBad owners result in bad pets.

Still miss him.", "YTA for having poorly behaved dogs yourself AND for not reporting dog bites that cause bleeding.", "NTA. This is heartbreaking and I feel for you. The peeing and biting would be a nonstarter for me even without the 1 year old who is absolutely the priority here. I feel for your mom too, but she is lucky she is able to stay with you. She may not care about the pee but it is not sanitary. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA.. if you have a willing hero ready to take this dog then that is the solution.  It will be difficult on your mom, but it would be Impossible for you", "NTA\n\nchild before dog every single time. Pity that MIL is upset - she can either stay with you in a way that protects your child and respects your home or she can live somewhere else with the four-legged biting pee machine .", "Caesar Milan once commented that if there weren't Chihuahuas, he might not be in business (because so many have behavior issues).\n\nI know this sounds mean, but is getting a cat an option instead of a leaky biting small dog? I don't disagree with rehoming the dog, but elderly often are eased by their interactions with pets. But, not everyone is a cat person - or a dog person.\n\nNTA", "No, you're right.  Your mom's just really sad, but let her meet the person who's taking her dog.", "NTA", "NAH. It's just really sad. I feel for your mother as I'm sure she's so attached to her dog and not living with him will break her heart. But also you're right for putting your child's safety first. Is there no way your mum could live in some kind of assisted living situation with her dog?", "NTA Children often inadvertently do things to provoke dogs. In this situation, you have a dog that is already showing offensive aggression and a soon-to-be toddler. It would only be a matter of time until the dog bites the child.\n\nI say this as someone who has done behavior work with shelter dogs for more than 10 years and has had a parade of foster dogs.", "We actually have 2 other larger dogs that are very kid friendly. They do eat my mother's food off her plate though.", "So they should just tolerate destroyed, piss soaked floors because old lady sad?

When a dog is tethered or confined, they become extremely protective of the small area that they have. So the dog will start guarding that room. And when the toddler wanders into that room, the dog will protect that room and attack the invader.\n\nConfining/tethering a dog is a great was to make them aggressive."]}
