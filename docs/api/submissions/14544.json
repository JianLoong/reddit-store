I'm glad she will have you for support and l'll be home if she wants to call or FaceTime afterwards.\u201d I told my MIL that my wife had left later than expected and likely wouldn\u2019t be home until 11PM now and she said that John would call Monday evening instead. \n\nLater, my wife called from the car to check-in because she was still about 1.5-2 hours away and wanted a little break from her podcasts. I\u2019m not sure what in the conversation made me think of it, but I told her about the text from her mom earlier. She immediately started asking me what could be wrong, asked me to read the exact text, and was stressing out over it. She ended the call a few minutes later. \n\nWhen she got home, she was upset and angry at me for telling her. She didn\u2019t want to ruin my \u201ccredibility\u201d with her mom and family, so although she didn\u2019t tell them she knew there was something going on, she had reached out to both her mom and John to see if they wanted to talk while she was driving and her mom never responded to her text while her brother said he wasn\u2019t free. By the time she got home, she said she had already searched arrest records near his college as well as local newspaper sites and couldn\u2019t find anything about what this upsetting news could be.\n\nWe had a big argument about what I did. She thinks that I shouldn\u2019t have told her when I knew they\u2019d be calling the next evening after her work day was over, and that I especially shouldn\u2019t have told her when she was alone in the car driving.

You unfairly triggered anxiety and worry that was unnecessary.  There are times when secrets are appropriate.", "NTA for giving her a heads up but soft y t a for the timing. Telling her when she got home would\u2019ve been a better play just so she\u2019s not on the road distracted/ stressed out/ panicking. It could\u2019ve waited the 2 hours. \n\nTelling her that bad news is coming is ok though. Her mom warned you I\u2019m advance so it stands to reason that you could pass on the warning. I definitely think your wife over reacted and went I to panic mode\u2026 if she is a chronic over thinker and/or gets stressed easily you prob should\u2019ve taken that into consideration before telling her. You should know her well enough to know these things.", "NTA.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t told her, and then later she finds out that her mother told you bad news was coming BUT you didn\u2019t tell her, you\u2019d have been in trouble for keeping things from her.\n\nIt was a rotten situation for you to be in and I soft side-eye your MIL for putting you in the middle.", "NTA I'm all for the truth, although I want to know what the upsetting news is, can't even imagine how she felt", "Nta.

Not yr fault.", "i'm going with NAH. your MIL told you it was upsetting and that your wife might need support. maybe she wanted both of you to be prepared, either because your wife is sensitive or john is sensitive and she wanted you to approach the facetime that way. all you did was relay the information given to you, knowing your wife would be home soon. obviously, whatever it was could wait another day. \n\nnow, if you know your wife is the type to easily go into an anxiety spiral, that's on you. but it seems like it would be weird for you to keep this secret with your MIL about your wife's brother.", "NTA sorry dude.

You are allowed to have your own anxiety and feelings around this being dropped on you, and naturally you turned to your wife to tell her what had happened.", "I can't believe the number of people calling you TA; no doubt you were in an unwinnable position but this is on your MIL. After reading through your comments, I see that the \"bad news\" was wife's brother was having a mental health crisis and checked himself into treatment.  Isn't that \"good news\"? MIL sounds like the type that needs to share news first or wants to be the center of attention!\n\nNTA", "NAH, you were only relaying the exact message as received however, I understand the anxiety your wife feels.", "Ehhh I think NAH, but your MIL and you could have probably handled it a little better.\n\nWithout knowing the full context, it is tough to tell someone 'there's BAD news but I can't tell you right now/don't know.' That would definitely stress your wife and probably have her freaking out the entire time. It sucks to know \\~something\\~ bad has happened without knowing what.\n\nWas there any inkling of what it could be? I mean, your wife could have thought there was a death in her family or something, which would understandably freak her out and she probably wouldn't be able to chill until she knew what was up. \n\nYour MIL was super cryptic to tell you what she did without explaining the situation- like, what's the point of that? It also puts you in a weird position where you know something is up, and don't want to lie/pretend to your wife that everything is good when you get a message like that.\n\nAll in all, your MIL was probably the worst offender and should have just told your wife from the beginning and not have told you something cryptic. I can see why your wife would be upset and stressed when she only has 'something terrible has happened' to go on. And I think you were just caught in the middle of it.\n\nIt's best practice to just tell people the bad news, and not say 'something' bad has happened to leave people to freak out about what it could possibly be. Either say the whole story or don't say anything at all.", "Soft YTA, even though you didn't intend it.\n\nTelling her while she was driving would OBVIOUSLY stress her out hugely and result in a lot of worry on her part.

You put her in a cloud of worry for an entire day. You told her while she was alone when you'd been told she would need support.", "Soft YTA. There are times to keep a secret and times you shouldn't. This is one of the times you should have kept it.", "You and MIL are both the AH. First MIL for stressing you out with this ominous warning, and then you for stressing your wife out. I hate when i know there is bad news, but i don't know what it is. I imagine the worst possible things. Hope it's not as bad as MIL made it sound!", "Soft YTA. Obviously you didn\u2019t intend harm. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s pretty shitty to say \u201chey btw you\u2019re gonna get a call in a few hours with some terrible news that I\u2019m not going to say anything about\u2026k bye!\u201d Like that\u2019s really not cool. There\u2019s no point in stressing someone out when they can\u2019t do anything about it.  Sometimes it\u2019s best to just not say anything and wait.", "NTA. Maybe your MIL shouldn\u2019t have gave you a warning that bad news was coming I feel like that\u2019s one of the worst things you can do because it can fuel anxiety and overthinking, but I can understand if she did this because she wanted to make sure your wife was home to support you. I think you also might have fueled some anxiety in your wife but I can understand you did it to prevent keeping secrets. NTA but I think you two should talk and you can explain to her that you did it to avoid keeping secrets (if that was the cases),", "Soft YTA  I don't think your MIL should have said \"they had some upsetting news\" if she wasn't willing to tell you what it was.  That being said you should not have told your wife until she was safely home, and even then perhaps waited until her brother called since you literally had no useful information.  I was on a long awaited vacation to a pretty inaccessible place one time, and  my mother wanted the SAT phone number in case something happened.  I gave it to her, but told her since I can't get home any sooner that is planned, please don't call me with bad news.  There will be absolutely nothing I can do about it until I get home, and I would rather my vacation wasn't ruined.  Maybe this makes me selfish, but oh well.", "This is perspective but I want to sayNTA. I had a trip overseas with friends and on the second night into a 10 day trip my parent was in the hospital. They called me a day later contemplating if they should tell me and I\u2019m glad they did. I was anxious and sad but I could never shoot the messenger. I think his wife needs to keep herself in check too. If it was urgent they would\u2019ve called her directly. Patience is necessary too.", "Soft yta. There was nothing she could do from where she was at, so why add the stress? When my niece passed away I was at rehearsal, which ends late in the evening. My husband didn't say anything till i had safely commuted home because he knew if I knew i wouldn't be able to cycle safely. That's the way to go with bad news that cant be helped.", "Soft YTA for OP but op\u2019s mother in law is a giant asshole. Telling someone you\u2019re going to give them bad news in the future is psychological torture because the person anticipating it is going to imagine every worst case scenario.", "YTA what did you hope to accomplish with that? You put her in a worry all day while she was in a position where not only she didn\u2019t know what the news was, she couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation. It could have waited until she came home", "NTA.

If the amount of time you'd be \"keeping it from her\" was less than one day, and the reason for waiting was that she'd have support and would get actual specifics from her brother instead of whatever nightmare scenario her brain can create from the vagueness, then it's actually a good thing for you to take on that *temporary* tension over the lack of transparency, because it's a way for you to take care of your partner.", "Now I just want to know what the upsetting news is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\nIf you hadn't told her, she would have been upset that you hadn't told her.", "YTA you seem to have really poor instincts", "NTA.

Block MIL and brother and let your wife be the one who speaks to them from now on since they are subjecting you to this idiocy.", "Not saying anything until she can actually get the call and figure out what is going on is how you \u201cwin\u201d this situation. Keeping your mouth shut and not stressing someone out further is actually quite simple. She\u2019s going to get the news no matter what, telling her about it beforehand without offering any other information is an unnecessary and shitty thing to do.", "Why are we assuming that this was *only* stressful for OP\u2019s wife and not also for OP?? If my MIL called me and said that my husband would getting some upsetting news but would tell me what it was, I\u2019d be concerned/freaking out, too. It\u2019s ok that MIL did it to OP but not that OP relayed this to his wife?", "That's what the MIL did though. She didn't have to tell that the brother was calling with bad news. She then put the husband in the no win situation of either telling the truth or keeping things from his wife, which she likely would've gotten mad about too. \n\nAnd while it sucks to have anxiety while you are waiting for it, at least the wife won't be blindsided whenever the bad news comes.", "I sort of just went through this. MIL is out of the country. One of her kids emailed saying she needed to talk\u2026in 18 hours and then went radio silent. \n\nI woke up to about 6 messages in 3 different mediums, some with my husband on them some without, begging for info because she was terrified a grandkid or child was dying/dead. I ended up giving her the broad strokes, because while it was bad news and not mine to share, I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of her panicking for another 10 hours. \n\nFor everyone out there, this is a terrible way to set up a call to deliver bad news. Don\u2019t do it. And if someone is doing it anyways, don\u2019t make it worse. Now, did I know beforehand that bad news was a-coming?  Yep, but I also knew that it wasn\u2019t going to come any faster if I warned her 48 hours earlier - I would just cause her undue stress - and so I did the N T A thing and kept my mouth shut", "If my partner withheld such a text from me, I'd regard it as a huge betrayal.

And then I'd rip a strip off my mother for having put OP in that position.\n\n~~Gonna guess that MIL has a record of shit stirring and her daughter is conditioned to see it as normal, and is unable/unwilling to confront her over this behavior.~~\n\nBut again, if my partner knows about something that will impact me significantly and withholds that info, that's a serious fucking problem.\n\nIn my mind it's acting in a high handed manner and not permitting me full agency over my life.\n\nOP did nothing wrong. ~~MIL is toxic as fuck.~~\n\nEdit: see my response to OP below.", "Truth without tact is often just cruelty.", "I don't even think you could count this as technically a secret, more like a delayed conversation. \nYeah soft YTA, she's driving and couldn't really do anything but worry constantly, letting the unknown build and build and build.", "MIL probably let OP know that the bed would be upsetting so he could ensure he was with his wife to provide support when that call happened.\n\nBut yeah I agree with you on everything else.", "Right! And then the MIL didn't even tell him what the bad news was so he could make an educated decision on whether it was something he immediately needed to relay to his wife or not so she could then react accordingly.

WTAF?", "NAH.\n\nHonestly, you guys have learned something about each other's preferences about such things.  Work on it from that angle; 'damn, babe, I didn't realize you wouldn't have wanted to know, I'm so sorry.  Lets discuss what each of us would prefer in this kind of situation so we know going forward.'\n\nYour MIL, however, is an asshole for putting all that on you.", "ETA..\n\nWhy the MIL gave the heads up like that is anyone's guess. That doing to him what he did to his wife..", "I wouldn\u2019t have shared the news while she was away, but I would have for sure told her upon her return.", "NTA. I would be livid if my partner withheld something like that from me.", "NAH except MIL.\n\nThat's not how you do it!!!\nMy mom would do it this way and have me in a right panic, so I may be projecting a little... But omg it drives me nuts.\n\nThen it turns out the news could have been a text.", "This one's tricky, bcs if you HADN'T told her, many people would be arguing SHE'S YOUR WIFE, YOU OWED IT TO HER! I say NTA but also the way EVERYONE in this story handled this was just wrong lol.", "NTA  Complete overreaction on her part", "NTA - your MIL is though, all of this could have been avoided if she didn't forecast the call to you ahead of time.", "NTA and I would\u2019ve done the same as a spouse. If anything I can see OP\u2019s wife being mad if he didn\u2019t say anything. Bad news should basically always be delivered (to adults, anyway) ASAP. That\u2019s just\u2026maturity. Y\u2019all are weird.", "NTA, Neither is the wife. But the MIL is for sure! Who intentionally stresses someone out like that?", "ESH", "I\u2019m giving you the side eye here, but really it\u2019s on MIL here. Just barely NTA but this situation is weird.", "NTA MIL called to prewarn that news was coming. OP passed on the pre-warning so SO could also be prepared. He could not tell more because he didn't know more. SO decided on her own to stop driving (her only task) and to work herself into a panic by researching every emergency she could think of. Her job was get home safely, then could discuss it with OP. Which was all they could reasonably do until they knew more. \nMIL could have called when SO was home, but she didn't know, so not her fault. Life doesn't always work out perfectly and SO shouldn't blame OP.", "NTA", "YTA why tell her when there was nothing she could do but fixate? Seems like an unconscious punishment for her going to go have fun without you.", "Your wifes family dynamic is completly nuts and you may want to stay out of it in the future....", "Literally, I'd be so mad if my partner got a text like that and then DIDNT inform me. There's no winning here, MIL just sucks.", "Hard disagree. This is a \u201cdammed if you do\u201d, \u201cdamned if you don\u2019t\u201d type of situation.

His state of mind has no value.\n\nNAH except MIL", "It was never supposed to be a secret, and I tell my husband everything. He is an extension of me we do not keep secrets.\n\nIt\u2019s her mom and her brother. It\u2019s her business and not a secret, so NTA in my opinion, but yeah that will cause anyone anxiety. She\u2019s not handling it well.\n\nIt must not be that bad if it can wait", "was he supposed to keep it a secret from her? and not tell her pertinent information about her family? honestly, that would be a bigger betrayal to me", "What the actual fuck are you on about? He passed on news about a family member. OP is nta at all. \n\nHis wife sounds like a miserable wreck of a human.", "Exactly!! And what if MIL/BIL had called later and said, \u201cwell we told OP we had bad news to tell you. Didn\u2019t he mention it??\u201d", "Yeah, it's pretty easy to picture a situation where OP doesn't tell his wife, and then she finds out he knew and he gets \"YOU KNEW THIS FOR TWO DAYS AND DIDN'T EVEN WARN ME?\"", "Honestly, I have the feeling interactions with the wife's family would be stressful all around. The wife's first reaction was to search *arrest records and the news --* that's either a massive over reaction or says a lot about what she thinks this \"bad news\" could be.", "Maybe at least wait until she got home though.", " That's beyond annoying to call you up and say your BIL will be calling with info.", "I am fine with MIL being the AH in this situation, but she is definitely not toxic or a shit-stirrer. She is the kindest woman and both her and my wife were deeply affected by another one of her children/my wife\u2019s siblings surviving a suicide attempt less than two years ago. \n\nThe upsetting news that my BIL was going to tell my wife ended up being that he had checked himself into a mental health facility for a few days due to having serious suicidal thoughts himself.", "Sounds like kind of a clusterfuck of a bad situation, bad timing, and not so great communication. I think my only criticism for the future would be do not tell people things that might cause them so much stress while they\u2019re driving, especially that late at night for that long. It was kind of MILs fault for putting you in that position, but you should have at least waited until she was home safely.", "Yikes, while that does sound like a triggering conversation, the anticipation of a serious conversation sounds like it would be equally triggering. Honestly, I feel like given the context, scheduling a serious phone call should have come with the preamble, \"everyone's fine\". Either MIL should have said that or you should have found confirmed that yourself before saying anything to your wife.", "Oh that's just bullshit.  Sorry dude, but stirring everyone up for days just to tell you THAT? That is not 'the kindest woman' at all!  YTA for not demanding clarification and yet still passing the ominous heebie jeebies onto your wife.", "But by saying this is how OP \"wins\" you are assuming she *won't* be mad that OP knew something was up and intentionally kept this from her - you are taking a position based on her not reacting badly to that, while simultaneously criticizing others for also taking a guess on her response with the same level of knowledge.  Pot, I'd like you to meet my friend, kettle.  OP had no winning play in this situation, by reporting that there was a big problem but not what it was MIL was spreading drama for its own sake.", "Lately I have been wanting a MAH option for Multiple Assholes Here", "It doesn't. ESH is used when the OP and at least one other person involved are the assholes.

Exactly!", "NAH. My sister's husband got some bad news while we were hanging out and my sister was out of town on a fun trip. He asked me if he should tell her right away or wait to not ruin her trip, he really wasn't sure. I knew from prior experience what the correct answer was FOR HER because we'd been through a similar situation before. OP, you now know what your wife prefers in this kind of situation - going forward, Y W B T A for making the same choice again. Everyone's different and you can't magically know all the perfect answers without having been through similar situations or talked about it.", "So what happened??!!!!!!  I need to know!!!!!", "YTA for not telling us what the news was. Also for not grilling you mom or brother for what the issue was right away.", "NTA.\n\nYou wanted to prepare your wife but unfortunately for you MIL was not forthcoming. If anything, MIL is TA for putting you in the position where you know something's coming but can't give any detail.", "NTA, you relayed a message, I understand your wife is upset but she's an AH for trying to blame you for telling her the information you received.", "Nah. Rock - you - hard place.", "Unsure but what was the news?!?!", "This is so weirdly secretive to me\u2026. I mean, if my MIL sent me a message like that I would assume it was appropriate to let my wife know\u2026 and if I was the wife I certainly wouldn\u2019t think that would \u201cruin my husbands credibility with my mother\u201d\u2026. \n\nI feel like the simplest thing would be for the wife to phone her mom when she got home and be like \u201chey husband just showed me the message is everyone ok?\u201d Like none of this secretive MIL told me that your brother has something he wants to tell you but don\u2019t tell your mom I told you stuff needed to happen and just caused people anxiety. \n\nAnd because of that I say your NTA", "NTA. Your wife and her family sound exhausting.", "also, don't you postpone telling someone bad news before they make a long drive?\n\nBecause it's dangerous for them to be in an emotional and unstable state before they set off on their journey? \n\nyou goofed up really bad here. Were you mad that she went for a weekend away and wanted revenge for it? \n\nYTA", "op=YTA\n\nit would have been fine to tell her once she was home, but not while driving.", "I wouldn't go so far as to say YTA, but did you seriously think it was a wise decision to tell her about potentially upsetting news she'd have to wait to hear about while she was alone and stuck in a car for hours? \n\nThat wasn't kind of you.", "And if he kept it secret he\u2019d be an asshole for not telling. No win scenario. Her mother should never have texted him.", "NTA I don\u2019t think they should have told you anything, they should have just asked when she would be in and called back then or they should have shot her a text asking her when she\u2019d be free to talk. You just were given the ball and you did what you thought was best at the time, hindsight is always 20/20 and you did what you thought you should do.", "NTA. \n\nMIL is the one who put you and your wife in this position. That\u2019s the person your wife should be upset with. \n\nHow can she go hard on you for putting her in this anxiety-inducing situation, *when her own mother put YOU in this exact situation* which is somehow okay ?", "YTA. Especially telling her when she was driving alone. She could have crashed for the worry", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a case of d*mn if you do and d*mn if you don\u2019t.", "Omg that MIL put you in an impossible situation. First of all, she should have told you, \u201cJohn is ok but he checked himself into a facility. He wants to speak directly to his sister about it. Can you help facilitate that?\u201d NOT the ominous hinting that could mean *anything*. There is no reason the basic facts of the matter should have been withheld from you or your wife. Absolutely fine for BIL to decide who gets details about his health, but NOT fine for MIL to say it was \u201cupsetting\u201d without making it clear that John is now in professional care and therefore not in immediate danger. In this case I think NTA and MIL (albeit unintentionally) is.", "NTA. I probably would have waited until she was home, but I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong", "YTA \n\nNever, ever, tell someone that something terrible had happened while you know they are driving and still have a while to go. Do you really want your wife frantic and distracted behind the wheel while trying to find out what it was that happened? That's what you did.", "NTA. If your first reaction to unknown bad news is to check news and arrest records, there\u2019s something off with the brother if not the whole family. You know what I would have thought? Cancer or another terminal illness. Assuming one\u2019s brother has committed a crime is only the most likely scenario if your brother has certain tendencies. The thought never would have crossed my mind.\n\nThis scenario wouldn\u2019t have happened in my family, though. If my sibling had delayed telling me upsetting news, my mom would have either not called my husband or she would have told him the news so he could tell me and shouldered the blame for letting the cat out of the bag. I know because that\u2019s exactly what she has done. And my husband didn\u2019t tell me while I was driving. He went out and bought ice cream, told me to be safe on the road, and then sat me down to give me the news when I got home.\n\nThe nature of the news has been described in the comments and seriously that\u2019s not news MIL should have shared. No one is sick, dying, or incarcerated. The brother simply wants to announce he is seeking help for mental health issues. Depending on the details and how it is delivered, he can spin that as good news. \n\nI agree with others saying that OP might have still been in trouble if he hadn\u2019t told his wife. She needs an outlet for her anger and he\u2019s the one who is there. She\u2019s not the AH though because she\u2019s not in a state of mind to think rationally.", "NTA - it definitely could have waited till she got home, but her reaction is not your responsibility, you were passing on info from her mom. You had to tell her one way or the other and you did so ASAP and as neutrally as possible. I would be upset if my partner kept something like that from me.\nIn the future, tell your MIL to reach out to her daughter herself instead of using you as a messenger, problem solved.", "NTA. Its obviously the MIL who is the AH. I would want my partner to give me that heads up for sure, its not so crazy to think you were acting out of your partners interest in telling them.\n\nI get your partner freaking out though, that is such a stressful thing to hear and I hate when people do that. Give her some grace, she was likely just directing her stress at you since she couldn't take it to her mom/ brother just yet.", "NTA. Your mother in law is though. She set you up in a lose/lose situation where you would have been TA if you said something or not. My bf and I would have done the same thing.", "NTA\n\nWhat a weird dynamics your wife's family have, why didn't they contact your wife directly? why they need to have a schedule to delivery bad news?", "YTA don't tell people shit news when they are driving long distances u dumbasssss", "NTA. There was absolutely no way you were gonna win this one. You told her, she got upset. If you didn't and something happened, she would be really mad at you for not letting her know as soon as you got the news.", "NTA. You had no good move here & it seems like you selected the option you felt was the lessor of two crappy choices.", "ESH except your wife. You should\u2019ve told your MIL that you weren\u2019t getting involved and that she needed to talk to your wife. Your MIL never should\u2019ve contacted you. John shouldn\u2019t be ignoring calls after saying he had some sort of distressing news. When someone has distressing news, they should just call with that news. It\u2019s not that hard.", "YTA for telling her that while she was driving home, why add anxiety to that situation?  Also your MIL is TA too for telling you but not telling you the news, she's just as bad.  She should have said \"brother is going to call tonight, let her know to expect the call\" and left it at that, and since she didn't, you should have.", "Soft YTA for not waiting until she got home. She was driving and distracted unnecessarily. \n\nThe real asshole though is the mother in law. Now yous are both stressing over bad news when yous don't even know what the bad news is. If she texted yous a few minutes before he arrived that would have been a nice heads up. This was way too much notice and way too much unnecessary stress", "NTA\nShe drastically overreacted and is using high school levels of social interaction. \n\nIf she was stressing, she should have just asked MIL, the whole \u201cdidn\u2019t want to ruin your credibility\u201d is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve heard. \n\nYou relayed news as you heard it and nothing more. Her reaction is over the top, and unjustified in her anger towards you.", "ESH. Including your MIL and BIL. You broke the news to your wife while she was driving alone which triggered an anxiety. Your wife makes it a big deal and makes it into an argument when she can hear you out first after she comes home. Your MIL / BIL for reaching out to you first instead of HER daughter / sibling. I mean i get the fact that you're part of the family but come on! You arent their immediate family! Your wife is!", "NTA.\n\nCurious as to why your wife\u2019s first thought was to search arrest records and not phone hospital admissions. My first thought for upsetting news would not be police related.", "YTA the etiquette is never to give news that could stress or cause anxiety to someone driving. You know that.", "NTA. That's your spouse, you should tell her. Your mil is ta for even mentioning it to you and expecting you not to tell your wife!", "NAH\n\nThe original message caused you unwarranted extra stress which then caused you to tell your wife, causing her unwarranted stress.\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if either they just came out with the full story in the first place, or simply said \"when she gets home, John wants to talk to her so have her give him a call.\"", "NTA - MIL should keep it to herself if she's not willing to say what the upsetting news is.", "YTA not for being honest, honesty is good, but for your timing here. \n\nNext time wait until your wife arrives home and then tell her face to face. She was calling family members and checking arrest records and out of her mind with worry when she should've been concentrating on the road. Lots of people die in car accidents. If the worst had happened you would spend your life blaming yourself. So next time just wait until you see her face to face and she is home safely.", "I don't know if YTA but you sure are the dum dum here. A well intended dum dum, I think, but dude- You didn't think this through.", "So what was the news?", "NTA\n\nWhy did she go to her brother being arrested?\n\nSounds like a drama family.", "NTA, but OP fell right into trap set by MIL. Mother shouldn\u2019t have been making any mysterious, inflammatory calls to anyone. There wasn\u2019t any urgent news to convey. If brother has something to tell his sister, that\u2019s his business. For what purpose did the MIL need to \u201cwarn\u201d her daughter\u2019s husband about something like that?  She was stirring the pot to create drama, and succeeded.", "100% agreed", "disagree on the timing complaint. This gave her the time so that she could try to get hold of them before she'd be home if she wanted. Especially without info of if it'd be time sensitive or not.", "I think you\u2019re 100% right. I\u2019m pretty straightforward and didn\u2019t see what the big deal was, but we have had a good conversation about it and I understand more how to handle anything like this in the future. Thanks!", "wtf, why is he the asshole and her mother isn't here?  He's the fucking middle man in this, and I'll be good and goddamned if I'm going to volunteer to be the arbiter of what messages my partner gets and what messages they don't.  \"Oh, hey, your mom called and left this message but I DECIDED you didn't need to get it right away because I know what's best for you, nyah!\"  \n\n\nFuuuuuuck no, gimme a message, I pass it on, I'm basically SIRI in this, no decision making employed or involved, do what the words say to do and nothing more.  \n\n\nBe mad at the mom, the husband did what he should have done and passed on the message he was given to pass on.", "Yep. But voting NAH.", "Isn't that on the wife's family? Why is it on him? He just relayed the news they told him. It's them who decided how much information to give and withhold.", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t they just bloody tell you the level of severity at least? It\u2019s still a poor idea to give someone bad news on the phone while driving, but with what they left you, you couldn\u2019t discern, so you pretty much had to say something in case time was relevant.", "And why looking through police records was the first thought. Lol", "The news was BIL was checking himself into a facility to get help for having suicidal thoughts. A couple years ago another sibling attempted suicide so it's an extra difficult topic for her family.", "Couldn't agree more, especially about the agency point. Who is OP to decide that his wife is unable to handle potentially upsetting news? Is she not an adult who can take responsibility for her own emotions?", "She looked through police records after being unable to get information from her family because she was concerned that someone had died or been injured. I'm not sure why that's bizarre or lol-worthy.", "I find this to be great news rather than upsetting. Good for him for getting help, knowing the genetics and family history at play. MIL sounds like a pot stirrer tbh, ratcheting up the drama. Sorry to say, but I wonder if that drama creating is part of the reason why her children have had a tough tome", "Actually, that is what ESH is for, even if you have to qualify it and say that the MIL and husband were AH.\n\nI think NTA for the husband although I understand why the wife was upset.  This was completely unfair from the MIL.  You can't say that you have bad news but I won't tell you until tomorrow.  That isn't on the husband.", "Well we don't know he's not affected.", "NTA. \n1) Your whole family needs to reassess what bad news is. Checking himself into a mental health facility voluntarily is HUGE good news. He knew his brain was lying to him and he did something about it. F off with the MIL framing it as \u201cbad news\u201d. She triggered the whole anxiety cascade for everyone. I hope your BIL is feeling better and has a good support system around him at college. \n2) If my partner had received a text like that and not told me? I\u2019d be pissed. You know your wife and how she would react, of course, but I wouldn\u2019t want information withheld from me.", "No doubt, thank you", "I sort of feel if he hadn\u2019t told her before the call she\u2019d be angry about that too (not to be awful - if it\u2019s bad news then she\u2019ll rightly be upset then may blame him for not alerting her first to prevent the blindside).  But it may have been a better idea to wait until she\u2019s home instead of driving. But I agree, the MIL is a AH.", "The conflict is between OP and his wife not OP and the MIL.", "It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t affected, it\u2019s that she is MORE affected. She is closer to the drama. She needs the support. If he needs support, too, he goes outside his circle. \n\nExample, I love my MIL. I speak to her more than her son does. When she dies (hopefully in decades), I will be heartbroken. But my husband will be MORE heartbroken. That\u2019s his mom. So I will support him. If I also need support, I\u2019ll call my sister or my work wife or literally any other friend. I don\u2019t put more on his plate by making him deal with my emotions. \n\nIf he was stressed or anxious or affected negatively, he needs to deal with it any other way than blurting it out to her while she was still driving.", "No, you can specify who the E refers to. That said, the wife is taking out her stress on her husband which isn't very fair", "And I disagree. Thats all \ud83d\ude09", "I think drama is your key word.", "That's a reasonable solution but this is reddit, a place for arguing and pendantry!\n\n/s just incase", "True."]}
