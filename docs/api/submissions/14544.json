On Sunday afternoon, my MIL texted me that John (21m - my wife\u2019s brother) would be calling that night when my wife got home from her trip. She also said \u201cHe has some upsetting news. I'm glad she will have you for support and l'll be home if she wants to call or FaceTime afterwards.\u201d I told my MIL that my wife had left later than expected and likely wouldn\u2019t be home until 11PM now and she said that John would call Monday evening instead. \n\nLater, my wife called from the car to check-in because she was still about 1.5-2 hours away and wanted a little break from her podcasts. I\u2019m not sure what in the conversation made me think of it, but I told her about the text from her mom earlier. She immediately started asking me what could be wrong, asked me to read the exact text, and was stressing out over it. She ended the call a few minutes later. \n\nWhen she got home, she was upset and angry at me for telling her. She didn\u2019t want to ruin my \u201ccredibility\u201d with her mom and family, so although she didn\u2019t tell them she knew there was something going on, she had reached out to both her mom and John to see if they wanted to talk while she was driving and her mom never responded to her text while her brother said he wasn\u2019t free. By the time she got home, she said she had already searched arrest records near his college as well as local newspaper sites and couldn\u2019t find anything about what this upsetting news could be.\n\nWe had a big argument about what I did. She thinks that I shouldn\u2019t have told her when I knew they\u2019d be calling the next evening after her work day was over, and that I especially shouldn\u2019t have told her when she was alone in the car driving. I thought I was doing the right thing by not keeping secrets from her.

It was a no-win scenario for you.\n\nETA- typo", " NTA - your MIL is. Thats beyond annoying to call you up and say your BIL will be calling with info. Why just not wait for BIL to call? Your wife should be mad at your MIL for this, not you.", "NTA - Your MIL put you in a no win situation.

You unfairly triggered anxiety and worry that was unnecessary.  There are times when secrets are appropriate.\n\nEdit: so a lot of people seem to disagree with me, but go back and read the original post. It\u2019s pretty clear that the wife is a worrier. The OP should have been very aware of this personality trait. So yeah, I\u2019m standing by the YTA and yes, the MIL is just as guilty.", "NTA for giving her a heads up but soft y t a for the timing. Telling her when she got home would\u2019ve been a better play just so she\u2019s not on the road distracted/ stressed out/ panicking. It could\u2019ve waited the 2 hours. \n\nTelling her that bad news is coming is ok though. Her mom warned you I\u2019m advance so it stands to reason that you could pass on the warning. I definitely think your wife over reacted and went I to panic mode\u2026 if she is a chronic over thinker and/or gets stressed easily you prob should\u2019ve taken that into consideration before telling her. You should know her well enough to know these things.", "NTA.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t told her, and then later she finds out that her mother told you bad news was coming BUT you didn\u2019t tell her, you\u2019d have been in trouble for keeping things from her.\n\nIt was a rotten situation for you to be in and I soft side-eye your MIL for putting you in the middle.", "NTA I'm all for the truth, although I want to know what the upsetting news is, can't even imagine how she felt", "Nta.

Not yr fault.", "i'm going with NAH. your MIL told you it was upsetting and that your wife might need support. maybe she wanted both of you to be prepared, either because your wife is sensitive or john is sensitive and she wanted you to approach the facetime that way. all you did was relay the information given to you, knowing your wife would be home soon. obviously, whatever it was could wait another day. \n\nnow, if you know your wife is the type to easily go into an anxiety spiral, that's on you. but it seems like it would be weird for you to keep this secret with your MIL about your wife's brother.", "NTA sorry dude.

There was no good solution here, except avoiding her calls while she was on her way. And that would made her feel worried as well.", "NTA- MiL is the AH kinda here. You are allowed to have your own anxiety and feelings around this being dropped on you, and naturally you turned to your wife to tell her what had happened.", "I can't believe the number of people calling you TA; no doubt you were in an unwinnable position but this is on your MIL. After reading through your comments, I see that the \"bad news\" was wife's brother was having a mental health crisis and checked himself into treatment.  Isn't that \"good news\"?

That would definitely stress your wife and probably have her freaking out the entire time. It sucks to know \\~something\\~ bad has happened without knowing what.\n\nWas there any inkling of what it could be? I mean, your wife could have thought there was a death in her family or something, which would understandably freak her out and she probably wouldn't be able to chill until she knew what was up. \n\nYour MIL was super cryptic to tell you what she did without explaining the situation- like, what's the point of that? It also puts you in a weird position where you know something is up, and don't want to lie/pretend to your wife that everything is good when you get a message like that.\n\nAll in all, your MIL was probably the worst offender and should have just told your wife from the beginning and not have told you something cryptic. I can see why your wife would be upset and stressed when she only has 'something terrible has happened' to go on. And I think you were just caught in the middle of it.\n\nIt's best practice to just tell people the bad news, and not say 'something' bad has happened to leave people to freak out about what it could possibly be. Either say the whole story or don't say anything at all.", "Soft YTA, even though you didn't intend it.\n\nTelling her while she was driving would OBVIOUSLY stress her out hugely and result in a lot of worry on her part. It could even have reduced her focus to drive safely.\n\nYou were thoughtless to blurt out something like that Egypt she was driving home.", "Meh yta but unintentionally.\n\nYou knew she wasn't going to be told until she got home and it's obviously not something so critical that it constitutes and emergency (seeing as how your BIL and MIL are both able to use their phones to call and text) so you probably should have used your critical thinking and realised it would do nothing but ruin her drive.", "YTA. You put her in a cloud of worry for an entire day. You told her while she was alone when you'd been told she would need support.", "Soft YTA. There are times to keep a secret and times you shouldn't. This is one of the times you should have kept it.", "You and MIL are both the AH. First MIL for stressing you out with this ominous warning, and then you for stressing your wife out. I hate when i know there is bad news, but i don't know what it is. I imagine the worst possible things. Hope it's not as bad as MIL made it sound!", "Soft YTA. Obviously you didn\u2019t intend harm. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s pretty shitty to say \u201chey btw you\u2019re gonna get a call in a few hours with some terrible news that I\u2019m not going to say anything about\u2026k bye!\u201d Like that\u2019s really not cool. There\u2019s no point in stressing someone out when they can\u2019t do anything about it.  Sometimes it\u2019s best to just not say anything and wait.", "NTA. Maybe your MIL shouldn\u2019t have gave you a warning that bad news was coming I feel like that\u2019s one of the worst things you can do because it can fuel anxiety and overthinking, but I can understand if she did this because she wanted to make sure your wife was home to support you. I think you also might have fueled some anxiety in your wife but I can understand you did it to prevent keeping secrets. NTA but I think you two should talk and you can explain to her that you did it to avoid keeping secrets (if that was the cases),", "Soft YTA  I don't think your MIL should have said \"they had some upsetting news\" if she wasn't willing to tell you what it was.  That being said you should not have told your wife until she was safely home, and even then perhaps waited until her brother called since you literally had no useful information.  I was on a long awaited vacation to a pretty inaccessible place one time, and  my mother wanted the SAT phone number in case something happened.  I gave it to her, but told her since I can't get home any sooner that is planned, please don't call me with bad news.  There will be absolutely nothing I can do about it until I get home, and I would rather my vacation wasn't ruined.  Maybe this makes me selfish, but oh well.", "This is perspective but I want to sayNTA. I had a trip overseas with friends and on the second night into a 10 day trip my parent was in the hospital. They called me a day later contemplating if they should tell me and I\u2019m glad they did. I was anxious and sad but I could never shoot the messenger. I think his wife needs to keep herself in check too. If it was urgent they would\u2019ve called her directly. Patience is necessary too.", "Soft yta. There was nothing she could do from where she was at, so why add the stress? When my niece passed away I was at rehearsal, which ends late in the evening. My husband didn't say anything till i had safely commuted home because he knew if I knew i wouldn't be able to cycle safely. That's the way to go with bad news that cant be helped.", "Soft YTA for OP but op\u2019s mother in law is a giant asshole. Telling someone you\u2019re going to give them bad news in the future is psychological torture because the person anticipating it is going to imagine every worst case scenario.", "YTA what did you hope to accomplish with that? You put her in a worry all day while she was in a position where not only she didn\u2019t know what the news was, she couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation. It could have waited until she came home", "NTA. Your wife is responsible for her own actions (distracted driving) and managing her own emotions.", "YTA, both your and your MIL but you just a little less since MIL put you in a bad position. This business of giving people a head's up about anything, good or bad, when they're not ready to spill (cough-my sister-cough) is one of my biggest pet peeves.

If the amount of time you'd be \"keeping it from her\" was less than one day, and the reason for waiting was that she'd have support and would get actual specifics from her brother instead of whatever nightmare scenario her brain can create from the vagueness, then it's actually a good thing for you to take on that *temporary* tension over the lack of transparency, because it's a way for you to take care of your partner.", "Now I just want to know what the upsetting news is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\nIf you hadn't told her, she would have been upset that you hadn't told her.", "YTA you seem to have really poor instincts", "NTA.

Block MIL and brother and let your wife be the one who speaks to them from now on since they are subjecting you to this idiocy.", "Not saying anything until she can actually get the call and figure out what is going on is how you \u201cwin\u201d this situation. Keeping your mouth shut and not stressing someone out further is actually quite simple. She\u2019s going to get the news no matter what, telling her about it beforehand without offering any other information is an unnecessary and shitty thing to do.", "Why are we assuming that this was *only* stressful for OP\u2019s wife and not also for OP?? If my MIL called me and said that my husband would getting some upsetting news but would tell me what it was, I\u2019d be concerned/freaking out, too. It\u2019s ok that MIL did it to OP but not that OP relayed this to his wife?", "That's what the MIL did though. She didn't have to tell that the brother was calling with bad news. She then put the husband in the no win situation of either telling the truth or keeping things from his wife, which she likely would've gotten mad about too. \n\nAnd while it sucks to have anxiety while you are waiting for it, at least the wife won't be blindsided whenever the bad news comes.", "I sort of just went through this. MIL is out of the country. One of her kids emailed saying she needed to talk\u2026in 18 hours and then went radio silent. \n\nI woke up to about 6 messages in 3 different mediums, some with my husband on them some without, begging for info because she was terrified a grandkid or child was dying/dead. I ended up giving her the broad strokes, because while it was bad news and not mine to share, I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of her panicking for another 10 hours. \n\nFor everyone out there, this is a terrible way to set up a call to deliver bad news. Don\u2019t do it. And if someone is doing it anyways, don\u2019t make it worse. Now, did I know beforehand that bad news was a-coming?  Yep, but I also knew that it wasn\u2019t going to come any faster if I warned her 48 hours earlier - I would just cause her undue stress - and so I did the N T A thing and kept my mouth shut", "If my partner withheld such a text from me, I'd regard it as a huge betrayal.

And then I'd rip a strip off my mother for having put OP in that position.\n\n~~Gonna guess that MIL has a record of shit stirring and her daughter is conditioned to see it as normal, and is unable/unwilling to confront her over this behavior.~~\n\nBut again, if my partner knows about something that will impact me significantly and withholds that info, that's a serious fucking problem.\n\nIn my mind it's acting in a high handed manner and not permitting me full agency over my life.\n\nOP did nothing wrong. ~~MIL is toxic as fuck.~~\n\nEdit: see my response to OP below.", "Truth without tact is often just cruelty.", "I don't even think you could count this as technically a secret, more like a delayed conversation. \nYeah soft YTA, she's driving and couldn't really do anything but worry constantly, letting the unknown build and build and build.", "MIL probably let OP know that the bed would be upsetting so he could ensure he was with his wife to provide support when that call happened.\n\nBut yeah I agree with you on everything else.", "Right! And then the MIL didn't even tell him what the bad news was so he could make an educated decision on whether it was something he immediately needed to relay to his wife or not so she could then react accordingly.

Why did you say something that would worry your wife while she was driving alone? Just FYI, you increased her risk of an accident by doing so. You were informed that she'd likely need support and instead of playing the supporting role, you actually made things much worse.

Her job was get home safely, then could discuss it with OP.

The thought never would have crossed my mind.\n\nThis scenario wouldn\u2019t have happened in my family, though. If my sibling had delayed telling me upsetting news, my mom would have either not called my husband or she would have told him the news so he could tell me and shouldered the blame for letting the cat out of the bag. I know because that\u2019s exactly what she has done. And my husband didn\u2019t tell me while I was driving. He went out and bought ice cream, told me to be safe on the road, and then sat me down to give me the news when I got home.\n\nThe nature of the news has been described in the comments and seriously that\u2019s not news MIL should have shared. No one is sick, dying, or incarcerated. The brother simply wants to announce he is seeking help for mental health issues. Depending on the details and how it is delivered, he can spin that as good news. \n\nI agree with others saying that OP might have still been in trouble if he hadn\u2019t told his wife.

Mother shouldn\u2019t have been making any mysterious, inflammatory calls to anyone. There wasn\u2019t any urgent news to convey.

Why didn\u2019t they just bloody tell you the level of severity at least? It\u2019s still a poor idea to give someone bad news on the phone while driving, but with what they left you, you couldn\u2019t discern, so you pretty much had to say something in case time was relevant.", "And why looking through police records was the first thought. Lol", "The news was BIL was checking himself into a facility to get help for having suicidal thoughts. A couple years ago another sibling attempted suicide so it's an extra difficult topic for her family.", "Couldn't agree more, especially about the agency point. Who is OP to decide that his wife is unable to handle potentially upsetting news?

I'm not sure why that's bizarre or lol-worthy.", "I find this to be great news rather than upsetting. Good for him for getting help, knowing the genetics and family history at play.

That isn't on the husband.", "Well we don't know he's not affected.", "NTA. \n1) Your whole family needs to reassess what bad news is. Checking himself into a mental health facility voluntarily is HUGE good news. He knew his brain was lying to him and he did something about it. F off with the MIL framing it as \u201cbad news\u201d. She triggered the whole anxiety cascade for everyone. I hope your BIL is feeling better and has a good support system around him at college. \n2) If my partner had received a text like that and not told me? I\u2019d be pissed.

When she dies (hopefully in decades), I will be heartbroken. But my husband will be MORE heartbroken. That\u2019s his mom. So I will support him. If I also need support, I\u2019ll call my sister or my work wife or literally any other friend.

She'd prefer you hadn't done so, and she's extremely stressed and afraid and you're likely taking some of the shrapnel from that.  She's reacting more extremely to something that isn't gigantic, because it's part of this entire stressful thing.\n\nI think that it could be useful in the future, bc now maybe you guys can actually say out loud, \"hey, if this happens again in the future, here's what I'd want you to do\".\n\nI think we tend to act based upon what we would most want to happen in that situation: literally doing unto others what we'd want them to do!  So like when something bad happens, I absolutely want to know about it, I want all of the details, unsugarcoated, because it helps me feel more in control and able to prepare.

MIL was trying to be helpful, but nobody should be announcing bad news hours or days before the actual bad news is going to be delivered. It's just panic inducing all around.", "Idk this sounds like shit my spouse and I do to each other all the time... \nWe don't really get in a tizzy about it though. We might be a bit desensitized to shit news ... \n\nI'd absolutely do as OP wife did, make the calls and try to get in touch. But be mad at him about it? Nah. Thanks for the heads up. We're both on the same page & can brace for impact, together.", "I would say that MIL could possibly have wanted to prepare her daughter. If I were op, I would've said, \"Hey honey, I wanted to warn you that your Mom informed me that you may be receiving some bad news on this phone call. The good news is, I'm here for you, I love you, and whatever it is we'll get through this together\" and that'd IMMEDIATELY precede the phone call. No way should it have been conveyed in this manner, nor so damn early! My anxious ass would be vomiting from the situation.", "I mean, there is bad news that I would want to know immediately. Like if someone died or was critically injured.  Them saying it could wait meant it wasn\u2019t good news but not like REALLY terrible news. MIL should have just not said anything geez.", "Seriously! This is like \u2018concerning\u2019 but not \u2018bad\u2019. Bad is someone died or got terribly hurt. I know the family has trauma about this sort of thing but at least brother did himself the right thing by going in. MILs I swear.", "Especially since BIL had a failed suicide attempt 2 years ago. Like, op, read the room. Don't tell your wife: *\"upsetting news is coming from your mom and brother, but idk what. Ok bye have a nice long car ride alone thinking about that!\"* Like???\n\nEven if MIL shouldn't have done the same thing to op, that doesn't mean that op isn't TA for also doing it to his wife. Especially since he knows their past and knows how worried she would be. She is also way more affected by this too.\n\nESH except for op's wife. Op and MIL suck for how they handled this situation.", "The brother attempted for what I garnered", "This is the sort of news that they probably didn\u2019t need to break at all. They could have also told her in person. I\u2019m sorry op you shouldn\u2019t have been dragged into this. If they wanted you to keep a secret at least tell you what the heck it is. Man, family drama..", "Being stressed doesn\u2019t mean you need to instantly dump that stress on your parents.", "As I see... MIL told him that because she wanted to make sure OP knew to stay around to support her daughter after the bad news. Telling him to not leave the house around that time and be prepared to deal with the wife getting the news.\n\nWhat she probably didn't image is OP having the emotional maturity of a tortoise... and telling the wife that.", "i agree the mother is also an AH but OP was a bigger AH for telling his wife this while she was alone and driving, after her mother had expressed to him that she (the wife) would need his support when she heard this upsetting news.\n\nIf I had been OP I would've been pissed off that MIL expects me to sit on this till the following evening, and I probably would've also told her about it ahead of time, but I would not have told her when she was alone in the car so she would have to still drive 1-2 hrs alone at night freaking out all by herself. That is why he's the big AH, in my opinion. At least wait till she gets home.", "That\u2019s not bad news that\u2019s good news that BIL getting the help he needs.", "Her brother had a failed suicide attempt 2 years ago. She probably thought her brother was dead. \n\nDoesn't seem like an overreaction to me.", "but OP should absolutely not have told his wife there's bad news coming, not while she was alone driving, and would need to wait a whole day to find out what it was. \n\nThe MIL is an AH for putting OP in this position but OP is a bigger AH for freaking his wife out like that. At the very least he should've waited till she got home (then he'd be less of an AH). His MIL already expressed that OP's wife would need his support whenever she received this bad news, how does sending her into a panic when she's all alone and driving make any sense?", "No, OP is 100% grade A AH.\n\nYou do NOT tellsomeone \"Hey btw you're gonna get bad news but I can't tell you what it is\" WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING.\n\nThat's the best way to get a person to worry themselves into hysterics and potentially cause a wreck! OP is a complete AH, he could've said that when was home and NOT behind the wheel. It's common sense", "Yeah I think sometimes people get so wrapped up in an upsetting thing that they forget other people won't magically know where on the scale of upsetting things it is.\n\nPersonally if I'm telling someone upsetting I lead with establishing what's fine and what isn't, starting with stuff they're going to care about more.\n\n\"Hey mom, I'm fine and I'm in a safe place. The car is not fine. Now I can either explain what happened or get some quick information and call you back because you're not worried I'm calling from a hospital or jail or something.\"", "Yeah, our family has a \"call me its not an energency\" or a \"911\" text message. 911 was used when my grandmother went into the hospital unconscious when I was 2 hrs away and my bro was 15 mins away and my bro wouldn't answer his phone. His wife called me back immediately.", "What the fuck is wrong with you", "Maybe. Seems like she\u2019s blaming her partner for her emotions and reactions to them which were caused by her mother which was caused by her brother. He\u2019s unfortunately in the middle. Maybe he should\u2019ve not said anything, but I think that could also cause a problem. Time to set boundary\u2019s with the in laws\u2026", "Wrong with me, for... watching families only get concerned after a very dangerous thing happens and not giving a shit about anyone until after the fact? Not building good communities and sewing the seeds of suicide in their children, wow.  What the fuck is wrong with YOU?", "But it's more fun to play devils advocate every now and then.\n\nEvery now and then when people actually ask for further info instead of  joining into the hive mind. The new info can completely swing the vote or change the situation.\n\nI love those posts, cause its like watching those posts because when people realise it's like watching a swarm of piranhas. They could be happily swimming around, but once one piranha realises there is prey the entire swarm attacks."]}
