On Sunday afternoon, my MIL texted me that John (21m - my wife\u2019s brother) would be calling that night when my wife got home from her trip. She also said \u201cHe has some upsetting news. I'm glad she will have you for support and l'll be home if she wants to call or FaceTime afterwards.\u201d I told my MIL that my wife had left later than expected and likely wouldn\u2019t be home until 11PM now and she said that John would call Monday evening instead. \n\nLater, my wife called from the car to check-in because she was still about 1.5-2 hours away and wanted a little break from her podcasts. I\u2019m not sure what in the conversation made me think of it, but I told her about the text from her mom earlier. She immediately started asking me what could be wrong, asked me to read the exact text, and was stressing out over it. She ended the call a few minutes later. \n\nWhen she got home, she was upset and angry at me for telling her. She didn\u2019t want to ruin my \u201ccredibility\u201d with her mom and family, so although she didn\u2019t tell them she knew there was something going on, she had reached out to both her mom and John to see if they wanted to talk while she was driving and her mom never responded to her text while her brother said he wasn\u2019t free. By the time she got home, she said she had already searched arrest records near his college as well as local newspaper sites and couldn\u2019t find anything about what this upsetting news could be.\n\nWe had a big argument about what I did. She thinks that I shouldn\u2019t have told her when I knew they\u2019d be calling the next evening after her work day was over, and that I especially shouldn\u2019t have told her when she was alone in the car driving. I thought I was doing the right thing by not keeping secrets from her.

Your wife should be mad at your MIL for this, not you.", "NTA - Your MIL put you in a no win situation.

You unfairly triggered anxiety and worry that was unnecessary.  There are times when secrets are appropriate.\n\nEdit: so a lot of people seem to disagree with me, but go back and read the original post. It\u2019s pretty clear that the wife is a worrier. The OP should have been very aware of this personality trait. So yeah, I\u2019m standing by the YTA and yes, the MIL is just as guilty.", "NTA for giving her a heads up but soft y t a for the timing. Telling her when she got home would\u2019ve been a better play just so she\u2019s not on the road distracted/ stressed out/ panicking. It could\u2019ve waited the 2 hours. \n\nTelling her that bad news is coming is ok though. Her mom warned you I\u2019m advance so it stands to reason that you could pass on the warning. I definitely think your wife over reacted and went I to panic mode\u2026 if she is a chronic over thinker and/or gets stressed easily you prob should\u2019ve taken that into consideration before telling her. You should know her well enough to know these things.", "NTA.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t told her, and then later she finds out that her mother told you bad news was coming BUT you didn\u2019t tell her, you\u2019d have been in trouble for keeping things from her.\n\nIt was a rotten situation for you to be in and I soft side-eye your MIL for putting you in the middle.", "NTA I'm all for the truth, although I want to know what the upsetting news is, can't even imagine how she felt", "Nta.

Not yr fault.", "i'm going with NAH. your MIL told you it was upsetting and that your wife might need support. maybe she wanted both of you to be prepared, either because your wife is sensitive or john is sensitive and she wanted you to approach the facetime that way. all you did was relay the information given to you, knowing your wife would be home soon. obviously, whatever it was could wait another day. \n\nnow, if you know your wife is the type to easily go into an anxiety spiral, that's on you. but it seems like it would be weird for you to keep this secret with your MIL about your wife's brother.", "NTA sorry dude.

You are allowed to have your own anxiety and feelings around this being dropped on you, and naturally you turned to your wife to tell her what had happened.", "I can't believe the number of people calling you TA; no doubt you were in an unwinnable position but this is on your MIL. After reading through your comments, I see that the \"bad news\" was wife's brother was having a mental health crisis and checked himself into treatment.  Isn't that \"good news\"?

That would definitely stress your wife and probably have her freaking out the entire time. It sucks to know \\~something\\~ bad has happened without knowing what.\n\nWas there any inkling of what it could be? I mean, your wife could have thought there was a death in her family or something, which would understandably freak her out and she probably wouldn't be able to chill until she knew what was up. \n\nYour MIL was super cryptic to tell you what she did without explaining the situation- like, what's the point of that? It also puts you in a weird position where you know something is up, and don't want to lie/pretend to your wife that everything is good when you get a message like that.\n\nAll in all, your MIL was probably the worst offender and should have just told your wife from the beginning and not have told you something cryptic. I can see why your wife would be upset and stressed when she only has 'something terrible has happened' to go on. And I think you were just caught in the middle of it.\n\nIt's best practice to just tell people the bad news, and not say 'something' bad has happened to leave people to freak out about what it could possibly be. Either say the whole story or don't say anything at all.", "Soft YTA, even though you didn't intend it.\n\nTelling her while she was driving would OBVIOUSLY stress her out hugely and result in a lot of worry on her part. It could even have reduced her focus to drive safely.\n\nYou were thoughtless to blurt out something like that Egypt she was driving home.", "Meh yta but unintentionally.\n\nYou knew she wasn't going to be told until she got home and it's obviously not something so critical that it constitutes and emergency (seeing as how your BIL and MIL are both able to use their phones to call and text) so you probably should have used your critical thinking and realised it would do nothing but ruin her drive.", "YTA. You put her in a cloud of worry for an entire day. You told her while she was alone when you'd been told she would need support.", "Soft YTA. There are times to keep a secret and times you shouldn't. This is one of the times you should have kept it.", "You and MIL are both the AH. First MIL for stressing you out with this ominous warning, and then you for stressing your wife out. I hate when i know there is bad news, but i don't know what it is. I imagine the worst possible things. Hope it's not as bad as MIL made it sound!", "Soft YTA. Obviously you didn\u2019t intend harm. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s pretty shitty to say \u201chey btw you\u2019re gonna get a call in a few hours with some terrible news that I\u2019m not going to say anything about\u2026k bye!\u201d Like that\u2019s really not cool. There\u2019s no point in stressing someone out when they can\u2019t do anything about it.  Sometimes it\u2019s best to just not say anything and wait.", "NTA. Maybe your MIL shouldn\u2019t have gave you a warning that bad news was coming I feel like that\u2019s one of the worst things you can do because it can fuel anxiety and overthinking, but I can understand if she did this because she wanted to make sure your wife was home to support you. I think you also might have fueled some anxiety in your wife but I can understand you did it to prevent keeping secrets. NTA but I think you two should talk and you can explain to her that you did it to avoid keeping secrets (if that was the cases),", "Soft YTA  I don't think your MIL should have said \"they had some upsetting news\" if she wasn't willing to tell you what it was.  That being said you should not have told your wife until she was safely home, and even then perhaps waited until her brother called since you literally had no useful information.  I was on a long awaited vacation to a pretty inaccessible place one time, and  my mother wanted the SAT phone number in case something happened.  I gave it to her, but told her since I can't get home any sooner that is planned, please don't call me with bad news.  There will be absolutely nothing I can do about it until I get home, and I would rather my vacation wasn't ruined.  Maybe this makes me selfish, but oh well.", "This is perspective but I want to sayNTA. I had a trip overseas with friends and on the second night into a 10 day trip my parent was in the hospital. They called me a day later contemplating if they should tell me and I\u2019m glad they did. I was anxious and sad but I could never shoot the messenger. I think his wife needs to keep herself in check too. If it was urgent they would\u2019ve called her directly. Patience is necessary too.", "Soft yta. There was nothing she could do from where she was at, so why add the stress? When my niece passed away I was at rehearsal, which ends late in the evening. My husband didn't say anything till i had safely commuted home because he knew if I knew i wouldn't be able to cycle safely. That's the way to go with bad news that cant be helped.", "Soft YTA for OP but op\u2019s mother in law is a giant asshole. Telling someone you\u2019re going to give them bad news in the future is psychological torture because the person anticipating it is going to imagine every worst case scenario.", "YTA what did you hope to accomplish with that? You put her in a worry all day while she was in a position where not only she didn\u2019t know what the news was, she couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation. It could have waited until she came home", "NTA. Your wife is responsible for her own actions (distracted driving) and managing her own emotions.", "YTA, both your and your MIL but you just a little less since MIL put you in a bad position. This business of giving people a head's up about anything, good or bad, when they're not ready to spill (cough-my sister-cough) is one of my biggest pet peeves.

If the amount of time you'd be \"keeping it from her\" was less than one day, and the reason for waiting was that she'd have support and would get actual specifics from her brother instead of whatever nightmare scenario her brain can create from the vagueness, then it's actually a good thing for you to take on that *temporary* tension over the lack of transparency, because it's a way for you to take care of your partner.", "Now I just want to know what the upsetting news is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\nIf you hadn't told her, she would have been upset that you hadn't told her.", "YTA you seem to have really poor instincts", "NTA.

Block MIL and brother and let your wife be the one who speaks to them from now on since they are subjecting you to this idiocy.", "Not saying anything until she can actually get the call and figure out what is going on is how you \u201cwin\u201d this situation. Keeping your mouth shut and not stressing someone out further is actually quite simple. She\u2019s going to get the news no matter what, telling her about it beforehand without offering any other information is an unnecessary and shitty thing to do.", "Why are we assuming that this was *only* stressful for OP\u2019s wife and not also for OP?? If my MIL called me and said that my husband would getting some upsetting news but would tell me what it was, I\u2019d be concerned/freaking out, too. It\u2019s ok that MIL did it to OP but not that OP relayed this to his wife?", "That's what the MIL did though. She didn't have to tell that the brother was calling with bad news. She then put the husband in the no win situation of either telling the truth or keeping things from his wife, which she likely would've gotten mad about too. \n\nAnd while it sucks to have anxiety while you are waiting for it, at least the wife won't be blindsided whenever the bad news comes.", "I sort of just went through this. MIL is out of the country. One of her kids emailed saying she needed to talk\u2026in 18 hours and then went radio silent. \n\nI woke up to about 6 messages in 3 different mediums, some with my husband on them some without, begging for info because she was terrified a grandkid or child was dying/dead. I ended up giving her the broad strokes, because while it was bad news and not mine to share, I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of her panicking for another 10 hours. \n\nFor everyone out there, this is a terrible way to set up a call to deliver bad news. Don\u2019t do it. And if someone is doing it anyways, don\u2019t make it worse. Now, did I know beforehand that bad news was a-coming?  Yep, but I also knew that it wasn\u2019t going to come any faster if I warned her 48 hours earlier - I would just cause her undue stress - and so I did the N T A thing and kept my mouth shut", "If my partner withheld such a text from me, I'd regard it as a huge betrayal.

And then I'd rip a strip off my mother for having put OP in that position.\n\n~~Gonna guess that MIL has a record of shit stirring and her daughter is conditioned to see it as normal, and is unable/unwilling to confront her over this behavior.~~\n\nBut again, if my partner knows about something that will impact me significantly and withholds that info, that's a serious fucking problem.\n\nIn my mind it's acting in a high handed manner and not permitting me full agency over my life.\n\nOP did nothing wrong. ~~MIL is toxic as fuck.~~\n\nEdit: see my response to OP below.", "Truth without tact is often just cruelty.", "I don't even think you could count this as technically a secret, more like a delayed conversation. \nYeah soft YTA, she's driving and couldn't really do anything but worry constantly, letting the unknown build and build and build.", "MIL probably let OP know that the bed would be upsetting so he could ensure he was with his wife to provide support when that call happened.\n\nBut yeah I agree with you on everything else.", "Right! And then the MIL didn't even tell him what the bad news was so he could make an educated decision on whether it was something he immediately needed to relay to his wife or not so she could then react accordingly.

Why did you say something that would worry your wife while she was driving alone? Just FYI, you increased her risk of an accident by doing so. You were informed that she'd likely need support and instead of playing the supporting role, you actually made things much worse.

Her job was get home safely, then could discuss it with OP.

The thought never would have crossed my mind.\n\nThis scenario wouldn\u2019t have happened in my family, though. If my sibling had delayed telling me upsetting news, my mom would have either not called my husband or she would have told him the news so he could tell me and shouldered the blame for letting the cat out of the bag. I know because that\u2019s exactly what she has done. And my husband didn\u2019t tell me while I was driving. He went out and bought ice cream, told me to be safe on the road, and then sat me down to give me the news when I got home.\n\nThe nature of the news has been described in the comments and seriously that\u2019s not news MIL should have shared. No one is sick, dying, or incarcerated. The brother simply wants to announce he is seeking help for mental health issues. Depending on the details and how it is delivered, he can spin that as good news. \n\nI agree with others saying that OP might have still been in trouble if he hadn\u2019t told his wife.

Mother shouldn\u2019t have been making any mysterious, inflammatory calls to anyone. There wasn\u2019t any urgent news to convey.

Why didn\u2019t they just bloody tell you the level of severity at least? It\u2019s still a poor idea to give someone bad news on the phone while driving, but with what they left you, you couldn\u2019t discern, so you pretty much had to say something in case time was relevant.", "And why looking through police records was the first thought. Lol", "The news was BIL was checking himself into a facility to get help for having suicidal thoughts. A couple years ago another sibling attempted suicide so it's an extra difficult topic for her family.", "Couldn't agree more, especially about the agency point. Who is OP to decide that his wife is unable to handle potentially upsetting news?

I'm not sure why that's bizarre or lol-worthy.", "I find this to be great news rather than upsetting. Good for him for getting help, knowing the genetics and family history at play.

That isn't on the husband.", "Well we don't know he's not affected.", "NTA. \n1) Your whole family needs to reassess what bad news is. Checking himself into a mental health facility voluntarily is HUGE good news. He knew his brain was lying to him and he did something about it. F off with the MIL framing it as \u201cbad news\u201d. She triggered the whole anxiety cascade for everyone. I hope your BIL is feeling better and has a good support system around him at college. \n2) If my partner had received a text like that and not told me? I\u2019d be pissed.

When she dies (hopefully in decades), I will be heartbroken. But my husband will be MORE heartbroken. That\u2019s his mom. So I will support him. If I also need support, I\u2019ll call my sister or my work wife or literally any other friend.

She'd prefer you hadn't done so, and she's extremely stressed and afraid and you're likely taking some of the shrapnel from that.  She's reacting more extremely to something that isn't gigantic, because it's part of this entire stressful thing.\n\nI think that it could be useful in the future, bc now maybe you guys can actually say out loud, \"hey, if this happens again in the future, here's what I'd want you to do\".\n\nI think we tend to act based upon what we would most want to happen in that situation: literally doing unto others what we'd want them to do!  So like when something bad happens, I absolutely want to know about it, I want all of the details, unsugarcoated, because it helps me feel more in control and able to prepare.

I got home from work and my fiancee told me I should call my parents.

When I told her I'd call in a couple days, she said, \"It's about your dad. You should call.\"\n\nMy parents had been having some spats recently so my first thought was divorce. But, I wasn't really excited about the prospect of calling an hour before bed after a long workday to sit through that kind of conversation. I hadn't even eaten yet. Again, I said I'd call in a couple of days. \n\nShe pushed a little harder this time, so I finally relented and called. Turns out dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Caught it early, and they live near Brigham and Women's so it's not a huge deal overall. Wouldn't be the first time he survived cancer either.\n\nHe was even surprised I called to ask what was going on. Apparently mom and my fiancee had talked about it earlier that day and decided I should call that night. But he clearly understood the prognosis and the treatment plan, and that there was little to be worried about at this point. \n\nHe and I were both a little annoyed that it was made into such a big deal so late on a work night (he's not retired yet).\n\nSo I can see both sides here and I'm going to say there's no AH in this situation. Whatever it is, it's enough for MIL to be worried and want to give you the heads up. Whether that's unfounded or not remains to be seen.

Granted, it could probably have been done more tactfully, but I don't know enough about your relationship to know whether you share these things with each other immediately or let them lie until the actual news is known, so I can't really judge that decision other than saying it could probably have been handled more delicately/patiently.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n>She also said \u201cHe has some upsetting news.

Couldn't she have just let it happen? if it was so worrying, why not just tell the husband so he can tell her when she gets home?", "YTA. Simply because she was alone and driving. Telling her before she got home achieved nothing but making her worry and splitting her focus. Those 2 hours of ignorant bliss wouldn't have hurt anyone but you. They put you in a nasty, stressful situation.", "NTA", "NTA, you did what your MIL asked you to do.", "You\u2019re way off base.  The husband was clearly trying to forewarn the wife of impending bad news, nothing nefarious.  The wife could\u2019ve just as easily displaced her stress on the husband all the same if she found he was keeping secrets.  It was a no win scenario.  You don\u2019t get to dictate how people should negotiate tragedy/ misfortune.", "So, you\u2019re saying that OP shouldn\u2019t have told his wife, and that he should have let her get this as a surprise, and also then get the backlash from all of his in-laws because MIL is going to say \u201cI asked him to tell you about this in advance. He\u2019s keeping secrets\u201d etc? \n\nOP was put in an impossible predicament here. NTA. OP did as his wife\u2019s mother (a person that should always have her families interests at heart, and know how they\u2019ll react to any given situation) asked of him. If he hadn\u2019t, he would have possibly had far worse fallout for going against wife\u2019s families wishes, and being accused of lying/keeping secrets. OP didn\u2019t create this situation. OP\u2019s wife knows that\u2019s the case too. Is it right that we yell at our partners for doing what is asked of them by our family? Surely talking about issues is better?  Why does wife get a free pass for this behaviour? \n\nNTA.", "Why tell the husband though? Why not, when the call comes through, suggest \u201chey I have some upsetting news, you might want to keep your husband nearby for emotional support\u201d\u2013 heck, the MIL even said _she_ would be available for emotional support. \n\n>\u201dI\u2019m glad she will have you for support\u2026\n\nSprings him into the role. Maybe he finishes later than his wife, maybe he\u2019ll be getting home later on that day.\n\n>\u201dI\u2019ll be home all day if she wants to call or Facetime afterwards.\u201d\n\nWhy bring the husband into the mix then??? If she\u2019s offering herself up for emotional support, why also OP? I get it, broaden the network, but essentially forcing OP make himself available when there\u2019s an option already doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. I\u2019d reckon the wife is perfectly capable of ringing OP/texting OP and saying \u201cI just received bad news, and I want your emotional support\u201d or going to her mother for the initial fallout and then going to OP afterwards.\n\nSorta sounds like, to me, the MIL doesn\u2019t want to deal with her daughter\u2019s initial reaction, and is making OP do that in her place.", "Also, if OP had forgotten, then he would have been the bad guy for not warning her. Honestly, I say NTA, cause this was probably a no-win situation for OP. OP passed on a message while he remembered it.", "'A huge betrayal'? Seriously? It's not withholding actual information. There wasn't any real info the husband could provide. He could have left it until she got home. Sounds like MIL just wanted OP to actually be there when wife got the bad news so he could console her. OP is TA because the only thing he actually accomplished was making his wife worry without knowing what she was worrying about", "I mean for a 2 hour drive mom and brother could've returned her calls if it was really important.", "Let's stipulate MIL is a generally well-meaning person.\n\nApparently she was so affected by the news she felt the need to say \\*something\\* but knew spilling the beans was wrong because it was BIL's news to tell. But this half-in-half-out thing put you, OP, in a very bad situation.\n\nI don't think you're at fault. People deal with this in different ways, but you're not wrong for thinking that for many people, if their partner knows there's something out there that could affect them, their partner has an obligation to tell them. For sure that's how I feel. If you'd known a piano was hanging over my head for 12 hours (or whatever) but didn't tell me because you didn't know what piano... I'd be furious.\n\nAnd \"you're going to learn some bad news\" is, for, well, probably the vast majority of people, far worse than the bad news itself. As a species, we hate uncertainty.\n\nSo even stipulated that MIL is generally a lovely person, in this instance she really dropped you, OP, into a pile of shit.", "No you see because he's \"just\" the brother in law (and because he's a man) he just needs to pull up his big boy pants and stay quiet! /s", "It's good news, but still upsetting if she didn't know about his suicidal thoughts.", "She sucks for texting and searching online while driving.", "I don't think we necessarily know that she was searching records while driving - she could have pulled over, looked it up when she was stopping for gas/food/etc. It just says \"before she got home.\"\n\nThe mention of the phone calls seems to imply that was when she was driving, but most cars have some sort of hands free calling built into the vehicle now. And even if she doesn't have that on her car, any smart phone can be controlled by voice (\"hey siri/Google, call Mom\" and then you can put it on speaker phone.)\n\nIt's just a pretty big leap to assume she was driving irresponsibly when that wasn't mentioned in the OP.", "> She didn\u2019t want to ruin my \u201ccredibility\u201d with her mom and family, so although she didn\u2019t tell them she knew there was something going on, she had reached out to both her mom and John to see if they wanted to talk while she was driving and her mom never responded to her text while her brother said he wasn\u2019t free. \n\nUnlike you, I don\u2019t rewrite the OP.\n\nIn your world she pulled over but got home in time, used voice to text to send the text, then text to voice to \u201cread\u201d them, was also not distracted while calling and being emotional on the phone.\n\nEven hands free is distracted driving for fucks sake. Go take a time out while the adults talk."]}
