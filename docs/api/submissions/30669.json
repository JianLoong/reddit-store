Over the years it always was a laughing point for us, maybe we\u2019d be out for dinner or doing the shopping and there would be kids screaming or causing havoc for their parents, we would always look at each other and say something like ah thankfully that\u2019ll never be us! I did not think I would ever entertain the idea of having kids or wanting to be a Father and the fact she was adamant on not having children was fine with me.\n\nThis all really began to change for me within the past 2 years I would say. My older Sister recently had a child, my niece. I don\u2019t want to sound cliche when saying something changed with me when I held my Niece for the first time but I have to be honest and say it did. Watching her grow over the past couple of years and watching how much closer it brought my Sister and her partner together made me realise I did want that, this wasn\u2019t something I just decided one single day, it\u2019s something that\u2019s been bothering me for an entire year and it\u2019s only recently I\u2019ve come to the real conclusion that I would like a family of my own, the only real issue is I can only picture me having that family with my partner.\n\nSo I came clean to my Partner and let her know how I was feeling. Let\u2019s just say that did not go well at all. She believes that I have wasted 8 years of her life because I now have suddenly decided that I want kids and because she doesn\u2019t I am going to leave her. Now I didn\u2019t say anything like this I only expressed how I was feeling about having children. We having been on great talking terms over the past 5 days since this conversation, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if this really is all my fault, I mean people change but an 8 year relationship with a joint opinion on never wanting children to suddenly deciding i do\u2026AITA?", "created_utc": 1699562655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rmjw9/aita_for_suddenly_deciding_that_i_want_kids/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck to both of you.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut she is right - if you REALLY want kids, and are NOT fine with never having kids - your relationship has no future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut since you did not know, and just changed your mind lately, there are no AHs.", "NAH.

If you desire kids, and she doesn't, that can lead to resentment which can hit toxic levels. 8 years into a serious relationship is very far along to switch gears. \n\nSo since she isn't entertaining the thought, which is absolutely her right, are you able to let it go? Or is this something you feel you need in your life? If you NEED to have kids, be honest, and move on. You cannot expect her to change her mind. She doesn't owe you that consideration at all. She was clear the entire time. You are the one who changed your mind.", "NTA but honestly? Her fear here is valid. The fact is? Kids/no kids is a pretty important decision in a relationship and a lot of relationships fail if one party is staunchly in the \u201cno kids\u201d camp whilst the other wants them - either hidden the fact they want kids and lied or (as it is in your case) a change of mind. It can cause a lot of resentment when someone wants kids and it isn\u2019t ever going to be an option in that relationship.\n\nNow, I know you\u2019ve said you didn\u2019t say you would leave her. However\u2026 As the years go on? Are you likely to resent the fact that she won\u2019t change her mind like you did? Is it upsetting you that it isn\u2019t ever going to happen?

You're sure that this is what you want, it's not just some random fancy that'll go away in a month or two.   \nIf it isn't what your partner wants, you need to consider whether to sacrifice ever having a family of your own and staying together (though you may end up resenting her in the long run), or agreeing that you're no longer compatible for each other and hopefully ending things on good terms.\n\nYou're NTA, but she's justified in feeling upset. At the end of the day, 8 years is a long time. People grow and people change, their preferences and priorities change.

She is justified in being a bit freaked out, especially since it's new to her while you've clearly had a long while to process through it.\n\nSeems like you guys are talking it out like adults and that's what you probably should keep doing. \n\nYWBTA if you started demanding kids out of her without consent, but it certainly doesn't sound like you've done that.", "NTA but she's justified with her feelings/opinions. Its a massive problem in a relationship.", "NAH, but if childrearing is important to you, you need to evaluate the relationship.    \nIts not fair to either person in a marriage to expect that each will stay exactly who they are on the day of the marriage.  Rather, its reasonable to expect changes over time.  You've experienced a change (she probably has too, just not on the baby front).  You've agonized over this.  We assume you've considered other options - helping with youth groups, being a Big Brother, etc. and determined you want the 18 year commitment.  After turning this over repeatedly, you shared this change with her.  She responded with shock and emotion, but at least she is being very, very clear with you.  \nIf you want to rear a child, she will not - ever - be the one to do so with you.  Any attempt by her to compromise will be a surrender and do nothing but foster resentment toward you and any child.", "NAH. People are allowed to change and it sounds like you're being open and honest with one another. That's really all you can do.", "Hey, that\u2019s a rough situation to be in. I would like to share a story I once heard on a podcast, it struck a cord and stuck with me for the past few years. \n\nThe lady in this story was a guest on the show and she told the hosts about her relationship with her partner. I\u2019ll try keep it short. She didn\u2019t want kids while he wanted to be a father. Also together for a long time and they didn\u2019t want to break up because they love each other and being together a lot. They decided to take a year to think about kids and their future, staying together but separately thinking about the topic. \n\nAt the end of the year their mindset didn\u2019t change, she still didn\u2019t want kids while he wants to become a father. But he also saw a future with her and didn\u2019t need to be a fulltime dad but being involved for him is very important. In the end he became a sperm donor/helped a lesbian couple to conceive a child. The couple wanted to start their own family without a random anonymous donor and preferred someone that\u2019s around and involved raising their kids. He still got to experience fatherhood and spends time with his kid(s) while staying together in the relationship where she isn\u2019t involved like that. \n\nI love the openness and acceptance from them, inspires me to look at things different. Maybe this story can bring you some insights, maybe not. However I wish you the best, NAH.", "NAH people are allwoed to change, but theyre also allowed to not change. I don't imagine this looks good for your relationship though", "I just wanted to add something because I feel like I could of titled this better than \u201cSuddenly\u201d changing my mind. Quite a few comments about me bringing this up to her without knowing really if I have changed my mind about having kids and keeping it to myself for 2 years. The reason I have kept this to myself is exactly for that reason, I didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s been something I have been contemplating/thinking about during this time and only now do I know, this is why I brought it to her. Did I bring it to her hoping she would change her mind? Probably a part of me did but no, I know where she stands and I fully respect that. I was just being open and honest about my thoughts. I do feel like I posted this in the wrong sub as I didn\u2019t know NTA meant the other party was the asshole, she is most definitely NTA.", "NTA - you are entitled to change your mind.  It is your life.  However - what is not guaranteed is that your partner has to agree or change their mind.   If this is truly a sticking point you may have to end the relationship and move on.", "You both grown and want different things now.  NAH", "NAH - it makes sense that she's upset that the dynamic has suddenly changed (for her it is sudden).\n\nWeather you like it or not from here you have two options, leave or grieve. The only alternative is to try and change her mind, which from years of being child free I'm sure you know is bad enough from rando aunties. This shouldn't be her decision because her options are all bad- deprive you of something,  destroy the future she planned,or unwanted pregnancy.  Oof!!\n\nWhen I say you will grieve if you stay, I mean that. I wanted a large family but medical issues meant we could only have one. \nWhile I was and am overjoyed with my small family,  It took me a full year to grieve the life I thought I would have. Guilt, shame, It wasn't the type of grief of experiencing a loss. But knowing a dream is lost can leave you with a lot of complicated emotions.\n \nThis isn't a switch you can turn off. She's right that things have shifted and it's natural for her to be scared. Her future was certain a few days ago and now it isn't.  If you stay will you resent her? If you go, what will her life look like.\n\nYou're not ta, but this is a huge crossroads. You need to make a decision to move forward.  \nGood luck.", "I hope the N T A votes realise that that vote implies the other party is the asshole (I didn't know this until recently). NAH, people change, that's normal. Her reaction is perfectly valid. Stance on kids/not having kids is a serious incompatibility issue. I wish you both luck in navigating through it.", "Ugh this has happened to me SOOOOOO many times! I had two kids with my ex husband, and after #2 I said no more. I have told every single person I have dated since within the first/second date that there was zero wiggle room on me having more children. And I've had to end 3 relationships because after a year or so, here it comes. \"I really want children with you\". Unfortunately, I don't see a happy outcome in this situation. I'm going to say NAH, but I'm pretty sure your partner feels blindsided and betrayed.", "NTA- but also ask yourself if you like the image you see vs the reality. Because it\u2019s nice to have nieces and nephews visit but they go home at the end of the day and kids change your entire life- thjngs are harder, more expensive and require much more planning. \n\nIf you\u2019re okay with that, then you have some big decisions to make. If not, honor what you\u2019re feeling and be an amazing uncle.", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for changing your mind, and your girlfriend isn\u2019t an asshole for being pissed off at what (to her) feels like an 8 year long bait & switch. Especially since statistically, the vast majority of childcare labor would be on her shoulders, not yours. Of course she feels betrayed. In her eyes, you want her to destroy her body for a kid you\u2019ll more than likely not help with much at all and that she never wanted in the first place. I\u2019d be pissed off too. But hey, you feel how you feel. You\u2019re not an asshole, but your partner does have every right to be mad about this, the same way you have every right to feel the way you do. \n\nHowever, I think you need to give this a LOT more thought. I love babies and small kids when they\u2019re well behaved and happy - their little potato bodies are adorable! The big-eyed baby faces! The coos and babbles! Adorable af. But the wet and shitty diapers, vomit, potty training, the tears and whining and ear-splitting screaming? Not so much. The minute I see tears or smell human waste, kiddo goes right back to Mommy - the gross stuff ain\u2019t my job to handle! Not to mention the long-term financial burden and the way all of your freedom goes down the drain in favor of living your life to support your child\u2019s happiness and well-being above all else. \n\nTbh to me, you sound like you have baby fever and a case of FOMO, not like you\u2019re really ready to be a parent. Holding a cute, calm baby a few times and thinking it\u2019s nice is **not** comparable to actually being a parent. It\u2019s a never-ending thankless slog of work and is generally an incredibly difficult and stressful undertaking that more often pushes couples apart than it brings them closer. \n\nYa know what? Speaking of that, why not give your sister and her husband a break and volunteer to look after your niece for 3-5 days unpaid with no help and see if you can even *handle* taking care of a kid 24/7. It\u2019s not just baby-giggles and cute tiny outfits, it\u2019s WORK. Unpaid, unending, thankless work. You no longer live for yourself and your happiness, but for the kiddo\u2019s. For plenty of people, they\u2019re happy to make that trade. For someone who used to joke about annoying screaming kids in public, I doubt you\u2019ll be in that camp.", "You know married childless couples are happier than couples with children", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to change your mind, just like she has every right to be upset that you did change your mind. Like you said, you didn\u2019t come by this decision easily, I hope you and your partner can figure out a way to reconcile. But if you do and  she doesn\u2019t, it might be time to move on. She might need time to think about it, or she might still be a total no and that\u2019s her prerogative. But no, you\u2019re NTA for deciding a family is what you really wanted. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve come to that decision now before you either waste more of each other time or you get to old.", "NTA. Sometimes it happens but you have to be prepared for what she wants for her future not just your wants, and that may end up in a break up if it's a non negotiable for both of you. Can you picture yourself with a child that is someone else's is probably the likely question you need to ask yourself. Also have you looked after the kids in your life for a few days before? Maybe doing that would give you a realistic idea of the potential life you say you now want?", "NTA, you\u2019re being honest. You do need to give them some time and we if your feelings remain this way. It could very well be a relationship ending issue.", "NTA. I was certain I didn't want children from the time I was 18 until I was in my late 30s. Then is suddenly changed. It happens. \n\nYour partner has a right to be upset because they were expecting something else. But if you really want kids and try to pretend that you don't THEN and only THEN will you be unfair and ruining your partner's life. \n\nYou may need to get some counseling to help you clarify the reason for your change of heart. Ask your partner to give you time to figure it all out. Make sure this isn't a phase. Set a time limit... like 6 months or something that feels right to fully explore this. Then if you still want to have kids, tell your partner you are moving on. It will be hard but it will be the right thing to do for both of you.", "NTA\n\nEven if you split up...\n\nWhy did you waste her time?\n\nShe had fun for 8 years with you.\n\nAnd since she doesn't want children, her biological watch isn't ticking.\n\nIf it was reverse, you promised her children and then for 8 years nothing and \\_then\\_ she has to look in a hurry for a new guy to get children before it is too late, it would be something different.", "YTA\n\nThe issue is, where does this leave you and her?

It's challenging to foresee unforeseen challenges like this, but it seems unrealistic to expect this relationship to endure when there's a fundamental disparity in your desires regarding children. Resolving this would necessitate one of you making a significant decision and embracing the consequences to sustain the relationship.

It's acceptable for people to outgrow each other; it doesn't have to be regarded as a loss but rather as the conclusion of a friendship that served its purpose.", "NTA for changing your mind.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to have children, even when you have to decide if you want to stay with the person who doesn't, or find someone new. Everyone is entitled to change their minds about anything and you have changed your mind. People in relationships also have changes that happen.

Over the years it always was a laughing point for us, maybe we\u2019d be out for dinner or doing the shopping and there would be kids screaming or causing havoc for their parents, we would always look at each other and say something like ah thankfully that\u2019ll never be us! I did not think I would ever entertain the idea of having kids or wanting to be a Father and the fact she was adamant on not having children was fine with me.\n\nThis all really began to change for me within the past 2 years I would say. My older Sister recently had a child, my niece. I don\u2019t want to sound cliche when saying something changed with me when I held my Niece for the first time but I have to be honest and say it did. Watching her grow over the past couple of years and watching how much closer it brought my Sister and her partner together made me realise I did want that, this wasn\u2019t something I just decided one single day, it\u2019s something that\u2019s been bothering me for an entire year and it\u2019s only recently I\u2019ve come to the real conclusion that I would like a family of my own, the only real issue is I can only picture me having that family with my partner.\n\nSo I came clean to my Partner and let her know how I was feeling. Let\u2019s just say that did not go well at all. She believes that I have wasted 8 years of her life because I now have suddenly decided that I want kids and because she doesn\u2019t I am going to leave her. Now I didn\u2019t say anything like this I only expressed how I was feeling about having children. We having been on great talking terms over the past 5 days since this conversation, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if this really is all my fault, I mean people change but an 8 year relationship with a joint opinion on never wanting children to suddenly deciding i do\u2026AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH imo\n\nYou are absoulutely allowed to want kids. I hopeyou have them someday. She is also allowed to feel the way she feels as well. People do change in many ways, I imagine your partner has just not on this. You have. I think you need to seriously prepare for this relationship to be over. If I made it clear from the get go that I never wanted kids and almost a decade later my partner is wanting them I would also feel pretty upset especially if I havn\u2019t signalled at all that my stance may have changed but that also does not make you an asshole because at the start of the relationship clearly you felt the same way about kids. Now you have to ask yourself a big question. Do you want kids? Or do you want your current relationship? Because she will clearly never want kids and in this relationship you will most likely never have them and you have to decide if thats a deal breaker for you guys or not.", "NAH. Sometimes you do change your mind about kids (I did). But her fear and anger is also valid.\n\nYou need to decide which is more important to you: kids or your partner. If your answer is the former, then please don\u2019t string your partner along.", "NAH. However you all need to rectify this ASAP! Resentment going to come into play if you don't.", "No one is TAH, but at this point, there's no reason for you two to be together if you're adamant about having a kid.", "NAH I understand both perspectives. This wasn\u2019t malicious or deceiving, you just had a change of heart and she can see the writing on the wall for your relationship. \n\nIn terms of the 8 years thing, how old were you when you started dating? I have also been with my partner for 8 years, however we started dating when I was 19. I am a different person then I was back then, my brain wasn\u2019t fully developed, and there\u2019s no way I would want to be held to my opinions as a teenager for the rest of my life.", "NAH. you're both completely valid. your feelings have changed and they're allowed to. that's fine. hers haven't, which is equally as fine.\n\nshe is scared of that change because she thinks that means she'll lose you. you're still hoping her mind will change like yours did.\n\nyou're going to need to communicate a lot and discuss this. it sounds like kids is still not something she wants at all, so most likely you're going to have to decide what's most important to you and what you want most. good luck, OP.", "You are not. But i also think its important to reevaluate your relationship. I am a child of a dad who didn\u2019t want kids but complied to make my mom happy this ended in multiple forms of abuse towards me then a messy terrible divorce. But this doesn\u2019t mean you should go without kids if you really want them. This is a hard decision but you don\u2019t wanna end up in a resentful relationship or with a child who\u2019s treated by one parent like they\u2019re unwanted.", "NAH. People evolve. I\u2019m sure your wife isn\u2019t happy about that you have changed your mind about having kids. However, you will have to decide together if you can continue the marriage with no kids or if you need to separate and live a different life.", "NTA \n\nBut do you want to have kids because apparently it brings partners closer?\nWhich is rarely the case by the way. Please don't have kids because of this reason.\n\nHaving kids can cause more problems than it is worth. Also, please don't take offence to this but a biological women are the ones having to do all the difficult work...carrying the baby, body changes permanently, mood changes, may not be able to do the things she could do before etc. It is a huge commitment to ask of her. Whereas biological men don't have to go through this.\n\nIt is OK to have changed your mind, but can you be with her without having kids? That is the question here. Also, is adoption or even fostering an option? \n\nAlso have you spent time with your neices 24/7 over the course of days, weeks and years?\nYou may have not seen the negative sides of having kids. Deprivation of sleep, not being able to do what you did before, etc. \n\nMaybe fostering could help ease your mind of wanting kids? If she was OK with thay and agreed to", "NAH it is absolutely understandable that she feels that way. And you are allowed to change your mind. But now you are incompatible on a fundamental level. That's going to be really rough on both of you. I wish you both the best.", "Nah \n\nI'm curious though, what do you expect having kids to be like? I mean are you prepared for the possibility that you won't get much sex, affection or attention from your wife during and for like 2 years after the pregnancy? \nDo you hate sleep? \nWould you be prepared to parent alone if she dies in childbirth? \nIf your kid is severely disabled will you be able to cope with that? \nIf your wife has ppd or ppa will you cope with being the only rational adult in the house? \nThere's a LOT of factors that go into having kids that people don't talk about, I just want to make sure you know what you're getting into", "NAH. For all the reasons already posted. I hope it all works out for you two.", "NAH. this happens sometimes. people change, and grow in different ways, and that means that sometimes people can outgrow their partners, or change in ways that no longer make them compatible. most of the time that\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, it just happens. it\u2019s the nature of things. life ebbs and flows. her fear is completely valid, and i\u2019m sure she\u2019s feeling incredibly blindsided. this is a difficult situation and i\u2019m sorry.", "NTA, and I would say something that some people might take as an unpopular opinion.\n\nEvery life lasting choice should be thought deeply. And deciding to never ever have children is a life lasting choice as much as is having children when you are Young, specially if you live your life based on that choice.\n\nPeople change, that's inevitable. There are tons of reasons on why people can change, and why people change their minds. You are not asking your partner to change her mind, you are just telling something that's happening to you. Not accepting you changed your mind because of something that happened in your life is an AH move and turning everything to make it about her and how you want to leave her is double AH move.\n\nI think you should consider doing some therapy as a couple or going to some kind of professional counseling, because this is the kind of thing that, if you stay togheter, will make both of you unhappy.", "This is the absolute perfect response. It will be a difficult road - but be certain once the decision is made that you stay on that path. It's the unknown that causes the most pain", "Yeah I can see that I definitely should have posted in a sub for relationship advice rather than here, apologies.", "Absolutely, 100% agree. OP has a decision to make, because he may feel that the only person he would want children with, is his partner. But that doesn\u2019t mean the partner will. I\u2019m afraid this is a Pandora\u2019s box now.", "My thoughts exactly. I would now be more fearful of the resentment on both side.", "This is a great point. Also, like so many things, you won't know what parenthood is like until you do it. OP, you are seeing it second-hand, you have no idea how relentless parenthood is. As for parenthood bringing a couple together, it destroys relationships far more often, it is so stressful. Studies show that people tend to be less happy after having kids, especially women, since more is typically asked of them.", "I agree with you. He did not waste her time. They had a good relationship. But now things have changed, and it is probably best they move forward separately to fulfill their life goals.", "I don't want to invalidate her feelings but yeah this seemed funny to me too. Like, \"I could have been not having kids with someone else for the past 8 years.\"\n\nShe's well within her rights to be upset about the situation of course tho just a funny line.", "I think OP was pretty thoughtful considering he spent a year thinking this over. Ultimatums are not a good answer with something like this.\n\nETA: People are allowed to change and they shouldn't be vilified for expressing that fact.", "> this wasn\u2019t something I just decided one single day, it\u2019s something that\u2019s been bothering me for an entire year and it\u2019s only recently I\u2019ve come to the real conclusion that I would like a family of my own,\n\nHe did everything you suggested", "If he did that, wouldn't that be a sort of ultimatum? If the answer is \"I think I want kids but I  know I want you more\" then fine, but if it is a dealbreaker then I think I would feel kinda blindsided and betrayed that I was left out of the process of my partner arriving to that realization.", "You are hugely projecting here. Not everyone has the same situation.", "So what you\u2019re saying is I should have started the conversation when I started to have these feelings? The only reason I didn\u2019t was because I wasn\u2019t sure what I was feeling, like I said in the post I didn\u2019t suddenly think that day right then yes i want kids you know.

People change.", "This comment is honestly horrid. You clearly haven\u2019t read the room or situation on this one at all. Calling someone an asshole because they have realised over time that they want to have a family with the person they\u2019ve spent 8 years of their life with. The nerve, this comment actually enrages me. This story clearly seems to have hit a nerve with you, but calling this person what you have when you barely know them is ridiculous, there are clearly no assholes in this situation. Apart from you McXaven.", "Thanks for your comment. Ive enjoyed every single moment of our 8 years together, not married by the way, she doesn\u2019t want marriage, I respected that. You seem to be jumping to a lot of conclusions about me based off of a rushed attempt at trying to explain the situation. I think your comment is horrible.", "Just from having a look at your previous input on this sub you seem to comment fake quite a lot. Not sure who or what upset you but believe it or not (I don\u2019t mind), I\u2019m not making up a story about changing my mind about having kids\u2026 why the fuck would I just make up something like this. Have a good night bro.", "NTA. You changed your mind. You also didn\u2019t waste her time. You guys had a moment in time and now that time is over. \n\nThis would be different if you both wanted kids and then you decided you didn\u2019t and she lost her opportunity to have them due to biological clock reasons. Bc then that would\u2019ve been a waste.  But being that she doesn\u2019t want them, she\u2019ll find someone else as will you.", "Here's some relationship advice - break up. I know it sounds harsh but kids isn't something you can compromise on. You either have them or you don't. \n\nEven if you broke her down and talked her into it there's every chance that she would resent you and wouldn't enjoy being a mother. And the child would be the one to suffer the most.\n\nAnd if you've been thinking about this for 2 years then you're unlikely to change your mind as well. So if she refuses and you stay then you may face that same resentment towards her. \n\nCut your losses and give both of you the chance to find partners who want the same thing.", "Ive seen so many happy couples, break up within a year or two of having a kid. I thought these couples were end goals too. But having a child changed them. While it hasnt hurt my relationship, we definitely have far less couple time and have to make a effort to maintain that relationship. Spontaneity goes out the window when you have to plan everything around your kids.", "No, he hasn't.\n\nI would LIKE a pet tarantula. I am not going to leave my wife even though she is the reason I do not have a pet tarantula.\n\nHe has to decide what he is doing.", "It \"hit\" a nerve because I am also childfree. This is literally a nightmare scenario for anyone who is childfree, wasting their lives with someone who was never childfree in the first place. If I was ops partner I'd be distraught and bitter but ultimately let them go because they have officially prioritized an idea over me.\n\nOp doesn't \"want a family with the person\", they changed the definition of what satisfied them as family. 2 people in a relationship can be family, you don't need children to be a family. Ops partner was satisfied with how things were and the goalpost in the relationship has changed drastically and unrealistically. \n\nOp can still be a good person, but in this situation he's an asshole. He DID waste 8 years of her life, other posts where someone has promised something in life to their partner and changed their mind op with no reason would def get a YTA rating.", "I read this over and over looking for reasons on \"wanting\" kids so I glossed over the relationship part, for that I apologize.

Are they the one who's got your back and willing to make sure that your child and your needs are met when you need them? Or are they the type that comes home from work, yells at you, complains about the baby crying, and goes to \"unwind from work\" until bedtime, leaving you continue to care for the baby, do housework, and cook food alone? assuming it's okay? When you try to bring up a problem do they outright reject it, minimize, DARVO, or are they willing to listen and work it out with you? Do you both compromise fairly or does one partner push the other to bend over backwards? \n\nCan they see past the end of their nose? When partner needs physical or emotional support, how do they react? Do they feel selfish towards the new baby like the baby is competition, or are they willing to understand that another person needs them even if it means getting up at night and caring for someone? \n\nAll the issues that people hide come right out to the forefront.

How can he make a decision to stay or leave if he doesn't know her answer?  \n\nWhat if she decides she's willing to have kids, or she's willing to adopt or to have a surrogate. These are all possible outcomes that she could say out side of just a no.  \n\nHe can not make a decision without at least talking to his partner and getting her opinion.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially when OP said \n\n>the only real issue is I can only picture me having that family with my partner.\n\nwhich means he isn't planning on leaving to have kids because his dream isn't to have kids.
