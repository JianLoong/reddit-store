One of my co-workers, let's call her Sarah, is fluent in Spanish. I have basic knowledge of the language, but I'm not nearly as proficient as Sarah. Recently, a situation arose where I had to make a decision regarding assigning patients, and now I'm wondering if I may have been in the wrong.\n\n\nWe had a particularly busy day at the clinic, and a number of Spanish-speaking patients needed assistance. Knowing that Sarah is fluent in Spanish and would be able to communicate more effectively with these patients, I decided to assign them to her. I thought this would improve the patient experience and ensure that they were receiving the best possible care.\n\nAfter I assigned the patients to Sarah, a few of my colleagues expressed their concern that I was unfairly burdening her with all the Spanish-speaking patients. They argued that it wasn't fair for me to assume she should handle them solely because of her language skills. They felt it was my responsibility as a team member to help out with these patients as well.\n\nIn my mind, I was simply trying to optimize patient care by assigning Spanish-speaking patients to the most capable communicator among us. Sarah's fluency in Spanish makes her better equipped to understand and address the needs of these patients, ensuring effective communication and better medical outcomes. I didn't see it as burdening her but rather utilizing her strengths for the benefit of the patients.\n\nDespite my intentions, I now realize that my actions might have been perceived as unfair and possibly discriminatory. I value my co-workers' opinions, and their concerns have made me question whether I acted appropriately. I never meant to imply that it was Sarah's sole responsibility to handle all Spanish-speaking patients, but rather that she would be best suited to handle them in that particular situation.\n\nDid I make the wrong decision by assigning Spanish-speaking patients to my co-worker based on her language skills? Should I have distributed the workload more evenly among the team? I'm open to your perspectives and willing to consider making amends if necessary\n\n*edit: patients do not speak english very well and feel more comfortable speaking with a spanish speaker employee", "created_utc": 1687545674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h67wb/aita_for_assigning_spanishspeaking_patients_to_my/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The other problem is that patients may have a relationship with the doctor but not always with the translator. Try and get a patient to be honest when speaking with a total stranger.

To put Sarah at that position without asking her is unprofessional and could potentially be seen as discriminatory because she's being assigned different patients than others.

In a previous job, someone came up to one of the copy writers on my team to translate some promotional materials they where putting on.   Luckily I walked passed when this thing happened (They figured, it was an easy and quick ask.).  It's NOT.  Spanish as a language uses more words and is richer in nuance.  Further, just because someone has a skill in writing one way, doesn't mean they have a skill for another.

Your decision was based on logic and reason, and prioritized the quality of medical care.

As long as her patient load is the same as everyone else's, just with disproportionately more spanish speakers, that should be fine.\n\n\nThis shit drives me batty. I'm a medical professional who believes that providing the best medical care is always the priority, which often includes a good amount of pragmatism. If communication between provider and patient is not effective (or possible), then the medical care will not be effective.

I often discount human emotions that are less than 5 out of 10, especially if they could easily be considered irrelevant in a medical situation.  My emotional responses are outside the norm and have been thoroughly and entirely discounted my entire life. My life experience has taught me that impractical and inconvenient emotions are to be ignored for the benefit of the majority.
