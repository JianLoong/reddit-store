One of my co-workers, let's call her Sarah, is fluent in Spanish. I have basic knowledge of the language, but I'm not nearly as proficient as Sarah. Recently, a situation arose where I had to make a decision regarding assigning patients, and now I'm wondering if I may have been in the wrong.\n\n\nWe had a particularly busy day at the clinic, and a number of Spanish-speaking patients needed assistance. Knowing that Sarah is fluent in Spanish and would be able to communicate more effectively with these patients, I decided to assign them to her. I thought this would improve the patient experience and ensure that they were receiving the best possible care.\n\nAfter I assigned the patients to Sarah, a few of my colleagues expressed their concern that I was unfairly burdening her with all the Spanish-speaking patients. They argued that it wasn't fair for me to assume she should handle them solely because of her language skills. They felt it was my responsibility as a team member to help out with these patients as well.\n\nIn my mind, I was simply trying to optimize patient care by assigning Spanish-speaking patients to the most capable communicator among us. Sarah's fluency in Spanish makes her better equipped to understand and address the needs of these patients, ensuring effective communication and better medical outcomes. I didn't see it as burdening her but rather utilizing her strengths for the benefit of the patients.\n\nDespite my intentions, I now realize that my actions might have been perceived as unfair and possibly discriminatory. I value my co-workers' opinions, and their concerns have made me question whether I acted appropriately. I never meant to imply that it was Sarah's sole responsibility to handle all Spanish-speaking patients, but rather that she would be best suited to handle them in that particular situation.\n\nDid I make the wrong decision by assigning Spanish-speaking patients to my co-worker based on her language skills? Should I have distributed the workload more evenly among the team? I'm open to your perspectives and willing to consider making amends if necessary\n\n*edit: patients do not speak english very well and feel more comfortable speaking with a spanish speaker employee", "created_utc": 1687545674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h67wb/aita_for_assigning_spanishspeaking_patients_to_my/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lets see if the patients feel better with english only staff who need to use google translate ti communicate.

They will get the best possible medical care with someone whom they can communicate.", "NAH\n\nI can see where you\u2019re coming from. I work in healthcare and generally if a doctor has a 20 min slot, it\u2019s almost always a 40 min slot if there\u2019s a translator. Everything has to be said twice. The other problem is that patients may have a relationship with the doctor but not always with the translator. Try and get a patient to be honest when speaking with a total stranger. IMOA is poor patient care. \n\nA 40 min slot means the doctor sees fewer patients. So less people get care. \n\nDirecting Spanish speaking patients to a Spanish speaking doctor is the best possible outcome for the PATIENT. Which matters. \n\nThe doctor is a human too and should have a say. So, not cool, but you realize that now. \n\nPeople saying you should learn to speak Spanish are HYSTERICAL. You have to be fluent conversationally and medically. Which is an enormous ask and would take years of hard work. It to mention that your are legally liable for any mistakes, and no employer would allow you to practice medicine in another language for YEARS. \n\nI once worked for a doctor whose office was located near a Nepali embassy. Almost all of her patients became Nepali. Should she go out and learn their language?! RIDICULOUS! \n\nThis is why so many doctors are quitting.

In my (English as first language) country, we\u2019re not allowed to talk to foreign patients directly even if we do speak their language fluently. Each patient gets assigned a qualified, government certified translator, to make sure that their diagnosis/treatment is not affected by the tiniest of misunderstandings.  And that is because fluent in language x does not equal fluent in language x when it comes to complicated medicine-related conversations.\n\nEdit: NTA, I guess. I\u2019m just confused\u2026", "NTA\n\nShe would have the same amount of patients if she wasn't fluent, they just wouldn't be Spanish speaking.

I live in Florida, i deal with varying language issues every day, and can only imagine how difficult it would probably be to try to diagnose and treat someone when you can't properly communicate with them. And i think that was your intent, caring about the patients.\n\nTalk to Sarah and see how she felt. If she is upset, apologize and say it wont happen again. If she was ok with it, maybe treat her to lunch or coffee to still show your appreciation. (And is she getting paid more for being the only translator available? I know of offices that do pay for that kind of extra work load) Talk to your office about hiring an aide that can bounce between physicians and be a translator while Sarah has a full workload so nobody has to be overloaded again.", "Has Sarah complained? If not, NTA", "If Spanish is not her first language then why did she learn it if not to be able to give people the best care. \n\nLook you know your patients and which ones are better with English than others.
