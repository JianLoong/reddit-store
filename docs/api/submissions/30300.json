I refused and even told my parents that if they started acting like parents and showing support, maybe I'd consider giving them tickets to another performance.\n\nMy comment seemed to visibly hurt my dad, and he started saying some backhanded comments about me not loving him. Now, he's cold towards me, and my mom is ignoring me. I'm starting to doubt my decision because, outside of this ballet drama, I really do like spending time with my dad.\n\nHere are three examples of the comments my dad has made:\n1. \"I can't believe you'd choose your aunt and uncle over your own parents.

You never supported your son doing ballet.\"", "exactly...they are trying to make OP feel guilty for their own awful parenting and wanting something just for the sake of it.", "He does this drama just happens over ballet outside of that he is a good dad", "What? How is that homophobic? Your claim is making quite a few assumptions. It's probably more like they don't find ballet to be 'manly' activity", "My siblings due show up sometime mostly my younger brother(14m) and yeah I\u2019ll talk to them", "I always offer them first and they don\u2019t show I just didn\u2019t want to get rejected again so I gave them to people who wanted them", "why does it matter ? whether the parents pay for the lessons or not they don\u2019t show up to the performances. so why should he have wasted tickets on them when they never show when he does offer them ?", "The same* parents that can't be bothered to show up for OP performing all the years before now magically expect those tickets to go to waste? Great comment. /s", "Does their lack of support come from a perception of ballet being girly or unmasculine?", "My mother used to pull the same shit, and I wish I had a been as strong as you, and invited people who actually cared. My mother demanded I gave her tickets to every band performance and never showed up so I never had anyone there because my dad worked night shift and he couldn\u2019t get it off because he was the only one bringing an income to the house. I\u2019m thinking they\u2019re just trying to say face and are insulted that they weren\u2019t your first choice. Let your dad talk crap and enjoy yourself", "Next time he breaks out the 'You're breaking my heart.' Tell him you've felt that way at every performance they couldn't bother to attend (add the number if you want to twist the knife), you're used to it, so he should get used to it. Rock that performance kid.", "So, not fully unsupportive, but not showing the same level of support as the other siblings.\n\nIs it possible it has nothing to do with you, but they just don't know/like ballet so find it harder to go and subconsciously avoid it? It's still not great, and they should at least make an effort for you as their child, but it's something you can explore if you decide to talk to them.\n\nStill take you aunt and uncle tho- your performance should be about the people who have been showing interest in what you are doing and actually want to see how far you've come.", "Don't feed that troll. Parents are supposed to be their kids' biggest supporters. You don't sound like a spiteful person, you sound like a kid who needs caring adult figures in your life.", "Good idea!!!", "My parents LOATHE live orchestra/symphony performances. Musicals? Sure. Opera? Not a lot, but it's fine. But orchestra/symphony puts them to sleep. They don't play music (appreciate it, listen to many genres, but don't play) but you bet they did their best to show up to every orchestra performance I had in school and paid for outside lessons, then came to the recitals. Because *that's what the really good parents do*. Even if they hate or \"don't get\" their kid's passion, they *show up*. My mom still jokes that my middle school orchestra concerts were actual torture, but she loves me, so it was worth it .\n\nIt doesn't matter if you hate your child's hobby. You *show up* because *you love THEM*. As adults, you learn to suck it up and do shit you don't like or find boring if it's super important to people you care about.", "My son is a musician and he plays and writes a lot of country music. I despise country music so much I actually have a physical reaction to it. But because he's my son and I love him, and want to support him,   I go and endure it, and never say anything negative about it because it's important to him.", "Yup and give them a non-apology, \"I'm so sorry I didn't realize you were interested in attending my performances. Here, I bought you both tickets with my own money and I can't wait to see you there.\"\nWhen they don't show he can use it against them in future fights or against family members who take their side.", "Well, yeah, that's my point with OP still taking aunt and uncle \n\nI'm just pointing out the possibility it's more them being self absorbed than having a problem with OP. That makes a difference if OP ever does want to talk to them. OP seems to think it's because they have a problem with him\n\nThat they're paying actually suggests they don't- if they really were against it, they wouldn't. The issue is they aren't  supporting all the children equally tho", "Okay this may be a smart way of resolving the issue of the show, not so great to hold it over them if they don't show up, but it's a peace offering", "Or they do, but don't want to be seen that way, so decided to pay for the lessons because \"We can't be homophobic because we pay for our son's ballet lessons.\" (Regardless of if OP is gay or not). There's no way for us internet strangers to know but it's not impossible for them to be trying to \"keep up appearances\" to a degree regarding all of it.", "Sorry I more meant that if they give him shit about future tickets he has this example to hold up."]}
