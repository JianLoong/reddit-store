Am I the jerk for not giving my parents tickets to my ballet performance and instead giving them to my aunt and uncle?\n\nSo, here's the backstory: My parents have never been supportive of my ballet passion. They rarely showed up for my performances, while they attended all of my siblings' school events and games. It's been really frustrating, and I've felt like they've always pushed my interests aside.\n\nRecently, when I had extra tickets for my ballet performance, I decided to give them to my aunt and uncle, who have always been there for me and supported my passion. When my dad found out, he got mad and demanded that I take back the tickets from my aunt and uncle and give them to my parents. I refused and even told my parents that if they started acting like parents and showing support, maybe I'd consider giving them tickets to another performance.\n\nMy comment seemed to visibly hurt my dad, and he started saying some backhanded comments about me not loving him. Now, he's cold towards me, and my mom is ignoring me. I'm starting to doubt my decision because, outside of this ballet drama, I really do like spending time with my dad.\n\nHere are three examples of the comments my dad has made:\n1. \"I can't believe you'd choose your aunt and uncle over your own parents. It's like you don't even care about us.\"\n2. \"You're breaking my heart with your selfishness. I thought we were close, but I guess I was wrong.\"\n3. \"You really must hate me if you can't do this one thing for your old man.\"\n\nSo, AITA for not giving my parents tickets to my ballet performance? Was I too harsh with my response, or should I stand my ground?

They\u2019re making it all about them. This isn\u2019t a slight to them - they\u2019ve never come before, you figured they weren\u2019t interested, you gave them to your aunt and uncle who\u2019ve expressed interest and supported you in the past. If they want to come, you could get more tickets. I think this may also be your dad not wanting to be shown up by his brother/BIL. They\u2019re trying to guilt you over something that they themselves did (not support you). They\u2019re showing you who they really are. Is there a teacher you can talk to about this? Do they do this kind of behavior over other things you do? I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this and I hope the performance goes well.", "NTA and your dad is a master gas-lighting guilt tripper!  Have you pointed out that he's never shown an interest in your passion, and is only acting out now because you (rightly) gave the tickets to someone who actually supports your endeavors?", "Why give tickets to people who are unlikely to attend?\n\nNTA", "Nta!  Ten your dad where to buy his tickets.  Put his money where his mouth is.\n\nFollow your passion and reward those who support you!", "NTA.  If they don't attend your performances, why do they care about the tickets?  They'd rather waste them?\n\nHowever, who is paying for these lessons?", "Like your parents, from past behavior would, have even gone :(\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nBut you could have handled it better. When he demanded the tickets back, I  would have over the top feigned surprise and said ' Sorry? Wait.... You're actually interested in my performance? Since you've never show up for any before, I figured you paid for my lessons only because I was interested, not that you were... Sorry but aunt and uncle have already accepted the tickets, and can't wait to see me preform *like they always love to*'\n\nLet's face it the only reason he's freaking out is that it makes him look bad. At this point if you got him tickets, he sounds like he wouldn't accept them or be a no show.\n\nStick with your aunt and uncle, you're gonna need them", "NTA. These were your tickets to do with as you wish, and your dad is out of line for asking you take back a gift you gave to your aunt and uncle. \n\nThat said, if you want keep the peace, you could tell your dad that now that you know it's important to him, you'll give future tickets to him and your mom.", "NTA, Is it sold out, or can your father just *buy himself a ticket??* He's being a total AH about this, and trying to guilt-trip you into feeling bad.

So yeah, harsher than necessary.  \n\nExpressing surprise that they were interested, apologizing (or non-poligizing) for not realizing they were interested and offering next time if they're still interested might have made the point with less hurtfulness. \n\nTheir reaction is also wildly over the top, so maybe this is your family's communication style both ways.", "Do the uncle and and aunt pay for lessons also ?", "Your parents are mad because the consequences of their own actions or inactions are knocking at the door.

I hope you have a great performance. You already know you give the tickets to the right people. NTA. Your mom and dad are.", "NTA.  Also consider the possibility that, if you give in to the guilt-tripping and give your tickets to your parents, they may not come anyway.  They will have regained control, but not given you anything in return.", "Your father is acting like a toddler. He never wanted to attend a performance, until the tickets went to someone else.

Your parents are homophobic.  They only have a problem with ballet because men are considered to be gay for dancing ballet.
