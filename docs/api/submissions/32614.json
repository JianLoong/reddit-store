It is a bit of travel for me to get there, costing at least \u20ac27, and I bought a gift worth \u20ac25 to wrap. However, two days before event my friend and host texted to say that buying supplies for everyone would be expensive so could I buy and bring my own or would I need some. I texted the other girls to see if she had asked them and they said no - so I was wondering why everyone else she was willing to pay for and not me. She then text to say my reply was too late and that she went to shop and bought supplies for the others and not me, but could get me some the next day if she had to. I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve always gotten supplies for my party guests and never asked for money - but I feel like a burden now. In the past she has also insinuated and publically berated me that she doesn\u2019t understand how I have money to shop (I have savings, sell clothes online and look after my nanny with dementia) but I wasn\u2019t going to say all that. Am I the asshole for thinking of not going?\n\nUPDATE: she sent messages about how much it would be and what would be owed and when I didn\u2019t reply for a while she said not to worry she has bought supplies for me now. What do I do?\n\nUPDATE 2: Thanks everyone for all your comments and support! I agree and so does my brother - I\u2019ve decided not to go and instead go Christmas shopping with my brother that day instead - but I did send money for the supplies when I told her I wasn\u2019t going (as per mothers suggestion) haha", "created_utc": 1702040973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dmhgk/aita_for_thinking_of_not_attending_a_party_i_have/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s so petty and a fucked thing to do to a friend. Tell her you can\u2019t and if you don\u2019t get to participate in the \u201carts and crafts\u201d turn it around on her and emphasize that you were singled out, nip that behavior in the bud!", "NTA \n\nBut why are you even planning to go? She is obviously not your friend and she treats you poorly.", "NTA.\nYou can change your plans, you don\u2019t owe her your attendance, especially when she basically said she didn\u2019t plan for you, and if you want to come you have to pay your own way.\n\nSay, \u201cI don\u2019t want to put you out. I\u2019ll stay home this time. Thanks for the invitation.\u201d", "NTA and I would seriously consider not being friends with her from the public berating of your finances alone.\n\nI would also ask her why she wanted you to pay but no other girl.

If you were told to pay to be there, but other's weren't, then you're clearly on the lower tier of friends.  Send your regrets without regret.", "NTA and it is more than reasonable not to go. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s that any possible joy of going has been killed.", "NTA, I just wouldn't go. I'd apologize and skip it, without making a big deal about it. \"sorry, I can't do that right now, but please don't put yourself out for me, we'll get together some other time.\" would be my response.", "NTA.  Time to reconsider if you want to continue this \"friendship\".", "NTA. Don't go. She does not sound like a friend. Return the gift and save your money.", "Info needed. When did you rsvp to the party?", "NTA, that's some bullshit. Sounds like your friend is trying to scam you out of money and make you feel bad about yourself. Don't waste your time or cash on this party.", "NTA. If your friend has a rational bone in her body she would understand", "NTA. I just read the title not the content yet... let me read first", "NTA, she didn't ask anyone but you? Weird . Don't go she clearly doesn't  deserve your time", "NTA\n\nShe does not want you there, but it would look bad on her to say it directly, so she tries to make it your decision. Spoiler: She would criticize you at your back for not going.", "NTA.  This person isn't your friend. Cut ties and move on. Don't go to the party.", "Don\u2019t go! F* that!", "What's the difference between costing and cost?", "This is a bad friend - have self respect, don\u2019t go and get better friends. Don\u2019t be an AH to yourself! NTA", "NTA, if you DON'T GO!  Why would you want to be treated like that?  Why would she exclude paying for the party favors of her own birthday party?  WHO has a birthday party and charges their guests for the supplies????", "Update: I wasn\u2019t reading her messages on Instagram so I had four waiting for me , the first three were about how much it would be and how much I would owe her then last message said \u201cdon\u2019t worry anymore I got you one x\u201d So idk if she realised over time that it was wrong in the first place?", "NTA at all. You don't have to go anywhere you don't want to go. But I'm worried about your feelings here and your social group. \n\nThis whole thing just smells like a misunderstanding to me. And I think that it would be best to talk kindly and simply about it instead of just hiding away in your home. I think you can talk about hurt feelings and you can say why you feel shy here without blaming. And see what the host says. Or see what a neutral friend says. You can say something along the lines of \"I'm not feeling very welcome because I was asked for money for supplies and I've never been asked to pay for a party. I'm worried this means that I'm not really welcome and I'm worried that I'm the only one who was asked to pay.\"   \n\n\nThat doesn't start drama, but it does make it clear how you feel. She will then have a choice between letting you know that you weren't the only one asked, or explaining her behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
