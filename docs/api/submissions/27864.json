I was already a stepmom to my husband's two kids who were 5 and 6 when I came into their lives. They are now 8 and 9. My husband and his ex-wife share custody equally of their two children so the kids are in our home every other week. But my husband is the primary parent in our home. He's their biological parent and we worked with a therapist to figure out the best way to integrate me into his and the kids family and it was agreed I would take a secondary role and not a primary role when parenting. So even though I am a stepmom I don't have all the same experiences as my husband as their bio parent. But I also wasn't around them from birth.\n\nHaving my first baby has been challenging at times. It was made worse by my ILs. They will show up to help me but they also invalidate the fact this is my first time having these experiences. They will bring up my stepkids as being my experience or say I'm an expert at doing all these things because I have two kids already. But I have none of these newborn experiences. My husband wasn't aware of everything they were saying. He heard them once and commented that it was different because I wasn't around my stepkids when they were this little. But for the most part I thought I could work things out with my ILs instead.\n\nBaby is having a rough time. Our pedi is doing tests because baby is not sleeping and is crying a little more than pedi would like, and the kind of cry is making pedi want to check that everything is okay. So we're both sleep deprived and I'm not eating great...\n\nBaby was crying a lot and I voiced out loud that I was so lost and being a new mom was brutal. My MIL told me I shouldn't be feeling that way on my third kid and I should take all the experience I have as a mom of three and figure out a way to settle myself so I can settle baby. FIL said I was overthinking and calling myself a new mom was incorrect because I have been a mom for years. I lost my temper. I was just so tired and I told them I was a new mom, I had never raised a baby before and wasn't my stepkids mom. I told them I came into their lives when they were already in school and I didn't take on a full parental role with them but a secondary one, which they know, and every time they insist I have done all this before I just feel more and more stressed and agitated. I told them it was not helping me and then I asked them to leave for the day because I could not hear any more of their crap.\n\nThey called my husband that night and asked what the fuck I lost my temper like that for. They said they were here to help and I was dismissing what I was to my family by saying I was not a mom to my stepkids. They said I might have PPD or something but I should not be angry and rude to them and I owe them an apology. He told them they owed me an apology and they responded that they had done nothing wrong and I was ungrateful.\n\nAITA?

I explained that I was not nervous, I was exhausted. I asked the doctor if it might help if I switched to another formula (I had to stop breast feeding at one month, which is when the screaming began). The doctor said switching formulas was unlikely to help but it wouldn't hurt, so may as well give it a try.

NTA.", "NTA I feel like your in laws are possibly anticipating (wrongly) that now that you have a biological child that your focus will move only to the baby and they are downplaying how significant these \u201cfirsts\u201d are to try to influence how you are thinking. It could also be that these things aren\u2019t as exciting to them because they\u2019ve seen it before and they have the empathy and imagination of a rock so can\u2019t fathom that it\u2019s different for you.", "NTA, a thousand times NTA. They were not helping whatsoever. Not sure why it's so hard for them to understand and see that you never took care of a newborn. Raising kids of their own, they should be able to know and understand that raising a newborn is a different experience than raising little kids. I'm not a mother and even I understand this. I'm glad your husband took your side. Don't let them in next time.", "Wow, NTA. Give yourself some time. Take a breather when you need to. If baby is crying, but fed, and dry etc, you can allow them to cry and step away for a bit. It's hard and does get better. Good for telling in-laws where to go!!", "Nta, I didn't help raise step-children, I will say that with my third son I felt clueless as though I hadn't had kids, my youngest cried and cried and nothing I did helped calm him down. His Dad would take him and boom son would stop crying. That made me feel as though I just didn't know how to take care of a newborn. \n\nKeep your in-laws at arms length, don't apologize to them, if they overstep again with their thoughtless words, blast them back again. When your baby sleeps, take a nap yourself, get your rest and don't worry about being super Mom cleaning and cooking while baby sleeps.\n\nYou will get through this, my youngest is grown up with kids of his own. And yes the newborn stages were rough on him and his spouse.", "NTA.\n\nGuess what? They are only allowed over when your husband is home. Done. He can deal with them and you can go lay down and rest. Bring baby with you if that will help or let Dad handle baby unless it's feeding (if nursing).\n\nI'm sorry your little one is uncomfortable. It sounds like a good Pedi tho if they are concerned with the type of cry. That's a good ear.", "NTA. Doesn't matter even if you had more \"experience\" with the step kids if you are having a hard time you are having a hard time those feeling are valid! Whatever your past experience with kids may or may not be whatever you are experience right now should be validated and supported.", "NTA.\n\nYour ILs are causing more stress than being helpful. It's probably best that they take a step away for awhile. Do you have family or friends that might be able to help if you need it? Perhaps a paid helper for a few hours a day?", "NTA\u2026 but that\u2019s the point they are not being helpful to me. They are invalidating my experience as an a parent to a newborn and yeah, you guys have already gone through this but I haven\u2019t\u2026. and I wish they would stop telling me that I have.\n\nWhat I would like to hear from people who are helping me is that when I say I\u2019m really tired or I\u2019m having a hard time sleeping they should say oh I\u2019ll take the baby and you go take a nap not you should be used   This as a step mom", "NTA, I suggest you keep them away for a while until they get the point. I\u2019m glad your husband has your back.", "NTA even if you had a baby before, every baby is different and its OK to struggle.  I felt like a new mom everytime because my kids were so different.  I gained experience with each and every one of them.  But it was rough.", "NTA.  You need to tell your husband to get his parents evaluated by their doctor.   There is some serious cognitive dissonance here.  They seem to be confusing you and the ex-wife. It is not uncommon for both spouses to experience dementia at the same time. \n\nAlso if it isn\u2019t dementia suggesting that it is might shock them out of the AH behavior.", "NTA.\n\nThis is new experience for you. You didn't birth your stepkids. You didn't have to do feedings or diaper changes.", "NTA. ILs need to learn to STFU tho.", "You are NTA and your husband is amazing. It should be the norm, but we know it isn\u2019t, for your spouse to back you up when you are getting hassled. He knows you need the support and boom, there he is!\n\nEvery thing you said about being a new mom is valid. If your ILs don\u2019t like it too bad!\n\nCongratulations on your new baby!! I hope all of the testing etc comes back ok and things get easier soon!", "NTA. They can just not come over. Simple.", "NTA and good on your husband or having your back.", "NTA.  I just gave birth.  Even I understand this baby will be different from my first and will require a lot of adjustments between me, my husband, and our first son.", "NTA. Even if this actually was your third baby, every baby is different. You could have raised 100 babies before and that would not invalidate your struggles with *this* baby. Your in-laws were not encouraging you, although I'm sure they think that they were, they were invalidating and dismissing your feelings.", "NTA - they were \u201cthere to help\u201d but clearly weren\u2019t helping.", "NTA, your a sleep deprived worried mother having to deal with 2 fuck wits who won't shut up.", "NTA", "op=nta\n\nI think husband needs to put your In-laws in a time out.  He sounds like he's being a good supportive husband(I hope he's being a hands on dad too).\n\nListen, look for a real support network-even if it's online.  Get some venting in to people who can just listen without judging.  and yes get some help if you have PPD.\n\nAs to your new baby--I hope it turns out to be a minor problem and that you are able to alleviate the problem soon.  Good luck and know you are doing the best you can.  And that's just fine.  You will get through this!\n\n  \nETA  Info--do they try to pretend your husband's EX doesn't exist?  Like now you are the mother because they are in pretend land?", "NTA\n\nI really just to tell them on your behalf to go away for 6 years so you have time for your experiences to match up with their expectations.", "Your inlaws sound, frankly, ignorant.\n\nNTA.", "You're fine. Your IL parents seem to want to pretend that ex-wife never existed and that you magically replace her somehow. That's more than a little strange. It's as if they both have dementia or something.\n\nSo, yeah, it's them - not you. They need to be the ones apologizing, not you. Then they need to just stop with the minimizing and just help as much as they can.\n\nIf they refuse, it sounds like you would be much better off without them around at all. Maybe just hang out once your baby is doing better and you are feeling more back to normal.", "NTA. They are completely and utterly wrong and assholes to boot. Tell your husband that they are no longer allowed over unless he is home to deal with them. And never,  never apologize for what you said. Them trying to make you apologize is a power play. They want to prove that they get to control the family and that you are beneath them. Don't let that happen.  Prove to them that you and your husband are a team and that your house is not their playground.", "Huge NTA. It's wonderful to love stepchildren as if they were your own, but that's not a valid reason to be blind to facts, which are:\n\n* You don't have any experience at all with NEWBORNS. Those kids were already in school by the time you entered the family. This is your very first time giving birth to a baby, ergo, first time mother.\n* You are the SECONDARY parent to them, because they already have two primary parents, both of whom were there before you were, very consistently I would assume.\n* You did exactly everything your therapist recommended in regards to parenting.\n\nYour ILs suck. BIG points to hubby for being on your side!!!!!!", "NTA. And you're absolutely right in that the newborn experience is way WAY different and harder than kids 5+. Your ILs must shut the f up and either help or leave. \n\nAlso to add my first was a bad sleeper, waking up every 1-2 hours for the first 15 months if her life. It was hell. I was exhausted, physically and mentally. In retrospect it gave me PPD. Sleep is so important for mental health. Please try priorize rest above all other chores you have to do right now while you figure out that the issue is with the little one. Good luck!", ">He told them they owed me an apology\n\nGood man, right there.   \nYour inlaws are being fairly obtuse, and they got what was asked for.", "Mom of 3 here- 2 of them cried a LOT, one for acid reflux, the other for something called silent reflux. NO, you don't magically learn to settle things just because you've done it before. \n\nAlso, that sort of talk is NOT helpful and if they were there to help, then their help sucked.\nNTA", "NTA. HTF are they gonna tell YOU what experiences you have and have not had?!? What kind of asshat tells an exhausted new mom that she is wrong to feel the way she does and to just calm herself? They need to give you some space for a while, until the pedi and you are confident that  baby is okay and thriving, and that mom is less stressed out. They need to not come over for at least a month or two. And they need to get their effing heads on straight and realize that you are not their grandkids mother. You didn't birth them and they are being absolutely bizarre trying to insist otherwise. \n\nI'm sorry, Momma. Feel better soon. \u2764", "I always found locked doors to be super comforting NTA", "NTA\n\nGreat to hear that your husband is on your side through this nonsense. Even if they think your stepkids might feel left out by you acknowledging that this is your first child, they're going about it in all the wrong ways.\n\nUntil they sincerely apologise, they don't come anywhere near you or your baby. Let your husband handle them, and focus on your child. Being a new mom *is* brutal, and you're doing a great job. I promise, it will get better. Just hold on!", "NTA. Your  husband needs to support you. They should not be there when he is not, and he should shut them down immediately when they start with their nonsense.", "NTA your il's are idiots and I'm so happy your husband backed you up! No need to stress. Breathe and do whatever u can to keep your sanity. That's all u can do sometimes.", "NTA at all. Glad you have the support of your husband because it's hugely important when navigating parenthood for the first time. Prioritize protecting your own peace, which it seems your husband will help you do, and your first time motherhood experience will benefit from that greatly. Your baby is so lucky to have you as Mom.", "NTA, but you are going way to far in describing things to them.  \u201cI have NEVER had a baby before so both my body and this baby are new experiences.  Quit downplaying it.  A good, experienced parent might help by offering to try to calm baby or maybe see what I\u2019ve tried and see if there is something they tried that I have not.  You two do none of that.\u201d", "NTA.  Your parents-in-law are belittling your feelings.  By insisting you've done all this before, they're warping the truth -- the newborn stuff is brand new.

They can't take that away from you.", "Nta  raising 5 year olds is a whole different game than a BABY. Being a new mom to a baby is really really hard.", "Yikes! Proud of you OP for standing up for yourself and asking them to leave. They are no help. NTA", "NTA, and brava to hubby for telling them to apologize to you.

You\u2019re a brand new mom of 1. NTA", "Exactly. Even if OP had been taking an active parenting role with the stepkids and was considered a second mom, this is still her first *baby*, and that\u2019s a very different thing.

This is the comment I came here looking for. Or I would have made it myself if I didn't find it. I gave birth to three kids. Each one was a different experience. OP, you are doing great. Continue to consult with the doctor to figure out why the baby cries the way they do. As far as your husband is concerned, he sounds like a keeper! Your ILs need to back off. I wonder if they did the same to the SKs mom.", "Agree.

Birthmom could ask if ILs remembered if all three shared a room and did they take turns taking care of babies. Get stupid with it...really stupid.

Those sort of stupid questions.", "No, she definitely isn't. Her in laws are awful", "Yeah, OP, get a ring doorbell and ignore them when they arrive if your husband isn't home. If they have a spare key, change the locks. If your husband is home when they come by, lock yourself and baby in your bedroom. If they can't be nice to you, they don't need to be around you.
