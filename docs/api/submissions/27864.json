{"id": 27864, "submission_id": "16v5uwh", "title": "AITA for losing my temper with my ILs and asking them to leave?", "selftext": "I (28F) had my first baby six weeks ago. I was already a stepmom to my husband's two kids who were 5 and 6 when I came into their lives. They are now 8 and 9. My husband and his ex-wife share custody equally of their two children so the kids are in our home every other week. But my husband is the primary parent in our home. He's their biological parent and we worked with a therapist to figure out the best way to integrate me into his and the kids family and it was agreed I would take a secondary role and not a primary role when parenting. So even though I am a stepmom I don't have all the same experiences as my husband as their bio parent. But I also wasn't around them from birth.\n\nHaving my first baby has been challenging at times. It was made worse by my ILs. They will show up to help me but they also invalidate the fact this is my first time having these experiences. They will bring up my stepkids as being my experience or say I'm an expert at doing all these things because I have two kids already. But I have none of these newborn experiences. My husband wasn't aware of everything they were saying. He heard them once and commented that it was different because I wasn't around my stepkids when they were this little. But for the most part I thought I could work things out with my ILs instead.\n\nBaby is having a rough time. Our pedi is doing tests because baby is not sleeping and is crying a little more than pedi would like, and the kind of cry is making pedi want to check that everything is okay. So we're both sleep deprived and I'm not eating great...\n\nBaby was crying a lot and I voiced out loud that I was so lost and being a new mom was brutal. My MIL told me I shouldn't be feeling that way on my third kid and I should take all the experience I have as a mom of three and figure out a way to settle myself so I can settle baby. FIL said I was overthinking and calling myself a new mom was incorrect because I have been a mom for years. I lost my temper. I was just so tired and I told them I was a new mom, I had never raised a baby before and wasn't my stepkids mom. I told them I came into their lives when they were already in school and I didn't take on a full parental role with them but a secondary one, which they know, and every time they insist I have done all this before I just feel more and more stressed and agitated. I told them it was not helping me and then I asked them to leave for the day because I could not hear any more of their crap.\n\nThey called my husband that night and asked what the fuck I lost my temper like that for. They said they were here to help and I was dismissing what I was to my family by saying I was not a mom to my stepkids. They said I might have PPD or something but I should not be angry and rude to them and I owe them an apology. He told them they owed me an apology and they responded that they had done nothing wrong and I was ungrateful.\n\nAITA?

It's sad that your in-laws won't respect you taking a secondary role and are ignoring the fact this is *your* first baby. \n\nYour husband needs to deal with his parents. This shouldn't be on you to work it out, especially since it concerns his children.

They are like sqawky, angry potatoes. But they get to be sooooo fun! \n\nOne tip - look into Craniosacral therapy massage for your baby. They carry a lot of tension in their own bodies from birth and I did this with my baby and it was a GAMECHANGER. He hated the car seat, lying flat or not being held for his first couple of months and this released all the fascia tightness and it was a whole new baby. \n\nHang in there.

WTF are they visiting with the two of them together anyway; that doesn't sound like help at all but like an exhausting social visit. From now on, their visits should be scheduled for when your husband is home. You have a newborn baby, you should \\*not\\* be entertaining guests. Your husband should be entertaining guests. That means: offering foods and drinks, cleaning up after them, cleaning the house up to whatever standard the guests expect before they arrive, making small-talk, being in the same room as the guests as much as possible,  directing the guests on how best to help, and defending you from any criticism and sneers (including subtle sneers about the state of the household where there might be a tacit \"assumption\" in the eyes of some sexist people that the problem would be your responsibility).\n\nIf you really, really feel like you must receive your in-laws when your husband is at work, you'll need to invite a friend or family member over who can take on this \"husband\" role.", "NTA I\u2019d have a serious talk with your husband about the blatant disrespect from his parents.", "NTA.

Either way, they're wrong, I'm glad DH is on your side but maybe yall should've nipped this in the bud earlier.

Looking after a newborn is certainly different from looking after school age kids.\n\nI can relate to you exhaustion due to a screaming baby. My first child cried night and day, non stop. At only a month she was flipping over in pain. The doctor said a baby that young can't roll over and she was crying because of my \"new mother nervousness\". I explained that I was not nervous, I was exhausted. I asked the doctor if it might help if I switched to another formula (I had to stop breast feeding at one month, which is when the screaming began). The doctor said switching formulas was unlikely to help but it wouldn't hurt, so may as well give it a try. I started giving her a soya based formula, and from the very first feeding my 5 month old baby became an absolute joy. It turns out she was lactose intolerant!", "NTA...and hold on to that husband!

They want to cause issues or have severe memory problems not sure which. When they next bring up you dealing with children previously 1- says \u201c in laws when step children were born I was doing x-y-z, I was no where near stepchildren when they were infants. 2- in laws do you have memory issues? Do you remember ever seeing me when stepchildren were infants? That\u2019s because I had not met them yet.\u201d  Dealing with a 4 year old is different than a newb. Then husband needs to tell in-laws to stop bringing up your previous experience, or they will be asked to leave every time. \n  I hope doctor can help your little one so your life calms down.
