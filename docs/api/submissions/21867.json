The market has set hours, and vendors are expected to set up on time and take down when the market is over.\n\nYesterday, after I packed up my van and was about to drive out of the market 20 minutes after closing time, a customer called out to me, and I heard them because I had the windows down. They wanted to buy something and thought the market closed an hour later. I told them the market has always closed at the same time, that my product and cash box were already packed away, and that I had a pressing matter to attend to that wouldn't allow me to stop, unpack, and assist them. I repeated that explanation when they offered to follow me to my store and make a purchase while I was unloading.\n\nI thought that was the end of the conversation but continued to worry I had disappointed someone and that this could end up on our local ranting Facebook pages. About an hour later, the customer messaged my business. I'll paraphrase as fairly as I can here. They said they were disappointed and suggested I adopt a more \"can do\" attitude. They said I could have given them the product and let them pay me later. (I didn't recognize this customer; I serve thousands of people.) They said I didn't use my critical thinking skills and that I should have tried harder. They also shared how much money they spent at the market with other vendors.\n\nAfter I had finished with my pressing personal business, I responded. I thanked them for messaging me and expressed by regret in disappointing them. I said that money would not have convinced me to stop because I really had something that required me to pack up and leave as quickly as possible. I thanked them for shopping with us for the last several years and expressed my hope that even if they chose to stop doing business with us, they had found our products worth buying up to that point.\n\nThe customer sent another response I read this morning, which is what prompted me to post here. They said they only shared the dollar amount to show they were genuine. They said they were upset by my lack of interest in being helpful in a genuine way. They didn't like my tone when I explained that the market has always closed at the appointed time and pointed out they were recovering from surgery. They found my response to be disingenuous and said my comment about whether or not they would continue to shop with us was \"telling\" because they never implied that.\n\nI decided not to respond, but I'm also really bothered by this whole exchange and want to make sure I do right by my customers, especially those who have supported me for a long time. (Even though I didn't recognize them, I could see they've shopped with us periodically for several years.)

FWIW recently I\u2019ve had a few complaints about how hard it is to book with me because I am so busy. I have actually considered making more accommodations for this supposed problem. However, my bookings have been consistently down for the past 2 months and this week I hardly have any appointments, leaving me to wonder if the complaints are just from people who are mad that they can\u2019t have everything their own way. \n\nMy point is that the small vendor/client relationship is really two-sided. The vendor has to provide good, consistent service, but the customer has to support the business in a way that allows it to thrive. Clients who don\u2019t support their vendors aren\u2019t really good customers IMO. \n\nI dunno if this makes sense, but NTA", "Fucking boo hooo.

They don't actually care about the principles here; they just want to complain and feel right and hate when told no. I would have posted a single very professional response that left no room for concessions and been done with it. No one cares that some weird entitled person wasn't able to buy stuff in off hours.

You did nothing wrong, and no one should ever expect a business to go above & beyond for them *after closing hours!* You have a LIFE too, and no one is entitled to expect you to give up your personal time that way. Unfortunately that person's mind is set firmly that they are right about this, and more back and forth discussion won't change it.  You gave a thoughtful response, just leave that as your last word.", "NTA. The poor lambs didn't have their expectations met and are having a hissy fit.  Don't waste an iota of your precious energy on them.", "NTA. Their comments about your attitude and how you didn\u2019t \u201cuse your critical thinking skills\u201d are super rude. They\u2019re basically suggesting that you\u2019ve failed in your responsibility to solve their problem for them. Maybe if you could have done them a favor and stayed a few minutes to help them you would have, but it wasn\u2019t even an option that night, so they needed to move on to Plan B instead of expecting you to drop everything and help them at your own expense. Their second message is just obnoxious and I\u2019m not sure what they expected to accomplish with it.", "It seems to me that you are a sensitive and caring business owner who cares about the nuances of your customers\u2019 feelings, but in this case I would just categorize this person very reductively as someone trying to exploit you. Every reasonable person understands \u201cWe\u2019re closed.\u201d Unless it\u2019s some sort of crazy emergency like a mother needing medicine for her sick child, it is just nuts to keep on like he is. NTA.", "I get being bothered by this. I would be too. I vote NTA. People can cover being an entitled customer by wording it sweetly and professionally, all the while they're in the wrong and deflecting from that. Your hours are your hours. The displeasure they experienced was from not getting their way so they tried using guilt to make you feel remorseful about not caving and giving them what they wanted. Whether you had something to do after is irrelevant. They can come back the next day during working hours. Its just groceries. And they could have checked your hours prior to showing up. I don't buy that they thought you closed an hour later. Even if they did, that wasn't true. So they'll know for next time. \n\nDon't feel guilty for this.", "NTA I work retail and if people show up after closing then they\u2019re S.O.L. If there are people still in the store after closing time we will close the doors and make pages over the intercom every five minutes. The latest I\u2019ve had someone stay was 20 minutes after closing and I was so livid with her rudeness. If a store closes at a certain time every day then as a customer you should make it so you arrive at least a 15 minutes before closing. The customer mentioning their surgery is just some guilt trippy nonsense. I hate when they try to make excuses using their personal issues that frankly aren\u2019t my problem or business. You are never obligated to reopen and put cash drawers back in to accommodate anyone who can\u2019t manage their time.", "Hahahaha ok the title alone", "I hate that business owners like yourself are sometimes pressured into violating their own boundaries for fear of unjust retaliation from online reviews", "Why do you assume the customer was a woman?", "catch me at the starbucks at two in the morning complaining about the service. nta", "Usually there are a bunch of comments posting the rest of the quote here, \"in matters of taste\".  I can't believe I'm first LOL", "I was envisioning a white guy in his 50s driving a pickup with a bed that had never been used.", "Yeah, I wondered this too and even went back up to see if I had missed something. I imagined a cranky mid to late 50s man tbh.", "Someone has to be :) anyway the first part of the quote has taken on a life of its own, I guess.", "This reminded me of another saying people often get wrong, which is \"If you build a better mousetrap, people will beat a path to your door\". Said like that, it seems to imply that if you have the 'best' product, you will inevitably get the most sales.\n\nThe full phrase ends with \"even if your house is in the middle of the woods\". What it is *supposed* to mean, is that people will go through more of an effort to get a better product, but not that you will just randomly start getting sales if you have a good product. It's subtle, but I've heard people wildly misinterpret it in startup crowds."]}
