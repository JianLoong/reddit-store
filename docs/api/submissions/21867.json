The market has set hours, and vendors are expected to set up on time and take down when the market is over.\n\nYesterday, after I packed up my van and was about to drive out of the market 20 minutes after closing time, a customer called out to me, and I heard them because I had the windows down. They wanted to buy something and thought the market closed an hour later. I told them the market has always closed at the same time, that my product and cash box were already packed away, and that I had a pressing matter to attend to that wouldn't allow me to stop, unpack, and assist them. I repeated that explanation when they offered to follow me to my store and make a purchase while I was unloading.\n\nI thought that was the end of the conversation but continued to worry I had disappointed someone and that this could end up on our local ranting Facebook pages. About an hour later, the customer messaged my business. I'll paraphrase as fairly as I can here. They said they were disappointed and suggested I adopt a more \"can do\" attitude. They said I could have given them the product and let them pay me later. (I didn't recognize this customer; I serve thousands of people.) They said I didn't use my critical thinking skills and that I should have tried harder. They also shared how much money they spent at the market with other vendors.\n\nAfter I had finished with my pressing personal business, I responded. I thanked them for messaging me and expressed by regret in disappointing them. I said that money would not have convinced me to stop because I really had something that required me to pack up and leave as quickly as possible. I thanked them for shopping with us for the last several years and expressed my hope that even if they chose to stop doing business with us, they had found our products worth buying up to that point.\n\nThe customer sent another response I read this morning, which is what prompted me to post here. They said they only shared the dollar amount to show they were genuine. They said they were upset by my lack of interest in being helpful in a genuine way. They didn't like my tone when I explained that the market has always closed at the appointed time and pointed out they were recovering from surgery. They found my response to be disingenuous and said my comment about whether or not they would continue to shop with us was \"telling\" because they never implied that.\n\nI decided not to respond, but I'm also really bothered by this whole exchange and want to make sure I do right by my customers, especially those who have supported me for a long time.

You did nothing wrong, and no one should ever expect a business to go above & beyond for them *after closing hours!* You have a LIFE too, and no one is entitled to expect you to give up your personal time that way.

You gave a thoughtful response, just leave that as your last word.", "NTA. The poor lambs didn't have their expectations met and are having a hissy fit.  Don't waste an iota of your precious energy on them.", "NTA. Their comments about your attitude and how you didn\u2019t \u201cuse your critical thinking skills\u201d are super rude. They\u2019re basically suggesting that you\u2019ve failed in your responsibility to solve their problem for them. Maybe if you could have done them a favor and stayed a few minutes to help them you would have, but it wasn\u2019t even an option that night, so they needed to move on to Plan B instead of expecting you to drop everything and help them at your own expense.

NTA.", "I get being bothered by this. I would be too. I vote NTA. People can cover being an entitled customer by wording it sweetly and professionally, all the while they're in the wrong and deflecting from that. Your hours are your hours. The displeasure they experienced was from not getting their way so they tried using guilt to make you feel remorseful about not caving and giving them what they wanted. Whether you had something to do after is irrelevant. They can come back the next day during working hours. Its just groceries. And they could have checked your hours prior to showing up. I don't buy that they thought you closed an hour later. Even if they did, that wasn't true. So they'll know for next time. \n\nDon't feel guilty for this.", "NTA I work retail and if people show up after closing then they\u2019re S.O.L. If there are people still in the store after closing time we will close the doors and make pages over the intercom every five minutes. The latest I\u2019ve had someone stay was 20 minutes after closing and I was so livid with her rudeness. If a store closes at a certain time every day then as a customer you should make it so you arrive at least a 15 minutes before closing. The customer mentioning their surgery is just some guilt trippy nonsense. I hate when they try to make excuses using their personal issues that frankly aren\u2019t my problem or business. You are never obligated to reopen and put cash drawers back in to accommodate anyone who can\u2019t manage their time.", "Hahahaha ok the title alone", "I hate that business owners like yourself are sometimes pressured into violating their own boundaries for fear of unjust retaliation from online reviews", "Why do you assume the customer was a woman?", "catch me at the starbucks at two in the morning complaining about the service. nta", "Usually there are a bunch of comments posting the rest of the quote here, \"in matters of taste\".

Said like that, it seems to imply that if you have the 'best' product, you will inevitably get the most sales.\n\nThe full phrase ends with \"even if your house is in the middle of the woods\". What it is *supposed* to mean, is that people will go through more of an effort to get a better product, but not that you will just randomly start getting sales if you have a good product. It's subtle, but I've heard people wildly misinterpret it in startup crowds.", "NTA. You had everything packed up and were literally in your car about to drive away. The fact that they thought the market closed an hour later is on them. One shitty review by an entitled customer who doesn't know how to look up what time the market closes won't reflect badly on you. I worked retail for years...did I unlock the door after closing to let a customer in to just get one thing quickly? No. They can come back tomorrow. Not your problem.", "NTA. Their inability to manage their time is not your problem. Do they expect you to be open and available 24 hours? Money doesn\u2019t matter here, it\u2019s about being courteous to *you* and seeing you as a person and not as a business. You are a human and you had a prior obligation. You are not to blame here. This person is expecting you to carry the burden of making up for their mistake. That is not your job.", "A small business owner here for over 20 years. I learned a long time ago, and even teach my staff, never try to explain or apologize to entitled people. It just makes it worse. Just say no and move on.  And don't let them get you down.  Their money isn't worth it.  NTA", "NTA. Some people really do think they're that special. Don't even waste the synapse function worrying about this.", "NTA. Entitled customers are the worst.", "Obviously NTA.  I mean, look at the actual thing they're mad about: that you have particular business hours, rather than being available at all times like a vending machine.

I repeated that explanation when they offered to follow me to my store and make a purchase while I was unloading.\n\nI think you made a tactical error in explaining, instead of stopping at, \"Sorry, the market's closed\".  Not that there's actually anything wrong with your reasons--it's just that unreasonable people treat a reason as an invitation to negotiate.  No explanation would have been good enough, because they weren't looking for an explanation: they were looking for something to argue against.  So, any reason you give just becomes something for them to grab onto--especially if you say anything that can be interpreted as meaning that it's technically possible, but would be a burden for you.  They just hear that as, \"I *could*, but I'm too lazy to do it/too stupid to figure it out/don't care about you\"--note their comments about a \"can do attitude\", \"should have tried harder\", etc.  (This is obviously shitty; there's nothing lazy, stupid, or uncaring about having particular business hours.)\n\nMore explanations just means they'll want to keep arguing and get more entrenched.  The more you engage, the more they see that they can keep you there.  You saw this in the way they offered to follow you to your store (to essentially have you open the store just for them), and argued that they could pay you later.\n\nNot that I think you should never give explanations or reasons, obviously!  Or that you should never give people the benefit of the doubt.  But when you spot this kind of thing happening, no reason to give them more ammo.", "NTA, and if you did accommodate them they certainly would not have left a positive review AND they would feel entitled to keep coming back after closing. Then, no matter how many times you take care of them, if you ever didn't bend over backwards they would have complained.", "NTA. All I read in this exchange is a potential customer's sense of entitlement. People seem to think that declaring themselves a \"customer\" means you, the salesperson or business owner, lose all sense of agency. You must, must, must do what the customer wants and provide just what the customer wants when he wants it.\n\nIn the real world, we know the customer is not always right.\n\nIt was galling that this person contacted you to declare what he/she \"might\" have spent. You're a business person. You deal with facts -- actual sales made DURING BUSINESS HOURS -- not the potential of a sale that might not occur or might be less than anticipated.\n\nI, too, believe you should not engage with this person on social media any further. All you're doing is providing ammunition in print that can be misconstrued and misquoted. When the exchange digresses to picking apart your \"tone\" you must concede you're in a losing fight. The issue has never been about your adherence to business hours and having a life outside of business. This is a potential customer having an electronic hissy fit.\n\nDon't engage.", "NTA, I bet if you talked to some of the other market vendors, they probably have similar stories about the same person.", "yup. i used to deal with this alllll the time working in the food court at the mall. after we closed and had all the grills and stuff shut off, register closed out to be counted for the day, etc, almost daily there\u2019d be someone trying to get food etc\n\nevery so often if the person wasn\u2019t a dick and was able to pay with cash, i\u2019d cook them a sandwich or fries if someone working was also cooking their dinner. or people that just wanted a soda, we\u2019d usually just give to them and say don\u2019t worry about it, again, if they weren\u2019t a dick. \n\nnothing wrong with asking, but don\u2019t be surprised when the answer is no.", "It sounds like they were after free stuff, don\u2019t give it another thought.", "Ha, so I thought the same thing while writing it all out, but it seemed more nuanced than \"a customer came by our store after we closed\" since I'm the owner and have full control.", "Honestly could have sworn I saw \u201cshe\u201d in the post.

OP, you have to accommodate me, the customer, even though I was late because I was in the hospital (not that you knew that or why it was so important to him to get your products at that moment). I will gloss over the fact that I did not care one whit what you (OP) needed to leave to attend to or whether the market would have a problem with you not clearing out on time.\n2. I know I am trustworthy and deserve to be trusted by everybody I deal with,\n3. My feedback is only constructive and has no tone to it; all my intentions and actions are above reproach. My comment that you didn't use your critical thinking skills cannot possibly read as an insult; it is only the calm, objective observation any rational person would make.,\n4. I approached you for help - not because you happened to still be there when I arrived late - but because I am really wanted you to have my business.\n\nMeanwhile, he does not see you as a human being, or even a business owner with any rights or any duty but to serve him:\n\n1. (Even though you were supposed to care about why he was late,) it didn't matter whether you had to leave on schedule to keep your own commitments.\n2. Your established closing time, the market's established closing time mean nothing to this man. They should not have mattered to you when you could be serving HIM.\n3. The fact that you were already fully packed up and would have to go to a fair bit of effort to dig out what he wanted should not matter to you when you could be serving HIM.\n4. The fact that it would have been problematic for you to take payment; should not have been issue for you. You should have naturally known that he would be good for the payment at whatever date in the future it would be convenient for him to show up with payment. (And had no problem accepting, at that later date, whatever he believed he had 'purchased' from him - because if there were any disagreement, a good business owner would naturally respect the customer's memory of what he purchased.\n5. All your valid reasons for not serving this customer after-hours? No, anyone who had more of a 'can-do' spirit would absolutely have risked getting on the bad side of the market operators, would have happily gone to the effort to find what he wanted, would have happily extended him credit, and would not have minded being late to/missing whatever important engagement he had.\n6. Of course, he knows your heart and can perfectly read into your typed words. He can hear the disingenuousness you typed in the words \"thank you\". The fact that you didn't presume a right to his continued business is your way of sneaking in an 'f' you.\n\nThis guy is going to find fault with any response you make and also find fault if you have no response. He would find fault with: \"thank you,\" \"got it,\" \"message received,\" \"I'm sorry you remain disappointed,\" no reply, etc. So go with whatever feels most right/satisfying to you and be content.\n\n\\*I tend to speak up more to share positive feedback. The most common response I get from the employee/manager is how rare that it is. I do that because (1) I truly appreciate what I consider great customer service and (2) why wouldn't I want to encourage that and uplift the folks who provide it? When I am raising a frustration I experienced as a customer; I keep in mind anything I did to contribute to the situation, and I recognize that I don't know every detail of what they were dealing with in that moment.", "NTA, this is some absolutely breathtaking entitlement.", "I'd suggest learning to tell people \"Fuck right off we're closed.\" and then sticking to that attitude rather than the obsequiousness displayed within the post. You're going to get to that point anyway but this way you get there a lot faster and thus don't waste your time with utter arseholes like the \"customer\" in the tale. Obviously NTA."]}
