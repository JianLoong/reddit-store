If she needs more bin space then she can either ask the council/landlord/whoever to upgrade or go to the dumpster and throw it there.\n\nHope this helps!", "NTA.

Why didn't she knock on your door before putting her trash in your bin", "NTA\n\nI have never had any problem with a neighbor coming over and asking if they can put an extra bag in my trash can or recycle bin. I always say yes. But if someone just started filling up my bin? I'd start putting it right back on their front doorstep.", "NTA, they should have asked, I come from a large family and we had that problem before and all we did was ask the neighbour and they were more then happy to put one bag one time in their bin on bin day", "NTA - Knocking on the door and having a discussion may have been a better way to handle it, but the way you handled it doesn't make you TA at all.  You pay for your trash, and she should pay for hers.  Letting her put stuff in the can the first time was neighborly.  Her taking advantage of it repeatedly is entitled.", "NTA.

You were just following their lead; they never spoke to you RE: using your trash can. They were fine doing it to you. You might want to mention something to the landlord to give them a heads-up in case that family tries to complain about you. Not that the landlord needs to do anything, but let the landlord know they are not friendly or neighborly. Her yelling was ridiculous And uncalled for.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property and you have the right to decide who uses the trash can. Your neighbor doesn't pay for it, doesn't own, and is rude to you so theres really no good reason for her to be using it.\n\nBesides her using your trash can is just going to lead to problems.

Yeah as someone else said you did the right by setting the boundary early and she needs to respect this.", "NTA.  Eff her.", "NTA - She has her own trash can.

If she produces that much trash, she should get a second trash bin, not steal services that don't belong to her.  Tell the landlord that the lady is leaving trash where it doesn't belong.  Most landlords have policies about that.  Considering how expensive it is to live in an apartment, I am not donating to anyone!  I pay for trash services, so I would be livid if a neighbor was doing that to me.", "Hahaha NTA. I'm sorry, but this kind of entitlement really grinds my gears. You were decent to let it go the first time, and she should have asked from the beginning. I can't believe she just popped it over the fence as well...", "NTA She put it on your side without saying anything.", "No, you're not the asshole. Speak to the landlord about it.

Sure, maybe talking first would have been *better* but it isn't necessary either.

The extra bag tags are only sold from like 11am-2pm on weekdays at one location (my work hours). And theyre $10 per bag anyways. Its a racket.\n\nWe have the biggest bin, but sometimes we foster kittens and run out of space (or we miss a pickup and then are 2 weeks behind...). Ive definitely eyed up my neighbors bins the morning of pickup day...havent done it yet though. But its tempting. Lol", "In cases like this, I'm sure that just asking nicely would've yielded much better responses in the long run. Some people are willing to help out if you just talk to them. Communication can solve so many problems if people would just engage each other.\n\nEven take Reddit as an example. Such a big corporation couldn't figure out how to communicate to its users and 3rd party apps how it was going to screw them over. With platforms like these, we the people are the products, and they own us and our content. We must do better, and frankly, we *can* do better.\n\nTake a platform [like this one](https://leofinance.io/threads/view/freecompliments/re-leothreads-2yyjsfjwx) (I found it just this week). Not only will you never have some greedy leader screwing over its members, but you own and control your own content. Nobody can take away your power to speak, and you get the opportunity to be paid every time you write a comment, and not be subjected to communicating with bots.
