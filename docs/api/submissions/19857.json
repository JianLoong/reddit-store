I can choose company A to pick up my trash, with multiple options of bin size and pick up on Tuesdays.  Or company B only has one size can, pickup on Fridays, but is cheaper.  Company C goes every other week for those that don't generate much trash.  Two of those three companies will actually get my bin from behind the fence so I don't have to have it out on the street.
