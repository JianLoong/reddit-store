I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about \"how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is.\" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.", "created_utc": 1684764810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13os3i5/aita_for_cooking_food_while_my_roommates/", "score": 1522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And what is his problem with you sharing food, which is something you've always done?  \n\nI have to admit, though, the \"no I wanna mow\" thing made me laugh.  What a manly man.", "So he\u2019s okay with you feeding him, but has a problem when you offer to feed his gf who just happens to be in the house. It\u2019s not like you only cook when she\u2019s there. \n\nWhy? Is he afraid you\u2019re gonna steal her with food? Is he afraid she\u2019s only hanging out with him because you feed her? \n\n Ask roomie what the problem is.

I liked taking my GF to visit him, we\u2019d spend the rest of the night talking about great food.

In his mind, the only logical solution is to... be mad at you for it.\n\nHe might be at a place where he could start changing his behavior permanently, to follow your example, so it might be worthwhile to check in with him (when his gf isn't around) to see if he wants to split the chores more equitably, and possibly even learn to cook, if you're willing to teach him by having him \"help\" when you're making something.", "I do feel sorry for your roomie, living with Mr Steal Your Girl, but NTA. \n\nDude needs to get his jealousy under control and/or ask you for lessons in cooking, mowing,  charming, and being hospitable.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate sounds like he has some issues and is worried his gf will recognize this after being around you.", "Keep cooking, but don't go out of your way to make your roomie's GF anything else special.\n\nHe's clearly ok with benefiting from your kindness himself, but he seems upset that his GF also gets to experience your courtesy and charm.\n\nHe's jealous and there's not much you can do.", "NTA, your roommates insecurity is not your problem. I\u2019m also from the south, and cooking and sharing food with others brings me a lot of joy. It was something you did out of kindness not out of a willingness to cause harm.

I wish sincerely that I could try your cooking, because I'd bet every horse in the track that it's absolutely delicious. (And if you have a tried and true recipe for NOLA style Voodoo Shrimp, pass that my way via my inbox please and thank you!!!)\n\nThat being said, unfortunately, a lot of people who didn't really grow up in that frame of mind where you feed your friends and guests and you scratch their backs while you're already scratching your own, this could all be coming off to your roommate as a big show-off. Especially if he never cooks or cleans or works in the yard for his girlfriend, your roommate probably feels emasculated by you doing these things with her around.\n\nI suggest you chat with him, see what he has to say, and maybe just slow down a little. I know, I know, I'm asking you to burn down the church here. Not feed a guest?! How rude!! My grandmother would roll in her grave. But just consider, tension between roommates is really strenuous, especially when that tension is caused over a sexual/romantic partner and \"marked\" territory. Just see what he has to say and do what you have to do to get by until she leaves.\n\nSuch a shame. She sounds like a lovely girl, and seems so appreciative of your efforts. Maybe your roommate DOES have a reason to worry! Hahaha", "NTA. If your roommate is feeling inadequate, that's a HIM problem. His GF being impressed by your cooking and generosity as something out of the ordinary for her is probably a good thing for her to raise her standards a bit.", "Nta sounds like he's insecure of himself and sees you  as competition.", "NTA. It sounds like your roommate is jealous of your cooking abilities and generosity. It probably makes him feel guilty somehow but his feelings are not yours to manage.

Give him ideas if he wants to improve baking or so. I think he is just very insecure", "NTA. I'm from Texas and what you describe is the way things are. You're not over stepping. You're being southern polite. He just doesn't like that you make him look bad. That's his issue, not yours.", "Roommate feels threatened by your generosity.  That's his burden to bear. NTA to be nice to people.", "NTA. Your roommate is just jealous and is trying to make himself look better in front of his gf.

Something along those lines. Let this serve as a mini wake up call for him to light a fire under his butt for his gf so to speak. You're doing nothing wrong.", "NTA. Sounds like you have good manners! And are a good cook. It\u2019s not your problem that this makes your roommate feel some sort of (unhealthy) way about it.", "You did some thing nice and now your asshole? Yikes...your friend is jealous hun..you made a cake specially for his lady friend...and now it all sh talks about...you're not the asshole..but you might want to rethink the friendship", "MMMMMMMMMMMM...

He doesn't want to do all these things, but knows it's attractive to his gf. He might pick up doing some of this stuff to impress her, but after awhile... it'll go back to him not wanting to and at some point he won't feel he needs to impress her. She'll get fed up after that.", "NTA if you offer things to both of them. If your roommate is so fragile that you can't go about being you in their presence, he's an AH. You should be aware enough not to try to hang out with his girlfriend independently. Although, if she's living there, you're bound to run into each other, and you should just treat her politely.\n\nMost of your post is completely irrelevant.\n\nYour roommate could be kind of overstepping for having someone stay for weeks at a time.

I think he realises that a guy who takes care of his home and cooks will be ten times as attractive to other women, and he isn't that guy. But he can't both have his cake and eat it, too. He can either continue not being that guy, have his girlfriend eventually realise this and dump him, or he can get off his lazy behind and start developing some useful life skills and habits.\n\nIn any case, his current attempts at concealing the truth are... entertaining for us, side observers. I just hope his gf has her eyes wide open.", "Do you want to live with me?", "NTA. Your roommate is a insecure and immature child.

You are being so very kind, but you\u2019re roommate is feeling insecure. \n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d stop doing any of it for your roommate whether his gf is there or not. He\u2019s being ungrateful and immature, and needs to learn that he can\u2019t take advantage of you when it suits him.", "NTA, this is a him problem. He could\u2019ve just talked to you about it beforehand instead of just getting angry. Dude needs to step up his game.", "NTA, but why did you choose to make the specific cheesecake she said she liked?", "NTA but how did you manage to put two spaces between paragraphs and yet still make me read a wall of text?", "I\u2019m not going to lie, this probably just comes down to cultural differences. I\u2019m going to try to be reasonable with you though OP. I can tell that you\u2019re not a bad guy. \n\nYour roommate may be a little insecure, but some of it is reasonable. He probably just doesn\u2019t know how to deal with your actions because they are out of the ordinary for the northeast and he is probably not too smart or good with his words. That does not mean that he can\u2019t be partially right. It\u2019s a grey issue. Listen. The things you\u2019re doing, if done by someone from the northeast, I would consider a step too far. Where I come from, if your friend has his gf over, you step aside for him to provide for her. You don\u2019t go over his head to provide for her. That is disrespectful to him. The key is to not go over his head as her provider.\n\nThat being said, I think if you mow the lawn every time, then it\u2019s completely normal that you continue to do it. It\u2019s your roommates fault for not doing 50% of the mowing. It\u2019s weird of him to want to pretend to her that he mowes when she\u2019s not around. That\u2019s insecure.\n\nBut with the car wash thing and the food thing, you over stepped. You cooking her special dishes that she specifically likes is overstepping as you\u2019re treating her like a boyfriend would treat a girlfriend. She is not \u201cyour\u201d guest. She is \u201chis\u201d guest. There\u2019s a difference. IMO, if someone does things like this for someone else\u2019s girl, there is usually a side-motive. But I get it, you\u2019re from the south and that\u2019s how you were brought up. No biggy. Just adapt because you are surrounded by a new culture now. \n\nI know guys that will do these things and pretend that they\u2019re just being friendly when they don\u2019t offer these services to anyone else or anyone else\u2019s girlfriend. It\u2019s a tactic to steal someone\u2019s girl or just \u201cwin\u201d her over even if he\u2019s not going to make a move. It may be a power thing. Idk. I don\u2019t understand it. But I do know that being in your position, you have the advantage of being the good guy on paper. That\u2019s how the person in your position usually gets away with it and people call the other person insecure. Resist the temptation to use this advantage. Seek the truth and goodness with honor.\n\nSo overall, (and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a good guy), just be mindful of the cultural norms up here in the northeast. But also don\u2019t be too afraid of upsetting him if he truly is insecure (which he may be). That\u2019s not your problem if he freaks out over you mowing the lawn. Continue to mow if that\u2019s what you want to do. Just stop cooking her special cheesecake and offering to wash their car like you\u2019re her boyfriend. There\u2019s nuance here. The key is to be self aware and be honorable. Good luck OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Someone from NE was all confused about your kindness, but they deleted their comments while I was writing mine, so here's what I was going to reply.\n\nFrom the Midwest, dating a Southerner, going to school in NE. The stuff OP is doing is literally just doing a chore he was already doing for a little longer (washing cars) and doing something he enjoys doing and maybe practicing skills he doesn't get to use often (cooking and making cheesecake). All of the stuff is a \"might as well\" decision, not necessarily a \"how do I be a shining example so that my roommate's GF starts getting ideas about leaving him for me.\"\n\n\nSouthern hospitality, as I see it, is just doing a little extra if it don't hurt ya none. Experience in the NE has shown me that that kind of outlook isn't as common up there. There's kindness for sure, but it's been very rare that a NE native has gone out of their way for me unless they're getting paid. My Midwest Nice gets a little in my way sometimes, like holding doors for people while I'm carrying stuff and people just keep coming on through, or spending 12 hours driving a UHaul and moving boxes for people. \n\nI'm not saying people from the NE aren't ever kind or hospitable or what have you, but it's just a cultural difference, and there's plenty of outliers in both directions.\n\nAlso, OP's kindness was largely practical for him as a culinary student, enjoyable since he likes cooking, and for all we know he could have seen washing the extra cars as repaying roomie for mowing the lawn.", "NTA.

They have never washed a car, but I do think they would like it. They are short, so you'll have to do the tops of the cars. Watch the 2 year old with the hose; he can be reckless. The only catch is that they can't go out and drink, but I'm sure we could find a workaround. I think my family is a much better fit than your current roommate. Sometimes we are assholes, but we can learn to be nicer.", "This! NTA. If he\u2019s so upset, he should do better instead of expecting you to dilute yourself.", "This is exactly what I thought OP !\n\nHe doesn't want his girlfriend to compare how he treats her vs how she could be treated. \n\nKeep going, you sound like a great roommate and he's being an asshole. \n\nNTA.", "\"Don't do nice things for my girlfriend\" how does this mf not see he's the asshole?", "I was also kinda curious if maybe OP is the better looking guy in this story.\n\nHot young dude, sweating in the sun over a mower? Maybe drenched and taking his shirt off while washing not only his car, but her car too?\n\nCant have any hot shirtless guys glistening in the sun while the GF is around!", "This is exactly the truth. You are NTA because you\u2019re just being you. He is being a jealous person who seemingly doesn\u2019t want to actually do anything to impress his girlfriend.

It's a bit concerning that roommate scowls at girlfriend when she steps out of line. Keep up being kind and generous. Clearly, this girl needs to see she can do better.", "Right, maybe his GF will figure out that she deserves better.", "It\u2019s all that insecurity. You do things naturally he either can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to do. He\u2019ll be getting the inevitable comparisons soon enough and he can\u2019t live with the fact that he\u2019s inferior or unwilling in those departments. Keep that bar high.

I don\u2019t see the issue with sharing your cooking, offering to wash their cars or mowing the lawn. It\u2019s like I\u2019m already doing mine, want me to grab yours? The lawn mowing kills me because he must really feel insecure that he needs to do this. Maybe girlfriend has hinted or said some nice things about him.", "Seconded this - take the hospitality a step further and ask if he wants to learn how to do the various things he sees you do and feels insecure about.
