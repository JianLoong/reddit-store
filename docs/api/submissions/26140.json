It really helped me to gain perspective on my situation. Nearly 4 four months later, here's the update\r  \n\r  \nAfter intense reflection, I decided to stick with my prior engagement and go to the wedding. I called Julia to explain briefly the situation, also called her parents to apologize and tell that I'll come to pay my respect to them and to Dan's grave once I'll get my car back. They were very understanding.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAmelia was still mad at me though. She blamed me for being \u00ab tempted \u00bb by Julia and her family, again after the wedding, for pulling the long face, I was still very hurt by Dan's death, so yeah I wasn't at my best. Our relationship was really going sour, I felt she wasn't supporting me while I was grieving my friend but she wasn't on the same page. I started to see a new side of her and perphaps we weren't meant to be. After another argument, we broke up, 1-2 weeks after the wedding. She tried to salvage our relationship but the damage was permanent. At this point, I was at my lowest, totally devastated, in just a few weeks, I lost my friend and my relationship, I was really in a bad place.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nFew days after, I got my car back, luckily it was a minor issue, it didn't cost me much. Once I got a weekend off, I visited Dan's grave and his parents. They gifted me his stethoscope, it meant a lot to me. Julia was also there, and we all remembered our memories with Dan, very nice and emotional moments. I felt very bad about missing the funeral but his family convinced me that what mattered was how I was present for him during his life.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAfter that trip, I started to hang out with Julia again, it just happened naturally, even after several years, I have to admit that we still have a deep bond. Nothing romantic though, we are both grieving Dan, and I just ended my relationship with Amelia. We both agreed that rushing into a relationship would be a bad idea. Currently, we enjoy spending time as friends.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nStep by step, I started to feel better, the pain is still there but I'm learning to live with it. I try to enjoy my life, to improve as a man and as a resident every day. I'm lucky to have a great support group to rely on, especially one of my co-resident who really stepped up and is becoming an awesome friend, I'm currently living with him until I find a new apartment.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI had almost no contact with Amelia since the breakup, probably for the best. I was quite bitter at one point, wondering how I went from thinking to propose her to breaking up in just a few weeks but with time I got closure. I know I have my fair share of responsability, but it is what it is.\r  \n\r  \nThe past is the past and now I look to the future with hope and optimism", "created_utc": 1693746078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168wfnl/update_wibta_for_going_to_the_funeral_of_my_ex/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Some of these comments make me sad for humanity.

It\u2019s not easy to waste two years of your life on someone still stuck on their ex. Hopefully everyone will end up where they belong.", "This was the outcome that was expected when you made the decision to go to the funeral without considering your now ex-girlfriend feelings on spending time with your ex and her family, days after the funeral.\nYou decided to go to the wedding after the callout  pressure, but you're using Amelia's lack of support to your grief as an excuse to validate your wanting to explore your possible relationship with Julia. And look who's back in your life now. You got what you wanted. It just sucks when people who aren't ready to move on get to hurt people first before they verbalize what they really want.", "Why are y\u2019all ignoring the fact that Dan was his ACTUAL FRIEND to fix your mouth to say \u201cAmelia was right!?\u201d His friend died and she was focused solely on the ex if I was OP I would\u2019ve broke up with her too. My close friend died and you worried bout an EX!?!? \ud83d\ude10", " Going to someone's funeral is a way to pay them your respects, one last time. It brings some closure to the attendant, and a bit of  comfort to the grieving family.  \n  I am glad you managed to visit your friend's grave and met his family, and I think Amelia's insecurities and attitude caused your break up as a self fulfilling prophesy.\n   NTA,  thanks for the up date.", "Dan was your friend, you should have been allowed to grieve and supported in your grief by Amelia. \n\nI'm glad you sound like you're in a good place now though", "I knew Amelia was correct and this was the outcome since the 1st post, so no need for update like at all", "I think many comments here are too harsh on OP. Please remind yourself that grief is very hard to deal with and not all of us deal with it in the same way. Grief messes with our minds and our decision making, it was a devastating period for OP, and even if you may not agree with his decisions, it's not the point anymore. I hope OP can move on into the future with my best wishes.", "So Amelia was right if you are hanging with Julia again \ud83d\udc80", "I'm sorry that you missed Dan's funeral. His family was right, what matters is that you showed up in Dan's life. I'm glad you were able to remember Dan with them. Grief is hard. \n\nDan also gave you one last gift in a way, as the situation enabled you to see Amelia's true colours and get out of a bad relationship. Good luck with everything going forwards.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well. Breaking up with Amelia was a good call", "Amelia is so better off without you.", "As I see, Dan was not only your ex's brother, he was your friend, Amelia turn it into a fight between girls instead of supporting your loss even after choosing to go with her to the wedding. You weren't and aren't the a.s. in all this situation, glad you're feeling better now.", "Wow. So Amelia was right all along. I had a feeling. Damn. I feel so so sorry for her. Hopefully at least after all this, she can move on.", "You can be bitter about your ex, and I get it, but what\u2019s happening with you and Julie was personally her concern. Some part of her knew it.\n\nAnd though you\u2019re saying, you guys are remaining friends for us to see, you could be with her. A month ago you were with Amelia   I would suggest maybe slowing everything down and taking some time to yourself.\n\nAs far as Amelia, she was trying to stake her turf, and the selfish the truth of the matter is, I believe she had an intuitive spark, that this was a possibility all along.  So before you get bitter about her, she was not wrong you just didn\u2019t like it.  As far as your friend I\u2019m sorry you lost your friend. Good luck in the future.", "Nta, you can always get remarried, but you can never get re-funeraled", "Clearly Amelia was not the right person for you, as her values were different than yours. You would have understood if the situation was reversed, and she did not and held it against you. Neither of you were wrong, just different values. I hope you keep your distance with Julia, as this is way to complicated history and now with the death, it will bond you in an artificial way. Good luck !", "Honestly did not expect these kinds of comments.\n\nOP's friend died and was stuck with an ultimatum, still went to the wedding for his ex gf's sake, and y'all are hung up on Amelia \"being right\"?\n\nAre y'all purposely ignoring the part where Amelia was unsupportive of OP's grieve, was mad at him for being unhappy on a wedding, the day his friend's funeral took place, and at the end still couldn't understand what OP had felt?\n\nOP and Julia forming a bond isn't Amelia being right, it's the result of Amelia's unsupportiveness of OP's grieve. If Amelia would have been more supportive (just like any good partner would be after their partner lost a good friend), there wouldn't be the sourness OP talked about, that eventually led to the break up.", "OP I\u2019m sorry people are being so rude. You dodge a bullet with Amelia. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your friend. Grief does bring people closer again. It\u2019s hard to be with someone who dismisses that. I hope you can heal with time\n\nEdit: spelling", "I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend, and your relationship.", "Glad she dodged a bullet - you. She was right all along.", "You are definitely better off without Amelia. You decided to stick with her in the end yet she was ungrateful for it and gave you a hard time for not putting on a fake happy face at her sister's wedding.", "Honestly,  I'm not surprised Amelia broke up with you. You were really torn between a prior commitment of current gf's family wedding and the funeral of an EX's brother? She saw the reality. The fact that you're dating Julie again is proof she saw something you didn't. It's best you didn't propose.", "So clearly Amelia was RIGHT to question your true motives. Amelia is the lucky one and yes, YOU\u2019RE ABSOLUTELY THE ASSHOLE. This had nothing to do with Dan and everything to do with Julia.", "To everyone saying \u201cAmelia was right\u201d, you\u2019re all missing the fucking point. OP\u2019s **best friend** died. IN A CAR ACCIDENT. While OP is in the middle of his grief, his GF was worried about him being \u201ctempted\u201d by Julia when that is NOWHERE CLOSE to being the case. If I were OP, I would have broken up with her too. \n\nHad you all not had your heads so far up your asses, you would\u2019ve gotten to see from OP\u2019s perspective.", "If you were so conflicted about your past with Julia vs your future with Amelia, she is right to have ended things.", "I am actually happy for Amelia she dodged a bullet. May she finds true love \ud83d\ude0c", "Only thing I find weird is that your ex showed up at your house, after no contact, to tell you of her brothers loss, who she also didn\u2019t know you remained friends with. Why would she bother to come tell you specifically in person?\n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your friend, that is without any question, a shorty situation.\n\nIt does seem suspect that you are now suddenly friends again with your ex and contemplating re-kindling your romance. And that this ended your close to engagement relationship. I\u2019m guessing your \u2018new\u2019 ex was onto something.", "Thank you for the update. I'm saddened to know that you gave into your girlfriend's theatrics. Other commenters made a really good point that there my have been unresolved feelings. That may be the case, and if so, I'm glad you found your way back to one another. \n\nThat being said, I think that the thought process of you being the bullet that Amelia dodged is a load of horse poo. If those feelings were there, they were bound to come out again at some point,  most likely at a time when you each had invested more into the relationship, causing more damage in the long run. This sped up the process and made more for a clean break for all involved. Everything happens for a reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you all the best and much peace, internet friend. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You only get one funeral, whereas you can always offer to attend her next wedding.", "Thank you for the update. Amelia? Good riddance!!!", "NTA", "I'm so glad you broke up with Amelia.

It probably validated everything your ex was saying tho. Not sure how different the outcome would have been if your ex had no problem with you attending the funeral and you meeting up with the other ex.\n\nChances are it would have been the exact same outcome.", "Not surprised that you and Julia are rekindling a relationship. Shared grief and a passionate past relationship often leads to this and Amelia knew it.\n\nESH\nAmelia for giving you crap after the wedding especially since your grief is valid.\nYou for not recognizing that Dan's death greatly changes the dynamic between you and Julia.", "OP I think you need to be honest with yourself and admit that some part of you was excited about Julia and her parents being back in your life. Even if it was subconscious, even if in your mind it was about connecting with people who also loved Dan, I'm sure it was clear as day to Amelia.\n\nYou say she tried to salvage the relationship, but did you? You wanted to marry this woman, did you even try to look into ways of building back support and trust? Consider seeing a relationship counselor?\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, I truly am, and I'm not saying Amelia wasn't wrong in some aspect, but I think it's incredibly unfair of you to try and paint her as the bad guy, especially when it's clear all her fears were warranted.\n\n**Edit** I realize this comment sounds like it dismisses OP's very real grief over his close friend, and I just want to make clear that I don't at all deny that OP was grieving and deserved comfort and support during his grief.", "[deleted]", "Another one of these where the man clearly continues to pine over the ex, the current gf sees it, yet current is the evil one.

Personally I\u2019d have supported you going to your friends funeral. If it turned out that you rekindled your relationship with your ex then I\u2019d know it wasn\u2019t meant to be between us. If my partner berated me for my grief even after getting her way, I\u2019d be so done. \nI\u2019d encourage you to go extremely slow with Julia. Grief can color a lot of things. Remembering Dan together feels good but don\u2019t let it stop you from talking about what was NOT good between you. \nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, take the time you need to put yourself back together before jumping into anything else.", "Yeah I've been having a problem with the comments acting like Dan is just an ex gf's little brother, when in reality he was a good friend and OP mentored him. If you rephrase it to attending a funeral of a friend over the wedding of SIL I feel like people would be supporting OP going to the funeral. Everyone is hung up on the ex gf's little brother part.", "These comments *really* don't want to see the nuance of the situation.\n\n\"OP wanted to, and had a *right* to, mourn the loss of his friend and deserved support at that moment\" can be just as true as \"OP clearly still had unresolved feelings for his ex and Amelia could see that\"", "Thank you so much!", "Yep. Sometimes the gf can look like an asshole because other people don\u2019t see what she sees.  \n\nI always had a sense that one of my exes wasn\u2019t over his previous fianc\u00e9e.

I swear some of these comments have to be coming from 16 year olds.", "People like you are absolutely disgusting supporting Amelia.\n\nIf my SO prevented me from going to a funeral for a friend, she wouldn't be significant for much longer.  Instead of understanding that him and his ex are bonding over a shared trauma (which in itself is actually very unfortunate), you jump on the fact that Amelia was right.\n\nNo, she was very and unequivocally wrong. Had she been supportive of his loss and grieving process and not a jealous gremlin, she would still have a relationship.  \n\nOP mentored this person he lost and shared a relationship after the fact that the original relationship was over, and all you can do is jump down his throat for having someone to grieve with. \n\nIt's absolutely asinine.", "Sorry, what? He went to the wedding and visited the grave at a later date.\n\nDid we read the same post?", "THANK YOU. This man\u2019s close friend!! Just died!!

He could\u2019ve grieved his friend privately, without his ex (or rather, soon to be gf).

She didn\u2019t support him going to the funeral because she knew it was really about his feelings for Julia. And look at that! Now he and Julia are in love again and she was absolutely right about the whole situation.", "Fucking bonkers anyone would think a wedding would have priority over the funeral of a close friend. Some people on reddit need to get outside a little bit more. The fact he still went to the wedding should have been enough. The now ex girlfriend was to insecure to recognize that the guy just lost an extremely close friend in a very traumatic way and pushed him away. She got what she deserved, which is him ending things. If in the end he ends up reconnecting with his previous ex well thats just the way she goes. If Amelia had of been there for him to begin with it probably never happens.", "One has to be quite flexible to reach that far.\n\nI don't blame his ex gf for feeling insecure, but\n\n1) OP was stuck with an ultimatum\n2) OP at the end chose the wedding for his gf's sake\n3) in result to that, he got to miss his friend's funeral\n4) in result to that, he obviously gets sad (at the wedding) \n5) in result to that, she gets pissed because be is sad??(at the wedding) (unless i misunderstood that, cmiiw) \n6) in result to that, their relationship is sour and they break up 2 weeks later\n\nYes, OP eventually visits Dan's grave and reconnects with Julia, which DOES suggest that there were some unresolved feelings, but putting the sole blame of the breakup on OP and saying she dodged a bullet is unfair given the situation he was stuck with, and how unreasonable she was about things that had nothing to do with Julia (e. g. being sad at the wedding).", "I\u2019m just saying Amelia probably doesn\u2019t see it the same way he does.  It\u2019s tremendously suspicious that Julie, who doesn\u2019t know Dan and OP are still friends, would suddenly show up at his apartment after what seems a bad breakup, bad enough with her parents are involved.  Do you show up in person at your ex\u2019s place whom you\u2019ve had no contact, after some sort of tragedy or event?"]}
