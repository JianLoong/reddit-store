{"id": 26624, "submission_id": "16f902b", "title": "AITA for crying when my (27f) husband (27m) made a joke about my dessert?", "selftext": "Throwaway. We've been married for 3 months after 3 year relationship. We are still getting used to live together.\n\nMy husband is a jokester. He makes jokes a lot. For example, when I cook, he's like \"you eat first, if you're alive I'll eat next\" something like that. That one is fine.\n\nTomorrow he's starting gym and diet. So today he asked if I can make some dessert so he can enjoy for the last time for a while. I'm a good cook and I love cooking, so I said okay but I'll make something light (he suggested waffles but didn't insist.)\n\nToday I made some mini cheesecakes in the cups. My first time making it. I used homemade yoghurt so it was a little sour, but I still liked it. I worked on the visuals and sweet taste and it turned out quiet good for a first timer.\n\nHe ate it, he made comments how it was a bit sour, which I already acknowledged. He then said \"you just made me hate desserts now\" and \"because this was not what I envisioned for tonight\" chuckled. \n\nI was so offended by this. I started staring off and crying. I put effort on this thing even though I never did this before. He always encourages me to try something new and I did it. \n\nHe then tried to lighten the mood how he was just joking, saying he expected me to say \"well don't it eat it then\". He complained how I take everything so seriously and we both got angry.\n\nI honestly just expected a \"thank you for making this, even though not what I expected, I still appreciate\". But no, he has to joke first.\n\nHe usually says thank you when I cook for breakfast and dinner and anything else.\n\nI'm just so tired with work and house chores and I wanted to do something nice for my husband and this is the reaction I received. I'm usually okay with his jokes and get along with them, but sometimes I can't take it. Sometimes all I want is to be treated like a princess. We are supposed to be still in our honeymoon phase but sometimes it doesn't feel like it.\n\nSo, AITA for crying when he made this joke?", "created_utc": 1694373706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f902b/aita_for_crying_when_my_27f_husband_27m_made_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That he\u2019s a funny guy is great, but it sounds like jokes about your cooking are off limits - and that\u2019s okay!! If you put effort into making food for someone, the LEAST they can do is be polite and respectful regardless of whether or not they like it. \n\nThe worst thing my husband has ever said about my cooking (and I\u2019ve made some truly horrible things, tbh) is, \u201cIt\u2019s not my favorite.\u201d He knows me well enough to know that if he insults me/my cooking, I\u2019m likely to never cook for him again.", "ESH\n\nHe jokes way too much to the point it\u2019s just insulting.
