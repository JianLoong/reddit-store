We've been married for 3 months after 3 year relationship. We are still getting used to live together.\n\nMy husband is a jokester. He makes jokes a lot. For example, when I cook, he's like \"you eat first, if you're alive I'll eat next\" something like that. That one is fine.\n\nTomorrow he's starting gym and diet. So today he asked if I can make some dessert so he can enjoy for the last time for a while. I'm a good cook and I love cooking, so I said okay but I'll make something light (he suggested waffles but didn't insist.)\n\nToday I made some mini cheesecakes in the cups. My first time making it. I used homemade yoghurt so it was a little sour, but I still liked it. I worked on the visuals and sweet taste and it turned out quiet good for a first timer.\n\nHe ate it, he made comments how it was a bit sour, which I already acknowledged. He then said \"you just made me hate desserts now\" and \"because this was not what I envisioned for tonight\" chuckled. \n\nI was so offended by this. I started staring off and crying. I put effort on this thing even though I never did this before. He always encourages me to try something new and I did it. \n\nHe then tried to lighten the mood how he was just joking, saying he expected me to say \"well don't it eat it then\". He complained how I take everything so seriously and we both got angry.\n\nI honestly just expected a \"thank you for making this, even though not what I expected, I still appreciate\". But no, he has to joke first.\n\nHe usually says thank you when I cook for breakfast and dinner and anything else.\n\nI'm just so tired with work and house chores and I wanted to do something nice for my husband and this is the reaction I received. I'm usually okay with his jokes and get along with them, but sometimes I can't take it. Sometimes all I want is to be treated like a princess. We are supposed to be still in our honeymoon phase but sometimes it doesn't feel like it.\n\nSo, AITA for crying when he made this joke?", "created_utc": 1694373706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f902b/aita_for_crying_when_my_27f_husband_27m_made_a/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was definitely an AH but if he has made exactly the same jokes in the past and you've responded to them fine then I expect he was surprised when you suddenly started crying about it. \n\nMore importantly ignore all the idiots telling you to divorce him. From the sounds of it they wouldn't know a serious relationship if it punched them in the mouth. If making stupid jokes is the worst he has done then breaking up is like dropping a nuke on a knife fight. He was definitely inconsiderate but it's not something that needs that kind of response. Have a serious discussion with him and set boundaries. If you've been together for 3 years and even got married then I'll go out on a limb and say it's not the first time something has gone wrong. But if he values you then tell him what you feel is fine and what isn't (because he clearly doesn't know and you haven't made it apparent from the sounds of it) and he'll tone it back though he may slip up at times because he's already grown accustomed to it after 3 years of already doing it with no sort of backlash. If it bothered you that much then you should've nipped it in the bud a long time ago. \n\nHowever I would say you were a bit stupid too. If this was his last pudding for a long time and he suggested something then you definitely should've made that and not completely disregarded his opinion and decided to experiment with what's going to be his last memory of pudding for a while. Bit of a strong comparison but imagine a death row inmate asks for a steak as his last meal and instead gets sushi. I wouldn't be surprised if that disappointed him but he didn't say anything. Equally if you're a good cook like you say then you should've probably worked out that sour yoghurt is not a good idea to put in a cheesecake and I definitely would've expected a comment or two about it if I did that. Cheesecake should not be sour. In that situation my taste for pudding would certainly be damaged. \n\nHe was rude for not thanking you but as you've stated, he normally does so just take it as a mistake. This doesn't sound like it's malicious. It just sounds like he tried to make light of a situation he wasn't all too happy about and ended up going too far or, to coin a phrase, it was the straw that broke the camel's back.Please don't divorce over some slightly sour cakes and a stupid comment. Both of you need to be the adults you are and work it out civilly. Staring off and crying is the worst thing you can do and trying to make light of it was the worst thing he could do. You should've calmly told him that it was out of line and he should've calmly apologized. If you really want to spend your life with him then please communicate. There are going to be bumps in a relationship and even moreso in a marriage so it's important to deal with a problem there and then before it ripples into something bigger. Honestly this just sounds like both of you did something slightly stupid and external factors lead to this blowing way out of proportion. I don't know if you intend to show this to your bf as well but if you do then I hope he sees this and realises that casual jokes can be funny but thoughtless ones can potentially just be hurtful instead.", "NTA \n\nA joke is funny to everyone involved. These aren\u2019t jokes, they\u2019re put downs and you have a problem with them which is rational.", "You need to sit him down in a non joke moment and tell him sternly to lay off the jokes! Or else there will be bigger problems.", "NTA. My husband and I often make these kinds of jokes. And it's okay because we both find it funny and laugh, but sometimes, inadvertently we touch a soft spot, or we push it further than we should. And the other person gets offended or feels hurt. \n\nIt can be disconcerting at first because \"how am I supposed to know that *this time* was not the right time to make a joke?\"\n\nBut we figured out that it's okay not to know. As long as you know how to make it right. So in this situation, my husband would say\n\n\"Oh, love. I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings? I was trying to be funny. Your dessert was lovely. I'm so happy you made something for me today. You are an amazing cook. I'm the luckiest man in the world\"\n\nAnd I'd say something like\n\n\"Yeah, right. You say this now because you are afraid I'll put poison in your food tomorrow.\" And we move on.\n\nIf you don't usually mind him joking around, talk to him how you'd like him to behave when he touches a nerve. What shouldn't happen is that he blames it on you and makes you feel like your feelings don't matter. And I'm sure he doesn't mean to do that, he's just confused and doesn't know how to react.\n\nIf he regularly acts like your feelings don't matter and/or says that you're overreacting, then that's a different story.", "He gets his kicks off of putting you down.

Sounds to me like you want the credit of doing something for him, while actually doing whatever you wanted. If you didnt want/could make waffles you could just tell him and ask him for other suggestions or buy them from somewhere.   \n\n\nIf, for example, you were going to go vegan for health reasons and wanted a last amazing meat dish and even suggested you wanted a steak, and your husband served you a boiled chicken breast you would probably be disapointed.  \n\n\nIn terms of his answer I would personally not appreciate it, however you said yourself he does this often and you dont mind it, so you now having a problem with it doesnt make it his fault.

This joke doesn't sound any more biting than the \"if you're still alive\" joke you said you don't mind, so I can see how your husband might not think he was out of bounds. But if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, and that's valid. That said, it doesn't sound like you enjoy this kind of humor at all, merely that you have come to tolerate some of it. If so, you should talk to him about it. And if he sticks by the \"you take everything so seriously\" line, then I'll change my ruling to n-t-a.", "No, not an AH, just human.

He should learn to handle it better because jokes like that are annoying and an AH move if he does it all the time, but at the same time he suggested waffles and to be honest the sour cheesecake reminds me of a bitter lemon meringue pie I recently was expected to eat and enjoy. For us recipes that don't turn out nicely can become an inside joke but maybe you're not in that place yet. If that's the case he needs to learn to convey this in a more honest way and leave the jokes behind and you need to at least be open to criticism unless you want him to eat things that don't taste nice and pretend that he likes them for the rest of his life.", "If only one of you ever laughs at his jokes, they aren\"t funny.
