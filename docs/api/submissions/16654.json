Walk away. \n\nThis man isn't listening to your wants, needs or desires. He thinks you're thinking too hard about the object that is meant to be the symbol of your love. \n\nHe's re-using a ring he gave to his previous wife. That's insulting. He can't even bother to get you something for yourself? He figuratively dug around in the junk drawer until he found something that would get the job done, and nothing more.\n\nDo you want a man who only does the bare minimum and then complains when you don't think it's good enough? \n\nHe thinks you just want a bigger diamond. So he thinks you're shallow and materialistic? That's what he's implying when he says that. He's also implying he *knows* the stone is inadequate and small, but he doesn't want to put out the effort to change that issue. He just makes it a you problem. \n\nHe doesn't care about sentiment, or your feelings, and he doesn't know enough about you. \n\nA proposal is a very important life ceremony. And it's one most people never stop to consider all the meanings of. \n\nA proposal is someone's way of saying, \"I choose you to be my forever. Will you agree?\"\n\nFar more than the wedding, the proposal is ALL about the proposee. The proposer has already made their decision. They are purposely trying to woo you into agreeing to accompany them through life. \n\nThey pick the place, the time, they set the atmosphere, they supply the ring. Each of these elements are important, because they should all cater to the proposee. \n\nThey should all say \"See how well I know you? See how much I care about what you want? See how I've gone through all this effort to make this about you? I want you comfortable. I want you happy. Pick me! You will not be sorry.\"\n\nNote: I have said nothing about price or traditional trappings. If your ideal proposal is a ringpop at a junkyard? Fantastic! The expense is not the issue. The fancy clothes and dinner are not the issue. \n\nThe issue is: is the proposer willing to sacrifice their wants/needs/comfort/desires for one single day just to make you happy?\n\nIf your boyfriend can't even give you a ring you like and want to wear, what's he going to act like when it comes to buying a house or car?", "NTA - I\u2019m already weird about the idea of taking the ring from the mom to wear it, but wearing the ring he\u2019s already given to his ex is too much. It feels cursed.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s the thing: an engagement ring is an important symbol of love (and, traditionally, the capacity to support a future wife). If he doesn\u2019t care or disparages your feelings on something as symbolic and big as the engagement ring, you need to run because there\u2019s a reason that ring is cursed.", "NTA - you\u2019re the one who has to wear it everyday! \n\nI agree w/the other redditor who pointed out the fact that he is not listening to you/assuming you want a bigger ring is also concerning. Means he is not at all getting your real message (and is projecting weird assumptions onto you in the process)", "NTA, it\u2019s already been on his first wife\u2019s finger, if you have a daughter it can be passed to her.\n\nSo he says your putting too much thought into it, which is code for\u2026he wants you to accept it because that\u2019s easy and free for him. Listen I think the concept of engagement rings is ridiculous but I can tell you I would never wear that ring.\n\nTell him you\u2019ll never wear it if that\u2019s what he proposes with, even better take a hard look at how worried you are about how he feels. It sounds like you make yourself smaller for him. What ages are you?", "NTA\n\nIt being a family ring isn\u2019t your problem, it\u2019s that his first wife wore it first. If he can\u2019t comprehend that you don\u2019t want to start your marriage with his ex wife\u2019s ring he\u2019s either really ignorant or just doesn\u2019t listen to you.", "NTA\n\nIf it was not an heirloom, he'd probably get it. He needs to understand it was still the ring of a former *wife* of him, and it certainly was not chosen with you in mind\n\nIt could have been n a h, because him wanting to use the ring because it's an heirloom is just as valid as you not wanting it because it belonged to his ex. It's both build on emotions\n\nNow for him saying you want a bigger diamond, that feels like gaslighting. Maybe he doesn't want to spend money on a new one when he can just get this one for free? Or he uses it to manipulate you to do as he wants.\n\nBut what makes it especially NTA is because he can't -or doesn't want to- understanding your feelings. He's not even trying to understand them, he is *dismissing* your feelings. That is not a good start, and makes him the asshole", "NTA/NAH\n\nI understand where your both coming from. I'd just tell him you want a simple engagement ring, something that's for you and then save the ring for a future child to inherit (if you have children that is).", "I could see if it was passed down to you first but not after it was passed to his first wife!

If the ring has a much smaller rock, and isn't nearly as flashy as the heirloom, will you be okay with that? \n\nHow much money do you want him to spend on the new ring--you haven't mentioned your or his budget, but that's a huge factor. Will you be okay with a ring that costs $1k?

I was engaged for like a week, and my ex fiance bought me a ring that was absolutely nothing like what I wanted.  I actually really don't like diamonds. I think they're super boring. I also don't really like metal rings because i'm allergic to metal.  He got me a gold ring with tiny diamonds all over it.  Regardless of whether I could wear it or not do much due to my allergy, it was the ugliest thing I think I have seen engagement ring wise.\n\nI felt really bad about hating the ring and also super superficial.  We both worked at walmart together, and I ran into him returning the ring a week after I broke up with him.

Because of my hatred for the ring it kinda sank into my brain and made me think terrible things about myself when, in reality, the fact that he chose that ring when i openly talked about my feelings about diamonds and my allergy to metal was a symptom of what was wrong with our relationship.  If he had bought me a wooden ring with a forget me not engraved into it for ten bucks, I would have loved it.  But he didn't because he didn't care about what I actually wanted.\n\nOP, you deserve someone who cares what you want.
