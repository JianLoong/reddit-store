After a few months, I feel reasonably confident in my ability to sign. It all started with a family dinner. Elizabeth looked surprised and happy when I started signing to her. The fact that I had made the time and effort to speak with her in a way that she felt comfortable with truly touched her.Still, not everyone in the family was overly excited about my clandestine project.

Thank you thank you thank you. For existing, for being the person you are. Thank you. You can\u2019t see me but I am literally crying right now. I had to stop and take a moment to even write this comment. Seriously. Thank you.\nThat being said - are you kidding?! How are you even anything close to an asshole in this situation?! You went to the trouble of learning an entire new language, one with few if any actual teachers available, just so you could converse with someone in a way that was comfortable for them. (So many people don\u2019t get that we might be able to hear you (somewhat) and understand you, but it\u2019s still so much easier to write things or sign things. Speaking is uncomfortable since you can\u2019t ask for repeats for everything and often people brush it off, saying it was nothing because they don\u2019t want to repeat themselves and you\u2019re left wondering what it was\u2026) Said someone is not somebody you see and communicate with every day and someone you only see once in a while but you still went to a lot of trouble to help make her feel comfortable and understood.\nHere\u2019s the thing: your brother and husbands cousin could still learn. Start now. They\u2019d have a way to see how a conversation in sign actually goes by watching you and Elizabeth, which is a lot more than the HOH people in my community ever get. The fact that they hadn\u2019t ever thought of learning at all is an indicator of their lack of interest in the first place, though - your brother has the excuse of not knowing Elizabeth, but Hannah has been her cousin for (presumably?) their entire lives. She never learned. That is on her and her alone. But if she\u2019s showing interest now, then good for her. Just don\u2019t let her blame you.\nYou have no actual obligations in this scenario. You could teach them, sure. But think of it like this - if they actually were interested in learning sign and not the fact that you upstaged them, then they would be happy they had someone to help them along, to correct their mistakes and coach them. Instead they\u2019re just upset you left them out. Seems like jealousy to me.\nAnyway - like seriously. THANK YOU FOR BEING AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING. Whoever you are, you deserve all the good things this world has to offer.", "If they want to learn they can spend the time. Enjoy your newfound conversations.

I truly just wanted to create a better connection with Elizabeth, and it warms my heart to know she's happy. I'll work on including Richard and Hannah more in the future, but ultimately, Elizabeth's happiness is what matters most to me.", ">NTA. Not your fault they didn\u2019t have the empathy to put a bit of effort into learning to communicate with a family member.\n\n I'm glad she appreciates the effort. I hope we can all work together to create a more inclusive environment for her in the future.", ">clandestine project\n\nThis makes it sound sinister. You did something awesome and I cannot see why TF your family is upset, unless they feel guilty that they never bothered.\n\nAlso, you sound unconvinced that you actually did nothing wrong. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. You do not need to be apologetic about it.\n\nNTA.", "They\u2019re also adults with a family member who has trouble hearing. They didn\u2019t need someone else to tell them to learn ASL. They just didn\u2019t consider it themselves and now they\u2019re mad that they didn\u2019t get the credit for doing the work to learn. That\u2019s on them.", "I am betting there have been conversations on their end about sign language being \"too hard\" to learn and multiple other excuses.  If they wanted to learn then they cold have but never cared too.  Also, it would have ruined the surprise if they had told Elizabeth.", "They are upset that someone who came into the family put so much effort while they, the family haven't. This isn't on you, it's on them and their insecurities", "NTA, but I have a question. Is Richard also the husband or a different brother?", "can you explain why they're offended in the first place? \n\nI don't udnerstand... is it just cause you made them look bad because they never took the time to learn it or what?", "Nta. \n\nYou are being too silver lining/understanding. \n\nYour brother and your husbands cousin got upset cause you learned sign language to communicate with someone better that had been in your family for years .... in what universe does that make sense? Point out yo them tgat \nA. You dont need their permission to learn a language \nB. You dont need to run ideas for their approval\nC she has been a family member for years and doesnt require you to get permission from them to do things nice for ppl", "NTA.  You wanted to learn sign language so you did.  Now they think they look bad, & are blaming you.  You did nothing wrong.  There was nothing or nobody stopping them from learning, just like you did.  The only people they have to blame is themselves.  Are you supposed to consult them about every decision you make?", "Is Richard the on married to SIL? If so, he is a ginourmous asshole. If not, still an asshole. Why would they put you down if they could have learned it themselves but chose not to? They feel inadequate and rightfully so.", "If that were true, you wouldn\u2019t have been so secretive", "Have you directly invited them to join you?\n\nLanguage learning is challenging, so I can understand how they never got serious about it. They're wrong to blame you, but I can also understand how they might just be inappropriately expressing their disappointment at not being included. But I suppose you could say something like:\n\n\"I'm so sorry you were disappointed I didn't think to invite you to learn sign language with me. I'm excited to be working to communicate with Elizabeth in the language she's most comfortable in, and hadn't thought past just being able to connect with her more deeply. But I value all of you as my family, and if this could be a way for all of us to grow closer, I'd really love that. So far, I've been going through X class and practicing by doing Y online. I'm only a few months in so far, so it's definitely not too late for you to join if that's something you'd like to do. I'm happy to help you catch up so we can all do this together, I'm sure it would be really meaningful for Elizabeth to be able to have whole family conversations in sign. Let me know if that's something you're interested in and we can talk about what kind of schedule would work for everyone.\"\n\nI don't know much about sign, but I like language learning in general (Japanese and German in particular). It's a long journey. A few months can cover a lot of ground, but unless sign is vastly easier to learn than other languages or unless you're a savant, I imagine there's plenty of room for them to catch up and learn together still. If they're pissed because they don't want to learn and don't want you to make them look bad, they're just assholes then of course but nothing wrong with assuming the best and extending an olive branch since it sounds like you'd enjoy the company. Maybe even just knowing that you'd prefer to have their company would be meaningful.", "Don't let their behavior dissuade you. You did good. \ud83d\udc4d", "Noone should be upset by this decision. They aren't entitled to being included in the decision process about what language you speak.", "I just don't understand why they are upset. You learned new language so you could communicate better with your family member. What if she was German speaking and didn't know English and you learned German? It is not different from that.\n\n My sister and my cousin are deaf and in my family we all learned sign language but in my cousin's family they didn't bother to do that. They were so amazed when they saw me signing to my sister and cousin at my father's funeral, it was something special when in reality they were just lazy and didn't care their sister that much.\n\nIf they feel left out when you and Elizabeth were chatting they are just having same experience as Elizabeth all the time. Just ignore their whining, they can learn sign language if they want to.", "Do not help them, they are trying to create discord. It seems you don\u2019t want anyone to be mad at you. This is a them issue, not a you issue. They could\u2019ve easily taken the same initiative you did.", "Richard and Hannah are afraid that you can/will talk about them behind their backs, so to speak. They can see you \"talking\" but have no idea what you're saying. It would be like they're the deaf ones now. Great job OP. NTA.", "They\u2019re upset because it makes them look bad that they haven\u2019t bothered to do it themselves.  Quite frankly, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s any of your cousins business anyway? NTA and good on you for being such a nice individual.", "Don\u2019t live your life worrying about upsetting people over this kind of nonsense.", "Yes I thought that too. It\u2019s them being defensive it sounds like.", "Totally!", "I don\u2019t think you did \u201cexclude\u201d it\u2019s nothing to do with them. It was you learning a language and a nice surprise for your sister in law, and their annoyance/anger is likely them feeling embarrassed they never even thought about the situation. But it\u2019s an immature reaction from them at best! \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to point out situations like that to them. You are not at fault in anyway and if they are saying or implying you are that\u2019s frankly super crappy of them. \n\nIf they care and want to learn (and are adults) the reaction should be \u201cwow, that\u2019s great! I am going to try to do that too!\u201d", "Stop defending yourself. There\u2019s nothing to defend. You did a 100% good thing and these people are jerks.", "Yeah it doesn't make sense to me either. Like why would her brother be upset? He doesn't have any relation to his sister's SIL. She said the husband's cousin which the only thing I can think their is that they felt they looked bad for not learning it.", "I don\u2019t even divulge my plans in case I change my mind or fail etc lol you owe them no explanations, but it\u2019s nice that you want to include them", "NTA and big respect from me .", "THIS!! They are mad you thought of it first.", "I was also wondering about Richard...", "She didn't make them look bad. They made themselves look bad.", "Yea she\u2019s way too nice and naive sounding", ">Noone should be upset by this decision.\n\nWho is this \"Noone\" person?", "They feel upset cause they think OP did this to upstage them.\n\nIf they actually had an interest in sign language, they would either have started already or asked OP for help with lessons now that they know OP learned the skill. But they don't actually want to learn. But they didn't want OP to a shine a light on their disinterest in learning.", "He\u2019s the one who sings \u201cI\u2019m Henry the 8th I Am\u201d."]}
