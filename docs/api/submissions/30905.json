After a few months, I feel reasonably confident in my ability to sign. It all started with a family dinner. Elizabeth looked surprised and happy when I started signing to her. The fact that I had made the time and effort to speak with her in a way that she felt comfortable with truly touched her.Still, not everyone in the family was overly excited about my clandestine project.

If they wanted to learn to sign, then they should take courses themselves. It is not up to you, the sister in law, to push them into any activity.

Thank you thank you thank you. For existing, for being the person you are. Thank you. You can\u2019t see me but I am literally crying right now. I had to stop and take a moment to even write this comment. Seriously. Thank you.\nThat being said - are you kidding?! How are you even anything close to an asshole in this situation?! You went to the trouble of learning an entire new language, one with few if any actual teachers available, just so you could converse with someone in a way that was comfortable for them. (So many people don\u2019t get that we might be able to hear you (somewhat) and understand you, but it\u2019s still so much easier to write things or sign things. Speaking is uncomfortable since you can\u2019t ask for repeats for everything and often people brush it off, saying it was nothing because they don\u2019t want to repeat themselves and you\u2019re left wondering what it was\u2026) Said someone is not somebody you see and communicate with every day and someone you only see once in a while but you still went to a lot of trouble to help make her feel comfortable and understood.\nHere\u2019s the thing: your brother and husbands cousin could still learn. Start now. They\u2019d have a way to see how a conversation in sign actually goes by watching you and Elizabeth, which is a lot more than the HOH people in my community ever get. The fact that they hadn\u2019t ever thought of learning at all is an indicator of their lack of interest in the first place, though - your brother has the excuse of not knowing Elizabeth, but Hannah has been her cousin for (presumably?) their entire lives. She never learned. That is on her and her alone. But if she\u2019s showing interest now, then good for her. Just don\u2019t let her blame you.\nYou have no actual obligations in this scenario. You could teach them, sure. But think of it like this - if they actually were interested in learning sign and not the fact that you upstaged them, then they would be happy they had someone to help them along, to correct their mistakes and coach them. Instead they\u2019re just upset you left them out. Seems like jealousy to me.\nAnyway - like seriously. THANK YOU FOR BEING AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING. Whoever you are, you deserve all the good things this world has to offer.", "If they want to learn they can spend the time. Enjoy your newfound conversations.

I'm more than happy to help Richard and Hannah learn sign language too, so we can all better connect with Elizabeth together.", "I bet OP's decision to learn left them feeling guilty, and now they're trying to make it seem like OP is the one at fault.

But who in the world are Richard and Hannah and why are they sooooo concerned. If they want to learn to sign they can nothing is stopping them. They're just mad they didn't think to do it first but I can't figure out is why or why no one in this family thought to learn any sign language before you join3d assuming you joined after the sil.", "NTA I think they're annoyed because you doing this has made them look bad because they haven't done this.", "NTA. You did a very thoughtful thing! I\u2019m sorry your family is trying to make you feel bad. They are probably thinking you are showing them up so to speak and are taking it out on you. But you have done nothing wrong, and it sounds like it made Elizabeth feel included.", "[removed]", "Op they are just mad because someone (you) put in the effort when they don\u2019t want to or can not.  (I truly would have a hard time learning sign language,  I\u2019ve had years of studying for French and Japanese and still I am horrible at them).\n\nThe fact you did it on your own, both in the decision too and the learning how to without someone else nudging you too, when these two who have been part of her family for years have not really shows how little they care, and makes them look bad.", "This is kind of confusing.\n\nYou would love for them to learn with you\n\nBut you kept it secret to pull it out at family dinner like a party trick?", "You sound really kind. I\u2019m glad Elizabeth has you, and I hope you continue to have great conversations and learn more about each other(and that Richard and Hannah come around too)!", "WHY are they policing what you do ? They sound controlling ...", "They're probably also upset to be EXCLUDED from any and all conversation between OP and Hannah.  \n\nI don't know about anyone else but there are quite a few 'busybodies' in my family whose noses would be SEVERELY out of joint if left out of any conversation.", "*slams fist on desk*\n\nWe need a MS Paint family tree diagram!!!", "NTA. To communicate with someone else in the family. How hard is it to learn 200-300 words that are pretty common to talk to a family member? They are embarrassingly lazy!", "Well if it\u2019s French, impossible!  I speak 2 languages fluently and 2 enough to travel.  I started taking French as my then 4th language at 13 and again in college.  Nope, does not stick at all.  I took 4 years of Spanish no problem but French I got pity grades for trying hard \ud83d\ude02. I grew up exposed to French so I was very confused."]}
