We're often busy around the morning time, sometimes getting rushes that last from 8am to 10am. There's this woman who will call the store once to twice a week, usually while we're busy to try and place an order for pickup over the phone. I've tried telling her multiple times that we don't take mobile orders over the phone, you can place an order for delivery or pick-up with Uber eats, doordash, GrubHub, and even our mobile app. She refuses to use any of these services then demands we get her order ready. The last time my coworker accepted her order, and it took her half an hour to arrive. Her food was cold, her drinks melting, then had the audacity to complain. \n\nToday she called, I said no and explained she can use our mobile app to place an order. She refused this answer and after a few minutes of back and forth I hung up on her, we had customers waiting. She called again and this repeated, except now she yells at me that all my other coworkers accept her order, that she's been doing this for years, that she'll file a complaint... Again I tell her no and hang up.\n\n She comes to the store, berates me for almost 15 minutes refusing to move from in front of the counter, I literally have to serve guests around her. I explain to her over and over that we don't do that, it's a policy within my workplace. I break for a moment and call her entitled, that I'm not fulfilling her special needs and providing her a service we don't provide for other customers. After wasting 15 minutes of both of our lives, I take her order she gets her shit, and she's gone... for now. \n\n(Btw, her disability requires her to use a cane to walk. But she was somehow completely fine standing in place for 15 minutes to yell at me while holding up a line of people.) \n\n\nTldr; I refused to take her order over the phone, it's a service we don't provide as it's against policy.\n\nEdit: People are calling me the asshole for dishing out a bit of hate against her at the end. For that I apologize, I felt the need to include it because she was acting incredibly entitled and I feel that was her reason. It is true I know nothing of her disability. But I also have customers come in with walkers, canes, breathing equipment, and none of them have had the attitude of needing to be treated specially.", "created_utc": 1692989422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1617oza/aita_for_refusing_to_meet_a_disabled_customers/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They may not even be set-up to do as some card readers require an attempted card swipe or chip read before allowing hand key.  That or she may not be willing to prepay resulting in the requirement to suspend the order which may require a manager who may or may not actually be available.

Tying up the staff to be answering phones is a logistical nightmare. It\u2019s why we invented mobile ordering. \n\nIf they\u2019re regularly busy, they aren\u2019t losing valuable customers.

No, just the service we don\u2019t offer? Ok, have a nice day then.\u201d And hang up.

Next time, call the police and have her removed. No need to let her abuse you.", "Nts you don't provide the service. Your coworkers can do what they want for the last however you are not obligated to.", "NTA. People can be disabled and people can be abusive assholes and people can be both - none of it is related. Talk to your boss- they need to inform her either that she's banned from attempting phone orders or that she's banned entirely. Then they need to educate ALL the staff on how to handle her next call- and there WILL be many future calls- so that she receives consistent treatment.\n\n\nIf I were your boss I would call her once to let her know that he doesn't accept customers who berate the staff, block her phone number and post st a note  in the back so staff know to consistently decline to serve her. Your boas also needs to be ready to call the police to trespass her if she shows up.\n\nIf your boss won't step up and back you up, start looking for a new job- this one isn't worth it", "NTA. Glad you dished a bit, disabilities are no excuse to behave like an entitled jerk.", "NTA\n\nI don't see how her using a cane is even remotely relevant. In fact, it would be better for her to use the mobile ordering apps and have it delivered in that case, as opposed to ordering over the phone and then physically coming in to pick it up. Moreover, the fact that you don't do over the phone orders has nothing to do with her being disabled because you DO provide other alternatives to coming in and standing in line. She is choosing not to use those options.\n\nHere's my advice though, what I've learned from dealing with customers like that who like to waste your time. Do NOT engage any of their arguments. It is not worth it trying to deal with entitled stupid. Simply repeat yourself and provide options like you're talking to a toddler.\n\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, we don't offer that service. Is there something else I can help you with?\"\n\nAnd when she inevitably does not provide you with something reasonable you CAN help her with and just repeats her demands, literally just repeat that line. 90% of the time she will realize she's getting no where and will hang up on her own.\n\nAnd talk to your boss about this one to make sure it's okay (ie: make sure your boss is reasonable and not one of those \"the customer is always right\" types), but if she does not give up after being told multiple times you cannot help her, you can escalate to, \"As I said, we do not provide that service. As it seems there is nothing I can help you with I'll be ending the call now. Have a good day.\" And then hang up.\n\nIf she's in the store you replace \"I'll be hanging up\" with \"I'll have to ask you to leave as you are causing a disturbance for the other customers,\" which escalates to \"If you do not leave I will have to call the police.\" And you are not bluffing. If she does not leave, call the police. Keeping her business is not worth the damage it does to your other customer's experiences.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA, back in my service days I would have called the cops.", "Yea this is bizarre to me too. Sure, you can make reservations over the phone for a cafe or bistro, but to openly flout the multiple delivery methods in place is some strong main character mentality. NTA", "I'd block the number", "This.  If even *one* person does it even *one* time, then the customer goes, \"Aha, so you CAN do it!  You're too just lazy to help and don't care about me!\" and then it's twice as bad.  There's no concept of them having gotten a special one-time favor.", "Just because something has always been done does not mean it should continue. My 96 year old grandmother knows how to use DoorDash. A talking parrot could figure it out. She is \u201ctechnologically challenged\u201d by choice.", "Fucking relieved someone else has said this."]}
