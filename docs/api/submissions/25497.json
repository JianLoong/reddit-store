In fact, it would be better for her to use the mobile ordering apps and have it delivered in that case, as opposed to ordering over the phone and then physically coming in to pick it up. Moreover, the fact that you don't do over the phone orders has nothing to do with her being disabled because you DO provide other alternatives to coming in and standing in line. She is choosing not to use those options.\n\nHere's my advice though, what I've learned from dealing with customers like that who like to waste your time. Do NOT engage any of their arguments. It is not worth it trying to deal with entitled stupid. Simply repeat yourself and provide options like you're talking to a toddler.\n\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, we don't offer that service. Is there something else I can help you with?\"\n\nAnd when she inevitably does not provide you with something reasonable you CAN help her with and just repeats her demands, literally just repeat that line. 90% of the time she will realize she's getting no where and will hang up on her own.\n\nAnd talk to your boss about this one to make sure it's okay (ie: make sure your boss is reasonable and not one of those \"the customer is always right\" types), but if she does not give up after being told multiple times you cannot help her, you can escalate to, \"As I said, we do not provide that service. As it seems there is nothing I can help you with I'll be ending the call now. Have a good day.\" And then hang up.\n\nIf she's in the store you replace \"I'll be hanging up\" with \"I'll have to ask you to leave as you are causing a disturbance for the other customers,\" which escalates to \"If you do not leave I will have to call the police.\" And you are not bluffing. If she does not leave, call the police. Keeping her business is not worth the damage it does to your other customer's experiences.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA, back in my service days I would have called the cops.", "Yea this is bizarre to me too. Sure, you can make reservations over the phone for a cafe or bistro, but to openly flout the multiple delivery methods in place is some strong main character mentality.

I don\u2019t know the nature of the disability, but some people have brain injury related disability and cannot do online forms/apps. The phone is literally the only option for some people.\n\nEDIT: I have never heard of a coffee shop in a gas station  that takes advanced orders. But I guess it\u2019s only possible in person or through an app?
