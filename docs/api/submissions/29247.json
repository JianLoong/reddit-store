She's wanting to get married in Paris, and expects all guests to pay for their own flights and hotels. This isn't a problem, but I only just found out that my partner (25F) would not be invited.\n\nI live with my partner and my sister has met her and they seem to get on. We don't live super close so they haven't met often but I didn't think that was an issue. \n\nMy sisters reasoning is that it's a small wedding (which is true), and that only people shes close to will be invited, however she's also stated that she'd rather invite her friends than my partner. I thought this was disrespectful since, 1, I live with my partner so it's not like we're not serious, and 2, we'd had multiple conversations with my sister where we discussed the logistics of both me and my partner attending the wedding and she never corrected us. My sister also argued that its costing her a lot of money to get married, but she wouldn't be having a meal at the actual wedding and as I mentioned previously we would be paying for ourselves to fly out and stay.\n\nI don't think this is a homophobic thing, but I feel that if she doesn't respect my relationship enough to extend an invite to my partner then I don't want to spend hundreds to go to her wedding. I feel like i may be the asshole because she is my only sibling and it is her wedding after all. So AITA?\n\nEDIT\n \nThere's no cap on the number of guests. Other peoples partners have been invited and my sister has said my partner is not welcome at all regardless if she attends the wedding\n\nEDIT 2\n\nThank you for all the comments, I will address a couple things.\n\nFirst of all neither me nor my partner want to go to Paris, we don't like it, we don't want to explore after the wedding.\n\nSecond, we really don't believe this is a homophobic thing (more likely a we aren't married thing), she's never given the slightest indication of disproving before.", "created_utc": 1697726459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bkrgt/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you do decide to go, your partner can also go to Paris. She just wouldn't go to the ceremony.

Does she really think all her friends are going to pony up that much money and she is being cheap on top of it (no food). That is an awful long trip and lots of money to see someone get married with nothing to do afterwards except maybe sightsee with your partner.", "NTA.  To me, I wouldn't mind paying for even a new significant other of a best friend or sibling.  I'd want them to come because I'd want the person I'm close to invited to feel comfortable and have more fun, and I'd want their signicant other to feel closer to us and like they matter too.

It's bizarre that she allowed you to think your partner was invited and then pulled the rug. I think you're NTA for deciding not to go.

To me, the question is : is that only a rule for your partner, or is that happening with other partners/spouses ? Are other guests (regardless of how official the relationship is) expected to travel alone ?", "NTA.  It's a Destination Wedding.   Anyone who is willing to shell out the money to go should be welcomed", "NTA. Nobody is obligated to attend any wedding beyond the couple, a witness, and the officiant.  You are invited, you aren't obligated.  The only reason you need is that you don't want to.  I agree, if your sister doesn't respect you, your partner, or your relationship enough to invite your partner, then why would you even want to go?", "NTA. It is her wedding, but not inviting the partner of your only sibling is definitely flashing some alarms. Especially if she is not paying for the travel or hotel and it is a destination wedding (obviously she is not having a meal at the wedding either?). \n\nYou might as well take the money that you would have put for the trip and go on a solo romantic getaway to Paris when she is getting married (that is if you want to antagonize her a bit more, which I don't think you do). Alternative is simply stating \"This is my partner, we are living and sharing our life together. If you have problem with that, I wish you wonderful wedding, but I will skip the travel without -my- partner to go and see you get married to yours.\"", "NTA.

I wouldn\u2019t waste my money on a trip to Paris if my partner couldn\u2019t come. I\u2019d rather the two of us see the city together.

Everyone else's is so enjoy your wedding but I and my partner will just go on a romantic trip on our own. \n\n\nLeave it at that. If any family says you need to go, suck it up, or support her, tell them this. \n\nWell, since your family, spouse, partner are invited. Since you are not being singled out as the only one not allowed to bring their partner. Guess you are seen as family. But I refuse to accept such disrespect or brush it under the rug. I am not the bigger person, I am not the doormat, nor am I one to accept such from so-called family.

Even if your partner was invited, that just makes it even more of a burden just to attend a wedding. You're not an asshole for not attending for any reason.\n\nWhy does it bother you, though? I mean, why do you *need* your partner there? Or is it the principle of the matter (which is valid)? What's keeping you from bringing your partner and turning it into a vacation for the two of you?

I mean this goes down to the basics, main table at a reception being closest family and usually the further distant the relation or friend the further you'll be from teh head table. \n\nOccam's razor here is that OPs partner is being excluded deliberately and the most obvious difference is sexual orientation.", "Thanks, I didn't have time to write it out.", "If I was in a serious relationship with my partner and a very close family member invited me but not my partner, despite other partners being invited, I would tell them to fuck right off. \n\nI responded to a similar post some time ago and was excoriated, people asking if I was joined at the hip with my partner, if I could go to the toilet on my own etc. However, this shows a fundamental lack of respect for the seriousness of my relationship and my loyalty is to my partner.\n\nIf the bride was a work colleague or fourteenth cousin twice removed and who had not met my partner, well, that might be different. But this is your sister and your partner knows now, and will forever know, that your sister does not value your partner as being part of her family in any way shape or form. If you attended this wedding, you would be showing solidarity with a sibling who regards your partner as next to worthless.\n\nNTA and well done for having the spine to tell your sister you aren't going. \n\nYou are however, TA for not liking Paris (August is best as there are fewer Parisians) /s and I would reassess your insistence that this has nothing to do with your sister, or her fianc\u00e9, being ashamed that you are gay, unless, of course, there are other gay guests at the wedding.\n\nPlease post again when you and your partner are getting married, telling us how pissed off your sister is that she is not invited to your wedding.", "How are you both 24?
