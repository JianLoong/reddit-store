But when news of my home purchase circulated, he became very sour.\n\nIt began with what seemed like jokes about how I must have struck an amazing deal to have been able to afford it. However, things turned less light hearted and he began calling me \"poor boy\" and making a concerted effort to publicly portray me as financially destitute. Even when someone brought cookies to the office, and he loudly remarked about the \"poor boy\" rushing for free food.

Having known this to begin with, I wonder if my response went too far, akin to kicking a man when he\u2019s down.

I know his background and that he is supporting his son (and grandson) on one income who is struggling with drugs and is unable to hold down a job. I knew full well that this is the reason behind him belittling me at work and trying to make out as if I was in a worse financial position than I am.\n\nInstead of acting in an understanding way, I deliberately exaggerated my budget for renovating my bathroom knowing that, due to his background and insecurity, this would upset him more. I did it to \u201cget back\u201d at him for his previous comments and remove his ability to continue to publicly make out as if I am destitute.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's being a jerk with his jealousy of your achievements and probably compares his don to you. \n\nYou've done nothing wrong", "IMO you should flaunt more, flex more, but never a snide remark or bitterness shown. In fact, buy him stuff, like cheap chocolate (girly stuff) or offer to pay for his lunch especially when there are witnesses. Be nice about it, but keep a distance still. \n\nBeing his friend will mean getting sucked into his pathetic life story, which is an emotional trap, and if you are ensnared, you will have lost. Also, explain this to your colleagues who might notice. Tell them how you feel. Don't give this man a weapon to use against you in the form of commiserating colleagues.\n\nHe does not deserve kindness. Trust me, I have met plenty of this specimen. Because as soon as you lower your guards down, they will pounce.", "You're NTA. It's not your fault he's so jealous. Considering his constant snide remarks, he had it coming to him.", "NTA.

In fact, I only mentioned it to one other person in the office. \n\nThe reason that I mentioned I am young is due to it\u2019s relevance as it pertains to my colleagues background. His son is about double my age and hasn\u2019t moved out of home yet which I think is the core reason why he is acting the way he is towards me.", "He mentioned his \"young age\" because it's relevant to this older man feeling competitive with him. And OP doesn\u2019t need to explain whether he had help to purchase the house because it is completely irrelevant to the situation. His colleague doesn't know those details and they didn't come up. It honestly sounds like you're bitter like the colleague about his success in life.\n\nAs a 33yo who recently started getting career success and just bought my first home, I get it. It can be hard to see 20yo's breaking into the market with mum and dad's help when they never had to work for it. But that's how life goes. You can't blame somebody for taking help that's handed to them. We'd take it too and do it for our own kids if we could. \n\nOP, you're NTA. He's a full grown adult. If he's going to go around starting shit, he can't be surprised when someone gives it back. People like this just keep going until someone shuts them down. Next time maybe he'll think twice before being petty, mean and unprofessional. But be careful with creating tension at work. Perhaps follow it up by telling him directly that you want to put your issues aside and he needs to stop taking jabs at you and trying to publicly shame you in front of colleagues. You can apologise for 'any upset you caused' if you think it'll help soothe his ego while being told off, but don't take too much blame. Someone like him will play the victim and use your own words against you.", "I didn\u2019t share it widely though. In fact, I only told one colleague who I am close with.

They ask how you're doing, what's going on, what you did on the weekend. Why shouldn't you share and be happy about exciting news? There's a real difference between that and rubbing it in. Should he also keep it secret if he gets married, has a child, goes on vacation? Just be closed off and rude to the people you spend your days with in case one is irrationally jealous and bitter? Seems weird.", "Best not to as HR may get involved. Also, saying you bought a house/car/etc is fine. Don't ever bring up salary though and numbers is pushing it (even if they're fake). \n\nThe guy is an asshole and tries to push off some of his misery on you. \n\nIt sounds like you're doing well. Don't let his words bother you.\n\nI haven't worked in a toxic environment for a long time, but it sure brings back memories.\n\nJust ignore him as you've been doing. Others know he's a loser.", "I see. I was under the impression of you telling everyone. I do not say that you should keep your joy to yourself, but you do not have to be vengeful either. You might probably have a closer look at your friend and ask her not to gossip and try to make up with the guy by saying that you were overjoyed and a bit oversharing. If he does not feel sorry for his behavior, so be it. Just remember that some people might rake your words personally and twist them around and take care."]}
