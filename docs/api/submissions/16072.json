You were *at home* when Charlotte arrived home and could have very easily unlocked the door for her so she could get inside of your shared home.

You wanted to teach her, the person you are supposed to care about and love (at least I assume you do since you've been in a relationship with her for three fucking years), a lesson by making her *checks notes* piss herself?

You knew she struggled with bladder control and you intentionally locked her out of her own home. Therefore you likely knew this could happen. She's your girlfriend, not your kid.

You're right, she should remember her key, but you should have a little compassion. Perhaps suggest that she keep her house key on the ring with her other keys. I fail to see how you can't be bothered to open the damn door for her though. The reason why is irrelevant; when someone needs to be let in, it's common courtesy to open the door for them.

And would rather teach her some messed up lesson than walk to the door.", "Home Assistant master race", "Oh ho ho! I didn\u2019t even think of that! OP is a stinker of a bf.", "The ONLY way an age gap is okay, is if you can  flip it for the younger person, and it would still be deemed appropriate/acceptable.\n\nFor example, in this situation where he\u2019s 29 and she\u2019s 22, that\u2019s a 7 year age gap. If it was flipped, she would be dating a 15yo. That\u2019s wildly inappropriate by itself, but it gets even worse when you factor in that at the start of their relationship, if the age gap was flipped, that means *she would be dating a 12 year old.*", "Yeah there's definitely degrees of it, but I've found, even in reasonable age gaps of 2 or 3 years, it is very often the older that's the asshole. Not always, but it's an easy shorthand for this sub.", "Also true, just tends to be the man that's older.", "I am soooo surprised the 26 yo dude who started \"dating\" a young 19 yo woman and claims their age gap isn't relevant here turns out to be an inconsiderate borderline abusive asshole to her. What a coincidence, yk. Sure showed us it's not relevant.", "That's always the reason why men date younger women", "The age gap here is no red flag. There's 8 years between my parents and 5 between me and the mother to my children.\n\nHalf your age, add 7 (from 18 on). 15(14.5)+7 = 22.", "And what you're saying is fucking bizarre considering the issue ilat hand is a man intentionally causing his partner to wet himself in some fucked up way to teach her a lesson. \n\nAnd yes, he made her wet herself. At that point the key was already forgotten and it was on him to let her in.", ">if you have that issue make sure you bring your key\n\nIt's almost, ALMOST, as if the very *principle* of forgetting is that you forget and can't help it and just \"make sure\". Maybe you should check the definition or something.", "He did not say that anywhere.", ">He said she has diabetes and doesn\u2019t always take her insulin.\r  \n\r\n\nNo, he did not.\n\nHe ASSUMES it is because of high sugar (so I take it he thinks she is diabetic type 2?) While that might be the cause, there are numerous other reasons (both physical as mental/psychological ) that can cause (some form of) bladder incontinence. So he shouldn't just assume, but talk with the GF and take her for a doctor's appointment.\n\nStatistical speaking (according to the medical poster in my GP's / doctor's waiting room) 1 in 4 women will be confronted with (temporal) bladder incontinence, for men it is 1 in 3. \n\nLook, and whatever the cause of her (hopefully temporally) bladder incontinence, OP is an AH for ignoring her while she clearly asked for help to let her in.", "Then you're stupid and the A..", "So, for both of her birthdays, her and her family lied to you about her age?", "I always thank mine too, lol, just in case...", "Not borderline. Leaving someone outside to piss themselves IS abuse. It is humiliation at it's finest and OP deserves to die alone.", "Oh the age gap isn't the issue. The OP being TA is. He's 29 going on 19 by the sound.", "When you\u2019re 26 going after a 19 year old, it\u2019s a red flag. This isn\u2019t a guy who\u2019s 39 going after a 32 year old.", "It could very easily be a UTI.", "Not just that, but making her wet herself *to teach her some arbitrary lesson*. \n\nPeople forget keys. It happens. She happens to forget them often, but some people have problems with memory. Mine has been slipping as of late and I forget really silly things if I don't set a reminder for it or write a note\n\nAnd to top it off, he has to phrase the question as if he *didn't* make her pee herself. Which he totally did", "Dude let's stop pretending age gaps, especially when it's about teens and young adults, aren't an issue. They're frowned upon *because* the older person seeks younger people specifically *to* treat them like shit.\n\nEdit : plus even if they don't, there are still power dynamics that just shouldn't be there in a couple.", "They've been dating for 3 years. She was 19, he was 26. That's an issue.", "That's assuming the 29 year old is fully mature and responsible. Reading OP, this clearly is not the case. They are mentally immature and probably felt the need to seek a younger companion because a mature woman would see right through them.\n\nOP would be an Ahole regardless of age of partner. They rather play games than, I dunno, meet them from work.", "It's her fault for peeing her pants when she has a medical condition? Really? Are you fucking serious? Also, are you telling me that you've never forgotten your key at home? Maybe, next time you get locked out, you should be left outside to freeze overnight. It'll teach you some responsibility.", "Poor of me to assume yes, I apologize, but if he happens to be from the US, he knows exactly what I mean by her not being legally old enough to drink being a problem considering he\u2019s almost old enough to be in the US Senate. Ages for consumption were put in place differently in America for a reason and I assume that reason is that Americans can\u2019t seem to handle alcohol before the age of 21 responsibly (and sometimes even after 21) other countries probably have young adults that take drinking more seriously, but (some) Americans do not which is why the law is 21.", "She told him she was \"22\" but she was actually 19 at the time. \n\nOther person was questioning how he could be oblivious for 2 years when she couldn't legally drink them and there might've been situations where that would've come up (going out/ordering drinks).", "Also ... im not sure if he means plant nursery or child nursery, but she is working full time and getting extra qualifications (i.e., some form of lessons or study) on top of it.  She's busy and pribably distracted, which makes her forget little things.  So, I've been helpful and made \"Charlotte\" a list\n\n\nCharlitte's to do list \n\n 1.  Make a Doctor's appointment re urinary urgency and frequency.\n\n2. Get a key lanyard for around your necK.\n\n3. In the words of Dan Savage, DTMFA.  (Google it),  he's petty, abusive ans selfish.  None will get better.", "YTA, I have adhd and bipolar 1 disorder so I\u2019m very spacey and forget things. This guy is definitely a grade A asshole", "That's a wild assumption. Men are generally less mentally mature than women, and this post is yet another slice of evidence to support this.\n\nedit: Should add, OP would probably be TA regardless of age of partner", "Actually no, outside of being a teenager, I haven't.  At most 2 times left my keys at work. \n\n\nFunny enough it's because at 13 I left my keys at home and peed my pants in the hall because no one was home......true story. Never forgot my keys again", "18 is legal drinking age in a very large part of the world, that's what they mean.\nNot that it matters. The AH vibes coming from OP are staggering.", "She could legally drink in most places in the world.", "Not everyone drinks, she very well could've lied and said she doesn't drink. (Or not even lie, many people have tried alcohol way before 21. I know I won't be drinking it anytime soon and in still a good 2 years from 21)", "Not an assumption, just... Actually observed in most of those relationships?\n\nPlus I never mentioned gender. You're the one bringing up men, further confirming that this phenomenon is indeed observed and common lol\n\nAn immature 29 yo still has the upper hand on a mature 19 yo and that's why it's still problematic.", "Wow, good for you for not having any problems with your memory and being neurotypical, allowing you to not forget important things on a daily basis. Also good for you for not having any health conditions that make you susceptible to bladder leaks/urinary incontinence. \n\nI know this must be a foreign concept to you, but just because YOU don\u2019t have any medical conditions that prevent you from accomplishing those things, doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else has that same privilege.", "Yes you're right! Lol, I totally read their comment wrong and thought they were confused about her age, but it was me that made a mistake!", "Very true, and also I misread their comment! I thought they misunderstood the age thing, but it was me who read wrong!", "That's your particular view point from what (limited) data you have available. Here in the UK, 8 years age gap was common between Husband and Wife.\n\nAnd you are right on one thing, I made assumption OP is male, as their attitude is pretty spit to that of a typical, teenage male.\n\nAnd I have to disagree. I'm closer to 50 than 20, and mentally, I haven't progressed past 24. But, I have neurodiversity assisting that.", "I do that all the time:)"]}
