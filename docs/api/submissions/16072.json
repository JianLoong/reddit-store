A man as old as you acting like this is just embarrassing. You know she has a medical condition that causes her to need to use the bathroom as quick as possible when she has to go, and yet you ignore her request to use the bathroom and put your phone on do not disturb?

Incontinence at her age and without an obvious cause is worrying.", "YTA. \n\nI don't get your logic at all.

You were *at home* when Charlotte arrived home and could have very easily unlocked the door for her so she could get inside of your shared home.

You wanted to teach her, the person you are supposed to care about and love (at least I assume you do since you've been in a relationship with her for three fucking years), a lesson by making her *checks notes* piss herself?

You knew she struggled with bladder control and you intentionally locked her out of her own home. Therefore you likely knew this could happen. She's your girlfriend, not your kid. You need to communicate with her on an equal level. Not try to teach her a lesson.

You're right, she should remember her key, but you should have a little compassion. Perhaps suggest that she keep her house key on the ring with her other keys. I fail to see how you can't be bothered to open the damn door for her though. The reason why is irrelevant; when someone needs to be let in, it's common courtesy to open the door for them.

It seems like she had to go after she missed her bus to get home", "As someone with bladder issues dealing with urgency, I can assure you that it is possible to go before leaving a place and not even 15 minutes later be close to wetting yourself again.", "If someone has urge incontinence they cannot help but to pee when their bladder sends that signal.   \nWithout knowing the reasons behind her wetting herself, nobody can say if she can actually help it in any way.", "So I know someone with bladder problems.

Yes, it's a very dangerous situation!", "Then YTA, why would you intentionally lock her out instead of communicating that it\u2019s frustrating to you.

Ick, no wonder you went for a teenager", "ESH This needs to be added to the post.", "Yeah, 29 and 22 was a red flag from the get go. What\u2019s crazy is she seems more mature than him", "So as an adult who have this problem, don't you think she should be a little responsible to make sure she has a key to the place she lives. \n\nOp is a jerk.  I just disagreed with the whole \"you made her wet herself\".", "Do you make sure you bring your key with you when you leave your home?\n\nYup OP an ass.

But she's irresponsible and need to start bringing her key.  We can agree on that right", "How by reading that comment is saying she's an AH. \n\nShe's not, I'm just saying it's partially her fault for peeing her pants.

And that if she had her key she wouldn't have peed herself. \n\nIs any of that wrong?"]}
