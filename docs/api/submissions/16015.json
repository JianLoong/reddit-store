I still live with my parents, my older sister, Jo, (25f), and younger two sisters (Alisha 17f, Rowan 2f). My 2 year old sister is a terror. Anything she can break at the moment, she will. My parents are working really hard at teaching her that's wrong, but they've also expressed to me and my sisters that its our responsibility to keep stuff we can't have/don't want broken away from her and out of her reach, our things are our responsibility. \n\nSomething I've been fairly vigilant about keeping away from Rowan was the infant bath. Rowan liked to use it as a \"jumper\", couldn't figure out why it was wrong. I stored it in my wardrobe when it wasnt in use, except for when it was drying post-bath time. \n\nYesterday, Rowan managed to get at it, and managed to tear the sticking between the mesh and the fabric. It was cheap enough but due to the fact my car deciding to play dead a week earlier and cost me an arm and a leg, I haven't been able to buy a new one for another two weeks. \n\nMy parents won't replace it because it was something that was my responsibility. They have replaced things worth a lot of money that she's broken, but are putting their foot down with this. \n\nMy baby had a blowout today, in the hair kinda job, she obviously needed a bath, and I remember my parents bathing Rowan, also covered in poop, in the kitchen sink when she was a newborn. There's pictures of me and newborn Alisha in the sink together. So it's clearly something they were alright with at some point. \n\nI was bathing her when Jo came in and started giving out that it was disgusting and unhygienic to bathe baby in the sink, but I pointed out that our parents did it with us, and she said it's different because our parents were raising their first kid in different times and were stuck in their ways by the last. I said I didn't feel comfortable putting her in the bath without a seat and I was especially uncomfortable with taking her into the shower with me.\n\nMy mom got involved and my sister said her point, and mom said my sisters opinion should matter here, my dad thinks I wasn't in the wrong, and asked did they expect me to take the baby into the garden and give her a blast with the hose or something. It doesn't matter much, but alisha also agrees with me here, because again, baby needs a bath.\n\nJo is still harping on and my mom is defending her.

Baby bathtubs are great but sinks serve the same purpose.", "Tell Jo to get over it and move on. The baby needed a bath, it's done. It's actually dangerous just to take a baby into a shower, you could slip and drop the baby. The full size bath probably would have been ok but if you're not confident then sink is fine. My dad used to have his bath in the sink. As far as hygiene. The Japanese separate their bathing cos why would you want to have a bath near a toilet where there is faecal matter. I don't really get the hygiene comment, you're washing the baby with soap and water so it seems appropriate. I mean people wash food in a sink and wash clothes in a sink. As long as you wipe other surfaces the baby might have touched.", "NTA. Sink bathing is so normal. And safe! My midwife recommended it, even. \n\nYou're doing good with a really difficult spot. Good luck.", " NTA. The sink can be cleaned.

Lots of people do this.", "NTA \n\nYou do what you have to do.\n\nBoth of my boys were to big for most infant bathtubs.   I used to roll a towel up to place under their heads/necks and put just a little bit of water in the tub.  Yes, I ended up with a sopping wet towel,  but it works for us and other babies in the family.  It might work for you, and save a bit of money that could go towards other needs.", "NTA.  We actually had a mesh lounger thing when mine were tiny that went in the sink for that very reason.", " NTA.  One of my fondest childhood memories is being bathed in the big porcelain kitchen sink. I could watch the older kids playing in the yard. The spray hose was gentle and warm on my head, and I almost never got soap in my eyes.  I was very disappointed when I outgrew the sink.\n\nAnd your parents are TA for not replacing your baby's  tub. Their child destroyed it. They should replace it. Offloading responsibility to the victim is a dangerous strategy.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a tough spot, and so are your family members. Sounds like you\u2019re doing your best.

If they don't want you to wash the baby in the sink, they need to replace the bath you bought specifically for that purpose that their child broke. Your parents are far and away the AH for that.

I had four kids and had a baby bathtub and they still got a bath in the damn kitchen sink; poop and all!! What is wrong with people thinking that with all these now founded gadgets that you can\u2019t bathe your kids the old fashioned way?!! Hide your boobs when you breastfeed due to making others uncomfortable? Two words: FUCK THAT! What do you think was used a a bottle in the old days? A damn tit!

Use fucking bleach! Tell everyone to chill and gift them a bottle of Clorox!", "NTA. Your parents did the same with you. I would talk with them and say that is why you thought it was OK.

Sounds like you are disinfectanting the sink properly. It's not much different than kitchen utensils used for raw food preparation! That being said, have you ever heard of a Blooming Bath Flower??? These are flower shaped baby bath mats that fit most sized sinks to help cushion the babies while bathing. The best part is they are very quick to clean up, just wring them out and then air dry. You can also wash them in the washing machine; great for when blowouts happen! I personally always recommend these to new moms, and I believe them to be quite popular.

If you want to keep the peace clean her with wipes then take a shallow bath with her. I used to relish the downtime when baby and I could chill in the tub for a bit.

I just thought you put small babies in the sink and bigger ones had to go in the bath and if you didn't have a bath you just didn't wash your toddler \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If they can't keep a 2 year old from breaking things how are you supposed to keep a 5 week old from shitting?\n\nAlso, your sister is a full ass adult. If she can't handle what's going on at your parents house, she can go elsewhere", "I've bathed both my kids in the kitchen sink. It's not a big deal and your sister and mom need to either stfu or get you a new baby bath. NTA", "My exact thoughts, isn't this the way it's done ?? My mom did it with me, I've seen family members do it with their babies.", "Maybe the parents should look into some forms of birth control", "Or, since she\u2019s 25, to move out.", "I think it gets tricky. While I as a parent would offer to replace something my child broke, I don't think its necessary when it's due to negligence on the sitter. Like if my MIL handed my 8 month old an expensive watch to play with and baby banged it on something or threw it (like they're pretty much expected to at that age) I wouldn't expect her to expect me to replace it.", "So... Shrimp, tripe, fresh caught fish, etc. never belong in a kitchen?  Or food prep and sanitation is important?  I'mma go with the second.", "A few years ago I read a thread with keen interest, trying along with others to puzzle out what was happening.  Someone said they had difficulty hand-washing their dishes because they didn't like that they had to hold them under running water for the whole wash and rinse. Others kept replying, asking why they couldn't fill a sink, why they couldn't set the dirty dishes in one sink, and so on, but that original Someone kept saying that was gross, and their dishes would be disgusting. There was considerable back-and-forth of people offering suggestions and that Someone always replied they couldn't do the suggestion because it would be gross. Finally the question was tentatively asked, \"Wait, do you not clean your kitchen sink?!?\" And there was the answer. This Someone chucked gross things into their kitchen sink *and never cleaned their sink.* They'd hold stuff under running water to clean it and yet leave muck to build up on the sink itself. \n\nIt's surprising just how often I think of this story, and it's a great illustration of how to not assume *anything.*\n\nJust wanted to share. Go on with your day.", "Put the baby in the dishwasher, problem solved.", "Not even that far back. OP is 18, which puts them at being born around 04-05. That's hardly \"different times\" (although it is pre-tea party and trump. Oh, the good old days...)", "I have photos of me being bathed in the kitchen sink, back before specialised \"baby baths\" were a thing for companies to make money off new parents. Cynical, moi? It's perfectly normal and natural, and as you point out, easier!", "I agree. Sink is fine. Everyone is acting crazy. I mean, you couldn\u2019t not bathe the baby. There wasn\u2019t an alternative here.", "When my kids were born, the midwives bathed them in\u2026 a sink! It looked exactly like a kitchen sink. Your parents need to get Rowan seen by someone because destructiveness isn\u2019t normal.", "She's 18 with a newborn, she didn't choose to be in this world her parents brought her to life and their responsibilities towards their kids do not stop here, they should support them in any way or form as long as they can especially with this economy", "How is OP supposed to dry the baby bath? It wasn't negligence in their part - it has to be left out to dry for a short period of time.\n\nAt what point is the little sister being taught respect for other people's property?? Who is responsible for watching the little sister? Who was supposed to watch her when she had the opportunity to break it? Should they be held responsible maybe?", "Why no bleach?", "I love your comment\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "And now there is coffee on my TV, guess I need to wash it in her sink", "I'm going to start suggesting this to baby parents XD", "Tbf it does say \"their first kid\" who was born in the late 90s. But also, her youngest sister is 2, so that was the dark ages of ... 2021.", "Not disagreeing. Just not seeing the importance of the c-section", "OMG, I know you most likely mean a small dog, but I just visualized trying to bathe my Great Dane in the kitchen sink \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I remember my mom washing my brothers and my feet in the sink until we were to big to sit on the counter, never mind fit in the sink! We were each about 10 when she stopped that.", "My mom just stuck a laundry basket in the bathtub with and inch of water in it and bathed me in that. I mean, it was 1979, and they were poor college students but you gotta do what you gotta do!", ">My mom (66) never had one of those special baby baths. She thought it was silly and impractical when you had the kitchen sink right there.\n\nThey are. As long as your sink is safe & easily accessible, & you are Abled, the bath bath isn't a necessity but a luxury.", "Not just a US thing. Bathroom washbasins in every country I\u2019ve been in are way smaller than the kitchen sink.", "I can't even fit a water bottle under the faucet in my washroom.  In USA kitchen faucets are taller, and kitchen sinks are larger than washroom ones, and kitchen faucets often come with a convenient hose mini-shower.  That said, OP should've lined the sink with some plastic wrap or foil if only to keep food germs from getting onto the baby.", "I wasn't referring to this case specifically. My opinion was for the \"the parent is responsible if their kid breaks it\" because I assumed you were talking about in general.", "Not that I ever had one but it's probably kind of difficult to bow down after your belly has been cut open and is still healing.", "You're going to need a bigger sink...", "I pictured a big ass dog too, then realized I'm an idiot, ha ha", "Well. You could wash their nose. Maybe a paw at a time. Maybe their butt depending how great of a Great Dane?", "That's a good idea, honestly", "I still sit in the sink in the bathroom to do my makeup lol lighting is really good \nClean feet tho but still", "That wasn't very clear from your original comment...", "Didn't consider that. That's actually fair. I apologize.", "Haha I laughed at this - I\u2019m always paraphrasing that particular line from Jaws myself \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude06", "Where do you live? I'm irish and most bathroom sinks wouldn't be suitable for bathing a baby, they're too shallow and small", "I figured me bringing up a completely different example made that clear but apologies.", "Most cookie dough is safe to eat raw now."]}
