I still live with my parents, my older sister, Jo, (25f), and younger two sisters (Alisha 17f, Rowan 2f). My 2 year old sister is a terror. Anything she can break at the moment, she will. My parents are working really hard at teaching her that's wrong, but they've also expressed to me and my sisters that its our responsibility to keep stuff we can't have/don't want broken away from her and out of her reach, our things are our responsibility. \n\nSomething I've been fairly vigilant about keeping away from Rowan was the infant bath. Rowan liked to use it as a \"jumper\", couldn't figure out why it was wrong. I stored it in my wardrobe when it wasnt in use, except for when it was drying post-bath time. \n\nYesterday, Rowan managed to get at it, and managed to tear the sticking between the mesh and the fabric. It was cheap enough but due to the fact my car deciding to play dead a week earlier and cost me an arm and a leg, I haven't been able to buy a new one for another two weeks. \n\nMy parents won't replace it because it was something that was my responsibility. They have replaced things worth a lot of money that she's broken, but are putting their foot down with this. \n\nMy baby had a blowout today, in the hair kinda job, she obviously needed a bath, and I remember my parents bathing Rowan, also covered in poop, in the kitchen sink when she was a newborn. There's pictures of me and newborn Alisha in the sink together. So it's clearly something they were alright with at some point. \n\nI was bathing her when Jo came in and started giving out that it was disgusting and unhygienic to bathe baby in the sink, but I pointed out that our parents did it with us, and she said it's different because our parents were raising their first kid in different times and were stuck in their ways by the last. I said I didn't feel comfortable putting her in the bath without a seat and I was especially uncomfortable with taking her into the shower with me.\n\nMy mom got involved and my sister said her point, and mom said my sisters opinion should matter here, my dad thinks I wasn't in the wrong, and asked did they expect me to take the baby into the garden and give her a blast with the hose or something. It doesn't matter much, but alisha also agrees with me here, because again, baby needs a bath.\n\nJo is still harping on and my mom is defending her.

Do what you have to do.", "NTA.  I have \\*memories\\* of being bathed in the sink.  There's nothing wrong with it.  I would suggest cleaning before and after, but other than that, no worries.  Baby bathtubs are great but sinks serve the same purpose.", "Tell Jo to get over it and move on. The baby needed a bath, it's done. It's actually dangerous just to take a baby into a shower, you could slip and drop the baby. The full size bath probably would have been ok but if you're not confident then sink is fine. My dad used to have his bath in the sink. As far as hygiene. The Japanese separate their bathing cos why would you want to have a bath near a toilet where there is faecal matter. I don't really get the hygiene comment, you're washing the baby with soap and water so it seems appropriate. I mean people wash food in a sink and wash clothes in a sink. As long as you wipe other surfaces the baby might have touched.", "NTA. Sink bathing is so normal. And safe! My midwife recommended it, even. \n\nYou're doing good with a really difficult spot. Good luck.", " NTA. The sink can be cleaned.

Lots of people do this.", "NTA \n\nYou do what you have to do.\n\nBoth of my boys were to big for most infant bathtubs.   I used to roll a towel up to place under their heads/necks and put just a little bit of water in the tub.  Yes, I ended up with a sopping wet towel,  but it works for us and other babies in the family.  It might work for you, and save a bit of money that could go towards other needs.", "NTA.  We actually had a mesh lounger thing when mine were tiny that went in the sink for that very reason.", " NTA.  One of my fondest childhood memories is being bathed in the big porcelain kitchen sink. I could watch the older kids playing in the yard. The spray hose was gentle and warm on my head, and I almost never got soap in my eyes.  I was very disappointed when I outgrew the sink.\n\nAnd your parents are TA for not replacing your baby's  tub. Their child destroyed it. They should replace it. Offloading responsibility to the victim is a dangerous strategy.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a tough spot, and so are your family members. Sounds like you\u2019re doing your best.

If they don't want you to wash the baby in the sink, they need to replace the bath you bought specifically for that purpose that their child broke. Your parents are far and away the AH for that.

I had four kids and had a baby bathtub and they still got a bath in the damn kitchen sink; poop and all!! What is wrong with people thinking that with all these now founded gadgets that you can\u2019t bathe your kids the old fashioned way?!! Hide your boobs when you breastfeed due to making others uncomfortable? Two words: FUCK THAT! What do you think was used a a bottle in the old days? A damn tit!

Use fucking bleach! Tell everyone to chill and gift them a bottle of Clorox!", "NTA. Your parents did the same with you. I would talk with them and say that is why you thought it was OK.

Sounds like you are disinfectanting the sink properly. It's not much different than kitchen utensils used for raw food preparation! That being said, have you ever heard of a Blooming Bath Flower??? These are flower shaped baby bath mats that fit most sized sinks to help cushion the babies while bathing. The best part is they are very quick to clean up, just wring them out and then air dry. You can also wash them in the washing machine; great for when blowouts happen! I personally always recommend these to new moms, and I believe them to be quite popular. Perhaps take a look at Buy Buy Baby since they are closing stores, may find one for a great price. Hope this helps!", "NTA", "NTA!  Get the baby clean.  That's what matters.

If you want to keep the peace clean her with wipes then take a shallow bath with her. I used to relish the downtime when baby and I could chill in the tub for a bit.

The fact your Mum is supporting her when she did with you is weird", "NTA I have 12 nieces and nephews and one of my own and EVERY damn one was bathed in the sink when they were little. It's safer! They are slippery little suckers when wet! Bathtub is too big also why isn't anyone complaining about the bathtub getting dirty. I'm rolling my eyes so hard it's giving me a headache. Use some baking soda and vinegar and clean the sink and voila... It's prob cleaner than when you started. Sorry girl. Being a new mom is stressful enough. All the best.", "Wow! Proof the world has gone to shit! Of course you're NTA! I used to bathe my babies in the kitchen sink all the time. Perfect height to avoid backaches, easy to clean. There are probably more germs from the dish rag than from your baby. Disinfect the sink before the bath!", "I basically only bathe my kid in the kitchen sink. Dawn and hot water after, bleach if they poop. Done. No big deal. It\u2019s also so much easier that the big tub once they get a little bigger. Hell I still put my 4 yo in there sometimes to wash her hair more easily.\n\nEdit: NTA. At all. Not even a tiny bit.", "NTA. Ive seen plenty of family photos of mothers bathing babies in the kitchen sink. \n\nlol, if you watch The Incredibles jack jack is getting bathed in the sink too \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Of course you bathe a baby in the sink, for as long as they fit.", "I washed my daughter in the sink until she was too big for it. The only important thing is to make sure that you move everything away from that area that could be pulled in and get \" dirty \" and that you properly disinfect it afterwards. I always used bleach because I am very picky about the whole germ / dirt thing. But there are other disinfectants that could be used I'm sure. I just always like to make sure everything is actually clean like safe clean.", "NTA.  My Three kids and their two cousins all had plenty of sink baths.  We prefer it until they are older cause bending over the tub is hard on the back.  I would put the 5 week old in a big bowl with a big towel to keep it from slipping and hitting her head.  \n\nSure their opinions matter but it\u2019s not like your reinventing the wheel here.  Bathe the baby, and rinse out the sink after.  Clean with some cleaner if it makes everyone feel better.  \n\nCongrats on the baby!  Please make sure to sleep as much as possible.", "NTA, but you can get a free baby bath on Facebook marketplace. Try Facebook buy nothing groups in your area as well. People are always getting rid of baby stuff.", "blast a NEWBORN with a HOSE? NTA. keep bathing that baby in the sink until you can get her a seat. a surprising amount of infant harm comes from leaving baby in the bath unattended for even a few seconds", "NTA.  Tell Jo to lighten up.", "NTA \n\nAlso you can fold a thick towel and lay it in the tub, opposite side of the shower for the baby to lay on and not slide around with just a bit of water or the shower on towards their feet. Also helpful for when they baby is sitting up but still wobbly.", "NTA. I bathed all my children in the sink. Clean it before/after you\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t let people make you doubt yourself. Keep your head up. You got this.", "NTA As long as you cleaned the sink before & after the bath no problem. Your parents however are the anoles your baby sister broke your baby\u2019s (their grand baby\u2019s ) Bath tub and the response is well you shouldn\u2019t have left it to dry WTF. It\u2019s the fault of your parents that you don\u2019t have a bath tub for your baby so if your mom has a problem with it then she needs to go buy a new bath tub.", "NTA. \n\nGood God. You are fine. You have enough to deal with without worrying about if it's okay to wash your baby in the sink. Where are you washing her clothes? Not in the washer I hope? Take them outside and beat them on a rock!", "NTA. I have bathed every single one of my four kids in the sink. My wife got some plastic seat thing that fits in the tub or sink. I never used the tub, as the sink is higher up and I don't have to bend over. The sink is there for cleaning dirty things. Some times I don't know where the thing is so I just use the sink. How is poo any worse or less hygienic that rotten/moldy food? A while back my three old said she wanted a bath in the sink to. I let her do it by herself. She has a blast.\n\n\nAlso if your kids had poo in their hair. You are entitled to do pretty much whatever you want to address the situation. Like if you did use the garden hose. I would support that as well. I would not be mad if you took my pillow case to wipe the kid down first. I can wash it  You are dealing with an angry kid covered in poo, that is likely moving around and making things worse. You do what you need to do. Poo is the common enemy of us all. Sacrifices must be made for our continued poo free existence.", "This is so wacky to me!! Say you picked up the baby to change her and got some \u201cmess\u201d on your hands\u2026 Would you not then go wash your hands in the sink?? Do they have an issue with that as well? NTA obviously.", "NTA.  There is nothing wrong with using the sink. Lots of nasty things go in the sink to get clean.", "NTA.  It\u2019s still common to do that.  And a lot safer than some options.  You just clean it properly beforehand", "NTA. There were safety reasons not to bathe her in the tub, but was no safety reason not to bathe her in the sink, as long as you cleaned it both before and after.", "NTA.  I think your parents should have replaced the infant bath.  This \u201cyour responsibility\u201d thing is nonsense, your 2yo sister is their kid, not yours.  If your daughter destroyed all their stuff would they seriously just buy new stuff without complaint?  I doubt it.", "NTA. There's bleach for that. They can stay away from the baby then if it's gonna be like that.", "OP is more bothered about her daughter's safety than a few germs which are likely already present, and it's very odd that her mother doesn't realise this - having been in the exact same scenario. Pretty sure almost everybody bathes their new baby in the kitchen sink at some point. People are just so funny/weird/strange/odd/all of the above - even our own families. \nNAH at all. Obvs as long as clean down after which anyone with any self respect or pride would do anyway. \nAnd if the toddler has taken the baby bath from OP's wardrobe then i don't see how she can possibly be responsible for replacing it.", "NTA.  I bathed my long haired cat in the sink when he had diarrhea and his bottom was a mess.  Ugh!  Much easier than the bathtub with a wriggling, protesting cat but it had to be done!  I only dunked and washed his hind legs and backside which was a mess:(.", "NTA. And I assume after you bathed your kid you washed the sink down? Disinfectant? I have 8 niblings and 1 great nibling. ALL of them and my son have been given a kitchen sink bath at some point early in their lives because it\u2019s easier than hauling out the baby bath, and safer than using the big bath or laundry trough.", "NTA. As a new mother you were concerned about your babies safety first and foremost. A sink can be disinfected after cleaning the baby, but if something happened to your baby bathing them without the baby bath (it only takes looking away for a second for something to happen), or you dropped them showering together (babies are like so goddamn slippery) you will never forgive yourself.", ">my dad thinks I wasn't in the wrong, and asked did they expect me to take the baby into the garden and give her a blast with the hose or something\n\nhilarious/terrible mental image. hilarible.", "In my family it was normal and when we had our kid and I did it my wife freaked on me\n Ah well.", "NTA. Baby bathtubs don't work as well as people claim. They're bulky, the water goes cold super fast, just inconvenient overall. All kids all went right in the sink. Everyone lived.", "NTA man, baby needs a bath. Although if you can find one for cheap, my sister was here recently and we used a biggish plastic tub to bathe her kid - he's 3mo now but I'm fairly sure he's still smaller than mine was at birth.", "Yeah not a big deal as long as you clean it. \n\nI had a housemate who lost her shit when I used the kitchen sink to mop. A stainless steel sink that I cleaned with disinfectant afterwards lol. People are fucking ridiculous. \n\nNTA. NAH? I never know which one to use but yeah, you're fine.", "NTA. I\u2019m one of those people who\u2019s strongly against bathing babies in sinks for multiple reasons. \nHowever, in your case, what exactly were you supposed to do? As long as it\u2019s fully disinfected before and after, it\u2019s the only reasonable and safe option.", "I would argue that you should scrape and wipe *as much as possible* off the kid first.", "NTA, I bathed my infant in the sink. He\u2019s great. Just get one of those inflatable baby baths that fit in the tub.", "I bathed my child in the kitchen sink.  I didn't have to bend down or sit on the bathroom floor, and I had better grip over a wet and slippery infant at that level.  Very easy to clean afterwards.", "That is brilliant use of their own logic.", "Definitely have seen pictures of baby me getting bathed in the kitchen sink", "Agree! OP is definitely NTA.", "Sounds like you don't know how to clean properly.", "Maybe....just maybe....something wasn't cooked correctly. Let's really think about this....what in the every-loving- fuck was cooked or prepared in a kitchen sink that wouldn't be the cooks fault for preparing their food in an unsanitary environment that wouldn't be their fault? If I'm hosting, I'm sanitizing absolutely everything and checking twice. I do this even if it is my fiance and I. This is just common practice for any person who knows their way around a kitchen. Just to edit....NTA!", "Then she didn\u2019t clean after. Bleach works a charm killing E. coli.", "And assuming OP has a spare 20 bucks.", "I see you\u2019ve been to my home", "Most of my baby pics are of me in a kitchen sink with my wet, soapy hair shaped up into mohawks and devil horns while I stared into the camera like I couldn't figure out if it was a monster or something good to eat.  And that was a long, long time ago.  People have been tossing their kids into kitchen sink baths for as long as there have been kitchen sinks.  NTA.", "If you want a good compromise, when I was a baby my mom put a special plastic tub in the kitchen sink and bathed me in that. Sometimes that extra layer of plastic makes a difference in people's minds.", "Bathed my kid in the sink til he was like 6 months old", "I\u2019m sorry but if your sister destroyed the baby\u2019s tub I think your parents should replace it.  Especially since it sounds like she got to it in your room.  \n\nAlso if you do have access to a tub you can place a towel in it and the baby on the towel and fill with very little water.  \n Truthfully the only right way to bath an infant is to make sure they don\u2019t inhale water and not to leave them unattended.  When my first was born 13 years ago the hospital taught me and my husband how to bathe her (I knew, hubby didn\u2019t) I almost crapped my self because they showed us how to do so in a huge sink that was about three feet deep and filled with water.  Months later me and my husband took baths with her with lots of water all the time.  Every country does it different.", "I used to bathe my son in the sink. He just turned 3 so it really wasn't very long ago. I find it rather hypocritical of your mom though.", "I bathed mine in the bathroom sink because it was big enough.  The consumerist approach of a product being needed for every activity of life is getting way out of control.  There were so many 'essential' baby products I did not buy and never felt the need for.", "No but this one was actively covered in poop.", "Well besides your disgusting chicken habit, I'd hope that you wipe down your sink and counters sooooo what's the difference?\n\nYou use your hands to clean up baby poo and then wash your hands before you eat a sandwich.  What's the difference?", "Oh definitely.  The ergonomics are significantly better than being on your knees beside the bathtub.", "lol one of my favorite baby pictures is me being bathed in the sink, with that same soapy mohawk and devil horns. also clapping my chubby little hands and excitedly blowing bubbles out of my mouth.\n\ndamn i gotta find out who in my family has that photo bc now i wanna blow it up into a poster.", "Bathroom sinks are tiny. Even for little babies that's not big enough.", "Yeah no I'm pretty sure OP didn't leave baby poo everywhere, I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt on that one", "That's.... fowl. I'll see myself out.", "Not where I live. But fair enough.", "They're saying to clean where the baby touched because the baby was actively covered in poop. Give them the benefit of the doubt while you're at it.", "Damn, your mom is a superhero!", "Yeah we've already covered this, what do you want?", "Okay."]}
