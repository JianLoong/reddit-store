I still live with my parents, my older sister, Jo, (25f), and younger two sisters (Alisha 17f, Rowan 2f). My 2 year old sister is a terror. Anything she can break at the moment, she will. My parents are working really hard at teaching her that's wrong, but they've also expressed to me and my sisters that its our responsibility to keep stuff we can't have/don't want broken away from her and out of her reach, our things are our responsibility. \n\nSomething I've been fairly vigilant about keeping away from Rowan was the infant bath. Rowan liked to use it as a \"jumper\", couldn't figure out why it was wrong. I stored it in my wardrobe when it wasnt in use, except for when it was drying post-bath time. \n\nYesterday, Rowan managed to get at it, and managed to tear the sticking between the mesh and the fabric. It was cheap enough but due to the fact my car deciding to play dead a week earlier and cost me an arm and a leg, I haven't been able to buy a new one for another two weeks. \n\nMy parents won't replace it because it was something that was my responsibility. They have replaced things worth a lot of money that she's broken, but are putting their foot down with this. \n\nMy baby had a blowout today, in the hair kinda job, she obviously needed a bath, and I remember my parents bathing Rowan, also covered in poop, in the kitchen sink when she was a newborn. There's pictures of me and newborn Alisha in the sink together. So it's clearly something they were alright with at some point. \n\nI was bathing her when Jo came in and started giving out that it was disgusting and unhygienic to bathe baby in the sink, but I pointed out that our parents did it with us, and she said it's different because our parents were raising their first kid in different times and were stuck in their ways by the last. I said I didn't feel comfortable putting her in the bath without a seat and I was especially uncomfortable with taking her into the shower with me.\n\nMy mom got involved and my sister said her point, and mom said my sisters opinion should matter here, my dad thinks I wasn't in the wrong, and asked did they expect me to take the baby into the garden and give her a blast with the hose or something. It doesn't matter much, but alisha also agrees with me here, because again, baby needs a bath.\n\nJo is still harping on and my mom is defending her.

Do what you have to do.", "NTA.  I have \\*memories\\* of being bathed in the sink.  There's nothing wrong with it.  I would suggest cleaning before and after, but other than that, no worries.  Baby bathtubs are great but sinks serve the same purpose.", "Tell Jo to get over it and move on. The baby needed a bath, it's done. It's actually dangerous just to take a baby into a shower, you could slip and drop the baby. The full size bath probably would have been ok but if you're not confident then sink is fine. My dad used to have his bath in the sink. As far as hygiene. The Japanese separate their bathing cos why would you want to have a bath near a toilet where there is faecal matter. I don't really get the hygiene comment, you're washing the baby with soap and water so it seems appropriate. I mean people wash food in a sink and wash clothes in a sink. As long as you wipe other surfaces the baby might have touched.", "NTA. Sink bathing is so normal. And safe! My midwife recommended it, even. \n\nYou're doing good with a really difficult spot. Good luck.", " NTA. The sink can be cleaned.

Lots of people do this.", "NTA \n\nYou do what you have to do.\n\nBoth of my boys were to big for most infant bathtubs.   I used to roll a towel up to place under their heads/necks and put just a little bit of water in the tub.  Yes, I ended up with a sopping wet towel,  but it works for us and other babies in the family.  It might work for you, and save a bit of money that could go towards other needs.", "NTA.  We actually had a mesh lounger thing when mine were tiny that went in the sink for that very reason.", " NTA.  One of my fondest childhood memories is being bathed in the big porcelain kitchen sink. I could watch the older kids playing in the yard. The spray hose was gentle and warm on my head, and I almost never got soap in my eyes.  I was very disappointed when I outgrew the sink.\n\nAnd your parents are TA for not replacing your baby's  tub. Their child destroyed it. They should replace it. Offloading responsibility to the victim is a dangerous strategy.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a tough spot, and so are your family members. Sounds like you\u2019re doing your best.

If they don't want you to wash the baby in the sink, they need to replace the bath you bought specifically for that purpose that their child broke. Your parents are far and away the AH for that.

I had four kids and had a baby bathtub and they still got a bath in the damn kitchen sink; poop and all!! What is wrong with people thinking that with all these now founded gadgets that you can\u2019t bathe your kids the old fashioned way?!! Hide your boobs when you breastfeed due to making others uncomfortable? Two words: FUCK THAT! What do you think was used a a bottle in the old days? A damn tit!

Use fucking bleach! Tell everyone to chill and gift them a bottle of Clorox!", "NTA. Your parents did the same with you. I would talk with them and say that is why you thought it was OK.

Sounds like you are disinfectanting the sink properly. It's not much different than kitchen utensils used for raw food preparation! That being said, have you ever heard of a Blooming Bath Flower??? These are flower shaped baby bath mats that fit most sized sinks to help cushion the babies while bathing. The best part is they are very quick to clean up, just wring them out and then air dry. You can also wash them in the washing machine; great for when blowouts happen! I personally always recommend these to new moms, and I believe them to be quite popular. Perhaps take a look at Buy Buy Baby since they are closing stores, may find one for a great price. Hope this helps!", "NTA", "NTA!  Get the baby clean.  That's what matters.

Next time do as your dad suggests: blast the kid off with the hose outside, making sure it \"accidentally\" sprays their cars. I mean, it's not the kitchen sink now, right?", "NTA \n\nThat is where I bathe my dog. It is so much easier on your back and safer for all involved. \n\nI laughed at your dad's comment.", "Ynta, it's fine ro bath baby in a sink \n\nBath seats aren't safe for babies in general anyway", "NTA.

If you want to keep the peace clean her with wipes then take a shallow bath with her. I used to relish the downtime when baby and I could chill in the tub for a bit.
