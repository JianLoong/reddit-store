However, at some point, my friends suggested I told my parents what was going on since whatever happened to me is a big deal. I agreed - the whole situation was traumatising for me. I told my parents as I thought getting extra help would be good. This was where everything went down hill.\n\nMy mum was extremely supportive, she reassured me that I will get through this and everything will be fine. My dad on the other hand, made one of the worst decisions ever. He decided to threaten the other person who I filed a complaint against. I only discovered this recently but my dad has been texting the other person and their family, threatening them for over a month. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, the other party reported my dad to the police for threatening them and my dad was served a court order (I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t clear, I\u2019m not quite sure how the whole court thing works). The other party then made an offer to my dad: if I retract my complaint, they will retract their police report. I was not made aware of this offer until my mum told me the day before I was meant to meet my lawyer.\n\nAll three of us went to meet with the lawyer. I expected things would be explained to me of what my options were and whether I will actually have to retract my complaint or not. However, none of this happened. My dad didn\u2019t even ask me for my opinion. He just said to my lawyer \u201cShe will retract the complaint\u201d and proceeded to tell me to sign all the relevant documents. My dad never once asked for my opinion despite knowing how important this complaint was to me - it was my only hope of getting some justice as well as getting whatever\u2019s left of my dignity back. I told him no, I will not be signing anything and will not retract my complaint. He called me stupid and that I was being ungrateful. He also told me that if I were to get sued for my complaint, it won\u2019t be any of his business and he will not help me in any way whatsoever. This was as good as telling me he was going to cut ties. I was hurt by this greatly. He didn\u2019t care to ask for what I wanted and now he was insulting me. In the end, I was pressured by the lawyer and my dad to retract my complaint. I just wanted the barrage of insults to end.\n\nI understand why my dad was threatening the other party. I know he did it for me although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to go about things. However, his actions and his insults made me cut ties with him. I refuse to talk to him to this day. My mum keeps telling me how I\u2019m being difficult and ungrateful for not wanting to have anything to do with my dad anymore. Am I overreacting? AITA to my dad?", "created_utc": 1678885039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rvl3w/aita_for_disowning_my_family_and_refusing_to_talk/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
