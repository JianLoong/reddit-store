When we first started the relationship I would smoke and vape a decent amount since I\u2019ve done it before then, she had a coping mechanism which was not the best so I helped her through the whole thing cause I love feeling helpful but I also let her go through it herself so she would not have to depend on me being there since I can\u2019t be there every minute of the day. She\u2019s about 2 years clean and I (20m) decided to stop smoking and vaping around 1 year ago. She recently told me that she smokes/vapes whenever she\u2019s around friends and she\u2019s told me she doesn\u2019t like how I used to do it a lot so I decided to stop doing it for my health and for her too so it could give me a bit more of motivation. Yesterday she went with her friends and decided to take a video of Herself vaping and showed it to me when she got home. Yes she was drunk so she could have messed up but I followed up the next day to tell her how I didn\u2019t appreciate her showing me the video especially when I\u2019ve been trying to stop doing it for her and for me. She said it\u2019s not bad and that there\u2019s a difference between vaping and smoking \ud83c\udf43 and I said they can be different but it still reminds me of when I used to do it since it\u2019s pretty much the same process, she ended up telling me I was the a hole for saying this in a way where she thought I was telling her off. Am I the a hole for telling her that I don\u2019t like it if she\u2019s vaping when I\u2019m trying to stop?\n\nI can see where I could be the a hole since she\u2019s grown now and she knows what\u2019s best for her well being, and since I might have came at her aggressively saying I didn\u2019t appreciate it and that it hurt seeing that.", "created_utc": 1667169341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhsacn/aita_if_my_girlfriend_of_2_years_started/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have the right to express your concern, but you do not have the right to dictate her actions.

It sounds like you do not want her to bring something around you or show you something because you are still batteling that addiction. And that is absolutly reasonable and if she doesnt want to understand that, it is saying a lot about her and her level of support.", "YTA.\n\nYou spent a year into your relationship smoking and vaping insensitively infront of her when you **knew** she had a bad coping mechanism.\n\nYou decided to stop, good for you.

My goal is to just be done with that and if she shows me videos in the future then it\u2019ll be fine since it will have been years since doing it.", "Yeah my thing is I don\u2019t care if she does vape or smoke, that\u2019s not my decision to make she\u2019s her own person and I\u2019m myself and if she ever wants to quit I would be happy to help, since I went through a similar thing but if she doesn\u2019t want to stop then that\u2019s her decision she\u2019s an adult. I just feel like for someone that cares about me I don\u2019t think the best option would be like showing me that she does it.

I would edit the question if I was you because you arent asking her to quit. \n\nAnd just to be clear, you are being reasonable and quite patient to be honest. You need to set boundries for yourself, can you and should you be with someone who doesnt want to support you in your battle against addiction? If the answer is no, you need to choose yourself even if that is incredibly painfull.", "Yeah I try my best to be as patient as possible and I try not to get mad over things that could get fixed by communicating since I came from a family who wouldn\u2019t do that, I can\u2019t see myself doing that to someone else, but I do agree with you when you say I should talk to her about boundaries, it was just out of the blue so I wasn\u2019t expecting something like that. We do have boundaries like most couples I personally just didn\u2019t expect that from her so I didn\u2019t really know to set that boundary"]}
