For example, she's strict on what he can eat but she'll let him keep playing and chase him around with a spoon of food. I don't have a strict menu for kids but when we're having a meal we're all at the table.\n\nShe wants him playing specific educational games and I mostly let my kids do whatever and just use learning opportunities. They're not behind at all on knowledge.\n\nShe doesn't want her kid out too much (worries about weather), i just prepare mine for the weather and we go out a lot.\n\nOn the other side she lets him decide things I don't think should be up to kids. For example if he wants to go to grandparents today and how long. I never force affection or things like that but if we're visiting as a family a 2 year old can't decide not to or how long exactly. She just lets the kid say no and listens to that even though he (my toddler also) changes up yes and no to the same question 5 times in 10 minutes. They will literally plan to go visit them which is a 2 hours drive and get up in the morning, if he says no they don't go. If he says he wants to an hour later they go then. I tell my kids you can play separately at their house after greetings if you're not up for hanging out but you're going.\n\nIf we're out together at the park, she lets him drag her to go home, then when he changes his mind they go back. I don't do that. My younger kid sometimes mention home, I say if we go it means we're no longer at the park for today and we play inside and they change their mind.\n\nAlso she wakes up much earlier than me and her son is on that schedule meanwhile my kids and I wake up later and I'd have to get up to watch hers.

In fact, it\u2019s pretty responsible for turning the opportunity down. It would not only be a huge change in routine for you, but also for your nephew. And toddlers develop fast. Changing his routine dramatically can be damaging. Acknowledging you cannot give the standard of care he needs is way more responsible than just taking him in. You honestly don\u2019t even need that justification in the first place, though. Caring for one child in general is a monumental task that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. If you cannot give him the life he needs, your family should be thankful that you didn\u2019t just go along with it", "NTA. She\u2019s asked, you said no. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely justified, but you don\u2019t need a justification to not want to mind someone else\u2019s kid for pay or not. In this case I wouldn\u2019t do it either. \n\nIf family are pressuring you, tell them you\u2019ll do it, but only according to your rules/lifestyle - then youre pushing the choice onto them. \n\nDon\u2019t get misdirected by their nonsense, and stick to, \u201cI\u2019ll mind him with these conditions, if you don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s your decision\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA, my sister knows that if one of her children is with me, I will treat them as my own. As such, they will follow my household rules. Your sister wants a favor. When one asks for a favor, they can accept it on your terms or leave it. How your household runs is your affair and no one else's. If she doesn't like it, she needs to find other arrangements. She sounds entitled and dismissive of your work and family life. I'd put her and any other family firmly in their place if I were you. Them belittling you and trying to make you feel like your family contributions and dynamic aren't valid or worthy, just so they can use you as they please, is disgusting. It works for you, its works for your husband, it works for your kids, so why do they matter? If they aren't feeding, financing, or (xxx) you, then their opinion doesn't matter.", "NTA\n\n>I've worked my whole life towards a lifestyle of not getting up early and not cooking all day\n\nThat's all there is to it. You and your husband decide what lifestyle your family has.\n\nIt's no one else's business.\n\nAnd no adult is entitled to expect you to change your life to make their life easier, especially not your sister. \n\nIf she can pay someone, she can pay someone who wants the job and is willing to follow her rules.", "NTA. You\u2019re working. Home yes but working. And even if you weren\u2019t. Your sister isn\u2019t entitled to you taking in her kid. She can arrange for care with someone else. And even more so if she expects you to follow all of her rules. Tbh I think managing to have a routine with kids that doesn\u2019t start early is brilliant! Also no is a full answer. I don\u2019t want to also use a full answer that doesn\u2019t require any explanations or follow up.", "NTA - your sister is going to raise a spoiled entitled kid who is running the family his way.", "It's not up to you to care for anyone else's child, no matter how convenient it would be for them if you did. That's not your problem. Their convenience is not a binding concern of yours. NTA.\n\nNeither of you would find the other's life and parenting styles compatible, and that will just be a source of future conflict. So, you're declining. As is your right.", "NTA OP\n\nYou don't need to uproot your life for taking in a kid whose lifestyle varies from yours. Sister is entitled to her parenting style but she has no right to force that on you. You'll be exhausted if you take in this kid, not to forget you have a job and two kids to look after.\n\n>I rejected taking him in and she's angry at me, the whole family thinks I'm wrong because they generally think I'm weird and my lifestyle is wrong (they don't think it's a real job unless it's morning to afternoon in office and I should get up early etc.). \n\nThere you go ! Sister will be angry no matter what you do. Also since your whole family thinks your lifestyle is wrong, why are they even bothering you to look after your nephew ? They can look after sister's child. Your family has no respect for you, your job and your lifestyle. Block them if they keep on harassing you.", "Why do parents have these quirky ways of raising their kids without actually being home to raise them that way? Like what is the point of having a regimented meal schedule if it's not possible to make said meals? \n\nI can understand why your sister wants you to care for her kid even if she's paying, there's a certain mental safety parents get from having someone they know. But just how the daycare would work with their rules, not yours, her kid would be subjected to your rules not the ones at home. Your time, your meals, your outside Vs inside activities, etc. And if she can't agree to those, she can find a nanny who will work with hers. NTA", "Thanks. Where we're from it's not at all unusual to take in your siblings kids and I truly take no issue with that but not on someone else's rules. Easy to get caught up in all that customary obligation stuff when that's all around you, even though in my value system it's not necessary to sacrifice as much  as I'd have to here", "Haha thanks I like to hear that. We're from a place with a lot of customs that kind of say you have to do something to help out the family but for me it always seemed like the burden of the customs simply breaks on the backs of those willing to sacrifice, rather than being a communal reciprocity thing", "Regardless of customs, understand family is a privilege not entitlement. Don't hesitate to cut them if they are toxic or disrespectful."]}
