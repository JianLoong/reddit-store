In fact, it\u2019s pretty responsible for turning the opportunity down. It would not only be a huge change in routine for you, but also for your nephew. And toddlers develop fast. Changing his routine dramatically can be damaging. Acknowledging you cannot give the standard of care he needs is way more responsible than just taking him in. You honestly don\u2019t even need that justification in the first place, though. Caring for one child in general is a monumental task that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. If you cannot give him the life he needs, your family should be thankful that you didn\u2019t just go along with it", "NTA.

I'd put her and any other family firmly in their place if I were you. Them belittling you and trying to make you feel like your family contributions and dynamic aren't valid or worthy, just so they can use you as they please, is disgusting.

Sister will be angry no matter what you do. Also since your whole family thinks your lifestyle is wrong, why are they even bothering you to look after your nephew ? They can look after sister's child. Your family has no respect for you, your job and your lifestyle. Block them if they keep on harassing you.", "Why do parents have these quirky ways of raising their kids without actually being home to raise them that way? Like what is the point of having a regimented meal schedule if it's not possible to make said meals? \n\nI can understand why your sister wants you to care for her kid even if she's paying, there's a certain mental safety parents get from having someone they know. But just how the daycare would work with their rules, not yours, her kid would be subjected to your rules not the ones at home. Your time, your meals, your outside Vs inside activities, etc. And if she can't agree to those, she can find a nanny who will work with hers. NTA", "Thanks. Where we're from it's not at all unusual to take in your siblings kids and I truly take no issue with that but not on someone else's rules. Easy to get caught up in all that customary obligation stuff when that's all around you, even though in my value system it's not necessary to sacrifice as much  as I'd have to here", "Haha thanks I like to hear that. We're from a place with a lot of customs that kind of say you have to do something to help out the family but for me it always seemed like the burden of the customs simply breaks on the backs of those willing to sacrifice, rather than being a communal reciprocity thing", "Regardless of customs, understand family is a privilege not entitlement. Don't hesitate to cut them if they are toxic or disrespectful.\n\nEdit: In case it wasn't clear I meant cut ties with them.", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of details, I say this every time - it is literally no one\u2019s responsibility to look after someone else\u2019s children, family or not.

No.\n\nNTA but your sister and family are.

She thinks that you are \"obligated\" to take him in.  \n\nYou are not. You don't need a reason to say no, but you have very solid ones anyways. \n\nMy family took in my cousin, my father's niece, as her mother moved to nursing care due to failing health.  \n\nShe was raised very poorly- no respect for authority, a compulsive liar, reading at a 3rd grade level at age 13,  and also a petty thief.

Interestingly enough, I took care of a friends child after school who learned quickly what the rules and expectations were at my house (he was 5) he blossomed knowing what boundaries were.  But when we visited him at his house, he would yell and hit his mother. He hit her once at my house when she came to pick him up and I reminded him he\u2019s not allowed to do that at my house (we were on the porch so he thought it was okay). I told him (in front of his mom) that it\u2019s not allowed at my house but he can hit his mother at hers.  She looked shocked. I told her I\u2019ve seen her allow it, but I don\u2019t tolerate such behavior. She allowed it. Two years later when I no longer took care of that boy, she couldn\u2019t find anyone to care for him because of the way she allowed him to behave in public (same as at their home).  Poor child.

Ie, she teaches them that they have to stick to a set routine, not their whims. \n\nThis child is going to have a *hell* of a time if they plan on putting them in mainstream school with this routine. Don't do it, don't apologise, just lay out your routine and tell her that this is how you are preparing your children for life, and the whole \"communal reciprocity thing\" relies on the community being able to work together. If her kid can't work with that, she better prepare them to.", "I fail to see how the way you are raising your kids is strange. It sounds completely reasonable.", "It honestly sounds like she'd let the kid veto daycare", "Her attitude in general. And when there is nothing important to do my children absolutely do decide what we do and when we do it when it is free things like the park and often we go to the park at least 2 times a day. Children should be playing outdoors as much as possible not cooped up at home", "Lol I love the edit. Thank you", "It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re cooped up at home. She sounds like totally normal reasonable mother. She just doesn\u2019t let her kids dictate and micromanage every second of their schedule. This is normal. At least to me?", "Children should be outside as much as possible. My children and most of the children I know are outside playing most of the day. In fact today my 3 younger children were outside from 9:30am til 5pm. 2 trips to the park and the rest of the time playing in the backyard. Every hour or so I would ask if they wanted to go inside and the answer was a firm no so we stayed outside. My 2 youngest even napped outside. \nNow if we had appointments, shopping etc to do they wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that but I don\u2019t believe in not letting them decide what we do unless their is a decent reason not to do so. And I don\u2019t believe in parents being controlling", "I did t read her take in that as controlling. The kids sound like they do get out and they go with her to errands, their grandparents, park, etc. I think she\u2019s just saying if they have plans the kids don\u2019t stop them. Like if they\u2019re getting ready for the park, they don\u2019t decide not to go right now or if they get there and want to leave in 10 minutes she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s how I read it anyway and it made total sense to me. It would also be hard to accommodate one child with this attitude when there are three to consider.", "\"OP is controlling because they don't do things exactly as I did!\""]}
