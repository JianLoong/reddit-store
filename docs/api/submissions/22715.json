In fact, it\u2019s pretty responsible for turning the opportunity down. It would not only be a huge change in routine for you, but also for your nephew. And toddlers develop fast. Changing his routine dramatically can be damaging. Acknowledging you cannot give the standard of care he needs is way more responsible than just taking him in. You honestly don\u2019t even need that justification in the first place, though. Caring for one child in general is a monumental task that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. If you cannot give him the life he needs, your family should be thankful that you didn\u2019t just go along with it", "NTA. She\u2019s asked, you said no. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely justified, but you don\u2019t need a justification to not want to mind someone else\u2019s kid for pay or not. In this case I wouldn\u2019t do it either. \n\nIf family are pressuring you, tell them you\u2019ll do it, but only according to your rules/lifestyle - then youre pushing the choice onto them. \n\nDon\u2019t get misdirected by their nonsense, and stick to, \u201cI\u2019ll mind him with these conditions, if you don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s your decision\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA, my sister knows that if one of her children is with me, I will treat them as my own. As such, they will follow my household rules. Your sister wants a favor. When one asks for a favor, they can accept it on your terms or leave it. How your household runs is your affair and no one else's. If she doesn't like it, she needs to find other arrangements. She sounds entitled and dismissive of your work and family life. I'd put her and any other family firmly in their place if I were you. Them belittling you and trying to make you feel like your family contributions and dynamic aren't valid or worthy, just so they can use you as they please, is disgusting.

You and your husband decide what lifestyle your family has.\n\nIt's no one else's business.\n\nAnd no adult is entitled to expect you to change your life to make their life easier, especially not your sister. \n\nIf she can pay someone, she can pay someone who wants the job and is willing to follow her rules.", "NTA. You\u2019re working. Home yes but working. And even if you weren\u2019t. Your sister isn\u2019t entitled to you taking in her kid. She can arrange for care with someone else. And even more so if she expects you to follow all of her rules. Tbh I think managing to have a routine with kids that doesn\u2019t start early is brilliant! Also no is a full answer.

Sister will be angry no matter what you do. Also since your whole family thinks your lifestyle is wrong, why are they even bothering you to look after your nephew ? They can look after sister's child. Your family has no respect for you, your job and your lifestyle. Block them if they keep on harassing you.", "Why do parents have these quirky ways of raising their kids without actually being home to raise them that way? Like what is the point of having a regimented meal schedule if it's not possible to make said meals? \n\nI can understand why your sister wants you to care for her kid even if she's paying, there's a certain mental safety parents get from having someone they know. But just how the daycare would work with their rules, not yours, her kid would be subjected to your rules not the ones at home. Your time, your meals, your outside Vs inside activities, etc. And if she can't agree to those, she can find a nanny who will work with hers. NTA", "Thanks. Where we're from it's not at all unusual to take in your siblings kids and I truly take no issue with that but not on someone else's rules. Easy to get caught up in all that customary obligation stuff when that's all around you, even though in my value system it's not necessary to sacrifice as much  as I'd have to here", "Haha thanks I like to hear that. We're from a place with a lot of customs that kind of say you have to do something to help out the family but for me it always seemed like the burden of the customs simply breaks on the backs of those willing to sacrifice, rather than being a communal reciprocity thing", "Regardless of customs, understand family is a privilege not entitlement. Don't hesitate to cut them if they are toxic or disrespectful.\n\nEdit: In case it wasn't clear I meant cut ties with them.", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of details, I say this every time - it is literally no one\u2019s responsibility to look after someone else\u2019s children, family or not.

You may respond to anyone making comments (including your sister) that you do not choose to have another child in your house. Her parenting style or their opinions may be dismissed.

No.\n\nNTA but your sister and family are.   For expecting you to make the changes, for deciding the way you live and raise your children, which sound pretty main stream to me and then berating you for not conforming to her demands.   They are probably jealous about your job too.\n\nSounds like you are raising well balanced, normal kids in a healthy and loving home.

You are never obligated to care for someone else's child, family or not. It's the parent(s)' responsibility to provide care for their offspring.

She thinks that you are \"obligated\" to take him in.  \n\nYou are not. You don't need a reason to say no, but you have very solid ones anyways. \n\nMy family took in my cousin, my father's niece, as her mother moved to nursing care due to failing health.  \n\nShe was raised very poorly- no respect for authority, a compulsive liar, reading at a 3rd grade level at age 13,  and also a petty thief.

Why would they want him around somebody weird?  Seriously, though, NTA. You and YOUR children come first. I\u2019ve taken care of family members children before but I would NOT have taken in the toddler you described.  Interestingly enough, I took care of a friends child after school who learned quickly what the rules and expectations were at my house (he was 5) he blossomed knowing what boundaries were.  But when we visited him at his house, he would yell and hit his mother. He hit her once at my house when she came to pick him up and I reminded him he\u2019s not allowed to do that at my house (we were on the porch so he thought it was okay). I told him (in front of his mom) that it\u2019s not allowed at my house but he can hit his mother at hers.  She looked shocked. I told her I\u2019ve seen her allow it, but I don\u2019t tolerate such behavior. She allowed it. Two years later when I no longer took care of that boy, she couldn\u2019t find anyone to care for him because of the way she allowed him to behave in public (same as at their home).  Poor child.

The *only* way I would do this (and I'd mostly outline it to show her how ridiculous her parenting style is if she wants her kid to be in care that isn't 1:1) is if she spent *at least* two weeks preparing her child for shared care. Ie, she teaches them that they have to stick to a set routine, not their whims. \n\nThis child is going to have a *hell* of a time if they plan on putting them in mainstream school with this routine. Don't do it, don't apologise, just lay out your routine and tell her that this is how you are preparing your children for life, and the whole \"communal reciprocity thing\" relies on the community being able to work together.

The textbook meaning of obligation is \"*an act or course of action to which a person is morally or legally bound; a duty or commitment*\"\n\nNo one is obliged to help anyone at all, period (maybe in some narrow legal cases people might be). The only person you have a duty to help is yourself. If you can't do that to a satisfactory level, nothing else matter.

There is no blanket principle on who / what to help. What I am saying is you should not feel bad for not wanting to help loved ones or friends if you have so decided. Well perhaps there are cases where help can be easily rendered. But there might be underlying reason a decision was made not to help and who are we to judge ? \n\nI definitely admire people who can give with all their hearts. But I just hope people understand that just because they do and they can does not automatically mean the reverse is a bad thing.\n\nTL;DR - Loved ones or friends does not automatically warrant a badge to demand and expect help.

If you're older and retired, you're not obligated to babysit your grandchild a couple of days so your kid can get a better job and until the daycare is ready to take the child if someone refuses to do that when they have to give up lunch dates with friends that's fine?
