And it seemed like I still had feelings for my ex. I assured my gf I don\u2019t have feelings for my ex and that I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in over a year. I just really enjoyed the plant and liked the pot. \n\nMy gf demanded I get rid of the plant and pot. She said I was acting like an ass for keeping it and holding onto feelings for my ex.

I\u2019d get rid of her tbh. And if she asks if it\u2019s because of the plant, you can tell her it\u2019s because of her attitude. \n\nMy bf has quite a few things his ex bought him. They\u2019re collectible figurines from his favourite anime\u2019s. A couple of them cost a pretty penny too. I would never dream of telling him to get rid of them because I know how much he loves them, not because they\u2019re from his ex but because he loves his collectibles and they\u2019re from his favourite anime.

So what, just because she can\u2019t afford to spend money on elaborate gifts for you, you have to get rid of every gift you\u2019ve ever got off your ex just to make her feel better? She needs some help if that\u2019s her reasoning. They\u2019re your things and you\u2019re the one who decides if you keep them or not because you like them, not because they\u2019re from your ex. You need to explain that to her.

It's hard to find, you like the plant, the pot is just a pot. There's nothing there? Your gf seems insecure to me. Maybe sit her down and have a talk about why she's feeling that way?

No one should ever demand such a thing.\n\nI have quite a lot of designer jewelry gifted by my ex and I still wear them occasionally as I like them. I sometimes even wear them when I go out with my husband. I also have plates gifted and we use them. Pictures on harddrive and in some old paper albums - still got it. This is the past I have and these people are who helped me become who I am today. And if it comes up, I do talk about them and I think it is just a normal part of life.", "NTA\n\nIt's a plant and a pot.

I\u2019m sure she\u2019s kept things from exes too, and a plant is about the plant not the person (same as a pet would be in a way). BUT I\u2019d still reassure them about your faithfulness if they\u2019re concerned and maybe move it to a less visible place at least when they\u2019re over? Definitely a deeper issue to address but at the same time I wouldn\u2019t want my significant other to have something their ex gave them front and centre in front of me", "NTA.  She\u2019s coming from a place of jealousy and insecurity.  I drink coffee made from the brewer my now wife\u2019s ex left behind.", "NTA. Why is your girlfriend so insecure? I have a frog mirror my first husband gave me.

You\u2019re doing nothing wrong unless you whisper sweet nothings to the plant and call it by your EX GFs name", "NTA\n\nYour current GF seems insecure.   You should take a serious look at whether she's a good fit for you.", "Hell nah NTA you gotta tell her that it's a plant, it was free, you like it and maybe point out that she's the one more worried about your ex than you are.", "NTA  If your gf is seriously jealous over a plant, then I'd dump the gf and choose the plant!\n\nWhat on earth does a plant have to do with you having feelings for your ex??!  The answer is, it doesn't have anything to do with it.  You have been with her for 3 months, and she's already giving you ultimatums on getting rid of the plant or never talk to you until you do?  Ludicrous.  She seems like an unreasonable person, and I would not tolerate her attempts to manipulate and control you.  Her behaviors are childish and I'd seriously reconsider whether you want to be nitpicked and bossed around in order to keep this relationship.", "NTA. She sounds terribly insecure and controlling.\n\nCripes, I have a couple of plants that I\u2019ve had for 25+ years through many relationships. First, no one has ever asked me the origin story. Second, I would not get rid of them for an idiot date. \n\nIf you do decide to get rid of it, at least sell it to someone who knows what it is and will value it.", "NTA.  You will carry away both good things And bad things from significant romantic relationships.  Mature partners will understand this.  Immature partners will not.    From your previous relationship you carried a new hobby and a nice plant.  These are good things.  An insecure partner is not a good thing.  \n\nPS.  My ex once gave me kitchen knives as a Christmas gift.  I still have them.  I have no lingering affection for the ex, but I am not going to get rid of a good set of kitchen knives.", "NTA\n\nSeems odd to get upset for keeping a plant. Its not a love letter or old photos.", "She is jealous of a ... plant???\n\nNTA", "NTA, keep the plant.  If she's not talking to you as long as you keep it you've dodged a bullet.   She's  petty, controlling and insecure.", "Yikes. She\u2019s freaked out over a plant. My dude, keep the plant and ditch the chick.", "NTA. Your girlfriend has issues, probably just projecting her own insecurities and feelings. I'll consider this behaviour as a red flag on my relationship", "nta - so what would you be allowed to keep from your ex? if she gave you a painting by Picasso... would she demand you to throw it away? \n\nFrom now on everytime you walk in to the kitchen make a bow towards the plant... if she understand the joke, she can stay... if not give her a cactus and send her away", "NTA, nothing wrong with you keeping it.", "It's a plant...... in a pot....that you like.  Your gf is being unreasonable.  NTA", "Very NTA. \n\nYour GF sounds jealous/ immature. You had a history with your ex - it is part of who you are. Gardening is part of your history and that experience made you who you are today. And her giving ultimatums (about getting rid of the plant first) is not quite a mature of communicating - adults should take to each other, and a partnership requires compromise. A possible compromise is you changing the pot (because it was handpainted by ex) as it probably is more \"meaningful\" than a store-bought pot, but keep the plant. (And if you do get rid of any trinkets, it should be on your terms, and maybe consider donating it to charity)", "What? \n\nThat is new... an ultimatum because of a plant in a pot she actually liked. \nAs a fellow plant lover i say keep the precious plant, pick the weed and throw her out! \nNo, to be honest that is so petty, you have been dating 3 months she doesn't get to decide what is in your appartement because she is jealous of a plant.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Keep the plant and lose the jealous gf!", "Nta get rid of her, she has issues.", "NTA. Keep the pot and plant that's been with you longer and ditch the girl", "NTA - Red flag girl friend, she is immature and jealous. She isn't old enough to understand that the past is the past. It's 3 months of dating, move on and find another.", "NTA does she really feel threatened because of a plant \ud83e\udd74", "NTA\n\nHear me out: The plant is a living organism that you have nurtured and something that you are passionate about. I think it would be valid to view this through the same lens one might use when considering an SO that disrespects someones kids or pets that are shared or a product of an ex. The situation at hand is obviously trivial compared to one where a kid is involved, but it's the same framework of fallible reasoning on her part. She's letting her emotions get in the way and interprets your passion for the plant as a lingering passion for a dead relationship. \n\nThat being said, I see where the pot itself might cause her to react this way. While the plant is a product of your effort, the pot is a product of your ex's effort. Could you move the plant into a new pot without the plant being damaged? If so that would be a reasonable compromise.", "NTA she sounds like a lot", "If you get enjoyment out of it, then ignore the girlfriend.  Honestly, jealousy at this point in your relationship is worrisome.\n\nIn the future, I would just tell future girlfriends that it was given to you by an old friend.  \n\nNTA.", "YTA if you ditch that plant to keep GF happy.

You have a healthy outlook on that plant, if you give in to her insecurity you won't be doing either of you a favour.", "NTA. I still have gifts my ex gave me, like clothes and such. I donated some things I had a strong emotional connection to but even though I'd never date my ex again I regret getting rid of them.", "NTA your girlfriend is jealous of a plant.", "NTA. Keep the plant, find a better girlfriend.", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds too insecure to be involved in a healthy relationship and you should probably remove yourself. It's only been 3 months and she's issuing you demands to get rid of stuff you like because she can't afford to buy that stuff for you? Toxic.", "Nta. You probably have cheese in your fridge older than this relationship, it's not on to be directed to throw away your lovely plant and pot. That's someone who is way too insecure.", "NTA\u2026..Gimme a break. My best friend had 3 paintings by her ex-husband in her home, and they weren\u2018t small, they were like 4\u2019 x 6\u2019  and no one thought it was weird at all. . Her current husband\u2019s reaction was basically \u201c Free art!\u201d.", "NTA. If she's showing so much insecurity and jealously this early into a relationship it might not be worth continuing it. You can try talking it out with her but if she keeps up this immature bout of pouting, I would just end it.", "Get rid of the GF, keep the plants.\n\nIf she\u2019s getting weird now, just imagine how she\u2019s going to be once she really gets comfortable.  Next she\u2019ll be banning you from hanging with your friends (female) then family.\n\nNTA", "Sure it was a gift but you have the plant because you like the plant, not because you like your ex. You're current GF is being really insecure and rather controlling. NTA", "She'd have such a great point if it was an engagement ring and not a stupid fucking plant pot.", "NTA, but\u2026 please temporarily rehome your plant. Because I imagine, as long as your girlfriend is jealous, she might take it out on the pot or plant, both of which are irreplaceable. I can one hundred percent see the plant becoming \u201cmysteriously\u201d poisoned, and the pot \u201caccidentally\u201d breaking.", "Demanded you get rid of a plant. Refuses to speak to you till you bow to her demands. This is all coming from someone you've known for 3 months? Wonder what a year would be like? Think you'll even recognize yourself? \n\nNTA keep the plant, ditch the psycho.", "NTA. Your gf is the one being weird. Who cares what you got from your ex. Keep the plant. The gf sounds controlling. Could be an early red flag to watch out for.", "Lucky the ex didn't give u a kidney.", "NTA. It\u2019s a freaking plant. That\u2019s some hardcore insecurity/jealousy/controlling issues she\u2019s got going there.", "As some redditors would say, keep the plant and get rid of the girlfriend.", "Ummm...\n\nSo with all that, you really think this a relationship you want to be in???\n\nShe's absolutely ridiculous! Projecting her sh*t on you.\n\nNta.", "NTA - respectfully, she\u2019s fucking weird, bordering on creepy. I consider myself to be on the jealous and insecure side at times but this is just ridiculous. She either wants control of everything you touch already (before \u201clove\u201d can be established really, in most cases) or she\u2019s wanting you to conform to her every demand, therefore controlling you.\nYou don\u2019t want this for the rest of your life, regardless of which one it is. \n\nMost of the plants in my house are given to me or other family members by someone. Most of them I can\u2019t even remember who, that\u2019s just what happens with plants. They\u2019re shared and passed on, or shared, clipped a little and passed on. This is Big Red Flag behaviour.", "NTA\n\nWhat you're doing is not weird or unreasonable in any way and I would not think keeping a plant means you still have feelings for an ex. Requesting you get rid of the plant is unreasonable. Your girl is feeling insecure and that's on her but maybe more loving and appreciating of her the next few weeks will help.", "NTA\n\nI will never understand people who want their past significant others erased out of their present lives. \n\nWe are the sum total of our experiences, you learn something from each one - or you should. You keep the good and leave the bad behind you if possible. In this case, good stuff involved a plant. Keep it and yourself in good health.", "You know your plant is going to mysteriously \u201cdisappear\u201d at some point, right? NTA", "How about a compromise? She buy a new pot for the plant you love. Or plant it somewhere you frequent if you plan to get rid of it.", "Exactly it's not like OP is still wearing his ex's wedding ring, it's a plant pot, one that was given probably years ago.\n\nGiving ultimatums at 3 months into a relationship is a huge no, and she's jealous over a plant? Yikes! If OP chooses to continue this relationship then he might want to put the plant and pot somewhere safe incase it \"accidentally\" gets broken.", "Any plant I can manage to keep alive for an extended amount of time stays. I don\u2019t care who gave it to me. But NTA. Lose the girlfriend if she can\u2019t handle it.", "NTA. THIS here. NOPE.  Get rid of the GF and keep the plant.", "> that if she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, she gives silent treatment\n\nThis OP, your gf is emotionally abusive and I doubt it will stop at the silent treatment.", "IKR? \"Oh, now that I've met your family I don't like your mother at all. You need to get rid of anything in your apartment she gave you. While you're at it, erase her from your DNA!\" /s\n\nIt's disturbing. I get it if it's something romantic or like a picture including her that's front and center or something (unless it's a memorial or there's kids involved in which case GTFO yesterday!) But anything else? \"Oh, you need to get rid of your dishes I liked because you told me your ex picked them out.\" Just F that. Nice belongings are nice belongings. Once something material is mine, it's mine. Doesn't matter where it came from, just the utility. NTA OP, I too, recommend dumping this woman.", "LMAOOOOOO", "Honestly the people that feel the need to destroy everything worry me more. Like I get it if they did something *terrible* to you and it feels good to cleanse yourself of anything that reminds you of them but just a normal break up? Yikes. My ex helped me dye my hair, should I cut all my hair off?", "I was worried I was the only one thinking this, new GF only needs a moment alone in the room to \u201caccidentally\u201d knock the plant over and shatter the pot", "I'm glad someone said it as it was my first thought on reading the title.\n\nBe careful OP. It only takes a moment and your plant will likely be gone if she has her way!", "Wait until she finds out that OP was completely introduced to his plant hobby by the EX, she will demand all the plants be gone!", ">It makes me suspect that she has problems with letting go of feelings for old BFs and therefore expects others to have the same problems.\n\nCrap, I completely forgot that angle. That's a totally valid possibility. She could possibly be one of those that gets pregnant by an ex and then tells you it's yours.", "Yeah I was going to bring up the same thing. Clearly the girlfriend's reaction and how she is going about this sucks and she's TA for that. But there is some merit to the idea that keeping an ex gf's hand painted pot is weird. And it's an easy fix. Just get rid of the pot. Although, he probably might want to get rid of the gf too because stonewalling someone and giving ultimatums for things like this, rather sitting down and having a mature/vulnerable conversation about your insecurities, is emotionally immature.", "This is exactly what I wanted to say. \n\nOP, as a gardener, I feel like your girlfriend doesn\u2019t realize plants are living things rather than decorations. There are many better girls out there, but you might not find another of those plants.", "Almost as bad as that guy that was jealous of the sun!!", "*if they stay together there will come a time he will* ***beg*** *for the silent treatment ...*", "That was one of my first thoughts too when I read this. Should OP continue this relationship then I hope he puts his plant/plant pot somewhere safe just incase so it doesn't end up \"accidentally\" broken or in the bin.", "A guy was jealous of the sun? Jeez, some people get jealous over strange things lol.", "All the plants. OP was introduced to the hobby by the ex after all.", "I went to the \"jealous of the sun\" link provided below; the original post has been removed although comments remain. \n\nSince I don't know what the OP said in that case, I'll just remind you that Labrinth had a hit with \"Jealous\" ... \"I'm jealous of the rain that falls upon your skin\" and so forth. Maybe that post was a riffus absurdus? :D", "Wish I had a copy of the post for you to read!!", "The automod automatically makes a copy of the OP, so if you sort by old you can see it easily. Its certainly one of the stranger posts I've seen here.\n\n>As a bit of background, my gf recently finished Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro. I haven\u2019t read the book but I understand it is about a robot who gets power from the sun.\n\n>For as long as I\u2019ve known her, my gf has always loved Summer and loves being outdoors but particularly when it\u2019s sunny. I love how outgoing she is as its very compatible with my lifestyle.\n\n>However, after finishing Klara in the Sun, my gf has started joking about the sun \u201cnourishing her,\u201d which I understand is how the robot in the book describes the sun as powering her up.\n\n>At first, it didn\u2019t bother me as it was just a funny turn of phrase but as we\u2019ve gone into Summer (we live in the Southern Hemisphere), she\u2019s getting out of the house on long walks without me and talking about the Sun\u2019s \u201cnourishment\u201d and more annoyingly \u201cHis nourishment\u201d more and more. She talks about how \u201cHe\u201d makes her feel warm and secure when she\u2019s outside and that she\u2019s so glad \u201cHe is back.\u201d Admittedly we\u2019ve had a miserable and wet Winter.\n\n>Some additional background, I was cheated on in my last serious relationship (didn\u2019t see it coming), so, naturally I can sometimes feel a bit insecure around my gf especially if she\u2019s getting interest from other men. I know it's something I need to work on and I've talked about it with my gf.\n\n>Anyway, for whatever reason, this increasing talk from my gf about the Sun \u201cnourishing her\u201d has really started to get under my skin.\n\n>I tried to bring it up with her diplomatically and explain the reasons why it was bothering me and whether she\u2019d maybe stop talking about \u201cHis nourishment\u201d or maybe we could spend more time together at home or I could join her on walks.\n\n>She flat out laughed in my face and told me stop being jealous of the sun and she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned on her walks \u201cwith\u201d the sun (her words not mine).\n\n>I got quite mad and said I didn\u2019t think she was being a good partner by not taking my needs or views seriously. She told me I was being ridiculous and left the house a few hours ago and won\u2019t return my texts or calls.\n\n>The sun\u2019s now gone down which makes me feel a bit mixed because I\u2019m worried about it getting dark and her safety but also glad she\u2019s not out in the sun to rub my feelings in my face.\n\n>To be clear It\u2019s not even about being jealous of the sun, I just don\u2019t think she was being respectful at all.\n\n>So yeah AITA for getting angry about my GF spending too much time in the sun?", "This the one?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ya40hg/aita\\_for\\_getting\\_angry\\_about\\_my\\_gf\\_spending\\_too/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ya40hg/aita_for_getting_angry_about_my_gf_spending_too/)", "Same, sounds strangely intriguing.
