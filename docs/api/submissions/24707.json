I say this because while she an adult and needs to get stuff done, people are different and I\u2019m sure being a caretaker and everything else SAHM\u2019s do is a lot. \n\nIt comes down to how she prioritizes things. Sometimes it can be overwhelming and it takes a lot to run a household and manage peoples needs (hers, yours, child etc). Consider her strengths and how she organizes other aspects of her/your lives and draw on that. For example, if she\u2019s someone who has trouble staying in task, an app like structured is good. (No I didn\u2019t create it) but many people I know use it and from what I\u2019ve seen, you can customize when you get alerts, you can have it set up in your home page and each task is timed as though it\u2019s written in a daily planner but as time goes on, the task visually fills up (indicating you\u2019re slowly out of time). For some it\u2019s an impending doom feeling may not work, for others it may keep them on task. That\u2019s just an example but using her strengths to tailor a reminder system is key. \n\nAnother aspect is also just doing too much and getting sidetracked causing for inevitable sabotage and failure of getting it all done. I\u2019d assess how she plans weekly/daily tasks and find ways to best optimize it. For example, if she were to go into the city, would going around lunch time (higher frequency to run into people) or earlier in the day where one is likely more productive be a better option? Or grouping tasks by location or routing a multi-stop trip for optimal distance/speed (instead of multiple back and forth trips) help manage her time better?  \n\nLastly, (maybe last resort because adults shouldn\u2019t need to have this imo but \u2026 read for the but\u2026) perhaps a reward system can be put in place. If she is a SAHM, it\u2019s likely she has running the household, cleaning up, managing service provider logistics, feeding/taking care of a child, meal prepping, etc. It\u2019s a lot. And I\u2019m assuming she isn\u2019t getting paid for it.

Your current dynamic sucks. The issues you have are valid, but damn, your current solution is a great way to breed resentment in your marriage.\n\nEdit: typo", "Are you asking her to do chores, or is she offering to?", "NTA - You need to update this post to say \u201cour\u201d errands. These are household errands. Not for you specifically.", "Yes. It is part of the whole deal. I call doctors, schedule repairmen, run errands, etc. Because my husband is at work.", "Right? It makes no sense. What could be possibly need done, every time she's there? There's a lot more going on than what's being said.", "I just simply don't believe one family has multiple errands each week needing both a car and a city centre to complete.", "Lol the 4pm text is the equivalent of the, \"oh shit mom's home in 30 min. Take the chicken out.\" \nNTA cause she should have grown out of that.", "On iPhone you can share notes.", "We use Notion for all our stuff, including our errands/grocery list. Shared tick boxes etc. plus it's also great for any other type of household admin and planning.", "[removed]", "Since when did everyone start using kiddo and kiddos ? It's so freaking annoying....please stop", "You will get downvoted for that, but I thought the same thing. \n\nForgets stuff and is unusually upset about critique.", "So basically even tho all the evidence points to her being the asshole you will choose to day he is because you don\u2019t believe the story", "I think you meant to ask OP.", "What do you mean when did everyone start using it? My dad has called me kiddo all my life and I'm 30. It's not some new thing", "So to answer the question asked.... She does not offer to shop for you, she's coming into the city to do her own thing. You are asking her to run errands for you on top of the plans she already has. She clearly tells you part of her plans, otherwise you wouldn't know she's coming into town to begin with. Based on some of your other replies it seems you two need to have a sit down and discuss what will work best. She doesn't want you to go into town by yourself on your days off, but it kind of sounds like you don't want to do that either. Maybe suggest going into town to run errands and also do something fun with the family together?", "Resentment is great for marriage", "I didn't consider the distance. Then NTA OP.", "Ahh thanks that makes sense. I'm not American and I don't drive so I didn't even consider that.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Yes but she's taking his car so he can't do the errands even on his lunch break. \n\nI honestly wonder if she doesn't trust him for some reason. Like I live over an hour from town and I can't imagine going in with my husband all the time and just what... wasting time all day? That would get old fast. I would have to have a really good reason to do that.... Just makes me think she's keeping an eye on him.", "Thank you.  I didn't read the comments, just the post.", "Haha I know\u2026 everyone\u2019s a psychologist these days \ud83d\ude02", "Given that the formally diagnosed rate of ADHD is about 1 in 20, yeah, probably \ud83e\udd37", "I\u2019m getting small town vibes from OP which probably means no public transit. I\u2019d want to access to a car if I was taking care of the kid every day.", "I meant go into town together on his days off with the family. Do the errands and go do something togetehr as a family as well. I saw one comment that he said if he goes into town to do errands he doesn't want to do anything except those errands then go back home to be with his family. but he could be with his family while doing errands and do something with them after errands are done, liek the zoo or something. \n\nAlso I live 30 minutes from where the majority of bigger shopping is. If my husband wants to run errands I go with him because I work a job like OP where i barely have time with him during my work week. so on my days off we spend time together, even if it was boring. It's not wasting time all day, it's working together. You don't HAVE to separate chores and errands, you can do them together also.", "lol none of us even know these people or what is really happening in their life."]}
