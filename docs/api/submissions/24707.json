I say this because while she an adult and needs to get stuff done, people are different and I\u2019m sure being a caretaker and everything else SAHM\u2019s do is a lot. \n\nIt comes down to how she prioritizes things. Sometimes it can be overwhelming and it takes a lot to run a household and manage peoples needs (hers, yours, child etc). Consider her strengths and how she organizes other aspects of her/your lives and draw on that. For example, if she\u2019s someone who has trouble staying in task, an app like structured is good. (No I didn\u2019t create it) but many people I know use it and from what I\u2019ve seen, you can customize when you get alerts, you can have it set up in your home page and each task is timed as though it\u2019s written in a daily planner but as time goes on, the task visually fills up (indicating you\u2019re slowly out of time). For some it\u2019s an impending doom feeling may not work, for others it may keep them on task. That\u2019s just an example but using her strengths to tailor a reminder system is key. \n\nAnother aspect is also just doing too much and getting sidetracked causing for inevitable sabotage and failure of getting it all done. I\u2019d assess how she plans weekly/daily tasks and find ways to best optimize it. For example, if she were to go into the city, would going around lunch time (higher frequency to run into people) or earlier in the day where one is likely more productive be a better option? Or grouping tasks by location or routing a multi-stop trip for optimal distance/speed (instead of multiple back and forth trips) help manage her time better?  \n\nLastly, (maybe last resort because adults shouldn\u2019t need to have this imo but \u2026 read for the but\u2026) perhaps a reward system can be put in place. If she is a SAHM, it\u2019s likely she has running the household, cleaning up, managing service provider logistics, feeding/taking care of a child, meal prepping, etc. It\u2019s a lot. And I\u2019m assuming she isn\u2019t getting paid for it.

Imagine a big horizontal whiteboard.  You also have postit notes and pens.\n\nUse a pen to divide the board in quarters vertically. Label them: backlog | ready | doing | done.\n\nNow write stuff you need to get done on your postit notes. These are your work items. If something is too complex for one note, break it down into smaller tasks. Place your notes into the backlog column on your board, keeping more urgent items towards the top.\n\nLet's say we're going to review again in one week. So move the items you're going to do in that week, into the \"ready\" column. Leave everything else in backlog.\n\nPick your first item and move only that one into the \"doing\" column. Do it! Once done, move it all the way right into the \"done\" column.\n\nYou can have more than one item in \"doing\" but a key to success is limiting \"work in progress \".\n\n So if the kanban is yours alone, limit yourself to 2 items in that column at once. Realistically,  if there's more than 2, you're not really doing them all!! So move something back into \"ready\". \n\nIf you're sharing your work with others, you can decide your \"work in progress \" limit together.  \n\nThe benefits are great when sharing work because you can easily see where things are up to, offering support, kudos, encouragement etc. You can have a quick chat daily to see if there's anything blocking progress and if so, concentrate on removing the \"blocker\" before moving onto anything else.\n\nIt feels great seeing everything moving across into \"done\".\n\nAt the end of the week, have 2 short sessions.  1) a quick retrospective to see whether everything got done, what went well, what you learned etc. Decide actions and apply them to next week.\n\n2) have a quick planning session to decide the next week's,work and move it into the \"ready\" column. \n\n...and you're ready for the next week!\n\nOf course there are lots of refinements you can make like...    \n- You can denote related work items using certain colours or drawing horizontal  \"swimlanes\" on the board.    \n- Adjust your cadence, e.g. fortnightly might work better for you than weekly    \n- Decide what and how items are written and added to the board    \n- Draw a graph to show progress     \n- Assign \"sizes\" to your work items     \n- Add due dates    \n- move to an electronic version like Trello if that's more convenient     \n\nOK links...\n\nhttps://kanbantool.com/kanban-board    \nhttps://parentlightly.com/kanban-for-home/#:~:text=At%20its%20simplest%2C%20a%20Kanban,move%20it%20to%20%E2%80%9CDone%E2%80%9D.    \nhttps://www.scrum.org/resources/kanban-guide-scrum-teams    \nhttps://trello.com/tour    \nhttps://kissflow.com/project/agile/kanban-methodology/", "It's a very broad methodology with lots of options and frameworks to choose from.

If she doesn\u2019t want constant reminders / follow-up from OP, she needs a better system to get stuff done. That said, it kinda sounds like she\u2019s not trying to do his errands or prioritizing what he\u2019s asking for. Like, she\u2019s often getting caught up with talking to friends? Maybe there\u2019s a larger conversation to be had around what she thinks is reasonable of him to ask of her. I handle ALL of the errands for our home, usually without complaint\u2026but occasionally I do get irritated when my husband asks me to call in his prescription. Like, \ud83e\udd28you\u2019re an adult, you can call it in. Just ask me to pick it up when I\u2019m out and about and it\u2019s ready. I feel like sometimes you need to check with each other about what is reasonable to take care of for each other and what the boundaries are.", "NTA. I recommend downloading the app Habit.

Or if they skipped it.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m a stay at home wife. And I will admit I have forgotten a few things. And my husband points it out. So the Habit App helps me remover what I need to do.", "NTA.\n\nIt's obviously helping.\n\nIt's easy to miss how much something helps you when you have it. You're running into no problems after all!

We absolutely run errands as a family on the weekend. There's no other time to do it.", "Would it be feasible to get a cheap runaround for her to use?

I think it\u2019s hilarious! It\u2019s not childish or anything, he just knows his weak spots and as a sensible adult can admit it! He would rather get in and out and get what\u2019s needed without roaming aisles or having to call me again.", "Household full of neurospicy people. We ALL do this. For anything.

This is the only comment I saw from OP about what the errands are (the question was whether the errands were for him and his hobbies or stuff for the house):\n\n> Stuff for the house.

The shop delivers but I need her to verify that it is the one we need because there are a bunch of different ones.  So I will give her the old one and that way she can see that everything is the same.
