If you feel that actions like these are being taken by this church, then you should look up local laws & procedures to see what can be done about it.

For months they have been tipping with those stupid fake $20 and $50 bills that talk about how you only need god. She has tried to complain to management but they won\u2019t do anything. I searched every church\u2019s website in the area and finally found them. My friend and her coworkers have been saving the bills for a while so I took them and brought them to the church. I went to church the next Sunday, and when the collection basket came around, I dumped my wallet out and passed it down. At the end of the service, I stuck around for a bit when the priest stormed out of his office area and yelled \u201cwhat kind of sick joke is this?! Who the hell did this?!\u201d He threw the fake money on the ground and stormed back into his office. The entire church was silent, and some people where giving me the side eye. I mentioned it to my parents and they got very very angry at me. I feel bad now bc the priest had tears in his eyes, but they have also been doing this for a long time. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe they'll realize how well their \"tips\" have been received.", "NTA, love it", "NTA, but I don\u2019t know if you really did anything to change the situation. It\u2019s a good prank in the moment, but frankly, I think it would be better if you also included a note, letting them know where these bills came from.", "NTA at all. Does the pastor/priest know what his congregation is doing?  That would\u2019ve been a good moment to call them out. Why are your parents angry?\n\nReally it would be great to leave a review of them too including how they screw over local severs", "NTA and I find it hilarious! If they think their money is good enough as a tip for a service, it should be good enough as a church donation too.", "Christian here and I say NTA!\n\n Everybody knows that tips are an important part of a servers income. \n\nIt's one thing to witness to people if you can do so without being pushy. But quite another thing to Bandy about what a great Christian you are while  hurting the very people you are proselytizing\n\nIt was one of the most clueless, shortsighted and on Christ like things a Christian can do\n\nI'm going to pray right now that that stupid Minister and his cronies got a wake up call. I hope they actually learned a lesson from this taste of their own medicine\n\n\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude21\n\nGood on you, OP!", "NTA.
