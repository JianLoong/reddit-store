I\u2019m so tired of men just\u2026 not realizing the obvious because of the preoccupation with their own desire to sexualize women every chance they can. She\u2019s a PERSON.", "He\u2019s mad at her for reaching out to anyone she felt like she could for support, because his own actions made him look bad.", "Thing is, he read the room really wrong. She had told him she was self conscious for now. Do I think he did it to be cruel no. Did it make her feel worse? Yes. Maybe she just feels bad about her body changes, or whatever. Stating the obvious can still make someone feel bad.", ">How's he an AH for making the (IMO very obvious) observation that a breastfeeding woman's boobs are larger than before?\n\nBy saying it out loud. Observations about other peoples bodies are usually best left unsaid", "His mother asked a question and it was answered. READ ffs", "It wasn\u2019t innocuous to OP in that moment in her extra vulnerable state, which is what matters", "[removed]", "Did that one strike you sideways? Hit dogs holler.", "She\u2019s trying to rationalize his comment because he made her feel like shit for not being sooo appreciative of it.", "Stop. Stop shaming OP for upholding her own boundaries while SHE breastfeeds, SHE is 3 weeks postpartum. Stop shaming her for not sacrificing even more of herself for her husband\u2019s experience. He can bond and parent of his own volition if he can get over himself enough to actually support his wife.", "LMAO seriously? You're really looking to get offended \ud83e\udd23. Did he lie? He made a statement and she way over reacted.", "Where are you reading \"compliment?\"", "I don't know who said anything about a compliment?", "It\u2019s not inherently sexualising.\n\nWhile I was breastfeeding, my husband wasn\u2019t all into the boobs because it\u2019s weird. But he and I both made comments about how big my boobs were. Hell, when my milk came in with my second, it was like they went from being bigger to BAM giant and rock fucking hard (it came in really suddenly and they were both so swollen it took 10 minutes of pumping on each one before they were \u201cdeflated\u201d enough for our son to attach) and I was like BABE WHAT THE FUCK and he responded with WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THEM?! \n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying OP is wrong for feeling how she\u2019s feeling. Because yeah, 7 years after my first, 5 1/2 years after my second, I\u2019m still not okay with the lasting changes to my body. Her insecurity is valid. She\u2019s allowed to be uncomfortable in her own skin after her body has massively changed and may or may not ever return to what it was.\n\nI\u2019m merely saying referencing your breastfeeding SO\u2019s boobs/their size increase during breast feeding, or just in general when not actively breast feeding, often isn\u2019t sexual.\n\nNow, if there\u2019s a comment from OP somewhere that actually demonstrates that he was sexualising them, sure. But with what\u2019s in the post, there\u2019s nothing to imply sexualisation.", "Simply noting that her breasts are larger =/= sexualizing.", "Where does it say she asked a question, calm yourself down.", "But it wasn\u2019t that moment. She said it happened a few days ago and she told his parents recently. She also recognises that it was a malicious comment and just an observational one. So if you\u2019re able to have the emotional intelligence to recognise that the comment wasn\u2019t malicious, why do you need to involve a third party after the fact?", "Of course they CAN be. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that this specific one is. It seems like you\u2019re making assumptions and reaching a bit.", "**It\u2019s also a fact that the man in this case was not \u201cbeing a pig\u201d but was making an observation,** u/madys0n and u/Bulky-District-2757, if you read OP\u2019s post.", "You're quite the misandrist. It's not a good look.\n\nYes, men can be awful. Women can be awful. Humans can be awful.\n\nBut you have some serious issues when you turn normal conflict into some men are trash vendetta. I suggest therapy.", "And because it\u2019s probably devastating to have to admit to yourself, in the throes of postpartum breastfeeding discomfort, that the man you chose to partner with and procreate with is not actually able to be a true partner in the way you deserve, and he can\u2019t meet you on your level, you can\u2019t even count on him to be there for you let alone not selfishly sexualize you while you\u2019re so vulnerable and overwhelmed. It\u2019s just take take take from the female body. Dehumanizing.", "Reading must be difficult for you. Not his wife, and he wasn't shaming her, he was making an observation and SHE HERSELF said there was no malice in it.  \n\n\nShe kicks him out which he leaves and then his mother gets involved! I mean how old is she? Something tells me she'll be single again real soon.", "\"You're really looking to get offended\"\n\n...What are you on about?\n\n\"Did he lie? He made a statement and she way over reacted.\"\n\nThe fact that you pulled the \"did he lie\" card is hilarious lmao. obviously he didn't lie genius, They HAVE gotten bigger, She KNOWS that they've gotten bigger, so why exactly is he stating the fvcking obvious? she doesn't need anyone to tell her that.\n\nLike i said before, he shouldn't be making \"statements\" about her body especially after she has just given birth and is bleeding and hormonal. End of story. Also, you are in no position to tell any one how to react to something they do not consider a \"compliment\".", "Hilarious all the downvotes you're getting when pointing out the truth. Her vague answers says all we need to know that she's the cause for him calling off the engagement for whatever reason. Otherwise like most do around here they would drag their SO through the mud if the SO were the offender.", "He \u201c keeps insisting I\u2019m making a big deal out of nothing because it was a compliment since he likes my boobs.\u201d", "It still doesn\u2019t need to be said out loud.", "Who said anything about sexualising anything?", "The post is not that long. again i say, read. i am not pinpointing anything for you. \n\nAlso, i am fairly calm, thanks :)", "OP said that her in laws assumed it was so he could keep him company.
