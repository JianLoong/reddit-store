He knows you're feeling insecure and it's best not to make any comments on that situation. I love big boobies too, but that's not really relevant when it comes to how that's gonna make you feel.

I\u2019ve got three kids and the youngest is 7 months old. She is now starting solid foods but was exclusively breastfed, as were my two older kiddos. Those initial weeks postpartum are absolutely insane. I thought being pregnant was crazy for feeling hormonal. Nope. It had nothing on being postpartum and breastfeeding. Thank God it calms down but know that even though you might be more sensitive than you would be if you weren\u2019t postpartum, your feelings are still valid and you can ask people to back off or not say certain things right now; it is okay to tell other people no or that they\u2019re being hurtful even if they think they aren\u2019t regardless of any other circumstances.

He gave you a compliment, (you said so yourself) but you aren't in the headspace to take it that way. It's not a big deal. All of us guys who have kids have made the same \"mistake\".

Remembering the size of mine while breast feeding it is quite a noticeable change. If he didn\u2019t say this in a derogatory manner, I think YTA. Why are you self conscious? If your baby is 3 weeks old your body has just started to go back to normal. My gosh you seem very insecure. Be happy your baby is nursing well and rejoice in this is a totally natural way to have fat cells leave your body- they never leave when you just lose weight, they shrink.

It seems like you're way too sensitive about more than just one thing, and he probably is walking on eggshells around you constantly. I don't think you can blame pregnancy hormones on this one.\n\nAnd you told his mommy on him? That's a huge red flag in a relationship. I would absolutely never tell tell my husband's mom if he did or said something that I found slightly offensive just so he could get yelled at. That's just bizarre", "NTA and good for his mom for sticking for you!", "NTA", "YTA. Grow up.", "NTA.
