And y'all need to remember 1 thing HES A FUCKING MAN!! They are so clueless sometimes. He's obviously nervous..they broke up now back together and a baby on top. So they have to figure that all out. He most likely blurted out first thing that came to his mind. He shouldn't of said it. But she is so messed up with hormones all over the place she overreacted some.

Never be afraid to state your boundaries--but at the same time, don't be shocked if he never knew you felt that way-- nobody can read your mind, after all. I would suggest having a honest and serious discussion about your body insecurities, it could be a learning moment for you both!", "You're entitled to feel as you do, but imo he isn't wrong or bad either.  Perfectly normal thing to say honestly....they do get bigger....if u feel that uncomfortable with your partner that he cant say something like this...enough to throw him out...you may be insecure in more then your body right now...its the relationship perhaps?  In a healthy or loving relationship this wouldn't typically trigger.  Even after birth, with hormones raging or ppd...its a very strong reaction.

Was so interesting to us watching what my body did. \n\nI can see that if your relationship was tense or mum was tired or hormonal (the early days are wild) or just plain stressed that she could take his comment the wrong way.
