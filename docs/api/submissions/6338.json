They have to treat their relationship as new again, at least in this context. The bottom line is that he has every right to be a part of his baby's life, but the baby's mom is absolutely not comfortable with the level of intimacy he's trying to return to. \"Two yes, one no\" policy for stuff like this, so her \"no\" has to win out here.\n\nHis parents being involved is such a grey area, though.
