{"id": 29620, "submission_id": "17fr0eg", "title": "WIBTA if I traveled to Wales by myself despite my parents' objections?", "selftext": "I, 22F, have wanted to visit Wales for years ever since I saw it on Torchwood.  I've just finished up a season of trail work, I have decent savings, and I'm unlikely to be able to find a job in my field too quickly.  Also, I still live at home, and likely will for a while as job hunting sucks right now and I'm in the stage where I expect to apply to like at least 50 jobs. One thing about my family is that my mom has an anxiety disorder that wasn't treated at all until a few years ago. My dad just enables her.\n\nSome of it I kind of understand, like her not wanting me to go to the movies by myself at night, but then she also stopped me from going to prom because I didn't have a date, refused to let me go on my first date (I was 20. She physically stopped me from leaving.) She also thought I was going to develop a serious psychiatric disorder that her brother has. My therapist had to tell her to stop accusing me of having this, because I have shown no signs of it and the constant accusations and controlling my behavior was causing me serious anxiety. \n\nI told my parents a few days ago that I was planning on going  to Wales. They asked if I was going by myself. I said yes. I can afford this trip. Obviously it would be \"better\" financially if I just saved my money and didn't do anything but I refuse to live my life like that. I had a very stressful few months and I deserve a vacation. My parents are concerned that I can't afford it. They could start charging me rent so I have no savings, but I highly doubt that would happen since they are genuinely worried about me. My mom also told me that I don't deserve/need a vacation and I just need to get used to being an adult and working all the time.\n\nThey are also concerned that I'm going to miss a family birthday party. I have told my mom about 30 times that there is no way I am missing it but she keeps claiming that I said I would (?). \n\nI asked my brother at dinner if he would be willing to drive me to the airport and she completely blew up. Telling me I can't buy a ticket or anything without asking her first and I don't get to just leave without permission. Later I ran into her while I was grabbing my laundry and she said \"I'm really unhappy right now.\" Which I ignored, because I have nothing productive to add to that. She then stood in front of me to stop me from leaving and freaked out about said birthday party again and started yelling at me saying I can't just leave and she thought it was a terrible idea. I refuse to yell back at her anymore so I just left. She asked me why I didn't answer and I said I had nothing to say right now, and she started yelling at me again. The thing is, I would consider a vacation closer to home (I'm American) but I literally can't do anything without her freaking out and being horribly anxious and yelling at me. This has stunted my social development literally my entire life and I can't put up with it anymore. I have so many regrets and I don't want this to be another one.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1698190886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fr0eg/wibta_if_i_traveled_to_wales_by_myself_despite_my/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Use the money to become independent, then take your Welsh vacation.  You\u2019re NTA for wanting to take this trip solo, but YTA for doing it when there are more pressing needs.", "NTA you will regret it if you don\u2019t. I lived in Wales for a year and studied where they film Doctor Who and it was the best time of my life.", "NTA. They cannot stop you from going.", "I went to Wales when I was 21 and it was amazing.", "Probably best to try to save money to move out of the house because your mom seems very controlling. Your mental health will be better when you leave home.\n\nBut going to travel may relieve some of your stress but you can see it as a small experiment of standing on you own two feet.\n\nI travelled to London, Cardiff, and several other locations in Great Britain. I did the whole Doctor Who/Torchwood thing so you will be pretty safe in London and Cardiff. The whole thing was mildly underwhelming but I don\u2019t regret a day of my life for going to Canary Wharf in London or trying to find Torchwood in Cardiff.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if there is a direct flight to Cardiff but at worst you will fly to London and travel between both cities by railroad. You probably won\u2019t need more than maybe 2 to 3 nights at Cardiff, probably 2 nights if you\u2019re traveling by rail and time of departure for the trains.\n\nTry to set up an international plan on your cellphone. It will be expensive but it will be possible less anxiety producing for you instead of getting an SIM card for the UK. You will be able to text home or reverse.\n\nI would not recommend trying to plan things on your own if you never planned a vacation before. If you have an Auto Club Membership you can go use the travel agency and have someone hold your hand.

The rent free arrangement is pretty convenient, but how\u2019s your freedom working out?\n\nNot so well obviously. \n\nUse your decent savings towards getting your own place.

If your mom physically kept you from leaving the home once before, she will do it again. And taking your passport from you will stop you from leaving the country. \n\nIf you have a family member or friend nearby, you could stash your paperwork and passport there. Maybe stash your suitcases there as well before you leave. I'm pretty sure just the sight of you prepping your holiday like packing will set off your mom, so try and do that somewhere else.\n\nThe truth is, this won't end until you move out and put some distance between you.
