If it\u2019s at all affordable for you, I suggest finding a gay-friendly therapist to work through the trauma of living in that environment with. \nAlso, queerness and homophobia do some funny things to your sense of time. I could only really have hookups and casual things when I lived at home even as some straight friends were moving in together and getting married. When I moved out I had to learn how to be in a relationship at an accelerated pace, which is something many straight people have much longer to figure out.

You don't need to feel guilty for that. Come out when you are ready, and not a moment before. \n\nAs for your mother, she may have her hysterics and then come to her senses. She also might never accept you. If she doesn't accept you, then that's on her. As you said, nothing has to change unless she changes it. You are still her kid, you still love her. Her reaction to your orientation doesn't change that. So any breaking of your relationship is on her.
