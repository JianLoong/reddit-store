Getting out of your home (and out from under the feet of your homophobic mother) will be good for you.\n\nI have no idea what you want to do with your social life - whether you're looking to meet Mr. Right, or whether you're looking for a whole bunch of casual hookups. I'd offer two bits of advice - if you are in the market for casual hookups, make sure it's what you actually want, and not some reaction to your new-found freedom, and make sure you're being safe (in all senses of the word) about it.\n\nOtherwise, just move in to your new home and get on with life.

If their relationship is on the outs too, you can't worry too much right now about how they handle your sexuality. Move out, be fully gay and happy, and let them come around when they do--because they will!

Start by opening up to your dad if you think that would go well. Go slowly, don't rush. If you have your dad's support it'll help you move on to your mum. A friend had a similar situation with the parents reversed. The dad said he'd disown him for being gay but as time went by and he got used to his son being who he is, the dad came around. I don't think he loves his son being gay, but he loves his son. Also, therapy helped.

It's your mother. So being out of home is going to do you a world of good.\n\nShe has no right to dictate how you live but when you are out from under her roof there is no reason you need to discuss your lifestyle with her. Unless you want to.\n\nWhat will do you the world of good is connecting to other gay people. So get out there and meet people. Meet gay people and meet straight people and make friends. You need good, supportive friends who don't give a 5hit who you are attracted to. \n\nSo - this move is going to be positive. This move will allow you to expand your horizons. This move will remove you from toxicity. This move is a new start. \n\nYou are great just as you are, even if your mother has a hang-up. Being gay does not make you bad. It is one aspect of who you are. But it's important and you are allowed to be you. \n\nYou can say whatever you want to your mother. You can cut her off if you need to.

There's a bunch of strangers on Reddit rooting for you.", "NTA, you did try, and they responded badly, it's natural to not want to do it again.", "NTA. Being removed from your mother's homophobia is a good thing. You must not set yourself in fire for her comfort.", "NTA you have been doing what you had to in order to be safe. If it\u2019s at all affordable for you, I suggest finding a gay-friendly therapist to work through the trauma of living in that environment with. \nAlso, queerness and homophobia do some funny things to your sense of time. I could only really have hookups and casual things when I lived at home even as some straight friends were moving in together and getting married. When I moved out I had to learn how to be in a relationship at an accelerated pace, which is something many straight people have much longer to figure out. This meant I was in some quite unhealthy relationships and felt like I didn\u2019t deserve better because I\u2019d internalised my parents\u2019 homophobia.

It went a lot better than I expected, but it could have been worse. The lie you told was to keep yourself safe and keep a roof over your head until you could afford to do it for yourself. You don't need to feel guilty for that. Come out when you are ready, and not a moment before. \n\nAs for your mother, she may have her hysterics and then come to her senses. She also might never accept you. If she doesn't accept you, then that's on her. As you said, nothing has to change unless she changes it. You are still her kid, you still love her. Her reaction to your orientation doesn't change that. So any breaking of your relationship is on her. I hope she accepts you, but if she doesn't then that's on her and her alone.", "NTA I hope they come around and accept you for who you are and you get to live the life you deserve. I always use the line \"the truth will set you free\", is there any way there could be mediation with a counsellor to maybe help her cop the fuck on.", "Your mother is the one fully in the wrong here. If she cuts ties, that is her loss and not yours. You need her to either get her shit tigether or to get out of your life and let you live it. It looks like your dad is reasonable but he's an AH for not standing up for you more vocally. Go be happy, OP. Don't let your parents drag you down.", "NTA. you don't owe them a coming out. it's only up to you when you tell people, or if you want to tell them at all! obviously it is unsafe to tell your mother, and you're doing what you have to do to survive in her presence. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA and have you considered that your parents might be having issues due to how your mom behaves towards you? It isn't right, and a parent worth their shit will not stand for the demonizing of their child. Stop focusing on them and live your life, this is way to long to suffer for soneone else's crappy beliefs.", "NTA,  but your mom certainly is. Ignore the homophobe; your better of without her. Go live your life and enjoy it! That said, it sounds like your mom has done a horrible number on your mental health, and I would strongly recommend therapy if you're not already in it.", "But if you DID become a floor show at your local gay night spot\u2026 that would be pretty cool too.", "he seems pretty honnest with himself, and he certainly doesn't owe a coming-out to his family.
