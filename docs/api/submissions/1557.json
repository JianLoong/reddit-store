They\u2019re easy to put in temporarily; lots of folks in my family already had them to keep dogs out of certain areas during family gatherings so when kids started showing up they\u2019d use them to keep babies and dogs in separate parts of the house unless under close supervision etc. It\u2019s not hard to throw a baby-gate in the back of your car and bring it to thanksgiving to block off the stairs. It\u2019s an extremely temporary installation, easy as pie, and you just move the breakable things (or the \u2018things that you will be stressed that little hands are grabbing\u2019) out of reach.\n\nBut, that only works if the parents involved WANT to watch their children and corral them.

It's about *them likely hurting OP's pets*. \n\nPlus, while OP says she's worried about the birds... I'd be worried about the kids.

Not necessary, but small kids can be quick so better safe than sorry.\n\n Do NOT let them in with your parots. When my little one was 2 she was petting a cat, I was sitting right next to her paying close attention, she still managed to pull the cats tail. We berated her immediately and did not let her pet the cat until she was older after that. But it still happened even with our full attention on her. I don't want to imagine what would happen to your poor parrots with kids with them unsupervised. \n\nRegarding a baby gate: how easily accessible are the stairs? Is there a door between the kids and the stairs? Is there a possibility to just completely block them with a piece of furniture for the day? Kids can be really quick and it can be extremely stressful as a parent if my kid could easily fall of a stairs. \n\nThen again I would probably just not come if it would be dangerous for my child. I usually don't expect people to child proof their house for my kids, I just meet with them in a different place if the house is not child proof to the point of potentially being dangerous (think open staircase downstairs in the middle of the living room) or with an almost guarantee that my kids could break something (think glass figurines all over the place where kids can easily touch it and potentially break it). You shouldn't have to child proof your home, but a consequence could be that parents of young kids don't feel comfortable visiting. \n\nMost of my child free friends sort of child proof their home when I come with my kids (most of the breakable stuff out of easy reach, furniture they own anyway in front of dangerous staircases) and I pay extra attention to my kids so they don't break the things that do remain within reach. I can't be everywhere at once, my kids know the rules but they are also small and have poor impulse control. They havent broken anything yet and are usually quite careful. Some of my child free friends have actually bought a baby gate, which was hugely appreciated since it does take stress of me, but wasn't necessary. \n\nIf my friends don't want to child proof their house (which is completely fine) I either try to meet with them without the kids or I meet with them in a child proof public place like a park or something, or at my home which is my preffered place since I don't have to pay as much attention to them there since it's child proof and safe. \n\nYou are nta for not wanting to child proof your home, but I sort of understand the parents wanting it at least a little child proofed. But then again it's their choice to want to do it at your place and they don't get to make demands to how child proof their home is.", "NTA \n\nI would go ahead and cancel it.

Let me be clear that it's *not* supposed to substitute actual parenting in any way - it's literally just a marketing tactic to get parents in the door.  \nWe had to stop doing it during covid19, because it was a health hazard, and you would not believe how many of these parents *lost their minds* because they were completely relying on it to keep their kids quiet. Like they had no plan for how they were going to parent their kids without it. We had walk-outs over this shit.\n\nI actually didn't want to bring it back *ever*, because of that (a battle I sadly lost). Because it *is* extra effort we have to go to for every single customer, and the only thanks we got was grown adults throwing tantrums and storming out when we literally *couldn't* do it because there was a chance it could get someone sick.\n\nFor the record, the *kids* never threw tantrums about it. It was all the parents. I actually vividly remember one kid being really irritated at his mum, because she kept making him ask about it over and over to try and emotionally manipulate us into doing it anyway.

Nope. Canceling now is far better for everyone in the end.

It is *never* the responsibility of a host, family or not, to modify their home for children. Parents have to watch their kids, even at the home of a family member.\n\nIt would be reasonable and helpful for you to do things like move fragile or dangerous objects out of reach for the occasion. Of course you should fully secure anything truly dangerous (e.g. weapons, drugs) but you would likely want to do that for guests of any age. But parents who bring their children to another home are responsible for supervising them, which means watching much more closely than at home on familiar territory.\n\nEven the most childproof house can have unexpected hazards that parents discover approximately 5 seconds after the baby does. It's a bit of an arms race. It's insane to expect that a childless home can simply be made safe for your child.\n\nKids go all kinds of places without baby gates where they don't fall down stairs because they are being closely supervised by a parent. They fall down stairs when the parents are not right there watching them closely. Your family certainly could *ask* if they could bring *their* baby gate (the hardware-free kind) and put it on your stairs for the occasion. \n\nBut demanding to be allowed into the parrott room because it will keep the kids quiet is \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 that is wrong on so many levels. That combined with their general demands makes it clear they will be terrible guests.\n\nThe subtext of their demands is that they want to not have to watch their kids closely and think they are entitled to this just because it is the home of a family member. They are not entitled to this. \n\nLet your family know that you are sorry your home is not suitable for their needs and you will no longer be able to host the holiday.

From the time she could walk, she was taught that she does not go up or down the stairs without an adult. When she visits, we're downstairs - that's where the family meets. Upstairs is our private area - offices, bedroom, etc. The same is true about our basement - it's a private area, because it can't be made \"child safe\" (it's our workshop with a lot of power tools and other sharp objects). \n\nLast week, our granddaughter was staying with us, so she was sleeping upstairs in our bedroom. She knows that she stays upstairs until we accompany her down the stairs. She's very careful - she walks down the stairs slowly, holding the handrail.
