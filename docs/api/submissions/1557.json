NTA", "NTA - BUT I would strongly recommend you get a stairgate anyway. If they are all drinking and chatting there is no way they will be keeping an eye on their kids 100%. It will keep them away from your parrots, your bedroom, everything you don\u2019t want them touching. Even with your parrot door locked they could bang on the other side of it, or run up and down the hall yelling. (Your parrots are going to be a magnet for them). And you can put anything valuable out of the way. You shouldn\u2019t have to, but I promise you it\u2019s a worthwhile investment to protect your stuff. And if you don\u2019t think so, read back through some of these AITA posts where kids have damaged peoples stuff and parents haven\u2019t paid up.", "NTA, I would refuse to host, full stop.", "Absolutely NTA as a mother of a 3 yr old i don't make any demands about other people's houses and if I go over with her I keep her entertained and keep an eye on her and teach her not to get into stuff she's not supposed to. It would be ridiculous of me to expect other people who do not have kids to child proof their homes for my sake.", "NTA. OP after they said the kids should be allowed to **play with the parrots**, I would have canceled Thanksgiving at your place right then.  Your ground rules are more than justified and no need to to bend or change them.", "NTA - you can\u2019t host. Even  if they magically agree with you, they\u2019re not going to watch their kids and they will 100% be in that parrot room. Just cancel it now.", "NTA. Do not, under any circumstances, allow children into the parrot room. The birds need a place to be where they are safe and unbothered. Children should not be playing with them at all. If they want to see the birds, choose one of your best behaved and least likely to be stressed birds, and arrange the kids in the quiet room. Be sure to stipulate there's no touching of the birds (they can get hurt or sick easily), and they have to be calm and respectful (so the bird isn't stressed out). It's normal they'll want to see the birds, but you should introduce them in a controlled atmosphere. If anything happens to that atmosphere,  tell them the bird has to go back to its room, and take it back there. Of course you don't have to let them see the bird, but it might be easier to just show one or two while they're all sitting quietly. Do it after dinner so it can be a reward for good behaviour. Full children are usually a little quieter than hungry ones, too. \n\nIf they want you to child proof the stairs, ask one of them to bring a baby gate or something. One with no screws so it doesn't damage walls. Surely one of them has one. It shouldn't be your responsibility to child proof your home. I have had lots of kids in my not-proofed home and never had a problem. The most baby proofing I do is hiding my Xbox remotes because I don't want them broken.", "Right? It's not hard. I never had to even ask my sister to bring one. Just had to answer the \"how wide is the stairway in your house\" text.", "Ha! Yes\u2026 the ultimate child proofing is to tell them to celebrate elsewhere.", "Thing is this is more than 4 kids, OP is already doing more than enough by allowing many people to come over and to cater to every single one of their kids needs? The parents are responsible for their children. Including entertainment", "Literally. We have a bachelor friend who loves our kids and comes over to our house often. He has no problem with us going to his apartment but we don't go much because it's obviously not childproofed and I would never ask him to do that to his own space. I just watch them the best I can and when it gets too rowdy we head home.", "Exactly what I was thinking. They want a hands-off chance to chill and socialize. That's why that wanted to let the kids entertain themselves with OP's poor pets. I'd cancel if it were me. OP will spend the whole day stressed out. And, for sure lock that door if they wind up hosting. The parents have no intention of setting and enforcing boundaries with their kids.", "This. I'd cancel it if I were you. I have a funny feeling that the day of they won't watch their kids, they will figure out how to open the door to the parrot room and let their kids terrorize the parrots and claim its all for the enjoyment and entertainment of the kids because the kids were bored and they neglected to bring entertainment.", "Parront \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "My sister had a travel baby gate that she just always brought with her. Suuuuper simple solution. You put the babies on the ground floor with some toys and books and block the stairs with your gate.", "Parrot date night", "I said OP and I were different people, nothing else.", "They really are flying toddlers", "That's a great idea! Thank you. I'm going to get one.", "Hell yeah, brother"]}
