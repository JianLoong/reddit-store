Especially his daughter. I love them because they're family but I don't like them. His daughter is mean, bossy, and a flat out bully that always torments her siblings and my brother doesn't do anything to stop it because she is the golden child.\n\nAnd his son for the most part is fine but he can act out and be mean too, often calling me names or kicking my seat while I'm driving and when I get upset and try to get him to stop my brother gets mad at me.\n\nToday tho was a day where everyone was running late, me included, and he wanted me to run him to work, but that was impossible without making me late to my own job. He then goes on a long rant about how he doesn't have help, nobody cares about his kids or wants to help him, etc etc etc.\n\nHe doesn't appreciate anything and no matter what you do it's never enough he always wants more and I'm exhausted all the time because I work a very demanding job that is long hours and I don't want to do the extra running with his kids anymore because of how unappreciative and ungrateful he is with his constant demands for more.\n\nBut I know that if I stop giving them a ride, the kids will have no way to get to school because my brother doesn't have a care or a license.\n\nSo wibta if I stop giving them a ride?\n\n\nTldr: I don't want to give my brother's kids a ride to school everyday because he doesn't appreciate it and always demands more, but if I stop he has no way to get them to school.", "created_utc": 1695904389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16uet41/aita_if_i_stop_taking_my_brothers_kids_to_school/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's one thing to ask for it exceptionally, but quite another to become their private chauffeur. When they were late, you should have left on time without them.\n\nOn top of that, your brother is ungrateful and his children behave badly : focus on your kid and let him deal with his own. It's his responsibility.", "You know why there are so many deadbeat dads? Because there is always some woman who will step in to help.\n\nLet him figure this out. He's a grown up human. He can manage, like literally Billions of single parents before him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - Obviously your brother only sees you as an Uber, except he doesn't feel he has to pay.  You need to set down a hard boundary of this attitude.  His whining about nobody wants to help him maybe be due this (ya think).  If you decide to keep driving him and his kids around, sans payment there are some rules he and kids have to follow.  First, can't be late, second, the kids better damn well behave themselves and quit being brats.  The first offense will result in you killing the whole deal.  If he can't deal with the rules then he can find another to get him and his kids around, you're done.  Him and his kids transportation is a him problem, not a you problem.  When he starts whining, put in ear plugs and just smile at him.  You don't need this shit and you are no longer going to put up with it.", "Info: where are you living that doesn\u2019t offer school buses?", "NTA. \nI had to do the same thing with my (24f) sister (33f). She would always ask me to pick my niece and nephew up from daycare when I got my 2 kids. And then would expect me to drive them 30min home when she got off work but I live in another town. Once I stopped helping I became the bad guy. But I will tell you, the stress that has left me since I don\u2019t have her kids is amazing!! Her kids are 2f and 4m, mine are 11months f & 3f. Her children are so mean to my kids yet when I correct them I\u2019m the bad guy. It wasn\u2019t worth it anymore. My oldest became abusive because that\u2019s how my sisters kids acted and once that happened I was DONE.", "NTA. Your brother is within walking distance of the school so he's just going to have to wake up early enough to walk his kids to school, drop them off and then get himself to work. Or maybe he can arrange for someone else who lives near him to get his kids in on a carpool. His problem. I'd argue that you'd be doing him a favor because right now it seems his bad behavior is just being enabled.", "NTA. Tell him it's affecting your work and you can't afford to be late or you'll lose your job. Only way you'll continue is if attitudes and punctuality changes and they have a week to get it togther (still more than I would offer though). You've done more than enough and if they were well behaved/appreciative I doubt you'd even consider stopping. You have more patience than me.", "NTA \n\nOf course, you realize now your mistake was starting this at all.\n\nBut what's done is done.\n\nNow, it's time to give your brother a two week notice that you will not be driving his kids OR him anywhere unless it is an absolutely emergency.\n\nObservation:  There is no law that you have to love your niece.  It always amazes me that people think they are required to love someone simply because they're related.  You niece sounds distinctly unlovable.", "NTA. Your brother in his 37 has to learn how to be independent and grateful for any help. He is useless and demanding instead. Since he lives too close to school, than he has to walk his kids there with benefit of morning walk for everyone. You have your own life and responsibilities, so I'd concentrate on them.", "NTA and if your brother refuses to take his kids to school, call child protective services or the equivalent in your area. You don't have to ruin your day for his kids.", "NTA, and how is it your problem he has no car or license? You are enabling his bad behavior and his kids. Stop doing it!", "NTA \n\nHis kids his responsibility \n\nHas he even offered to chip in for gas? \n\nSo ungrateful to complain about not getting help to the person helping him \n\nTough luck pal - he just drove his last helper away", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t do favours for ungrateful people. It\u2019s his fault he couldn\u2019t act like a respectful decent human being when his sister was helping him out. If he respected your time, was ready when you showed up and didn\u2019t shout at you and demand more all the time, his kids would still have a ride to school. But he\u2019s an AH who won\u2019t behave properly so now they won\u2019t have a ride. All on him.", "Nta. Stop immediately", "NTA they're taking you for a ride (literally)", "NTA\n\n His kids, his problem", "NTA\nMake a calculation of how much it cost you to make this detour every day. Add 10% for bossy niece and 10% for kicking your driver seat and ask for money for week in advance. \nYou will get hate (unlike now\ud83d\ude44) but you will be off the hook.", "NTA, if you stop helping. He will find another way. I\u2019m not going out of my way every morning and then someone not be appreciative. Then have the nerve to ask for more", "NTA\n\n1. You decided to help and you definitely didn\u2019t need to. He isn\u2019t appreciative at all. Plus, you inconvenienced yourself to help.\n\n2.If you\u2019re brother doesn\u2019t have his own transportation or DL then why isn\u2019t he at least helping you pay for gas? Is he trying to get his own DL, or is there a reason he can\u2019t? I get there are certain circumstances, it\u2019s just hard to see why he doesn\u2019t have one at 37yo.\n\n3. It\u2019s your car, so everyone needs to respect your rules or no ride, kids and dad. You are not the bad guy at all for enforcing your rules with YOUR property. If they don\u2019t like it then they can stop riding with you.\n\n4. I get you were also late, but if he and his kids are constantly late then he has no right to get upset when you don\u2019t take him to his job because you\u2019re trying to be responsible to yourself. You and your family come first.\n\n5. Depending on the situation and how far away he is from the school, I have had a few friends call schools and explain their situations. The schools have been more than happy to have the bus pick them up, even if they were \u201ctoo close\u201d. If they can\u2019t, then he needs to step up as DAD and walk his kids to school. Either way he is going to need to put in the work.\n\n6. Unfortunately, you are unintentionally rescuing him from the natural consequences of his actions. I would definitely stop helping him, especially considering he\u2019s not helping you and is instead complaining and demanding more. He is going to have to experience the consequences of his own choices and actions. There are many things he can do to make sure everyone gets to where they need to go, but it\u2019s his choice. Like\u2026 what I said in 5, take an uber or public bus to work, etc. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that and I wish you luck. Take care of you first. Set clear boundaries and don\u2019t allow them to be crossed. If they are then follow through with what you said will happen if they are. (Example: if you are not ready to leave in the morning by such and such time, I am leaving)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell him if he doesn't adjust his ungrateful attitude and parent his unruly children and doesn't stop with the extra runs here and there and if he can't get his kids ready on time, then you are done. Basically get in the car and STFU. But really he is not your responsibility and you didn't birth his children therefore also not your responsibility.

You can only go so far out of your way to help someone else without it affecting you.

The fact that you\u2019re the only one helping him right now makes me think he\u2019s already torched his other bridges. You have tried to do the right thing by helping him out even with your strained relationship, and he is not making an effort to even show up on time? He needs to get his ass up and walk them to school if he can\u2019t be respectful of your time. You already seem to have a lot on your plate that he is just adding to.

But you can\u2019t light yourself and your kid on fire to keep them warm. \n\nYour family system sounds hella abusive. trust me it takes a survivor to know a survivor.

My mom was warned that without ongoing therapy he would only get worse, but once court ordered therapy was over, he quit going.\n\nIt's so hard to know if anything he's expressing is real genuine care for his family or if it's all just manipulation to keep people attached to him.\n\nThat's why I still get pulled back in when I try to distance myself. He knows how to pull at a person's heartstrings and make you feel bad and guilty.", "Ah, shame. \n\nLots of kids in my country use those little scooters with parent walking but doesn\u2019t sound like that would work here.\n\nDo encourage him to discuss it with the school though.
