Update", "selftext": "\nHi guys,\n\nI thought I'd use the holiday to finally sit down and update this situation because there was a turn of events. First of all, I want to say thank you again for all the support I got - but I did not proceed with the lawsuit. I am going through the paperwork to drop everything and decided to settle this matter with my parents without a court involved. I think part of this is definitely the continued harassment my family put me through. I did not have a quiet minute since my first post, it was so bad that I am currently on vacation with a friend to get some space from this mess. I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money. I took my stepdads offer and he upped it to 2500\u20ac which is not near the amount they owe me - but I am not in a bad living situation and its fine. In the future the full child support will go on my account not hers, and she agreed to pay her part as well. I graduate university next year, as soon as I do, I have decided to move out of state and start from zero. I will stay in close contact with my sisters, but I will make sure my parents can never contact me again and if they do I will block them.One thing the comments kept telling me is that every adult in my life failed me, and it took almost taking my mother to court to realize how right everyone is. I was abused, I was treated awful - but they won't get to me anymore.\n\nThank you all for encouraging me. I needed to hear it. I'm wishing everyone the best.", "created_utc": 1683331994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966ow/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/", "score": 142, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12za2nl/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/)", "I\u2019m glad you are on the up and out!

Your ability to be flexible in your solution rather than rigidly pursuing something that will cause you huge amounts of suffering to get there shows you care more about yourself than most people realise, and a level of maturity most people on Reddit seem to have avoided. Go team YOU!", "It\u2019s interesting. Child support is usually owed to parents, not children. I\u2019m curious how the legal system works over there or if this was an out of court settlement", "I'm so happy you got a resolution!", "I am so glad that you are going to be able to have a relationship with your sisters and you have a plan for the future.  Good luck!", "Ditto. Prepare for awesomeness.  And trust yourself. Wishing you the best!", "I get the payments because I'm still in university and was basically forced out of my home earlier than i could fully support myself. The law here states that child support must be paid until the first vocational training is complete. This could either mean a university degree or an internship or something along those lines. If I don't live with my parents and I'm over the age of 18, they have to pay me directly.", "Thank you so much :)", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "LIt is never due to the parents, they work as money administrators, but it must be understood that it is an obligation of the father towards the minor child or without work capacity (in theory, studying full-time prevents being able to carry out work activities, so you become dependent on your parents) once the child can represent himself the task of administrator of the father disappears but justice is pleaded if the change of addressee is not requested the parents will continue to be administrators", "I thought was owed to the kid in the US. Like child is support is for the child. Alimony is for the partner.\n\nI also have heard of people saying kids can see their own parents for child support in the United States as well. It\u2019s like mentioned on a lot of it might AITA threads.", "Or mother. It is the father more often, but some mothers have to pay CS too."]}
