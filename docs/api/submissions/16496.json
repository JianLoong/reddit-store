Update", "selftext": "\nHi guys,\n\nI thought I'd use the holiday to finally sit down and update this situation because there was a turn of events. First of all, I want to say thank you again for all the support I got - but I did not proceed with the lawsuit. I am going through the paperwork to drop everything and decided to settle this matter with my parents without a court involved. I think part of this is definitely the continued harassment my family put me through. I did not have a quiet minute since my first post, it was so bad that I am currently on vacation with a friend to get some space from this mess. I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money. I took my stepdads offer and he upped it to 2500\u20ac which is not near the amount they owe me - but I am not in a bad living situation and its fine. In the future the full child support will go on my account not hers, and she agreed to pay her part as well. I graduate university next year, as soon as I do, I have decided to move out of state and start from zero. I will stay in close contact with my sisters, but I will make sure my parents can never contact me again and if they do I will block them.One thing the comments kept telling me is that every adult in my life failed me, and it took almost taking my mother to court to realize how right everyone is. I was abused, I was treated awful - but they won't get to me anymore.\n\nThank you all for encouraging me. I needed to hear it. I'm wishing everyone the best.", "created_utc": 1683331994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966ow/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/", "score": 738, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12za2nl/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/)", "I\u2019m glad you are on the up and out!

Your ability to be flexible in your solution rather than rigidly pursuing something that will cause you huge amounts of suffering to get there shows you care more about yourself than most people realise, and a level of maturity most people on Reddit seem to have avoided. Go team YOU!", "It\u2019s interesting. Child support is usually owed to parents, not children. I\u2019m curious how the legal system works over there or if this was an out of court settlement", "I'm so happy you got a resolution!", "I am so glad that you are going to be able to have a relationship with your sisters and you have a plan for the future.  Good luck!", "Ditto. Prepare for awesomeness.  And trust yourself. Wishing you the best!", "I get the payments because I'm still in university and was basically forced out of my home earlier than i could fully support myself. The law here states that child support must be paid until the first vocational training is complete. This could either mean a university degree or an internship or something along those lines. If I don't live with my parents and I'm over the age of 18, they have to pay me directly.", "Thank you so much :)", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "LIt is never due to the parents, they work as money administrators, but it must be understood that it is an obligation of the father towards the minor child or without work capacity (in theory, studying full-time prevents being able to carry out work activities, so you become dependent on your parents) once the child can represent himself the task of administrator of the father disappears but justice is pleaded if the change of addressee is not requested the parents will continue to be administrators", "I thought was owed to the kid in the US. Like child is support is for the child. Alimony is for the partner.\n\nI also have heard of people saying kids can see their own parents for child support in the United States as well. It\u2019s like mentioned on a lot of it might AITA threads.", "Or mother. It is the father more often, but some mothers have to pay CS too.", ">I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money.\n\nI think you are making a mistake. If they can use that as a lever to get you to lay off now, they will use it in the future as well. And they have shown themselves to be unreliable liars. You can't trust that they will keep up with every agreement you make now over a longer period of time. As soon as the feel the imminent danger is over, you might be back to square one.\n\nI still hope it goes well for you.", ">I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money.\n\nI understand why you'd make this decision, but it's a mistake in my opinion. This issue is more invented than you realise once you take a step back, take a breath, and look at it for what it really is. Your mother is going to poison them against you if she wants either way, that you can't stop. So, either way, it comes down to whether or not your sisters want to reach out to you of their own free will once they become adults. The conundrum is not cave in and keep your sisters or sue and lose your sisters. It is actually cave in and have a slightly better chance at staying in touch with your sisters or sue and have a slightly smaller, but still very real, chance at staying in touch with your sisters.\n\nIf you valued them so much, what example do you want to set for them as an older sibling? That they shouldn't stand up for themselves or their rights? That they should let others walk all over them? That harassment and bullying wins?", "It depends. When my parents got divorced, their divorce decree stated that the custodial parent got custody once I turned 18. Then I would get the payments until I graduated high school (I turned 18 right in the middle of my senior year) and then if I went to college, I would have receives child support payments until I turned 21.", "It is supposed to be used for the child, but is owed to the other parent as the one who will actually spend it supporting the child. The money does not belong to the child, it is to compensate the custodial parent for some of the expenses associated with caring for the child.", "Verklag diese Unmenschen. Deine Entscheidung ist wirklich nicht die beste.", "Your dad\u2019s a wuss.", "I am happy that you have made the decision to go NC after you finish your education.\n\nGood Luck.", "Thank you so much, all this encouragement really helps :)", "I think it's a bit unfair to say that I \"caved in\" - my sisters still live with my parents. If i went through with the lawsuit it would affect their life as well. I'd rather be there as a good older brother and show to my parents that I am there for them and they won't take them away from me and tolerate my awful parents until I can be sure I never have to talk to them again.", "So your sisters are your stepdads kids??", "\u201cNever\u201d is a staggeringly wrong statement. It\u2019s completely dependent on jurisdiction. In my entire country, child support is owed to the parent and never to the child. If a parent puts 100% of their child support payment toward rent, rather than school supplies for the kid, that\u2019s their decision to make, as the person responsible for deciding what\u2019s best for the kid. \n\nPeople here get mislead by (mostly American) people saying online \u201cchild support is *always* owed to the child, not the parent\u201d when that\u2019s simply not true, and waste tons more money trying to sue for the child support money when they have no legal right to it.", "How would it affect their lives? If your mother and stepdad are threatening in any way to reduce their quality of life to spite you, that's all the more reason not to embolden them or let them continue running unchecked.", "That may be true, but then I'd rather cave in and find a solution than let my sister's suffer from my parents incompetence. You could call that weak but if i stick it to my parents, my sisters are still the one's carrying the consequences of that. All 5 of us are eventually going to go no contact with them and Karma will handle the rest", "I still don't fully understand how this is an either/or deal. Does suing them somehow legally empower your parents to have more and exclusive say over your sisters? Or is it a case of misconstruing that every important decision has to be a tough one with evenly matched choices; \"suing these terrible people who are so clearly in the wrong seems too obvious, there must be huge downsides to this... hence I'm going to over-imagine that this will make things worse for my sisters even though there is no legal or rational basis to believe it'll make a large difference\". Not every big decision needs to have evenly matched options, sometimes the obvious one is actually just that much better.", "No offense but there's more consequences to a situation like this than just legal actions. I think I know my parents and their tactics", "And I am saying you are right about what terrible things they are capable of but wrong in having the cause of their behaviour backwards.\n\n- You were a helpless child who couldn't push back = your mother was emboldened and denied you the basic right to breathe\n\n- You trusted her and left her unchecked to send over the money you are entitled to = she illegally kept a significant portion for herself\n\n- You finally pushed back and started legal actions = they finally relented and offered reparations for the first time ever\n\nIf you go back to letting them them have their way, they will go back to taking full advantage of it. This has been the pattern that defined their behaviour for decades. And this includes exploiting your sisters because they now know you're too scared to pursue legal action so nothing can stop them from fully indulging their sadistic tendencies.", "Good luck OP, I hope everything goes as you have planned it :)", "In the post says one stepsister, the 18 yo, the other two younger siblings are half-sisters.", "Ignore the critics. Too many people here want vengeance, not happiness.", "YTA to yourself. You're already going no contact, why not simply get your money first ?!", "In Germany there's \"Unterhaltspflicht\" which means that parents have to support their kids through university. Since the parents are divorced, they split that cost and it goes directly to the kid/student", "It's also a matter of time and stress. Again, i might be weak for this i don't care at this point but it's going to take forever to settle this even if everything falls into my favor when it comes to the legal side. I just want to focus on my degree and myself", "I've heard people say lots of stupid things ,- that doesn't make them right.\n\nChild support is FOR the child, not TO the child. (Above 18 for non-minors like OP is different than a 12yr old) So it goes to a guardian to pay rent, food, bills etc that the child causes.", "May I ask where you\u2019re from? Sounds rather unusual. I\u2019m German and here it\u2019s also the child\u2019s money and the parent is only the trustee.\nThe money can also only be spent for direct needs of the childs. 100% towards rent would be illegal.", "I'm just glad you're in Germany. The US where I live at is a third world country where the child is at the complete mercy of the parent. Makes me sick.", "\"I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money.\"\n\n\nOk, I don't necessarily agree with your decision but I understand the situation, but\n\n\"I will stay in close contact with my sisters, but I will make sure my parents can never contact me again\u00a0\"\n\n\nWhich one is it? \n\nBecause from my point of you you're only losing. You said you don't want to lose your sisters that's why you won't go through with the court proceedings but then you said you will stay in contact?! \n\nThe oldest is 18. You said you've been working since you were 16. The 18 year old can certainly keep in contact with you via Whatsapp and keep you updated about your sisters. \n\nYou're doing exactly what your mum and her husband wanted by backing off. The only right thing to do would be to get the money that is rightfully yours. \n\nYou get that your mum stole from you, right? \n\nYou said yourself that she owes you more than 2500\u20ac. That's not a little sum, it's a lot of money that could help you.\n\nThis is all coming from a German btw. Please do not give in to the ridiculous farce they're trying to pull", "In the US child support belongs to the child and the custodial parent administers the payments on the child's behalf. The (adult) child suing for arrears is not common but it is possible to do it.", ">Your mother is going to poison them against you if she wants either way, that you can't stop.\n\nOP stated in the original post  that the eldest sister of 18 wants to move out of the house, while living in a country where it is *not* that common for an 18yo to move out of the house, and that she might move in with OP, meaning the *step*sister (who is not necessarily on OP's side given other stories on reddit) is also realising that the dynamic in the house is everything but okay.\n\nI mean with that: if the eldest sister is wanting to do something like that, it's possible that *more if not* *all the children* are not being treated as they should and deep down they know they know it/don't like how it is. So yeah, mom might want to try poisoning them against OP, but might not be able to considering the damage she and stepdad already have done. I think the youngest might be able to be influenced (OP talked about being scared of losing the youngest sister), but the stepsister and probably the eldest halfsister are aware enough of what is going on.", "I meant I'll stay in contact with my sisters as you suggested through WhatsApp and social media and support them if they need it plus allow them to come over but I'll cut off my parents. I know my mom stole from me I know I'm not making a logical decision from an outside perspective but this situation has been immensely difficult to handle on my own irl. As i said i really am happy for the amount of involvement and encouragement but i think people forget that nobody in my family really supports me in this", "I see this is a Germany thing. Just curious what happens if the child after 18 chooses to not due any vocational training onmr anything. Is the parent required to support the child indefinitely or is there a certain age where it is finally cut off no matter what?", "But it is all is in support of the mother because if they were still married they would pay equally for things i.e. car to transport kids clothes for kids. So it would pay back mother for money she has already spent on the child.", "In the US (or at least the vast majority of the US) child support is for the kids but it is owed to the parent.  A kid cannot sue for it in any jurisdiction I have experience with in the US.", "You should've blocked everyone pressuring you instead or, hell, change your phone number.", "I think the final age is 27 if Im not entirely wrong and if you work a full-time job your parents don't have to pay you anymore", "As far as I remember, there is no payment if there is no proof that the child is in any further education. For instance, I'm from Bulgaria and so are my parents, but my dad emigrated to Garmany in my first year of uni. I went to uni in the UK, but the German government paid my dad support money (no idea what the actual term is) for me until I finished my degree, since he lived there and paid taxes there etc. But he had to prove that I was in uni which is simple enough to do. Once I graduated that support stopped. Does that make sense?", "That\u2019s not the case in Germany.", "Yes.. and her stepfather is their bio dad.. ?", "Yea completely. I was just imagining 35 year Olds sitting around trying to live off their child support lol. Trust me I'm from the US and if they had that always here, people would 100 percent be people trying to pull it off.", "Huh,  interesting. I\u2019m from Minnesota and here child support is meant to keep the child in a certain standard of living. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s really hard to truly estimate how much is spent on a child. When doing accounting for the money you can say it all went towards the rent, or it could be considered to be reimbursement for other expenses incurred if raising a child. Because I would be shocked if the cost of raising a child was less than rent in a place that isn\u2019t astronomically inflated.", "Pretty much the entire US works under the system where child support is owed from one parent to the other.  There may be a few rare exceptions, we have 50 states and several allow broad local authority so it's impossible to say that any law works the same way 100% of the time here, but generally that's how it works.\n\nThe general assumption here is that the custodial parent is taking care of the child's needs, and the non custodial parent is paying to remburse them.  Tracking every penny would be difficult and burdensome.  If the child's needs are not being address the remedy is to go to court and get custody changed.  Who is to say how much of rent is due to the child, yes they need a bedroom so you could compare to a similar home with 1 less room but maybe the location was picked to get a better school district.  Who is to say that the parent wouldn't be driving a 1992 Honda Civic with 300k miles on it if they weren't worried about their child's safety so the entire cost of that brand new SUV might be directly related to raising the child.  It gets real fuzzy real fast when you start tracking every penny and people would still abuse the system.\n\nThere are definitely merits to both systems and times when both systems fail.", "Let me give you an example.  I live in a high cost of living area where my ex would struggle to afford.  She certainly can not afford the rent on a place with room for my kids.  So most of the child support I pay goes to her rent so she can stay in the area where our kids have lives, and afford them to have rooms when they stay with her.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s in the kids best interest if their Mom had no room for them? If their Mom could not afford to share custody?  If their Mom had to move far away where she can afford to live?", "Where is that information mentioned? I can't seem to find it in the posts/OP's comments", "Haha, I can totally imagine people trying to scam the system! As far as I know you also need to be under a certain age. So for instance if the kid skips a year and then decides to go to uni  they would still get the support, but only up to the age of (I think) 25."]}
