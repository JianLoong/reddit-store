Update", "selftext": "\nHi guys,\n\nI thought I'd use the holiday to finally sit down and update this situation because there was a turn of events. First of all, I want to say thank you again for all the support I got - but I did not proceed with the lawsuit. I am going through the paperwork to drop everything and decided to settle this matter with my parents without a court involved. I think part of this is definitely the continued harassment my family put me through. I did not have a quiet minute since my first post, it was so bad that I am currently on vacation with a friend to get some space from this mess. I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money. I took my stepdads offer and he upped it to 2500\u20ac which is not near the amount they owe me - but I am not in a bad living situation and its fine. In the future the full child support will go on my account not hers, and she agreed to pay her part as well. I graduate university next year, as soon as I do, I have decided to move out of state and start from zero. I will stay in close contact with my sisters, but I will make sure my parents can never contact me again and if they do I will block them.One thing the comments kept telling me is that every adult in my life failed me, and it took almost taking my mother to court to realize how right everyone is. I was abused, I was treated awful - but they won't get to me anymore.\n\nThank you all for encouraging me. I needed to hear it. I'm wishing everyone the best.", "created_utc": 1683331994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966ow/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/", "score": 344, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12za2nl/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/)", "I\u2019m glad you are on the up and out! One foot in front of the other. And I\u2019m glad you have a resolution that isn\u2019t \u2026 insulting but a start.   \n\n\nMan\u2026 you are going to be an awesome human at the other end of all this\u2026 you are well on the path already! Your ability to be flexible in your solution rather than rigidly pursuing something that will cause you huge amounts of suffering to get there shows you care more about yourself than most people realise, and a level of maturity most people on Reddit seem to have avoided. Go team YOU!", "It\u2019s interesting. Child support is usually owed to parents, not children. I\u2019m curious how the legal system works over there or if this was an out of court settlement", "I'm so happy you got a resolution!", "I am so glad that you are going to be able to have a relationship with your sisters and you have a plan for the future.  Good luck!", "Ditto. Prepare for awesomeness.  And trust yourself. Wishing you the best!", "I get the payments because I'm still in university and was basically forced out of my home earlier than i could fully support myself. The law here states that child support must be paid until the first vocational training is complete. This could either mean a university degree or an internship or something along those lines. If I don't live with my parents and I'm over the age of 18, they have to pay me directly.", "Thank you so much :)", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "LIt is never due to the parents, they work as money administrators, but it must be understood that it is an obligation of the father towards the minor child or without work capacity (in theory, studying full-time prevents being able to carry out work activities, so you become dependent on your parents) once the child can represent himself the task of administrator of the father disappears but justice is pleaded if the change of addressee is not requested the parents will continue to be administrators", "I thought was owed to the kid in the US. Like child is support is for the child. Alimony is for the partner.\n\nI also have heard of people saying kids can see their own parents for child support in the United States as well. It\u2019s like mentioned on a lot of it might AITA threads.", "Or mother. It is the father more often, but some mothers have to pay CS too.", ">I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money.\n\nI think you are making a mistake. If they can use that as a lever to get you to lay off now, they will use it in the future as well. And they have shown themselves to be unreliable liars. You can't trust that they will keep up with every agreement you make now over a longer period of time. As soon as the feel the imminent danger is over, you might be back to square one.\n\nI still hope it goes well for you.", ">I decided that not losing my sisters mattered more to me than the money.\n\nI understand why you'd make this decision, but it's a mistake in my opinion. This issue is more invented than you realise once you take a step back, take a breath, and look at it for what it really is. Your mother is going to poison them against you if she wants either way, that you can't stop. So, either way, it comes down to whether or not your sisters want to reach out to you of their own free will once they become adults. The conundrum is not cave in and keep your sisters or sue and lose your sisters. It is actually cave in and have a slightly better chance at staying in touch with your sisters or sue and have a slightly smaller, but still very real, chance at staying in touch with your sisters.\n\nIf you valued them so much, what example do you want to set for them as an older sibling? That they shouldn't stand up for themselves or their rights? That they should let others walk all over them? That harassment and bullying wins?", "It depends. When my parents got divorced, their divorce decree stated that the custodial parent got custody once I turned 18. Then I would get the payments until I graduated high school (I turned 18 right in the middle of my senior year) and then if I went to college, I would have receives child support payments until I turned 21.", "It is supposed to be used for the child, but is owed to the other parent as the one who will actually spend it supporting the child. The money does not belong to the child, it is to compensate the custodial parent for some of the expenses associated with caring for the child.", "Verklag diese Unmenschen. Deine Entscheidung ist wirklich nicht die beste.", "Your dad\u2019s a wuss.", "I am happy that you have made the decision to go NC after you finish your education.\n\nGood Luck.", "Thank you so much, all this encouragement really helps :)", "I think it's a bit unfair to say that I \"caved in\" - my sisters still live with my parents. If i went through with the lawsuit it would affect their life as well. I'd rather be there as a good older brother and show to my parents that I am there for them and they won't take them away from me and tolerate my awful parents until I can be sure I never have to talk to them again.", "So your sisters are your stepdads kids??", "\u201cNever\u201d is a staggeringly wrong statement. It\u2019s completely dependent on jurisdiction. In my entire country, child support is owed to the parent and never to the child. If a parent puts 100% of their child support payment toward rent, rather than school supplies for the kid, that\u2019s their decision to make, as the person responsible for deciding what\u2019s best for the kid. \n\nPeople here get mislead by (mostly American) people saying online \u201cchild support is *always* owed to the child, not the parent\u201d when that\u2019s simply not true, and waste tons more money trying to sue for the child support money when they have no legal right to it.", "How would it affect their lives? If your mother and stepdad are threatening in any way to reduce their quality of life to spite you, that's all the more reason not to embolden them or let them continue running unchecked.", "That may be true, but then I'd rather cave in and find a solution than let my sister's suffer from my parents incompetence. You could call that weak but if i stick it to my parents, my sisters are still the one's carrying the consequences of that. All 5 of us are eventually going to go no contact with them and Karma will handle the rest", "I still don't fully understand how this is an either/or deal. Does suing them somehow legally empower your parents to have more and exclusive say over your sisters? Or is it a case of misconstruing that every important decision has to be a tough one with evenly matched choices; \"suing these terrible people who are so clearly in the wrong seems too obvious, there must be huge downsides to this... hence I'm going to over-imagine that this will make things worse for my sisters even though there is no legal or rational basis to believe it'll make a large difference\". Not every big decision needs to have evenly matched options, sometimes the obvious one is actually just that much better.", "No offense but there's more consequences to a situation like this than just legal actions. I think I know my parents and their tactics", "And I am saying you are right about what terrible things they are capable of but wrong in having the cause of their behaviour backwards.\n\n- You were a helpless child who couldn't push back = your mother was emboldened and denied you the basic right to breathe\n\n- You trusted her and left her unchecked to send over the money you are entitled to = she illegally kept a significant portion for herself\n\n- You finally pushed back and started legal actions = they finally relented and offered reparations for the first time ever\n\nIf you go back to letting them them have their way, they will go back to taking full advantage of it. This has been the pattern that defined their behaviour for decades. And this includes exploiting your sisters because they now know you're too scared to pursue legal action so nothing can stop them from fully indulging their sadistic tendencies."]}
