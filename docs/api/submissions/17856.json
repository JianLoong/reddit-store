She gleefully went on to tell me that my Aunt(69F) had a friend that she referred to my daughter who is a hairstylist.

Why would she say that, \u201cFriend\u201ddoesn\u2019t know my daughter, many people have told her how fat she is.  She is fucking pregnant. Everyone became silent and my mom shrunk into a corner in the kitchen and told me to forget she should have never told me about it. I asked my mom how she would have felt if someone said that to me, her daughter? No response. I\u2019m guessing she was embarrassed, but I couldn\u2019t tell. Everyone went on like nothing happened, but I\u2019m still mad and hurt for my daughter. \nHow do I work with this?", "created_utc": 1684689241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o0ib0/aita_for_getting_pod_at_my_mom_for_telling_what/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your aunt told the hairstylist that your daughter was pregnant, so she knew before hand. And then when the hairstylist arrived, knowing that the daughter was pregnant, she called her fat. Unprompted. \n\nFirst off there's no acceptable reason to be calling anyone fat, but especially if you are working and providing someone a service. That is extremely unprofessional.\n\nAnd you mom thought that was funny?!? Wtf??\n\nAnd hell no, you're NTA. Hell, I'd probably have chewed out the aunt as well, and gotten the hairstylists info to leave a review, because that is just unacceptable.", "That's rude and spiteful. NTA. Congrats to your daughter on her pregnancy and to you on your future grandchild.", "Wow that is so insensitive. Your definetly nta for being upset. You probably shouldnt have yelled but its totally understandable that you did. Yout mother is communicating to you that its funny to make fun of your daughter. Maybe you should talk to her later that you dont want her to do that.", "Wow!  Unless Mother & Aunt have some form of dementia, I can't see why on earth   they'd think that ok.  Never mind funny.\nNTA", "nta- your aunt\u2019s friend and your mom are cruel people. who the heck would ever say something like that to another human being\ud83d\ude1e", "Your poor daughter. Your mom is the worst. It\u2019s awful that she found that funny instead of protecting her granddaughter. I\u2019m sure your mom also wonders why she\u2019ll end up alone. It all makes sense now.", "NTA - why would anyone think that was funny?", "You live 800 miles away from your daughter. Your daughter didn\u2019t tell you about this story.\n\nI understand not finding it funny. At the same time it sounds like you don\u2019t actually know how much your daughter was bothered by this. \n\nYTA slightly.

My mom might be losing her mental faculties. This is the first time I expressed my true feelings when something bothers me to my mom.

She did not tell me of this incident. She did tell me of the several other times my sister and my mom commented on her looking so large when she was first pregnant with her Monodi twins. She was hemorrhaging and that made her look larger than normal. She lost the twins a year ago February. Since she used IVF to become pregnant after her miscarriage, the hormones that she had to inject to stay pregnant made her look more full. She has several clients tell her how big she\u2019s getting or how far along she is and the show surprise when she they\u2019d people she still has a month to go. \nI\u2019d like to ask, when did it become \u201cOK\u201d to comment on how large pregnant people are? It\u2019s so insulting and disrespectful. \nMy daughter didnt tell me because she didn\u2019t want me to have ill feelings toward my Aunt and my aunts friend.

I would definitely have a stern talking to your aunt about her friend because that is just unacceptable", "NTA! Not one bit!!

Wtf! How do you proceed? Post and edit that you are going to show her the comments of this post and I think we can get your point across! Imma momma bear too, I will tear someone up for looking at my kids wrong.", "NTA. What that \u2018friend\u2019 said is (lots of sweary adjectives) rude. It would break my heart to hear my own mother laughing about such a thing. Funny how she expects your daughter to have a good sense of humor about being degraded by a stranger but can\u2019t handle being called out on her own shitty behavior.", "NTA. That was incredibly inappropriate and cruel to your daughter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope everything goes well with her pregnancy and she gets to enjoy motherhood! Congrats to you both!", "NTA.\n\nYour mother and the aunt's friend are AHs. You just don't say shit like that, and it sure as heck is NOT funny.", "nta. im 35 weeks and if someone said that to me id start sobbing. thank you for caring about your daughter", "NTA, and good on you for sticking up for the daughter.  I'm shocked that the grandmother (OP's ma) saw the whole thing as funny.  Was this a setup between the aunt and the friend, or was the friend just a jerk flying solo?", "NTA", "That hit home,.. my mom is an asshole.

I call BS on the Christ like crap, christians should not act as such. I\u2019m learning that there is no hate like Christian love. Friend flying like a jerk solo, but my aunt is so naive.
