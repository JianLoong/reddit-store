First, thanks for all the helpful comments, insights, and awards. We were very overwhelmed and grateful. And thanks to the mods for helping with this update. I've never had a post get this much attention and didn't know how to do this. \n\nThe biggest thing is, we are married. In the end, my wife\u2019s sister and BIL saved the day. Originally, the wedding was on the 18th at BIL\u2019s restaurant, that was the date and place where we went from friends to dating five years ago. On the day of the OP, wife went to see her sister, they suggested having the wedding a week earlier, on the 11th. It felt like the best option, BIL was willing to do the work, because wife is like a sister to him. His team and him got a generous tip from my dad. \n\nWife, SIL, BIL and I told all the guests save my family of the date change. Wife didn\u2019t want to tell people why. Amazingly, everyone made it work except for three people. My family was told the morning of the wedding, just to make sure wife\u2019s father would not have time to come to the wedding, as he lives 15 hours away from us. My family didn\u2019t complain because they knew that they messed up. It was all a bit stressful, but my wife felt like a spy on a mission and had fun with it. I was glad to see her get excited again. And there was no sign of her father at the wedding, so I guess mom finally listened. \n\nIn the week before the wedding, we met my family to talk several times. These were long long talks. Why my mom did it? She just thought she knew better. No excuse other than arrogance. They all apologized. My wife said, one family torn apart by her father\u2019s actions was enough. She insisted that they were invited. So that was that. However, we made it clear, that contact with her father would be punished much harder in the future, especially when it comes to children. It\u2019s forgiven but not forgotten, I guess.\n\nAs to what wife\u2019s father found out from my mom, apparently not much. He knew a bunch already, from my wife\u2019s eldest brother. Mom filled in gaps. That brother is the only of my wife\u2019s siblings that was still in touch with their father. Brother and wife were on thin ice before that already for many but different reasons. Yes, we let that brother attend the wedding, mostly because we didn\u2019t want more drama. But we\u2019ll tackle that when wife feels ready to do so. We did have a honeymoon to get to first.\n\nAll in all, I think we are fine. Wife is very hurt still, more so by her brother\u2019s actions now. With my family, we\u2019ll work on it. The imminent threat is dealt with, now we start fixing the damage. Through it all, my wife was amazingly calm and reflected. It made me much more grateful that I get to be with her.", "created_utc": 1669629289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6siw3/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/", "score": 1434, "replies": ["Congrats on your wedding, I'm happy that everything was fine that day.\n\nRegarding the aftermath of this situation, your wife has shown much wisdom.\n\n\rTime will tell you if some relationships can be mended, and which ones will have to be abandoned for your and your family's well-being.", "Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynn0jd/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/)", "Congrats on getting married!", "Congratulations! This is a wonderful update.", "Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations.\n\nHopefully your mother doesn't do anything stupid because she thinks she knows better in the future.", "Was your moms apology in your opinion genuine or was it an \"I'm sorry, but...\"\n\nAlso I'm glad it all worked out! Congrats on the wedding and all the best to you and your wife :)", "Congratulations on your nuptials!! I do hope your wife keeps some distance with your Mum until your Mum shows genuine remorse and makes sustained effort to rebuild trust.\n\nWish you both the best in your marriage and as newlyweds.", "I\u2019m very happy for you! You both made wise choices in how you communicated your hurt & your distrust, and then also being able to move past it. Your wife\u2019s forbearance is remarkable.", "Congrats!! I love your wife\u2019s comment, \u201cOne family torn up by my father\u2019s actions is enough,\u201d and that being the impetus for moving forward with forgiveness. May you have many years of wedded bliss. As someone who\u2019s been happily married for 23 years, we have two rules: 1. Never go to bed angry with each other, as sometimes you just need to say \u201cI love you\u201d and we\u2019ll see how we feel about things when we\u2019re not tired (typically, you forgot why you were fighting in the first place.) 2. Never sleep apart because you\u2019re upset with one another. Cracks in a marriage are like a sidewalk, in that they only get bigger over time, so you need to provide constant maintenance.

Her brother needs to learn the saying about snitches thou", "Thank you!", "From what we could tell, it was genuine. I suppose my initial unitivation made her take a look at her actions and blew some sense into her.", "I love how you stood your ground and people rallied around you!  Congratulations!  As you said, you got through the one day, and there's a long road ahead, but you've commanded a lot of respect in what you've done so far.", "Congratulations. I\u2019m so happy you found a way to make it work. Your wife sounds like an amazing woman.", "Wow! I am very happy that you both could have the day you wanted and that your mom got some sense knocked into her.", "Congrats on the wedding, I wish you both all the best and take care", "> It\u2019s forgiven but not forgotten\n\nThis is how it should be. I see your wife is a calm and reasonable person.\n\nHappy to see the big day went off without a hitch (except for your BILs action). Wish you and your wife an incredible life ahead.", "Congrats on the nuptials. The trust is not there anymore with your mother. She violated your wifes privacy and wishes. Would keep her at bay.", "Fuck yes! Congrats!", "Great update! I hope Mom actually learned her lesson.", "This is beautiful, congrats to you both.  What a wonderful and level-headed person your wife sounds like.  I certainly could not go through the betrayal as gracefully as she did. \n\nIf you guys can get through this and make it work, it certainly bodes well towards a lifetime of happiness together.\n\nPs.. your mom still sucks (balls).", "I'm so glad that everything turned out the best it could. Congratulations to you both!", "Congratulations on your wedding and for finding a wife with so much grace and maturity.", "I rarely argue with my husband but they're usually a big blow out when they happen. Only once in 12 years have we slept apart entirely due to an argument (other times one of us has fallen asleep on the couch unintentionally). For me it's in part because it's something his ex wife did often - have a fight, threaten break up, sleep in the spare room. One day she threatened break up and he agreed it was a good idea. And she was like wtf? The main reason I don't sleep in the spare room when we argue is because we love each other very much, even when we argue. And I'd miss him", "The best result you can expect from this situation. If your wife is okay with giving your mom another chance make sure to let your mom know she's on thin ice.", "This is the best update!\n\nKudos to your new wife and to you for working to maintain good family relations.  That is a very mature and considerate response.\n\nYes your mum screwed up, and you all had to do some scrambling to fix it, but you did.  And imo, it was not a reason to cut her from your life and make a bad situation worse.  Your wife is a very reasoned and gracious person.\n\nYou have resolved this incident perfectly and admirably. I think you and your bride have a very happy married life ahead of you.", "I missed your previous post, congratulations I'm glad your wife was able to enjoy your wedding.\n\nYour mum was definitely arrogant in thinking this was something she could \"fix\".\n\nI haven't spoken to my own father in 3yrs and it took me 30yrs to go NC. My in-laws are wonderful but we thought we'd have issues with my BIL as he kept asking why my father wasn't invited because \"he's still my father\".\n\nSo I told him would he still want his father in his life if he had not only physically and mentally abused your mother but mentally abused you and siblings, and he said no, to which I replied you've got your answer then, and he's never brought back up.\n\nPeople in \"normal\" families do not instead what it is like growing up in an abusive/toxic/narcissistic family.\n\nBest wishes from an internet stranger.", "Your wife sounds like an absolute sweetheart.  One family torn apart by that man is enough, let's make amends.  What a beautiful soul.", "NTA  While you are lucky to have her, she is lucky that you have her back.  That you worked out a solution that created a wonderful, memorable and joyful moment for her out of this mess was especially impressive.  \n\nI can't speak to your mother's actions.  The rift she created will take years to bridge.  I think it was important to make it clear that her psychology persona needs to keep being retired.  You are not a case, but her children.  She needs to practice being a person.", "Your wife sounds like an angel of a person.", "My heart is melting. I'm so happy you have each other.", "Wonderful update! Congratulations to you both, and very best wishes. \n\nJudging by the way you both handled this, I have no doubt your life together will be happy. Good communication, clear boundaries, and grace. Bodes well for the future.", "Well done on making the best out of a tough situation.", "Congratulations. Great to hear you had a great day! I hope your wife will get her deserved rest in all this. Must have been an emotional rollercoaster! Hopefully her father does not see this as an invite to further contact and she can just live her life happily and safe.", "Let\u2019s hope your mother only needs to learn this lesson once. \n\nCongratulations on marrying a *spectacularly* brave and gracious woman. I hope she enjoys many years of peace and happiness, and I hope that your family is properly grateful to her for her generosity of spirit.", "Lovely update, thank you.  Your wife's incite that one family torn apart by her father was enough is quite wonderful.  I'm glad she was able to forgive your mother's outrageous entitlement.  I'm very glad to know that you and your wife will not forget your mom's overstep, especially when it comes to children.", "Congratulations, but now you know you cannot trust your mother. She will attempt to introduce FIL to any kids you have. Keep that in mind.", "The trust is not there anymore with your mother. She violated your wifes privacy and wishes.", "I would guess mom knows that, given what was involved in changing the wedding.", "I am SO happy to hear how things worked out, I was thinking about you both lately.\n\nNow please tell us how beautiful your wife looked the first time you saw her in her dress!", "It's disturbing that your mother was a psychologist.  I can't imagine how much damage she's done to vulnerable people during her career.\n\nIf I were your wife, I wouldn't trust her in the slightest ever again.  She rang a bell she can't unring and once trust is broken, it's nearly impossible to repair it.  I'm just appalled that your mother was actually a psychologist.", "Congrats on the marriage. I love the fact that everything worked out and went smoothly. Blessings for many years of marriage ahead.", "Congratulations!! I'm so happy that everything turned out great for your big day. But I have one question. What is wrong with your mother? I hope she doesn't try to invite your FIL to the hospital when you two have a baby. She might not be a good choice for a future babysitter.", "Congratulations on getting through the wedding and on to the honeymoon without uninvited guests.", "Congratulations I'm glad that everything worked out for you keep an eye on your mother this isn't over", "I\u2019m so happy to see this update!! Best wishes for your future together, way to be there for your wife. Congratulations!", "You both made it work beautifully with the help of loving family members. Congratulations - it sounds like despite all the drama surrounding the event, the wedding itself went off without a hitch. When there are so may negative and heartbreaking updates on AITA, its lovely to read something positive!", "Respectfully, the \u201cnever go to bed angry\u201d advice isn\u2019t always good. I\u2019ve been married 16 years and my parents nearly 50- we all agree that sometimes it\u2019s better to pause the argument and go to bed- the next morning, cooler/calmer heads prevail and things didn\u2019t get said when we were tired and heated. I\u2019d rather us go to bed angry and resolve it in the morning than have anyone say something they\u2019d regret. My husband is the same way. Usually things look much less fraught in the morning. \n\nEvery couple and person is different. My best advice is for a couple to learn how they each handle conflict and come up with their own \u201cconflict management plan\u201d. If they have an understand of how they want to address disagreements, it\u2019ll be easier to manage fairly when they happen. \n\nI\u2019m glad your plan works for you! \ud83d\ude00", "FOR WHAT? Wanting his wife to have a good time on her wedding day?"]}
