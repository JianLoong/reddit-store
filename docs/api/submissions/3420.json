First, thanks for all the helpful comments, insights, and awards. We were very overwhelmed and grateful. And thanks to the mods for helping with this update. I've never had a post get this much attention and didn't know how to do this. \n\nThe biggest thing is, we are married. In the end, my wife\u2019s sister and BIL saved the day. Originally, the wedding was on the 18th at BIL\u2019s restaurant, that was the date and place where we went from friends to dating five years ago. On the day of the OP, wife went to see her sister, they suggested having the wedding a week earlier, on the 11th. It felt like the best option, BIL was willing to do the work, because wife is like a sister to him. His team and him got a generous tip from my dad. \n\nWife, SIL, BIL and I told all the guests save my family of the date change. Wife didn\u2019t want to tell people why. Amazingly, everyone made it work except for three people. My family was told the morning of the wedding, just to make sure wife\u2019s father would not have time to come to the wedding, as he lives 15 hours away from us. My family didn\u2019t complain because they knew that they messed up. It was all a bit stressful, but my wife felt like a spy on a mission and had fun with it. I was glad to see her get excited again. And there was no sign of her father at the wedding, so I guess mom finally listened. \n\nIn the week before the wedding, we met my family to talk several times. These were long long talks. Why my mom did it? She just thought she knew better. No excuse other than arrogance. They all apologized. My wife said, one family torn apart by her father\u2019s actions was enough. She insisted that they were invited. So that was that. However, we made it clear, that contact with her father would be punished much harder in the future, especially when it comes to children. It\u2019s forgiven but not forgotten, I guess.\n\nAs to what wife\u2019s father found out from my mom, apparently not much. He knew a bunch already, from my wife\u2019s eldest brother. Mom filled in gaps. That brother is the only of my wife\u2019s siblings that was still in touch with their father. Brother and wife were on thin ice before that already for many but different reasons. Yes, we let that brother attend the wedding, mostly because we didn\u2019t want more drama. But we\u2019ll tackle that when wife feels ready to do so. We did have a honeymoon to get to first.\n\nAll in all, I think we are fine. Wife is very hurt still, more so by her brother\u2019s actions now. With my family, we\u2019ll work on it. The imminent threat is dealt with, now we start fixing the damage. Through it all, my wife was amazingly calm and reflected. It made me much more grateful that I get to be with her.", "created_utc": 1669629289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6siw3/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/", "score": 2672, "replies": ["Congrats on your wedding, I'm happy that everything was fine that day.\n\nRegarding the aftermath of this situation, your wife has shown much wisdom.\n\n\rTime will tell you if some relationships can be mended, and which ones will have to be abandoned for your and your family's well-being.", "Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynn0jd/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/)", "Congrats on getting married!", "Congratulations! This is a wonderful update.", "Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations.\n\nHopefully your mother doesn't do anything stupid because she thinks she knows better in the future.", "Was your moms apology in your opinion genuine or was it an \"I'm sorry, but...\"\n\nAlso I'm glad it all worked out! Congrats on the wedding and all the best to you and your wife :)", "Congratulations on your nuptials!! I do hope your wife keeps some distance with your Mum until your Mum shows genuine remorse and makes sustained effort to rebuild trust.\n\nWish you both the best in your marriage and as newlyweds.", "I\u2019m very happy for you! You both made wise choices in how you communicated your hurt & your distrust, and then also being able to move past it. Your wife\u2019s forbearance is remarkable.", "Congrats!! I love your wife\u2019s comment, \u201cOne family torn up by my father\u2019s actions is enough,\u201d and that being the impetus for moving forward with forgiveness. May you have many years of wedded bliss. As someone who\u2019s been happily married for 23 years, we have two rules: 1. Never go to bed angry with each other, as sometimes you just need to say \u201cI love you\u201d and we\u2019ll see how we feel about things when we\u2019re not tired (typically, you forgot why you were fighting in the first place.) 2. Never sleep apart because you\u2019re upset with one another. Cracks in a marriage are like a sidewalk, in that they only get bigger over time, so you need to provide constant maintenance.

Her brother needs to learn the saying about snitches thou", "Thank you!", "From what we could tell, it was genuine. I suppose my initial unitivation made her take a look at her actions and blew some sense into her.", "I love how you stood your ground and people rallied around you!  Congratulations!  As you said, you got through the one day, and there's a long road ahead, but you've commanded a lot of respect in what you've done so far.", "Congratulations. I\u2019m so happy you found a way to make it work. Your wife sounds like an amazing woman.", "Wow! I am very happy that you both could have the day you wanted and that your mom got some sense knocked into her.", "Congrats on the wedding, I wish you both all the best and take care", "> It\u2019s forgiven but not forgotten\n\nThis is how it should be. I see your wife is a calm and reasonable person.\n\nHappy to see the big day went off without a hitch (except for your BILs action). Wish you and your wife an incredible life ahead.", "Congrats on the nuptials. The trust is not there anymore with your mother. She violated your wifes privacy and wishes. Would keep her at bay.", "Fuck yes! Congrats!", "Great update! I hope Mom actually learned her lesson.", "This is beautiful, congrats to you both.  What a wonderful and level-headed person your wife sounds like.  I certainly could not go through the betrayal as gracefully as she did. \n\nIf you guys can get through this and make it work, it certainly bodes well towards a lifetime of happiness together.\n\nPs.. your mom still sucks (balls).", "I'm so glad that everything turned out the best it could. Congratulations to you both!", "Congratulations on your wedding and for finding a wife with so much grace and maturity.", "I rarely argue with my husband but they're usually a big blow out when they happen. Only once in 12 years have we slept apart entirely due to an argument (other times one of us has fallen asleep on the couch unintentionally). For me it's in part because it's something his ex wife did often - have a fight, threaten break up, sleep in the spare room. One day she threatened break up and he agreed it was a good idea. And she was like wtf? The main reason I don't sleep in the spare room when we argue is because we love each other very much, even when we argue. And I'd miss him", "The best result you can expect from this situation. If your wife is okay with giving your mom another chance make sure to let your mom know she's on thin ice.", "This is the best update!\n\nKudos to your new wife and to you for working to maintain good family relations.  That is a very mature and considerate response.\n\nYes your mum screwed up, and you all had to do some scrambling to fix it, but you did.  And imo, it was not a reason to cut her from your life and make a bad situation worse.  Your wife is a very reasoned and gracious person.\n\nYou have resolved this incident perfectly and admirably. I think you and your bride have a very happy married life ahead of you.", "I missed your previous post, congratulations I'm glad your wife was able to enjoy your wedding.\n\nYour mum was definitely arrogant in thinking this was something she could \"fix\".\n\nI haven't spoken to my own father in 3yrs and it took me 30yrs to go NC. My in-laws are wonderful but we thought we'd have issues with my BIL as he kept asking why my father wasn't invited because \"he's still my father\".\n\nSo I told him would he still want his father in his life if he had not only physically and mentally abused your mother but mentally abused you and siblings, and he said no, to which I replied you've got your answer then, and he's never brought back up.\n\nPeople in \"normal\" families do not instead what it is like growing up in an abusive/toxic/narcissistic family.\n\nBest wishes from an internet stranger.", "Your wife sounds like an absolute sweetheart.  One family torn apart by that man is enough, let's make amends.  What a beautiful soul.", "NTA  While you are lucky to have her, she is lucky that you have her back.  That you worked out a solution that created a wonderful, memorable and joyful moment for her out of this mess was especially impressive.  \n\nI can't speak to your mother's actions.  The rift she created will take years to bridge.  I think it was important to make it clear that her psychology persona needs to keep being retired.  You are not a case, but her children.  She needs to practice being a person.", "Your wife sounds like an angel of a person.", "My heart is melting. I'm so happy you have each other.", "Wonderful update! Congratulations to you both, and very best wishes. \n\nJudging by the way you both handled this, I have no doubt your life together will be happy. Good communication, clear boundaries, and grace. Bodes well for the future.", "Well done on making the best out of a tough situation.", "Congratulations. Great to hear you had a great day! I hope your wife will get her deserved rest in all this. Must have been an emotional rollercoaster! Hopefully her father does not see this as an invite to further contact and she can just live her life happily and safe.", "Let\u2019s hope your mother only needs to learn this lesson once. \n\nCongratulations on marrying a *spectacularly* brave and gracious woman. I hope she enjoys many years of peace and happiness, and I hope that your family is properly grateful to her for her generosity of spirit.", "Lovely update, thank you.  Your wife's incite that one family torn apart by her father was enough is quite wonderful.  I'm glad she was able to forgive your mother's outrageous entitlement.  I'm very glad to know that you and your wife will not forget your mom's overstep, especially when it comes to children.", "Congratulations, but now you know you cannot trust your mother. She will attempt to introduce FIL to any kids you have. Keep that in mind.", "The trust is not there anymore with your mother. She violated your wifes privacy and wishes.", "I would guess mom knows that, given what was involved in changing the wedding.", "I am SO happy to hear how things worked out, I was thinking about you both lately.\n\nNow please tell us how beautiful your wife looked the first time you saw her in her dress!", "It's disturbing that your mother was a psychologist.  I can't imagine how much damage she's done to vulnerable people during her career.\n\nIf I were your wife, I wouldn't trust her in the slightest ever again.  She rang a bell she can't unring and once trust is broken, it's nearly impossible to repair it.  I'm just appalled that your mother was actually a psychologist.", "Congrats on the marriage. I love the fact that everything worked out and went smoothly. Blessings for many years of marriage ahead.", "Congratulations!! I'm so happy that everything turned out great for your big day. But I have one question. What is wrong with your mother? I hope she doesn't try to invite your FIL to the hospital when you two have a baby. She might not be a good choice for a future babysitter.", "Congratulations on getting through the wedding and on to the honeymoon without uninvited guests.", "Congratulations I'm glad that everything worked out for you keep an eye on your mother this isn't over", "I\u2019m so happy to see this update!! Best wishes for your future together, way to be there for your wife. Congratulations!", "You both made it work beautifully with the help of loving family members. Congratulations - it sounds like despite all the drama surrounding the event, the wedding itself went off without a hitch. When there are so may negative and heartbreaking updates on AITA, its lovely to read something positive!", "Respectfully, the \u201cnever go to bed angry\u201d advice isn\u2019t always good. I\u2019ve been married 16 years and my parents nearly 50- we all agree that sometimes it\u2019s better to pause the argument and go to bed- the next morning, cooler/calmer heads prevail and things didn\u2019t get said when we were tired and heated. I\u2019d rather us go to bed angry and resolve it in the morning than have anyone say something they\u2019d regret. My husband is the same way. Usually things look much less fraught in the morning. \n\nEvery couple and person is different. My best advice is for a couple to learn how they each handle conflict and come up with their own \u201cconflict management plan\u201d. If they have an understand of how they want to address disagreements, it\u2019ll be easier to manage fairly when they happen. \n\nI\u2019m glad your plan works for you! \ud83d\ude00", "FOR WHAT? Wanting his wife to have a good time on her wedding day?", "Gonna vent for a second.  I can\u2019t stand people who behave like your mother did.  I work with people who don\u2019t seem like they were ever taught the meaning of \u201cno\u201d and only respect boundaries once they find out the consequences of over stepping them.  The worst part for me is that these people are older, some are even grandparents.  That\u2019s not how things should be.  I hate being the only adult around children twice my age.  Christ I need a new job. \n\nAnyway~ I\u2019m very glad your wife\u2019s dad didn\u2019t make an appearance, that the wedding went off without a hitch, that your wife was able to enjoy it, and that your family owned up to their shit.  Congratulations on your wedding day!", "Congratulations on marrying a very gracious and forgiving woman. It\u2019s frightening that your mother is a psychologist. If she treats her own family this way, I can\u2019t imagine how many of her clients\u2019 lives her arrogance has ruined. I hope you\u2019ve at least seen who your mother really is and will keep her at arms length after such a huge trust violation.", "Glad everything worked out. I definitely think sitting down after all of this is done with and setting out the hard limit that certain boundaries have reason. Your mom being a therapist should know better. Even if she is skilled in family reunification, she is not OP's wife's therapist. \n\nIn therapy the patient sets the pace, not the therapist. \n\nI hope your mom respects her boundaries in the future.", "She\u2019s much more forgiving than I would be!", "I was thinking the same thing. If this woman is this much of an arrogant know-it-all with her family, imagine how many of her clients lives she\u2019s ruined bc she \u201cknew best\u201d. If I were Op wife I\u2019d never resume anything but a superficial relationship with her. She\u2019s much more forgiving than I would be!", "Congrats on the marriage.", ">Respectfully, the \u201cnever go to bed angry\u201d advice isn\u2019t always good.\n\nLol, I agree with this! My husband and I have been married over 20 years, and when we first got married, that's the advice I heard from so many people! So we tried it. But, I get exhausted when we argue, and we would try to work things out until 2 AM sometimes, and we'd just get more and more frustrated. And I'm NOT a reasonable person when I'm exhausted; I'm sorry but that's the truth. Finally we admitted to each other that \"don't go to bed angry\" didn't work for us, so we would just go to bed even if we were really angry, and things always seemed better in the morning. \n\nSo yeah, we learned that you don't have to finish an argument before bedtime, lol! At least not for us. Maybe it works for other people, though, so just take it with a grain of salt.", "Same for my husband & i! Lol.  \n\nWe argue & then we get all cuddled up like 'love you, you suck a lil bit tho'. Usually all is well by the next day cause we were either grumpy the night before, or after a few hours we realize what ever it was isn't worth being angry.", "Congratulations!!\n\nI would only invite one sibling out of seven to any of my families events. I built my own safe family and they each are bombs set to destroy. I\u2019m done being destroyed. \n\nI\u2019m proud of your wife. Finding the strength to stand up to a MIL is impressive. Although mine hasn\u2019t stepped foot in my house since she complained about coffee cups in my sink!", "Congratulations. Positive update. Still NTA.", "Congrats. I love that that that you and wife were tough when needed, yet wise and logical and didn't go nuclear (even though justified). And you had your spouse's back. That rare in this forum. You both have class.", "you did the right thing! this is absolutely something my dad tried to do with my brother and his wife and now they don't talk. because my dad picked the side of a man he never knew and invited him into my brother and his wife's lives especially now that they have kids\n\ni'm happy y'all could reconnect. like it makes me so happy and a little envious tbh. i only wish for the same maturity from your mom to my parents :(", "Congratulations and your wife is truly an amazing person!", "The original disturbs me in two ways.\n\n1. The obvious. A child going NC with a parent is a big deal. The fact that someone else thinks they know better is mind-blowing. As someone from a healthy family that all stay in contact, it still blows my mind that some people think that because their family is great, everyone elses should be too, and any conflict is wrong. \n2. I don't see this mentioned a lot, but personally I HATE when someone decides that a reunion like this should be at some big event. Even if, god forbid, MIL was correct, reuniting fiancee and her father at her wedding is a TERRIBLE idea. Why on earth would you risk ruining an important day/occassion with something like this. IF OPs wife ever decides to meet her father, it should be a random afternoon catch up for coffee in a cafe, or meet at a park, or something low key like that. Not some major family get together, let alone her bloody wedding...", "I would ask her to review the ethics part of her training and {old} license.", "Ridiculous and if she was still practicing, enough to get your mother's license revoked. What if there was physical violence? There's tons of stuff your arrogant mother didn't even consider because she \"know better\" what your wife wanted that your wife did. Such a HUGE boundary to overstep. Does your mother really UNDERSTAND what she did or did she just apologize to keep the peace? I need to know more about your mother and her actions. NTA.", "Yep. My husband and I threw out \"don't got to bed early\" within the first year. It just means you continue arguing with less and less logic and more and more emotion. Go to sleep, and 9 times out of 10 you're both willing to compromise by morning.", "My mum sleeps apart from dad because he sometimes kicks and snores. Although our family cat (back in the day) would follow her to the spare room and snore defeating the purpose LOL", "The main times we've slept apart was due to my pain issues. I found sleeping in the recliner more comfortable. But then we got an awesome electric bed. It's a split queen so we each have half that can adjust to pretty much any position we want. It was a saviour!", "The fact that your fiancee insisted on letting your mother come to the wedding after what happened speaks very well of her character.", "So glad to hear this. Congratulations on your wedding! \n\nReading your post I chuckled at your fianc\u00e9/wife treating it like a spy mission. Operation Wedded Bliss. I got a visual of a woman in a dark wig, trench coat, beret and huge sunglasses creeping around corners and setting booby traps around a fine dining restaurant and demanding passwords at the front door.\n\nApologies are easy, learning from them is more challenging and real change takes work. I truly hope your mother is looking to change her perception of what\u2019s right. I think she bears watching for a few years.\n\nWishing you a long and happy marriage.", "This! I can\u2019t count how many arguments escalated unnecessarily because my partner and I were determined to follow that rule. So many sleepless nights and hurt feelings because we couldn\u2019t let anything go and got less and less reasonable as we got more tired. I\u2019m so glad we eventually learned to put things off til morning. 8 years together and we just keep getting better with time.", "Congrats on your happy day! What a great save you made. And... Did the father show up on the 18th?", "Dude past the first husband test with flying colors", "Congrats on the wedding and glad that you guys and your family were able to mend the relationships", "Agreed. Honestly most of our arguments have happened before bed because we were both tired and not thinking clearly. We go to bed angry-ish but wind up cuddling in our sleep or before. Morning is always a sleepy kiss, and we forget it or address it with mutual sorries and move on. If it\u2019s a bigger issue we sit down and talk about our feelings. But they\u2019re both from a place of apologizing and how we can do better.\n\nRarely (my husband has more of a temper where I can be more cold when mad) I\u2019ll just kind of walk away from him and let him cool down. He always comes back apologetic and I come back from mine apologizing for being cold.\n\nWe argue from time to time but it never lasts longer than a day at the very most."]}
