I of course said yes. My wife didn't seem to have a problem with it originally either but now there's issues. My wife has sensory overload problems. Mostly when it comes to sounds. Anything loud sets her off. The dog isn't inherently loud but I mean.. when she eats, drinks or even licks herself repetitively, it absolutely drives my wife insane and has been since about a week in (she's been here for 2 weeks). \n\nThe other issue is that if my wife tries removing herself from the situation, the dog immediately follows her (she really likes my wife) and will try her damnedest to be as close to my wife as physically possible. Where she of course starts licking herself and further pissing my wife off. I've attempted to intervene and get the dog away from her but it doesn't take long for the dog to get back to wherever my wife is and at this point, even the sounds of the dogs nails clicking against the floor behind her is setting my wife off in a fit of rage. \n\nYesterday the dog was sitting on the floor beside the bed and immediately started licking herself. She is definitely an excessive licker. My wife started losing her cool completely and said she \"can't fucking do this anymore\" and said something about \"I would rather throw myself from the nearest building rather than be around this fucking dog\" and asked me to bring the dog somewhere else for the remainder of the time that my sister is healing. My mom would take the dog but she's elderly and in a wheelchair and while the dog isn't rambunctious, I don't feel comfortable taking the chance. No one else wants to take her. So I said no, and that we wouldn't have her much longer anyhow. She basically told me to go fuck myself and that this was a deal breaker for her and I wouldn't see her again. She packed up and left, to her mother's. I'm being told I'm in the wrong.\n\nETA: getting a bit of feedback based off the assumption that I asked my wife if we could take the dog. Since I want unbiased feedback.. I will say I didn't ask my wife. My sister called while I was at work and I agreed to take the dog without consulting her. My wife simply didn't appear to have an issue until recently.", "created_utc": 1685452685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vq3oo/aita_for_refusing_to_bring_my_sisters_dog/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That way, your wife can be in her own house.", "YTA.  You chose your sisters dog over your wife.  \n\nI don't blame you for wanting to help your sister, but once you saw how it was impacting your wife you should have put your wife first and figured something out.", "OK. YTA.\n\nYou open your post by saying that you agreed to have the dog for \"4-6 weeks\" and \"your wife didn't seem to have a problem with it\". If you're going to agree to board someone's dog for that long, you need to have a conversation with her first. Not just assume that it will be OK, or \"she didn't seem to mind\".\n\nBefore you agree to board the dog, you needed to talk to your wife, and you both needed to agree to house the dog for this long.\n\nAlso you're an asshole because you know your wife has sensory issues, and you brought a noisy animal in to her safe space.\n\nThird, does your home not have doors? Seems like you had plenty of opportunity to shut you and the dog in one room, and let your wife have some space, but you appear to be behaving like a selfish asshole, so you didn't do that - you just let the dog terrorize your wife, because it likes her.\n\nNewsflash: I don't care who the dog likes. You're not married to the dog. You're married to your wife.", "Info: have you attempted to find alternative solutions to your wife's issues, or did you leave it alone until it was too late to deal with the matter in a reasonable way? \n\nAlso, did you inform your sister you were having problems with the dog?\n\nEDIT: OP is TA, he didn't even ask for his wife's consent before promising his sister to take care of the dog.", "INFO: Did you and your wife talk before you brought the dog into your home?  Did she freely agree to have the dog for that length of time?\n\nYou\u2019re not looking good either way, but if she didn\u2019t consent to issuing the dog for an extended time in the first place, it makes you significantly worse.", "YTA\n\nYou ran your wife out of her home. \n\nYou didn't even ask your wife before taking on a pet for 4-6 weeks. You created an uncomfortable environment for your wife at home. Even after she discussed her displeasure, you ignored it and basically told her that her opinions in her own home don't matter. You're picking someone else's dog over your wife's comfort in her own home.\n\nYour mom is willing to take the dog, it's not ideal but if you care to save your marriage let the dog stay there and go over there to walk and care for the dog.", "YTA. I don't have sensory issues, but there are two or three sounds that make me want to stab people in the face. It doesn't matter that the dog sounds don't bother you, your WIFE has told you that having the dog is causing her great distress. And you basically told her to \"calm down\" and put up with it.\n\n\nRight now, you're choosing to live with the dog instead of your wife.", "Edit: YTA- You didn't consult your wife.  Dude, you suck.  It's still not the dog's fault.  A kennel for a couple weeks is an option, or maybe doggy daycare.  Maybe a pet sitter who can watch the dog at their house.  \n\nOriginal:    Yes, this situation sucks.  However, you can't abandon the dog while your sister is recovering.  \n\nHave you or your wife tried mitigating the situation? Can your wife wear headphones or noise canceling headphones?  Can she go in another room and shut the door?  Can she go outside away from the dog? Do you have a fenced-in yard where the dog can go out for a little bit? Can you take the dog on more frequent walks to give your wife some alone time?  Maybe the compromise is your wife staying with her mom for a couple of weeks until the dog goes back home.  \n\nI'm not saying any of these compromises are ideal, but this situation is temporary.\n\nI do have one question though, did you ask your wife before agreeing to take the dog.

Maybe you and the dog can hang out in a separate room.", "YTA for not talking to your wife about having the licky monster (dog) for an extended period of time beforehand.  I'd be finding a kennel the dog could stay in for the rest of your dog sitting time asap, and paying for it yourself.  You cocked up, make it right.\n\nI love dogs in general, but sometimes their behaviour gets my goat in a huge way.\n\nKudos to you for defending your wife in the comments to people who can't read though.", "YTA\n\nyou took the dog without consulting your wife, I understand that you've been thinking about helping your sister, but that's not the best move to begin with.\n\nYour wife tried to suck it up, for your sake or for her SIL, I don't know but to appear not having an issue is far from giving an OK.\n\nYour wife has her own health issues that conflict with taking care for the dog. She reached her limit and it was now YOUR responsibility to find a solution to the dog problem. And your response was to suck it up, when that's what she already did until now. \n\nWith the open heart surgery of your sister, I think the four to six weeks healing time until she's fit enough to take over the care for her dog is optimistic. So your wife not knowing WHEN her home will become a safe space for her again, if ever, she made the right call to say that's a deal breaker.", "So with the comment that you never asked your wife if she was okay with a dog for 1.5 weeks, YTA. The added sensory issues is a nightmare. Why aren't you just locking the dog out of your room? Have dog free zones at the cery least, I'm sure you have doors.", "My vote is YTA.\n\nNot asking first off, not good.  However, even if wife agreed, the dog licking is fucking annoying.  Even you said it is excessive.  It is loud & gross and I don't usually have problems with noises and no sensory issues.  So something's got to give. Has your sister tried options from the vet?  Is it stress/nervousness? I mean, I would try some chill pills (what we called the meds we got for our dog for travel & fireworks) or some natural alternatives - if vet approved of course. Crate, headphones, keeping the dog out of the sleeping rooms.  All reasonable work arounds. \n\nAlthough...your wife is past the point of trying shit.  She TOLD you it was the dog vs her, and you weren't hearing her.  I absolutely do not blame her telling you to fuck off.  Its seems you heard that loud and clear, and not all the other times she told you that she couldn't do this anymore. \n\nSis needs to find a different arrangement.

I mean, what would she have done had you said no in their first place? Maybe your sister could keep her at her house, or your mom's, if a dog walker came in a few times a day to feed and walk her? Otherwise she's going to need to board her long-term.", "YTA. It\u2019s horrific to change your home environment so drastically, especially when your wife has sensory issues, without discussing it first. Now, upon being told the level of distress, it\u2019s your responsibility to find a way to solve the problem. You could live in your sister\u2019s house with the dog. You could keep the dog with you all the time, on a leash, and pay for dog day care while you\u2019re at work. Any solution at this point won\u2019t be easy (and probably not cheap), but you caused this by agreeing without talking with your wife.\n\nEdited to fix typo.", "Of course he leaves out important info on the post....here ya go Reddit....\n\n\n>My wife told me to go fuck myself, not my sister.

Be honest and tell her the truth. You didn't even consult your wife and there are major health issues involved now. You drove your wife from your home and possibly your marriage.\n\nYour sister can arrange for alternate care and hire a damn dog sitter or walker for the duration left. YOU ALSO GAVE YOUR VOWS TO YOUR WIFE....which you are breaking now OP!!\n\nFor people saying his wife needs to get over it---- she has sensory issues. Her home is her sanctuary.....the ONE safe space you have to control the environment to deal with sensory issues..... And her husband just wrecked that space and is STILL actively choosing to do so.... So NO...saying  she needs to get over it or go therapy etc....those are all ignorant comments.\n\nRETURN THE DOG. Immediately. Have an honest conversation with your wife.  Be supportive of her and listen.", "YTA. Did you ask you wife before you agreed to this? The solution is simple. Pay to board the dog at a kennel or have a month long separation from your wife that could become permanent and rather expensive.", "YTA you absolutely should have asked your wife before offering to take care of your sister's dog.

If you\u2019re in the NYC area, I know a good place. \n\nThere are also easy boundaries to set with dogs that as an experienced pet carer I have used on dogs that are not mine and work really well. Things like speaking to them in simple language without all the extras we use in everyday English. That means you are saying mostly words she knows and she\u2019ll pay attention and listen better. Dogs also 100% understand and value good manners vs being rude. Trust me I was shocked too but holy crap does it work. When you label certain things as rude, she\u2019ll start to get the hint. Saying things like \u201c[dogs name] no follow [wif\u2019s name]. Is rude. No rude dogs\u201d. When she responds to that positively then you say \u201cOh old girl! Such good manners!\u201d And for extra credit, when she does a good manners thing, praised for it. It\u2019s worked on every dog I\u2019ve looked after since I discovered it.

I of course said yes. My wife didn't seem to have a problem with it originally either but now there's issues. My wife has sensory overload problems. Mostly when it comes to sounds. Anything loud sets her off. The dog isn't inherently loud but I mean.. when she eats, drinks or even licks herself repetitively, it absolutely drives my wife insane and has been since about a week in (she's been here for 2 weeks). \n\nThe other issue is that if my wife tries removing herself from the situation, the dog immediately follows her (she really likes my wife) and will try her damnedest to be as close to my wife as physically possible. Where she of course starts licking herself and further pissing my wife off. I've attempted to intervene and get the dog away from her but it doesn't take long for the dog to get back to wherever my wife is and at this point, even the sounds of the dogs nails clicking against the floor behind her is setting my wife off in a fit of rage. \n\nYesterday the dog was sitting on the floor beside the bed and immediately started licking herself. She is definitely an excessive licker. My wife started losing her cool completely and said she \"can't fucking do this anymore\" and said something about \"I would rather throw myself from the nearest building rather than be around this fucking dog\" and asked me to bring the dog somewhere else for the remainder of the time that my sister is healing. My mom would take the dog but she's elderly and in a wheelchair and while the dog isn't rambunctious, I don't feel comfortable taking the chance. No one else wants to take her. So I said no, and that we wouldn't have her much longer anyhow. She basically told me to go fuck myself and that this was a deal breaker for her and I wouldn't see her again. She packed up and left, to her mother's. I'm being told I'm in the wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
