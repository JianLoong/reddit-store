Jack lives with my parents as his dad is a massive piece of shit.\n\nI\u2019m staying with my parents for a bit to help out and while I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve noticed that my dad rarely interacts with Jack. When he does talk to Jack, it seems like he has these walls up. I understand that it may be hard since Jack is an exact copy of his mom, but treating him like he isn\u2019t there isn\u2019t correct in my opinion.\n\nThe morning before last, I woke up to Jack crying and my parents arguing. \n\nWhat happened was that Jack was playing with his toys while my parents were sitting on the couch. He was playing playing pretend with three action figures and in his game, one of the three died. Then he made the others console each other and he repeated some things that were said to him when his own mom died. \n\nI did some research when my sister passed to find out how to move forward regarding Jack and it mentioned things to look out for and things that were normal. It was mentioned that reenacting stuff with toys is normal. I even double checked with a therapist. I explained all these things to my parents. \n\nMy dad I guess forgot and was all like \u201cwhat the hell are you doing!?\u201d My mom remembered what I told her and told my dad to leave him alone but my dad found Jack\u2019s way of playing \u201csuper weird and messed up\u201d and they started arguing. My dad even suggested that Jack may be a sociopath (he didn\u2019t say it outright though).\n\nI told my mom to take Jack out for a bit and after she left, my dad said he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into him. I guess he realized he overreacted. I just felt terrible for Jack who had to hear everything so instead of comforting my dad like usual, I told him \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you either. I didn\u2019t want to go there but do you think -sister- would be happy with how you\u2019re treating her son?\u201c\n\nMy dad got teary eyed and said I had no right to bring up my sister. He said that I\u2019m guilt tripping him and he also said that he never thought I\u2019d stoop so low. I told my dad he should be ashamed of himself and he got frustrated, said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not acting that great after my daughter just died\u201d and walked off.\n\nI don\u2019t think I was wrong to say what I did, but I do feel bad. My parents had my sister when they were teenagers and my dad was especially close to her. He definitely took her death the hardest.

Your sister would be thankful.", "NTA.  You all lost someone, and he needs to treat his grandson with the compassion he is asking for.", "NTA. \n\nYour dad sounds like he victimized himself though. Your points were legitimate and he really needs to check his behavior. Grief and losing a daughter is not an excuse for verbally abusing a child. Though I can understand that, in the heat of things, you can say things you don\u2019t mean.\n\nGo to your dad and tell him that the best thing he can do is to apologize to Jack, and talk with him about their mom/daughter. What they miss and stuff\u2026 conversations like that with a four year old can be so healing\u2026 maybe he can even play with Jack. That would be major helpful for Jack as well.", "NTA. Yes, your dad is grieving, but taking out his grief on other people, especially the kid, is not okay. And it sounds like that's what he's doing.", "NTA. It sounds like you were kind in being direct with him. He needed to hear it.", "NTA. Your Dad needs the reality check.", "NTA. This wasn't pointless cruelty. You needed to get something important across to him, and it wasn't getting across with gentler methods. \n\nYour father is a grown man, and although he has lost his daughter and that's a terrible thing, he has all the resources of a grown man to handle it. Your nephew is four, and he has lost his entire world, the one parent in all of creation who loved him and took care of him. There's no contest. Your nephew needs to be protected and cared for, and have his needs met first of all. Your dad can do his own grieving in ways which don't hurt the child your sister left in his care.", "NTA. your dad needs therapy as well as Jack. Perhaps just everyone needs therapy.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like your dad knows he screwed up, and while you were right in what you said, it was a bit brutal for a parent who has just lost a child. People who have lost children (adult or not) are dealing with unimaginable grief. Processing that grief will take time.  And he is now responsible for his grandson. He probably wouldn't have it any other way, but he hasn't parented a young child for a while. \n\nGrief counselling for your dad (and Jack!) would be ideal. If your dad apologizes to Jack and they talk about your sister (when they are both ready), hopefully they can repair their bond.\n\nI doubt it will help your nephew if your dad spirals in his grief. Guilt trips aren't good for anyone.", "Nta.

He is the adult in the relationship -- if he can't handle the grief, he should get therapy.\n\nWhile your father may eventually get his act together, his foul behaviour towards Jack is going to live lasting scars in Jack's life.

I get that he is grieving the loss of his daughter, but his living grandchild should be his top priority. You are protecting you sister's child, as she would want.\n\nI'm sorry for you family's loss.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth is really painful. As a parent, I can\u2019t imagine losing a child and the pain it brings. I do know if something happened to me and my husband, I would want my children treated like they were a daughter of the people raising them. There is no correct way to grieve and maybe this was a little harsh but it really sounds like he needed to hear it.

Yeah, your dad is struggling with something extremely difficult but it sounds like he is not processing it in a healthy way. It is okay to talk about your sister. Yeah you can't pull out the dead sister card on every opportunity but in this case it was very reasonable.", "NAH. I think you all need to give each other some grace. Your sister recently died. Jack is recently orphaned. Everyone is adjusting to a new dynamic while dealing with grief. People will make mistakes. It\u2019s ok to say something if you are concerned. But it is also ok to just try to treat each other with patience and kindness right now.", "Yeah, just want to emphasize the importance of the dad apologizing and explaining his feelings to Jack. Please, I work with children in a professional therapy setting (this is reddit so that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say) and repairing that bond is so important. Especially considering Jacks circumstances. Just please make this happen. You have no idea the risks (of all kinds) for Jack if he doesn\u2019t find a safe/secure/reliable attachment to someone, and additionally a male figure of this sort is important for long term development. Just please, I hope OP reads this and takes it seriously, this is not a joke.", "I agree with all this, except the victimized part. \n\nI think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to cry and be distraught after hearing something that hurtful. It\u2019s true, but still hurtful. And eve as a grown man he is allowed to have feelings. He doesn\u2019t somehow lose that right. \n\nI think it\u2019s a bit toxic to immediately assume emotional manipulation.

But I draw the line when someone starts being abusive of an innocent child.\n\nGood for OP for calling his dad out over his behavior to his grandson.", "Absolutely NTA. You spoke a hard truth to him.

Sometimes grief makes people stupid and thoughtless and so wrapped up in their own pain they cannot see anyone else\u2019s.\n\nI would have a soft talk with dad, though, and encourage him to search out a grief support group.
