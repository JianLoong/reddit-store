A couple days ago we were all at my parent's house for dinner and my step dad was asking how fatherhood changed life for my husband since we're the most recent parents of the family, with my BIL chipping in the conversation while me and my mom were heating up my sister's kids food, so we were all in the kitchen. My step brother comes in while we're laughing about diaper blowout stories and my husband is like \"I can't believe how much a tiny baby can go man\" and my step brother starts bragging that he never changed a diaper in his life. \nMy BIL immediately goes inside the pantry (his default response to my step brother talking about fatherhood or football is to pretend he's busy with something), my step dad is like \"wait, never?? How did you manage that?\" and my step brother says he could never, he can't even think about it without shuddering and that it's definitely his wife's job and always will be. \n\nI was really annoyed at this already mostly because his wife was just telling me and my sister she feels overwhelmed a lot lately because she wanted to go back to work just to have some time for herself and was feeling guilty about getting a nanny, but my husband said something like oh wow, poor your wife man, and my step brother said \"nah, she likes it.\" And I just snapped.\n\nI asked him why he couldn't change his babies diapers and said that it's not that hard to learn, to which he answered that it's not about learning, he's smart enough to change a diaper, but the thought of it just makes him uncomfortable and repeated that it's a woman's job anyway. \n\nNow my mom is saying that it isn't, but I ask him \"why does it make you uncomfortable, are you a perv? It's your own baby's pee and poo, what's the big deal about it?\" \n\nWell, he got offended and left the kitchen, my step dad said that was an unnecessary comment to me, my mom said something about you say stupid things you get stupid answers, and my BIL gave me a thumbs up (from the pantry). \n\nI kinda regret saying it, because it is a shitty thing to say, but I also don't want to apologize because I agree with my mom, he said a stupid thing and got a stupid answer, but I could have been a better person about it, just because he's a sexist ass doesn't mean I also have to be a dick..

How in the world did he ever find someone to marry him? Your poor SIL. It sounds to me like your step-bro could use a good talking to. Your step-dad is just enabling him by not calling him out on his bullshit and giggling at his stupidity. INFO: Is your step-dad like this at all? I mean, where did your step-bro learn this type of mentality? How long has your step-brother been in your family? If anything, his dad needs to put him in his place and I'd ask him to do it sooner than later so your step-bro doesn't start spewing his misogynistic crap in front of the kids when they're old enough to understand.  I'd also ask your SIL if she's okay because I wouldn't be surprised if he treats her like shit behind closed doors.", "NTA.  I might not have called him a perv, but I definitely would've attacked his \"masculinity\" at being uncomfortable at changing a diaper.  If he's going to brag about being sexist, then he should expect some pushback.", "NTA. It is clearly time someone called him out for his bullshit. Does he think neglecting to care for his own child is somehow admirable or manly?", "Lol. No, NTA. You met him where he's at. If no one else will put him in his place, it's fine if you do. \n\nI know there's the whole \"when they go low, we go high\" mentality out there, but sometimes, nah, people need you to go lower to show them how crummy they are.", "Not even close to TA, what a gross human", "I mean he Seems like a shitty father and husband and generally an awkward person, But Why did you call him a pervert? It makes No sense at all?", "Nta. You are ok", "NTA\n\nImagine being a lazy waste of space husband/father who also happens to be sexist, and then being proud of it. \n\nI'd have him prove he really is \"smart enough\" to change a diaper. Bet he fails and needs rescuing.\n\nFeel bad for your SIL and their baby. Imagine how he's like at home! *shudder*", "i think you actually handled this really well and called him on his bs. NTA by any means.", "NTA. It was time someone called this dude out.", "It was a shitty thing to say but he is an arsehole", "NTA\n\nthe guy is a huge AH. Sometimes you need to stand your ground. He's so insecure in his masculinity he must have tiny hands.\n\nJust be careful not to fight his' wife battles. His wife needs to stand up for herself at one point.", "ESH.  He is a huge asshole, especially to his wife, but suggesting he was a pervert in connection with his child is unwarranted, and a major escalation.  You exeeded him in asholerly in that moment, even if he is overall a bigger asshole.", "Little bit YTA. Conflating his laziness and sexism with being a pervert wasn't really appropriate. You could try and convince his wife to stand up for herself more and put pressure on your stepbrother to help out. How is your relationship with his wife now after you call her husband a pervert.", "NTA. Having three daughters myself, I never once thought I wouldn\u2019t be changing diapers, rocking them to sleep, waking up in the middle of the night to feed them or get them back to sleep. To be completely honest, when other men say shit like that, it pisses me off too. What kind of man doesn\u2019t take care of their kids? \n\nI\u2019d say the only thing that missed here was the actual word \u201cperv\u201d. I\u2019d think lazy shit or crap father would have been a more adequate terminology, but you\u2019re not TA for calling out his bull crap.", "NTA. You know, people like your step brother needs to be offended every once in a while, just to remind him that he offends other people on a regular basis. I agree with your mom, and with people like your step dad covering for him, no wonder he stays the way he does. \n\nSo, don\u2019t apologize to him. Let his ego remain bruised. At the least, his wife needs to know that someone is on her side should she ever decide she has had enough.", "NTA. What a total dick. Perv might not have been the best choice but he did need calling out.", "YTA. This is exactly why Daycares in America don't want male Teachers. People THINK THIS. It isn't a snap back or a joke to a large percentage of people. Having a male around kids is considered \"dumb\" or \"na\u00efve\" at best.\n\nHe is a sexist. But you are worse. Even as a joke it comes off as unhinged to imply he wants to molest his own child.", "Tiny YTA here, you don't wallow down in the mud with these types of people.  You don't attack him for being a perv, that was out of line.  But do attack him for being a sexist.  That is fair game.", "YTA for calling him a perv he\u2019s definitely just a deadbeat loser not a perv, terms matter here and could see why others would find your terminology confusing \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\nHe sounds insufferable", "I mean objectively yes, YTA for baselessly accusing your step brother of being a sexual predator towards his own child. \n\nEverything else, NTA.", "YTA \n\nThat comment was out of line. Also I don't take posts serious where the first paragraph is only there to put the other one into a bad light, without contributing to the story.", "Your step brother is an asshole,  but that's between him and his partner. \n\nYTA for implying he finds his children sexually desirable 100%", "NTA but you did kinda sink to his level with the perv comment. Calling him a perv for not cleaning diapers is a strange passive aggressive comment. No shame in calling him out, but you should have done it in a more dignified manner. Like calmly telling him its not fair for his women to do all the work, and its just as much his responsibility (preferably saying this in front of her as well so she can hear this).", "ESH- You would have been totally in line right up until the perv comment, which doesn't seem justified given the information. Step brother is a misogynist.", "YTA.", "The insecurity from your step brother is just seething out.\n\nNTA", "NTA - as for it being \"an unnecessary comment\" I disagree.  It was a spot-on, much needed AND appreciated comment.  He can be a dick, but then he needs to be expected to be treated like a dick.  That's how it works.  (Go BIL!  At least there is him).", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure that your SIL found it quite uncomfortable to birth his child.", "NTA.  Only off an apology once he apologizes to his wife for being such an asshole.", "NTA--you're a legend, OP, keep it up.", "Stepbrother deserved that and worse. NTA", "NTA but personally I would have gone with implying he wasn't man enough to change them rather than the perv direction (which is more personal and doesn't mess with his obviously huge ego).", "Masculinity so fragile it can't survive a diaper change.\nI would suggest that he's jealous of the size of baby.\n\nNta", "NTA. He's a weirdo, not you. That's his child he won't take care of, that's the thing he's bragging about. I would've said the same thing.
