A couple days ago we were all at my parent's house for dinner and my step dad was asking how fatherhood changed life for my husband since we're the most recent parents of the family, with my BIL chipping in the conversation while me and my mom were heating up my sister's kids food, so we were all in the kitchen. My step brother comes in while we're laughing about diaper blowout stories and my husband is like \"I can't believe how much a tiny baby can go man\" and my step brother starts bragging that he never changed a diaper in his life. \nMy BIL immediately goes inside the pantry (his default response to my step brother talking about fatherhood or football is to pretend he's busy with something), my step dad is like \"wait, never?? How did you manage that?\" and my step brother says he could never, he can't even think about it without shuddering and that it's definitely his wife's job and always will be. \n\nI was really annoyed at this already mostly because his wife was just telling me and my sister she feels overwhelmed a lot lately because she wanted to go back to work just to have some time for herself and was feeling guilty about getting a nanny, but my husband said something like oh wow, poor your wife man, and my step brother said \"nah, she likes it.\" And I just snapped.\n\nI asked him why he couldn't change his babies diapers and said that it's not that hard to learn, to which he answered that it's not about learning, he's smart enough to change a diaper, but the thought of it just makes him uncomfortable and repeated that it's a woman's job anyway. \n\nNow my mom is saying that it isn't, but I ask him \"why does it make you uncomfortable, are you a perv? It's your own baby's pee and poo, what's the big deal about it?\" \n\nWell, he got offended and left the kitchen, my step dad said that was an unnecessary comment to me, my mom said something about you say stupid things you get stupid answers, and my BIL gave me a thumbs up (from the pantry). \n\nI kinda regret saying it, because it is a shitty thing to say, but I also don't want to apologize because I agree with my mom, he said a stupid thing and got a stupid answer, but I could have been a better person about it, just because he's a sexist ass doesn't mean I also have to be a dick.. You see, I'm conflicted. Am I the asshole? \nAlso, sorry about the language.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I feel I need to clarify that I didn't accuse him OF being a perv, I asked if he was, and no I don't think he is one, I snapped and said probably said the nastiest thing that popped in my head.\n\nThat being said, I am reading every comment and appreciate every opinion, I came here for perspective because I feel everyone involved is too biased to give me a real answer.

I mean, where did your step-bro learn this type of mentality? How long has your step-brother been in your family? If anything, his dad needs to put him in his place and I'd ask him to do it sooner than later so your step-bro doesn't start spewing his misogynistic crap in front of the kids when they're old enough to understand.  I'd also ask your SIL if she's okay because I wouldn't be surprised if he treats her like shit behind closed doors.", "NTA.

Does he think neglecting to care for his own child is somehow admirable or manly?", "Lol. No, NTA. You met him where he's at. If no one else will put him in his place, it's fine if you do. \n\nI know there's the whole \"when they go low, we go high\" mentality out there, but sometimes, nah, people need you to go lower to show them how crummy they are.", "Not even close to TA, what a gross human", "I mean he Seems like a shitty father and husband and generally an awkward person, But Why did you call him a pervert?

Having three daughters myself, I never once thought I wouldn\u2019t be changing diapers, rocking them to sleep, waking up in the middle of the night to feed them or get them back to sleep.
