My friends and I also had a little falling out mid 2023 and this was our first get together after the said fall out. \n\nMy aunt (and her family), who lives next door, dropped by and saw my friends. A few moments later, my cousin (F30), who has autism, came and invited herself to my get together. I\u2019m not exactly sure what her level in the autism spectrum is but she behaves as a kid, like a 6 year old and not 30 years old. She cannot not function as an adult (e.g she cannot have a job, did not went to proper schooling, etc.) My aunt raised her as a spoiled brat, who gives her everything and does not correct her behavior. My cousin would throw tantrums in public places and would scream whenever things don\u2019t go her way. You can\u2019t also scold her since she\u2019ll just be a menace and would make a scene. \n\nA little background: when I was a teen (around 14-15), my aunt would often force me to babysit her. Whenever I would go to some place (like malls, churches, etc.) my aunt would tell me to bring my cousin with me. At some point, it got tiring as a kid myself, I really don\u2019t want to take care of someone who\u2019s older than me yet behaves like a child. Honestly, her kid is not my problem. \n\nSo when my cousin showed up at my little get together (which may be due to my aunt\u2019s doing), I was annoyed and gave her a couple snacks and sent her home. My aunt was annoyed at me, saying that I should be \u201cmore understanding\u201d and that my cousin needs social interaction too.\n\nAgain, I fail to see how that is my problem.
