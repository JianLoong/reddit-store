My friends and I also had a little falling out mid 2023 and this was our first get together after the said fall out. \n\nMy aunt (and her family), who lives next door, dropped by and saw my friends. A few moments later, my cousin (F30), who has autism, came and invited herself to my get together. I\u2019m not exactly sure what her level in the autism spectrum is but she behaves as a kid, like a 6 year old and not 30 years old. She cannot not function as an adult (e.g she cannot have a job, did not went to proper schooling, etc.) My aunt raised her as a spoiled brat, who gives her everything and does not correct her behavior. My cousin would throw tantrums in public places and would scream whenever things don\u2019t go her way. You can\u2019t also scold her since she\u2019ll just be a menace and would make a scene. \n\nA little background: when I was a teen (around 14-15), my aunt would often force me to babysit her. Whenever I would go to some place (like malls, churches, etc.) my aunt would tell me to bring my cousin with me. At some point, it got tiring as a kid myself, I really don\u2019t want to take care of someone who\u2019s older than me yet behaves like a child. Honestly, her kid is not my problem. \n\nSo when my cousin showed up at my little get together (which may be due to my aunt\u2019s doing), I was annoyed and gave her a couple snacks and sent her home. My aunt was annoyed at me, saying that I should be \u201cmore understanding\u201d and that my cousin needs social interaction too.\n\nAgain, I fail to see how that is my problem.

If your cousin needs social interaction then your aunt needs to see to that. I don\u2019t think you did anything in the wrong here.", "NTA - if she needs social interaction then her mother should look into community resources, activities, and events for adults with autism. there are a lot of recreation leagues and other ways for your cousin to gain social interaction experience without it become an unpaid job of yours. my cousin is an adult who has severe autism and he is involved in a number of organized activities/sports/etc.!\n\nit was nice that you gave her snacks and i\u2019m sure when you sent her home that you were kind and friendly about that because it\u2019s clear that you have a lot of love for your cousin & that your issue is with her mother, not her. don\u2019t let your aunt gaslight you into sharing her responsibilities as the parent of your cousin.", "NTA. Your aunt is just trying to use you as a babysitter. If she wants your cousin to be social she needs to set up interactions with other special needs adults for her.", "NTA your cousin's lack of socializing isn't your problem and she wasn't invited to your party. Your aunt can deal with her spoiled kid herself (lock the door next time)", "NTA\n\nThe aunt is the ah here for poorly raising her kid and enabling their behavior, the cousin wasnt invited", "NTA. Your aunt doesn't get to invite her daughter to your gatherings and it was incredibly rude of her to try to foist her on you. Autistic or not you aren't not your cousins keeper", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is rude and entitled. You don't invite your special needs child ro someone else's gathering, especially if said child is a physically grown adult adult with the mental age of a child who needs supervision.\n\nIf your cousin need social interaction its your aunts responsibility to find a group or org that can arrange that for her, there's nothing for you to be _understanding_ about.", "NTA tell your aunt to schedule play dates", "NTA and it\u2019s your aunt\u2019s job to provide social activities for your cousin, not yours.  It was manipulative of her to put you on the spot by sending your cousin over to join your event without your invitation or permission.", "NTA, as you have the right to see your friends on your own and to have a life of your own. It isn't your job to nursemaid your cousin and should never have been.  I can understand your aunt's perspective though, as she  obviously wants her daughter to have friends and to be included.  However, she was and is wrong to expect you to provide this. Could you suggest to your aunt that your cousin might benefit from going to a support group for autistic people? I am autistic and go to two such groups.", "There are organizations that host events for people such as your cousin. Your aunt is doing her a disservice by keeping her at home.

No reason to cause unnessary drama.", "NTA. Your aunt is foisting her off on you so she can get peace and quiet. It doesn't sound like your cousin should be wandering from house to house by herself.

You are not responsible for providing your cousin with opportunities for social interaction.  Her mother is.

Did your Aunt educationally and medically neglect your special needs cousin by not trying to get her educated or medically evaluated for what kind of education would best suit her?", "NTA. Her showing up was a misunderstanding, we pressume. You weren't mean, you gave her snacks and sent her on her merry way. From what you have written I take away that any ill will against your cousin on your part is due to your aunt. \n\nSince you mention that your cousin has autism, I would like to encourage a very precise way of using vocabulary about her. A \"tantrum\" is something you would not expect or tolerate in any adult, as it is something you can control, whereas people with autism sometimes have meltdowns for a number of reasons. \"Meltdowns\" are not something people with autism can control, so not something they should be blamed for. So, INFO: Are you sure that your cousin is having meltdowns in public, or could she be having meltdowns?", "To clarify: she went to kindergarten and middle school, did not go to high school but a school for kids with special needs for around three years or so. \n\nHope it provides more context!", "That flew straight over \ud83d\ude0f\nBut NTA.
