They've met twice and I was able to tell my gf wasn't enjoying the interaction. I had asked her about it afterwards and she just said that best friend seemed nice but wasn't the type of person she would normally be friends with. Gf has also met a few of my other friends and she had the same reaction towards them. Civil, but not overly interested. She still encourages me to hang out with them by myself when they come to town so it's worked out well so far.\nAnyway, I told my best friend that it would be better if she found another place to stay due to the bathroom layout.

If you don't feel comfortable with it then sure that's your boundary, but if you're turning her away because you THINK your girlfriend will not be okay with it without discussing it with said girlfriend, then that is an assumption on your part and it sounds like a cop out to some other issue to me.", "NTA you\u2019re respecting your gfs boundaries and if she is really your friend she wouldn\u2019t make a big fuss out of it.", "NTA.

She hasn't been able to previously as I had roommates at my old place. \nNow the thing is that the bathroom in my new apartment is an en suite and my gf (30F) isn't particularly fond of my best friend.

I don't see the ensuite bathroom as being an issue.  I don't see anything inappropriate here.\n\nWhat, to me, seems to be an issue is that your GF has had the same reaction to your best friend as well as a few other of your friends.  She's certainly entitled to bond (or not bond) with your friends, but this seems to be a red flag.  Maybe a precursor to other controlling behavior down the road.", "I am confused. If your gf liked your friend would you have said yes?\n\nI guess I don't understand why your gf, who doesn't live with you, would be uncomfortable with your friend sharing your bathroom just because she doesn't particularly like her.", "YTA to yourself. I had one relationship like this, and come to find out, she \n\n>wasn't enjoying the interaction\n\nbecause she was a narcissistic piece of work that wanted me all to herself.", "YTA and you should consider your relationship with your GF.", "NTA- I think you are very kind for thinking of your girlfriends feelings", "NTA but also not making the right call imo. No shade I\u2019m just saying from experience, that I made a lot of concessions to try & appease past partners & none of those relationships stuck anyways. I would\u2019ve had a better time hanging with my friends than trying to tip toe around the insecurities of relationships that didn\u2019t last. As long as there\u2019s no underlying romantic situation between you & that friend then I see no problem with them crashing as long as their presence isn\u2019t putting you out. Think about what you want & what you need, if you\u2019re afraid to ask for what you want/need in a relationship, it\u2019s time to reevaluate the relationship (I don\u2019t know your situation with your partner, it\u2019s just advice I wish my younger self had heard).", "Agreed. My partners have had friends I didn't like much. Even my friends have other friends I don't like. That's just the way these things go. She's known OP for about a year? Yeah, well, OP has had a life and social interactions before that, and those things are a part of the deal. Being passive aggressive about them is stupid and immature. \n\nOP doesn't have to let anyone stay for a night if that's not something he feels comfortable with, but I think it's a slippery slope. Letting your partner's behaviour or opinions dictate your friendships just isn't healthy.", "are you an incel or just illiterate? she gets along with them fine just doesn't want to be their friend herself. which is normal.", "Woah, I didn't say I was going to drop my best friend. I just told her she couldn't crash but I'm still grabbing dinner with her.\n\nAs for gf, the friends that she has met might be a little rowdier than she's used to. My friends and I used to party a lot, I've since calmed down. I think gf would get along better with my uni friends but she's not met them yet.", "But the gf didnt say anything ! \nI mean i pretty much hate my bf friends but if they had to stay at our home for one or two night, i would say yes even though i wouldnt be thrilled or the happiest\nWhat i mean is that her gf might be ok with that and he didn't even asked her", "I'm married for years, and my wife's comfort doesn't trump everything else. If she's being unreasonable,  i tell her and expect her to do the same for me. We still really care about each other.", "\"Honey from now on I don't want you to wear anything green ever again\" - \"Okay honey, your comfort trumps everything else\"\n\nYou, probably.", "She\u2019s not dictating anything. He didn\u2019t even ask her.", "damn, yeah a few others have pointed this out and I don't know if it makes a difference but gf has only met a few of my friends. We used to party a lot but I've since calmed down. My uni friends are probably more up her alley but she hasn't met them yet.", "But he hasn\u2019t even said anything to his partner! He is just assuming that she would have a problem. Just because she herself wouldn\u2019t be friends with her bf\u2019s bf, doesn\u2019t mean that she would be opposed to her crashing on the couch for couple of nights", "If you are not letting your friend stay over just because your girlfriend who does not live with you, doesn\u2019t mess well with your friend group, you are distancing your self. Can you never invite friends over just in case they will have to use the bathroom?

Don\u2019t understand the YTA. If you are in a relationship with someone, it is not appropriate, in my opinion, to have sleepovers with friends in one bed condos. Where is friend sleeping? If gf isn\u2019t comfortable (I wouldn\u2019t be either), I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. Just think of how you would feel in reverse. You could add some info about why your gf doesn\u2019t love your friends and that might give better context.", "Your uni friends so she doesn't care much for the rowdier more blue friends that probably more loyal and lay a bat to someone head for ya, but posh uni friends right her speed. Seem kinda hold her nose up at people", "Ofcourse we are not talking about some unethical or criminals acts for the comfort of a spouse.\n\nIn normal life circumstances, spouse's comfort trumps any other relationship.\nIt's ok for spouses to be a little unreasonable . I believe in cutting some slack.\nIf it bothers you, talk about it later but don't do something that is making your spouse uncomfortable at that time.", "Yes, i will give up green clothes immediately, it will calm her nerves and make her feel safe and valued.  And then I'll ask my wife why it bothered her, if we could do something together to address it.\nSuch demand would most likely be due irrational thoughts, we will address it together and if we can't, giving up green clothes for the sake of my wife is nothing much really.", "Glad youre open to input in a positive way.  I wouldnt shoot gf down just yet, but I would still keep tight ties with female best friend on this.\n\nGood Luck brother", "Hmmm..does she like any of your old friends? Why would she like only your Uni friends?", "Did you ask your gf if she was comfortable with best friend sleeping on your couch for a night?\n\nThe bathroom being in the bedroom isn\u2019t really cause for concern. You don\u2019t have an issue with male friends using the bathroom, right?\n\nNow I do think it\u2019s respectful of your relationship to ask your gf her comfort level & respond appropriately from there. But you didn\u2019t even give her the chance to say how she felt.", "Could you imagine telling your friend they can't use your bathroom bc it's in your bedroom and your girlfriend who doesn't even live there won't like it.", "*\"Yeah, friend...  sorry, can't use the bathroom because GF won't like it.  You'll just have to pee in a cup and throw it out of the window.\"*", "*might* not like it. He hasn\u2019t even talked to her about it, just assumed based on a single interaction"]}
