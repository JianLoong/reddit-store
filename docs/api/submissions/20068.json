She's certainly entitled to bond (or not bond) with your friends, but this seems to be a red flag.  Maybe a precursor to other controlling behavior down the road.", "I am confused.

No shade I\u2019m just saying from experience, that I made a lot of concessions to try & appease past partners & none of those relationships stuck anyways. I would\u2019ve had a better time hanging with my friends than trying to tip toe around the insecurities of relationships that didn\u2019t last. As long as there\u2019s no underlying romantic situation between you & that friend then I see no problem with them crashing as long as their presence isn\u2019t putting you out. Think about what you want & what you need, if you\u2019re afraid to ask for what you want/need in a relationship, it\u2019s time to reevaluate the relationship (I don\u2019t know your situation with your partner, it\u2019s just advice I wish my younger self had heard).", "Agreed.

Being passive aggressive about them is stupid and immature. \n\nOP doesn't have to let anyone stay for a night if that's not something he feels comfortable with, but I think it's a slippery slope.
