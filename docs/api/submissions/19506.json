Whenever we see each other we cuddle and give long hugs because since I am working, when I come to her house I will have her come to the parking lot, talk and then hug her hard before I go. \n\nFor reference, she\u2019s 19 and I\u2019m 21. She will be 20 at the end of the year. Yesterday my gf asked if we could hang out, she said she wanted to go to the Mall and wanted me there, however she never mentioned any friends coming along. I get to her house, she gets in and we pull up to the mall and I see a bunch of her friends waiting on her. She explains that we\u2019re all going shopping and I felt like I was third wheeling. I felt really disrespected. \n\nTrying not to ruin her day, I told her to hang out with them and I\u2019d come back when she was ready. I then decided to wait in the parking lot since I had nowhere to go in the area. I asked her not to take longer than 30 mins. 45 mins passes, and hour passes, I called my gf 37 times. No answer so now I\u2019m infuriated. She comes out of the mall, I\u2019m sweating bc it\u2019s 103 degrees and I pulled to the front of the mall, screamed for her to get the f in the car and I flipped off her friends as I sped off. \n\nMy gf won\u2019t respond to any of my texts after I dropped her off at the house, and I feel bad about how I reacted but at the time I was truly angry about the situation.", "created_utc": 1686407970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1461yyp/aita_for_screaming_at_my_gf_after_she_had_me/", "score": 225, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you know how little time that is? Probably takes five-ten minutes just to get to the first store they had in mind. \n\nAlso, you chose to wait in the car. She didn\u2019t have you waiting there. Yelling at her and flipping off her friends is not cool.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore.", "YTA. Also maybe get some help with anger management and communication while you\u2019re young. \n\nIt\u2019ll save you a lot of future trouble.", "YTA. and a controlling A for that matter. \" Go with your friends, but don't take any longer than 30 minutes ...\"\n\"  Call her 37 times in the span of 15 minutes  and flipped off her friends after yelling at her in public? damn i hope she runs. i hope she runs fast and far away from you", "YTA 1000%. \n\nListen, I get it. The plans as you understood them to be were disrupted by her friends being there. That\u2019s frustrating, and it would have merited a calm discussion of expectations afterwards. \n\nHOWEVER. Get the f- in the car? Flipping off her friends? Expecting them to only take 30 minutes in the mall? That\u2019s just wayyyy over the top, dude. You went from reasonably disappointed to controlling asshole in almost no time. You acted all out of proportion to the severity of the situation, and you do yourself a disservice by acting like the stereotypical \u2018abusive partner\u2019. Because that\u2019s what that behavior was. ABUSIVE. Reeeeally look into yourself for this. Is that the type of person you want to be? ABUSIVE? \n\nThis is the sort of thing that creates domestic violence stories. I know you\u2019ve heard about those. A few angry words and a hand-sign now, but it can and does rapidly descend from there. This is a wake up call for you. You DO NOT want to be that person.", "YTA are you serious? You waited not knowing how long it would take and not telling her before she went that youd just be in the car waiting?? Nobody meets their friends for 30 mins at a mall, nobody at all goes to a mall for only 30 mins. You expressed no interest in hanging out with her friends, and then you scream at her in public to \u201cf\u2014-ing get in the car\u201d and you only realize now thats a bad reaction???? It\u2019s understandable to be taken aback by not knowing her friends would be there but man wtf\n\nEdited to add glad you flipped her friends off too and they were there to see your reaction. Theyre probably texting her rn supporting her decision to ghost your a$$.", "YTA. You decided to stay there and be hot. That's on you. \n\nThat you called her 37 times or whatever in 45 minutes is unbelievable.\n\nThen you tell at her, flip her friends off? Yeah, massive overreaction.\n\nThe good nows is you shouldn't have to worry about her doing this to you again! I suspect she's now your ex-girlfriend and she just hasn't told you yet.", "YTA. You could've hung out with her or you could've gone home or elsewhere if that's the case. She didn't force you to wait you chose to wait. Then you flipped off her friends for no real reason.  \nOnly thing you deserve is to be single.", "YTA.  Most of the time if you\u2019re asking AITA for screaming at my gf it\u2019s gonna be yes, but I kept reading and sure enough, you got there and saw her friends and \n\nFelt disrespected but \nPretended to \u2018let\u2019 her have some time shopping with them while\nCalling her 37 times from the parking lot \n\nAnd then screamed at her, flipped off her friends who had nothing to do with her choices or yours and sped off.\n\nThen kept texting.\n\nThen reported that all here and only \u2018feel bad\u2019 about your reaction without realizing how out of control it was.\n\nThis is not a healthy relationship.  In a healthy relationship she would have said oh hey, my friends are gonna be there too the day before.    But - she was probably just delaying you screaming. And calling 37 times about it.", "What the hell, you sound like a walking red flag.\n\nFirst you say sure take as long as you want, I'll pick you up when you are done, then you turn around in one breath and tell her to be back in a ridiculous little time.\n\nYou could have gone to a caf\u00e9 and eat/drink something or spend the time wherever but you decided to wait outside, then call her an alarming amount of times.\n\nYou sound controlling as fuck and I seriously hope she wakes up and dumps your ass.\n\nEdit: yta of course.", "You need to consider the path you\u2019re currently on. You are showing abusive and controlling tendencies and exhibited abusive and controlling behaviour. Every single person in this young lady\u2019s life is begging her to stay the hell away from you as you did this in public in front of her people. To clarify, she is being advised by her loved ones to hide away from you because you behaved in a predatory fashion towards her. Whomever in your life makes you feel that you can treat them the way you treated her, spare them the trauma and leave them alone. YTA and I hope you get some real help. Poor girl!", "YTA that's not your gf anymore. \n\nYou manipulated,  tried to control, and finally embarrassed her. Buddy of you didn't want to ruin her day there were so many other options than the one you chose. You started off well by doing your boundaries and leaving and then immediately dive bombed. You got to get control of yourself.  Better luck next time.", "YTA\n\nI would be annoyed if what I thought was a one on one hang out turned into a hang out with a bunch of people I wasn't prepared to see. She should've communicated better.\n\nBut every. Single. Part. Of how you handled this was pathetic and shitty.\n\nYou didn't want to shop? Cool. Drive home and pick her up later. Or find something interesting to investigate and keep yourself entertained. Your gf didn't make you stew in a hot parking lot, YOU made that choice.\n\nAlso, it's not on you to tell her how much time she can spend shopping. 30 minutes is hardly enough time to get into a shop, find something, and try it on. You could've said \"be back here in exactly 7 minutes\" and it would've been exactly as reasonable of a request- meaning it isn't at all.\n\nFinally, you called her THIRTY SEVEN TIMES???? Dude that's unhinged behavior all by itself. It's completely unacceptable to constantly spam her like that. I would've dumped you for that alone. But top it off with you SCREAMING and cursing at her and her friends??? Absolutely shameful and mortifying. I'd never be seen with you again.\n\nScreaming at your partner is ABUSIVE behavior. It is NEVER acceptable. You have some big fucking issues you need to sort out, because you are clearly too immature to handle your big feelings. I know toddlers who have a better grasp on their emotions than you do.\n\nEnjoy being single.", "YTA.  You need an anger management class.", "Yta for every single aspect of this situation. She invited to to come to the mall, You didn't want to hang out with her friends and opted to sit in the car and demand she only take 30 minutes. Then called her 37 times, screamed at her and fluoped off her friends as you sped away. You're abusive and a terrible boyfriend. Get some help for your major issues. Also prepare to be single.", "YTA.\n\nYou called 37 times while she was shopping. Ridiculous.\n\nYou sat in the parking lot in 103 degree heat rather than go into the mall. Ridiculous.\n\nYou screamed and swore at her when your misery was caused by your own choice not to go into the mall. Ridiculous.", "YTA. You chose not to hangout with your girlfriend. You chose to sit in the car on a hot day. You decided to flip out when she spent more than 30 minutes in the mall. You decided to angrily call her 37 times. You cussed her out in front of her friends and then made rude gestures at them. You are an unhinged toxic boyfriend. You are dating a teenager and have allowed yourself to get wildly angry because she was doing harmless teenage things. Stop the abusive behavior. Do everyone a favor and break-up with her, if she hasn't already broken up with you.", "YTA 100% OP. There are so many red flags on your end here. It would be understandable if you had calmly asked her to tell you up front about her friends being at the mall, but beyond that this is a simple miscommunication on her part. \n\nOn your end you made your own decision to sit in the car, to call her 37 times over something petty like this situation. You act like it\u2019s 100% her fault YOU chose to sit in the car in 103 degree weather. Who does that? Go inside the mall and look around\n\nYou should never order your girlfriend to \u201cgtf in the car\u201d and flip off her friends, now they will always call you that crazy guy who called their friend 37 times at the mall and flipped them off for trying to spend time with her. \n\nI hope she dumps you and moves on asap, you need help", "\"I feel bad about how I reacted but at the time I was truly angry about the situation.\"\n\n\"But I was really really mad\" is not a good enough reason for your behavior towards your (probably ex) girlfriend here, OP. Especially since you're the one who made the bizarre decision to sit outside in your car in 103 heat!! She didn't \"have you\" waiting outside the mall, you CHOSE to wait outside the mall. You could have gone inside to hang out with her or get a soda or even just sit on a bench in the air conditioning. It sounds like you were mad it wasn't just the two of you at the mall and you went out of your own way to make yourself miserable so you could start a fight. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nAnd she's your EX girlfriend now, boo.", "YTA\n\nHope this is fake, but if it's not ... You sound like an awful person and for her sake I hope she dumps you. Should she have told you about her friends joining, yeah, sure, however everything after that is your own fault or an overreaction. \n\n* You chose not to go with them\n* You chose to wait in the parking lot (instead of leave)\n* You chose to stay in the car (instead of just waiting inside)\n* You expect her to be back in 30 minutes... seriously?\n* You call her 37 (!!) times\n* You scream at her \n* You flip off her friends (what exactly did they do to you?)\n\nLearn how to communicate your frustration properly.", "YTA.\n\nAnd I am so proud of her for going home and refusing to be your verbal and emotional punching bag!\n\nYou're an adult... I understand you still have a few years until the decision-making part of your brain is fully formed, but honey... who chooses to sit in the car in 103\u00b0 weather?", "I would never be alone with you again with that behavior. That\u2019s scary dude- screaming, speeding, flipping off the friends? That\u2019s literally terrifying red flags. And her friends no doubt hate you know, which is a relationship killer. She definitely is going to leave you if she hasn\u2019t already blocked you in everything. YTA.", "YTA My dude, I am going to give you some genuine advice for handling this situation. I am going to explain some things you missed and yes, I\u2019m going to drag you over the coals a little bit, but then I am going to tell you what to do now. \n\nI understand being confused and a little disappointed when you discovered this was going to be a group activity instead of just you and your gf. But feeling disrespected? If your gf wants to hang out with you AND her friends, that means she likes you enough to integrate you into her social circle; have her friends become your friends; maybe even show you off to them a bit! Like. A girl wanting you to join a girls shopping trip is usually a sign that something is going right in the relationship! \n\nBut instead you felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d. And then proceeded to do literally everything wrong. You could have hung out with your gf, gotten to know her friends. You could have found one of those little areas in the mall with the couches for bored husbands and boyfriends to sleep on while their girl shops. There\u2019s air conditioning in the mall.  \n\nYou say you didn\u2019t want to ruin her day, yet you asked her to keep a mall trip under 30 minutes. You don\u2019t say how she replied to that; my guess is she probably said \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d with laughter bc that\u2019s no time at all. You didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m going to be waiting in the abysmal heat so please don\u2019t take long.\u201d If you had I imagine she would have told you they would probably be a while and you should wait in the mall or something. \n\nYou chose to sit in the hot car. And look, it isn\u2019t clear what period of time passed where you were calling her 37 times, but if someone called me 37 times over the course of 24 hours I would be expecting to hear that someone had died. If someone called me 37 times in what, 30 minutes? And given the age you purport to be (which tbh I\u2019m not totally sure I believe that you are only 21. Given that you CALLED 37 times) I doubt you JUST called. How many angry text messages were there? Or what did you say in one text or one voicemail that told her you weren\u2019t calling because of some emergency and she felt justified in ignoring your growing number of calls and seeing them for the red flag they are.\n\nIn all honesty, in a true attempt to help you: please, please seek therapy for your anger management, control issues, and communication issues. None of the behavior you described is remotely healthy. It\u2019s not just your screaming that is the problem. It\u2019s all the behavior and thought patterns that led you to end up alone in the car in 103 degree heat and directing all your anger at your girlfriend even though it was your own choices, not her, that got you into this situation. You don\u2019t see how any of it is your own fault. Her not mentioning her friends did not mean you had to stay in the car. Her taking longer than 30 minutes did not mean you had to stay in the car with no ac. It also did not mean you needed to call her a disturbing number of times. Your anger at her is misplaced. If you don\u2019t want to become the kind of guy who girls tell horror stories to their friends about, then you need to work on yourself. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to think you are the asshole, which tells me you probably don\u2019t WANT to be an asshole. So be proactive about dealing with your AH tendencies while you still can.\n\nAs for your girlfriend, buddy there is no coming back from this one. Sorry, but you said the quiet part loud in front of all her friends. And really, even if she does somehow consider forgiving you, the best thing you can do is focus on improving yourself instead of dating. \n\nIf she hasn\u2019t blocked your number, send her 1 (one), ONE single message that says something like this: \u201cI am beginning to understand that my behavior today was unacceptable, and if you no longer want to speak to me, I completely understand and respect your decision.  I am going to seek help for my anger management and controlling behavior, because I do not want to be the kind of guy I was today. I am truly sorry for everything that I did, and I realize that I need to do some serious work on myself before I get back into a relationship. Maybe one day when I have grown as a person and no longer have these issues, we could try again. But given what I did I do understand if I have blown my chance with you. I wish you the best.\u201d \n\nAnd then actually follow through. Get help, focus on improving yourself. Regardless of if she receives or responds to your message. You were absolutely TA today. But you don\u2019t have to be in the future.", "YTA\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a bit annoying that she didn\u2019t properly communicate to you that she was also going to be with her friends, but that in no way excuses all of your ridiculous behaviour\n\n\u201cI asked her not to take longer than 30 min\u201d\n\nUnreasonable to ask, that\u2019s barely enough time to do anything\n\n\u201cI called my gf 37 times\u201d\n\nYou called her 37 times???! What??? That\u2019s so excessive. Didn\u2019t you get the hint after the first 30 calls that she wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk to you??\n\n\u201cScreamed at her to get the F in the car and flipped off her friends as I sped off\u201d\n\n\u2026That my friend, puts you into what I call the \u201csuper\u201d AH catagory. That was so rude and disrespectful\n\n\u201cTrying not to ruin her day, I told her to hang out with them\u201d\n\n\u2026 I\u2019m lost for words bro", "YTA\nLike the 37 times you called her while she was at the mall! She will not answer any others from you", "WTF kind of plan was that? You were going to wait in a hot parking lot while they went to the mall? A trip to the mall takes like 2 hours if you've got a squad of people who all want to look at things and browse and confer. You tell her to be done in 30 minutes, and you magically think that's going to work??   \n\n\nIf you didn't want to follow the crowd of girls around, you should have found something else you wanted to do. You are 100% responsible for your own misery, and you took it out on a bunch of other people *who in no way owed you any kind of adherence to your time limit demands.*  \n\n\nYTA. You were trying to control something you have no power or right to any control over. You found yourself in a bummer situation and you made it 1000x worse with your own choices.  \n\n\nNext time, find a better way to roll with the punches. Don't set yourself up to be an AH the way you did this time.", "YTA\n\n\nI hope you genuinely reflect on this and recognize that you need help. None of your actions were healthy or \"normal\".\n\n\n\nSeriously... You're a giant pile of red flags. \n\n\nShe should've been clearer in what the plans were and how they involved other people. But you escalated everything so far that honestly it's a good thing she didn't, she has now seen the sort of behavior you are capable of in public, and can imagine what you're capable of in private.", "You misspelled ex-gf.", "You are abusive. And TA but mostly abusive and controlling", "YTA Holy shit you did everything wrong. What a miserable prick. Also, I think you meant ex-gf.", "YTA - you chose to extracate yourself from the social group, put unrealistic demands on her time and then were extremely rude towards her friends, who were not to blame for this. For the simple reason that you thought you were going to have your GF to yourself and then realised she had an alternative plan, and that made you feel \"disrespected\". The only one as far as I can see acting disrespectfully is the person who started flipping off others because they were annoyed and angry\n\nAll you have managed to achieve is to throw up a hell of a lot of red flags. You could have very easily gone \"oh, OK, I have to share you with your friends for a while, well that sucks but it is what it is, I will play the dutiful BF\" trailed around with them for a while and then spent quality time with your GF after the group was done socialising, all the while earning yourself big brownie points.", "YTA for this extreme reaction.

Had I been her friend and vitnessed your behaviour I would be begging her to leave before you became violent", "A million different ways you could have handled this situation and you chose one of the worst ones.

And *you're* the older one?", "YTA and you are not ready to be in a relationship. Your behavior was controlling and out of control, you need therapy because your reaction is not appropriate at all.

You didn't realize you're unhinged at the time? You need help. Bad. You're a walking red flag. If you hadn't put your age here, I almost would've thought you were my ex. Spoiler warning: he got hella abusive in every single way and controlled every factor of my life until I escaped. Six years later, I'm still dealing with the ramifications. Disastrous, destructive, insecure little moles like you need to leave other people alone. First-hand experience says you kind of people don't change without some sort of therapy. Like, inpatient psychiatric care for a long-term period kind of help is what you need. I'm pretty sure she ghosted you because she doesn't feel safe about the idea of breaking it off with you in any way - over text or in person - and frankly, I don't blame her. You seem the type of freak who would snap and physically hurt her in some way if she did, that you'd end up on the news and her obituary on the paper. So, for her sake and safety, I hope she never sees you again. Do her and yourself a favor: Leave her be. Delete her number. Delete every memory you have of her.

Text her what you are going to do and leave it at that, if she wants to leave earlier than an hour and a half movie I'm sure one of her friends could oblige otherwise stop being a nut and deal with it.

Please take some time to deal with that professionally. \n\nFIRST - You got upset because you GF didn't tell you about her plans to just hang out with her friends and using you as a ride to the mall. That is okay. You can be a bit hurt by that. If that was the case, you needed to wait and tell her how you felt privately. \n\nSECOND - You got more upset when your needs of attention weren't met (by feeling like a 3rd wheel) and left. In that instance, you should have tried to instead bond with her friends and with her.\n\nTHIRD - When you left them, you decided to sulk instead of shopping, eating/drinking, or just browsing around the mall. You wanted to sulk and get more upset because you decided to stay in the car. That gave you a new excuse to be more upset as the weather was hot, and now you felt she disregarded you even more.\n\nFOURTH - You called many times, and now you are into the boiling point. If she didn't respond, you could have easily sent a text and told her you were going somewhere or home as an hour had passed and she wasn't replying. \n\nFIFTH - You lost your F mind and now your GF for being big A. You could have easily avoided all of this and just talked to her later privately about how it made you feel.\n\nKnow the following, too:\n1. No one goes shopping for just 30 mins, especially a girl in an outing with her friends. You were doomed from the start.\n2. No one deserves to be treated like your GF was treated when you picked her up. That is outright disrespectful and shows a lack of caring for her as a human being.\n3. You were right to be upset but not to explode the way you did. If your feelings get hurt, you have the right to say something. However, you undoubtedly acted like a fool. \n\nI hope you learn from this and get help. It isn't normal to act that way, and if you don't deal with it, sooner or later, you'll regret it.", "I hope this girl run for her life.\n\nThis is wife beater behaviour", "YTA. Her friends should of stopped her from getting in the car with you.", "If you have to ask if you're the asshole, then you're the asshole snowflake", "Better find a lawyer because I think you'll need one sooner rather than later.", "YTA- why did you flip off the friends? I don\u2019t think you were wrong to be upset that she said she wanted to see you, and then wanted to shop with her friends- that\u2019s a little strange. Every thing else you did was immature.", "YTA. I hope she doesn\u2019t dump you. I hope she cheats on you and you walk in on another dude dicking her down.

Whenever we see each other we cuddle and give long hugs because since I am working, when I come to her house I will have her come to the parking lot, talk and then hug her hard before I go. \n\nFor reference, she\u2019s 19 and I\u2019m 21. She will be 20 at the end of the year. Yesterday my gf asked if we could hang out, she said she wanted to go to the Mall and wanted me there, however she never mentioned any friends coming along. I get to her house, she gets in and we pull up to the mall and I see a bunch of her friends waiting on her. She explains that we\u2019re all going shopping and I felt like I was third wheeling. I felt really disrespected. \n\nTrying not to ruin her day, I told her to hang out with them and I\u2019d come back when she was ready. I then decided to wait in the parking lot since I had nowhere to go in the area. I asked her not to take longer than 30 mins. 45 mins passes, and hour passes, I called my gf 37 times. No answer so now I\u2019m infuriated. She comes out of the mall, I\u2019m sweating bc it\u2019s 103 degrees and I pulled to the front of the mall, screamed for her to get the f in the car and I flipped off her friends as I sped off. \n\nMy gf won\u2019t respond to any of my texts after I dropped her off at the house, and I feel bad about how I reacted but at the time I was truly angry about the situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your girlfriend isn\u2019t obligated to tell you that it\u2019s not a couples trip to the mall AND spending time with her and her friends is going to make a huge difference between the success or failure of your relationship. You\u2019re not a 3rd wheel, you\u2019re being a participant in her life. What you did instead was make a decision, YOU decided to sit in the parking lot in 103 degree weather and YOU put a time limit on another person, she did not agree, she was put in a bad position. Then you had the nerve to call her 37 times!? That\u2019s disrespectful. She had no obligation to follow the rules you placed on her and sitting in a hot car was YOUR CHOICE. Then you screamed at her in front of her friends. You\u2019re going to need to learn to control your anger, screaming at someone, especially in a public place for doing nothing wrong is inexcusable. If it were me, I\u2019d never have gotten into the car with you at all and I\u2019d have called someone else to pick me up from the mall.

They will stage interventions to keep her away from you. \n\nThe reason they will do this is because you are an abusive jerk, and they care about her. You don't deserve her.

Or you could have just made the most of a chance to get to know her friends and hung out with them anyway, because it's good to be on good terms with your partner's friends\n Instead you yelled at her publicly, swearing, and her friends are now probably advising her to keep the hell away from you!", "YTA ever thought that she wanted you to meet her friends?

Let\u2019s break down what really happened.\n\nYou felt disrespected so instead of making the most of the situation or explaining to your girlfriend that you were expecting to hang out solo, you decided to turn yourself into a victim so you\u2019d have an excuse to \u201cjustifiably\u201d (in your mind) blow up on her. No one told you to leave. No one told you to wait in your car without the A/C on for an hour in 103 degree weather. You say that you didn\u2019t want to ruin her day but you know damn well that no one goes to the mall for 30 minutes when they\u2019re hanging out with friends and your demand that she finish within half an hour was absurd.
