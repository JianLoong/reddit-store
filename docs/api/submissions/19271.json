My dog is fine, barks a little when he first sees them (I keep him in a sit when guests arrive, so he does bark a little but it's from the opposite side of the room) but he goes quiet soon enough and I tell my relatives that I'm going to let him come up to them to sniff them.

And I had no intention of closing him outside on the balcony, because it's too hot again it's not fair. \n\nThey got very angry then, called me an asshole and told me I was prioritizing a dog over my own family and that they would speak to my parents.

It is unfair to let someone into the home and expect the dog to be kept on leash and muzzled at all times. Home is where your pets are meant to feel safe and secure. I find it incredibly rude that they said they were okay with the dog when you mentioned it but then just expected them to be kept like this at your home.\n\nThis is not a normal request for staying over somewhere and it should have been communicated. I hope your parents agree with you. \n\nIf someone comes over for a day or a couple of hours this would probably be fine for most. But an entire week is too much for the dog.

I could see a day, or a weekend, but a week of disrupting your dog\u2019s life is a lot based on the sounds of it.  I\u2019m not even a dog fan and I think it\u2019s too much.", "NTA.

You told them politely what they already should have known. They can choose another place to stay.\n\nCompletely unfair to you and the dog to expect the dog to be restrained for a WEEK day in and day out. \n\nIn addition to it being unpleasant for the dog, when do you get to go to the toilet or take a shower? Do you have to shut the dog in the bathroom with you? For a WEEK?", "NTA. \n\nThey have put conditions on their stay that you aren't able to accommodate. It really is that simple.

They were stressed visiting and this made him even more stressed and reactive.  But you are a bit of an A-H for the delusion you wrap yourself in.\n\n>*I(25F)'ve got a dog who's very reactive and fear-aggressive.  He's three now, and he's very, very well trained because obedience is the only way to manage his reactivity. He's never off-leash in public, and I always keep his muzzle with me. This is to say that I take every precaution to avoid accidents.*\n\nI have loved and cared for 7 dogs over my lifetime; most were well trained but one only mastered basic training.  OP, you need to realize your dog is anything but well trained based on your description.  He may have basic training and know the commands (sit, stay, come, etc) but well trained includes community safe behaviour and not reacting unless you give the command to react.  If you need to take precautions to protect the public from your dog every time you take him outside, such as needing to have a muzzle due to aggressive fear reactions in social situation that is the opposite of well trained.\n\nLook, he is 3 yrs old which makes him a pandemic puppy and they tend to be more fear aggressive and unpredictable due to limited socialization during lockdowns.  He is still worthy of your love and affection and absolutely still a \u2018*good boy*\u2019 but you need to fully understand that you should not be telling people he is well trained as in a lawsuit that will be used against you.  When you say well trained you are essentially 100% assuring safety and that fraudulent statement increases your liability if he bites.  I recommend telling people he has mastered basic command training but like most pandemic puppies he is not well socialized.\n\nBTW, my one dog I mentioned earlier?  He\u2019s 3 yrs old and a pandemic puppy too.  Despite my lifelong experience with dogs, the lack of socialization during the pandemic has irreversibly shaped his personality.  So it\u2019s not you, it not him, it\u2019s the lack of socialization for most of his life.", "NTA.  The dog is family too. And it\u2019s his house.", "NTA. You are 100% correct. That is your dog's home and he has a right to be comfortable in his home. It would be easier and cheaper for them to find a hotel than it would for you to board your dog safely and comfortably in order to allow them to visit comfortably. If they can't cope with how your dog is they don't need to be around your dog. It's unreasonable for them to have those expectations.", "Lol, why not? It's not like the situation can get any worse. What I did is already the direst of crimes in our culture.", "In my culture, it\u2019s the dirtiest of crimes to muzzle and leash a dog in their apartment because a guest insisted on it."]}
