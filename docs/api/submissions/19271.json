He's three now, and he's very, very well trained because obedience is the only way to manage his reactivity. He's never off-leash in public, and I always keep his muzzle with me. This is to say that I take every precaution to avoid accidents.*\n\nI have loved and cared for 7 dogs over my lifetime; most were well trained but one only mastered basic training.  OP, you need to realize your dog is anything but well trained based on your description.  He may have basic training and know the commands (sit, stay, come, etc) but well trained includes community safe behaviour and not reacting unless you give the command to react.  If you need to take precautions to protect the public from your dog every time you take him outside, such as needing to have a muzzle due to aggressive fear reactions in social situation that is the opposite of well trained.\n\nLook, he is 3 yrs old which makes him a pandemic puppy and they tend to be more fear aggressive and unpredictable due to limited socialization during lockdowns.  He is still worthy of your love and affection and absolutely still a \u2018*good boy*\u2019 but you need to fully understand that you should not be telling people he is well trained as in a lawsuit that will be used against you.  When you say well trained you are essentially 100% assuring safety and that fraudulent statement increases your liability if he bites.  I recommend telling people he has mastered basic command training but like most pandemic puppies he is not well socialized.\n\nBTW, my one dog I mentioned earlier?  He\u2019s 3 yrs old and a pandemic puppy too.  Despite my lifelong experience with dogs, the lack of socialization during the pandemic has irreversibly shaped his personality.  So it\u2019s not you, it not him, it\u2019s the lack of socialization for most of his life.", "NTA.  The dog is family too. And it\u2019s his house.", "NTA. You are 100% correct. That is your dog's home and he has a right to be comfortable in his home. It would be easier and cheaper for them to find a hotel than it would for you to board your dog safely and comfortably in order to allow them to visit comfortably. If they can't cope with how your dog is they don't need to be around your dog. It's unreasonable for them to have those expectations.", "Lol, why not? It's not like the situation can get any worse.

I worked in animal rescue and love OP for what she's doing for her dog. I also love what you said about being very well trained.

Almost everyone expects a well trained dog not to need a muzzle at any time. But, OP loves this dog and, as time goes on and he has more time to learn he isn't going to be hurt or have to fight, he could eventually become a dream animal.

I can rely on him to follow my commands, but I can't quite trust his independent thinking.  I'm not sure I'm making sense, I hope I am.\n\nI prefer being overcautious instead of regretful.\n\nAnd the muzzle is required by law to be on my person at all times when walking my dog... most people ignore said law, tbf, but my dog is not little by any means, so I'd rather avoid a fine if I can... plus, as I said, I don't quite trust him completely, and if one day I were to need it, I'd rather have it in my possession.", "I totally see your point", "NTA I'm a mailman who has been bitten on the butt by a dog so I think I know how terrifying it can be to be attacked, I have dogs on my route whom are barkers and will attack and I have dogs who are the sweetest dogs you will ever meet and want nothing more than pets and possibly a treat but every dog is different. If your dog was aggressive and barking and would bite everyone but you I would say keep them locked up in a different room but you have trained and taught them to be better at social interactions and are doing everything right.

He was home before I got him, where his first experience of home life was to be beaten and abused. He, unsurprisingly had very bad fear aggression, was totally shut down. We have also done a LOT of training with him to get him to where he is. Like yours, he is never off lead, I carry a muzzle, and even though he is very well behaved now, I will always have to be mindful of his past. A dog with a traumatic/aggressive past, much like a human, will always be susceptible to relapse, we can only try and manage them, give them a safe and loving environment. His home is his safe space, again much like a human. \n\nYou told them the situation, they agreed, and then you changed the arrangement last minute to accommodate them (understandably given the trauma) however, that was only because of the situation in front of you, and not something you would have agreed with otherwise. Which is probably the exact same thing I would do. However it was traumatic for you and your dog, and that could result in a dangerous situation if that causes a relapse in behavior, something which probably won't be evident until after the event. If you aren't aware of it, look up trigger stacking, understanding this helped us so much with our idiot. \n\nIf they want to return, it has to be on your terms, because you don't want to undo the amazing work you've already done, if they can't accept that, they need to stay somewhere else, and make clear this was a one off, if they think they can turn up and change your mind, they will find themselves without accommodation. This is not you putting an animal above a human, it's you making sure your dog is safe happy and well adjusted in order that he can have a fulfilling life, and not become a 'dangerous dog' thus becomes a danger to humans.", "NTA - They don\u2019t get to dictate anything in your home.

Sorry he had witnessed some dog attack but thats not on you, thats on him.  From your post it looks like you were being used for convenience, with your apartments location in relation to the city.  So you were saving him cash on this trip when he dumped this unexpected restriction on you.

A fear aggressive dog will react with aggression first. \n\nA fear reactive dog in the wrong hands can easily become fear aggressive because it learns that it's fear signs will just be ignored. Fear aggression is much harder to train out than fear reactivity, because with reactivity, if you can learn the signs, you can intervene, and also do some desensitisation work.
