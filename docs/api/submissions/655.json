For me personally, just the mere sight of an animal I start screaming as if I\u2019m being murdered to a point where it is embarrassing and I start sprinting for dear life. Do NOT even go down that road. By saying that she should get therapy, you are basically saying that what he did is alright but what he did was the equivalent to a guy pranking his wife with horrible pranks everyday and calling it fine even when she starts getting startled or afraid because she thinks out of no where he is going to do something. Communication is needed. She already addressed her fear and if it\u2019s a fear of dogs, I DOUBT she would be able to make it something that\u2019s impossible to see.

He gets to look like the hero to your son at your expense. You guys could have worked something out if there was a discussion beforehand. But once your husband brought the dog home, it was too late to save the situation. Your son was already going to have his heart broken and blame you for it if you sent it away. That being said, getting therapy for your phobia would be a good idea. Not just because of this specific circumstance, but because you are not likely to be able to avoid dogs for the rest of your life.

Has your husband never walked into a pet store and taken a look at the labels on the aisles?  There are a TON of pets that are not dogs.  Yet he still went ahead and bought one behind your back.  That's cruel to both you and your son (edit: and the dog, as /u/squirrel_acorn pointed out and I should have thought to mention originally!).  And you \\*did\\* try to work around it by setting a boundary.  A boundary that could have been easily respected because \\*you can train dogs\\*.\n\nNow, having said that, your son \\*is\\* attached.  Your husband has put you in a really shit position here, because even if he gets rid of the dog and takes full blame for it (which he should), by the wording of your post your son is still relatively young, and if he connects that you got afraid of the dog and now the dog is gone, there's a real risk he's going to latch onto that as the reason and blame you regardless.  So... well, again, your husband has made a real fucking mess out of his family because of his selfishness.  Currently you're miserable and your son is happy.  Lose the dog and your son is miserable and you aren't happy about him being miserable but feel safe again, but his relationship with at least one of you will likely suffer a blow.  Do you know anybody who would be willing to take the dog that your son could visit regularly so he could still at least be in the dog's life?  Someone who would either respect you enough to keep the dog away from you when you're included in the visit, or that your son visits but you don't?\n\nWhatever happens next here, I think you're going to need to start family therapy.  That he pays for, because this is his mess to clean up.  You \\*could\\* look into therapy on how to get past your fear of dogs, that's up to you if you want to take that route or not (also should be solely his financial responsibility).  But whether you do or don't, you also need to talk to a therapist about how to best deal with your son's feelings and reactions if you do need to remove the dog from the family.  That's vital.  And you should also be digging into why your husband made a decision that impacted you so severely, knowing how you felt, and why he was willing to use his own child as an emotional manipulation tactic to make you keep the dog in order to avoid hurting your son - again, a hurt that would be caused by \\*him\\* but that would \\*feel\\* like it was caused by you.

Your husband obviously has no regard for your feelings and little regard for the health of your unborn child as well. And as for the son being attached to the dog? That is 100% on the dad.

I'm sure he is confused and saddened by the fact that one of the heads of household is genuinely afraid of him and loathes his presence- that can't be good for his mental health.

As a small child who walked to and from school every day, this was really scary and I'd memorised where all the dogs lived so I could zig zag across the street to avoid them, and the evasion behaviour just sort of stuck.\n\nI started getting over my fear when I was in my mid-teens - being larger than most dogs helped a lot.

However therapy is not a magic bullet where you just go for a couple of sessions and boom, you're cured. I'm honestly kind of baffled by the responses that seem to think this. With dog phobias in particular it usually doesn't just take months, it tends to take *years*. And even then that doesn't mean you're necessarily comfortable with having a dog living in your home or being alone with said dog.\n\n\nI used to have a pretty severe phobia of dogs myself and it took me over a decade to get to a point where I was mostly fine with dogs *outside* my home. I'm still weary around off leash dogs I don't know, though imo that part isn't entirely unreasonable. But any time another off leash dog comes running up to me aggressively, it's a major setback that I have to work through again.\n\n\nI'm now only very very recently at a point where I could consider getting a pet dog. I'm not afraid of the vast majority of dogs now and will happily pet them outside if their owners say they're friendly.

You are right about that.", "That his reaction to that was to suggest to expose her more to the dog makes it seem like it was not an acciedent.", "Doh, bad reading comprehension on my part.  I had read it as him deciding to bring the dog inside anyway, despite promising it'd never happen.  I agree that a single strike shouldn't be enough to get the dog rehomed, although maybe she's \\*really\\* freaked about dogs.", "Her husband being shitty to begin with doesn't negate the fact that OP didn't put her foot down in the first place. ESH.", "Your exaggerating. He literally did not manipulate and coerce her. She gave in really quickly. He said he'd be keep it away, he didnt manipulate her, and he somehow managed to for 2 MONTHS. Also don't play stupid. You specifically were like why are u calling her TA? He was just as bad if not worse. \n\nThat is a useless thing to say if u already knew it was ESH. Clearly you thought i said YTA or it would make no sense to say That.", "I agree with you, but since I am a very literal person, I will point out that the husband promised that the dog wouldn't come near her. She doesn't say that it did. She only says that the dog came into the house and it freaked her out. There's no mention of a promise that the dog will never enter the house.", "She sucks for thinking this is even a possibility... The dog lives at the same house.", "I'm a psychology grad student so I'm biased and my brain went toward \"oh he's trying to desensitize her phobia\" which, taken with a lethal dose of salt, is good intentions with shit execution. She'd obviously need to be on board for that.   \n\n\nThat being said, it's still way too vague to really read into further. It pretty much just says \"DOG GOT IN, BIG MAD\". Dogs will go wherever they can go, especially if there are humans to be found. Especially if those humans start squealing and making fun noises and running when they find them.", "Lol the first place was WHEN SHE TOLD HIM SHE IS TERRIFIED OF DOGS", ">She gave in really quickly.\n\nCitation needed?\n\n>He said he'd be keep it away, he didnt manipulate her, and he somehow managed to for 2 MONTHS.\n\nYou're undermining your own argument here, I think. If you honestly believe that OP should have known better (which is fair), then at the very least, you have to acknowledge that OP's husband *also* should have known better. He was either knowingly making a promise he couldn't keep (which is manipulative), or making a promise he thought he could keep (which is naive). Either way, he was well aware of what would happen if he couldn't keep this promise, so that's still on him.\n\n>Also don't play stupid. You specifically were like why are u calling her TA?\n\nNot sure what you mean? It's a subreddit where we decide if we think the OP is an asshole or not - an E S H judgment is saying that all parties involved are assholes, though not necessarily in equal measure. \n\nI think we actually do agree that the husband is the worse party here. No intention to offend, just giving my opinion in a subreddit where we're meant to do that lol.", "Exactly! She doesn\u2019t even say the dog came near her, just that it *came in the house*! Does OP have a very specific measurement that counts as \u201cnear\u201d her? Does she carry a ruler with her to keep track? \n\nESH", "In my mind they live in mansion and the dog was seen to have entered the east wing", "OP seriously needs some therapy for the dog phobia if she can't even exist in the same building as a dog. Plus the way the post is written makes it sound like the dog is supposed to be outside 100% of the time to me, which is awful!"]}
