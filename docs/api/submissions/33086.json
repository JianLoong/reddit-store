My daughter (I'll call her Amber 28F) and her wife (Chloe 32F) decided to have a baby. \n\nAmber was due next week and asked me to come and stay with her a few days ago until her giving birth. I gladly did. All this time, Chloe (who is a doctor) worked crazy hours and barely paid Amber any attention. I kept it to myself and thought it would be best if I didn't say anything about it.\n\nTwo days ago Amber's water broke and I rushed her to the hospital. She gave birth a week earlier than expected and she needed to have an emergency c-section. All this time I was trying to reach Chloe and she was not available. \n\nShe showed up a few hours after the birth and said she was sorry she was in the OR and didn't have her phone with her at the time. I got really mad and called her irresponsible, said it was crazy that she misses her own son's birth and asked her to explain what would have happened if Amber had some kind of a complication during the c-section.\n\nChloe said she couldn't let someone die under her supervision because of this and made it as soon as she could. I still can't believe she obviously doesn't prioritize Amber or her son but my poor daughter thinks otherwise. She has rose coloured glasses on whenever chloe is around. \n\nAnyway, ever since Amber told me I was out of line and needed to apologise to her wife. She said Chloe already felt horrible and it was not her fault. Chloe hasn't said a word to me and by the way she still goes to the hospital and doesn't seem to care that her son is here.

Think about it like this, if the Doctor that performed the c-section had been in Chloe\u2019s shoes and got a page that their wife was in labour would it be okay for that doctor to just leave your daughter on the OR table and go?\n\nSounds like your daughter understands that her Wife is a doctor and that means sometimes they have to miss life events. It isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s part of the job. You calling her out on it makes you an asshole. You should apologize to avoid this becoming a bigger problem than it currently and avoid potentially creating a rift between you and your daughter.", "YTA. How would you have felt if the surgeon who was doing your daughters C-section stopped what they were doing to take a call and then just left? The nature of the job she does means that this is just a part of their life and it sounds like your daughter accepts that. \nYes, it is a shame that the US (I assume you are in the US) doesn't have decent parental leave and that people can't afford to do things like take weeks of leave in case the baby is born early or to stay and support once the baby is born but that is a US societal issue, not a behaviour issue on the people affected.", "YTA- your daughter asked you to stay with her, probably knowing her wife was not able to stop taking call because of her work.  Surgeons work brutal hours.  Is Chloe still in residency?  At 32 it seems likely that she\u2019s either in residency or a very junior position, and probably on call all the time.  If Amber is feeling like her emotional needs are met, don\u2019t create problems where they don\u2019t exist.", ">she couldn't let someone die under her supervision because of this\n\nand you want me to believe that she *should have* let someone die?", "YTA.\n\nShe\u2019s a physician.\n\nWe miss events sometimes. Big ones. It sucks. Hopefully, our families understand.\n\nWhen we miss something, it\u2019s because someone else\u2019s family takes priority.\n\nWould you have understood if the doctor performing the emergency C-section just ducked out in the middle of it?

It\u2019s hard enough as it is.\n\n\u2014 another physician", "YTA and shockingly ignorant. A surgeon cannot have their phone on them. And a surgeon has a person's life in their hands.

Don't know about you but I'm rather glad phones aren't allowed and the OR team focus. Each person in the room has a focused, concentrated, difficult role for many hours at a time and one twitch can mean life or death. Stop bring dramatic and appreciate this was unavoidable. Even outside the operating room not everyone has the luxury of a job, manager or employer that would let them go at a moments notice. Many employers don't allow mobile phones or personal calls at work, even in the situations you describe.

If Amber isnt worried about this then you need to give it a rest.", "YTA. Amber knew very well how things were when you date a surgeon : it's HER choice. You don't like it : it's not relevant.

You don't just stop in the middle of a surgery and say \"I'll finish later\"!", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t Grey\u2019s Anatomy where surgeons treat their family or where their phones are in the OR so a nurse can check it, tell the surgeon their baby is on the way, and the surgeon can dramatically storm out.", "YTA\n\n> She showed up a few hours after the birth and said she was sorry she was in the OR and didn't have her phone with her at the time.

People shouldn't actually literally die in order to make it though.", "YTA it\u2019s not your place to get in the middle of her relationship.\n\nI wonder if you would feel the same if your DIL was your SIL", "YTA. Your daughter in law was not off partying.  She was performing fucking surgery.  Of course she did not have her phone handy.  Keep your nose out of this.  This is what you sign up for when your spouse is a doctor.  Shit happens.", "YTA.  She was in surgery.  So she's the SURGEON doing the surgery?  What would you have had her do?  \"Oh, I'm sorry, gotta go...you can die on the table.\" ?", "YTA.\n\nShe didn't choose to miss it, especially since the timing wasn't expected.\n\nYour daughter, the one who gave birth, understands that doctors have to do their jobs. Why can't you?", "YTA. The OR is the OR! Stop trying to create drama in your daughter\u05f3s relationship", "YTA. Your DIL is a doctor. They can't just leave their job like someone who works 9 to 5.\n\nLet me ask you this. If she was a firefighter, would you be angry that she didn't let a building burn down to witness the birth?", "YTA. Writing this as a surgeon married to a surgeon. Sometimes when shit hits the fan, there is NO ONE ELSE who is able to do that operation. If the operation doesn\u2019t happen, the person dies. \n\nYour daughter was just operated on for an emergency situation, one in which if it didn\u2019t happen then and there, both your daughter and grandchild would have died. How would you feel if they had died because their surgeon had up and left for a family situation? \n\nYour DIL is looking after her wife by going to work and paying the bills, and by supporting her family the best she can. This is your daughter\u2019s family, not yours, and she seems pretty happy with the situation. \n\nYou need to seriously adjust your perspective unless you want to find yourself no longer invited to be part of their lives.", "One thing to take into account is the old adage, \"first children are always late.\" This is incorrect but causes many first-time parents to make plans assuming that their first children would not come early. \n\nI'm my parents' eldest. My dad was in England on a business trip when my mom went into labor in America, two weeks early. Everyone had told my parents that it would be okay for him to schedule his business trip that close to my due date because \"first children are always late,\" and so my parents mutually agreed on it. He was able to make it home before labor was finished because it was a different time back then and it was actually possible to get a trans-Atlantic flight at the drop of a hat, but my parents only ended up in that situation because of the advice of others around them. \n\nYou never mentioned whether Chloe working so close to Amber's due date was a mutual decision by the two of them or not. It could well have been-- Chloe is a *doctor* and there is currently a doctor shortage in the US because the residency system has not expanded to accommodate the increasing number of applicants and job openings. Some specialties are stretched extra thin right now because when starting med school, students were told \"by the time you graduate, this task will be fulfilled by robots (for some kinds of surgery) or AI (for things like radiology) so there won't be job openings for you; so choose a different specialty.\" \n\nOr, it may have been a chance to make more money before her child's birth so she could take more time off after the birth and be in a comfortable and safe financial position to provide for the child. \n\nOr it may have simply been a surgery that *only she* could perform well-- for some more complicated surgeries, there are very few surgeons who can perform them in a given area because surgeons at that high level tend to specialize. \n\nOr it may have been a gamble on the fact that most labors last *far* longer than a few hours, so she could do a shorter surgery without missing the whole process. Emergency C-sections are rare, and often happen only after labor has been attempted for some time. And maybe Amber was okay with that!\n\nSo, YTA for making judgments when there are plenty of reasons that Chloe could have absolutely needed to do that surgery, or thought that she had enough time. And you don't know whether Amber agreed or not; she may well have supported Chloe's decisions about work. You never even mentioned whether she does. Instead, you remove her agency by saying she has \"rose-colored glasses\" and distrusting your *adult* daughter's decision-making. She's a grown-up-- a mother now!-- and you can't just steamroll her own decisions and preferences.", "No no no no no. Your daughter married a doctor.
