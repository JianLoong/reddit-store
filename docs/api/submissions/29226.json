For about a year, we worked at similar jobs and made exactly the same amount every week. Then, I found an incredible job that made twice as much. Around that time, my partner was burnt out and we agreed that she should quit, take a month off, and then find a part time job. She agreed to take on a few more chores like laundry to help out at home more. This turned into six months of her jumping around jobs while I covered all our shared bills, and a few months out of that her car/phone bills as well...

Generally, if your salary goes up, the intense labor part of the job goes down.

However, since you have a housekeeper, he won\u00b4t really contribute to anything at home either. Maybe he can take over that job so that he is a stay-at-home-partner? Maybe he can do volunteering 5 days a week? Something at least so that he is contributing or doing something? Study and get a better degree?", "So as soon as you moved in together he\"lost\" his job huh?\n\nKeeping house is not nothing, but apparently you pay for a professional cleaner, so there can't be much to do.\n\nIs he making a decent job of cooking, laundry etc? \n\nYou didn't agree to support him in idleness, so he shouldn't assume that you will. \n\nIf he's unhappy with his earning potential, he could study for a different job.\n\nIMO, you're being taken for a ride.", "OP, it's all about what you think is fair. If my partner made 5% of what I made and didn't want to work (and we didn't have kids), I'd sit down with a list of things I needed from them, like:\n\n1. When I come home, I want the house to be cleaned. I will pick up after myself, but you'll be responsible for everything outside of that.\n2. I want the yards done (or managed, if someone does that).\n3. I want home cooked, nice meals, and home cooked, nice lunches for work.\n4. I want you to manage things. Do the grocery shopping, schedule appointments, schedule social events.\n5. Also, what money will your partner have access to? What are you comfortable with? Will you have a shared account you give him money for household expenses, and some fun money, and you keep the rest in your account?\n\nBasically, to me, if your partner is staying mostly busy and taking a HUGE load off of your shoulders, it'd be worth it to me for them to stay home. If they were just laying around all day, and I still had to take on the majority of the stress at home, I'd tell them to get a job.\n\nSo, it depends on the situation and what you need. If you don't care about him helping with household duties and just want him to contribute financially, tell him that. Give him a date by which he needs to have a job, or the relationship is over, and he's out of your home.\n\nAlso, all of this changes if you have kids.
