It worked out really well especially considering the rates that a live in housekeeper made in the HCL areas I was living in (We always looked up the paid rate of a live-in housekeeper/cook and factored that into how much rent was overall to make a judgment about whether or not the arrangement was fair and equitable.)\n\nTwo things however: \n1) I always had a rental agreement that explicitly spelled out this arrangement so that legally both of our butts were covered and it looked like I had been paying rent even if it had been in an exchange for future landlords /credit.\n2) It is a **lot** more work than your partner is thinking.
