We were not bitter at all and I still have a really good relationship with her. It was more that the love died out but we still respected each-other a lot.\n\nNow the divorce was a shock for the kids since they didn\u2019t see anything wrong, we rarely argued and just had good communication skills. It was an easy divorce. \n\nNow five years later I am remarried to the love of my life, all the kids were out of college and doing really well. The youngest just moved out and got a good job! The one problem is my daughter Sara has hated Cindy (new wife) the moment she met her. Cindy hasn\u2019t done anything to any of the kids, she is my age and pretty polite all in all. All the other kids like her. \n\nNow the problem, I have a family camp and invited all the kids to come up for a bonfire and food. Fun little get together, and everyone showed up. Sara made a face when she saw Cindy and asked what she is doing here. I told her for the bonfire since I am married to her. She called her a home wrecker and said I need to chose. I told her if she can\u2019t accept I am married than it is best if she stays out of my life.\n\nShe called me asshole and left. The kids think it was a bit harsh but I am unsure.\n\nAlso yes me and ex wife have a ad multiple conversation with her, it didn\u2019t work.", "created_utc": 1691067722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h3npm/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_if_she_cant_accept_i/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just need to check how close Cindy is to your daughter's age...", "ESH.\n\nNot for saying something, but for how far you took it.\n\nObviously, Sara is an AH for the way she's acting. Telling her to stay out of your life is a bit too far. Telling her something along the lines of this is more in line with how I would have responded as a father of two adult sons:\n\n*I get that there is some kind of issue between you and Cindy. She is my wife though, and she will continue to be a part of my life. She is not a homewrecker. She did not break up my marriage to your mom. If you don't want to stay this weekend because she's here, I'll accept that, but she's not leaving. I also think you and I need to have a conversation about this because I need to understand where all this hatred is coming from.*\n\nI added that last sentence because it really doesn't seem like you've tried to get to the root of the problem. You need to talk to Sara and you probably need to talk to your ex to see if she can get more information, especially since you say you have a \"really good relationship with her\".", "NTA\n\nShe issued an unreasonable ultimatum and lost.", "Nta.\n\nYour grown daughter is acting like a petulant child.", "ESH, your daughter isn't a teenager anymore so she needs to do the work of accepting this change BUT she'll always be your kid and I just think a parent telling a kid to stay out of their life for any other reason than the most extreme is wrong.", "NTA - your daughter has a lot of growing up to do.", "Yeah you should not tell your daughter that your new wife is more important than her.  \n\nBut clearly the 24 year old daughter needs to grow up.      The father should just reenforce her immature behavior?  \n\nObviously a father and daughter should have a relationship.    But what\u2019s the right answer here?", "NTA\n\nBut you really need to work on this! It\u2019s really concerning how much she hates your wife. It seems like she hasn\u2019t really processed the divorce. Maybe family counseling could be an option?", "Let her stew for a while. NTA. When she grows up she'll (hopefully) have a better understanding/perspective.", "Info: What steps have you taken to try to help Sarah get past her distress about your relationship and the divorce?", "NTA, but have you tried asking her to ignore Cindy instead of just cutting all contact? Though I think the root of the problem needs to be addressed for any sort of happy solution. If she won\u2019t listen to you when you\u2019ve explained the divorce, then maybe time for counseling.", "NTA.  Why did she get the idea  that your  new wife is  a home wrecker?  You need to dig a bit deeper on that.", "INFO - Were you having an affair with Cindy while married?", "Small YTA... \n\nKicking her out was 100% the right move. You also sound reasonable and are probably correct that your daughter is the problem. That said, she is your child. When you say \"stay out my life\" you are offering her a permanent only option for a situation that could potentially be resolved. A better statement may have been and you can stay away from us until you are ready to be civil and/or sit with us and have a real talk about your issues.", "NTA. Your daughter it\u2019s a grown up woman who needs to start acting like one. You did nothing wrong, she is the one who ask you to pick and you pick right. You already sacrificed a lot for them, and now it\u2019s your time to enjoy your life.", "Your daughter needs to grow up. NTA, and you should be applauded for standing up for your (non-homewrecker) wife.", "so she was surprised to see your wife at an event you and your wife were hosting, and then told you you needed to choose. choose what? be single forever or see her less? or remarry her mom (by force, i\u2019m assuming, since she was as much a part of the divorce as you. chain her up in the basement so sara can pretend her parents never got divorced???) or see her less? or never? she\u2019s not a kid. the divorce was five years ago. at this point no part of this is understandable and if she\u2019s got some shit going on it is hers to deal with. nta, please get an apology from her before you start inviting her to things again, i know she\u2019s old enough now that you shouldn\u2019t have to actively parent but holding a boundary is very much in her best interest at this point. just wow. truly amazing behaviour.", "NTA. I think it was a little harsh to tell her to stay out of your life if she can\u2019t get along with Cindy, but I also think the reaction of your daughter is very immature. \n\nIs it possible your ex-wife is telling her different things about the divorce? Did your ex-wife definitely want the divorce? It seems odd that an adult would behave this way if both parents are amicable about the situation. \n\nI do a firm stance is needed here. Cindy is not a home wrecker and it\u2019s been 5 years since you divorced. She\u2019s your wife now. Your kids don\u2019t have to like her, but they should treat her with respect", "NAH.\n\nMaybe therapy would help\u2026 but your daughter needs to come to an understanding that both you and her mom are allowed to move on and be happy: even if that\u2019s with someone new. Is that a conversation that\u2019s been had? Be gentle because while it is frustrating for you\u2026 she\u2019s clearly broken up about the divorce. Her parents will always be her parents even if they\u2019re not together anymore: maybe she\u2019s afraid you\u2019re starting a new family without her?\n\nNever try to push or force a relationship. Your kids will come to their own understanding about who their step parent is to them and how they want to relate (or not relate to them). Don\u2019t allow disrespect and always back up your new partner: but never force them to accept her either.\n\nGive it time and try to understand her view may change\u2026. Or it may never change. It\u2019s up to her- but she\u2019s definitely got some internal demons she\u2019s dealing with.", "ESH except your except for Cindy. \nClearly your daughter hasn\u2019t processed the divorce, and she\u2019s not a kid anymore, so maybe individual and family therapy can help with that. \nThat being said, you just told your daughter that your new wife is more important to you than she is. And that is not okay. \n\nI\u2019m curious, I understand that there was no cheating, but what was the timeline between you telling her about the divorce and when you started dating your wife?", "NAH or maybe ESH.\n\nYou have the right to choose your new family, i.e. your wife.\n\nYour daughter has the right to also choose who she tolerates as family at a \"family camp\".\n\nYou just both need to accept each other's choices, move on or attempt to find a new normal for the father/daughter if that's wanted.\n\nAre you okay with her staying out of your life forever? If not perhaps family therapy is a step. It can help both you and Sara verbalize your boundaries and emotions. Sara also probably needs separate therapy. If she's always been the outlier why didn't you guys try therapy with her sooner?\n\nReading it, Sara seemed caught off guard at Cindy and seems to think she needs a heads up when she will be around. Therapy could have helped her verbalize this instead of acting irrationally when confronted with.\n\nAlso you both sort of moved to extremes. \"Stay out of my life\" / \"You have to choose\". Sounds like things have been brewing for a while and therapy is needed for any sort of future. You two seem to not know how to communicate with one another (which isn't a fault to you).", "YTA - Sara is feeling threatened by Cindy and your solution is to confirm her fears by telling her that she\u2019s expendable? Really? The correct response to an unreasonable ultimatum is to refuse to choose. Leave it up to Sara whether she wants to attend events with your wife or not\u2026but then it would be on her. A good parent would never tell his child to get out of his life.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your ex have tried to get through to your daughter that Cindy wasn't the cause of your divorce. She just won't accept that. Sara doesn't have to like Cindy but she needs to understand that she needs to treat your wife with civility. Asking 'what's *she* doing here'  is not civility. You were right to stand up for your wife.\n\nAs a last ditch effort, you may want to try to have a conversation with Sara one on one to discuss her feelings. She's an adult now and has to realize that while you love her and want to keep her in your life, you won't tolerate her disrespect to you or Cindy.", "NTA. You can always unsay it.", "Info: what are everyone's ages?", "INFO: why did she call your wife a home wrecker?", "Info: have you ever asked Sarah why she is so mad or just had a good talk?", "NTA\n\nSounds like Sara thinks Cindy is the reason you and her mum split up.", "NTA. You already chose your future when you married Cindy. Your kids don't get to put such pressure on you. They do have the right to like or dislike anyone for any reason, but should respect your choice. You also forfeit any right to choose whether their partners are right or wrong for them, but you can advise them on what to look out for.\n\nIt's no benefit to you to tell your daughter to \"stay out of my life\" - I am taking that to mean you \"cut her off and disown her\". That is an emotional over-reaction that offers nothing, much like Will Smith smacking Chris Rock. But if you are asking her to keep her nose out of the choices you made, that is different and is a request to allow each person to make their own choices, for good or ill. But you need to be very clear with your words what you actually mean", "Cindy is older than me by 2 years so a 30ish age gap between the two", "I\u2019ve done this, didn\u2019t work", "I\u2019ll suggest that, thank you", "No", "2 years", "Wait but the daughter said her or me ?

Easier to assign blame in Sara's mind than to accept that reality is often boring. \n\nOP has done nothing wrong here, IMO. Literally, everyone else is good with this marriage besides Sara. Why would Sara be caught off guard by Cindy? When someone is married it's expected their partner would be there.  It's more surprising if they aren't.", "why would she feel threatened? makes no sense.", "> The correct response to an unreasonable ultimatum is to refuse to choose.\n\nActually the correct response to an ultimatum is to choose the person who didn't give you one.", "Me-53\nCindy-55\nEx wife-52\nOldest-28\nSara-24\nYoungest-22", "I\u2019m not with her mom anymore, it doesn\u2019t really make sense since I got with her 2 years after the divorce.", "Yes, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not mom.

Also he and ex-wife have clearly told Sara the causes for the divorce and that there was no cheating.", "Seriously? That's all you're going to reply with? No details? If that's typical of how you engage in communication, no wonder you two issues.... :-)\n\n*Listen Sara, until I can understand where all this hatred is coming from, I can't address it and it's going to continue to cause problems in our relationship. I'm not leaving Cindy. That much is certain. She didn't break up my marriage with your mom. That's also a fact. If I were to break up with Cindy for some unfathomable reason, I still wouldn't remarry your mom. That's also a fact. We're just not partners like a married couple should be and hadn't been for quite some time when we divorced. We fell out of love. It happens. Would it help if you, your mom, and myself sat down to talk this out?*", "Wait, she\u2019s 24? NTA! Your daughter needs therapy and to grow up.", "Does your daughter know that? Does your daughter think that new wife was the cause of the divorce? You need to talk with your ex how to proceed and have a conversation with you, your ex and daughter so she can understand what happened. She likely held some kind of hope that you and your ex would rekindle.\n\n Your comment about her \"accepting new wife or not being a part of your life\" likely caused  more harm so don't be surprised if she's not willing to talk to you.", "You daughter is very angry and is going after what she perceives as a \"safe\" target (Cindy) as opposed to who she is really angry at (you and your Ex). However, why she's so entrenched in the idea of your former marriage is being this inviolable i have no idea and likely would only become clear with therapy.  \n\n\n In terms of how to deal with it, I would just make it clear to her that being polite to Cindy at events you attend isn't optional. So she can either suck it up and attend family events or she be absent, but you won't tolerate disrespect to Cindy. And then hold those boundaries firm.", "Yeah, this sounds like your daughter has an issue and needs to grow up a little bit.

Good luck!", "Your daughter sounds awfully immature for (I assume) an adult.", "In another comment, I explained that both me and my ex has had this talk multiple times with her. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nI also explain that this most likely will be a problem with my ex wife when she starts dating\n\n\nWe have done this so many times, it didn\u2019t work", "She knows, we broke down why we are getting the divorce so many times. We made it very clear no one cheated", "I encourage family therapy between you and your daughter.
