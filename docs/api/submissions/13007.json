{"id": 13007, "submission_id": "11zmjlf", "title": "AITA for stopping a \u2018valuable community resource?\u2019", "selftext": "I\u2019m (37F). I live alone in a town in the US  which is about an hour and a bit\u2019s drive from the nearest city. So it\u2019s not completely cut off and there\u2019s a few thousand people that live here but if you want to make any major purchases or buy in bulk you need to go into the city.\n\nThroughout my 20s and my 30s, I had 4 miscarriages. I was warned I would be very unlikely to carry a child to term. I thought pregnancy number five when I was 32, was different as I made it past the second trimester. All scans were good, she was kicking and my husband and I were ecstatic. Sadly, my little girl was stillborn at 8 months. All the losses took its toll on me physically and mentally. I was explicitly told by my doctor that I should not try to get pregnant again. As painful as it was, when I was 34, I got a tubal litigation. I was just so defeated on paying thousands upon thousands in medical fees to never bring a baby home that at least if I willingly paid for a procedure, I couldn\u2019t be hurt if I was sterile. My marriage didn\u2019t survive. He left which I can\u2019t blame him for. We got divorced and I fell into a deep depression so I just started knitting.\n\nI kept knitting and knitting and decided to make baby clothes, hats and blankets and some toys. There\u2019s not a huge baby store nearby so I thought I could give a little back to the community and provide a service so people wouldn\u2019t have to travel if they didn\u2019t need to. I eventually branched out into making some knitted clothes for toddlers too. I was also never in it for the money, it was to distract me from the pain of the miscarriages, losing my daughter and my husband leaving. Whether they only bought one thing or multiple things, I only ever asked for $2 to help offset some of my costs and for a $5 donation to a local baby loss charity. So $7 no matter what you buy. People very rarely bought just one item cos why one if you can get more than that for the same price? Plus the charity is funded entirely through donations and they helped me a lot so I thought $5 for every transaction to help them would benefit them greatly.\n\nIt\u2019s been a success. It\u2019s saved some people money, it\u2019s given me some happiness and I\u2019m just happy I could provide. I lately had to raise my price by $3 to keep up with the demand cos of how successful it\u2019s been. So it\u2019s $10, that was still the same for one purchase or multiple items in one. I put out a message saying I was really sorry but that my costs have gone up a little bit so my prices have gone up slightly due to demand and because most people buy multiple items: I pay out a lot more of my own money anyway so I\u2019m not making any profit.\n\nI got so many negative comments saying that I should keep my prices the same or lower the charity donation and accusing me of being selfish that I just suspended my services. Whatever I had made that hasn\u2019t been sold, I just donated it and I put out another message saying I am no longer in business.\n\nI\u2019ve got even more backlash now saying I\u2019m taking away a valuable community resource getting stuff for babies and toddlers are expensive etc. I feel like maybe the price increase wasn\u2019t justified but at the same time, my sister told me they were still getting a good deal and I was doing this out of the kindness of my heart and they were using me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m mentally tired and exhausted. There is so much backlash that maybe they\u2019re right? I managed before on $2 so I probably could afford to get by so I don\u2019t know.\n\nI also got mostly negative comments, not overwhelmingly positive. I didn\u2019t have like hundreds or thousands of customers so it wasn\u2019t a wide base. I decided to stop completely as I\u2019m just done with it all.\n\nEdit 2: someone asked if I would benefit from a change of pace. Maybe. My husband left over 4 years ago and the divorce was finalised 3 years ago. I don\u2019t have a life. Even going out and doing stuff doesn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m fucking miserable and have been for what will soon be 6 years. I\u2019m gonna be 38 this year. I\u2019m pushing 40 and my life is just really really sad.", "created_utc": 1679582670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmjlf/aita_for_stopping_a_valuable_community_resource/", "score": 1228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't obligated to lose money indefinitely. You were doing a kindness, you have sole ownership over how to operate, where and when to operate, what to charge, etc. Anyone who is uncomfortable with the price simply can not buy.

You are not \"stopping\" a valuable resource, you ARE a valuable resource but you were treated like you weren't. \n\nIf you want to keep educating these people, put up a sign listing how much the yarn costs for each item and how many hours of your work it takes to knit one. The real value of even one handknit baby hat is somewhere between $70 and $100 even assuming minimum wage. A blanket should sell for upwards of $300. You were asking for $10 and they reacted like you were stealing money. These people don't deserve your time and effort. I know the therapeutic value of knitting so if you want to keep doing it, try selling closer to their real value and then donate whatever you can afford to the charity that you mentioned. I know it's hard to get real value for them, but you can definitely get much more and you know they'll go to people who value them instead of entitled AHs who think they're not worth more than $7. And you can still donate free clothes to people who need them and appreciate them.\n\nI am so sorry for what you had to go through. Please don't give up on finding ways to spread love in the world.

They're cheap assholes who were taking advantage of your generosity and kindness; and they repayed that kindness by bending over and shitting all over you. It's perfectly fair to no longer want any part of that. I would draft up a simple reply along the lines of; I apologize for the inconvenience this will cause; but due to increased material prices, demand, and time spent on projects I had to adjust my prices. Unfortunately, upon adjusting those prices the community made it clear that they were unable or unwilling to assist with these rising costs; and as such I am forced to put an end to my charitable work. As you are all clearly struggling financially as well, I sincerely hope you can empathize with my struggle during these trying times.'\nPeople don't fucking understand how much yarn costs; and how much time it takes to make these things.

Id bet group homes for teens would also accept items. Local churches might be able to suggest families who would appreciate anonymous donations of handcrafted gifts as well.\n\nThose places have folks who are much less likely to have access to lovingly made items, and are actual charities rather than rude people who are acting selfishly.\n\nYou arent obligated to continue crafting and donating - but if you find it helps you there are other options.

I wish I was your friend so I could give you a big hug", "These people sound like entitled assholes. You sound awesome. NTA and I hope you can go on a nice vacation or something to get perspective; these people don\u2019t deserve you and maybe being around people less entitled will remind you of that.", "NTA. You are doing something wonderful and kind, and I am sorry that some people are rude and entitled. Please do not let these negative comments deter you from the good you are doing.", "NTA at all!\n\n\nYou're a good and kind person\n\n\nInternet hugs from a stranger", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to your labor. People really don\u2019t understand just how much goes into handmade items. If they had to learn to knit, buy the materials, and make the items they\u2019d see than even your raised prices are dirt cheap. People are taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA", "You are still young and I'm only a few years older than you! You still got a life out there, just have to find it!\n\nThere was a book I read years ago of this woman that just decided to get on the bus and go somewhere.\n\nMaybe you can do something like that?\n\nEither way, I wish you luck on your next adventure!", "You are a lovely person! Sending you well wishes for your future, you deserve an amazing one!", "Screw them. I have an old friend that crochetes animals for kids. I pay FULL PRICE plus shipping, because I know she is a mom of 3 kids. And it's homemade... You can't beat that. True customers will pay", "NTA\n\nI think you're ready to start being around people now, rather than just making items.\n\nNot these people, though. Find some good ones.\n\nCan you join a hobby club or volunteer for something you might find fun or fullfilling?", "They're right. When you do something nice for people and they act ungrateful and demanding, you stop. That's how it works.\n\nNTA You're an adult with no children. Get some cats and dogs, travel, take bike trips, write a novel. The world is yours for the taking!", "NTA in any way whatsoever, and it makes me sad to think that you believe you could be the A. It sounds like you should find a therapist. I think your knitted clothes donation thing was admirable and impressive, and you don't owe them anything.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. And in no circumstances are you at fault. You were the valuable gem in that community that people took for granted. Your services are highly appreciated and I hope good things come your way.

Possibly some of these complainers were taking the items and reselling them for higher prices and were just unhappy that they wouldn't earn as much off of something that they should not have been taking just to sell in the first place.", "> You have been so generous with your time and money, and these people are insulting you because you want $10? \n\nIt used to be $9.\n\nPeople need to appreciate the value of what they're getting-- or pay a price that reflects the time and material costs of that item.", "Or a hospital! I\u2019ve seen people knitting items for NICU babies", "I think that this is a very very good point.", "My son got one when he was a year old.  He\u2019s 12 now and still sleeps with it.", "Poor thing. So dso sorry", "Do you have any resources available to help with your mental health? \n\nI'm so sorry for your losses. Just know that you deserve happiness as much as anyone. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. You could, and SHOULD, have been charging a LOT more than that from the beginning. Cost x3 is the basic rate people use. And it doesn\u2019t pay you for your time and knowledge.", "I wish I could give you a very strong hug, OP. Thank you for the generous service you have been providing. This is so incredibly kind of you!!! NTA. Not in the least. Please take good care of yourself. I completely understand why you do not wish to continue. Please know that there is nothing - absolutely nothing - wrong with raising the price given how expensive everything has gotten over the past couple of years. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. People are treating you horribly. Forget about this and invest in an activity that brings at least a little joy.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nThe community didn't value the valuable community resource that you were doing. They have themselves to blame. You did an amazing goodness for others and you're appreciated when it came time to raise prices by **$3.** Don't ever feel guilty.", "NTA, your \u201ccommunity\u201d is full of selfish pricks who only thinks about themselves.", "NTA \"give the charity less\" ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'm glad you closed up shop but you need to move. Sounds like making baby cloths and staying in the same place has keep your life and grief at the same place.

Everything that happened to you is not your fault. Horrible shit happens, it's life. \n\nYou are a good person. You deserve happiness. Don't let others tear you down. You have survived horrible heart wrenching losses. But you've survived and were happy knitting. That means you can be happy again. And again. And again. \n\nYou deserve to laugh and smile.

Do you realize how rare that is? How special you are? \nI\u2019m so sorry for your losses and that people have been hassling you. I bet there are even more people who appreciate you but, in my experience, they just don\u2019t speak up as often.", "Nta.", "Not sure what first part of story has to do with it?", "Nta. They had a good deal and then decided to fuss and be selfish. That not on you. That's on them.", "NTA- \n\nPeople are sometimes AHs. \n\nHandmade textiles are EXPENSIVE and your prices were beyond low... 10 dollars an item is beyond low. \n\n\nAnd you were doing it mostly for charity... So not even your own benefit. \n\nBow you feel like you want to do something else. Like the stress of making items and being called horrible for puting out cheap accessible baby garments is too much. That's fair. \n\nIt's okay to move on. You're NTA, at all.", "Also I promise plenty of people would still be happy to pay your prices", "I agree! You were literally doing something out of the kindness of your heart.

They complained no matter what. So now as a result of not supporting your kindness they have to drive far for clothes.

I just ask because I know some of these organizations have programs like this, but it\u2019s run through the org and they offset the costs etc. \n\nAlso because I know people who have gone through what you have and joining bereavement organizations helped them find support and empathy and healing. \n\nIf it\u2019s not for you, I totally understand. It\u2019s just something to ponder.", "Great suggestions \ud83d\ude00", "Absolutely agree with this. \n\nMaaaaybe $3 would cover the yarn for a bonnet, if you want till the primary-coloured polyester goes on sale in a supermarket. Anything in nicer colours, never mind better material, is going to cost more ime.\nAnything bigger, even in polyester is not going to have its costs covered.\n\nThen there's the physical labour of creating these pieces.\n\nOP there's also the huge emotional grace you've shown... working through your grief over your loss by offering help to people who are experiencing what you yearn for. I think that's so incredibly kind of you.", "When I was a kid, I had an appendectomy, so nothing incredibly unusual, but regardless I was scared and in a lot of pain.

She does beautiful work and the hospital really appreciates her kindness."]}
