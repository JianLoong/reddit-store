{"id": 13007, "submission_id": "11zmjlf", "title": "AITA for stopping a \u2018valuable community resource?\u2019", "selftext": "I\u2019m (37F). I live alone in a town in the US  which is about an hour and a bit\u2019s drive from the nearest city. So it\u2019s not completely cut off and there\u2019s a few thousand people that live here but if you want to make any major purchases or buy in bulk you need to go into the city.\n\nThroughout my 20s and my 30s, I had 4 miscarriages. I was warned I would be very unlikely to carry a child to term. I thought pregnancy number five when I was 32, was different as I made it past the second trimester. All scans were good, she was kicking and my husband and I were ecstatic. Sadly, my little girl was stillborn at 8 months. All the losses took its toll on me physically and mentally. I was explicitly told by my doctor that I should not try to get pregnant again. As painful as it was, when I was 34, I got a tubal litigation. I was just so defeated on paying thousands upon thousands in medical fees to never bring a baby home that at least if I willingly paid for a procedure, I couldn\u2019t be hurt if I was sterile. My marriage didn\u2019t survive. He left which I can\u2019t blame him for. We got divorced and I fell into a deep depression so I just started knitting.\n\nI kept knitting and knitting and decided to make baby clothes, hats and blankets and some toys. There\u2019s not a huge baby store nearby so I thought I could give a little back to the community and provide a service so people wouldn\u2019t have to travel if they didn\u2019t need to. I eventually branched out into making some knitted clothes for toddlers too. I was also never in it for the money, it was to distract me from the pain of the miscarriages, losing my daughter and my husband leaving. Whether they only bought one thing or multiple things, I only ever asked for $2 to help offset some of my costs and for a $5 donation to a local baby loss charity. So $7 no matter what you buy. People very rarely bought just one item cos why one if you can get more than that for the same price? Plus the charity is funded entirely through donations and they helped me a lot so I thought $5 for every transaction to help them would benefit them greatly.\n\nIt\u2019s been a success. It\u2019s saved some people money, it\u2019s given me some happiness and I\u2019m just happy I could provide. I lately had to raise my price by $3 to keep up with the demand cos of how successful it\u2019s been. So it\u2019s $10, that was still the same for one purchase or multiple items in one. I put out a message saying I was really sorry but that my costs have gone up a little bit so my prices have gone up slightly due to demand and because most people buy multiple items: I pay out a lot more of my own money anyway so I\u2019m not making any profit.\n\nI got so many negative comments saying that I should keep my prices the same or lower the charity donation and accusing me of being selfish that I just suspended my services. Whatever I had made that hasn\u2019t been sold, I just donated it and I put out another message saying I am no longer in business.\n\nI\u2019ve got even more backlash now saying I\u2019m taking away a valuable community resource getting stuff for babies and toddlers are expensive etc. I feel like maybe the price increase wasn\u2019t justified but at the same time, my sister told me they were still getting a good deal and I was doing this out of the kindness of my heart and they were using me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m mentally tired and exhausted. There is so much backlash that maybe they\u2019re right? I managed before on $2 so I probably could afford to get by so I don\u2019t know.\n\nI also got mostly negative comments, not overwhelmingly positive. I didn\u2019t have like hundreds or thousands of customers so it wasn\u2019t a wide base. I decided to stop completely as I\u2019m just done with it all.", "created_utc": 1679582670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmjlf/aita_for_stopping_a_valuable_community_resource/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't obligated to lose money indefinitely. You were doing a kindness, you have sole ownership over how to operate, where and when to operate, what to charge, etc. Anyone who is uncomfortable with the price simply can not buy. It's shocking that you'd receive criticism like this and frankly you were right to shut it down. You can always start an etsy-based or craft fair-based business with a different model. You had a NET POSITIVE impact on your community, and there is zero obligation for you to keep it going.", "NTA. You are not \"stopping\" a valuable resource, you ARE a valuable resource but you were treated like you weren't. \n\nIf you want to keep educating these people, put up a sign listing how much the yarn costs for each item and how many hours of your work it takes to knit one. The real value of even one handknit baby hat is somewhere between $70 and $100 even assuming minimum wage. A blanket should sell for upwards of $300. You were asking for $10 and they reacted like you were stealing money. These people don't deserve your time and effort. I know the therapeutic value of knitting so if you want to keep doing it, try selling closer to their real value and then donate whatever you can afford to the charity that you mentioned. I know it's hard to get real value for them, but you can definitely get much more and you know they'll go to people who value them instead of entitled AHs who think they're not worth more than $7. And you can still donate free clothes to people who need them and appreciate them.\n\nI am so sorry for what you had to go through. Please don't give up on finding ways to spread love in the world. Just don't forget to love yourself too, and don't put up with people who don't respect you.", "NTA\n\nYou are not a \"valuable community resource\" you are a person who chose to use your time and resources to do something kind.

They're cheap assholes who were taking advantage of your generosity and kindness; and they repayed that kindness by bending over and shitting all over you. It's perfectly fair to no longer want any part of that. I would draft up a simple reply along the lines of; I apologize for the inconvenience this will cause; but due to increased material prices, demand, and time spent on projects I had to adjust my prices. Unfortunately, upon adjusting those prices the community made it clear that they were unable or unwilling to assist with these rising costs; and as such I am forced to put an end to my charitable work. As you are all clearly struggling financially as well, I sincerely hope you can empathize with my struggle during these trying times.'\nPeople don't fucking understand how much yarn costs; and how much time it takes to make these things.

They sound very entitled. I wonder if you could do a \"sponsorship\" and people could donate $10 to you and that would buy a piece of clothing to someone that can't afford it.

Absolutely not.\n\nIts no wonder kind people have to suffer, because of how much their kindness is taken for granted and used and misused.\n\nIf it's a community resource then let the community pitch in along with you, and that means a 3$ additional cost. Why is one single person expected to not only take the cost burden, the making it burden and then the burden of backlash.", "NTA- there are far to many entitled people out there. You did this to help people and give yourself peace.

You were doing something wonderful for the community. And yarn is expensive! The donation and tiny fee were the very least to ask.\n\nUnfortunately it's the mean people who are vocal.

I can understand if you are just entirely burnt out on anything like this but, if you want to do something kind of similar without having anything to do with these ungrateful jerks, you might want to look into the Loose Ends project.

I think you were right to end your efforts there.\n\n... it also sounds that you aren't ready to let go of the idea of helping with *something*, to honor your little lost one.\n\nThere are a lot of [legitimate charities](https://www.verywellfamily.com/miscarriage-support-organizations-2371339) which help those who *do* need help, going through situations very much like the one you went through.\n\nMaybe there's a way you could help there. For example, I remember when I lost my own daughter, almost 2 decades ago, we had problems finding something appropriate to dress her in for burial. She was too tiny even for preemie clothing. Doll clothing wouldn't properly fit around her lil arms. A very dear family friend ended up knitting her a dress. I was lucky to have that friend. It's all I could think of reading your post/comments. Maybe you could do something like that, if it would help you.\n\nYou could even offset the cost, possibly, by getting a local church or charity involved. When I was making teddy bears for the local children's hospital, my church supplied all the fabric I needed.\n\nAnyway, just a thought if it helps *you*. \n\nYou don't owe those greedy, selfish people anything.\n\nAnd I hope this mess doesn't set back your grief recovery. You did a beautiful thing. I'm sorry it went all haywire.", "That's heartbreaking. I'm so sorry for your loss. This stranger is sending you an internet hug.", "The more of your comments I read, the more I want to ream out some entitled assholes. You're just so NICE; I HATE that You're being treated to badly when you sound like the Mr. Rodgers of baby clothes.", "The comments are heartless and ungrateful. What you did was amazing, and they should be thankful you didn\u2019t charge more to begin with. You already suffered more losses than one person should, you don\u2019t need to continue taking a financial loss for ungrateful jerks!", "You did this to help with your mental health.  It\u2019s not, so don\u2019t.", "Nah. Fuck that. You're an artist and your art has value. If it's a 'valuable community resource' than someone can start a gofundme so the community can fucking support YOU as well. You are also a part of the community and should be treated. As. Such.", "No! Give yourself a break.", "Please please believe me when I say YOU'RE NTA AT ALL \n\nTHEY ARE ENTITLED AND THEY CALLED YOU A \"RESOURCE\".\n\nYOU'RE NOT A PERSON TO THEM WITH ACTUAL FEELINGS BUT \"RESOURCE\"\n\nMaybe enquire about the shelters and charities or like program run for children where you can help if you want to help people or make a non profit and sell your items there where you charge for the materials and little bit making charge and donate the rest like a website or something\n\nYou don't need to give to these ENTITLED people", "Completely agree with this suggestion! I'm also a knitter and often give yarn away to a friend who knits for prem babies.  If you could find a knitting group I'm certain there would be people there who would be delighted to gift you spare yarn to allow you to make things for charity.  Don't let the selfish people of this world get you down."]}
