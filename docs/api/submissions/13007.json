{"id": 13007, "submission_id": "11zmjlf", "title": "AITA for stopping a \u2018valuable community resource?\u2019", "selftext": "I\u2019m (37F). I live alone in a town in the US  which is about an hour and a bit\u2019s drive from the nearest city. So it\u2019s not completely cut off and there\u2019s a few thousand people that live here but if you want to make any major purchases or buy in bulk you need to go into the city.\n\nThroughout my 20s and my 30s, I had 4 miscarriages. I was warned I would be very unlikely to carry a child to term. I thought pregnancy number five when I was 32, was different as I made it past the second trimester. All scans were good, she was kicking and my husband and I were ecstatic. Sadly, my little girl was stillborn at 8 months. All the losses took its toll on me physically and mentally. I was explicitly told by my doctor that I should not try to get pregnant again. As painful as it was, when I was 34, I got a tubal litigation. I was just so defeated on paying thousands upon thousands in medical fees to never bring a baby home that at least if I willingly paid for a procedure, I couldn\u2019t be hurt if I was sterile. My marriage didn\u2019t survive. He left which I can\u2019t blame him for. We got divorced and I fell into a deep depression so I just started knitting.\n\nI kept knitting and knitting and decided to make baby clothes, hats and blankets and some toys. There\u2019s not a huge baby store nearby so I thought I could give a little back to the community and provide a service so people wouldn\u2019t have to travel if they didn\u2019t need to. I eventually branched out into making some knitted clothes for toddlers too. I was also never in it for the money, it was to distract me from the pain of the miscarriages, losing my daughter and my husband leaving. Whether they only bought one thing or multiple things, I only ever asked for $2 to help offset some of my costs and for a $5 donation to a local baby loss charity. So $7 no matter what you buy. People very rarely bought just one item cos why one if you can get more than that for the same price? Plus the charity is funded entirely through donations and they helped me a lot so I thought $5 for every transaction to help them would benefit them greatly.\n\nIt\u2019s been a success. It\u2019s saved some people money, it\u2019s given me some happiness and I\u2019m just happy I could provide. I lately had to raise my price by $3 to keep up with the demand cos of how successful it\u2019s been. So it\u2019s $10, that was still the same for one purchase or multiple items in one. I put out a message saying I was really sorry but that my costs have gone up a little bit so my prices have gone up slightly due to demand and because most people buy multiple items: I pay out a lot more of my own money anyway so I\u2019m not making any profit.\n\nI got so many negative comments saying that I should keep my prices the same or lower the charity donation and accusing me of being selfish that I just suspended my services. Whatever I had made that hasn\u2019t been sold, I just donated it and I put out another message saying I am no longer in business.\n\nI\u2019ve got even more backlash now saying I\u2019m taking away a valuable community resource getting stuff for babies and toddlers are expensive etc. I feel like maybe the price increase wasn\u2019t justified but at the same time, my sister told me they were still getting a good deal and I was doing this out of the kindness of my heart and they were using me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m mentally tired and exhausted. There is so much backlash that maybe they\u2019re right? I managed before on $2 so I probably could afford to get by so I don\u2019t know.\n\nI also got mostly negative comments, not overwhelmingly positive. I didn\u2019t have like hundreds or thousands of customers so it wasn\u2019t a wide base. I decided to stop completely as I\u2019m just done with it all.", "created_utc": 1679582670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmjlf/aita_for_stopping_a_valuable_community_resource/", "score": 521, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't obligated to lose money indefinitely. You were doing a kindness, you have sole ownership over how to operate, where and when to operate, what to charge, etc. Anyone who is uncomfortable with the price simply can not buy. It's shocking that you'd receive criticism like this and frankly you were right to shut it down. You can always start an etsy-based or craft fair-based business with a different model.

You are not \"stopping\" a valuable resource, you ARE a valuable resource but you were treated like you weren't. \n\nIf you want to keep educating these people, put up a sign listing how much the yarn costs for each item and how many hours of your work it takes to knit one. The real value of even one handknit baby hat is somewhere between $70 and $100 even assuming minimum wage. A blanket should sell for upwards of $300. You were asking for $10 and they reacted like you were stealing money. These people don't deserve your time and effort. I know the therapeutic value of knitting so if you want to keep doing it, try selling closer to their real value and then donate whatever you can afford to the charity that you mentioned. I know it's hard to get real value for them, but you can definitely get much more and you know they'll go to people who value them instead of entitled AHs who think they're not worth more than $7. And you can still donate free clothes to people who need them and appreciate them.\n\nI am so sorry for what you had to go through. Please don't give up on finding ways to spread love in the world.

They're cheap assholes who were taking advantage of your generosity and kindness; and they repayed that kindness by bending over and shitting all over you. It's perfectly fair to no longer want any part of that. I would draft up a simple reply along the lines of; I apologize for the inconvenience this will cause; but due to increased material prices, demand, and time spent on projects I had to adjust my prices. Unfortunately, upon adjusting those prices the community made it clear that they were unable or unwilling to assist with these rising costs; and as such I am forced to put an end to my charitable work. As you are all clearly struggling financially as well, I sincerely hope you can empathize with my struggle during these trying times.'\nPeople don't fucking understand how much yarn costs; and how much time it takes to make these things.

Absolutely not.\n\nIts no wonder kind people have to suffer, because of how much their kindness is taken for granted and used and misused.\n\nIf it's a community resource then let the community pitch in along with you, and that means a 3$ additional cost.

I can understand if you are just entirely burnt out on anything like this but, if you want to do something kind of similar without having anything to do with these ungrateful jerks, you might want to look into the Loose Ends project.

Id bet group homes for teens would also accept items. Local churches might be able to suggest families who would appreciate anonymous donations of handcrafted gifts as well.\n\nThose places have folks who are much less likely to have access to lovingly made items, and are actual charities rather than rude people who are acting selfishly.\n\nYou arent obligated to continue crafting and donating - but if you find it helps you there are other options. And since yarn doesnt go bad you can stockpile and just donate any time you go into a bigger city.\n\nYou might also find that there are crafting groups where folks like you get together and plan out whats being made and for what charity. There's a facebook group for that in my city, and we arent a big city. Or, you could start a facebook group or an in person meet up.

They are being greedy and should learn to make some baby clothes for two dollars if they really have an issue with it.", "Definitely. I knit, too, and it\u2019s disgraceful that people are being so disrespectful to you. NTA.", "Of course, this is completely absurd. These people are idiots. Don't waste a thought about them.", "I'm so sorry", "Sweetheart, you've done nothing wrong. You are the epitome of an easy NTA. I'd like to light a candle for your daughter tonight, and the others you've lost of course too. If you named them, and are comfortable sharing any of the names, I'll whisper them over the flames as I light them, but no pressure to respond to such a sensitive question. As a mom of two sweet girls, your words just really hit me, and I'd like to honor your children's memories. Their memories will always be a blessing.", "Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a", "I don't even think the cost of the yarn was covered. Yarn isn't cheap, and sometimes it takes way more than 1 to finish an article of clothing. And they could buy as many as they wanted for a flat price, so they were getting a bargain. OP was really doing them a huge favor even with the price increase. They were taking advantage and all of those negative posts caused op to decide not to do it anymore. I don't think OP should continue if all she's gonna get is negative comments. They can buy from big retail stores and see how expensive these items really are.", "Same. OP dm me some names if you want, I'm down to get banned from Facebook. Fuck these entitled cretins.", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Shodfghkjd) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmjlf/aita_for_stopping_a_valuable_community_resource/jdd42us/)", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Wdenstome) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmjlf/aita_for_stopping_a_valuable_community_resource/jddw85m/)", "God I love when an asshole offers their services in support of a sweetheart; it\u2019s so wholesome. (Note: as another asshole, that word is meant entirely as a compliment.) Nothing like a good ol Hufflepuff-Slytherin partnership."]}
