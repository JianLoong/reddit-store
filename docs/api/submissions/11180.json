So I don\u2019t try to tell him too much about work and when I do he seems to get more annoyed. Last week I met with my boss and she told me I got a 28% raise and I\u2019m now tech lead for my team. I had been acting tech lead for a few months when our current one was on paternity leave but now the team is expanding and we need 2 leads.

I never told my mom not to say anything because she is a super private person and I never expected her to make a big deal of it. But she called my bf to tell him to bring me to a restaurant so we can celebrate together. My bf found out that way about 8 days from me getting the news and is now pissed.

That's draining. It's pretty fucked up of him to put you in a situation like that. This is for sure a red flag.", "NTA. If you're too afraid to tell your boyfriend something awesome because he'll ridicule you for it, then it's time to shut this shit down. You should not even be with this person.", "NTA.  It's a bad sign when you withhold information  from your partner because you dread how they will react.

That should be a big fucking hint.\n\nPlus instead of inspecting himself when you tell him what the issue is, he's *arguing*. He's not going to change because he has decided there is no issue beyond *your* actions.", "Wow NTA for sure. If your partner has given you any indication that they are anything less than excited for your accomplishments then they honestly aren't for you! His resentment and jealousy has no place in a healthy relationship. You don't need to cover your light to make others seem brighter! Support goes both ways. If he's not happy about his job then he can put his energy into getting a different one, supporting you in other ways so you can excel at yours even more (household tasks, cooking for you, doing errands, etc.) because he benefits from you doing well and he needs to recognize the that or get out! Congrats to you, it sounds like you are crushing it and should be celebrated.", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is. You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells because you're happy with your job. I understand working at a place you dislike, but that doesn't mean he has to be pissed off at you because you have your dream job. You might want to rethink your relationship with a guy who can't get over himself long enough to support and be happy for you.", "NAH you both have a communication issue. If you're scared to tell your partner when something good happens, then something is wrong and you need to talk about it. If they have a problem with your success, that's a whole other issue.", "NTA\n\nI think that both of you should feel comfortable talking about your jobs without the other calling it bragging. It sounds like he is just wanting to be upset about your job either way. Like no matter what, if you tell him he will feel its bragging after he tells you how much he hates his job and if you wait to share things for a better day for him he gets upset. Its a lose lose situation. \n\nCongrats on the raise and promotion by the way. That should be something to be happy about as it will further your financial stability and make life more comfortable for you in the future.", "NTA OP - and I just want to share something quickly:\n\nIn one of my early relationships, my then partner only reacted positively to my good news if they were in a good place themselves. Otherwise it was much of the same - my accomplishments and successes brought out frustration, annoyance, and sadness in them. I thought that was normal.\n\nIn my current relationship, my partner is thrilled for me when I achieve something. They currently despise their job - truly hate it (as they should, it\u2019s a terrible environment). But any work wins I have? A recent promotion? Great bonus? Every time, they\u2019ve been my biggest cheerleader. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is the right partner sees your wins as their wins.

Having to hide joy is kind of sad though.  \n\nBig congratulations on your promotion!", "ESH - \n\nYou obviously didn't tell your BF about something important in your life, something so important you told everyone else. \n\nIMO, your relationship is dead.  Take this as a red flag and move on.", "NTA I dated a guy for two years when I was young. I really liked him a lot. But he became resentful of me. I started not sharing things with him. I found it exhausting being around him and I found myself justifying everything over and over. Then one day I listened to myself justifying just being me and I thought this is crazy. I should be comfortable in who I am and not constantly downplaying everything because he has a huge chip on his shoulder. My aunt noticed an interaction and later said, do not marry a man who thinks he is beneath you. He will make you suffer for it for the rest of your life. I had to admit to myself she was right and dumped him. He married another girl and did nothing but constantly whine all day long to her with a woe is me act.", "Soft YTA, only for dating a man that doesn\u2019t support you. Your partner is supposed to be your biggest cheerleader. You chose to hide your raise because he\u2019s shown you that he\u2019s jealous of you/your career. The two of you are supposed to be a team - your wins are supposed to be his wins, and vice versa. I understand that he\u2019s unhappy at his job, and that really does suck, but if he can\u2019t be happy for you then I don\u2019t see this relationship working out.", "OP, you are censoring yourself with your boyfriend to preserve his ego and avoid him being hurtful towards you.\n\nPlease read that sentence again and think about whether you really want that to be your relationship.

So he denies it to himself.  Take it from someone who's been there.  It never works, denying our irrational human feelings.\n\nI'd recommend he get therapy to work on expressing those very natural human feelings in a constructive way.  Before the feelings eat him alive.  \n\nI'm assuming his \"you don't think highly of me\" is him projecting how **he** feels about **himself**.  He feels like a failure because he's not working in a white collar job.    But I don't think he's being an AH, per se.  He just needs professional help.", "NTA  it was never his business to begin with as a bf.", "NTA. BUT - I am currently the boyfriend in the situation. I hate my job and feel underpaid, undervalued, etc etc etc. I\u2019ll admit that sometimes I feel a little resentful and sad because I wish I was as happy and fulfilled as my partner in my job. At the same time, he always tells me about successes, raises, etc because he knows at the end of the day I support him and if he is happy and celebrating, so am I. \n\nI\u2019m not perfect and I\u2019m sure sometimes he feels bad about having success at work when I\u2019m struggling, but he and I both know at the end of the day that his success in his career in *no way* has to do with my struggles.\n\nI would encourage you to think about whether this is a recurring behavior - do you often feel as though you can\u2019t be happy if he\u2019s unhappy? You are not at fault for not telling him, but it sounds, based on you\u2019re saying, that he\u2019s always annoyed when things are going well for you, that this may not be the healthiest relationship.", "NTA. It\u2019s really simple. If you can\u2019t tell your partner about your financial circumstances then you aren\u2019t partners", "INFO: which is it, then? Do you know for a fact that he's jealous and resentful of your employment situation, or is it something you believe to be true?\n\nThere's a big difference, and in your post you're constantly switching between the two.\n\nBut well, not letting him know after more than a week is not a good idea - however much people on here will parrot the thought that no one is entitled to know your financial situation, willful obfuscation of the changes in your life will rarely be well received by those with whom you're supposed to be close to.", "NTA. I don't understand why a significant other wouldn't be excited and celebrate of your achievement. If he really hates his job so much the point that he can't even be happy for you doing well then he needs to find a different job.", "ESH. I think you need to reevaluate your relationship with him. In a loving partnership ones person's success should be both of yours. If he is resentful of your success to the point where you don't feel like you can share your happiness with him, what kind of relationship is that? And if he is unable to separate his career from your success and be happy/proud of your accomplishments, what kind of partner is he? Tbh you should have been the one to tell your bf about your promotion instead of him finding out from others. And if he loves you, he should be mature enough to respect and celebrate your success regardless of the challenges in his own career path.", "NAH. it is so not your business to tip-toe around a grown man's feelings and hide your own accomplishments on account of his resentment. healthy partners don't react that way, even if they may be sad about their own shortcomings they would put your success and happiness first. If there have been snide comments or general remarks he's made about your job vs him then he's clearly not supporting you enough as a romantic partner, but if you're ASSUMING that that's how he feels then I think you should also communicate to him more.", "ESH. The fact that you felt the need to lie/withhold info from your boyfriend to protect his feelies is a red flag for the relationship. He should be happy for you and you should be excited to tell him, that's how a healthy relationship is supposed to work.", "NAT - Based on how you described the situation, I can't fault you for feeling the way you do and hesitating to share the news. That being said, you guys need to talk things out and your bf needs to work on his issues. Part of a healthy relationship is being happy for your partner's success and accomplishments, not resenting their success relative to your own. Your partner should be one of the first people you want to tell about something like this, rather than literally hiding your happiness because you feel you have to walk on eggshells around them.", "Not really an AH but, having been in his position, he is. You should be happy for your partner even when your job sucks. You did great and should be able to share wonderful things with him without feeling guilt over being happy. It\u2019s really messed up to feel bad about that. Talk to him about it. You cannot both be miserable. Ask what he wants to do and help him make a plan for it. If he would prefer to stay at his job and unhappy, that\u2019s on him and consider if you want to keep living like this.", "NTA  for all the reasons others have pointed out - jealousy, resentment, etc.\n\nBut might you be able to bolster his self-image by pointing out that his education is ideal for today's mechanic?   Cars are less about greasing wheel bearings and more and more about electronics wizardry.   It's a well-compensated job for which he would seem to be a good fit.  He shouldn't feel he's stuck, say, in a dead-end useless career.", "ESH. You definitely should've told him, because that's something you need to be able to tell your partner, but there's a reason you didn't want to tell him. This didn't happen in a vacuum. His behavior has led you to feel and behave as if you're not allowed to be happy in your job when you're around him, and that's not healthy for you or the relationship. Something to examine deeper for you both, for sure", ">he has been working a crappy job he hates as a mechanic \n\nHe does seem to hate it, but a mechanic is not a \"crappy\" job. Most of this post seems to be you talking about how incredible your job is while making sure to point out how terrible his is.\n\n> He argued I\u2019m just imagining him being pissed of and he would have been happy for me but he knows I don\u2019t think highly of him. \n\nThis seems to be true... \n\nI guess I lean ESH, him for allowing work to put him into a negative mind space so consistently, but also you for just assuming he is envious of your job to the point you didn't tell him about a promotion for over a week. If he is telling you that he would have been happy, there is not much reason to not trust that, he just seems hurt. You almost seem to **want** him to be bitter, because he is telling you directly he is not and yet you still push that.", "I feel uncomfortable rendering any judgement and here's why: You seem very focused on your job and the incredibleness of it. When someone else (such as your bf) doesn't enjoy their job, you are much more likely to project feelings onto them. He may seem resentful, but he may just not want to hear you telling him how awesome your job is while he had a really rough day at work and is trying to find something better but can't. that's completely understandable. there's a difference between being careful what you tell him about, and not telling him you got a promotion. I think that in a case like this phrasing and exactly how these situations go down really matters, and it's imposisble to render a fair judgement with the info provided and able to be provided.", "Soft YTA. \n\nDid you plan to keep it from him forever? You had to figure that he'd learn about the moolah and promotion at some point, especially as you were so happy when you told others about it. \n\nI get it. You tried to spare his feelings, but long term, there really was no way to keep this from him, and he really should have heard it from you.", "Uh you shouldn't understand him resenting you, you should not resent your partner because they have a \"better\" job - you should be happy, proud, and grateful, elsewhere you need to leave them to their happiness or get therapy. Never make your trash feelings their responsibility. \n\nESH\n\nWhy are you with this dude tho? He sounds hateful and grumpy. You can't even celebrate your good news with him? I mean it's your life but that's sad \n\nYou're an ass for lieing by omission. You basically know your bf is a bum tho so this is the man you chose", "I think you are maybe 5-10% TA for not telling him and assuming what his reaction would be. Now it's hypothetical, with him saying he would've been happy for you, and you remembering him walking away and accusing you of bragging.\n\nI think those who think YTA are basing that opinion on him being your \"partner\" and you therefore owe him full disclosure in everything. In my opinion, you don't owe him anything. You live separately and don't share finances. He's a guy you've been dating for a year. In that year you've seen behavior from him that led you to the choice of not telling him.\n\nUnsolicited advice, ditch him and find someone who can be happy for you when you have good fortune. He sounds like a big baby.", "YTA. Milestones should be shared with partners. You kept it from him because you didn't think he could handle hearing about your success. Do you realize how infantilizing that is?\n\nDid you ever consider hearing about your good news might improve his day?\n\nIf you can't share the basic good news of your life with a partner, then you shouldn't be with that person.  \n\nIf you told him, and he wasn't excited for you, then you'd know the relationship was over. But now you'll never know because you deprived him of that chance by thinking you could control him by concealing information.", "YTA for not telling him. And if you go on to him about your job and his like you did in this post no wonder he gets upset. But it sounds liking you\u2019ve been doing a lot of assuming.", "YTA.  You projected on him his feelings, which he told you that you were wrong about.  Don't know why you chose to do that, but you did.  He called it out, accurately.  Also, he apparently doesn't like you to brag, so that was good information for you; perhaps there is an issue with \\*you\\* and a superiority complex you have.  Worth exploring between you.\n\nThere is, after all, a difference between being happy about something and bragging about it.  The latter is a result of a need for ups/props/wanting credit for something.  The former is just simply stating facts without taking credit for it.  If you don't think what you did was \"bragging,\" again, a matter worthy of discussion.\n\nAnd, he knows you don't think highly of him, which appears to be an accurate assessment.  That was good information to feed back to you.  Up to you what to do with it, but based on my reading here, you shouldn't just ignore it.  It seems he is picking up on something accurately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I remember how it feels to have your parade rained on from your partner like that. with time and perspective I say it didn't get any better without a lot of honest conversation about those feelings and her finding her own success, or more apt her own definition of it, we both grew from that, but we grew apart.\n\n ego can make people shitty, but you shouldn't need to do that with the people you have close, you do need to talk about it and take away it's power.\n\ndon't let that emotional debt accumulate in your relationship base", "Exactly- as someone with a toxic ex, he would always put down my accomplishments and make me feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough. Red flag indeed.", "This is the answer you need. \n\nI'll give you my point of view. I lost my job a few years ago and decided to go back to school for something I realized I was passionate about and move industries. This was very scary. I am not a spring chicken..the problem was that job was event planning \ud83d\ude43 \n\nIn the meantime my bf started a small business. I joined the business. Though we were successful a series of bad luck has left us very financially stapped for years including now. My best friend has a business too that is extremely successful. \n\nI will admit something that makes me ashamed. Some days I'm very jealous. It's hard to hear about the business flourishing and the cash rolling in. But that is MY PROBLEM that I KEEP TO MYSELF. Not once have I ever said anything or made my friend feel she can't share her successes with me. I will gladly celebrate all my loved ones successes, even if I'm struggling. You are allowed to feel sad that you aren't where you want to be. It is a whole other thing to be so outwardly miserable that YOUR PARTNER feels she has to hide A RAISE because she doesn't want to make you feel bad", "agreed! However it could also be they love to complain and crap on people because they feel they have a bad hand and they also refuse to actively change their situation. My ex was like this, She had a job she hated and yet refused to do anything and worked the bare minimum. She got opportunities to work overseas and refused to do so and take them and then complained about how bad life is and how everything is against her. Some people are just energy vampires and love to be miserable as that's their thing.", "OP you\u2019re NTA don\u2019t be a th someone who can\u2019t even be excited for your success. Heck my husband is you atm with this store ownership as for me I\u2019m kinda like your BF lol but the major difference is that I totally support my husband. I\u2019m currently working hard to improve myself and get to where I want to be so I made choices that can get me there. Your BF needs to make changes for himself and not blame you for his short comings \n\nYou deserve better and I think you need to be aggressive for your self worth. But I agree there\u2019s marina flags happening lol", "This. It's a red flag if you don't feel like you can share this amazing news with him when it happens. Somethings wrong and you shouldn't have to tip toe around him. If he were a decent partner he would be excited and elated for you, no matter his own work situation.", "100% this. OP, this should be a huge wake up call for you. Do you want a partner you can\u2019t share good news with? I appreciate that he hates his job, but no, that doesn\u2019t give him license to treat you this way.", "I wondered about that too, every engineering place I know is desperate for people.", "We can\u2019t find enough EE\u2019s and the college o went to told me every student graduates with a job lined up already. Low attendance at job fairs since they all have jobs already", "He denies he is resentful but I think he is. So one example of me bragging is we both got sick with covid and we were pretty sick. He asked his boss for some sick time and his boss said he had to come into work. They argued back and forth until he got a doctors note and could take 3 days off. He said I shouldn\u2019t bother asking my work for time off because I work from home. He thought they will just make me work because I\u2019m already isolated. But I ignored him and asked anyway because I know my boss is decent. When I told her I got covid and needed time off she said of course let me know when you feel better and didn\u2019t bother me until I went back to work 10 days later. My bf got annoyed when I told him I got time off and told me I was \u201cbragging\u201d and \u201cbeing annoying\u201d because when he asked if I was getting paid or unpaid time off I said it was paid when he was going to get unpaid time off and had to argue with his boss about getting time off. He was still sick when he went back to work and his coworkers kept telling him to go home but he couldn\u2019t.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily saying that, it could be a crappy job because the hours and pay suck, not because it isn\u2019t skilled labor or a respectable job", "You may want to separate the y t a letters so they don't count as a judgment.", "So him telling her that she\u2019s \u201cbragging\u201d when she\u2019s talking about her job isn\u2019t enough of a clue? I agree she prob shouldn\u2019t be with someone she can\u2019t share this type of news with though. \n\nNAH - he\u2019s right to be annoyed - but I think you know why you didn\u2019t tell him and that says a lot about your feelings.", "Y\u2019all, I found the BF.", "100% NTA. OP deserves someone who will want to celebrate her successes with her.", "Dump him. Life is too short.", "I said it was crappy because he called it that many times.", "Could also be crappy because it's not what he wants to be doing. OP said he went to school for something else, and wants to do that. But is having a hard time finding work in that field.", "I don't understand. This whole sub is about judging, isn't it?\n\nAs for putting spaces between the letters, I thought I was following the way everyone else does it here.", "I think you're saying he's not the ah, but your judgement letters say he is.", "NTA.\n\nHe's so insecure and jealous that you don't wanna share your good news, in case he gets mad or upset. Is this the person you wanna be with? A good, loving partner celebrates their partner's successes, and doesn't throw a tantrum because he is too lazy and incapable of improving their own life.\n\nWhat are you actually getting out of this relationship? Because it's not love, it's not support. You deserve so much better.", "NTA - to him        \nBUT you are the AH to yourself.          \nIt\u2019s NOT understandable to resent someone who has their dream job.        \nIf anyone I cared about got their dream job I\u2019d be stoked for them.        \nI always wanted to be a lawyer but due to things I couldn\u2019t go to uni.        \nI found out 2 yrs ago that my nephew is going to law school.      \nI am so happy for him I tell anyone who will listen.        \nIf you love someone you are happy when they have their dreams.       \nYou having your dream job doesn\u2019t affect or hurt him.       \nYou shouldn\u2019t have to hide it.", "OP this dude is a walking red flag. If he had ANY \"advantage\" of you in terms of $$$ or status etc he would be using it to be WAY more negative and controlling of you and your achievements. IT WILL NOT GET BETTER when they are like this."]}
