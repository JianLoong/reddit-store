The vast majority of them might experience some irritability or trouble sleeping for a few days to a week when they stop, even abruptly after chronic high usage. Vomiting and such seems rather extreme and pretty unusual. It's also odd to me that edibles and vape pens are insufficient for a THC replacement. They are much more concentrated than weed, so that doesn't make much sense to me - maybe his symptoms are psychosomatic, or his anxiety needs significant medical intervention.

It\u2019s well and good to want to support him in getting treatment, but you also have to decide your breaking point and be prepared to walk away as hard as that is.
