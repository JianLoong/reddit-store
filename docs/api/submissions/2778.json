The vast majority of them might experience some irritability or trouble sleeping for a few days to a week when they stop, even abruptly after chronic high usage. Vomiting and such seems rather extreme and pretty unusual. It's also odd to me that edibles and vape pens are insufficient for a THC replacement. They are much more concentrated than weed, so that doesn't make much sense to me - maybe his symptoms are psychosomatic, or his anxiety needs significant medical intervention.

How does that impact you? Is this the life you want to life and continue living? These are only answers you can gain from asking yourself these questions.

Secondly- What it ACTUALLY sounds like is he has a physical disability or chronic illness. My partner, ironically, has POTS. The only medication we have access to for him is, well, weed. If he doesn't smoke flower, he gets shakey, passes out, has seizures, many other things. It seems maybe instead of coming from a place of judgement you should get him to a doctor. THIRDLY AND MOST IMPORTANT TO NOTE: YOU CANNOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE A PHYSICAL DEPENDENCY OR ADDICTION TO MARIJUANA. It is LITERALLY not possible. He may have an emotional/mental dependency BUT THAT IS NOT ADDICTION. Some people in this comment section clearly have never been around REAL addiction. \nI've turned down jobs because I knew that an environment where I needed to be tested was not viable with my life style and therefore would cost me more in the long run. \nStrong YTA for not actually doing any research and understanding this doesn't happen BECAUSE of the weed itself. And all you judgemental assholes in the comments are too for speaking on something you clearly know NOTHING about."]}
