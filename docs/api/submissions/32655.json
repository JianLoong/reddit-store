To say I\u2019m stretched thin is an understatement. Every spare moment I have is dedicated to quality time with my kids \u2013 playing games, reading, visiting the park, or simply enjoying moments of relaxation together. I want to emphasize this so it's clear I'm dedicated to my children despite my tight schedule. I love them and wish I had more time for them.\n\nHowever, the holiday season brought a new suggestion from my husband, who is on a 6 month sabbatical (42m) and mother-in-law, who is retired (64) - Elf on the Shelf. At first, I loved the idea, I didn\u2019t do it as a child of course and it also seemed cute, but I quickly realized that committing to this tradition meant adding yet another task to my already overloaded plate. The idea  of writing letters and creatively hiding an elf every night seemed fun but impractical given my limited free time.\n\nBoth my husband and mother-in-law decided to take charge of this Elf on the Shelf adventure. On December 1st, my mother-in-law read the kids a fun story about the elf and made a grand spectacle of finding it. It was adorable, and the children were ecstatic. \n\nBy day two, my mother-in-law expressed that she was tired and unable to come by every night to write letters and move the elf. She suggested that I take over. I firmly declined. This annoyed both her and my husband. On nights three and four, my husband reluctantly stepped in, already grumbling about the added responsibility. When he hinted at needing help, I stood my ground, refusing to budge.\n\nBy night five, the pressure mounted. My husband and mother-in-law confronted me, accusing me of laziness and essentially ruining Christmas for our kids. I reiterated my initial stance, emphasizing that I never wanted to undertake this Elf on the Shelf endeavor in the first place. I made it clear that if they ceased their efforts, I wouldn't continue it either. Days six and seven passed with the elf staying put, resulting in disappointed children and and an angry husband and mother-in-law.\n\nReluctantly, my husband resumed the Elf on the Shelf routine, but he still views me as unreasonable and uncooperative. He called be a bad mother, lazy, and an asshole. He\u2019s also refusing to talk to me. I can't help but wonder if I've been immature, it takes less than 15 minutes a day to write a letter and creatively hide the else . But deep down, I still feel that adding this tradition is an unnecessary burden on my  life.

They bought this thinking you would cave in and take over. How are you lazy for not wanting to do it, but he isn't?  Stand your ground and force your husband to keep it up. This was his decision. Now, he needs to deal with the consequences.", "NTA there is a special place in hell fir the person who invented Elf on the Shelf...", "NTA.  It's a creepy tradition anyway.  The whole idea of someone watching over your shoulder every second is just too much big brother for me.", "NTA And all I do is move mine. Forget that other fancy shit.", "NTA, but your husband is. WTF? Fuck him and your MIL for bringing this monstrosity into your house and expecting you to deal with it. Their choice, their responsibility.", "NTA- the husband is lazy for trying to get you to do something he decided was needed.", "NTA Why is your husband incapable of moving a small doll without your help?", "NTA- You were not interested when they started it. Your husband and MIL are too busy to do it. Why does that magically mean you have the time to do it. \n\nIf this doesn\u2019t add to your massive schedule, do a little research on how other parents do a low-stakes version. Maybe the elf was playing with glue and got his leg accidentally glued to something.  Maybe he fell and broke his leg? I\u2019ve seen a few where the elf got stuck to something with tape and can\u2019t get out. They can\u2019t move, but they can still watch for Santa.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband is also a parent. He\u2019s the parent who suggested the elf. He\u2019s not even working currently- he has more than enough time to do it if he truly wants the kids to experience it.", "NTA. it\u2019s not 15 minutes, it\u2019s 15 minutes every day for a month, every single year until you die. It\u2019s the mental load of having to come up with new ideas and the drudgery of having yet another task to do when you\u2019re already tired and over it. You knew that, which is why you said no. They also knew that but assumed you\u2019d just take over once they started. \n\nDon\u2019t let them gaslight you into thinking this is on you. It\u2019s not. I would sit them both down and tell them that they started this shit so it\u2019s on them to see it through. Then on Christmas Day set the stupid elf on fire and tell your husband in no uncertain terms that if elf on the shelf is ever mentioned again, you will file for divorce and demand a 50/50 custody split. \n\nFuck. That. Shit.", "NTA. Your husband is the one who really wants the kids to have this particular experience, so he should be in charge of getting it done.

How in the world is the Elf your responsibility?\n\nI am guessing here, but does hubby cook and clean? Does he shuttle kids to appointments? Does he plan events, such as birthday and Holiday plans?

However, you can make it less time-consuming.\n\nI cannot stress the importance of this point enough:\n\n**Your Elf should NEVER move on a designated schedule, such as every night.**\n\nInstead, your Elf should choose to move randomly (stay in one place a few days, other times move several times a day.) And your Elf can move without doing elaborate things. Only occasionally does he need to do something extra funny. He can also pose in funny ways that just take seconds to accomplish.\n\nTake my advice, and you will have a nice compromise.", "Other than giving you more work/projects to do, what does your husband contribute to the relationship (besides children)? \nNTA.
