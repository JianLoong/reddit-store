Poor elf had been shoved in her underwear drawer for 5 days and counting \ud83d\ude05", "I absolutely despise the tradition and think it shouldn't be done. This is all my opinion granted. I love the idea of Santa and the magic the season brings, but this idea that a toy \"watches\" your kids and if they f up even slightly = possibility of no gifts. Nope. Not down for that. Kids are kids. We need to parent when they step out of line and not allow an imaginary thing to do the parenting for us. \n\nSo no NTA and stay firm in your stance. Honestly the one who is on a 6 month sabbatical can do it. MIL can if she is able, but they aren't her children.", "NTA... I'm proud of you for standing your ground.

Next, explain that a sabbatical is the same as a vacation, which he is on...and you are not. Now suggest that since you have a full-time job, ALL childcare will be split when you get home, but while you're at work, he will be expected to do the laundry, cleaning, shopping, cooking, ferry the children to where they need to be and be solely responsible for scheduling and keeping doctor's appointments, school events...and place the blankety-blank Elf where it needs to be.\n\nYou're NTA, and if it were me, I'd ship useless husband back to the woman who thinks I'm lazy for working full time,producing and raising five children AND going for an advanced degree.", "NTA. Sorry but fuck that. You have 5 kids under 7 and are doing a PHD, and they expect you to do elf on the shelf. It's such a bogus optional extra.

If anything your MIL is the AH for starting something she can't finish.", "All I got to say is who gets a six month sabbatical? An Arab?", "NTA.  If it only takes 15 minutes a day to write a letter and move the elf, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem for your husband\u2026who is on a freaking sabbatical.

But he and his mother tried to trap you into this tradition and he\u2019s now sulky because you didn\u2019t fall into line.  So, no, you\u2019re are definitely NTA for standing your ground on this.  But your husband and MIL definitely are for trying to bulldoze you into doing something that only added to your burdens.", "[removed]", "NTA.

The standard in your house is that they have \"great ideas\" and YOU do the legwork. \n\nBut the reality is that your husband is not only the lazy and feckless one, he's also not really a nice person. \n\nFor a middle-aged man who is literally on sabbatical - a time meant to be a BREAK from his job usually taken to invest in more personal pursuits, from academic research to personal projects to . . . well, family time - he has some extraordinary audacity to look at a wife who is juggling HIS unusually large passel of very young children, a full-time job which supports HIS family financially, AND a Ph.D. program (which implies that you are both hardworking and quite a catch, intellectually, and he should be counting his blessings) and call you \"lazy\" in any context. \n\nHonestly, the things he said to you aren't just obnoxious (though they are that), they're **shockingly hateful**. They show a tremendous ingratitude for the genuinely extraordinary amount of work you put into the family that the two of you share, and a willingness to easily dismiss all that you do over the slightest inconvenience to him. He sounds like a massive AH who owes you a HUGE apology. \n\nOf course you're NTA. But more than that, I think your husband needs a serious talk about taking you for granted.", "We need to figure out some kind of language for you to use to Teflon this weird expectation off of yourself. B/c the family's current language is extremely messed up: he gets to call you \"lazy\" when you're stretched thin and HE'S ON SABBATICAL? You haven't mentioned how TF he spends his time, and yeah maybe he's writing a book or whatever, but no, he doesn't get to act like *you*'re the lazy one while his time is way more open than yours and still he gripes about doing something that was his idea.\n\nIn my family we're pretty strict about who owns what work and especially that if you had a cool idea and decided to do it, you own all the work of that idea. If you want someone to help you with it, you have to get their buy-in at the beginning, present the project to them and get an agreement about how much they're willing to do. You don't just rush into something half-cocked and then decide others are selfish for not picking up your slack.\n\nMaybe a first step would be to call this \"your Elf-on-the-Shelf\" when talking to your husband or MIL. Most definitely in front of the kids as well as alone. Call it that every time. The secret is, **don't do it with angry emphasis**. You're not picking a fight, you're changing the narrative. It's not getting them to admit that it's their thing that counts, it's saying so a zillion times till everyone just kind of instinctively knows it's their thing. So you say it very casually as if it's a thing no-one could question. & if the topic comes up beyond that, your narrative and wording is basically this: \"Yeah it's too bad I wasn't able to help with your Elf-on-the-Shelf, it was a cool idea though and it's neat that you're doing it.\" Him: \"But you should help! You're being lazy!\" You: \"Hon, you know I'm just not able with everything else I'm doing. Is it becoming too much for you? I know it can be hard to follow through on things you've decided sometimes, but I believe in you.\" \"You should be doing it!\" \"It's yours, dear, it's your decision what to do about it. I think you'll make the right choice.\"\n\n I don't know, not everyone can do this necessarily, but see how the \"you\" voice declines to get mad/negative or respond to his accusations but also declines to take the least bit of ownership over the Elf? Accusations of laziness are meant to shift the argument, to cause you to start defending yourself with lists of everything you do, and the main purpose of that is to deflect attention from the simple fact that he undertook a project and is now trying to fob it off on you. It's meant to shift the ground of the argument onto \"are you a good mom\" rather than \"do you have to do what he says b/c he doesn't feel like doing it.\" (BTW other ground-shifting argument to beware of: \"it's so selfish of you to call it my Elf! It's the family's/children's Elf!\" The answer is \"Oh, honey, I just mean who's in charge of it. I guess it's you & MIL's really, you had the idea together.\") Remember where the real ground of the argument is: it's HIS elf. Every time you say that in any form (especially in a calm casual way that assumes everyone knows it's true!), THAT is a victory. And enough of those small victories can change the entire family narrative. And when it's changed you won't feel this pressure. If your husband tries one of his moves one of the kids will immediately say, \"*Dad!* It's *your* Elf!\"\n\nNext stop: *his* Halloween light show.", "Do not do it.\n\nAny project they start is theirs from now on.", "I just don't understand it.

I think killing as such wasn't punished as a whole . the ten commandments gave some rules how ppl suppose to live together as a society . we don't need them now  but it worked in the past causing fear of being punished in hell when ppl died young .

So when somebody accedentily broke your leg you would also break his leg. I mean it sounds fair and morally right . your son pushed a kid into the water it's morally fair to push your son into water . Society thought it was morally right to get ride of hysteric women they were a thread to society a thread to their husband . what you think is morally today will be seen as morally wrong in the future slaughtering animals with no regard of their well being is seen as morally alright by meat eaters .  My point is that society decides what's morally correct not one person . you grow up with morals by following society guideline .
