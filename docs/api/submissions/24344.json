I have a folder where I keep my yearly budget tracker, my monthly budget tracker, and an emergency calendar that I print off in case I forget my calendar.

I find money a taboo subject, and I wouldn't say I like talking about it to anyone. Many friends and family ask me financial questions; some ask out of genuine concern to see if I'm struggling, but I also feel some ask out of noisiness.

Because we had last Saturday off work, my sister arranged to come round with my nephew so we could all see each other. My sister needed to print of an important email so I allowed her to use my office to print stuff off. Whilst she was doing that I was watching my nephew. She came down and she was upset and angry; she told me she found my folder and she knows how much I earn monthly and yearly. \n\nI didn't know when to add this is but my sister thought that I only earned about \u00a33,000.00 more than her; I didn't correct her as I don't like talking about my finances. My sister was shocked to find out that I earn 4x more than she does each year and she was pissed with me big time. She said the only thing I've been doing to her is lie about how much I earn and that I could have helped her out during her time of need. I don't like lending money to anyone.

I think that you are wise to be hesitant to loan people money. I\u2019ve loaned money to family members & in one instance it damaged our relationship.

You do not owe her support just because you make more money than her. If she wants money she can get a better paying job. Tell her it is none of her business and what you earn belongs to you.

My son has it as a co-morbidity with his ASD diagnosis and it's a co-ordination deficit. Like, it makes people clumsy/unco-ordinated in their movements. \n\nI don't see how that follows through to you needing to have a meticulously kept folder of all your financial information/budgeting. There's no reason for you not to have that, and there's nothing wrong with wanting to have that, it's just a strange thing to pin on dyspraxia.", "INFO:\n\nWhen finances come up do you let people believe you are struggling or on a lower income? When close family are struggling and you could easily help out, do you not offer to help out?\n\nBased on your lifestyle people may think you are less well-off/poorer than you seem and they may feel they need to help you.\n\nIf someone close to you is financially struggling due to no/limited fault of their own, I think it would be an AH thing to let them suffer if you could easily help them out (through a loan or a gift or whatever). If I was making 4 times what my sibling was making and they are struggling to pay rent or buy food for their kids because of some taxes they owed and didn't know about or a car accident they were in that wasn't their fault, I wouldn't mind sending them anywhere from \u00a31-5k depending on what the money was going to be used for and whether we are talking about a gift or some kind of loan. But it's ok if you don't want to help family and close friends in their time of need if you could easily do so. However, don't expect any kind of help when the shoe is on the other foot (whether you would need financial help or someone to care for you when you recover from surgery, etc).", "ESH. She snooped and that's not cool. She also feels entitled to your money which is pretty telling.\n\nBut this false modesty crap rich people do is so cringe, man. I see far too many people making a lot of money demanding everyone around them pretend they're all normal and middle class because they get way too offended whenever someone clocks them as wealthy. Don't be like that with everyone in your life, it's cringe.\n\nJust tell your sister you didn't tell *her* because she obviously is a big snoop that, as she admits, would come to you for a handout whenever she needed one. Keeping those sorts of facts from people that are bad with money is self protection, but being weird and overly concerned about finances with *everyone* is just really cliche and cringe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Change your passwords on your accounts and emails.   \n\nShe is not entitled to either know about your finances or receive any part of your income.  Her financial decisions are not your problem, OP.", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't lie. And you don't owe anyone that information. The real reason she is angry is that she feels like she missed out on all the money she could have scammed from you if she knew you had it. She went through your personal belongings to find that info. She is not trustworthy and I wouldn't allow her in your house again.", "NTA. Your finances are private, you can share what you\u2019re comfortable with. If you\u2019re not comfortable, you don\u2019t need to share.

Her reaction alone tells you it's none of her business", "Your sister shouldn't have snooped. Especially when you were doing her a favor.\n\n(They're drawers. Draw is a verb, drawer is a noun.)", "In what way did OP's dyspraxia add context to this story?", "NTA\nYour job and financial situation is your own business. You stated that you do not like talking about money, and you don\u2019t like to lead money.\nYou sister probably had an idea about that, because why was she snooping? Not hard to open a browser, open an email, click print \u2026. Log out", ">I could have helped her out during her time of need\n\nNTA There it is.

Never loan or give her money.", "NTA  Your entitled brat of a sister is probably upset you weren't taking her out for expensive dinners and handing her wads of cash.  She's mad she didn't know she could try and exploit you .", "Op: {living\u2019 life}\nsister:  How dare you have money you let me have?", "NTA.

It's none of your sister's business how much you make. Did you ask her money? No. But she wants to hit you up. Always interesting how people decide how others should spend their money. \"You make more than me so you should spend it as I dictate!\". \n\n\"No\" is a complete sentence. You can expand.  \"No, this isn't any of your business.\" \"No. I won't give you money.\" \"No, I don't owe you an explanation. \" \"No, you can't use my stuff again because you can't be trusted to not snoop.\"", "NTA she is for snooping", "Also if my sister was earning more than me I would be happy.

By asking about your finances. This is really disrespectful\n2. By then speculating on your finances\n3. By snooping in your private records. This is particularly egregious because she did this by taking advantage of your favour in letting her use your office. I strongly recommend you do not allow her this kindness again\n4. By getting angry at you! The one and only person entitled to anger here is you! You are the one she has repeatedly wronged - you have done nothing - absolutely and utterly nothing - wrong!\n5. Taking for granted that your income means you are obligated to act as her presumably interest-free bank! You are not!\n\nYour finances do not obligate you to her in any way, shape and form!\n\nHer finances do not obligate you either!\n\nShe owes you apologies galore for these disrespectful outrages!", "NTA for keeping your income or any other personal information private. Your sister certainly is the A H for snooping and for thinking she's entitled to get money from you when she has chosen a low paying job. Do not \"help her out\"; she will never repay you.", "NTA. I feel like your sister proved your point. You aren't obligated to help someone simply because you earn more. Maybe she could budget better?!", "So your sister snooped through your private belongings and now she's mad because she found out that she could have been exploiting you for money the whole time? It might be time to go low contact with her until she gets a reality check! You don't owe her anything! Her hard times are hers to deal with and knowing you have more money shouldn't be making her feel entitled to it and she's actually mad that she didn't know to ask for it! You are NTA", "NTA.  She shouldn\u2019t have been snooping.  Change your passwords and info.  She shouldn\u2019t be mad that you make decent money.  She isn\u2019t entitled to any of yours.

Certainly not hers.  \n\nPlease don\u2019t let her pressure you into loaning or giving her money.", "Oof. OP, you let people make a lot of assumptions.  I get it, but you have to just start setting boundaries and saying no. \n\nThat being said, this isn't over. Your sister and whole family will know how much you make.

In my case it was multiple family members.\n\nI have schizoaffective disorder, PTSD and borderline ASD and they took advantage of all of that. So I went no contact with them.\n\nI am not saying that is what you should do, but I do suggest talking to your sister if you can and letting her know how far out of line she is.\n\nIf that does not work, minimising contact with her may become necessary.\n\nBe prepared for an onslaught of demands for money from her. She seems to have a sick and twisted sense of entitlement to your money.\n\nIf that happens, you may need to go no contact with her.\n\nI am so sorry this is happening to you.", "I read the whole thing. I\u2019m aware of the story and condition. It just has no bearing on whether she is TA or not.", "Because it clarified that she has a disorder that impacts upon her clarity of thought and I think that highly relevant.\n\nFor one, I do ponder how much of this is related to disability exploitation on the OP's sister's part.", "NTA but you seem like the kind of person I wouldn\u2019t want in my life.
