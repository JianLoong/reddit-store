Or you can attach a small lockbox to the back of the house somewhere (maybe the back door if there is one), and it just requires a simple code to get in and grab the spare key (of course, you have to remember to put it back after). This way, no one needs to get so damn mad when they forget their key and no one\u2019s around to let them in. They can also take some responsibility for letting themselves in their own house, and not hold anyone else accountable for their own mistake.", "NTA You know your \"friend\" won't buy you all new stuff when it gets stolen, right?", "NTA. I would\u2019ve made her wait 2 DAYS.", "AirTags are really good at reminding you if you\u2019ve forgotten your keys. \n\nNTA, your roommates are unprepared idiots.", "NTA. She needs to learn how to be an adult.", "People need to start locking their doors and their cars. NTA", "NTA- her refusing to have another Roomate unlock the door is beyond ridiculous. She is the one who didn\u2019t have a key, how is that your fault? I would be pissed with her if I were your other roommates as well.", "The roommate\u2019s bratty behavior makes her the AH of course, but I am curious, was your party next door or very nearby? Then maybe I could see you possibly being the AH.  If it was a decent distance away, like across campus, and would take a significant amount of time to return, there shouldn\u2019t be any expectation of you returning home just for her.", "\"You don't want to be my friend? That sucks...but this should STILL be a lesson for you to behave like an ADULT and remember your key in case this situation happens again.\" NTA", "NTA she needs to grow the fuck up. For whatever reason that room mate sees you as the one who will take the fall. I had a room mate like this. Luckily each of the times I did not own the common items that caused the curfluffles. I would not engage with your room mate. Simply state we have keys. We lock the door to be safe. Use the keys. Maybe watch some true crime when they are in the background about people entering college housing. There's plenty.", "Your roommate sounds both mature and reasonable, you\u2019re very lucky", "NTA - and you really want a \"friend\" who expects you to risk everything you own coz she can't be arsed to behave like an adult & remember basics (such as keys to get back in)?\n\nSeriously, you're young. Keep studying and get involved in activities that interest you. You will meet other young people along the way who will be genuine friends to *you*. A self-centred user like that is going to cause grief for you along the way even if you crawled back to her on this & gave her the apology that she categorically isn't entitled to. She isn't a friend anyway. No matter how much you abase yourself, she'll simply treat you badly and blame you for any difficult circumstances she encounters. Somehow she'll manage to make it *your* fault.", "How the fuck is her forgetting her keys your fuck up?  How are people this goddamn stupid", "NTA\n\nI bet she\u2019d feel differently if she came home to find the flat trashed and/or robbed or with an intruder inside. You can\u2019t just not live your life on the off chance she doesn\u2019t have her keys. Next time she gives you shit, ask her if she wants you to explain the situation to others from your perspective. She\u2019s upset because she was locked out for two hours. She\u2019s decided to blame you for the fact she didn\u2019t bother taking her keys and assuming you\u2019d be in rather than communicate and ask if you\u2019d be home. She\u2019s angry that you were responsible and locked the door behind you when you left. She\u2019s angry that you didn\u2019t drop what you were doing to come home. She chose to be difficult and be locked out for longer out of\u2026 spite? sounds ridiculous because it is.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell her to either get a key, or to get used to waiting outside. And stop answering her calls or texts when you are out.", "I would get on her ass anytime she leaves the house without locking the door.. she sounds very tiring to deal with", "I\u2019d be extremely unhappy if I lived there and came home to find the door unlocked.  I\u2019d be worried that there could be some home invader hiding with duct tape and a knife in the house.\n\nYour housemate is stupid.  NTA", "And they \u201cforget\u201d (which I read as don\u2019t care to) lock the door at night, when most burglaries occur.  Honestly OP\u2019s probably better off finding new roommates who take safety seriously.", "I keep a spare in my wallet\n\nThis stems from when I used to go shopping in 90 degree F heat and left the keys in the car with the engine and AC running, to cool the doggoes\n\nOne day, one of the adorable little bastards pushed down the door lock, while looking for me out the window...", "I can't imagine living in a place where people are so comfortable to leave the front doors unlocked. It must be really rural or small town.\n\nI live in a share house. The front door is has a screen door and a wooden door (both of which are locked) and our bedrooms have a door too.", "I agree with your sentiment, but OP still has to live with her, at least for a while.", "This 100%, the entitlement is insane. SHE should be apologizing. You do not need friends like this.", "I do! Stupid brat. \n\nNTA", "Bring up Moscow Idaho and how the idiot roommates didn't do shit. (Only kind of blaming them, I was also an idiot at their age but I handled finding a corpse better than they did back when I was 12.

Like, overly common. But I've def used a variation at my job several times.", "You must be new, or young. I'm *sure* it happened. \n\nPosts like this are pretty common. One woman was pissed because she refused to look for and *use* her house key. OP was supposed to be at her beck and call.\n\nI've used that line on my neighbor plenty of times when she's run over, frantic about how she *needs* to use our vehicle, for whatever reason. Last time, she kept the truck for 6 hours and brought it back empty. Don't ever ask again.", "Wait, I'm confused. why does OP suck? She brought her keys with her and locked the door.", "Yes because that\u2019s a regular occurrence \ud83d\ude44 there\u2019s probably a bigger chance to get struck by lightning; don\u2019t fear monger", "It is probably quite unlikely that you'd get murdered (or even attacked by a surprised robber), but it is totally insane that the roommates are okay with just not locking the door. It is one thing to not lock the deadbolt when you're home, but simply not locking the door at all when the house is empty is very strange.\n\nYou can plan around an emergency situation where there temporarily are not enough keys, but just always leaving the door unlocked regardless of safety isn't reasonable.", "You weren't worried that someone would drive off with you car and doggos?", "More insane behavior. Who the hell leaves a car running, unlocked and with their dogs in it?!", "I once lived in a neighborhood where nobody ever locked their doors. Except for us. \n\nJust like I used to go camping in Girl Scouts until my parents found out we didn't secure the food where bears wouldn't feel the need to raid our tents. \n\nBut my parents lived *really* rural before I was conceived and they decided to move closer to medical care and running water.

Why help out opportunistic criminals by not locking the door?", "You can't be serious. I'm on my phone and don't have a ton of time to do any thorough searching, but a very quick google search tells me that on average, about 28 americans die to lightning a year. 28. You really think less than 28 people a year have breakins or home invasions? I'll tell you that from my cursory googling, that there are about 580,000 home burglaries a year in the US. Of those, the victim is home in about 160,000 of them and an actual assault takes place in about 40,000 of them. But no, there's probably a bigger chance to experience the thing they literally use as an example of things that are unlikely to happen. Come on, man, don't be stupid.", "I prefer locking doors when out because of the risk of burglary, but many college-age young adults (presumably this is in the US; university students elsewhere) are new to adulting, and as the saying goes, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.

They left their door unlocked and someone just went in and assaulted them.\n\n5 in 4 years doesn't sound a lot when you consider how many students there were, bu id rather my kid take 2 seconds to lock their door than have life long trauma even if its a 1 in 10000 chance of happening.", "I mean, maybe, but you still don't go out on a mountain top in a thunderstorm shouting that Zeus is a pathetic idiot do you...", "Leaving your door unlocked exponentially increases the chance of being involved in a home invasion.

Why fucking do it when it takes basically no effort to NOT hold the lightning rod.", "you must not be from the US, AKA the murder capitol of the universe", "I agree with everything you said.. except for that bit at the end. Don't be name calling, you already provided them with the information that was lacking. Leave that shit in 3rd grade where it's supposed to be..", "This sort of thing is absolutely exaggerated. But the reason it's almost a joke is because it's rooted in reality", "I\u2019m Dutch, our back door is only locked when the whole family is gone for the whole day together or when we are on vacation. We forgot to lock a second door on our patio one time and only found out after about 6 weeks\u2026 So yes, I might underestimate the level of crime in the US\u2026."]}
