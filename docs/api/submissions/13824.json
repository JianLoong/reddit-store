This means that if she wants to sleep at 9 pm, husband and I basically have to retire to our bedroom at 9 pm as well. It means not being able to decompress in my own living room.

Over dinner, I find myself grossed out every night hearing her ill-fitted denture move around in her mouth when she eats, rarely finishing my plate when she eats with us. Several times my husband has called me an AH for being aloof with her.\n\nEver since having children, I have found that she\u2019ll undermine my rules regarding e.g. sweets (which she\u2019ll slip to him when I\u2019m not around), screen time, and safety-related issues. For example, she\u2019ll do the dishes (despite us telling her to stop doing that and just use the dishwasher) and put knives and glassware to dry on a towel on the counter, with the towel hanging off the edge of the counter, so that my toddler could pull on it and have knives and glassware fall onto him. I\u2019ve confronted her several times, and she keeps saying she forgets.

If it's a problem tell her hotels are an option too.\n\nHubby should be handlng his mother and not allow her entitled behaviour. If he won't then you need to.

You married your husband, therefore you *also* married his mom.  Sorry, but that is the reality for many families.  Just as you should tolerate and try to respect her, in many places that is a 2 way street.\n\nIt is *his* mother and so he can talk to her.  You've just had another child and you are super busy (and prolly super, super tired).  You're choosing not to stop your whole day to talk to MIL is perfectly understandable; I'm from the US so, take that into account regarding my opinion.\n\nMy MIL made me miserable often, then she died.  Okay, it sounds very, very terrible, but my life improved x100 after she stopped walking the earth.  Also, your worry about knives on a towel on counter is very **very valid**.  \n\nI got lucky, my daughter was 3 and started pulling things off kitchen counters - headache! Then one day there was a small pot of cold water on the counter during a very cold, winter day.  I saw her start to reach for the pot, but I said nothing.  She pulled the pot down, soaked her clothes and banged her head slightly.  Lots of tears, wah wah, warm bath, dry clothes; it was a couple of hours before I got her completely calmed down.  Guess what?  She never did it again.  I could not have set it up on purpose and have it work - I was sleep deprived and well, running on empty when she was 3. \n\nI suppose the 3 yo story isn't helpful.  It's not like you can pour cold water over your MIL.  I guess I shared that bc motherhood is hard enough without MIL's criticism and second-guessing everything.", "NTA\n\nCute of your husband to act like this is all your fault. Is he not aware that advocating for you and setting some boundaries with his mom (kindly but firmly) would mean you actually would have the capacity to be more pleasant with her?", "NTA, but this situation isn't tenable. You can't spend a quarter of the year with an ill-mannered houseguest sleeping in your living room. Your husband needs to stop being a doormat for your MIL and tell her that you can't host her for months on end.", "NTA\n\nJust want to point out that you say \"she's a nice enough lady\" when she clearly isn't", "Yes but mil needs to respect her dil too. Plus everyone gets a baseline of respect and more is earned. \n\nPlus it doesn\u2019t sound like their home is suited for long visits if mil is sleeping in living room due to the bathroom. \n\nThree months of someone in your living room is a hardship. This isnt a short trip.", "This isn\u2019t about the elderly. The woman is of sound mind and body here. The issue is that she feels entitled to be a rude and entitled guest by OP\u2019s cultural standards. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t OPs husband respect her culture too? OP already has this person in her home for a quarter of the YEAR. She\u2019s compromised. Where is he compromising? He\u2019s leaving all difficult conversations to OP including the safety of their kids. \n\nNot a hardship? Have you never been in a DIL/MIL dynamic where the MIL\u2019s every comment and act is making a disparaging point about the DIL? Did you not read the post?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou are fine not to answer her calls and texts. YOur husband is the Ah, let HIm talk to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs he talking to YOUR mom as much as he wants you to talk to his mom?", "NTA. Your husband needs to stand up for you. My MIL used to call me nearly daily to ask about the baby and I stopped picking up so she\u2019ll harass HER son at work instead, so DH knew how crazy she got. Selective hearing has saved my sanity. Tell DH you\u2019ll pick up her calls only if she stops staying 3 months a year. Maybe 3 days.\n\nAlso anyone undermining parents\u2019 childcare rules = out. No slipping the child candy or putting child at risk.", "Op. It\u2019s annoying. You\u2019re NTA. Put a reverse UNO card. Have your mom stay with you and let your husband put up with it.", "I think mostly NAH. Seems like a cultural mismatch. Your obviously NTA. Some cultures put parents and elder on a far higher pedestal. I don\u2019t really think they are an asshole ether for that. Your going to need to have some harder conversations though. Having her sleep in the living room seems like it won\u2019t work. Explaining that you will be making noise early before work and not being apologetic is crucial.", "Yup you\u2019re right. My husband and I usually don\u2019t fight, but when his mother is here, things do get tense and conflictual, particularly when I start biting back on comments (she\u2019ll be shocked pikachu) or when I put my foot down on screen time and safety issues. It is during those moments when my MIL will outright say she\u2019s just as much a member of this household, which I know my husband agrees with. One time she was complaining about me to one of her friends, who lives here in the states, in front of me, and her friend said to her: no, just like you\u2019ve had your run with your kids, she gets to do things her way with her kids and set her rules. MIL was taken aback. It helped for a while. Getting back-up from my husband would be a game-changer, but I just don\u2019t see it happening in the near future.", "Thank you. \u201cRunning on empty\u201d is exactly how I\u2019m feeling right now.", "To give him credit, he does genuinely love spending time with my parents, and he has a good relationship with them.", "I\u2019m fine meeting her halfway, but placating her in my own home at the expense of my toddler\u2019s safety goes way too far. I\u2019m thinking if she keeps \u201cforgetting\u201d I might have to lock the knives away from her, the way I would from a child.", "I bet that\u2019s because your folks are way nicer.", "And how often does he have longer phone conversations with them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd; your parents are better persons than MIL?", "NTA but your husband sure is. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever allow my MIL to stay for that long if I can\u2019t stand her. You need to put your foot down and stop letting her visit. Or if she does, she needs to stay for a lot less.", "NTA. You have a husband problem. Is there anyone in your life who\u2019d be willing to treat him the way your MIL treats you, just so he can get a taste of that \u201cwell-meaning advice\u201d medicine?", "NTA honey!!! Respect has to be earned. She has not done so by not respecting your rules where  your child is concerned! \n\nEver thought of asking your mom to come and visit for a nice long stay?? Maybe she can offer some \"helpful\" advice to your husband on how to raise children and how not to treat her daughter!!....just saying! You know...put the shoe on the other foot so to speak!", "I slipped up and gave (unasked for) advice for the first time ever yesterday. I then apologised  - because I have no intention of being interfering like my late MiL.\n\nSiL laughed and said he appreciated my concern but assured me he'd have no problem telling me where to get off if needed. Thank goodness!", "You should see a couples counselor together to discuss this.\n\nI don't know how you tolerate having your MIL over. You have a husband problem, but she exacerbates it, no doubt.", "NTA, OP!  My piece of unsolicited advice is to start with the bedroom. Not having her intrude that much into your own space and privacy would be a big first step - and there is absolutely no reason for her to do this unless she is disabled and has trouble with stairs. Her convenience should not trump your personal space; do not allow her to set up her bed on your couch. \n\nThe next step is her declaring herself a member of your household - which she is not. Use your words (frequently...) to remind her that she is a guest.  Get your husband to reinforce that small but important boundary, from which all other entitled behaviours flow.\n\nHave you chatted with your BIL/SIL, if you are at all close to them? Do they have any tips on MIL management?", "If her excuse about the knives is that they last longer hand washed then she needs to understand that they must be hand dried and put away. You can\u2019t leave knives on a damp towel without causing some level of damage. Same with glassware. She needs to dry it and put it away. Or maybe hub can bond for a few minutes and do the drying. My kids were climbers so you couldn\u2019t leave anything out. One of my managers went through this with her in-laws which drove her crazy. She would stay at work to avoid having dinner with them and they would be sitting there, doing nothing except waiting for her to cook them dinner. It\u2019s probably customary in your husband\u2019s culture but I\u2019m sure DILs everywhere would appreciate that that particular custom go out of style. Once again, I thank god I have no in-laws."]}
