I paused my jog and ran over to ask if I could say hello, and they said of course, the puppy wouldn\u2019t have allowed me not to lol\n\nI love dogs, so I was in heaven. I spent several minutes on the ground with her getting all kinds of love and affection and asking her owners her name, how old, etc. She also happened to be the same breed as the dog I grew up with who passed away a few weeks ago, a golden retriever who was my best friend, so this was especially comforting for me.\n\nA few minutes into talking (to clarify: about two minutes, and I was probably with them for about 4 total: 2 with the dog, 2 the wife being mad and the husband getting her to leave), I noticed the wife starting to look irritated. At first, I figured I might\u2019ve overstayed my welcome, so I decided to back off. I got up and said something like \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to your walk now, but thank you so much, that was the highlight of my day!\u201d\n\nAs the husband was saying goodbye to me, the wife interrupts him and goes \u201cReally?\u201d I was pretty confused, so I asked her if something was wrong. See, the couple also had a baby with them, a little girl sleeping in a stroller. I\u2019m bad with ages, but if I had to guess she was probably around a month-ish old. The wife said I was \u201cbeyond rude\u201d for spending all this time \u201ccooing over the damn dog\u201d but not saying anything about her newborn.\n\nI have absolutely nothing against babies or children in the slightest, including this woman\u2019s daughter. I see them as other human beings just like me. But I won\u2019t lie\u2014babies and kids have never elicited the same\u2026 instant warm feelings? that dogs and all animals do for me. This is to say, I\u2019ve never really been the type to coo at babies. I don\u2019t hate or dislike them at all, I just regard them in the same way I regard all strangers regardless of age.\n\nAnyway, before I could get a word in, the husband began ushering her away and told me to have a good day, though I could still hear her muttering things about me under her breath as they left. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude, but I\u2019m wondering now if I actually was.

It's the dog that interested you, so why would you say anything about the baby? You're obviously not going to be able to pet and play with a stranger's baby. Also disturbing that the wife made it clear she doesn't like the dog. Maybe it's a sore point between the couple and you unknowingly touched a nerve.

You could have gushed about the baby and called T A for not petting the dog.", "Lol, NTA. I have to make sure I say hi to the pet owner before departing so I\u2019m not completely disregarding them.

I'm so glad to see all of these people who are just like me and don't notice the baby and go right to petting the cat or dog.   You did nothing wrong and I'm sure the dog would agree that he's better than the baby.", "NTA.

You could have been a little more aware but NTA.", "NTA. Lol what? That woman is nuts. Why would she expect you to coo over her baby? Not everyone loves babies, and this baby was literally asleep. I probably wouldn\u2019t have really noticed the kid either in your situation. The puppy was actually awake and engaging with you and was clearly enjoying the attention, whereas the baby wasn\u2019t even doing anything to pull your attention away from the adorable puppy. \n\nEven if the baby had been awake, there\u2019s no reason why she should have expected you to acknowledge the baby when the puppy was clearly taking up all of your attention. I honestly feel bad for the husband in this situation, she made a perfectly normal interaction extremely awkward and he was clearly embarrassed by her behavior.", "NTA \n\nGeesh, people need to get over themselves.\n\nIt wouldn't have killed you to say \"oh and you have a beautiful baby\".  But as a parent, I don't want strangers coming up and touching/cooing at my babies.  As for dogs, everyone knows they're attention magnets.", "NTA", "NTA. One, and nothing against babies, but they get cuter as they get more interactive, and they're cuter when they belong to your friends or family members. Animals are cute as newborns and when they're elderly. I wonder if this new mom is having a bit of difficulty postpartum. If I were out in a park with a newborn, I don't know if I'd welcome a stranger getting into the baby's face to coo.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. She's attaching her self-worth to her baby - your lack of adoration for her baby was taken as a personal insult. It's a her problem.", "NTA. We have a super friendly lab that loves attention from strangers, so he tends to get lots of attention when we go to the park. Any day now our first child will be born and I feel like I will honestly be a little weirded out if someone gave the same attention to my baby. I know strangers will probably approach me with my baby and I should be prepared for that, but it\u2019s just seems a little weird to me. Like I will happily wave to babies and little kids, but anything else kinda seems like I would be overstepping. They don\u2019t know me so why would they want me cooing over their kid? So if I were in the position of the parents in the park I would happily let you pet my dog and ignore my baby, that seems a lot more natural to me. But maybe that is just me being an introvert.", "NTA. Babies really aren\u2019t cute when compared with puppies. I think that\u2019s objectively true. I\u2019ve come up with an entire dialogue about other people\u2019s babies so I never have to lie and say they are cute. Especially the first month\u2026not objectively cute.", "NTA but honestly more than 30 seconds petting a stranger's dog (with permission) is a little weird.

As someone who thought they would be child free for life, (I now have a toddler by choose.), I still prefer animals more than people most of the time. I love my kid. But that doesn't mean everyone else has to work will.", "NTA.", "NTA. I know the name of almost every dog in my apartment building but I can't tell you the name of even 1 of their owners. Also, some people are hella weird when you mention their babies, so I just avoid it most of the time.", "NTA. I have children and I'm still more likely to get all googly-eyed over someone's puppy than their baby. Don't stress it, she's a hormonal new mom and her husband was probably mortified that she made it a thing.", "NTA. And it is a good thing that babies usually are so very appealing to their own mothers, because they usually aren't to anybody else, whereas puppies need to be universally adorable since most of them get adopted shortly after birth.", "NAH. You aren\u2019t a baby person and lots of people aren\u2019t. Nothing wrong with that. It sounds like you didn\u2019t even notice the baby you were so wrapped up in dog cuteness. \n\nOn the other side of things, if the new mum is in the early postnatal period (at one month she will be) then she\u2019s probably a bundle of hormones and her brain has probably rewired itself to think her baby is the most important thing in the entire world. I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s a crazy time!\n\nI wouldn\u2019t give it another thought! X", "NAH\n\nShe's probably just got those strong post-pregnancy mama bear hormones.

That was hilarious tho \ud83d\ude02 Can just imagine the mum gradually heating up as she realises she\u2019s not going to get the proxy compliment of getting her baby cooed over! And then she just snapped and had to say something! Love it", "[deleted]", "NTA, and by her expletive about the dog, it sounds like she has existing issues about the puppy (like whether it was a good idea to have a new energetic puppy at the same time as a newborn) and you stepped into it unknowingly. Her reaction wasn\u2019t really about you.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Another entitled mother", "So crazy to me that so many people say babies aren't cute. They are extraordinary and amazing even if they are a little scrunched up looking for a few days after birth. They aren't as interactive right away as a puppy, so maybe that's why people who don't have babies, or who don't have contact with them on the regular don't realize how great they are.
