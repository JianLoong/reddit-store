At first, I figured I might\u2019ve overstayed my welcome, so I decided to back off. I got up and said something like \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to your walk now, but thank you so much, that was the highlight of my day!\u201d\n\nAs the husband was saying goodbye to me, the wife interrupts him and goes \u201cReally?\u201d I was pretty confused, so I asked her if something was wrong. See, the couple also had a baby with them, a little girl sleeping in a stroller. I\u2019m bad with ages, but if I had to guess she was probably around a month-ish old. The wife said I was \u201cbeyond rude\u201d for spending all this time \u201ccooing over the damn dog\u201d but not saying anything about her newborn.\n\nI have absolutely nothing against babies or children in the slightest, including this woman\u2019s daughter.

This is to say, I\u2019ve never really been the type to coo at babies. I don\u2019t hate or dislike them at all, I just regard them in the same way I regard all strangers regardless of age.\n\nAnyway, before I could get a word in, the husband began ushering her away and told me to have a good day, though I could still hear her muttering things about me under her breath as they left.

We have a super friendly lab that loves attention from strangers, so he tends to get lots of attention when we go to the park. Any day now our first child will be born and I feel like I will honestly be a little weirded out if someone gave the same attention to my baby. I know strangers will probably approach me with my baby and I should be prepared for that, but it\u2019s just seems a little weird to me. Like I will happily wave to babies and little kids, but anything else kinda seems like I would be overstepping. They don\u2019t know me so why would they want me cooing over their kid?

They are extraordinary and amazing even if they are a little scrunched up looking for a few days after birth. They aren't as interactive right away as a puppy, so maybe that's why people who don't have babies, or who don't have contact with them on the regular don't realize how great they are. However, you are NTA because there's no obligation to compliment a baby.

It\u2019s baby number number 2 but her first was 12 years ago when she was 16. So, this was her \u201cfirst, actual baby\u201d, as is what it felt like. This one had a baby shower, a party after the birth, lots of posts on FB, etc. I was older this time around and went to the baby shower and went to \u201cmeet the baby\u201d, even though, frankly, I didn\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t going for the food or party as they\u2019re pretty trashy (long history, but short and sweet: bad with money, wife beaters, pretty yeehaw, and ex coke addict) and their food isn\u2019t particularly good. I don\u2019t believe in family is everything, but I went out of respect. Anyway, I didn\u2019t hold her, wasn\u2019t around her much, and declined (politely) anyone asking if I wanted to. At one point my cousin tried to jokingly force me to hold her and I got up so fast and ran like she was shoving a poopy diaper in my face. Probably very childish, but yknow, I don\u2019t like kids. I didn\u2019t want to be pooped on, pissed on, or thrown up on, or have my hair pulled, etc. plus, I hate the crying. She laughed, all was well, but she\u2019ll still jokingly ask if I want to hold her and I turn my nose up (again, I know, childish), and say no. The baby started crying and my mom made a comment on how cute the cries were and, again, I turned my nose up. Just because she\u2019s my cousins kid doesn\u2019t mean I have to hold her. I\u2019m not mean to her, or any other smaller kids in my family, but I just simply hate kids. I\u2019m not one that badmouths kids or anything, but if you ask, I say I don\u2019t like them nor do I want them, I don\u2019t want to babysit nor hold them, or be left alone for any period of time with them. \n\nNow, onto a possible PPD, yea, sure, I get that. It was my first thought. But, you never really know. Could be, could not be. But, just because she\u2019s going through it doesn\u2019t mean she has the right to be a dick. That\u2019s like saying my depression and s-dal tendencies allows me to automatically be rude. It\u2019s slightly different, I won\u2019t argue there, but you don\u2019t owe anyone anything in life. Basic respect, sure. But, if you don\u2019t show me respect, why should I show you respect? For all you know I just had a miscarriage and the thought of babies makes me cry, but I wanted to pet the doggy because it reminded me of my recently passed dog, or even a family pup I haven\u2019t seen in awhile. OP even mentions that her dog recently passed and the dog looked exactly like/similar to her pupper. Now, if my cat, who is almost 17, passed away and I ran into a cat that looked like her, I\u2019d have to really try very hard to keep it together. Even now I get emotional just *thinking* about her dying. From the way OP worded it, the dog passing was recent. So, I\u2019d assume 2-6 months. I wouldn\u2019t emotionally be prepared to pet another kitty that looked like my princess (I still would), and I\u2019d pet and cry to myself after. How do we know OP wasn\u2019t in the same boat? Sure, could be reaching here, but *I\u2019m just saying*.\n\nI think people who go up to babies to say hi are kinda weird, but that\u2019s me. A pet is different. OP is allowed to pet a dog without caring about an infant, or any child of any age, and the woman was kind of a dick about it. If it were me, I won\u2019t lie to you, my first reaction probably would\u2019ve been \u201cI hate kids\u201d or \u201cbabies are ugly honestly\u201d, or something of that nature. I don\u2019t owe anyone not respecting my boundaries a peaceful or nice response if they aren\u2019t nice. If the woman was nice about it, I would\u2019ve been nice and politely said something in response.", "A lot of people love babies. So you're wrong.

I\u2019ve never been able to understand people who insist on saying hi to babies. It\u2019s just so incredibly weird. My mom would talk about when my sister was a baby, because she was white and we were in Japan, a lot of people ig wanted to see her and she would always be stopping so people could say hi and at one point was in the newspaper for being a cute, fat, white baby. To me, that\u2019s just super creepy. \n\nLike, on the very off chance that when I grow up more, I do decide I want kids, I wouldn\u2019t want random strangers coming up and saying hi to my baby or touching them.

I had a friend with fraternal twin toddlers and she was kind of annoyed that everyone gushed at the one twin's perfect ringlets and didn't have anything to say to the bald twin.

I also didn\u2019t like being forced to hold the baby when I explicitly said no at least a dozen times, which is what led to me turning my nose up) can be childish.
