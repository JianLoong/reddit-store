His career is something finance related and she moved into his penthouse just over a month ago.\n\nMe (51m) and my wife (46f) have both been unhappy by this decision as when we met him for dinner a couple of times over the summer, he would just be thinking rather than talking, glaring at us and fake laughing. He seemed overly manipulative, arrogant and my daughter has been completely different since, very distant & defensive.\n\nOne thing me and my wife advised her to do was to not move in with this guy as he seems like bad news, she proceeded to do this and knew how we felt about it and him. Maybe it\u2019s her naivety or the fact that he fuels her materialistic desires by getting her as she pleases, but, he just seems cold and doesn\u2019t show us any emotions, he just proceeds to overanalyse us. \n\nMy daughter knows that I don\u2019t like him though her mother puts on a facade as she thinks her daughter is just \u201cyoung & in love with a wrong man\u201d. But, the stay at home girlfriend thing was the last straw for me. \n\nI convinced my wife to understand my perspective, she did. My daughter comes home for Christmas ever since leaving for college, though this time when she called me, I told her that \u201cshe can celebrate in her new home & understand that I would much rather prefer if I don\u2019t see her\u201d. My daughter got upset by this and she told her mother, her mother got upset at me for being so \u201charsh\u201d, though I felt justified in my actions. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671581060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zr43vg/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_come_home/", "score": 929, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And is she doing well in her college classes?", "YTA-\n\nCongrats to you for pushing your daughter away and into that guys arms.

You're making shit worse and taking away an opportunity for her to get away from what you think is a bad situation. \n\nConversely you're taking away her ability to convince you you're wrong about him if that's the case.\n\nYour daughter is an adult.

So she\u2019ll likely be alone with no means of escape if he is in fact abusive. A+ parenting there dude. Obviously YTA..", "YTA. You're worried that this new man in her life is causing her to become distant and defensive. And yet you go and alienate her from a family gathering. I'm not going to even suggest that I can understand your perspective because she is your daughter and you will always want to protect her and her best interests. But your wife is right about you being harsh. All you can do as a parent to an adult daughter who is making a mistake and won't listen is to be there to support her and pick up the pieces when sh\\*t hits the fan. It's not the best solution and will most likely cause resentment. But your support and love for her now is much more important.", "Hmmm, what an odd stance you\u2019re taking.

She may have made some questionable decisions, but do you really want her to be left with nowhere to go and perhaps feel stuck with this guy you say is so bad? If things go badly do you not want her to feel comfortable in coming to you for help? Your actions now are telling her she can not. \n\nBe her safe place; especially around Christmas, but always.

You are being a judgmental AH.", "He doesn\u2019t sound like a great guy and that age gap is concerning, but you\u2019re also 100% just pushing her further into his manipulative clutches by excluding her from family gatherings. \n\nYour daughter is still a teenager - show her love, acceptance, and lead by example. You\u2019re heading down a scary path with your current actions and YTA", "YTA! She needs your help and support now, not rejection. If you do this, she'll be even more stuck with the creep!", "YTA.  Parenting adults is an art.  You're still drawing stick figures, and poorly.    \nDon't you remember when you were a young adult?  Bad ideas galore, regrettable decisions, but it's all a part of growing up.  I do not always agree with my 20-something's decisions.  But as I call it, they are in the \"figure-it-out-years.\" They know that they can call me and/or come here at any time, they know I can be a sounding board and not a judge of their behavior.  They will have all their own consequences of good decisions and also questionable decisions.  But they always, always have me on their team.  What you're doing is alienating your daughter.  Yikes.  YTA, once again for good measure.", "YTA. Have you considered the fact that, if your daughter is in an abusive relationship, she'll need your support now more than ever? Instead, you're encouraging her to distance and isolate herself from you even more by being outwardly judgmental.\n\nEven if she's not in an abusive relationship, YTA. Your idea of normalcy, success, and happiness does not dictate what she, an adult woman, does with her life.", "YTA\n\nThe reason I say this is that you are showing your daughter that if she realises that she's made a mistake with the guy she's with now, that there is no way to she can come to you gor advice. You've literally closed that door and have essentially disowned her.\n\nYour daughter will make some mistakes in life and she will need to know that she can come to her parents for help, support and advice when asked. Mist of all she will need to know that she can come to you for this.\n\nIf you apologise to her for closing that door and opening it to her, she will hopefully see that you are a human and sometimes make rash decisions out of anger that can later be looked at and be forgiven.\n\nDon't throw your relationship away because you don't like a guy you barely know. Maybe he finds it difficult to show his true colours. Some men are taught that it's all about the money. Maybe you can teach him that life and relationships are about more than that.

He may learn from you and you from him.", "I come here everyday somehow surprised by people's stupidity. YTA. Also, you're the one doing the manipulation. Totally, 100% YOU. It's really dumb that you can't see that.", "YTA - so you think this man is grooming her and instead of keeping lines of communication/trust open, so if she ever decides to bail she can rely on you. You turn your backs on her.\n\nYou realize you\u2019re pushing her more towards him, right?\n\nShe\u2019s also a college student. Not a stay-at-home girlfriend.", "You don\u2019t like him, think he\u2019s manipulative, he has the financial upper hand in the relationship and your wife thinks he\u2019s bad news\u2026 AND your daughter has already started distancing herself. \nSuper smart move to isolate her further and create an us-them divide for her to feel defensive over. Thank goodness d*mestic *buse doesn\u2019t usually start with the abuser separating their partner from their support network. OH WAIT.\n\nGood god, man. YTA. Grow up, call your daughter and apologise. Tell her you were being overprotective but of course you\u2019d love to see her.", "YTA. I was once 19 in an abusive relationship and my dad cut me off. I ended up homeless and pregnant(by partner r*pe) and nowhere to turn. We still to this day have a rocky relationship, and I\u2019m 26 now.", "YTA and being short sighted. If she's in an abusive relationship with her way too old boyfriend, you want to keep connected to her so she knows she can come home when things get weird. And they will get weird. \n\nNo healthy 29 year old picks a 19 year old as a partner and interferes with her growth and education. He wants a gullible trophy not a partner.

Their safety comes before ANYTHING, my wants, desires, or what I thought would be best for them. Non of that matters in the face of possible abuse. \n\nYeah yta", "YTA. I understand you not liking the boyfriend or the situation and I think it sounds terrible too but if you want to protect your daughter you need to remain a positive force in her life and not force her into the arms of this potential abuser.", "YTA\u2026 you said you think he\u2019s manipulative so you\u2019re choosing to make her feel like she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go if there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re right? Make that make sense please.", "YTA. You can't shut out  your children when they make choices you disagree with and especially if it is a bad choice.  Don't take away what might ultimately be her safe place if this man ends up manipulating or abusing her in the future. You are her parent, that does not end when your child grows up and moves away. Leave the light on and the door unlocked to your children always.", "YTA. if you're worried your daughter may be harmed (emotionally or psychologically) by this man, why close yourself off to her? you're making an issue between the two of you and (god forbid) there is an issue between her and her bf in the future, she'd be less likely to come to you for help because of your actions and any damage you have done to your relationship with her.\n\nedit for clarity", "YTA. You could of checked in with her at Christmas and said your concerns. A good parent would of told her you would be there no matter what, even though you don\u2019t agree with her decisions. A good parent is supposed to standby and help when needed as their child grows and learns adulthood. The time to train then is when their young, so what did y\u2019all do wrong? Sounds like daddy issues.", "YTA and making a big mistake. If this guy is bad news, why would you force her to stay with him, when she could be home with her family? Also, your child does something you disapprove of and you decide you don't want to see her. Maybe your daughter chose an emotionless man because she lived with a dad who couldn't control his.", "YTA. Sounds like she leapt from one cold, manipulative, controlling man (you) to another. Apparently you dislike who you see in the mirror and are punishing your daughter as a result. \n\nYou can fix this, fix yourself, and be the kind of father a daughter turns to when she needs help or you can stand your ground and contribute to extending the reach of her mistake far into her future. Look to your wife for guidance in how to proceed if you choose the former as it sounds like she has a better idea how to handle it. Keep your daughter and her bf close unless you want to lose her.", "INFO\n\nWhat is your intention with this behavior?? What\u2019s the goal?", "You think the guy is bad news, manipulative and your daughter is making a mistake, and instead of being even more present and vigilant for her and letting her know her family will always love and be here for her, you chase her away and basically make him her only resort and the \"good guy\". And for Christmas too! Yeah YTA big time.", "\"I think this guy's my daughter is dating is bad news, so I did exactly what he wanted me to do and I pushed my daughter away and now if anything serious happens to her she won't come to me for help\".\nFixed your post, YTA.\nAnd you better pray your intuition is wrong, because if you're right about him, you just made his plans a hell of a lot easier.", "YTA\n\nThere's 2 scenarios here:\n\n1. You're being a controlling AH and judging this dude based off very little ( you haven't given us any specific examples of what he's doing won't).\n\n2. The BF is being a controlling AH and you have a chance to have a rational conversation and possibly save your daughter from a bad situation and instead are abandoning her on Christmas \n\nEither way terrible terrible parenting", "YTA. You think your the only dad that doesn't like his daughters boyfriend? Other than just being cold to you (which btw, people can tell when they aren't liked, so maybe you gave a bad first impression too) what has he done to offend you so greatly? Make more money than you? Buy her things you can't? Give her a nicer place to live than you did? I would be crushed if my father said that he didn't want to see me for Christmas because I met a man more successful than him. Crazy...\n\nOr fake.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is dating a guy you don't trust... So your going to cut her off why so she won't be able to leave him ?? Did you know the first thing an abusive person does is try to cut their partner off from friends and family ? If he is bad news and abusive you just did that for him awesome job dad !\n\nAlso as a side note your \" stay at home girlfriend\" was the last straw .... She is an adult she isn't asking for your help you don't get a say in what she does ( or doesn't) do for a living. Sorry she is t good enough for you", "YTA. That will just isolate her even more and make her easier to manipulate and/or abuse", "YTA.  And you are doing exactly what an abuser would want.  Abusers isolate their victims.   Your PRIDE has made you make a very bad choice.  If you children are in a bad place, love and support them.  Let the school of hard knocks do the teaching instead. And be there to help when it is needed.  \n\nAnd if he is not an abuser, you handed her you business card stating you own and control her.  She is unlikely to accept an attitude in which you withhold you love and support if she doesn\u2019t obey you still.   \n\nRegardless, I wish you the best as you navigate parenting an adult.   It is soooo much harder than parenting a child.", "YTA. You\u2019re worried this man is bad news and your solution is to isolate her further from a support network?! You can\u2019t be serious. \n\nI\u2019d be concerned about the relationship too but you need to make it clear you are 100% there for her and model mature, respectful relationships for her. No wonder she\u2019s ended up with a jerk when her own father acts so immature honestly.\n\nAlso please make sure she has access to her own finances (like an emergency fund at least).", "YTA.  The only appropriate response to any of this is to tell your daughter that you worry about her, and that you don't have a good feeling about this guy, but you are going to keep an open mind and get to know him more, and if she ever needs to escape, at any time, for any reason, you will be there for her and help her get out.\n\nAt this point, if she does need help because this guy turns out to be awful, she sure won't think she can turn to you.  Why would you help her escape an abusive situation when you won't even let her come for Christmas.  Disgusting.", "Wow, listen to yourself\n\n\"My daughter is in an obviously abusive relationship and I want to cut her off from family and further drive her into the arms of her abuser so she will no longer have any means of escape\"\n\nYTA", "Yta. You are renouncing your daughter because you don't like her bf? You declare you don't want her home for Christmas, she has no home with you anymore, because of it? Nothing she has done not even anything he has done only that you don't like the way he behaves? OK, I wouldn't like my kid to be a stay at home girlfriend either. But the kid herself would always be more important, and you are firmly pressing her into his arms by closing the door at her. Just a wild guess, but maybe she wants a lover who gives her the feeling that he would be there for her and give her everything she needs because she doesn't have the foundation of a family giving this to her.", "YTA. If you think that he is a bad influence on her then why are you removing any good influences on her -meaning you! If this turns abusive then she might not think that you will accept her if she decides to leave. You need to keep an open door policy for your daughter especially because you believe her to be in a toxic relationship!", "YTA.\n\nYeah, it sounds like she\u2019s in a sketchy relationship and that sucks but she\u2019s also 19. She\u2019s allowed to make mistakes of who she dates. And one day when she figures that out, she\u2019s going to need to know that her parents love her and will happily welcome her back. Instead you\u2019re pushing her away and making her feel alone. She\u2019s going to stay with him to spite you and if things go wrong she won\u2019t think she can turn to you. Excellent work.", "YTA, congratulations on just pushing her closer to the guy you don\u2019t like. If you don\u2019t think this is good for her, be supportive of her. You have a right to say you don\u2019t want him in your home and that you don\u2019t support the relationship but don\u2019t burn the bridge that allows her to leave him either. She\u2019s young, almost all of us have made a bad relationship choice when young. That was harsh based on what info you gave.", "YTA love you daughter and support her. You can't control an adult. What if he is bad? Wouldn't her coming home for the holidays give her a chance to reflect on this. Unless you daughter is damaging the house or being horrible why would you not want her there? You are disgusting.", "YTA. So you think she\u2019s with a bad guy\u2026but you want to banish her from your home\u2026a place she should feel safe and loved. Not a good plan man", "YTA. Your daughter is in the grip of a predator, you've SEEN him on his GOOD behavior, and you're letting him distance her from her family. Invite her, not him. Tell her that she's always got a place with you and you'll come get her when (not if) it gets bad. Give her some good advice about keeping important documents in a bank lockbox or elsewhere, and making sure he can't access her money. If he turns out to be okay? No harm done. But wealthy 29 year olds don't date teenagers unless they're such creeps that women their own age know better. Edited to add: Make sure she's got an IUD or implant because trapping her with a pregnancy is a no-brainer to the sort of guy that likely is. AT THE LEAST protect her from that.", "YTA. It's time to remind your daughter what a smart, capable woman she is and how proud of her accomplishments. Hell, I would spend the whole dang break bragging to boyfriend how loved and cherished by her family. Remind daughter if her boyfriend drops dead tomorrow, she is entitled to nothing. No money, no penthouse, not a red cent. Ask boyfriend how he plans to circumvent that. It would be unwise not to think ahead, right? I mean, the boyfriend thinks he is awfully clever. Whatever you do, do not push her further into his arms. \n\nWhat's the sayings? Keep friends close, enemies closer? You attract more fly's with honey than vinegar. Kill'em with kindness.", "YTA so your idea of good parenting is to alienate your child that you think is in a abusive relationship.", "YTA. You might not agree with her choices, and I don\u2019t necessarily fault you from that, but your alienating your daughter and if/when this turns bad, she needs to be able to come to you.", "OK, so this guy may well be bad news, but it's a good thing her parents are there to support her when things go bad, right?\n\nOops, no, you're not going to do shit.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nShe is your DAUGHTER, and a damned adult.

I (36M) am arrogant and rather emotionless, except around my son. This doesn\u2019t make me a bad person.  It makes me difficult to get along with.  But the thing is I don\u2019t do this on purpose.  I find people and all of their complex emotions difficult to understand and connect with. Because of this difficulty I ask questions that seem leading or,as you put it, overanalysing. Now I\u2019m not saying that this is the same thing you are experiencing with your daughter\u2019s bf, but your nagging control will I doubt have the opposite effect you are hoping for. Learn to empathise and support your daughter in her decisions, whether you agree with them or not. And try to connect with your daughter\u2019s bf.  It is possible you are miss understanding him.", "im leaning for sure YTA becuase your bascially being manipulative becuase of the fact u dont like her bf and he takes care of her etc.  you sound very judgemental and dont be surprised since u rejected your daughter now she goes no contact and ends up getting married to this man\n\nand by the way the bf who is in finance has a analytical mind not an emotional one.  so they tend to be sometimes introverted and bored.", "I\u2019d also love to know what kind of a play OP thinks it is to tell her to stay at home instead of visiting you. Sounds pretty manipulative to me. \nWhat a great male role model you must have been. No wonder she went for such a charming guy.", "YTA \n\nYou need to leave the door open for her.  You\u2019re playing into his game because he\u2019ll frame it to his advantage", "YTA the title alone is enough for me to tell that", "YTA. She's an adult; she's going to make mistakes. Maybe this guy is a mistake, maybe not. Her choice to make and her lesson to learn. \n\nYou've already offered your opinion.

You do not own them and you do not command them as your servants to do as you say.\n\nYou may believe this is tough love. It appears to be a young vulnerable woman who is being rejected by her own family so she's forced to stay in a potentially financially/emotionally/verbally/ physically abusive relationship because she doesn't have anywhere to turn. \n\nNow she is extra afraid to leave this guy because you've shown her that returning to your household means suffering the pain of judgement and condescension for 'not knowing better' or 'told you so' attitude.

You don't like this guy? Then give her someplace to go when she's ready.

You can \"feel\" justified all you want, but you're creating a perfect excuse for her to cut you out and be unable to help her in the future. I don't think you're *intending* to do this, a lot of well-intentioned people isolate victims of manipulative and abusive persons because it's very painful and difficult to watch someone make (possible) mistakes and put themselves into dangerous situations, however it's *unwise* to behave this way.

It's a bit dated but it is very, very helpful and guided me when I was supporting a friend in a (overtly) abusive relationship\n* It isn't published by a professional but for a breakdown of some important concepts, this article by Captain Awkward [here](https://captainawkward.com/2012/06/19/272-when-you-see-darth-vader-coming/) where \"darth vader\" boyfriend can be replaced by manipulative person/negative influence, is very helpful \n* If you are open to it, having a therapist who is familiar with manipulation and family dynamics could be useful to have in your corner. My therapist was absolutely critical in helping me reframe my attempts to be helpful and supportive to be more 'acceptable' for my friend. There were times we were in conflict that was baffling and scary for me. She lost all her friends because they held an intervention for her unless she broke up with her ex....all her friends except for me, because I was uncomfortable with ultimatums and I **knew** she would pick her husband over him. It also overlooked a big issue in her life i.e. she hated when people were controlling or condescending, which many interventions come across as\n* Check out what resources are in her area and yours that support women in crisis, families, etc. because they often have advocates and persons who can be supportive *for you* as well as her, and make sure that you can have an eye on the red flags\n* If all else fails, embrace the fact that your wife has a relationship independent from you with your daughter because oftentimes even a single lifeline that feels more \"approving\"/less judgemental is going to be the source that someone reaches out for, for help. Discuss safety planning with her, on how to handle things like this in the future, and rely on her expertise (as well as her sensing when things are too stressful)\n* be prepared to feel frustrated, powerless, and afraid but know that you aren't alone in this. It was very, very scary for me to go through this and there was vicarious trauma from my friend. There were times where my empathy was depleted and I was angry that I was in the position to be supportive when, to me, it felt like all the red flags were there all along. It took active work to note when I was burnt out, and to identify that part of why I was angry was because I was so incredibly worried and afraid.  Anger gives you energy.  Frustration and indignance do as well. We don't want to be controlling because we're mean, but because we'd do anything to help prevent our loved one from experiencing pain and being victimized. Note the times when you feel the most urge to take action, and take a deep breath/sleep on it first.\n\n\nAnd, the most upsetting of all: be prepared for the fact that you *could* be wrong. This person who seems awful to you could be meeting some very important needs. For my friend, her ex helped her get a new job, into therapy, and always had her back in some ways that her family and friends did not.  You say he seems cold/unemotional?

Friends, are unacceptable, then families are discouraged. This guy is probably quite content that you would help you in his plan isolate her completely. People like him create situations where the often very young women, (your daughter is an actual teenager with a man who will soon be 30), slowly have no one. By this time confidence is gone, and the abuse escalates. Victims are afraid to leave, afraid to call their loved ones, the police, or anyone who might be able to help. Unfortunately too often the abuse continues. Children are sometimes brought into the horror, for all the wrong reasons, making leaving even more difficult, and the cycle continues.....\n\nI'm not going to sugar coat this: Abusers do not stop without extreme intervention and treatment, which is rare.

Trying to make her dump him could just result in bad feelings towards her dad too, even if she follows through with it on her own accord.", "Thank you. That was driving me crazy. Makes sooo much more sense in that context.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one confused by the stay-at-home label! And she\u2019s \u201caway\u201d at school, not taking online classes, so WTF is the problem? \n\nOh yeah, the greasy 29 y/o finance guy.", "I was thinking the same thing.  OP sounds super controlling and manipulative. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if his daughter has explained what he is like to her boyfriend and the result is that the boyfriend hates OP.", "Are we still doing phrasing?", "She is manipulated and probably scared about the power he has over her. You do not know how she feels or what more happens at home. Don\u2019t you dare say she knows better when you know next to nothing about whats going on outside of OP\u2019s perspective", "Same here. My parents taught me what healthy support looked like even when I was in unhealthy situations. I wouldn't say I have an entirely secure attachment style now, but it's a heck of a lot more secure than if my dad was like this guy.\n\nAlso had the same question about the definition of SAHG", "You are probably right", "I was going to say - don't we often end up dating people who have some of our parent's traits? I wonder why she started dating somebody controlling and manipulative", "Seemed to me the BF was just quiet. My husband is very quiet around people he doesn\u2019t know/isn\u2019t comfortable with. Doesn\u2019t mean someone is \u201cbad news\u201d", "The ages alone make it creepy", "I wonder if in some way she's attracted to the controlling behavior of her bf because it's what she grew up with.... It's familiar and comforting.", "Eureka! Another commenter pointed out he probably meant live-in, not stay-at-home. Total speculation, but makes much more sense to my tired brain.", "I was a support system for someone I barely knew. We were coworkers but she had no one so of course I stepped up. I would do it for an acquaintance but he won\u2019t for his daughter? It\u2019s disgusting honestly", "I wouldn't trust OP's version of events, maybe the dude can see how shitty she's treated at home and that's why he prefers to avoid them.", "Hard agree on this.", "You're right but i also definitely dated people ten years older than me at that age. The relationships didn't last long because i was too young to know what i really wanted and i don't think they were bad people. We just happened to be in social settings that nullified the age difference. So it's not great, but it depends how they met.", "He's a near 30 year old man dating a teenager", "I agree that the ages are potentially problematic but that doesn't mean that the boyfriend is mistreating her or that her father doesn't. In fact, one of OP's issues with the boyfriend is that he buys her anything she wants and fuels her \"materialistic desires\". It seems he's more upset that she did something that he didn't want her to do and because she's seemingly happy with her decision, he wants to punish her for it.", "Only on reddit. In the real world adults date other adults all the time, and the ridiculous \"age gap\" nonsense never even comes into play.", "I think if it were a sugar baby relationship where she's just in it for the money, they probably wouldn't live together and he probably wouldn't be spending this much time with her parents. And the financial/age gap would still be concerning IMO--unless he's giving her cash that she can use to fall back on if the relationship ends, he can kick her out basically at any time with no recourse (even if she theoretically had rights as a tenant--what 19 year-old with no money would be able to figure that out and do anything about that)?\n\nI think the boyfriend here is absolutely TA, and we don't necessarily have enough info to tell if the dad is frustrated by his daughter being in this situation and handling it poorly as a result or if he's just an overall shitty parent and his daughter just wants to get away from him. I'm inclined to think it's the former since it sounds like she *wants* to come home for Christmas, but he definitely needs to rethink the way he's handling the situation before he pushes her away permanently.", "Uh two adults are dating", "That in itself isn't necessarily a problem.  Granted it doesn't look great, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything either.", "A person in their late 20's dating a teenager is sketchy in the real world too. How did these people even meet each other? She was just out of high school dating a 28 year old? BF is sketchy.", "Yes they do lol.", "also like isn't attitude and fake laughing just op's perspective?\nyeah the age gap is bad so i don't like either party here, but it doesn't sound like the bf is doing much else unless we get more context", "I don't trust the boyfriend either but if he is abusive (I would love to know for certain if they started dating after she turned 18 - it's not clear) her dad is not showing that he's a good support option. And beyond that, who turns down a visit from their own child when said child is potentially in a harmful relationship??", "Your friend is very lucky to have you. I hope she gets out safely. Must be tough for you to watch it having been there. But you are right, you understand better than anyone what she is going through. I wish her and you lots of happiness", "Jealous? What reasonable parent would be happy with their 19 year old daughter to be a stay at home girlfriend? Why would he be jealous? Your comment is reaching and assuming a LOT.", "Yeah, I'm saying the dad is also in the wrong, I just can't tell from the information here whether he's being an asshole in this specific situation but could change his behavior and be better, or whether he's just an asshole in general.", "Except he also says that she's in her second year of college. So she's not a stay at home girlfriend so much as her boyfriend is financially supporting her whole she gets her degree.", "OP is not a reasonable parent."]}
