I know I\u2019m not going to church and I don\u2019t want to get to their house hours early just for my mom to micromanage and criticize everything I do. My sister feels the same way. She has a newborn baby and doesn\u2019t want to be there all day. We went to our parents\u2019 house together and said that we\u2019re coming for dinner at the same time as the boys do and will bring something we made at home. Mom acted like we just told her we\u2019re never going to see her again. Started crying about how I\u2019m selfish because I\u2019m single with no kids, what could I possibly be doing instead. How she prepared an entire feast less than a week after giving birth, but my sister can\u2019t handle it 3 months after having a baby. She kept going on and on about how it\u2019s not fair she has to do all the work, and would not let us try to explain that she doesn\u2019t have to do everything by herself, just let us make food at home and come for dinner. \n\nMom finally agreed that my sister could come at dinner time since being there all day would disrupt the baby\u2019s nap time. But she still insisted I come early. I said I\u2019ll cook at home and come at 3pm to help set the table (everyone else is coming at 4:30pm) and Mom said \u201cif you hate spending time with me so much then just don\u2019t come at all.\u201d So I said fine. I won\u2019t come at all. Mom told me to get out of her house so I left. That was 3 nights ago and I haven\u2019t heard from her.\n\nI\u2019m new to this whole boundaries thing. It was hard enough for me to confront Mom at all, and my plan was just to put my foot down and insist that I\u2019ll come for dinner but not hour early. Wasn\u2019t planning on saying I won\u2019t come at all, even though Mom told me not to. I know she didn\u2019t mean it, but I\u2019m bitter about it anyway. Thanksgiving is over a week ago so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll call me before then, but I really think I\u2019m going to skip this year.

Re read your last sentence. If your mom doesn't understand your need for time to yourself after all that, it speaks volumes about her selfish entitlement.", "NTA. It's also ridiculous that you're expected to clean and cook and get there much earlier to do so while the males get to watch TV and be served. Nope, as a parent I'd refuse to let my kids participate in such a sexist tradition. Everyone physically capable helps with cleaning and cooking to the best of their abilities. My  kids clear their plates at 2 years old!", "When you start setting boundaries, the people in your life who are used to your old pushover self will throw tantrums in an attempt to restore the status quo. This is normal: your mother is used to having you do whatever she wants - and when you begin heeding your own wishes and preferences instead of hers, she feels you are slipping away from her grip.\n\nStay firm. Polite but firm. Do not explain yourself (\u201cNeed time on my own to recharge\u201d is a perfectly valid reason to skip family functions). Your mother will have a few more tantrums - and will eventually adjust to the new normal.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Mother dearest needs to learn boundaries...", "NTA - I wish my wife would set boundaries with her family the way you are. I am proud of you for standing up for yourself and making it known you will not be bullied.", "Umm she uninvited you. Your free and clear to just chill on Thanksgiving", "NTA. Your mother overreacted and likes to control. And it seems to be unfair between male and female in your family.", "NTA - Your mom is the one that made it all or nothing, you were willing to meet her halfway. F all that sexist BS too. Spending time with family at the holidays is supposed to make us feel good, if it only makes you feel used and unhappy - what is the point?", "NTA Yeahhh\u2026the last sentence. She\u2019s a good martyr! That takes years of practice. It\u2019s ok to set boundaries and not fall in line with family cultural expectations. You can explain that you aren\u2019t comfortable and why, over and over. \nOur family started going out or ordering pre-made dishes and it reduced the stress level so much.", "NTA. She's used to getting everything she wants and you need to get out of this as soon as possible.", "NTA. If I were not an only child, I would ask if we have the same mother. \ud83e\udd23 I have recently been through something similar myself. Creating a boundary gave me peace. I'm also concerned about the gender dynamics in your family, and why the guys are ok with contributing nothing in terms of food preparation or cleanup. I would never attend a family event on these terms again.", "NTA - don't go. Relax and enjoy the day without your mom and her 1950s woman's mentality.", "NTA. \n\nHoney, just fake covid. It works wonders.", "NTA. If it's the first time she tells you not to come at all then I would oblige and enjoy myself at home doing my own thing. Only way you'll know if the grass is greener on the other side!", "Nta. Enjoy a peaceful thanksgiving! Hope you feel better.", "You were uninvited. So your in the clear. Its important to establish boundaries", "NTA. But this will be hard for your mother to accept if she ever does. When people acquiesce to your boundaries immediately it\u2019s a good sign they weren\u2019t the reason for the boundary. \n\nI would just stick to your plan of either not going or going when the men show up. Your choice. If you choose to go and this comes up again, I probably wouldn\u2019t say anything and just leave but if you feel you need to say something I would start with \u2018Mom, none of us ever agreed to this holiday format. You insisted and then argued and cried any time someone mentioned doing something else. You may have prepared a feast within a week of giving birth but you chose to do that. Sister is choosing to protect her mental and physical health. She is not required to do anything because you did it first. I would love to see my family for Holidays but when the visit is premeditated with stress and struggle, it\u2019s no longer enjoyable. This is how I choose to participate now, you can take it or leave it but know it\u2019s your choice\u2019", "NTA.\n\nI used to fake poverty in order to avoid holiday trips home, and ensuing drama over my refusal to come. I know, the cowardice, but it was easier than the drama...\n\nDon't go. The ensuing drama will eventually die out (may take a few years).  Ignore your mother's manipulations, go LC and gray rock if the subject continues to cause problems. Eventually, the drama should fade, and your mother will learn to take \"No\" for an answer. You do you.\n\nEdit: forgot judgement", "It took me to 50 yo to set boundaries with my mom over holiday expectations. She laid a lot of guilt and I had a few bad moments. But with time it got easier.\n\nI learned two things:\n1) do not cave ever - you will have to start over completely\n2) offer two choices: my boundary limit (example 2 hrs and I am out) -or- nothing, zip, nada.\n\nBy year 2, I refused to argue, negotiate or listen to a guilt trip. I'd simply say: \"mom, there are two choices ....\". Once she realized I was happy to do zip, she accepted the '2 hrs' or whatever. (Family tried to guilt me sometimes but really they were just envious of my escape.)", "What horrible, sexist traditions your mother has perpetuated. And shame on the men for continuing it. Eating, sitting around drinking while the women cook, clean, serve, take care of kids. I would refuse based on that alone. I would encourage you to have a firm talk with brother and SIL about boundaries too.\n\nDefinitely NTA. And let all your family know why. Shame the men. Stay firm on boundaries for your time. Parents need to understand as kids get older, transitions need to flex, not stay rigid.", "NTA seems to be a fair bit of evidence in what you\\`ve said to support that. Stay at home watch the parade, have some pastries and don\\`t feel guilty.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ll be too busy trying to get knocked up so y\u2019know, not to be so selfish. /s \n\nSeriously though, she\u2019s saying some really hurtful stuff and not accepting a decent compromise. She\u2019ll be lucky if anyone wants to be around her at this rate. You have to do this so that, if she finally backs down and stops acting out, you can be firm on your boundaries.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust tell her you won't come because you have other plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou are an adult.", "NTA. You did it! You put your foot down, mom had her tantrum, and you survived. I\u2019m proud of you and your sister for stepping up to change the funky dynamics going on there. Pat yourselves on your backs!", "NTA.  Have a nice quiet day for yourself.  Pamper yourself.  Do things that make you happy.  \n\nLast time my mom tried to push me into doing something like that, I broke it down for her:\n\n* You want me to do X. \n* You are making me unhappy because I will not do X. \n* I do NOT want to do X and will be unhappy if I do it.\n* If I am going to be unhappy either way, I may as well be unhappy doing what I want to do.\n\nMade a world of difference.   Definitely made her stop at that time--probably from shock.", "Oh lord I have a similar mother.  When you start setting boundaries you are going to experience a heavy kick back. It's normal. There will be guilt trips, manipulating and stand-offs.  But the thing with boundaries is that you need to stick to them. Otherwise you are just showing your mother that she needs to escalate even further to get her own way. \n\nShe'll throw a tantrum, sulk, send in some flying monkeys, have a pity party but you need to hold strong or not even try to set them at all. \n\nShe won't contact you - she doesn't want to be the first one to break.  In her mind, right now you are the evil daughter trying to ruin thanksgiving.  You can't change that. Just send her a message saying you would love to come at 3pm, but if she still would rather you didn't then that's fine, you have other plans. NTA", "So you have painted a pretty negative picture of your mother.  But at the end of your post you basically said that you are depressed and have decided to isolate for the holiday.  To be clear NTA. But I cannot advise you to stay home alone on Thanksgiving.  Please do something.  Serve meals at a shelter.  Charity is excellent for depression.

You're not obliged to do anything she wants, you're 31 not 11 ffs! Men of course haven't two healthy hands to help, lol. This is bullcrap.

I am an old lady with no living family, so TBH, some of this stuff sounds fun, BUT if you WANT to do it. All of this is very forced.

Wow, but your mom sure is.  If she doesn\u2019t call before Thanksgiving it\u2019s just proof it\u2019s not about family, it\u2019s about her and what a wonderful person she is.  If she does call explain to her it\u2019s not the 1950\u2019s (I\u2019m 70) and women aren\u2019t expected to slave for their men.

Mine has this \"I'm your mother and you'll do what I say\" mentality. It's taken a lot of time for her to understand that I'm a grown adult with my own ability to make decisions. \n\nI'd show up, drop off some desert and visit for half an hour EVEN IF she uninvited you. She may not want you there since it's not on her terms but the rest of the family had no vote there and you should still be able to spend some time with them if you choose to. Otherwise, enjoy your day of peace and quiet.", "NTA because you are free to not do stuff you don't want to do. \n\nBut you could look at it like this: your mom wants to bond with you. This is how her mom bonded with her and how she wants to bond with you. She sees it as tradition, something handed down. Cooking together on Thanksgiving. What you see as exploitive, she sees as a nice way to spend time together. And you are not just rejecting cooking together, you're rejecting your family's tradition.  \n\nI know it sucks when your parents want to spend time with you in ways other than the ones you want. But they are people, too, and sometimes interests don't line up. The good thing is that they won't be around forever, so you won't have to worry about it after they're gone. But until then, you might want to think about appreciating them for what they are rather than what they aren't.", "NTA.  Your mom is a bully.  Honestly the best thing you could do at this point is stay home.  Warn your sister or some other responsible person that you aren't coming, and then turn your phone off and have a nice time on your own.

You fell into her trap when you said \"I won\u2019t come at all.\". I mean, if you wanted to hurt your mum then that'll do it. I'm not sure you intended that though. She's the one that set the trap, but she won't see it that way.", "Just say 'I'll come early and also help clean up as soon as the men do it all too.'

Hold your boundaries- if she wants company and help the men can come", "My thoughts are that all women in American should refuse to cook or clean on Thanksgiving this year.  Instead, we should buy extra beer and take over the recliners.", "NTA  Holidays are tough, especially with family drama. Relax and enjoy your freedom.", "Yta and I hope you never need anything ever and she disowns you.", "NTA. It is llwys difficult to set boundaries with parents. You will forever be their beloved child, no matter how old you are. It is up to you to define the boundaries, they won't do it. Sounds like maybe this conversation of stablishing boundaries should have happened some years ago. You should always care for the people who loves you as well, but make sure that the relationship does not become a burden for no reason; that is the only way that you will be willing to bear it when it actually becomes a burden and you are expected to carry with the full weight of it.", ">Nope, as a parent I'd refuse to let my kids participate in such a sexist tradition.\n\nYep time for these traditions to change, especially as there's now a new baby who should be learning to see women and men as equals. And time for the mother to learn she doesn't get to dictate what her adult children do.", "Yup. This was the pattern in my family for a long time, though to be fair my Grandpa did a lot of cooking growing up.\n\nWhen I took over cooking (out of frustration with everyone else's complaining) I made a rule that anyone who didn't bring a dish had to do dishes. That gave us a whole bunch of variety in dishes from some of my cousins who had never cooked before. Then after dinner I refused to serve dessert until dishes were done, and I stood over other my cousins while they whined and moaned and one actually burst out in crocodile tears while they did the dishes. That was unpleasant. But unlike their parents, I wouldn't let them leave or let it slide until they were done, because I knew they were capable of it. Did everyone call me names for a year? Yup. But I can handle names, what I can't handle is washing a mountain of dishes after I cooked all day while everyone else enjoys desserts I also made. \n\nGuess what? Things shifted, quickly. 2 years later I cooked everything and the one cousin who cried the first year was the one calling everyone in to do dishes. It doesn't take long to change traditions, its just hard to do it in the first place.", "This is excellent advice from Ok Bookkeeper.  You are merely claiming your basic right to fairness, on many levels.  Don't make up an excuse (illness, etc.).  Do be prepared for more tantrums in future, but calmly standing up for yourself is necessary.  Good luck.
