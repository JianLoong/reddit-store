I know I\u2019m not going to church and I don\u2019t want to get to their house hours early just for my mom to micromanage and criticize everything I do. My sister feels the same way. She has a newborn baby and doesn\u2019t want to be there all day. We went to our parents\u2019 house together and said that we\u2019re coming for dinner at the same time as the boys do and will bring something we made at home. Mom acted like we just told her we\u2019re never going to see her again. Started crying about how I\u2019m selfish because I\u2019m single with no kids, what could I possibly be doing instead. How she prepared an entire feast less than a week after giving birth, but my sister can\u2019t handle it 3 months after having a baby. She kept going on and on about how it\u2019s not fair she has to do all the work, and would not let us try to explain that she doesn\u2019t have to do everything by herself, just let us make food at home and come for dinner. \n\nMom finally agreed that my sister could come at dinner time since being there all day would disrupt the baby\u2019s nap time. But she still insisted I come early. I said I\u2019ll cook at home and come at 3pm to help set the table (everyone else is coming at 4:30pm) and Mom said \u201cif you hate spending time with me so much then just don\u2019t come at all.\u201d So I said fine. I won\u2019t come at all. Mom told me to get out of her house so I left. That was 3 nights ago and I haven\u2019t heard from her.\n\nI\u2019m new to this whole boundaries thing. It was hard enough for me to confront Mom at all, and my plan was just to put my foot down and insist that I\u2019ll come for dinner but not hour early. Wasn\u2019t planning on saying I won\u2019t come at all, even though Mom told me not to. I know she didn\u2019t mean it, but I\u2019m bitter about it anyway. Thanksgiving is over a week ago so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll call me before then, but I really think I\u2019m going to skip this year.

She\u2019s a good martyr! That takes years of practice. It\u2019s ok to set boundaries and not fall in line with family cultural expectations.

If I were not an only child, I would ask if we have the same mother. \ud83e\udd23 I have recently been through something similar myself. Creating a boundary gave me peace.

Your choice.

You insisted and then argued and cried any time someone mentioned doing something else. You may have prepared a feast within a week of giving birth but you chose to do that. Sister is choosing to protect her mental and physical health. She is not required to do anything because you did it first. I would love to see my family for Holidays but when the visit is premeditated with stress and struggle, it\u2019s no longer enjoyable.

I know, the cowardice, but it was easier than the drama...\n\nDon't go. The ensuing drama will eventually die out (may take a few years).  Ignore your mother's manipulations, go LC and gray rock if the subject continues to cause problems. Eventually, the drama should fade, and your mother will learn to take \"No\" for an answer.

Pat yourselves on your backs!", "NTA.  Have a nice quiet day for yourself.  Pamper yourself.  Do things that make you happy.  \n\nLast time my mom tried to push me into doing something like that, I broke it down for her:\n\n* You want me to do X. \n* You are making me unhappy because I will not do X. \n* I do NOT want to do X and will be unhappy if I do it.\n* If I am going to be unhappy either way, I may as well be unhappy doing what I want to do.\n\nMade a world of difference.   Definitely made her stop at that time--probably from shock.", "Oh lord I have a similar mother.  When you start setting boundaries you are going to experience a heavy kick back. It's normal. There will be guilt trips, manipulating and stand-offs.  But the thing with boundaries is that you need to stick to them. Otherwise you are just showing your mother that she needs to escalate even further to get her own way. \n\nShe'll throw a tantrum, sulk, send in some flying monkeys, have a pity party but you need to hold strong or not even try to set them at all. \n\nShe won't contact you - she doesn't want to be the first one to break.  In her mind, right now you are the evil daughter trying to ruin thanksgiving.  You can't change that.

NTA", "So you have painted a pretty negative picture of your mother.  But at the end of your post you basically said that you are depressed and have decided to isolate for the holiday.

That gave us a whole bunch of variety in dishes from some of my cousins who had never cooked before. Then after dinner I refused to serve dessert until dishes were done, and I stood over other my cousins while they whined and moaned and one actually burst out in crocodile tears while they did the dishes. That was unpleasant. But unlike their parents, I wouldn't let them leave or let it slide until they were done, because I knew they were capable of it. Did everyone call me names for a year? Yup. But I can handle names, what I can't handle is washing a mountain of dishes after I cooked all day while everyone else enjoys desserts I also made. \n\nGuess what?

This was the first time aunt\u2019s kids had ever had to help since she had all boys. It was awesome.", "Awesome story of positive change in a family, love it!", "That's an uplifting story if ever I heard one. Take my free award!", "Good for your mom!  That's awesome.", "Mom said \u201cif you hate spending time with me so much then just don\u2019t come at all.\u201d\n\nAnd that's what this is really about.  Mom is missing you guys because you've started your adult lives - in the case of your Sis a new nuclear family.  From your description of the family's traditionalism/conservatism, I'm willing to bet her identity is wrapped up in being Mom, and she doesn't know what to do with herself now that you don't need her on a daily basis anymore.  When the holidays come up, she's thinking \"Aha!  The one time of the year I can force them to have together time with me, because, major holidays!\".  This isn't really about needing the help.  It's about having one season a year when you put the rest of your busy lives on hold and focus on your family of origin - meaning her.\n\nThe two of you will have to explain to her, gently at first, that it's never going to be the same again.  If your sister has a SO, their people are going to get half the holidays.  They might not travel at all, because many people believe children should have holidays at home, and it will be up to everyone else to come to them - if, indeed, they don't decide they enjoy nesting with just their nuclear family.\n\nWhen my brother announced his engagement, I knew it meant we would only have him every other holiday regardless of where they decided to live.  I was heartbroken when they decided to live near her people instead of us.  When he divorced and married his second wife, life got so complicated that we stopped getting them for any actual holidays.  This year, my niece started her first job.  That means we're not seeing them during the holiday season at all for the first time.  Life changes.  You have to take what your loved ones can and will give you, and not be torn up about what you wish you had.", "NTA, but keep the boundaries. If you let your mother encroach just once, she will do so again, and again.", "NTA. I almost married a man whose family is like this. You basically had to drop everything to be together during Thanksgiving week doing the most pointless, overbearing shit. Even my would-have-been Father in Law absolutely felt like killing himself during that week because it was his wife and his wife's siblings that set the agenda. Set boundaries. Don't over-extend yourself. Don't be like my would-have-been Father-in-Law and die of a heart attack during the Thanksgiving stress-a-thon.", "I get this. Time to pull the sick card- because you are EMOTIONALLY sick and exhausted.", "NTA - these routines are very difficult to reshape around the adult YOU are .  She has to accept that she's not the only person involved.  She is saying she's the hostess but she wants you to help with the duties - she must compromise\n\nYour mother expects a particular kind of holiday and refuses to accept that you're not a child anymore.  Make your own holiday.\n\nI don't know who these 'men' are but I presume its your father / brothers etc.  They get to be waited on hand and foot while the women serve likes its the 1800s.\n\nIn recent years i'd go to my mother's house and prepare the bird the night before.  She would turn on the oven in the morning.  The men would do the cleaning, which is easier than the cooking.", "Hold. Your. Ground. \n\nPlan a truly fantastic solo Thanksgiving. Eat what you want, do exactly what you want, sleep as long as you like. Let her miss you. I promise you won't regret it and next year you can decide whether you actually WANT to go. \n\nNTA", "NTA you mums emotionally manipulative - keep working on those boundaries and your relationship with her will be better then ever.", "\n>My parents are the kind who think they are entitled to everyone dropping everything to attend things around the holidays including: \n-Thanksgiving eve church service\n-Thanksgiving day dinner*\n-Day after Thanksgiving leftover lunch \n-Making gingerbread houses before Christmas \n-Christmas Eve church service*\n-Christmas Eve dinner\n-Christmas morning together*\n\n>* events are non-negotiable, Mom has a meltdown if not everyone comes.

What kind of mother insists her own daughter with a new baby has to play suffering Olympics with her? \n\n>She kept going on and on about how it\u2019s not fair she has to do all the work, \n\nShe doesn't 'have' to do anything. She can say she's not making dinner this year. She can make a different, easier spread. She can get those lazy louts who've been coasting on their gender for good knows how many years. She can declare a potluck. She can make it an after-dinner gathering and assign everyone a snack to bring.  \n\n>I\u2019m new to this whole boundaries thing. It was hard enough for me to confront Mom at all, and my plan was just to put my foot down and insist that I\u2019ll come for dinner but not hour early. Wasn\u2019t planning on saying I won\u2019t come at all, even though Mom told me not to. I know she didn\u2019t mean it, but I\u2019m bitter about it anyway. Thanksgiving is over a week ago so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll call me before then, but I really think I\u2019m going to skip this year. Work has been rough, I had a bad breakup, I\u2019m recovering from an injury\u2026 I just want to stay home and relax by myself.\n\nGood news - you did excellently at this boundaries thing! You told your mom what your boundaries are you stood firm against her attempts to emotionally manipulate you, and her \"counter demands\" (which aren't things she gets), and when she tried to flip the script on you by \"uninviting\" you, you remained calm and just said \"okay\". \n\nYou're tired, you need a break, your love should not be measured by how much of yourself you expend in labour for your family embark at the, particularly when others aren't weighed the same! If she calls, tell her that you've already made alternate plans after she uninvited you. She doesn't need to know that those plans are \"jack shit\"!\n\nTell her that you can both try again next year, but that you're tired of being tired for the holidays and you don't want her relying on you for that much work anymore. If she doesn't want to do the work either then her choice is to enforce her \"no\" - she does not get to demand other people's \"yes\".\n\nHappy - restful! - holidays!", "nahh ur NTA sometimes you have to stand up for yourself", "NTA and I would definitely not go.
