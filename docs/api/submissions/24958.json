No matter how slim, there is always a chance of surgical complications, reactions to anaesthetic, even mortality (from a skim I believe it's around 0.07% of donors?).\n\nEven if the surgery goes completely as planned, you will also experience a not insignificant decrease in kidney function, which puts you at risk for more complications as you get older.\n\nDecisions like this about health are never clear cut and it's up to you whether you're willing to bear the risk.", "NTA. That's an absolutely massive decision that could have major effects on you for your entire life. It is wonderful when someone is willing/able to donate a kidney for a loved one but being uncomfortable with that ask does not mean you don't love her enough nor make you an asshole. \n\nSorry you're both going through this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you can pretend to agree, tell the doctor you do not want to do it, than it will go down as \"did not work out\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr you can just tell her NO, you are not her spare part container.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: **The problem is that kidney failures often are caused by heredity factors (family background) - sou if your sister has kindey issues, it is not unreasonable that at some point you will have some, too.** So: Unless your sister's kindey failure was caused by a mechanical accident, you should be cvery careful - her having a kindey failure increases the chance that you will have problems, too - and will need all the kindneys you have to survive long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.kidney.org/transplantation/livingdonors/long-term-risks](https://www.kidney.org/transplantation/livingdonors/long-term-risks)", "NTA as it is your body and your decision, that has to be respected.

I dont know your circumstances though so i cannot judge. But man, what a heavy load to bear.", "nta - everybody would like to imagine that in that position they themselves would donate but honestly it\u2019s a HUGE decision that will affect you for the rest of your life. i totally understand feeling guilty especially with familial pressure and ties but at the end of the day it\u2019s up to you and what you think is best for yourself - doesn\u2019t change whether you love your family or not !", "NTA. It's a deeply personal decision. If it helps, I donated a kidney to a sibling MANY years ago and have had no problems so far (knocking on wood \ud83d\ude09). There are times when I think if I never accomplished anything else in my life, I did that and am so grateful to have had the chance to uniquely help someone I love dearly. I'm sorry you're having such a dilemma and are under so much pressure. I'm also very sorry for your sister. I wish you peace with whatever you decide.", "NTA.

EVER.", "This is a Jodi Picoult book.", "NTA, it\u2019s your body part and while you can live with one you also only have one.\n\nIf there is  any issues down the road medically (which if your sisters condition is hereditary there might be) you will need that kidney.\n\nPeople can live on dialysis for DECADES. Does it suck? Yes but she gets to stay alive. \n\nShe can also go on the transplant waiting list and it\u2019s not off the table in the future.\n\nUnless there are reasons for why her kidneys are failing and that would make her ineligible for the transplant list. In that case I would have second thoughts about doing the transplant because she could also not change lifestyle factors and blow through that one as well.", "NTA. It's your body and you're within your right to consent.\nBut OP,  just as you would need to be prepared to live with the consequences of donating a kidney if you chose to do so, you need to face the consequences of not doing that as well.", "Have you actually been tested to be a donor or is that assumption based on shared blood type? \n\nWhy do you think you'll be sick afterward?", "NAH.\n\nOrgan donation is based on the ideas of informed consent and bodily autonomy. You have the rights to your own body as well as to any choices made regarding healthcare decisions, especially when it comes to serious ones like this. This makes no difference even if it means someone else's life depends upon your choices because it is *YOUR CHOICE*. This would be true for organ donation or even just blood donation.\n\nIt is however possible that you sister is an asshole based upon her reaction to your choice not to donate to her and calling you, but I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt since it's likely frustration at her situation. Your reasoning in the bot post makes it seem like she can be put on the donor list too so she has a chance to get a kidney via that method too (I don't know how long of a wait she is looking at via that method though). \n\nYou are not the asshole here. They are not the asshole here. No person is the asshole here. If anything is the asshole here it is biology for screwing over your sister for giving her a defective kidney and that's all.", "This is made up. No transplant program would tell anyone anything about you unless you were 100% on board with a transplant.", "NAH. You aren't obligated to go under the knife and put yourself at risk for another person. That being said, the other person is your sister, and she will likely die if she does not receive a transplant. Being that you're the only match, you may be her only chance to survive.\n\nAnd if you're concerned about long-time symptoms or pain after your donation, the majority of people who donate kidneys do not have long-term side effects from their surgery. It is possible, but not likely. Generally, your remaining kidney will grow in size to compensate for the missing one, and you will continue to live a healthy life. And single kidney donors tend to outlive non-donors!", "If you weren't going to donate, why did you get tested?", "It's your body and no one has a right to any part of it. However, your sister seems to be very ill. I can't imagine being in this situation. I have no judgment because of that.", "NTA That being said can you take being shunned by your family? It's your parts and you have to make that decision. I don't think your family will ever let that go if she dies because she did not get the kidney.

It's hard for everyone.", "INFO: what changed between you getting tested to see if you were a match and now? \n\nI don't understand why you'd get tested if you were so opposed to it, so I'm assuming something major happened in between to make you change your mind.  If not, YTA for giving her hope when you had no intention of donating.", "Really is difficult.  My sister received a kidney from her daughter, my niece. Ii think it is the most selfless thing you can do, and I totally respect it.   I'm 53, my only son 24, I just couldn't do it  wether his choice or mine.  His life is more important to me than mine.", "On refusing the act alone NTA. \n\nOn the broader dynamics as to whether you are an asshole for not potentially helping your sister and how the family feels about it, a lot more information is needed about you, her and both your relative health risks around this procedure (which is not a small surgery) and beyond.", "More information needed here;\n\nDo you have a good relationship with your sister?\n\nCan you tell us why not?\n\nI know people that have donated a kidney and they weren\u2019t sick after doing so, they needed to recover.

Your sister will _die_ if you won't. I guess you really need to decide if you're okay if she dies. Me personally I would not want to give my kidney to anyone, I faint when I get my blood drawn. I won't be one of those amazing people you see written about that donates to a total stranger.\n\nBut if it was someone I cared about, like my sister- yeah better get me a spotter for the time being but bye kidney.

Its your right to refuse but most people function fine with one kidney do youactually  know the risks involved because it sounds like you don;t.", "NAH but don't be surprised if your family cuts you off. Just as you have a right to decide whether you undergo an operation, they have a right to decide if they wanna consider you family moving onwards. I'm certain your sister at the very least will have written you off. \n\nThere's no right decisions here so if you've weighed everything up and decided something, go with it.", "NTA but I wouldn't want to know you.", "Your body, your choice. But your choices will have consequences, eg : your sister will likely get sicker and die. I dont understand why you got tested if you weren't going to donate.  And fyi you can live a long happy live with 1 kidney.", "From an individualist perspective NTA - your body, your choice.\n\nFrom a family stand point YTA - your sister could very well die from something that could have been easily avoided through some sacrifice.", "INFO: what happens to your sister if she doesn't get the transplant?", "INFO\n\nYou are entitled to do whatever you want with your body, nobody can force you to do it if you don't want to.  But why do you not want to? Is concern for your health your only reason? Do you have a bad relationship with your sister? Is she going to die if you do not donate? Are you aware that most ppl can live a completely normal life after a kidney donation?", "So there are 2 sides to this.\n\nYour body, your choice.  You don't HAVE to give up an organ for anyone  All of that is true, so in the most basic sense, no you are not wrong for making the choice that is best for you.\n\nThat said, yeah, YTA.  You can live with one kidney.  If you were a woman who was planning to have kids, that might be a concern to only have 1.  But you'll most likely be fine.   You are willing to stand by and let your sister die because you think you might get sick.  Again, chances are you'll be fine after a couple of months.\n\nSo I guess put it this way, you are well within your right to refuse.  And when your sister dies (even before then actually) every member of your family is well within their rights to decide you are a bad person and want nothing to do with you.\n\nYour choice, but there WILL be consequences if you choose not to.", "YTA. Save your sister\u2019s life. How could you even live with yourself if you don\u2019t?", "If your sister has been a decent sibling to you then YTA. You're literally going to let her die. Gone forever because you didn't want to deal with some discomfort. You obviously have no legal obligation to help you but you have a pretty clear moral one IMO. And there's a decent chance your family won't speak to you again if that happens and understandably so. \n\nIf she's been a really bad sister then NTA, I don't think familial obligations persist no matter how they treat you, but your family still probably won't ever forgive this.", "Yes, YTA. Unequivocally. You might as well outright kill her. \n\nIs it your right to keep the kidney? Yes, but that\u2019s not what you asked. You asked if you were the asshole. YTA so much I\u2019d be ashamed if we were even distantly related. I have a hard time believing someone as selfish as you even exists.\n\nIf the role was reversed you would absolutely expect your sister to save you. You\u2019d be groveling on the floor, begging, crying, in hysterics pleading for her to have an ounce of basic human dignity and give you the chance at life. \n\nIf you allow your sister to die the repercussions in your life will likely be profound. I expect your other family will blame you. They will absolutely resent you, and likely it\u2019ll be so deep it\u2019ll turn into hate. Everyone will have seen you as who you\u2019ve chosen to be; a parasite. You took love and kindness from the world, and when it mattered you gave nothing back. Everyone will know you\u2019re not a safe person to love or trust, because you\u2019ve already shown them that when it matters, you chose yourself. Also, expect future partners to leave if they find out.", "I don't really know how to phrase my view properly so I'll just say NAH/NTA.", "Kinda dude.   She's your sister and she'll die without one.", "YTA. Your sister will die. It will not be a short or easy death. It will be long and drawn out, and she will suffer. You only need one kidney.

On the other hand, it is your body; and therefore your choice so you have every right to make your own decision. Even so, it still makes you an AH. Ask yourself this: if she dies, will you regret your decision not to donate your kidney?", "Why would you get tested if you would later decline to donate?\n\n\"Needs a donor soon because her health is declining\" suggests that she will die without your kidney. You aren't ethically obligated to donate, but imo you aren't acting morally.
