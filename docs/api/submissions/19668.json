{"id": 19668, "submission_id": "149c8x5", "title": "AITA For Not Allowing Alcohol at my Wedding?", "selftext": "I (25F) am getting married May of next year. I\u2019m currently planning the reception and I have already secured a venue. I was having a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they\u2019ve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we\u2019d be serving. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, fruit-punch, and soda available.\n\nMy aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it\u2019s so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and fruit-punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we\u2019re planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We\u2019d also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they\u2019re welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn\u2019t be a request. I told her I simply didn\u2019t want to serve any at my wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible for their actions. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn\u2019t be a party without one. I said no, again, because it\u2019s my wedding and fianc\u00e9 and I would feel responsible for drunk guests. We also want to have a wedding that\u2019s fun and happy because everyone there loves each other and is happy to celebrate their family/our union.\n\nShe said it was already a shame I wasn\u2019t getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can\u2019t go one evening without drinking then maybe she\u2019s the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don\u2019t appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave. They ended up going, but then my aunt complained the next day on Facebook about my \u201cdry wedding\u201d and said she wasn\u2019t going to torture herself driving an hour and a half to my venue just to have a bad time. She also explained how the conversation went the day before and said I called her a drunk for being healthy. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of messages, some supportive, some on the fence, and some very angry that I want to \u201cruin a good reception by acting like it\u2019s the prohibition era\u201d. I\u2019m honestly confused here, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: my aunt\u2019s health comment wasn\u2019t about beer, it was about wine. She believes a glass a day is important for maintaining health and she drinks at least one glass every single day. She\u2019s also hopped on the intermittent fasting trend, so I take her \u201chealth advice\u201d with a grain of salt. Especially since she probably meets the medical threshold for alcoholism. \n\nAlso, another reason I don\u2019t want alcohol is because this is a specifically kid friendly event. I want my little cousins and nieces/nephews and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s younger family members to be able to attend. I don\u2019t feel comfortable hosting an all-ages event with lots of alcohol and drunk adults present. A lot of my family members do not behave when they\u2019re drunk.\n\nEDIT 2: For those saying I should make the \u201cdry\u201d part clear in advance, I planned on having the entire food and drink situation for the wedding figured out and announced six months before the date. I wasn\u2019t going to spring it on people last minute. Everyone was going to be informed and then further reminded on the Save-The-Date\u2019s and the invites! I\u2019m also not anti-alcohol or something. I like drinking, there are just too many concerning factors and liabilities with allowing it at my wedding, including the incredibly expensive cost of providing the alcohol.\n\nEdit 3: To everyone suggesting a cash bar, that would invariably make this situation worse. My relatives expect me to provide alcohol for free. If I tell them they have to pay they will complain more. One of my uncles was arrested last year because the price of his favorite brand of beer went up and he stole his next 12-pack because \u201che deserved it after how much money he gave to that company\u201d. He still thinks the cops and the store were in the wrong.\n\nEdit 4: Very tired of people not reading or simply ignoring what I\u2019ve already made clear and twisting my words. I\u2019ve explained my case. Most of you agree with me. I am done responding to comments and explaining/answering questions.", "created_utc": 1686760051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c8x5/aita_for_not_allowing_alcohol_at_my_wedding/", "score": 1130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I DJ'd quite a few over the years.\n\nBut you need to understand something.  You need to make sure it is spelled out on the save the dates and/or the invitations that this is an alcohol free wedding\n\nAnd this is why\n\nMore than once, I DJ'd a dry wedding where the bride and groom said nothing.\n\nOnce people ended up at the reception and realized it was dry, the vast majority ate some food and then left...leaving the bride and groom hurt that they paid all this money for just a handful of people to stick around at the party\n\nA lot of people, especially parents and busy people...go to weddings because they are big parties.  And when you are busy with work and kids and living life...it can be hard to carve out some time to let loose and get drunk.  And yes, a lot of people work hard and play hard.  That doesn't make them bad people, it just means that when they do have free time, they want to have as much fun as they can...which usually involves alcohol.\n\nSo when these people find out there is no alcohol after having not been told there is no alcohol...then get irrationally angry and they bail.\n\nOne wedding I DJ'd...I found out after the fact that the bulk of the people who left all ended up at the same bar down the road.  So here you have the wedding party happening at a local bar...while the bride and groom were trying to enjoy their mostly empty reception hall\n\nThat is why it is important to make sure people know the wedding will be dry.  Because at least then you can save money and have a smaller reception at a smaller venue with smaller food budgets.\n\nThat way you save money and you won't have to feel bad when people bail on you.  You'll already know its going to be a small affair so you can just enjoy yourselves\n\nNTA but understand...there is a right way and a wrong way to go about doing this.", "So you are totally within your rights to have no alcohol at a wedding. But weddings are long, have definite periods of boredom, people get grouped with people they don\u2019t know, and the guests have an hour and a half drive there and back. So there is definitely a risk of a wedding that isn\u2019t very lively and that people leave early from. Alcohol fuels the party and encourages breaking the ice with strangers. Even for the people that don\u2019t drink or are the dd the party is still enhanced by the vibe. I would probably at least provide a couple of bottles of wine or champagne per table just so people could loosen up a little.\n\nBut NTA it\u2019s your wedding you get to choose what you want it to be like", "NTA for not having alcohol as long as you don't get mad if some people won't attend the reception.

YOU do YOU and have a great wedding.", "You're NTA because it's your day, but I'd be prepared for people to leave early if there's no alcohol being served.", "Nta - but you need to accept if people no longer want to come to your reception.

If you need alcohol to feel fun, maybe the problem is really alcohol.", "NAH...in terms of her expressing her opinion about the alcohol (the church comment sucks), as long as you make it VERY clear to people in advance that there is no alcohol.\n\n\nThis is a common theme both on this subreddit and r/weddingplanning and the general consensus is that it's rude to have a dry wedding and not let people know in advance. And I don't drink at all, so this isn't about my personal preference. \n\n\nThere are people who plan on drinking. They might make arrangements like taking a cab or getting a hotel because they want to drink. That's a lot of money when they don't need to.\n\n\nAnd I know there is the idea of \"if they really care about me, they don't need alcohol to enjoy themselves,\" but people think differently. It's an invitation, not a summons. Your closest friends and family will probably be there anyway, but there are people who won't enjoy it. People who might not know as many people and don't feel comfortable mingling with strangers without drinking a little. People who won't dance without drinking a little.

Sure, but at the end of the day you're going to celebrate people and whatever the couple decides to do. \n\nMaybe have a morning wedding/reception, since it's generally socially unacceptable to drink that early.

You get to say what goes. I personally don\u2019t think mixing children and alcohol is a canon offense; nor do I think fully grown adults who can\u2019t handle their liquor are your responsibility. However, this is your wedding and if you don\u2019t want it, you don\u2019t have to have it.\n\nI will say that, as your aunt has exemplified, there will be plenty of guests that will disagree with your policy and try to argue with you about it. Be prepared for some you\u2019re not as close to to skip the event altogether. People are really connected to alcohol and it\u2019s deeply engrained in a lot of cultural events, e.g. weddings. While having a dry wedding is completely valid, it will definitely ruffle some feathers.", "NTA - but don't be surprised if people don't attend/leave early", "Tell people. Make sure they know.

Sure, maybe the way it is worded can hint at a possible drinking problem on her side, but if she claims the only way to have a good wedding reception is by drinking, I think there is indeed a problem here, not necessarily alcoholism but how could someone not have fun and be happy for a family member being married?", "If you want a wedding without alcohol that's fine. It's your call.\n\nI'll admit, for whatever reasons, weddings don't tend to be as much fun without alcohol. But that's probably cuz I'm not a party person. I'd rather be reading a book or playing a board game than a party. So my general position is make it clear in advance that there won't be alcohol and that if people try to sneak alcohol in, they will be escorted out. (Explain that your venue will fine you if people consume alcohol that they don't provide. I imagine that is actually in your contract with them so it won't be a lie. And give a couple of friends or cousins that you and your fiance trust that task.)\n\nThis has 2 benefits: (1) no one can claim they didn't know about the alcohol and (2) save you money on the guests who don't want to be there because there isn't alcohol.\n\nNTA", "NTA...\n\nThe day belongs to you and your fiance.

Do I think you'll have the fun happy wedding you envision without alcohol? No, you will not.\n\nIf you are in the US the expectation for weddings is that there will be alcohol provided for your guests in some form. Alcohol is always offered at nice restaurants, part of holiday celebrations, corporate events, even offered at upscale salons and spas. We associate alcohol with luxury and hospitality. If a wedding is something you throw for your guests, (you are creating this party to celebrate with friends and family, right?), EVERYONE's expectation will be that you are providing the elements of a celebration, including alcohol.\n\nYou mention cost and fear of  drunk guests as reasons not to include alcohol. There are ways to mitigate both of these concerns. You can limit what's provided to beer and wine only (which you buy on your own), or to a specialty cocktail. You can provide a limited number of drink tickets. You can limit the hours during your reception that alcohol is served, say only during a cocktail hour, only during dinner, or to be cut-off at a certain point, like an hour and a half before the reception ends. You can limit alcohol to a cash bar.\n\nBut what you can expect from a dry wedding is a similar vibe to other parties that do not include alcohol. This will be akin to a church basement wedding with punch and cake, a teen's birthday party, school events at the high school. No one will dance, people will leave early, your RSVPs will be cut in half.\n\nI am saying this to you as someone who does not drink-- this is not the way to go for your personal wedding. Please focus more on providing a great party for your loved ones, rather than your fear over their drinking habits. It is just a sad reality that people will skip your event or leave early if alcohol is not provided. And you don't deserve that.", "YTA, enjoy your empty wedding.", "ESH. You for what you said to your aunt. Look, you can have a dry wedding if that's what you want. But put it on the invitations so that people know and can decide whether or not they want to attend.  Plenty of people want to drink and unwind at a wedding, that doesn't mean they have a drinking problem.

I\u2019m currently planning the reception and I have already secured a venue. I was having a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they\u2019ve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we\u2019d be serving. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, fruit-punch, and soda available.\n\nMy aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it\u2019s so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and fruit-punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we\u2019re planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We\u2019d also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they\u2019re welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn\u2019t be a request. I told her I simply didn\u2019t want to serve any at my wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible for their actions. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn\u2019t be a party without one. I said no, again, because it\u2019s my wedding and fianc\u00e9 and I would feel responsible for drunk guests. We also want to have a wedding that\u2019s fun and happy because everyone there loves each other and is happy to celebrate their family/our union.\n\nShe said it was already a shame I wasn\u2019t getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can\u2019t go one evening without drinking then maybe she\u2019s the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don\u2019t appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave.

I\u2019m kind of the ESH boat here because while I think the aunt went about this in a ridiculous way (the conversation about health from both sides over one night of soda and or wine options is just absolutely ridiculous and besides the point), the OP also sucks here for implying that the aunt had a problem because she couldn\u2019t go \u201cone night\u201d without drinking.

Alcohol as a part of celebration is baked into our culture and most wedding culture. To imply people who are upset or disappointed that it isn\u2019t there have \u201ca problem\u201d is immature and really downplays alcoholism and what alcoholics and their families go through makes OP an AH too in my eyes.\n\nESH because as always with parties, the hosts (bride and groom) can choose to do whatever they want, especially if they are paying for it. The aunt should have never approached the subject the way she did, she should have just chosen to not attend. I agree brides and grooms who choose dry weddings should make that information widely known so people can mentally prepare for that (including declining to attend if they\u2019d like), otherwise the bride and groom are setting themselves and their guests up for disappointment.

People are going to sneak alcohol anyways, so let it not be on you to supply it. Edit : to add, those who might say \u201c if they\u2019re going to do it anyways why not supply it or let them bring their own?\u201d Because it\u2019s their wedding. They get to pick what they want to do and that\u2019s the long and short of it.", "NTA\n\nIts your wedding, sounds as if you and your fiance are footing the bill and know what you can afford, and more importantly know what how tour guests will behave with alcohol on board. \n\nYou're perfectly in your right to have a dry reception and sounds as if your timeline of letting guests know is appropriate as well.", "Let me see\u2026 it\u2019s your and partners wedding, reception, choice, finances, responsibility.

I don\u2019t drink and I was so sick and tired of people who can\u2019t have fun sober.", "NTA and I have never heard of this need to tell people about alcohol availability? \n\nI got married in 2006 and we had a dry wedding. I didn\u2019t want to pay for it and I have tons of alcoholic relatives who would been unmanageable. \n\nI also got married in the afternoon and specifically told the caterer that I was not feeding lunch or dinner. I did refuse to cook food because we had a large guest list. Worked to about $12/person.\n\nNow my sister got married in 2009 and basically took my wedding experience and do it a bit better. She did serve lunch from a fantastic bbq and fried chicken with tea and lemonade. \nShe also had a dry wedding reception but even though this was made clear to her future in-laws they decided to literally tailgate in the parking lot of the church!! \nI wish I was joking. But she also got her food for $8/person.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choices. My wedding was dry, and nobody cared or objected. Besides, adding booze adds a fortune to the catering bill.", "NTA.

I enjoy a good drink as much as the next person, but do we honestly need to start warning people about dry weddings?? God, people are tedious.", "NTA. Your reasons for a dry wedding are completely valid. \nI don't like alcohol, so I just can't relate with all the people who think fun is synonymous with drinking. Do people really have to disorient themselves in order to be happy at a party? Sounds like they need therapy.", "NTA, as you can plan whatever kind of wedding you would like.\n\nHowever, your guests will expect that alcohol will be served. Your reasons for not allowing alcohol to be served are a bit confusing. You aren't personally responsible for your guests' actions.\n\nThe expense is a real factor, but depending on the venue, you can get a few kegs of beer and a few cases of wine at CostCo and be able to offer those drinks as an option without breaking the bank. And you can always offer a cash bar and give guests the option to buy their own drinks if they really want to.\n\nYour aunt was very rude and has no right to demand that you buy her alcohol. But at the same time, the wedding is not *just* about you but is also about providing a fun party for your guests. (If it was just about you, you could get married by yourself at the courthouse, which of course is an option.) Providing a variety of soft drinks is a good start, but it's not unreasonable or crazy for your guests to expect to be able to have a few drinks at a big party full of music and dancing and celebrating and family reunion.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, have it how you want. \n\nJust make it clear to people and remember it\u2019s their right to not come.", "NTA- It\u2019s your party, you\u2019re paying for it.

As long as the guests know in advance, it\u2019s not a problem.\n\nAnd your aunt is an idiot. Alcohol isn\u2019t healthy. It also contains sugar, and you can\u2019t get drunk from juice! \n\nIf she can\u2019t have fun celebrating your marriage and spending time at a party with family without alcohol then you don\u2019t need her there. She must be a really dull sober person. \n\nNTA", "I think you\u2019re NTA for not having alcohol overall, as long as you make it clear on the invites.\n\nAre you fully opposed to doing a cash bar or anything though?

You and your fianc\u00e9 get to have it done your way\n\nI personally don't drink and love the idea of a giant alcohol-free, kid-friendly wedding. So often, kids can feel left out at weddings because there isn't much to do. \n\nIf you end up with the budget, you get even get some grenadine, fruit juices, and other mixers so people can make up their own mocktails to have even more fun with it. And sparkling cider for the toasts!\n\nThough some guests may sneak their own booze so be aware of that", "Here in England, there is always a bar regardless if there are kids, it's the norm.  It's not usually a free bar either.  The wines with the meal & bubbly for the toasts are provided as part of the meal package", "How is she going to \"have a bad time\" without alcohol?

You have reasonable justifications for not having alcohol at your reception and you even planned alternatives with accommodations for people with medical issues, while taking into account your family's behavior when under the influence to ensure a safe time. It's also your wedding and reception, so your aunt can not dictate them. If people really think that the only way to have a good time and enjoy themselves is with alcohol, then yes, there's definitely something wrong with them.", "Last time I checked alcohol wasnt healthy either NTA", "NTA \n\nI was on the fence at fist, but then read your edit concerning bad drunks in the family. So NTA for that reason alone. As a Ukrainian, I'm quite biased in favor of as much alcohol as possible at a wedding, since to me, it's definitely not a party if people aren't drunk. But that's only the case because everyone I know is a responsible drunk. My dad and his two best friends can easily kill a case of scotch between them during a wedding. It's happened. Neither one of them would dream of driving in that state, and they know their limits.", "NTA since it\u2019s your wedding. But having never had a wedding could y\u2019all not have a bar that guests have to pay for their alcohol at? The only thing I disagree with is how you said you\u2019d feel responsible. They\u2019re adults and are ultimately responsible for their own actions", "NTA. But Still be prepared for people to drink before or bring their own without telling you & hiding drinking it. I don't drink any more, but honestly that's what I would do. I'm not trying to get black out drunk but having a handful for sure.", "NTA.\n\nI am not even going to read anything more than the title. Anyone who gets offended by a dry wedding is either an asshole or an alcoholic.", "NTA.  Ya don\u2019t need to pay for people to get drunk, and I do mean \u201cpay\u201d both financially & for any trouble they get into while drunk.  I mean, if they can\u2019t be responsible & go a night without drinking, they\u2019re probably not gonna be responsible drinkers either.", "I take issue with the fact that the hosts feel they need to \"feel responsible\" for their guests' alcohol consumption. I've been happily drinking for over 3 decades. I don't need anyone to be responsible for my intake - I know my own boundaries - and I imagine many, if not all, of their guests would feel similar. \n\nOP doesn't say where they are located. But in the UK/Canada/Australia it's a cultural norm to have alcohol at weddings. I believe it's a legal requirement in Ireland (sarcasm). Understand you are proposing going against this norm and that guests may not share your positivity for sobriety. \n\nIf this is a budget issue, which I believe it really is, fair enough. Alcohol is expensive. Perhaps consider a cash bar instead. \n\nSoft-NTA, your wedding, your rules, but don't be surprised to find the real party happening at the bar down the road/in the hotel halfway through the evening.", "Not going to lie...

If I were invited I would absolutely sneak in at least one flask. \n\nAlso, you sound *extremely* judgemental of others.

Do you expect everyone who drinks to be sloppy and drive drunk?   Perhaps a little more trust in them to behave like you'd like them to, or I suspect YTA", "NTA.

One glass of wine a day is not even remotely \"alcoholic\". My grandmother lived to 95 having one glass a day. I rarely drink alcohol personally, but your comments strike me as a bit harsh.

It just sounds like you're trying to parent people a bit.  Also, you were TA to your aunt.", "yup, this; at least make it very clear from the get-go. on posts like these, there are usually some comments that are like \u201cwell if your guests can\u2019t go a single day without booze, maybe theyre just alcoholics\u201d but the fact is that weddings kind of suck if you\u2019re not the one getting married or aren\u2019t super close to the people getting married. Most of the time, I would honestly rather go to a funeral because at least they\u2019re shorter a lot of the time. The reason a lot of people look forward to a wedding is because it\u2019s a good excuse to hire a babysitter so they can get funky and party.

My sister had a dry wedding, not by choice. My, now brother in law's parents, don't drink and paid for the reception. My (our) parent's paid for the wedding as is apparently traditional. The fact that the reception was dry was not told to anyone until everyone showed up at the venue. \n\nMost of us live in Wisconsin, which for anyone familiar will understand would be problematic for a dry reception. The celebration was dying fast after dinner and toasts so my Dad gave me and a couple of my Uncles a wad of bills and told us to go and buy as many coolers and beers as we could. \n\nWe went to Walmart got a couple tarps to line the trunk of my Uncle's car, bought a ton of ice, and spent the rest on beer. We pulled up in the back alley from the venue and opened a side door. The reception was saved and there weren't any major incidents.\n\nThat story aside.\n\nI understand having a dry wedding and I am glad OP is making it known beforehand. But understand that folks might dip out for a taste or two during the celebration. The whole ceremony is for the couple being wed but most see it as a party, often to see family that they haven't seen in ages. It is a time to drink, be merry, and rejoice...or at least that is how I feel. Kids might be present but that will be the most opportune time to mess with Uncle Larry and get him to pay each kid 5 bucks for all those birthday's he missed.\n\nVerdict: NTA", "I\u2019ve been to a dry wedding. It didn\u2019t clear out, but people kept sneaking off to drink in the parking lot.", "Yeah this is kinda where I'm at. \n\nThe couple can do whatever they want, and I think the aunt is really off base in a bunch of ways (especially demanding that there be alcohol to \"make up\" for the lack of a church wedding and some of her nonsense reasons). But at the end of the day, weddings, for a LOT of people, are basically social obligations a lot of the time, particularly when you either a) don't really know the couple that well or b) don't really know most of the guests well or at all. And they're often boring. Insanely boring. Trying to make small talk with complete strangers or relatives you see once every five years isn't that fun, and neither is listening to endless speeches or sitting around at cocktail hour with nothing to do.\n\nAlcohol at least allows people to unwind a bit, maybe even loosen up socially so that the small talk comes a little more easily. I'm really not a heavy drinker, but if I go to a wedding, I kind of expect there's going to be some booze and that it will help make the night go down a little better. \n\nYou can do what you want with your own wedding, but you also have to understand that you're asking people to attend a big expensive party (often, expensive for the guests as well given travel, clothing, etc.) that is all about YOU, and that part of doing that is making an effort to show them a good time. At least set the expectations so that people can make an informed choice.", "I had this exact scenario play out at a friend's wedding. It was never announced or made clear that it was a dry wedding/reception until I sat down at the table all us HS buddies were assigned to and a friend leaned over and whispered \"there's no alcohol anywhere, I think this is a dry wedding!\" We did end up staying for a couple hours, ate, danced, and tried to have fun, but by 8pm the place was starting to clear out. We helped the bride pack up what was left of the food (it was a byo potluck) and did some quick friend group pictures before we also left the venue and walked to the closest bar down the street. When about a dozen of us walked in dressed all fancy the bartender asked where we came from and we told him of the dry reception. He immediately pulled out a pitcher and said \"Well then, first pitcher is 50% off.

It's your wedding and you can do it your way.

They know they make more tips when alcohol is served and are not opposed to defying brides to make an extra buck. I love the idea of meeting afterward at a bar. I was a bridesmaid in a wedding where it was a cash bar, except for the bridal party. And we only got two drinks.

Many people are sober almost entirely and may only drink at a wedding or when they see family. If you don't want to drink that's fine but I think it's way over to the top to judge others for this.

Some people need a little lubricant to dance, particularly if they did not come with a partner. It is difficult to converse with other non-dancers because you have to talk over music. So, a bunch of people are sitting around watching other people dance and unable to have a conversation, scrolling through their phones in uncomfortable seats. \n\nBasically, alcohol is the easy way out for your party.
