As well as all the disposables. \n\nWhen we asked what she was going to provide she said 3 of them were pitching in to have some brisket made (as they don't know how to make it themselves) while another family was bringing two sides. Mind you, some of the family members had offered to bring other dishes, but Maria turned them down because she wanted \"authentic\" Thanksgiving dishes and not the Mexican dishes we usually have. \n\nWhile me and my mom have previously made all of these dishes for Thanksgiving, it has never been these many at once. I would have no issue if it was only a couple of things, however, when I brought it up to her Maria said she had already cut down her wishlist since I was already cutting her off when she began listing food earlier in the call. \n\nHer attitude about this has really put me off and I'm beginning to not want to attend and advise my parents to not go either. However maybe what she's asking for is not actually unreasonable and we should just do it.\n\nHere's where I think I could be the asshole; this is one of maybe the 2-3 times we go and see extended family. My dad is very fond of his side of the family (so the people who are in attendance) and this would stop him from interacting with them. Also, what is everyone supposed to eat if we don't go? Not everyone should have to suffer because the host decided not to make any food and Maria has already told everyone in attendance we would be taking care of it.

You're unable to make all the food, but you could make *some* of those items.

Cut Maria out of the communication loop and contact your other relatives to tell them Maria is expecting y'all to bring more food than your capable of. Then divide up the menu between the (hopefully) sane members of your family.

Sure, that's fair.\n\nHaving a \"wish list\" and giving an attitude about it? That's overboard. I'd say to determine what feels reasonable to bring and let her know that's what you can provide. She wanted to host, she can figure the rest out.", "NTA\n\nWTAF, your aunt wanted to host but she wants you and your mother to cook ALL the food, other than a brisket.  No WAY would I agree to that.\n\nI host Thanksgiving, I cook all week for it.  My guests bring a dish also, we eat, and all have tons to take home for leftovers (nothing ever wasted, my immediate family is huge).  I would NEVER ask one of my guests to bring the bulk of the food AND the paper plates and such.  That is completely InSaNe and entitled.  Even if I decided to cut back this year and only make the turkey and dressing and cranberry sauce, ask each family to bring a big side...one big side.\n\nJust tell the aunt, no we will not do that.  We will bring one side like the others, she can cook, she is the host.  Don't avoid going, just don't cook everything.

This ask is way too much and even if you agreed, you\u2019d be setting yourself up for failure.  Tell her that.", " NTA. The tradition is the host provides the main dish aka the turkey. She\u2019s using y\u2019all as free labor and taking all the credit. Don\u2019t go and cancel.", "I think your aunt is definitely asking a lot from you and your mom. I think you should make it clear that you can only bring a couple of the items from the list. Communicate it to the rest of the family to see if anybody else volunteer to bring another food item. \n\nHaving said that, I think YWBTA if you keep your family from attending Thanksgiving, which is what you are asking in your actual title, I think you should try to have a reasonable conversation first before you ruin thanksgiving for your mom.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation or responsibility to any of them.

Believe me, they already know how she is, so it'll be no surprise.   My family was like that, expecting me or my mom to always cook.  After a while, we stopped.  The only explanation was a firm, I'm sorry, but no.  After a while, they did it themselves.   Were we cut out of occasions? Yes.  Did we mind?  No.  I learned (through the family grapevine) that since they couldn't \"use\" us for food, why bother.  That was a small segment. The family who loved us for us are the ones we cherish.
