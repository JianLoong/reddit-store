That\u2019s a lot of nerve to expect anyone to bro g but yet she takes all the credit for hosting.     \n\nDo your own Thanksgiving your way at your house and invite only immediate family that you really want there\u2026 or none at all!", "\u201cHi aunt.  I will bring this dish and this side.  I hope you can find volunteers for the other items.  I look forward to seeing everyone\u201d  ESH", "NTA- but contact the extended family and say 'sorry for the misinformation: Maria didn't actually ask us if we'd be willing to supply 90% of the food before telling you we would be doing it- we, like the rest of you, had assumed that as she begged to host, she would be the one providing the majority of the food, especially after she turned down multiple people's offers to bring some dishes'", "If she is paying for brisket she can have a Turkey delivered! NTA!", "Why can't your parents go without you?\n\nAnd who calls themself a host and demands the guests bring all the food?", "Just have it catered by Costco or Cash Saver or WinCo or whatever grocery store will literally cook the entire meal for you.\n\nBut make it quick, they need those orders in Asap so they can plan accordingly.\n\nWe've only done that once but it turned out really great and easy. Huge time saver.", "NTA - the reason why the host does the big hot meats & main parts of the meals is to prevent food spoilage, and hence food poisoning. If you cook it & keep it warm while traveling to your Aunts house, it\u2019s still going to need to be re-heated \ud83e\udd74 that\u2019s going to make everything dry & tasteless. \n\nRun with that as your platform!", "NTA. If you are okay with it you could compromise by volunteering to make whatever you want to make. \u201cI can\u2019t bring that much but I\u2019ll bring the stuffing and green bean casserole.\u201d Or whatever. It\u2019s up to her to accept that or decline. She shouldn\u2019t have asked to host if she didn\u2019t want to host?", "Also tell dad that he needs to stand up for you and your mom because if his relationship an asshole like your aunt who wants to use you and your mother for free labor than you are gonna be rethinking whether or not you're gonna want him in your life.", "It takes a good few hours to make a decent apple pie. There's no way I'd be able to do everything else too.", "Yellow is basically Mac and cheese but with spaghetti pasta instead. Green is made with poblano peppers in a cream sauce, would highly recommend", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But fair point", "If dad wants to go so much,he can make all that food. Green spaghetti, yellow spaghetti, purple spaghetti, all of it.", "And would one pie serve everyone???  Why isn\u2019t everyone asked to bring ONE dish???  You can\u2019t say you\u2019ll host then not do anything and expect someone else to pick up your slack.  NTA.", "Make Dad handle his sister. It's his family, his circus and monkeys.", "> I do not have the contact information for everyone who will be in attendance,\n\nDo you not have *any* of these people's contact info?\n\n> She will likely throw shade at us the entire evening and make comments\n\nType up bingo cards in advance. Whoever fills theirs first wins movie tickets.\n\nLike, her cutting words won't *actually* cut you, and you don't even like her. So... be relentlessly cheerful, laugh or make an agreeable comment to everything she says, pretend like you don't care a bit.\n\nI promise you, there is nothing more infuriating to the Marias of the world than to know that the target of their ire thinks they're a big joke. And the angrier they get that their arrows won't hit, the funnier it all is!", "Not your problem. Tell her as the host she is responsible for the turkey and main dishes. You will provide a side or two. Be prepared to address this with others who come.", "Change the subject.  Cooking the turkey and ham and then transporting it is asking to give everyone food poisoning.  She needs to make those.  Buy the apple pie, make the spaghetti, and skip the sweet potato casarole because no one likes it and only has some because they think they have to.", "Your dad should have contact information for all these family members and should be able to communicate with them. In any case, he is the one who needs to manage his sister.\n\nHe needs to have a heart to heart with her. That she cannot use you and your mom as all of the labor for a gathering she begged to host. (And she won't even cover the cost of disposables!) All three of you will attend, bringing only the green spaghetti, yellow spaghetti, and one other side. No main dishes, no disposables. Those are her responsibility to make/purchase and her problem to figure out.\n\nIf she tries to insist that you all are responsible for everything, then he can tell his sister that none of you will be attending the meal. He (or you three) will stop by later. (He can bring a dessert to be a good guest.)\n\nHe can enjoy his relatives and speak up on your behalf if his sister tries to shade you/your mom. Neither you nor your mom have to cave to your aunt's crazy expectations.", "Do your parents have contact information?", "When she throws shade, you throw chanclas.", "Watch me somehow make purple spaghetti and show up out of spite", "Even better idea! And once there he needs to call out the aunt for being lazy by trying to force his wife and daughter to do most of the work despite the fact that SHE was the one who BEGGED to be the one hosting!", "NTA but what is green and yellow spaghetti?", "Hm. Maybe a sauce made with purple sweet potato puree? You can make a sauce with pumpkin or butternut squash instead of tomato, I'm thinking something like that.", "If you used a white sauce like Alfredo you could easily add food dye, just saying.", "I previously replied to someone asking the same question but I'll say it again because I truly love these recipes. Green spaghetti is basically spaghetti with a poblano cremy sauce (I'm sure there's plenty of recipes online). And yellow is kinda of a cheesy pimento spaghetti. Both super good in my opinion but not we commonly make outside of potlucks or get togethers.", "Nah I\u2019d straight up boil plain noodles with food coloring and call it a day to be petty", "Those both sound really, really good...but how are those \"authentic\" Thanksgiving dishes?\n\nYour Tia Maria is a few tamales short of a meal...\n\ud83e\udd23", "Now I REALLY want green spaghetti. Creamy poblano pasta sounds divine.", "Okay that sounds absolutely delicious, but I would never expect that for a Thanksgiving dinner.", "Part of me is tempted to say they're so good not even they passed her standards"]}
