But no one really liked this one cousin, Leo. He was an extremely bratty kid and he was spoiled beyond belief. No one liked him. When he reached a certain age\u2026 13? he just stopped showing up to family gatherings even though his parents and little sister always came. \n\nLeo and I are 19 now. All the cousins involved in this are 18-22 years old. \n\nNow, my mom told me that Leo went through something traumatic. She asked if I\u2019d be willing to spend some time with him as my aunt and uncle don\u2019t really know who Leo\u2019s friends are and the therapist/doctor is encouraging Leo to hang out with people. \n\nI refused at first but eventually accepted. My mom never asks me to do things like this so I figured that this was a big deal. \n\nand it is because Leo isn\u2019t Leo. He\u2019s this whole other person and I feel so bad for him. It\u2019s like trying to hang out with a child but in a sad way, not like a \u201che\u2019s so childish\u201d way. I decided to keep hanging out with him. He usually just sits there while I talk his ear off or we paint together but it\u2019s become a part of my routine. According to my aunt, he looks forward to our hang outs.\n\nAnyways, my birthday was coming up and I decided I wanted to do something with Leo this year. I brought this up to my other cousins and they immediately went fuck no. They started telling me that it\u2019s my choice to \u201cbabysit a grown man\u201d but it isn\u2019t theirs. I insisted that he wouldn\u2019t be a bother as we\u2019d just be watching a movie at my house but they were upset with that too because they wanted to party with drinks and all that. \n\nI told them as the birthday girl, I should be allowed to do whatever I want on my birthday. They said \u201csure but we don\u2019t have to like it\u201d so I told them not to come then. They said fine.\n\nWell it\u2019s the day of my birthday, my aunt dropped Leo and his sister off at my house and we were getting ready for the movie when a few of my cousins rang the bell all dressed up saying that they booked something idek what. I told them I had plans and they got pissed off saying that there is no way I\u2019m actually going to ditch them for fucking Leo. They were extremely hurt, brought up stuff Leo did/said to us when we were younger then called me a backstabbing bitch before leaving.\n\nI get it, I really do. But I genuinely assumed they didn\u2019t gaf abt my birthday after our argument and I thought I made my wishes pretty clear. I can understand the feeling of betrayal I suppose, but Leo\u2019s older now. It isn\u2019t fair to hold all those things against him, especially with all that he\u2019s going through.

It's your birthday, and you communicated excellently.\n\nYour cousins sound like they moved on from being bullied to becoming the bullies.", "NTA - You told them what you wanted, you told them if they didn't want to hang out with Leo they didn't have to come along, and yet they STILL went and made secret plans WITHOUT your input, and showed up expecting you to ditch your current plans for them.\n\nThey are acting like entitled asshats... I get that they don't like him, but FFS people do sometimes change, especially given what Leo has apparently been through.", "NTA your cousins seem to be the ones who need to grow up", "NTA. That's not say that whatever person feelings they have about him or the way he treated them are invalid, but you very clearly communicated your plans and wishes for your birthday, so it's pretty gross and trashy of them to lash out at you for not abandoning him so that they could make you do what they wanted to anyway. You did nothing wrong and I hope that, when you're all in a headspace to do so, you will sit them down and discuss with them how wildly inappropriate it was of them to pull what they did. Hold them accountable.", "NTA, your cousins need to grow up and just deal with it. They had nothing planned with you, and you had nothing planned with them: They can\u2019t be mad because you want to spend YOUR birthday with people you chose and doing things you want to do. They need a reality check lmao.", "I\u2019m not sure if English is your first language or your family is melodramatic, but this is in no way, shape or form, a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d NTA.", "First, your cousins are a piece of work to be so vulgar and straight to calling you vulgar names if you don't behave the way they want. This doesn't make them any better than the 'old' Leo. Good for you for seeing beyond Leo's past and accepting him for who he is now and being a good cousin to him. Also, good for you for standing up for what it is that you wanted to do versus what other people believe you should want to do. Your other cousins are too immature. A person can be friends with whomever they please, it doesn't betray anyone. If they can't handle being around him, then that's their choice - not your betrayal.", "NTA.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I get that kids can say outlandishly cruel things, and not everything deserves to be forgiven or forgotten, especially if no apology was given. However, everyone involved here is old enough to know how to have empathy. Obviously whatever traumatic event Leo was involved with was so serious it caused a massive personality shift. That doesn\u2019t happen with trivial things. Your other cousins should understand that people can change.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It takes a big person to forgive someone for what they did as kid.

I told them days before that I have something in mind and plan on following through with or without them. They said fine. What was I supposed to think?

I don\u2019t really see it as a betrayal either but they\u2019re seeing this as me choosing the bully cousin over my best friends since the womb so in a way, I get why they think I\u2019m betraying them.", "It seems like your cousins have become what Leo used to be. Your a mature person by forgiving someone who wronged especially when both of you were children. From how your  cousins are acting it looks like Leo and you are going to grow apart from the rest of your other cousins.", "Your NTA but be prepared to have lower contact/not talk to them at all.

Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t stop hanging out with Leo even if I wanted to as that would be extremely cruel to him. I love them but my healthy, mentally well cousins will be fine without me.", "All I can say is you do you. I would love to be a fly on that wall at thanksgiving tho.", "Fair enough lmao", "NTA.  You are a good cousin and friend to Leo.  I\u2019d just like to give an honourable mention you your mum, who really knew what she was doing when she asked you to spend time with him.  \n\nIt must be nice that she knows you so well.  And kudos to you for realising she wouldn\u2019t have asked you if it wasn\u2019t important.\n\nYour other cousins are AH but they are young and sound immature.  All you can do is keep doing what you\u2019re doing and hopefully, one day, they\u2019ll think \u201cX is still hanging out with Leo, maybe it\u2019s wort giving him a chance?\u201d", "end he a brat or was he a bully? I mean he was a kid, and if he was a bully, that honestly does suck. But I feel like he's obviously gotten more than his share of karma apparently. No one deserves to be traumatized to that level. The fact they aren't even trying to empathize is sad. This happened to him when he was 13 right? If they dont want to hang out with him, that is there right, but they shouldn't be opposed to you hanging out with him. They could've still made bday plans with you for another time the same day."]}
