She doesn\u2019t see it this way right now. But in time, it will become clear how much damage is done when you raise children to not be conscious of others around them. You\u2019re actually being a good friend. Well done.", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to be blunt with people. Hopefully, your friend will take some time to reflect on your words and change her ways before she fucks up all the kids with her blatant favouritism.", "NTA.\n\nWe could hope this would finally be a wake up call for Leah to start parenting her child right because, after all, it\u2019s not just her last born that she wants to love and coddle - it\u2019s a boy who\u2019s going to have to grow up and learn to be able to live independently and productively. BUT unfortunately it most likely will just be her calling everyone else assholes and saying she did nothing wrong because she knows how to parent her kid, yadda yadda. \n\nYou did the right thing letting her know what everyone else was too scared to tell her. I\u2019m sorry that you might\u2019ve lost your friendship this way but at least you won\u2019t have that interruption at next thanksgiving.", "NTA you are much kinder than I am. I would have told her to load up her little hellion and GTFOH. This child is getting no discipline (Home Training in Southernese), and this family is going to find themselves unwelcome pretty much everywhere soon if not already.", "NTA- Narcissism is a personality disorder, but if he's prone to having NPD from birth, then she's definitely not doing him, or her other children, or anyone else any favors by being passive, or even encouraging his bad behavior.  What she should be doing is seeking out a psychologist to narrow down why he's being violent with other children, and why he's behaving this way at a dinner.  A genetic predisposition isn't her fault, but how she handles it absolutely is.\n\nIt is also important to note: NPD can be brought on by environmental factors as well, but not always from the same type of environment.  A lot of the times, neglect and emotional abuse can bring about NPD (which may not be the case with Leah towards Max), but an overly amount of adoration that is disproportionate to his experiences *may* be a factor as well.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Max will develop NPD, Leah is undoubtably TA for not raising him better, and even more so for emotionally neglecting her other kids, which can definitely have long-term harm on them if she doesn't do better as a mother.", "NTA. As host, it ws your responsibility to control the mood.  And youmexplained why when confronted with falsehood. More power to Ya. You may have lost a friend, but thats not always a bad thing.", "NTA. In the long run, you\u2019re doing both him and her (not to mention the rest of the family) a favor by being honest.", "NTA..sounds like the brat needs a shock collar. Good on you.", "Oh, you won\u2019t bring your spoiled little budding narcissist kid back? Don\u2019t threaten me with a good time, Leah. \n\nNTA, OP. Dinner sounded much nicer for everybody else, after she took him and left.", "NTA But this is why psychology is weird and dishonest. People are begrudged and labeled as \u201cnarcissists\u201d but told all their adult lives to do what\u2019s best for them. Damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. So It\u2019s hypocritical and inconsistent.\n\nI\u2019d say the child needs to learn humility and how to serve others. Which is oddly enough a biblical principle.", "NTA. \n\nHe would be *solidly* corrected in my family.", "NTA.", "Especially when said kid isn't a \"cute little kid being funny\" anymore,\nBut a full-on teenager/young adult. \nAnd his behaviour turns towards her with all the \"I'm big I know best\" attitude of a teen. \nOr when he can't get the new iPhone and trash his room/the house? \nHe already is beating up kids and bragging about it. \nHow will she defend herself against a tantrum throwing and raging 16 year old? \nOr when he's old enough that police will be involved when he assaults someone? \nOr the other way around, he tries to jump the wrong person and gets the ass beating instead? \n\nIt is a huge favour to tell someone \"ey. Open your eyes to what you are doing\"", "Narcissism isn't really a trait you can just \"fix\" with a bit of humility though.  We don't know if this kid does or doesn't have Narcissistic personality disorder, but if he did, it can very likely be genetic.\n\nThat's not to say Leah is excused for her poor parenting, but there is actual science behind narcissism, and Leah should be putting her son into therapy if he's becoming violent and displaying behaviors that are abnormal for a 5 y/o without a personality disorder.", "NTA. I have a friend of a friend who raised her first born like this. He is now in his 20\u2019s with many issues. His younger brother was suicidal in his teens because of the neglect and toll it took on him. He is doing great now, but there was a time it was a struggle.", "NTA, and maybe have a private chat with Greg to let him know what you see. He needs to check his wife.", "NTA\n\nShe is definitely raising a little terror.", "NTA I feel bad for the first and second drafts. Those poor kids. Good on you for being honest and bringing it up in a timely and gentle manner.

Just wait till the husband has had enough and divorces her and the older 2 kids want to live with Dad.   \nThat kid will be a terror once he hits school when no one wants to be around him.", "Your friend is the narcissistic personality disorder that you need to shake free.", "NTA: if Leah understands what you are saying and changes her ways, then that's good for everyone, especially the older siblings. If not, then at least she's out of your life and Max won't ruin any more gatherings.\n\nInfo: are the older siblings both girls?", "NTA, 5 bucks says he will be fired the first day if he ever gets a job.", "[this is what your friend is creating]\n\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/AH2hF3ecZs)", "NTA. I\u2019m in a similar situation with a child on my husband\u2019s side of the family. I\u2019m not going to go into specifics but the kids parents aren\u2019t fit. So, this kid has been \u201craised\u201d by people that shouldn\u2019t have to. Problem is, they don\u2019t hold this kid accountable for anything. He screams if he doesn\u2019t get his way, and throws things. He\u2019s an absolute menace. On Thanksgiving they tried to make my son play with him before we were allowed to leave,  after my son repeatedly told him no. This kid doesn\u2019t get told no, and they think everyone should bend to him like they do.", "NTA\n\nLeah is going to be told this from multiple sources as soon Max goes to nursery school, onwards. Teachers and schoolmates will not tolerate this.\n\nLeah may run out of options if Max gets himself repeatedly expelled. \n\nShe may be unable to keep babysitters, too.", "Everyone should have taken a turn giving that brat a walk, 23 people , 23 miles Max walked that night!", "NTA that child is being done a disservice. I went to some rough schools and eventually a kid like that got their ass beat by other kids who couldn\u2019t put up with it anymore. Max will have to learn how to function in society. I guess maybe not if he turns out to be some NEET but even then, that\u2019s risky because the parents might not always be around.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a narcissist, it sounds more like ADHD to me. However, he needs to learn how to deal with frustration and temper. It will get worse because people won\u2019t tolerate that shit and he\u2019ll get more strength and therefore become more destructive.\n\nI say this as a person with ADHD and I can literally feel the pressure building up that this kid must feel. I know it well. I had to learn how to cope with that, too. As a girl, being quiet and complacent was part of girl education since forever anyways.\n\nMom needs to finally take care of child and teach him to deal with his emotions. She\u2019s doing a poor job at catering to his needs! And she\u2019s doing a poor job at being a guest!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Leah is being neglectful towards her children by refusing to teach and discipline the youngest. The older two don't deserve to be terrorised and the dad doesn't deserve to be ignored constantly when it comes to parenting decisions. She needs to get her act together before Greg has had enough and it ends up in divorce, but at least the older two wouldn't be being treated like 2nd class citizens in their own home.", "Well the bonus is she and Max won't be back.\n\nThis is horrible parenting. It's entirely your friend's fault but she is creating a monster and her other children are going to hate this child. What sort of mother openly tells one child he is the favourite? \n\nHis over-indulgence will lead to nothing but problems for him when he realises he is not the centre of everyone else's universe. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You told her the hard truth. With luck, she will check around with other friends, hear the same kind of things and realize she has to make some changes. She is not doing her baby boy any favors indulging his intolerable behavior, or inflicting it on others. (It may serve as some cathartic outlet for her, but that's a whole other show.) At the very least, you won't have to put up with the little monster anymore.", "Nope.... even if it end the friendship- it needed to be said. \n\nOthers need to repeat this. \n\nI am worried for Max - he will suffer as a result of her ignorance\n\nNTA", "i work with children a lot and other than his mother encouraging that behavior it\u2019s pretty normal for an annoying 5 year old but it will definitely fester if his mom doesn\u2019t check herself", "NTA, you did 100% the right thing.", "NTA (though explaining that she was also harming her older children too seemed to be missed out and would have been worth clarifying as it seems no one else has pointed it out).", "NTA. If you can handle the drama, please keep inviting Greg and the other kids. Give them a break and a chance to experience normative human socialization.", "sadly see this type of parenting all the time, last child born will get all the attention especially if the other children are much older, No matter what the child does there will always be an excuse, mothering a child to much will just raise a self entitled little brat and may possibly end up hurting others more severely when much older, just like the mothers whos kids are in jail and they say - my child is a good child he done nothing wrong -", "You're much nicer and more polite than a lot of people would have been. NTA", "Honestly best outcome she won\u2019t come back lol. NTA what so ever", "My brother was brought up by parents who believed the baby boy was so much better than my sister and me. He never had to do chores so basically grew up as an idle entitled useless idiot. This is how things have remained. My sister and I have jobs and mortgages and have raised nice educated children with good men. My brother is now back at home, aged 53, unemployed, unemployable and doesn't even ask my parents of they want some rent paid!! The level of entitlement is beyond human understanding.\n\nIF OP does not speak to the father of this brat and point out whats going to go wrong and this is his chance to raise a good kid or a brat then take up your sisters \"threat\" of not seeing them again.", "NTA\n\nIf Max is straight I fear for any women in his path because he is likely to be at best an abuser and at worst a criminal (and we all know what kind of criminal that won't take no).

She's raising a brat, not a narcissist. I'll take my downvotes like a man, I'm just sick of the internet stripping psychological terminology of its meaning.", "[removed]", "It's understandable that dealing with Max's behavior was challenging, but expressing your concerns about him potentially becoming a narcissist in a blunt manner during a holiday gathering may have been too direct and hurtful.", "Ah yes and her favorite last baby boy will be demanding a new car and expensive stuff and making it impossible for her to retire when he is 30 and she will then be wondering where things went so wrong.", "> it\u2019s a boy who\u2019s going to have to grow up and learn to be able to live independently and productively\n\nNo he won't. We see these favorite child \"men\" in here on a regular basis, with mom's apron strings still wrapped around their neck, sometimes by choice sometimes not.", "Dinner sounded much nicer for everyone else including Greg and the two older kids.", "Meta moment: I want to like your comment, but I'm a Satanist and it's at 666. #dilemma", "Dude, he was proudly bragging about beating up his teammate. He probably already doesn't have any friends.

He knows way better than me or any outsider for that matter what's going on.", "The amount of and type of attention Max gets definitely helps confirm the idea that everyone has at some point, and most grown out of, that he is the main character.", "From what I recall researching, while it\u2019s unclear why people develop NPD, it\u2019s generally considered that a mother\u2019s emotional neglect or over affection can either contribute.", "You're right. The way Max is behaving right now, really, truly thinking people MUST thank for his existence, is awfully concerning. This could be the start of a NPD, even though Personnality disorders usually starts in teenhood. \n\nAnd the two other kids... I don't understand how a mother can behave like this, hurting her children, giving them the impression of not being enough. What's in Leah's mind ? She needs helps too, there is something off with her preffering Max so much. \n\nI agree with the fact Max needs a therapist asap, because this isn't a thing parents will be able to handle. And I hope Greg will succeed in making her wife see more clearly but... won't it end in a divorce instead ?", "Which wife? You know that his mom would think that none of them are \u2018good enough\u2019", "The oldest is a boy, the middle one is a girl.", "They already went through 4 Babysitters and an Au-Pair that left after two months. According to Leah they were all unqualified and lazy. One of our friends tried to tell her that the common denominator in this was them quitting because of Max's behavior. It didn't go over well.", "I actually think the best option right now is divorce or at least separation. Then Greg can give them an environment in which they're equal and can start redirecting Max without fucking over the oldest two, at least for two weeks out of each month.", "First of all- absolutely love your handle. Second I don't know if that's still normal. I work in pediatrics and rarely ever met a kid that out of control. The aggression and violence towards other kids and especially his siblings (who are not allowed to defend themselves) is heartbreaking and sometimes outright dangerous. Last Christmas he smashed a glass Christmas ornament into his sister's face because she wouldn't give her presents up to him. She spent Christmas in the ER and now has scars on her cheeks.", "Doing what's best for yourself isn't narcissism. That's self interest which is usually good, but most people know when to put it aside for a greater goal. Narcissism goes beyond that into: I'm going to do what I feel like (regardless of self interest) and make everyone else's life hell if I can't.", "You need to open a separate publication for your AITA.

Come back and upvote if you want.", "Yep.", "Sounds like he belongs in a cage now.", "I suspect that, rather than overstepping, you may be throwing him a lifeline. Rather than specifically telling him he needs to check his wife, reach out and say \"I see the reality you are living with, and I feel for you and your older kids\" and give him a safe place to unload. Sometimes, simply being seen is a gift, and I don't think Leah sees anything but her youngest.", "Yes, you\u2019re right. And you don\u2019t need to tell him how to check upon his wife and kids but you can tell him that Leah and Max won\u2019t be invited anymore if they can\u2019t do anything without this drama.\n\nHe\u2019ll get the hint that you\u2019re being serious now and won\u2019t tolerate this anymore.

She's gonna be mad? Well she's already mad, might as well throw max a bone and tell him the normalcy in his household is gone.", "Yeah, this would definitely be overstepping. But I think it would be fine for you to say that Max isn't welcome at your house anymore.", "Even if it's not full-blown NPD, dealing with someone who has narcissistic tendencies is never fun. Leah's creating a monster with the way she's treating her child. Whether or not he's diagnosable, he's awful and it's impacting the rest of Leah's family and her other relationships, and that's worrisome.", "I'm sure you didn't mean anything by it, but while I don't know specifically what contributes to personality disorders, I would say caregiver rather than mother.", "Absolutely. The child will grow up to be messed up if something doesn\u2019t change.", "Oy vey.", "It\u2019s 2023 and we\u2019re in a place worse than the dark ages with the compulsive assumption that everything is genetic.

The same goes for most personality disorders.  The only reason I bring up the genetic factor is because you can't just undo a personality disorder with discipline.", "I honestly don't know.", "Honestly, it might be time for an intervention. Probably not for Leah I don't think she will listen, but for Greg. Leah is harming all three of her children. He's the only one in a position to stop her.", "NTA, but you all need to sit Greg down and explain how much hurt this is causing on his kids, he needs to take a more proactive approach at the situation, and if Leah won't stop, he needs to provide an environment for all three of them that will encourage them to grow into emotionally healthy and empathetic young adults. \n\nIt's been years, this will damage the relationship between everyone if somebody doesn't stop Leah, and he's the only one who can.", "This this! Please support Greg he sounds like he could stand to have support and tools against his torrential mompour of a wife", "NTA.  I have a sister no one in the family ever talks to because, as the baby of the family, our parents let her decide EVERYTHING!  Want to go on a picnic?  Nope, she wants to go to the zoo.  Horseback riding?  Forget it, she wants a boat ride.  Chinese for dinner?  Nope, she wants burgers.  Dad would smile at Mom and say \"We saved the best for last\" constantly.  She became a spoiled brat that bawled to our parents, at the age of 17, because our sister chose her best friend as her MOH over her and it wasn't right!  \n\nYou may be the first to tell her that she is raising an entitled, obnoxious human, but you won't be the last.

And those are not characteristics you can sweep under the rug forever, not if you\u2019re a person who prizes respect and compassion in the people close to you. \n\nNTA, but it\u2019s time to think hard about whether or not this is a friendship worth saving. She\u2019s making it quite clear that she\u2019s uninterested in any sort of negative feedback on her behavior, and her silence is a strong indication that she\u2019d rather sacrifice her friendships than take any sort of criticism to heart.", "He's 5. he categorically cannot have NPD.", "NTA.

My mother did this with my youngest brother, and as a youth coach, I saw this type of parenting all the time.
