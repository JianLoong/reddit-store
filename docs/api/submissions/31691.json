The two older ones are very pleasant to be around and overall what you would call \"good kids\". Then there is Max (5 m). He terrorizes his sister and brother, needs attention 24/7 and Leah encourages it. She calls him \"her favourite last baby boy\". Whatever he does to anyone she brushes off with \"I just can't be mad at my favorite last baby boy\".  She says things like that in front of the older ones and you would have to be blind not to see how much it hurts them. I've been watching this whole situation for the last two years and never said a word because I don't believe in policing other people's parenting and I think it's Greg's job to check her on that. He tries but failed so far. Along comes Thanksgiving. We had 23 guests including Leah's family. We were all sitting at the table and Max started yelling every time the attention of the whole table wasn't on him. And I don't mean talking loud I mean just screaming at the top of his lungs. He wanted everyone to watch him dance, then listen to the story of him beating the shit out of a kid at soccer practice, then playing with and throwing around food, then cried when people ignored his demand everyone should say they are thankful for him being cute like his mommy when we said what we were thankful for this year. I first looked at Leah and Greg to make sure they understood I wasn't cool with that. He tried to shut him down but Leah encouraged him and told him how funny and cute he was. Other people tried to gently shut him down and have conversations until my husband then got more specific and told him he can either let the other people eat and talk in peace or go and eat with the other kids at the kids table where he was supposed to be in the first place. Leah looked super pissed and went with him to the kids table. I was relieved and thought that was the end of it. She left fairly early with him but the rest of the family stayed and everyone seemed happy. \nThis morning I got a call from Leah. She told me we were horrible hosts and this would be the last time they would come for Thanksgiving. Just to clarify: She actually is a successful, smart and fun person I love. But that kind of broke the camel's back. I put on my nurse voice and calmly told her that I can't be a good host just to Max and she has to understand that her encouraging his behaviors is not helping him but raising him to be either a person nobody likes or even worse a narcissist. She hung up and I haven't tried calling her back. My husband says I did the right thing and just said what everyone in the friend group has been thinking for years but I feel bad for being so direct.

She doesn\u2019t see it this way right now. But in time, it will become clear how much damage is done when you raise children to not be conscious of others around them. You\u2019re actually being a good friend. Well done.", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to be blunt with people. Hopefully, your friend will take some time to reflect on your words and change her ways before she fucks up all the kids with her blatant favouritism.", "NTA.\n\nWe could hope this would finally be a wake up call for Leah to start parenting her child right because, after all, it\u2019s not just her last born that she wants to love and coddle - it\u2019s a boy who\u2019s going to have to grow up and learn to be able to live independently and productively. BUT unfortunately it most likely will just be her calling everyone else assholes and saying she did nothing wrong because she knows how to parent her kid, yadda yadda. \n\nYou did the right thing letting her know what everyone else was too scared to tell her. I\u2019m sorry that you might\u2019ve lost your friendship this way but at least you won\u2019t have that interruption at next thanksgiving.", "NTA you are much kinder than I am. I would have told her to load up her little hellion and GTFOH. This child is getting no discipline (Home Training in Southernese), and this family is going to find themselves unwelcome pretty much everywhere soon if not already.", "NTA- Narcissism is a personality disorder, but if he's prone to having NPD from birth, then she's definitely not doing him, or her other children, or anyone else any favors by being passive, or even encouraging his bad behavior.  What she should be doing is seeking out a psychologist to narrow down why he's being violent with other children, and why he's behaving this way at a dinner.  A genetic predisposition isn't her fault, but how she handles it absolutely is.\n\nIt is also important to note: NPD can be brought on by environmental factors as well, but not always from the same type of environment.  A lot of the times, neglect and emotional abuse can bring about NPD (which may not be the case with Leah towards Max), but an overly amount of adoration that is disproportionate to his experiences *may* be a factor as well.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Max will develop NPD, Leah is undoubtably TA for not raising him better, and even more so for emotionally neglecting her other kids, which can definitely have long-term harm on them if she doesn't do better as a mother.", "NTA. As host, it ws your responsibility to control the mood.  And youmexplained why when confronted with falsehood. More power to Ya. You may have lost a friend, but thats not always a bad thing.", "NTA. In the long run, you\u2019re doing both him and her (not to mention the rest of the family) a favor by being honest.", "NTA..sounds like the brat needs a shock collar. Good on you.", "Oh, you won\u2019t bring your spoiled little budding narcissist kid back? Don\u2019t threaten me with a good time, Leah. \n\nNTA, OP. Dinner sounded much nicer for everybody else, after she took him and left.", "NTA But this is why psychology is weird and dishonest. People are begrudged and labeled as \u201cnarcissists\u201d but told all their adult lives to do what\u2019s best for them. Damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. So It\u2019s hypocritical and inconsistent.\n\nI\u2019d say the child needs to learn humility and how to serve others. Which is oddly enough a biblical principle.", "NTA. \n\nHe would be *solidly* corrected in my family.", "NTA.", "Especially when said kid isn't a \"cute little kid being funny\" anymore,\nBut a full-on teenager/young adult. \nAnd his behaviour turns towards her with all the \"I'm big I know best\" attitude of a teen. \nOr when he can't get the new iPhone and trash his room/the house? \nHe already is beating up kids and bragging about it. \nHow will she defend herself against a tantrum throwing and raging 16 year old? \nOr when he's old enough that police will be involved when he assaults someone? \nOr the other way around, he tries to jump the wrong person and gets the ass beating instead? \n\nIt is a huge favour to tell someone \"ey. Open your eyes to what you are doing\"", "Narcissism isn't really a trait you can just \"fix\" with a bit of humility though.  We don't know if this kid does or doesn't have Narcissistic personality disorder, but if he did, it can very likely be genetic.\n\nThat's not to say Leah is excused for her poor parenting, but there is actual science behind narcissism, and Leah should be putting her son into therapy if he's becoming violent and displaying behaviors that are abnormal for a 5 y/o without a personality disorder."]}
