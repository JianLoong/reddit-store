Also, your mom is using you as the backup plan knowing something will happen to her eventually... but what is the backup plan if something happens to you? (which it could... we're all mortal.)

If not, you will likely come to resent your siblings in the future, when you end up having to care for them and you will have to sacrifice even more in order to do so.\nChange career, state, spend time with only your wife, make plans together. You need to live you own life before sacrificing to take care of your siblings. \nIt\u2019s great that you are willing to have them move with you in the future.

As the adults in that situation, they should have allowed you to be a child. Instead they have you supporting the household and planning to care for your siblings for the rest of your life.

Your mom should have never asked you to agree to taking care of them forever when you were too young to know what you were actually agreeing to.

Your mother needs to reach out to Community Resources and figure out the situation for her child care and their long-term well-being on her own. If you want to be a small part of that, then whatever you want to actually give, as opposed to have stolen from you, is up to you. It is not and never has been your obligation to be the family caretaker. You have a right to a life and family of your own and you need to claim it immediately.

Most likely it would fall upon your wife to do the care taking and would this be fair to her.  She may willing quit work to become a SAHM and that in itself (taking care of household chores while caring for child/ren) is hard and stressful enough but then to throw in her having to be a caretaker to your two adult siblings, may just push her to the edge.
