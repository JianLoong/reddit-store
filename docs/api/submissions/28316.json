Not giving in to such an unreasonable demand is the only way to get management to finally realise they need to fix their staffing problems.", "It was more than just asking a question, that's fine.

We will be on our honeymoon although we aren't leaving town we do have plans to go to events, spend time with friends and family, etc", "I'm so confused. Why did she schedule her vacation at this time when you had already scheduled your vacation time long before that? Like, why? If I work in a small team and I am told we can't have more than one person at a time be on vacation and I am looking for when to book my own holiday, I will obviously avoid the days on which a coworker has already booked their time off, assuming you all have some kind of scheduling tool/calendar.\n\nAnd no offense, but this sounds like you have a typical/average kind of job and you are being asked to work a routine shift because someone else feels their going-away holiday plans double-booked 3 months in advance somehow trump your staying-in honeymoon time that was booked a year in advance. This isn't a neurosurgeon once in a lifestyle \"I'm going to separate the brain of conjoined twins and it can't be done any other day\" kind of thing.\n\nBased on the fact your boss refuses to deal with understaffing, I would insist on keeping your time off. Even if someone ends up 'being sick' on those days. Your boss is making her problem your problem. If they can't respect your honeymoon time that you booked a year+ in advance, eff them and let them fire you if they can't accept that you want your scheduled holidays. I bet they have no legal grounds to fire you over that anyways. And there's always other kitchens you can work at.", "Sounds like your boss doesn't want to solve any of the ongoing staffing issues. None of this is your problem. Lie if you have to. Say that you realise that you will only have a honeymoon once and that you've scheduled all kinds of things for your honeymoon that are paid for in full and can't be cancelled.

Not sure what getting married a few days before has anything to do with anything.", "Still, that is your honeymoon. End of. Time to stop telling these people about your plans for your time off. If you would be happy to fill in for your coworker, then fine, but it should not be an expectation or a demand. Knowing you aren't going away, they are free to ask you ONCE, but if you say 'no', they need to accept that.\n\nYou could offer a trade but be willing to follow through if they say yes: \"Sure, I can work those days to cover for XYX but in exchange I'd like 3 paid time off days for every day of my holiday I will actually be working. So if you ask me to work for 3 days during my honeymoon, I expect 9 days paid time off (fully paid, not half pay or whatever) in exchange.\" But only offer this if you genuinely would accept their 'yes' to this proposal.", "We do, and I told everyone I work with what vacation time I was booking when I booked it a year ago. I also reminded them when I booked it for whenever they asked.", "Honestly, I feel guilty for saying no and being told I'm the reason they can't have their vacation. Our boss is aware that we have a staffing issue as is my coworkers. That's why I'm asking on here. This isn't a fake story. Truthfully, I'm not creative enough to make up stories. Regardless of this, thank you for your opinion. This has made me do some self reflection. Also thank you very much for your explanation.", "Did you read the post they requested time off over a year ago?", "Fair enough, thank you for your opinion.", "OP booked time off a year+ in advance. This is to be on her honeymoon after she gets married. Why do her coworker's holiday plans with her mother that she booked 3 months in advance trump OP's plans? Just because OP isn't leaving town?\n\nThat is a super disrespectful view of someone's scheduled time off.\n\nIt's irrelevant what OP's plans are. Just like when I no longer want to always be the one to cover another co-worker bunking off because their kid is sick, and \"You don't have any kids so you have nowhere to go, you can stay late and lock up, right?!\" There is give and take but it can't always be one person taking and the other person being forced to give. Just because I don't have kids doesn't mean that my evenings and weekends are worth less to me than they mean to people who are parents.\n\nEven if OP had planned her whole vacation time/honeymoon to just sit at home watching movies, that is her prerogative. The manager is free to ask ONCE if she would be willing to work on her honeymoon, but the manager needs to accept a NO. I don't understand how this other coworker booked her holiday with her mother during the same time as OP's holiday when apparently everyone knows they have staffing issues and that it would be an issue with two employees gone at the same time.\n\nIn my team we had shared calendars and we were told that on small accounts we needed to check before we took holidays to make sure we were not gone at the same time as other people on this small account so that customers always had at least one or two people who are actively involved in the project to talk to.", "We're going on a \"honeymoon\" after. We aren't leaving town but we have plans with friends, events were going to, etc.", "Hi, yea you did nothing wrong here. These people are just trying to get as much out of you as they can. I've met people like that. They aren't great to work for.\n\nI just can't understand why someone would have the nerve to try to pressure someone out of their honeymoon holiday time because I'd want to go away with my mum on that same day. Your coworker can find another time to book her holiday.\n\nI'm not saying you should suggest that you would be happy to look for a job elsewhere, but don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Don't let them guilt you into bending over backwards for them or missing out on booked time off with your spouse for your HONEYMOON just so a coworker can go have her time off. People will take what they can get from you. If you go along with guilt tripping etc, they will just see you as weak and that you deserve to be taken advantage of. Say no. Repeat as often as necessary. If they keep asking, be more firm: \"You've already asked me this five times before and my answer is still no. Please do not bring this up again.\" Or just pretend like you are dumb, and say \"You are asking me to work during my honeymoon so that XYZ can go away on a trip with her mother. Why is her trip more important than my honeymoon?\".\n\nIs there HR where you work?", "You\u2019re welcome. \nAnd to be honest i do see why you feel that way but that\u2019s what a honeymoon is for. \n\nMore info : did you request this time off before she did?", "Thank you, there is an HR at my work but it takes forever to get ahold of them that it's honestly not worth it hah.", "I booked it off over a year ago, she requested her vacation 3 months ago.", "That info is in the OP.", "Read the post.", "Sorry about that! But just stick to your time off. Don't let them manipulate you. That person now making passive aggressive comments about not being able to go on holiday now because you won't give up your honeymoon: ignore her. Don't even respond. Don't even look at her. Don't even acknowledge her saying those things. If she forces you into responding, tell her: \"I booked my time off for my honeymoon over a year in advance. The fact you thought that you could take time off at the same time is not my problem and is something you need to take up with the manager. Your plans to go away with your mother do not trump my honeymoon. It is irrelevant whether I am staying in for my honeymoon or am travelling to the other side of the globe. This is my time off for my honeymoon and this is to be respected. You could have checked in with me before you booked to be told that I would not give up my honeymoon so that you could have prevented the need to change your bookings.
