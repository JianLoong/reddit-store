Her dad also cheated a few times and MIL keeps taking him back but it has clearly hurt her self esteem.\n\nAnyway my dad cheated on my mom about two years ago. it was this big dramatic affair, him acting like an idiot claiming he'd never be in love before, and then leaving my mom. He is seriously a different person now, affectionate, he seems to have emotions, it is weird. \n\nMy mom claims she doesn't care. i mean I know on some level he must have hurt her ego, but I don't think she was that hurt or traumatized, certainly nothing close to what my fiancee experienced with her ex. My mom and dad can be in the same room, act civil, and neither seems uncomfortable.\n\nStill my fiancee has a very low opinion of my father and hates the other woman. Note this is strictly about the cheating. She is not at all protective of my mom as they don't even get along. She decided she doesn't want my dad's new wife at the wedding. I agreed as her comfort is my priority.\n\nWe told my dad and he was furious and said he will not be coming. When my mom found out she freaked and said everyone is going to think this came from her and she asked for it. She said we had no right to do that and we made her look like some pathetic scorned ex. I tried to reason with her but she was pissed. She accused my fiancee of being over dramatic and said we had no right to have any opinion on her marriage ending.\n\nMy fiancee got pretty pissed and told her it wasn't her wedding. I did feel bad but said my fiancee's feelings matter much more and she doesn't want this woman at the wedding. My mom stormed off and I feel bad.

If the AP-turned-wife isn't welcome because of a moral objection to cheaters, why are either cheating fathers there? That's either a double standard because she only cares about the people who matter personally to her and not about those who matter to her loved ones. Or she's misogynistic.

You're well within your rights to invite whoever you want and your dad is within his rights to decline an invitation but in the process you 3/4 have fucked over your mum and it's completely understandable for her to be upset since she's the one that has to now deal with the criticism.\n\nI'm curious on why you don't seem to care for your parents though.

Unless you are feeling these things on your own and letting your fianc\u00e9 fall on the sword?\nI would be very cautious about going into a marriage with so much animosity and drama rising in the family.

Your fiance's feelings about adultery are understandable and your sympathy for her is admirable, but you two need to have a long talk, maybe some counseling.

Maybe your mom really is trying to convince people she doesn't care- but I think it's more likely that she's trying to prevent a family conflict that a lot of people would *absolutely* give her crap for.

Having to relive the VERY PUBLIC SHAME, HUMILIATION, SELF DOUBT &, FEELINGS OF BEING COMPLETELY BROKEN, RAW & PARADED ON DISPLAY TO BE JUDGED AND SCRUTINIZED.\n\nAll in front of NOT JUST the friends and family that were there during the actual breakdown of her marriage, who she'd finally been to be able hold her head up around again, BUT whole NEW audience of STRANGERS; \nAll facilitated by someone who has/had NO.

I, unfortunately, had to stumble alone blindly in the dark caverns I had built out of all the unresolved, unrealized anger, pain, shame, trauma and, abandonment issues that I held on to and buried from childhood. I then my adults issues of the same caliber began to pile up on top of what was already bubbling and percolating under the surface; because I never learned healthy, or any for that matter, coping mechanisms until it all manifested into me becoming a bitter and angry person who lashed out at any and everyone for... Reasons.\n\nIt came to a point where I said to myself; \"This is NOT me. I might not know \"who\" I am but I KNOW this is NOT me.\" I did not like that version of me. It sounds cliche, though they are cliches for a reason, but it finally sunk in what the saying \"when you hold on to anger, hate and, bitterness towards someone else the only people that it hurts are those around you and yourself most of all.\" \nI've learned, through my fair share of spirit crushing worthy personal experiences that, though One hears and fully understands the advice/metaphors/help/guidance given to them to aide them/free them/heal them/improve them/their situation... Even when One has the key to \"save\" themselves and REALLY DOES want to save themselves; it will NOT happen UNTIL One is ready Spiritually/Mentally, whatever you want to call it.\nThe determination of each of our points of \"rediness\" is not always something that we have full control over. If it were then, every single,  \"I'm going to be/do/have by x date\" goal that everyone one of us has set at one time or another would be accomplished and this world would be a far different place... \n\nSaying all of that to say,  with professional guidance to help weed through the unresolved trauma littering your fiancee's emotional/mental/Spiritual path and having your love and support OP; Maybe your fiancee will come to realize, more sooner than later, that punishing, lashing out and, being openly hostile & judgemental towards others will NEVER erase the void, anger, hurt and humiliation that she feels inside herself. \nWhether she realizes it or not, she is punishing HERSELF by holding on to and carrying the burden of the terrible thing that was done TO HER... It was NOT. HER. FAULT! \nI'm quite sure she is a very intelligent, a functioning member of society and, on the surface & consciously she knows what her ex did what not her fault.\n\nBUT it seems somewhere deep inside, there lives her self-depreciating self that can't/won't let go of those microscopic slivers of lingering doubt & scrutiny of every. single. thing she might have done or said/didn't do or didn't say but should have that \"made\" her ex so what he did. That flairs up at the most disconnected and seemingly unrelated times the trigger that echo chamber to open up and bellow; \n*it's your fault. It's YOUR fault. IT'S. YOUR. FAULT! You know it was your fault! Admit it! You KNOW you're in denial, if you go back over EVERY. SINGLE. MOMENT. of your relationship, you'll be able to pinpoint the EXACT MOMENT YOU RUINED EVERYTHING! It was YOUR FAULT so you just NEED to CONSTANTLY think about until YOU see what YOU did! You don't deserve to be happy!

She's also sexist.", "I dont think he said that. Saying the fianc\u00e9's feelings matter MOST in THIS case because is her wedding, is not unreasonable. While I agree with the mom that this would embarrass her, is not her wedding and she doesn't get to decide who is or isn't invited. But she would not be wrong if she decides not to go based on that.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a solution. I can\u2019t imagine anything more ridiculous or embarrassing to everyone.", "But her dad is a cheater, and he is included in the wedding. \n\nMaybe have a cheaters section in the back.", "What about her cheating father?", "Totally disagree. If the affair was recent or accompanied by abusive tactics, it is understandable the scorned party would not want to be in the same room. That isn\u2019t an issue with this wedding anyways as someone between the actual bride and groom does not want the cheating couple there as a unit.", "This is pretty important info OP decided to leave out, as always. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI generally don't condone cheating, but this situation sounded like it sucked for both OP's dad AND mom.", "All of the parents are invited, including both of the fathers who cheated. Just not the women they cheated with. \n\nIf one of the Fathers doesn\u2019t want to come without his affair partner/new wife, then that is totally on him and he is solely to blame.", "Both Dads are invited. But the one refuses to come without his new wife who was his affair partner.", "Yeah, right?", "The she I was referring to was the fianc\u00e9e. NOT the momma.", "His dad's still invited just not the AP. Same as her dad. It's only been a couple of years I don't even think it would look like his mum's the one with the issue. I wouldn't want my parents AP at my wedding either especially not after only 2 years.", "Wow. How dramatic. LMAO People who outsource responsibility for their lives don't have happy endings.", "Juicy stuff is always in the comments. \n\nSeems like they basically had an open marriage.  Or at least a don\u2019t ask/don\u2019t tell policy.", "I feel like i didn't mean to respond to you because I would have remembered the lawnmower part. Sorry about that.", "Thank you!!!!! A partner's family needs to be considered as a deal breaker in their relationship. Am I willing to deal with a permanent negative external force constantly interjecting itself into your relationship????", "Happens. :)", "I mean to be fair they didnt uninvite HIS cheating father. They said no to the AP which in Fianc\u00e9e\u2019s case is technically the same seeing as her dads AP isn\u2019t invited either.", "Well that would be your fault for cruelly ASSuming an innocent person is lying when you haven't the slightest clue just because you ASSume the worst in someone like a drama filled toxic person.", "I think she understands family is a different matter. The thing is affair partner is just a rando, she's not family. Kind of the same way you'd invite your shoplifting cousin but you don't want your cousin's shoplifting boyfriend there. \n\nAlso I was kind of addressing the vibe of \"it not any of her business!1!!\" of previous commenters. If they want to treat OP's cheating dad and his affair partner like it has nothing to do with fianc\u00e9e when it does. That happens when you are family. In order to build the rapport to be like, \"hey, I don't want to talk about this but trust me\" you need time and to be vulnerable every now and then. And talking about it how she should just eat it... I don't think they are there yet and its supper weird to demand it.  She has (apparently) already come forward on how it shaped her views and they are \"ours are different and you should not question that\". So they should come forward to, at least a bit, so they can meet in the middle instead of making it all about her.", "From OPs comments, his parents pretty much had an open marriage.\n\nAre you really cheating if the other person doesn\u2019t care who you sleep with?"]}
