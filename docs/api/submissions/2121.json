If the AP-turned-wife isn't welcome because of a moral objection to cheaters, why are either cheating fathers there? That's either a double standard because she only cares about the people who matter personally to her and not about those who matter to her loved ones. Or she's misogynistic.

The fact that they are cheating AHs not withstanding, both dads are presumably people that the bride and groom have some attachment to and positive feelings towards.\n\nThe not-invited affair partner is likely someone who the bride and groom have little/no attachment to or positive feelings towards.\n\nI understand where the mom is coming from, but I'm doubt the guests are spending a lot of time thinking about why the woman who helped OP's father cheat on OP's mother isn't at the wedding. Maybe a few folks will think it was at mom's request, but I'm guessing just as many or more will recognize affair partner is someone the bride/groom wouldn't want there.\n\nAnd frankly, even for the folks who think it's at mom's request... they're not really going to care. This won't be a big thing in their lives or severely impact their relationship with anyone involved. Most people will just think, \"Yeah, that's a mess. I feel bad for mom/OP.\" But they're going to think that whether affair partner is there or not.", "I wonder if this is the fianc\u00e9e's actual goal since she doesn't get along with the mother", "Yeah this. I mean I don't understand fiance, especially since her dad is a cheater and your dad is a cheater. So she just hates the cheater's affair partners?

Sounds like the mom wasn't hurt by it, OP even says that she may have been cheating too but they have no evidence. In either case, it sounds like the mom wasn't affected by this. People have different standards for their relationships and for how exclusive their relationships are. Like, imagine being an adult, making decisions about your marriage and being comfortable with them, to have some petulant child punish you and humiliate you 20 years later because she was hurt by her ex. Furthermore, the dad is marrying the other person- that shows that they honestly cared and continue to care about this person and (presumably) really loves them\n\nYTA, OP. You have some serious unresolved issues with your dad and you're angry about how he treated *you*. Deal with those accordingly, but don't hide behind your gf's misdirected vendetta. YOU don't want that woman in your wedding, and that's OK, you have your reasons. It's evident that you're hurt by the fact that he seems to love this woman yet he was a shitty husband to your mom and a shitty dad to you.

I\u2019ll say it again here, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d marry this woman.", "Yes... but the levels of humiliation are vastly different.\n\nIt's doubtful many people will care/notice if affair partner isn't there. For those who do, many will just assume OP doesn't want her there. A few might think it's at mom's request, but even so, they're not really going to look down on her for that. And they're probably not going to think much about it beyond the wedding day. OP's mom feels embarrassed, but it's unlikely to have much lasting impact on her relationships or peoples' perception of her.\n\nOn the other hand, if the father of the bride--who is still married to the mother of the bride--isn't there, that will stick out like a sore thumb. It will likely be the subject of significant talk and gossip amongst friends and family. It has the potential to drastically alter relationships and change family dynamics for years to come.", "My mom grew up rich, like so rich it is kind of a separate universe and that's just the type of marriage she was used to. They both married the appropriate person, slept in separate rooms, and had nothing to do with each other. I would be absolutely shocked if she never cheated but my fiancee feels like we can't hold her accountable as we have no evidence. My mom also admits that she isn't everyone's cup of tea and doesn't blame him for not wanting to be with her", "I never said anything about her parents. Your dad cheated. Your fiancee hates cheaters. So why is she okay with your dad, the person who cheated, being at the wedding, but not the affair partner (who might not have even been technically cheating).", "Got it, it's ok to shame/humiliate your mom but not hers.   Seriously how can you continue to comment on this and still not see how you and your fiance are AHs?", "Oh cool but your mom gets to manage that?

She should either ban all cheaters (which includes both your fathers) or allow the AP. She doesn't get to pick and chose her trauma on cheating.", "So ultimately she\u2019s punishing your mother for not staying with your father. That\u2019s not the intention but that is the effect here. Her thinking is backwards here.", "So you want to humiliate your parents instead?

Don\u2019t do that. \n\nYTA if you do this, but her even more so.", "Your poor mother, I hope someone had her back.", "So it's okay to embarrass your mother because the two don't get along? But her beliefs can be set aside for her own. Do you not see how she's being a hypocrite? Maybe your mom has a reason not to get along with her..", "Wow, Her father is attending? You\u2019re fianc\u00e9 is huge AH and a hypocrite. Most certainly YTA for enabling her.", "If that is the case, I bet there are other invitations that should be rescinded", "But in other comments OP says that her dad is invited despite also being a cheater.

But I\u2019m pretty sure if her parents were divorced and her father tried to bring his mistress, she\u2019s do the same.

To not embarrass fiancees mother", "Except the men you mean. Since both cheating fathers are invited.", "The cheaters are ok to attend, just not their affair partners.", "Agree. Policing these interactions is going to make more problems down the line, for sure. She's trying to save people that don't need saving. It's a non-issue that's frankly none of her business?", "Agreed, except that OP\u2019s dad won\u2019t attend since his wife is not invited, and that is going to be a big deal.", "Okay, that makes sense. YTA for enabling your partner's behavior. I understand where she's coming from, I understand why it makes sense to back her up, but she needs therapy, not to take her ex out on your dad's partner.", "OP mentioned in the post that his fiancee doesn't like or doesn't get along with his mother.\n\nMakes me think she's trying to make his mother look bad on purpose?", "Ok now what\u2019s her stance on her dad? Or let me guess, he\u2019s paying for an over the top wedding. Which makes it even worse that she\u2019s stepping off her moral high ground for money over cheating", "You know you\u2019re probably like number 3 or 4 on your fianc\u00e9es list for priority for this wedding right?

So her dad could come but not the women he cheated with.", "So because she has a feeling of no control over her own family\u2019s situation, she is exerting that control over OP\u2019s.

The fact that it was unhealthy but not horribly toxic doesn't mean OP needs to be grateful. Parents are morally obligated to provide at least basic financial AND emotional support to their children. If they can't or don't want to do both of those, then they shouldn't have kids.

But in general it makes since to me why someone would invite their cheating parent but not the AP. Your father is your father, a blood relative, probably involved in raising you, basically they actually add some meaning in your life despite having some shitty qualities. People can much easier forgive or look past the shitty things their relatives and friends do. But the AP is just that, some person who wanted to sleep with a married person.

None of that makes her any less of a hypocrite though.", "Omg yes", "Ah ok. Thanks my brain is on sleep mode. :)", "They have no relationship with the affair partners. The cheaters are their blood related fathers who raised them. It makes a lot of sense who they would prefer at their wedding", "Mine is not and I am really glad you got clarification because I was stumped on that autocorrect!", "Yeah, but if the claim is that they hate cheaters, it's their blood relative who is the cheater, not the affair partner. It's hypocritical to invite the cheater who they are related to, while not inviting the affair partner who did not cheat, while claiming the reason to not want them is cheating."]}
