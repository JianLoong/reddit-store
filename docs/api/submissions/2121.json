Her dad also cheated a few times and MIL keeps taking him back but it has clearly hurt her self esteem.\n\nAnyway my dad cheated on my mom about two years ago. it was this big dramatic affair, him acting like an idiot claiming he'd never be in love before, and then leaving my mom. He is seriously a different person now, affectionate, he seems to have emotions, it is weird. \n\nMy mom claims she doesn't care. i mean I know on some level he must have hurt her ego, but I don't think she was that hurt or traumatized, certainly nothing close to what my fiancee experienced with her ex. My mom and dad can be in the same room, act civil, and neither seems uncomfortable.\n\nStill my fiancee has a very low opinion of my father and hates the other woman. Note this is strictly about the cheating. She is not at all protective of my mom as they don't even get along. She decided she doesn't want my dad's new wife at the wedding. I agreed as her comfort is my priority.\n\nWe told my dad and he was furious and said he will not be coming. When my mom found out she freaked and said everyone is going to think this came from her and she asked for it. She said we had no right to do that and we made her look like some pathetic scorned ex. I tried to reason with her but she was pissed. She accused my fiancee of being over dramatic and said we had no right to have any opinion on her marriage ending.\n\nMy fiancee got pretty pissed and told her it wasn't her wedding. I did feel bad but said my fiancee's feelings matter much more and she doesn't want this woman at the wedding. My mom stormed off and I feel bad.

It sounds like your parents marriage was already over, and your mom could care less he met someone, even if it was while they were still technically married.

If the AP-turned-wife isn't welcome because of a moral objection to cheaters, why are either cheating fathers there? That's either a double standard because she only cares about the people who matter personally to her and not about those who matter to her loved ones. Or she's misogynistic.

You're well within your rights to invite whoever you want and your dad is within his rights to decline an invitation but in the process you 3/4 have fucked over your mum and it's completely understandable for her to be upset since she's the one that has to now deal with the criticism.\n\nI'm curious on why you don't seem to care for your parents though.

You need to be your own person with your own thoughts and respect for each others difference of opinions or resentment is sure to follow.  Unless you are feeling these things on your own and letting your fianc\u00e9 fall on the sword?\nI would be very cautious about going into a marriage with so much animosity and drama rising in the family. It will only get harder as your family grows. Kids adds a whole other level of craziness to controlling behavior or in laws/fianc\u00e9 not getting along. Do you want this to be your life?

Your fiance's feelings about adultery are understandable and your sympathy for her is admirable, but you two need to have a long talk, maybe some counseling.
