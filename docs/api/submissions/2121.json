If the AP-turned-wife isn't welcome because of a moral objection to cheaters, why are either cheating fathers there? That's either a double standard because she only cares about the people who matter personally to her and not about those who matter to her loved ones. Or she's misogynistic.

But it's their wedding and I don't think it's unreasonable to want to keep adultery and reminders of it away from their wedding.", "yes but she can't not invite him without humiliating and devastating her mother as they are still marries", "I'm also wondering if she's been to therapy over this trauma. And how would she react if she found out another wedding guest had been a cheater twenty years ago or something? She can certainly look down on cheaters, but messing with the family dynamics of others is not really her business.", "I don't really care. His only role in my life was paying the bills. He really had no role in raising me", "\u201cAnyone who has cheated, raise your right hand!  Okay, now consider yourselves uninvited!\u201d", "Also, is the fianc\u00e9es dad going? Since he\u2019s a cheater too", "I don't care about my dad as he was pretty much a stranger who paid the bills and occasionally had dinner with us to trade snide comments with my mother, and maybe ask me how school was. I do care about my mom but she hasn't been the nicest to my fiancee and my fiancee has to come first", "Seems to me it\u2019s more about the affair partner becoming a wife, than the cheating itself. \n\nExcluding someone because they got married after an affair that no one seems to care too much about, especially the people involved seems wild. I think there has to be more to it. Especially since OP mentioned her father has cheated also. \n\nWhy two sets of rules?", "I agree,  this is totally right.  Op might ask if they are confident in having a relationship with someone who is completely unforgiving. Also,  op needs to prepare to never see father again.  Is that the best solution?", "Found the cheater ^", "It is the dad's wife.", "very few people will say anything to mom about it. Would you really walk over to mom and say \u201cguess you couldn\u2019t even be around them now for your kid\u2019s wedding, huh?\u201d", "But there probably will not be comments directed to OP's mother. Just snide remarks behind her back or unspoken assumptions.", "It\u2019s not her wedding why does she get a say on who\u2019s invited?", "so punish my fiancee by denying her a wedding because my dad can't keep it in his pants?", "OP answered elsewhere that he is because\u2026 wait for it\u2026. She has to in order to not embark her own mother. What a child.", "If that\u2019s the case, then both fathers should be uninvited too. \n\nIn one comment, OP said that not inviting his FIL would humiliate the bride\u2019s mother. So he\u2019s invited. But his mother has said that not inviting the new wife will cause her to feel humiliated because people will assume she is jealous and asked for her to be excluded. \n\nSo why are the feelings of one wronged party given consideration while the feelings of the other are ignored?", "You mean like the father of the fianc\u00e9e?", "But both dads are invited who partook in said adultery...", "Well there's your answer.  Your fiance is projecting all of her anger onto **your** parents because it's easier than deeling with her own family and her own issues.  \n\nWhat she's doing is hypocritical, and deeply unfair - especially to you.  She's put you in an impossible situation and doesn't appear to be considering how that makes **you** feel at all.  That's a serious problem, friend.  Your wife should care about your feelings.", "Dude WTF? \n\nSo you\u2019re okay with your fianc\u00e9e publicly humiliating your mom and leaving her devastated but your fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom has to be protected????\n\nCome on. Your fianc\u00e9e is obsessed with her ex AND she\u2019s a huge hypocrite.", "Ugh, your fianc\u00e9e needs therapy. How incredibly childish.", "So if your parents stayed together, while still cheating, it would be fine for everyone to come?", "So it\u2019s not okay to humiliate your MIL but it is okay to potentially humiliate your mother? That\u2019s an unfair double standard.", "Seriously OP \"yes but she can't not invite him without humiliating and devastating her mother as they are still marries\"\n\nYou need to grow some fucking balls bro. She's fine with her dad cheating, just not your dad even though your parents are fine with it just like hers and you're going along with it. For that you're an asshole. Stop being a pushover. Your girlfriend's gotta get over this it's going to part of your lives as long as you're married which could end. Your family will always be your family. Hope your parents didn't put any money into this wedding.", "Do you hear yourself? It\u2019s almost the same thing she will be doing with your mother.", "Yeah that\u2019s ridiculous. You are being a doormat", "That seems like the much bigger issue", "Paying bills is a role in raising you. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have been raised! You would have starved on the extreme end. That doesn\u2019t make him a great father emotionally but at least he provided for you! I\u2019m a woman btw.", "Lol.   Make a note on \"save the date\" notices......cheaters will not receive an invitation", "so like why not just rescind his invitation altogether?you don\u2019t seem like you particularly care for the guy. nta because im a firm believer in not spending your money and time with people you don\u2019t want to if you don\u2019t have to. pike its your wedding have a blast.", "But your fianc\u00e9e is being totally unreasonable here. Your mom is right, the dissolution of her marriage really isn\u2019t any of y\u2019all\u2019s business and you\u2019re making her look bad.", "Ha! No, just the child of two people who had a complicated relationship and divorce. Life is much better when you choose to process your anger and move forward from a place of love rather than judgement and victimhood.", "Eh, I know my family would in this situation.", "I mean that sucks, but it's really important that the other woman not be present for the bride and groom. And yes, the dad cheated on the mom, but when there are kids involved (even adult ones) he cheated on them too.", "Her dad also couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants but he gets a pass? This is double standards. If she doesn\u2019t want cheaters there her dad shouldn\u2019t be there, your dad shouldn\u2019t be there and you should be asking all of your guests if they or their partner has ever cheated to ensure no cheaters are at the wedding. If she wants to die on this hill which hurts your mum over a woman she doesn\u2019t even know or interacted with instead of blaming your dad for the cheating then let her. You will hurt your relationship with both your parents and only her cheating parents will end up attending, how is this fair?", "Her crusade is injuring the injured party further. Sometimes the principle of the matter isn\u2019t worth the fallout. \n\nLet the affair partner come. Make it clear to her, your dad, and the photographer that she is to be in no family portraits and avoided in candids. Have the ushers seat her and your dad quietly in the parents section before the pomp and circumstance of seating the other parents right before the ceremony. Sit them in the back at the reception. \u201cPunish\u201d her and your dad to their faces, if you think they need consequences, but Jesus, have some compassion for your mom, who has already been humiliated - publicly - once .", "Huh?", "Exactly this. It's not about cheating because if it was, then the 2 cheating men wouldn't have been invited. But instead it's only the female affair partner of one of the cheating men. It's kind of like she might be a scorned woman who had an ex cheat on her with another woman so she wants to take that out on this woman...or something. I get it, it sucks to be cheated on but she's definitely not dealing with that in a healthy way.", "Right? Could've just not invited either of them and saved everyone the trouble", "Seriously? Then your family might be AHs.", "They meant to say embarrass", "No, we just don't talk behind each other's backs.", "We don\u2019t do either - talk behind their back, or attack a mother on their kid\u2019s wedding day. But you do you."]}
