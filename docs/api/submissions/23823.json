I hate driving. My sister (15f) likes going out with her friends, so I have to drive her. She hates seat belts. She scoffs and rolls her eyes and calls me a \"pussy\" because for some reason she thinks she's invincible. She never wears hers, no matter what. There's been times where I won't start the car until she puts it on and she just unbuckles as soon as I start driving. I even pulled over and refused to drive again until she buckled and she took her seatbelt off asap.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was driving her and her friend to the movies. On the way there was something in the road. I don't know what it was because it all happened so fast but it was something big, likely something that fell off of or out of a car. I hit the brakes and changed lanes. My sister went FLYING and slammed into the back of my seat. She wasn't hurt at all and everyone is safe, but I was shaking the rest of the way. When the movie was over I refused to go pick them up and my mom had to.\n\nFor the past two weeks I have refused to drive her anywhere and my parents have supported me in this. She's missed hanging out with her friends multiple times because my parents were busy or just didn't feel like driving.\n\nMy sister LOVES lacrosse, she loves her team, and it's really important to her. She has a super important game Friday morning. My parents cannot drive her and asked me to drive her this Monday, but I told them I will not drive with her in the car. They told my sister that she's responsible for finding her own ride. She said okay.\n\nIt's now Thursday night. The match is coming up and she mentioned me driving her-- I said absolutely NOT! She said I was her ride. I said there's no way in hell! We argued and eventually she cried and begged, promising me she'll wear her seatbelt. She can't find a ride now, she doesn't want to let down her team, etc. I told her if she flew through my front window in a car wreck and ended up in the hospital, she'd REALLY let down her team, but she didn't seem to care then.\n\nShe's absolutely devastated. Her whole team is upset with her, plus her coach. I know she's learned her lesson by now and she'll absolutely buckle, but I'm just so angry with her because the only reason she's listening is because she has something to gain. I just keep saying that this is what it would be like if she had gotten seriously hurt and couldn't play.\n\nMy parents are really upset with me and told me I have to drive her, but they're out of town so they can't do anything. They spend time and money for her lessons and equipment and games-- it's a short drive and I have to suck it up because I can't ruin something so important for her.\n\nWorse, the nervousness has dissipated. I would feel comfortable driving with her because I know she'd buckle, but I'm standing my ground.\n\nWIBTA if I don't take her?", "created_utc": 1691107697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hkk8d/wibta_if_i_purposefully_make_my_sister_miss_an/", "score": 914, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So surely it would make more sense to give her lifts as long as she wears it and if there\u2019s ever a time you give her a lift and she refuses you tell her to get out the car and you refuse the drive?", "YWBTA\n\nYour sister is an absolute idiot, but you say she's learned her lesson, this important and affects other people, and your parents have made this an official task.

The natural consequence of that is missing the game. It's up to you whether you stick to that and force her to suffer that natural consequence, and your parents should be doing that too, not making you responsible for her poor choices. \n\nIf you take her, make it clear that you are doing it under protest, that this is well beyond a sisterly favour, she now owes you big time, and you expect that favour to be repaid.

Her uncomfortable feelings about the consequences of her actions are part of her consequences. \n\nInstead, it seems like they now want to devalue your normal sensible safety boundary, get you to drive her despite her lack of sincere apology or amends, so they don't have to deal with her emotional response.

It would be my fine for driving with a passenger unrestrained not wearing seat belt, and my neck on the line literally. I wouldn\u2019t trust her. I work with people paralysed from car and bike RTAs. \n\nStick to what you said, that she\u2019s never getting a lift again from you (until she has years of proven buckling up every time). \n\nI too pull over the car if someone unbuckles or refuses to buckle up their seat belt. Wouldn\u2019t hesitate to refuse a\nLift in my car for a persistent offender. My providing a lift in my car is a privilege not a right.", "Except you don\u2019t turn the car around and go home. You pull over in to a safe spot and park the car and refuse to drive anywhere until she puts her seatbelt on. Bring a book or something else to entertain yourself with until she complies.", "Her sister dying bc she went through a windshield would be a bigger fall out.", "You said it was a short drive.  So which is it?  Out of the way or not?", "My son is in a team, and he has a teammate whose parents work every second Saturday.  The mate lives fairly close to us, and it's become a habit that we take him to the games on the days that his parents can't.  My son is currently injured and can't play.  We are still attending games, but can't this weekend because my son has a follow up appointment with his surgeon.  The mum of the mate put a call out for help ... and the coach offered to go out of his way, pick up the kid, and take him to the game.\n\nYou are correct.", "From the original post:\n\n>it's a short drive and I have to suck it up because I can't ruin something so important for her.\n\nAnd the comment:\n\n>we live out of the way for most people, it would probably add at least another half hour.\n\nI'm having trouble reconciling these two statements with regard for anyone else picking her up.\n\nI'm **not** saying that Y T A for not taking her, but something seems ... off.", "Why don\u2019t you just take her and then never drive her anywhere again? You\u2019ll get practice letting your love be bigger than your fear, and she\u2019ll be grateful forever. You\u2019re her sister, not her parent, her life coach, or her judge. Redditors always vote for hard line retaliation and forget about loyalty and compassion. If you choose to say no here, even though you\u2019re not really anxious anymore and even though you\u2019re pretty certain she\u2019ll wear a seatbelt, it will just be a power trip. And what are you punishing her for? Being a typical stubborn teenager? I\u2019d suggest that tendency to dig the heels in no matter how much it distresses others might run in the family. Pick kindness.", "Yes, that happens here in the UK. As a parent you simply have to refuse to drive if your kid won't buckle up. Same goes if it's someone else's kid, it's  the driver who gets the fine not the parents.", "It depends on where you live. There's plenty of kids in the UK even now who's parents arrange a taxi to get them to and from school. When my dad was taxing a couple years ago the kids who got a taxi every day at the same time would have had the same driver every time so the kid and parent would get used to seeing the same car and driver.", "That\u2019s my thought too. It\u2019s either the seatbelt situation or OP\u2019s sister is a poor influence/teammate in other ways.", "These are amazing and awful. We had one where someone turned into an elephant to demonstrate the force that you exit the windshield with and we used to solemnly buckle up and say \"don't want to be an elephant\". \n\nI would quite like to know how they filmed that first one safely, it doesn't seem possible.", "Another excellent set of videos is the Red Asphalt series. Those videos scared me straight when I was learning to drive.", "It's because the parents are claiming it's just a short trip in an attempt to convince OP.  That doesn't actually mean it's a short trip.", "As a teacher, I've seen some students take Ubers that their parents have called for them.  Not sure if it's precisely legal on our end, tbh, but the young lady I see doing it the most is a very responsible kid.", "When I was a kid, Uber didn't exist!  Damn I feel old.", "That\u2019s good. My sons grew up pre-Uber. Funny, though: My oldest\u2019s first job after getting his MBA was with Lyft!", "Uber drivers have the option of not taking any ride they don't feel like taking.", "Right that's how the whole thing works"]}
