I hate driving. My sister (15f) likes going out with her friends, so I have to drive her. She hates seat belts. She scoffs and rolls her eyes and calls me a \"pussy\" because for some reason she thinks she's invincible. She never wears hers, no matter what. There's been times where I won't start the car until she puts it on and she just unbuckles as soon as I start driving. I even pulled over and refused to drive again until she buckled and she took her seatbelt off asap.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was driving her and her friend to the movies. On the way there was something in the road. I don't know what it was because it all happened so fast but it was something big, likely something that fell off of or out of a car. I hit the brakes and changed lanes. My sister went FLYING and slammed into the back of my seat. She wasn't hurt at all and everyone is safe, but I was shaking the rest of the way. When the movie was over I refused to go pick them up and my mom had to.\n\nFor the past two weeks I have refused to drive her anywhere and my parents have supported me in this. She's missed hanging out with her friends multiple times because my parents were busy or just didn't feel like driving.\n\nMy sister LOVES lacrosse, she loves her team, and it's really important to her. She has a super important game Friday morning. My parents cannot drive her and asked me to drive her this Monday, but I told them I will not drive with her in the car. They told my sister that she's responsible for finding her own ride. She said okay.\n\nIt's now Thursday night. The match is coming up and she mentioned me driving her-- I said absolutely NOT! She said I was her ride. I said there's no way in hell! We argued and eventually she cried and begged, promising me she'll wear her seatbelt. She can't find a ride now, she doesn't want to let down her team, etc. I told her if she flew through my front window in a car wreck and ended up in the hospital, she'd REALLY let down her team, but she didn't seem to care then.\n\nShe's absolutely devastated. Her whole team is upset with her, plus her coach. I know she's learned her lesson by now and she'll absolutely buckle, but I'm just so angry with her because the only reason she's listening is because she has something to gain. I just keep saying that this is what it would be like if she had gotten seriously hurt and couldn't play.\n\nMy parents are really upset with me and told me I have to drive her, but they're out of town so they can't do anything. They spend time and money for her lessons and equipment and games-- it's a short drive and I have to suck it up because I can't ruin something so important for her.\n\nWorse, the nervousness has dissipated. I would feel comfortable driving with her because I know she'd buckle, but I'm standing my ground.\n\nWIBTA if I don't take her?", "created_utc": 1691107697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hkk8d/wibta_if_i_purposefully_make_my_sister_miss_an/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In most states, the driver is at fault when a passenger doesn't buckle up. Your sister's bs bravado act is stupid and dangerous to begin with, but she's putting you at risk as well. She apparently needs to learn big girl lessons the hard way.", "NTA. OMG horrifying! She had her chance and SHE BLEW IT. you\u2019re under no obligation to drive her. \n\nShe\u2019s on a team \u2014 she can find a ride with someone else. Doesn\u2019t anyone carpool anymore? Or call Uber. Or a cab! That what they are there for.", "NTA, i wouldn't drive period if someone isn't wearing their seat belt. If something like that happened then they definitely wouldn't be allowed in my car again.", "NTA. Absolutely not. Your sister played a stupid game and won a stupid prize. She had plenty of time to make alternate plans but chose not to, because she thought she could get her way. She fully deserves this punishment.", "Actions have consequences, and she's learning it now!  Don't budge, though.  Also, if a cop pulled you over and saw her without a seatbelt, you'd be responsible as the driver of the car.  Do you want to be held liable if she fails to comply?\n\nYWNBTA.  If her fantastic friends, parents of said friends, and coach care so much, they'll make it happen.", "Call the Police on the business line.

Your insurance will go up.\nYour sister is the AH.", "NTA. Of course she'll keep it on this time. But will she take it off again next time when there's nothing in it for her?\n\nYou made a rule. She repeatedly broke it. There are consequences. Let her beg a friend's parents to drive her. Take an Uber. Call a neighbor.

If she's really changed, she'll show you, and if not, you're back to where you are now and she misses the game.\n\nI could be missing something, but I don't think it would hurt.

At which point you will leave her wherever you\u2019re parked.

Might that be why nobody\u2019s parents are willing to let her travel in their cars?", "How about you agree to take her, and tell her beforehand if she takes off the belt, you'll turn back at once and go home?

How long will you hold a grudge against her?", "> I'm just so angry with her because the only reason she's listening is because she has something to gain\n\n\nShe's listening because she just learned that her actions have consequences.  And not only is that a really important lesson, but it's one that many young adults often learn the hard way (as she now has).\n\n\nYou are justified in your anger, but not driving her would be a bit spiteful if she has indeed learned this lesson.  And the hurt that you will inflict by refusing something that's so important to her is going to stay with her just as long as the consequences lesson will.\n\n\nSo you have every right to refuse...

It will at least teach her about respecting your reasonable request in exchange for a favour.", "NTA. Your sister went flying into your seat. You're lucky you weren't hurt.

I am very concerned about him dealing with underage kids in his car. You're doing everything right and your sister is not immortal.", "Soft YTA from me, she obviously was TA originally by refusing etc but you wanted her to put her seatbelt on, a potentially traumatic experience has made her accept that she will wear one so you could use this as a learning experience for her, but now she\u2019s essentially saying she will do what you wanted her to do whether it\u2019s just for her own gain or cause she learnt a lesson you\u2019ve got what you wanted. So surely it would make more sense to give her lifts as long as she wears it and if there\u2019s ever a time you give her a lift and she refuses you tell her to get out the car and you refuse the drive?", "YWBTA\n\nYour sister is an absolute idiot, but you say she's learned her lesson, this important and affects other people, and your parents have made this an official task. I think this should be the final chance ever, if she unbuckles just turn around and never drive her again.", "I support your position on seatbelts whole-heartedly, but I think YWBTA if you refused to even consider driving her under reasonable/appropriate conditions.  It would be very easy to tell her that you will only drive her if she is wearing her seatbelt, and if at any moment you catch her without it on while you are driving, you will immediately turn the car around and drive home, no second chances.", "She's not your responsibility.   Your parents are AH's.", "YWBTA,  but you could give her one more chance. Tell her, in front of your parents, the rules. She stays buckled up or you immediately turn around and go home. If she unbuckles after the game, you turn around and the coach drives her home. Parents have to agree,  she had to agree, coach has to agree. No more chances. One more time, even 2 feet from the garage on the way home and she's done.", "Honestly I think YWBTA, yeah. You're not nervous anymore and now you're sure she'll buckle her seat belt. She's obviously missed enough stuff that she's learned her lesson, and honestly I think you're holding her to the standard of an adult when teenagers are known contrarians. \n\nI also think that if it's your parents' car and if they pay for any or all of your vehicle related expenses for you not to drive her, as your parents would then be paying money for an extra vehicle that doesn't actually add any level of efficiency to your household.", "100% of the time people will only change their behavior if they have something to gain or lose.

The natural consequence of that is missing the game. It's up to you whether you stick to that and force her to suffer that natural consequence, and your parents should be doing that too, not making you responsible for her poor choices. \n\nIf you take her, make it clear that you are doing it under protest, that this is well beyond a sisterly favour, she now owes you big time, and you expect that favour to be repaid.

I do like the consequence already suggested that if your sister removes her seat belt you will immediately return home if you are taking her away from home, even if she puts it back on.  If you are taking her home you can pull over in a safe place, perhaps a parking lot, turn the car off, pull out a book, and read for a while.\n\nYou need to do this every time she is in the car with you.
