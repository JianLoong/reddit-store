I hate driving. My sister (15f) likes going out with her friends, so I have to drive her. She hates seat belts. She scoffs and rolls her eyes and calls me a \"pussy\" because for some reason she thinks she's invincible. She never wears hers, no matter what. There's been times where I won't start the car until she puts it on and she just unbuckles as soon as I start driving. I even pulled over and refused to drive again until she buckled and she took her seatbelt off asap.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was driving her and her friend to the movies. On the way there was something in the road. I don't know what it was because it all happened so fast but it was something big, likely something that fell off of or out of a car. I hit the brakes and changed lanes. My sister went FLYING and slammed into the back of my seat. She wasn't hurt at all and everyone is safe, but I was shaking the rest of the way. When the movie was over I refused to go pick them up and my mom had to.\n\nFor the past two weeks I have refused to drive her anywhere and my parents have supported me in this. She's missed hanging out with her friends multiple times because my parents were busy or just didn't feel like driving.\n\nMy sister LOVES lacrosse, she loves her team, and it's really important to her. She has a super important game Friday morning. My parents cannot drive her and asked me to drive her this Monday, but I told them I will not drive with her in the car. They told my sister that she's responsible for finding her own ride. She said okay.\n\nIt's now Thursday night. The match is coming up and she mentioned me driving her-- I said absolutely NOT! She said I was her ride. I said there's no way in hell! We argued and eventually she cried and begged, promising me she'll wear her seatbelt. She can't find a ride now, she doesn't want to let down her team, etc. I told her if she flew through my front window in a car wreck and ended up in the hospital, she'd REALLY let down her team, but she didn't seem to care then.\n\nShe's absolutely devastated. Her whole team is upset with her, plus her coach. I know she's learned her lesson by now and she'll absolutely buckle, but I'm just so angry with her because the only reason she's listening is because she has something to gain. I just keep saying that this is what it would be like if she had gotten seriously hurt and couldn't play.\n\nMy parents are really upset with me and told me I have to drive her, but they're out of town so they can't do anything. They spend time and money for her lessons and equipment and games-- it's a short drive and I have to suck it up because I can't ruin something so important for her.\n\nWorse, the nervousness has dissipated. I would feel comfortable driving with her because I know she'd buckle, but I'm standing my ground.\n\nWIBTA if I don't take her?", "created_utc": 1691107697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hkk8d/wibta_if_i_purposefully_make_my_sister_miss_an/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So surely it would make more sense to give her lifts as long as she wears it and if there\u2019s ever a time you give her a lift and she refuses you tell her to get out the car and you refuse the drive?", "YWBTA\n\nYour sister is an absolute idiot, but you say she's learned her lesson, this important and affects other people, and your parents have made this an official task.

The natural consequence of that is missing the game.

This will only end with severe injuries, and you taking the fall for it. Maybe, after doing something so stupid for so long, she will finally realize just how bad it is and won't do it again. In any case, she got herself in this situation.", "NTA. Can't the parents pay for a taxi/ride share for her? \n\nShe is breaking the law, and putting you at risk! I mean, you're both very young, and hopefully she'll mature quickly and this will all blow over, but meanwhile you haven't received the apology you deserve, and you should be in charge of the timeline to get over this.\n\n(The reason for her acting like she's invincible? She's 15. Her brain is not fully grown yet. Neither is yours, but you seem to be *way* ahead as far as that's concerned.)", "NTA - I feel your pain.  My younger sister had the same attitude.  This was back in the days when seat belts were not mandatory to wear, but dad preached their effectiveness.  I was to take her somewhere.  Told her to buckle up & she refused.  I just sat in the driveway while she threw an ever increasing temper tantrum.  She caved.\n\n10 years later - she has now been in TWO accidents where the only reason she walked away was because she wore her seat belt.  Both times the cops & EMTs were explaining that made all the difference for her survival.", "Definitely NTA, beggers belief that she's already seen the dangers of not wearing a seatbelt and hasn't taken your trauma into account. The rules for you driving her are in plain sight, if she won't follow them, that's on her.", "NTA, she contributed to your driving anxiety by not wearing her seat belt.  In addition, in many states it is illegal for drivers under 18 to drive with minors in the car without an adult.", "Soft AH  \nThis is a good time to make her start wearing the seatbelt.  \n1. require her to sit in the front - it is too dangerous to have her behind you without a seatbelt, and too hard for you to see if she's wearing it.\n\n2. If at any time she takes it off. Refuse to drive anywhere, and after she puts it on, you drive straight home. Kick her out of the car if she makes a fuss about it.", ">So I have to drive her\n\nI stopped reading for a second to pop down and post this.\n\nNo. You don\u2019t have to drive her and your parents are fucking assholes parentifying you.", "NTA", "Just do what my brother would do. Make sure no one is following you and then you yell \"ANT CROSSING\" and hit your brakes quickly", "NTA. She didn't try to get a ride from anyone. Her plan was to try and force you to drive her.", "NTA. If her appearance at the game is that essential then her coach or team can come get her", "You said she learned her lesson.  Be the bigger person and take your little sister.", "NTA, but I would sit her down and give her this deal \u201cI will drive you tomorrow if you promise to always wear your seatbelt moving forward. If you ever argue with me about wearing seatbelts again I will never drive you again\u201d The deal isn\u2019t that you\u2019ll drive her tomorrow, it\u2019s that if she ever argues or otherwise gives you shit about wearing a seatbelt then that\u2019s it.", "NAH. Your sister was an absolute idiot for not buckling up, but she's still so young. We're all idiots at that age.\n\nPerhaps she's learned her lesson? It's not neccessary, but it sure would be nice of you to agree to drive her with the caveat that if she *ever* tries to ride without a seatbelt with you *OR* you ever hear she's done this with *anyone* else driving, you will never drive her anywhere ever again. \n\nAny decision you make is going to be valid in this situation, but there is room here for forgiveness and for her to grow and learn.", "NTA but just in case no one has said it: based on ages mentioned I wouldn't be surprised if your denial to take her after saying she has changed her ways results on you losing your driving privileges.  Especially if you don't pay for your own insurance, own the car, have a job that pays for the car and so on.\n\nNot saying it would be right or fair but from experience with parents that sound like yours and being the oldest myself, I always got screwed over too.\n\nI hope I am wrong and that your parents back your judgement.", "send pic's and videos to your parents of what happens when someone doesn't wear there seat belt ask them if there ok if her head gets caved in from an accident because they made you drive her tell them if she dies its on them, make sure to record your self saying that you did not want to drive her and how she doesn't wear a seatbelt. as proof if anything dose happen god forbid because if something happens people will try and put the blame on you", "NTA lmao natural selection will eliminate this one for sure", "NTA- in no way she performed the second that she routinely removed her seat belt.\n\nI got a bad rep at my old job where I drove adults with developmental disabilities.  I did not start the car until everyone was buckled up.  \n\nI was called a spoiled sport. By my co-workers who should know better.\nIt wasn't till the regional manager who when vetting complaints and heard about it said that it was a legal thing.\n\nShe could have died.  You in sure have trauma from it.", "I\u2019d say take her this time, and on the ride remind her that if she unbuckles you are turning around and going home. Also any future unbuckling will forfeit any future rides period, even in identical circumstances. Make her verbally acknowledge what you stated. Do NOT give in if she break it this final time. Use this as her lesson. Either way you are NTA, but I\u2019d advise using this as a lesson and taking her as long as she\u2019s buckled and with her knowing the weight of future unbuckle shenanigans", "NTA, but I think she\u2019s learned her lesson now. I\u2019d drive her to her game, so long as she wears her seatbelt. If she takes it off again, then that\u2019s it, no more rides. Ever.", "What do you ultimately want here? Never to drive her again? For her to learn her lesson?\n\nIf you think she did, give her a ride. Stipulate that if she ever causes a problem when you are driving ( no seat belt, distracting you, etc) she will no longer get any rides again.\n\nIf it's something else, go with what your head & heart tell you.  Just be prepared to lose your own driving privileges. Your parents asked you to drive her so they may punish you for not doing it.", "No, she's a legal liability to you.\n\nIt's not even about safety at that point. Although when she gets flung out a windshield, she'll change her mind.\n\nNot wearing a seatbelt is the stupidest shit you could do.", "NTA... I know I'm some random stranger on the web but proud of you for sticking to your boundaries. As a victim of two car crashes (always the unlucky passenger!) I would never wish what I went through on anyone. \n\nGood for you!!", "Also, a passenger not buckling isn't just dangerous for them. An unrestrained body flying around in the car in a serious wreck can cause severe injuries for the other people in the car as well. She's putting OP at risk in more ways than one.", "Wouldn't be surprised if the teammates told their parents about what she does lol, that's probably why nobody wants to take her (assuming she's asked)", "My great-aunt used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not wearing that seatbelt thing,\u201d and I\u2019d reply, \u201cI won\u2019t take you shopping unless you do.\u201d And she buckled up.", "Excellent!", "Will she wear it on the back..", "This. Totally NTA if OP just decides not to do it, that's 100% valid.\n\nBut there's a *chance* that this whole situation, and almost missing something that's really important to her, has been enough of a wakeup call that sister might finally get it. \n\nOP if you want to, you could give her one last chance. \n\n**Sister, I understand how important this game is to you, and that you don't want to let down your team. Because of that, I'm willing to give you ONE LAST CHANCE. Wearing seatbelts in my car is NON NEGOTIABLE. I will not start the car until you put on your seatbelt. If you take off your seatbelt while I'm driving-- or if you even try and \"joke\" like you're pretending to take it off -- I will turn the car around and come straight home and that will be it. If you can agree to this, I will drive you to your game**", "This is honestly the best way to go about it (maybe). One last chance or face the consequences. If this game is really that important to her, then she\u2019ll listen", "Absolutely not. What a distraction for a driver, to not know from moment to moment if their passenger is going to unbelt.\n\nSis has made herself undriveable. Unbelievable stupidity", "That\u2019s the problem with people who show you repeatedly they aren\u2019t trustworthy. They aren\u2019t trustworthy. Once she spends some time proving - not just blowing smoke, but PROVING - that she\u2019s finally got it, only then does she get a reprieve.", "My parents have talked to her and have took my side up until now. They just think I should make an exception for this game. \n\nShe'll likely start buckling but so far the only thing she's lost is a shopping trip with friend or a pool party, stuff she didn't really mind missing. This is substantial and I want to show her how not buckling isn't just silly and annoying, it's a huge issue.\n\nI'm just hoping after this she'll realize that I'm serious about my ultimatums with driving and that I won't cave the second she realizes she messed up.", "Huge", "So...what happens if she puts it on the just takes it off halfway to the destination?", "I'd stop after this. My idea is to really drive home the whole \"if you were in the hospital, you wouldn't make it to the game, either\" thing. At least she'll be at home watching TV instead of a heart monitor.", "[https://youtu.be/lw2aevh6oZ8](https://youtu.be/lw2aevh6oZ8)", "They bought it but it was a gift for me.

Thanks for the feedback though, all-knowing reddit user.", "I don't know how I'll be punished but I know my parents won't take my car. When they give gifts, it's always with the understanding that it is a gift and not a bribe. My phone and car are mine. They're more \"natural consequences\" people. \n\nWorked for me. Just sucks that my sister's \"natural consequence\" would be flying out of a car window at 70mph.", "I feel like the fact that she waited until the last minute to start asking even though she had been told by everyone that she was responsible for finding a ride proves that she hasn\u2019t learned her lesson. She thought you would be pressured into caving in the end and she wouldn\u2019t have to concede a thing, and your parents are almost proving her right. I think you have to stick to your guns this time if you want anything to change.", "If the coach was really upset about her missing the game, then coach would find or give her a ride. Same goes for sister's teammates. She's not as important as she thinks.\n\nIf you refuse to follow your parents' instructions just because you want to be stubborn... that's a risk. Only you can decide whether to take it.", "Why can't she take a cab alone? Many people take cabs alone at  younger ages...\n\nIn any event, it's up to her to find a way to get you to relent, and getting mad at you shouldn't be helpful to her and your parent's cause.", "I agree with this friend", "I feel like she would wear it to the game then start with her crap afterwards when she has nothing more to gain.", "Exactly this-- it would probably be like a two hour walk if she took no breaks and hustled. Just not feasible, especially before a game.", "Use this thing called a brake, stop and park the car and refuse to continue the journey until it\u2019s back on or they get out and walk the rest of the way", "you go back home.", "You can make this the hill you want to die on with her, but the right to use the car is a privilege that your patents can take away from you for not driving her after they've asked\n\nYou really just have to decide what's more important to you, the independence you get from driving or making this point to your sister", "People do keep saying this about the coach finding her a ride-- we live out of the way for most people, it would probably add at least another half hour. It's a lot to spring on last minute, especially when there's already a lot of carpooling and planning to get the team there. Just bad luck ig. Someone will likely step up in the morning and do it because the girls are close for the most part", "Not in my family. Simply feels unsafe putting a young girl in a car alone with a stranger.", "Does she have a bicycle?", "She said she tried that tho, and it sounds like a huge waste of OP's time and gas\n\nEdit: although making them walk the rest of the way and just dropping them off wherever they are is dangerous, but I do hope it would work.", "But why should OP waste all that time and gas for it?", "They won't take my car, not something they do.

Your parents are cool with a 17yo driving all over the place but not with a taxi? No offense but you're a much bigger danger than any licensed cab driver just by your inexperience as a driver, especially with your sister being such an asshole. \n\nStand your ground. Put her in a cab, have her stay on the phone with you. When she comes home, sit her down and have a serious talk about what the rules will be from now on in the car.", "I stand corrected", "To be fair, this is a very new addition.
