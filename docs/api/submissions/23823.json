I hate driving. My sister (15f) likes going out with her friends, so I have to drive her. She hates seat belts. She scoffs and rolls her eyes and calls me a \"pussy\" because for some reason she thinks she's invincible. She never wears hers, no matter what. There's been times where I won't start the car until she puts it on and she just unbuckles as soon as I start driving. I even pulled over and refused to drive again until she buckled and she took her seatbelt off asap.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was driving her and her friend to the movies. On the way there was something in the road. I don't know what it was because it all happened so fast but it was something big, likely something that fell off of or out of a car. I hit the brakes and changed lanes. My sister went FLYING and slammed into the back of my seat. She wasn't hurt at all and everyone is safe, but I was shaking the rest of the way. When the movie was over I refused to go pick them up and my mom had to.\n\nFor the past two weeks I have refused to drive her anywhere and my parents have supported me in this. She's missed hanging out with her friends multiple times because my parents were busy or just didn't feel like driving.\n\nMy sister LOVES lacrosse, she loves her team, and it's really important to her. She has a super important game Friday morning. My parents cannot drive her and asked me to drive her this Monday, but I told them I will not drive with her in the car. They told my sister that she's responsible for finding her own ride. She said okay.\n\nIt's now Thursday night. The match is coming up and she mentioned me driving her-- I said absolutely NOT! She said I was her ride. I said there's no way in hell! We argued and eventually she cried and begged, promising me she'll wear her seatbelt. She can't find a ride now, she doesn't want to let down her team, etc. I told her if she flew through my front window in a car wreck and ended up in the hospital, she'd REALLY let down her team, but she didn't seem to care then.\n\nShe's absolutely devastated. Her whole team is upset with her, plus her coach. I know she's learned her lesson by now and she'll absolutely buckle, but I'm just so angry with her because the only reason she's listening is because she has something to gain. I just keep saying that this is what it would be like if she had gotten seriously hurt and couldn't play.\n\nMy parents are really upset with me and told me I have to drive her, but they're out of town so they can't do anything. They spend time and money for her lessons and equipment and games-- it's a short drive and I have to suck it up because I can't ruin something so important for her.\n\nWorse, the nervousness has dissipated. I would feel comfortable driving with her because I know she'd buckle, but I'm standing my ground.\n\nWIBTA if I don't take her?", "created_utc": 1691107697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hkk8d/wibta_if_i_purposefully_make_my_sister_miss_an/", "score": 1460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So surely it would make more sense to give her lifts as long as she wears it and if there\u2019s ever a time you give her a lift and she refuses you tell her to get out the car and you refuse the drive?", "YWBTA\n\nYour sister is an absolute idiot, but you say she's learned her lesson, this important and affects other people, and your parents have made this an official task.

The natural consequence of that is missing the game.

Just so mean and spiteful, there's nothing at all to gain or achieve further.", "Her sister is a reasonable person. You aren\u2019t.", "Correct assumption then because her sister is standing her ground and proving how reasonable she is", "Especially at 15!", "I mean, her parents said they wanted her to make an exception and she said they are out for town so they can't enforce anything, which she is trying to show actions have consequences which can apply to her to that the consequence of not driving her sister is that she loses car privileges. Seems very much relevant", "Could be wrong but i believe the burden of responsibility (and the fine) swaps to the passenger when they reach 14 in the UK. Although driving with someone who isn't wearing a seatbelt could still be seen as careless driving I guess.", "AND THE SISTER HAS AGREED TO WEAR A SEATBELT", "If OP drives her, it\u2019s a 15 minute drive there. For someone else to pick her up, it\u2019s 15 minutes to get her plus 15 minutes to the match.", "Maybe I'm too much of a softie, but I would probably agree and see if she actually holds up her end of the bargain and puts on the seatbelt or not. Then if she fights even once, not take her. Turn around and go home if you've left and she takes it off. It kind of sucks not to give her a chance to prove she actually has changed her tune, and make her team lose a teammate for the game.\n\nYour car, your driving, your decision. I don't think you're TA for it. But I wouldn't make the same choice", "NTA.  But you should take her, but tell her you have had it and she will buckle with you every time or you will just turn around and take her home.  Then stick to that.\n\nI have a good friend who was all \"they can't tell me to buckle up!\" when the law passed. A few months later he hit a pole in the snow and got ejected from the drivers seat through the closed passenger window. He could have died and almost lost his eye.", "NTA. There's consequences for stupid reckless behavior. This is one your sister is having and hopefully she truly learns from it.", "NTA! She needed juioce", "NTA\u2026stand your ground and do not drive her.", "NTA - show her this safety advert from rhe UK. It's an old one, but we all remember it. \n\n[\"Julie Knew her Killer\"](https://youtu.be/mKHY69AFstE)", ">There's been times where I won't start the car until she puts it on and she just unbuckles as soon as I start driving\n\nThis sounds like a discussion between a parent and a 7 year old kid, NTA your sister needs to grow up", "I think if you didn\u2019t take her, she would be so upset that she would never wear a seatbelt again so it might be the time that she really realizes what the deal is.  Take care and obviously anytime the seatbelts on you stop.\n\n\u201c I will take you to your game, under the condition, you will be the law and put your seatbelt on immediately and not take it off and if you ever do that ever again, I will never drive you anywhere.\u201d", "NTA.  Where I live it is actually a fineable/ticketable offense to allow anyone under the age of 17 to ride in a passenger vehicle with OUT being secured by a seatbelt.  \n\nOP - check the laws in your area and if there are consequences for someone under age to be unsecured in a moving vehicle, ask your parents if they will post the fine or bail you out of jail because your sister's game is \"so important for her\"?", "NTA - f\\*ck around and find out.", "LOL. Its a 15 year old kid missing a game due to her own stupidity, not a crisis. The hyperbole is a bit much.", "OMG she is terrible", "Seriously. It's not even about her safety, necessarily - you become an uncontrollable missile in the car when there's an accident. Your skull is big and thick and heavy - it can kill your friends and you at the same time. She's 15, not 5. \n\nI don't drive anyone anywhere without a seatbelt. My cousin, who I live with and drive a lot has started to take off their seatbelt as we pull into the (very angled, blind, on a hill) driveway, and it's driving me nuts, to the point where I might not drive them anymore because it's so disrespectful to my desire to keep everyone in the car alive.", ">My car my rules.\n\nIn many (most?) places, I think it's more than that. If you drive around with an unsecured child in the car, the driver is likely to be liable.", "> Plenty of people would call a half hour a short drive\n\nmaybe... but those people would NOT then turn around and say \"we live out of the way for most people\" in the same breath.", "YES you absolutely would be. How if you take her, and the seatbelt doesn\u2019t stay on that\u2019s her final warning you don\u2019t do it again. But you said yourself you think she\u2019s learned I think you should give her the chance rather than wasting your parents money for lessons", "NTA\n\nShe obviously doesn\u2019t care about the team if she didn\u2019t bother finding a ride like she was told to do. She made her choice. Too bad", "NTA. It's too late by now, but I say do NOT drive her and do NOT budge. She's being insanely childish and if this continues she will end up injured or worse. Even if she doesn't care for herself, does she know YOU can get in trouble if a passenger does not have a seatbelt?", "Honestly, find some videos on car crashes without a seatbelt. Hell the IIHS did a slowmo with an umseatbelted rear passenger and they crushed the driver.\n\nYou can find them on various subreddits or online. She *needs* to see the results of people who don't wear a seatbelt.", "Nta. Teenagers are stupid about seatbelts. When I was learning to drive and had friends very much like your sister who would remove their seatbelts once I had started driving.... Once I caught on to that I started \"break checking\" my friends, normally reserved for tailgaters but works for unbuckled passengers too... A break check is when you slam on the break for no reason whatsoever on an empty road going from 50lkm/h all the way to a dead stop as fast as the breaks will allow... The only warning they would get is when I would yell \"break check\" before slamming the break and sending the unbuckled passengers flying... They would complain and I would respond \"you wouldn't get thrown around if you were wearing a seatbelt\" took a few times before they learned I would never fail to break check them if I heard the seatbelts disengage.... No music either... Couldn't hear them trying to be sneaky with music..... Graduated licenses are probably a good thing.", "NTA this kid could have died and STILL won't buckle up? Who cares what she is a part of, she doesn't care about her life still and you don't owe her by destroying yours with a manslaughter charge.", "My best friend was a chronic \u201ctoo cool for seatbelts\u201d person. She learned quickly that i brake check if I think any passenger is not buckled. She wears a seatbelt no matter what car she\u2019s in now. \n\nI always tell my passenger(s) if they\u2019re hesitant about buckling, that I don\u2019t allow that while I\u2019m driving for selfish reasons. Because if I get in an accident, and they go flying thru my windshield, I will be too traumatized to ever drive again and that is *way* too inconvenient for me. It usually gets them to laugh, put down the defensiveness, and buckle.", "You said it\u2019s a fairly short drive from your house to the venue.  This means it\u2019s a fairly short drive for someone with a vested interest to come pick up your sister.  \n\nThis is NOT YOUR responsibility.  Not at all!", "I agree. But my rules in my car are everyone wears a seatbelt children under a certain age or size sit on either a booster seat or a full child seat and no one does anything stupid that distracts the driver.", "A few years ago my family was driving home from a beach vacation, about a 3 hour ride from most of our homes, 8 hours for Brother-in-law and his girlfriend and their kids.  The kids wanted to ride with mother-in-law and father-in-law. Brother-in-law, sister-in-law and were too lazy to swap out car seats, so 3 kids, 2 of whom should have been in boosters, rode home on the expressway with Mother-in-law and father-in-law.  They ran over something, got a flat and Mother-in-law lost control of the car and hit the guard rail.  2 of the kids wound up with cuts and black eyes.  Mother-in-law lost her license, and both she and father-in-law were charged with child endangerment.  Brother-in-law and the girlfriend were later charged with child endangerment as well, and had an open CPS case on them for months.  (They were charged because they had been following, stopped after the accident, and told the cops they didn't think putting the car seats in in-laws car was \"that big of a deal.\"  Granted, there is a difference between a 15 year old and a 4 and 5 year old.  But if g-d forbid something happened, YOU would be the one facing possibly months, if not lifelong repercussions.  I would NOT take sister to her game.  You are more than likely correct that she hasn't really learned her lesson, because she hasn't missed anything super important to her.", "Keep brake checking her until she gets it. Nothing teaches you to buckle up faster than breaking your nose on a dash.", "lol I'd love to hear all the ways you have perfect judgement in all aspects of life, oh wise one."]}
