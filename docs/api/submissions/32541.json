My fianc\u00e9 and I were thrilled because we were eager to start a family. We told our parents and our closest friends only because we were too excited to keep it a secret. Twelve weeks in, I went for my first ultrasound and there was no heartbeat. We were devastated. I told my close friend that we lost the baby and she was supportive. \n\nAbout three months later she asked me to go to dinner with her. I thought it was a nice gesture since I hadn\u2019t seen her since I lost the baby and I wasn\u2019t going out much because the depression was pretty heavy. She told me at dinner that she was pregnant. I said I was excited for her - I genuinely was - but tears welled up a little because I was still grieving losing our pregnancy. She saw the tears, her face changed, and she made a comment that she asked her mother if she should even tell me and that her mother said she shouldn\u2019t let my loss ruin her happiness. I agree with the sentiment - she deserved to be happy! - but hearing her say that while I was fighting off tears definitely hurt. I didn\u2019t say anything, finished the dinner, and went home. \n\nNot long after we discovered I was pregnant again. We managed to make it past the 12 week mark and we were able to determine we were having a daughter through genetic testing (we opted for the testing because of the previous miscarriage.) I was thrilled. A week after we learned the sex of the baby, I miscarried again. There were complications this time; my body was holding onto her and I was starting to get sick because of it, so I ended up in the hospital having to have a d&c. After a lengthy, awful procedure and a brief hospital stay, I was sent home to look for funeral parlors to claim her remains. If we didn\u2019t claim her within three days the hospital would \u201cdispose\u201d of her, so I was scrambling to figure that out while also trying to process a second loss. \n\nOne week after we lost our daughter, that friend had her child. Also a daughter. She sent me her hospital information and I wanted to go, but I was still processing losing my daughter. The thought of going to the maternity ward so soon after being in one myself but leaving without my child was paralyzing, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to go. The relationship was strained afterward, and we no longer speak to one another. I think about her often, and have tried to reach out to connect a few times, but she leaves me on read and never responds. I feel like it\u2019s my fault the friendship fell apart because I couldn\u2019t put my grief aside to focus on her joy. \n\nAm I the asshole for not sucking it up and going to the hospital to see her baby?", "created_utc": 1701957653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cw7gl/aita_for_not_going_to_see_my_friends_baby_in_the/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's hard enough on its own without going to a maternity ward full of healthy babies and happy parents. A week after one of those losses, it's completely understandable why you wouldn't want to go.\n\nI would have sent her well wishes, maybe some flowers, but you're not at fault for not going in person.\n\nIt's unfortunate timing that her pregnancy happened around the same time, but she could be a bit more understanding why you're not jumping up and down in joy for her.", "NTA\n\nYou were still grieving.  Your mental health is more important than most other things.\n\nMiscarriages are not often spoken about, but they are very common.  Women go through a lot a private turmoil when they miscarry a desired pregnancy.  I am sorry for what you are going through.\n\nThe only people I think who should go and \"see a newborn\" while in the hospital are the grandparents, and relatives.  In the US, if the pregnancy didn't have complications, mother and child are often discharged within a day or two of birth.  Some people can't change their schedules so quickly to make a hospital visit.", "NTA.  She's not much of a friend if she couldn't understand how painful it would be for you to visit her at that time in your life.", "NTA...I am truly sorry for your loss.  You are in no way to blame for anything in this scenario. Your friend was thoughtless to even suggest that you visit a maternity ward.  You deserve better friendships.", "NTA - loosing a child is a horrible trauma, My deepest condolences for having to suffer that twice. This isn't something you \"suck up\", and certainly not in such a short period of time. However communication is key, maybe she only saw how you were not there for her and didn't realize the depth of your suffering. You could try to write her how you felt about your miscarriage and that while you are very happy for her, the wounds were still too fresh for you. Often people just don't know why something is happening, esp. if you tried to hide your suffering from the world. All the best!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think your friend was very inconsiderate towards your feelings. It sounds like she was not there for you during your loss, only popped up again to take you to a restaurant to tell you about her news. (I also think a restaurant was an inappropriate choice all things considered.) Nonetheless you were joyful for her but also still heartbroken for yourself. It\u2019s understandable. \n\nI really can\u2019t imagine expecting my friend who had lost two of their babies to come rush to the hospital to see mine. If the roles were reversed I don\u2019t think she would either. This isn\u2019t a friendship loss you should blame yourself over and quite frankly I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to repair it either.", "NTA and what your friend said at dinner was extremely shitty\u2014i would not have stayed friends with her after that. I am so sorry for your losses \ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude75", "NTA you have plenty of time to see her baby. No one came to the hospital to see either of my babies (we are long distance) and I didn't care. And you have a valid reason to not want to be there.", "the initial 5 years ago threw me off, I thought you had lost the first pregnancy 5 years ago, then your friend got pregnant. But it seems like the correct reading of it was that this ALL happened 5 years ago.\n\nIt makes perfect sense what you're feeling, but it's not your fault. We do the best we can, with the resources we have and the information we have. \n\nYou just went thru a tough hospital stay and a painful process in all sense of the word. You were in survival mode. You chose not to go visit her because of SURVIVAL. Who knows how badly a visit would have messed with your mental health and therefore your physical health so soon after your loss.\n\nFriendship change, they end, and it hurts. But friendship is a two-way street. You were hurt and grieving, a good friends would understand that, even if she also needed support during her own delivery. \n\nit's been 5 years. Please forgive yourself and make peace with it. You tried to fix it, and she isn't meeting you half way. You deserve some peace now OP. Hope you find other friends who do support you and put in the effort.", "NTA. After such a loss, it would have been inappropriate for you to go to the maternity ward. A friend would understand. You can be happy for her, but not be able to be near a new mother and her new baby because it rips open your fresh wounds of losing your babies. \n\nI lost touch with someone who announced their pregnancy around the time I was miscarrying. I can be happy for her, but every milestone her child reaches, reminds me of my loss. I moved shortly thereafter, so not sure if we would have stayed in more contact, but I can never look at her child without seeing my loss. I don't burst into tears anymore, or go to a dark place, but I do get a bit sad. \n\nWhile joy should be priority, you don't have to stop grieving because she is experiencing joy. It sounds like that is what she expected of you. You cannot put grief on a shelf when you feel like it. Or if you can, sometimes it falls off the shelf and smacks you in the head.", "NTA. On top of what you went through, it is completely understandable that you were unable to face a whole ward of new babies. Hopefully your friend will return your message once the worst of her baby fog has worn off. If not, it was not that strong of a friendship to begin with. I am so sorry for your losses.", "NTA \n\nYour friend should have had more empathy for you during that time", "NAH - you didn't do anything wrong, you were grieving and you're allowed to grieve, but neither did she. She had a baby to take care of now and a life to live, and needed to move on without you to live that life and have her own joy. This is just a sad story with no villains.", "NTA, not visiting after an experience like that is 100% understandable", "NTA-She may have been hurt you didn\u2019t visit but a true friend would understand why it was difficult for you to visit the maternity ward instead of freezing you out. I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I would let this friend go. I think that the type of trauma you're going through is very understandable. Your friend should know that. I don't think that you not showing up at the hospital should ruin her happy time. Making you go back into that situation would have been cruel, and it would have been better to see the baby another time.", "NTA. You were grieving TWO LOSSES. You had to take care of yourself. You did good and by her reaction, I'm happy that the relationship got strained because she was never a good friend from the get go.", "NTA.  You lost two children.  I am so sorry for your loss.  Yes, it is good to celebrate good times with people.  You are friends and want everything good for her.  But the loss you suffered is NOTHING small.  If she can't sympathize that loss, especially while holding her healthy child, then she would be an A.  I don't know how I would have felt in your shoes.  If I would have wanted or even been able to go to the hospital.  The fact that you have since reached out and tried to connect makes me think that she is TA.  She definitely has one sided views on friendshsip.", "NTA\n\nYou were literally in the week after the second miscarriage when your friend have birth. Your friend's feelings may have been hurt, but she should have been the one offering you tenderness, understanding, and care, both in the moments and days after your losses, through understanding and gentleness when you couldn't come to the hospital after she gave birth, and through care in offering you a loving relationship after that while you processed your feelings. \n\nShe should have been checking in with you and been able to allow your emotions to exist alongside her joy. She has instead failed to offer you any of that, failed to meet you where you were at when you were grieving, and  succeeded in being selfish and turning away from discomfort.", "NTA. Not only did you have two miscarriages fairly close together, but your second miscarriage was physically and emotionally traumatic and you were busy looking for a funeral parlor for your child only days before your friend wanted you to come to the same maternity ward to see her newborn. Your friend also told you, in words, that your grief shouldn't take away from her happiness, in a super awkward dinner at a restaurant where you couldn't escape to process your emotions when she announced her pregnancy. Your friend is callous and clearly has never bothered to read any of the hundreds of articles that have been made available on the internet in the last ten years, about how to talk to someone who has suffered miscarriages.", "I'm so very sorry for your loss...\n\nI've lost a child and it is the worst pain \n\nI believe that is the reason why their is no name for a mother who has lost her child.. \n\nNo word in any language can describe that level of pain..\n\nWhat your friend said was so cruel..\n\nTelling you that your loss shouldn't ruin her happiness...was a shitty thing to do....\n\nA real friend wouldn't have done that to you.especially in a resturant...\n\nA real friend would have just come over for a coffee and told you and would have said... \n\n'I love you and I understand if you can't be around me right now..\nI'm so sorry for your loss...\nIf you want to talk or to see me... just let me know..'\n\nAll she cared about was herself...\n\nWas she allowed to be happy? Yes she was..\n\nBut you can be happy without invalidating how someone  feels about something horrible that happened to them...\n\n\nShe was cruel and selfish...\n\nYou don't owe her anything and you did NOT do anything wrong. ..\n\nPlease stop trying to reach out to her.. \n\nShe has shown you more than once that she doesn't value you or your feeling or friendship...\n\nYou don't need someone like that in your life....\n\nYou are absolutely nta.. \n\nYou deserve better x \n\nSending you a huge hug x", "She is not your friend. I can\u2019t imagine lacking empathy to this extent, wow. Gross. Fuck her, NTA", "NTA\n\nIf your friend can't understand your grief, and how it ties to her life change, then she isn't a friend.", "Nta, she wasn't much of a friend. I see nothing wrong with telling you about the first baby after your miscarriage. But when you start at the tear up and you said that line that her mother told her your loss shouldn't stop her happiness. That was when the friendship was truly over.\n\nYou didn't lose a friend you lost the one-way person who only wanted your support and didn't give you any. So go over your life it's not your fault. You didn't go to the hospital the day the baby was born and not be so lousy friend, no it doesn't it makes her a lousy person", "NAH. You both were entitled to your feelings and reactions and sometimes these things are reconcilable.", "this is a tough one. i would just say NTA because she should have understood your reasoning for not coming, it\u2019s sad to see the friendship fell apart because of it, i think she should have been a bit more understanding on your part. sorry about what happened OP, keep trying <3", "NTA. It sounds like she ghosted on you / abandoned the relationship over your not visiting her in the hospital which is a pretty shitty litmus test for a friendship. Disappointment and mild hurt maybe, in different circumstances, but in yours it was MORE than reasonable to not feel able to go to a maternity ward to fawn over a newborn and new mom during the depths of severe grief over pregnancy loss. \n\nUnfortunately, I wouldn't spend any more time thinking about this. I thought that when she took you to dinner to give the news of her pregnancy she was showing a lot of consideration of you but her reaction to your reaction was pretty callous. Ultimately, you tried to keep the relationship going and with this limited information she doesn't seem like a very considerate friend; in fact she seems pretty self-involved and lacking in empathy, and who wants a friend like that anyway?", "NTA\n\nI would agree with others saying N A H but I think your friend was an AH. Obviously this is your retelling of events but it doesn\u2019t sound like she had any sympathy or empathy towards you and your losses. \n\nI cannot fathom cutting off a friend because they didn\u2019t come to the hospital while they were grieving. I cannot imagine being so self absorbed to think my happiness should trump/negate/erase someone else\u2019s grief. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like you lost a bad friend, not a good one.", "NAH - There seems to be a lack of understanding on both parties. OP assumes the friend should understand why she wouldn't want to go to the maternity ward, while the friend assumes OP would understand why she wants her to be there. What's missing seems to be communication. When does OP tell the friend *why* she doesn't want to go? She just doesn't show. The friend (reportedly) never asks and leaves her on read. The friend should have kept her mother's insensitive remarks to herself, but OP should have told her how hurtful those words were.", "Did a friend know about OP's loss? If not then her response is valid enough to behave like that.", "NAH. it's just unfortunate all around. obviously there's nothing she could do to help you in your grief at that time as she had her own pregnancy/birth going on. i get why you couldn't bring yourself to go. it sounds like it was just bad timing for the friendship. sorry for your losses.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After both my losses I recognised my true friends.\n\nSurround yourself with people who understand your pain not punish you.", "NTA. There are better friends out there.", "NTA", "NTA. So glad people speak about these types of losses more often now. I had the exact same situation. After desperately trying for 3 years,finally pregnant, went for my first ultrasound at 12 weeks and no heartbeat. I also had lots of friends getting pregnant around that time. Generally I would tell them I was happy for them. Then go home and cry. It has been over 20 years and I am still saddened by that loss. Be gentle with yourself. Your \u201cfriend\u201d was being unreasonable under the circumstances. Should have initially let you know on the phone not in person, and in public and she should have had more grace and understanding regarding the hospital visit. Not sure you need a friend like that.", "NTA. She was not much of a friend to you to not be able to understand you were grieving.", "You were processing the death of your child. You are so much NTA it should be visible *from space*.\n\nI am sorry your friend is being self centered right now. She is probably feeling all kinds of things right now, and isn't coping with grace. Try not to be angry with her, and (if you can) leave space for resuming the friendship at a later time. For now, give everyone space. You focus on what *you* need.", "Of course you're not an asshole. I'm sorry for your losses. \n\n  \nIt does seem like you maybe didn't do a great job of communicating with your friend, though. Lots of us retreat into ourselves when we're in grief, which is a very normal human impulse, but it also makes it difficult for our friends to know what's going on and how they can support us through that grief. \n\n  \nDid you tell her about your second pregnancy and loss? Did you tell her how much you were struggling and how fresh your grief was? You mentioned that you told her her about the first one, but you didn't say if you told her about the second time as well. From what you told us here, it sounds like you cried when she told you her news, you didn't really explain why or what you were feeling, and then you didn't really talk to her again until she invited you to the hospital to see her baby. \n\n  \nIf she knew you had lost a child within a week of her birth, it's actually crazy of her to invite you to the hospital to see hers. But it seems like maybe you weren't talking about it with her during this period and she wasn't aware. You also haven't given any detail about what kind of messages you've been reaching out to her with -- do they address what happened and how you were feeling or are you trying to reach out with unrelated stuff?\n\n  \nIf you never told her about your second loss, NAH because I think this probably just a case of two people going through very emotional and life-altering changes at the same time and not communicating very well about it. If you didn't actually tell her \"I'm really happy for you and I genuinely wish nothing but the best for you and your family but I'm struggling to process my own grief and I am not sure what to do or how to come back from this,\" maybe you should think about saying it now. Or, since it's been five years, maybe it's time to just move on. \n\nIf she did know that you had lost another baby a week before she invited you to the hospital to see her healthy one, you're NTA and that was a real jerk move from her.", "NAH. You're grieving, and only you can tell how long it will take you to feel ok, around babies or pregnant women again. Your friends and family should be understanding of that. I hope they are anyway.\nYour friend probably isn't handling this the best way, ignoring you, but it's possible she doesn't know what to say out of fear of you getting upset. I think there's a lot of unspoken feelings between the 2 of you that, when the time is right, will all get worked out if you choose. If you haven't been seeing a grief counselor, I'd recommend seeing one. Maybe it'll help the process.", "I was ok with your friend until she said \"she shouldn\u2019t let my loss ruin her happiness.\" Just cringing at the selfishness of this statement.\n\nIf she'd said she knew it was going to be painful for you, and that's why she chose to meet you for lunch and tell you privately about her pregnancy, that would have been a kindness.\n\nAnd not visiting new mother and baby in the hospital and for the first few weeks at home should become more normalized, given that a newborn has no immune system yet and shouldn't be getting exposed to so many people. You are NTA for that, especially being that you were grieving your second loss just a few days earlier.\n\nBe kind to yourself, you have been through a lot. I'm sorry for your losses.", "I don't agree, I think the friend was very insensitive. Fair for her to tell OP that she was pregnant, not fair to say \"your loss won't take away my happiness\", she should have let her know she was pregnant but also been sensitive to what OP was going through. Also fair for the friend to invite OP to the hospital to meet the baby, but not fair to put pressure on OP to visit, or to decide not to be friends because she didn't visit. None of this was necessary, friend should have been a support for OP, and if she couldn't do that then she could have distanced herself a little temporarily. Destroying a close friendship in the wake of your friend losing two babies is very cold and selfish in my eyes. OP, if you've tried reaching out and she's not responding, it's honestly not worth it, your friend sounds very selfish, only protecting her own feelings and her own happiness and to hell with anyone else. She doesn't know how to be a good friend. Not worth it.", "Absolutely. I do wonder if friend knows about the second miscarriage\u2014she is a huge AH regardless, but knowing about the second very recent loss and still acting like that takes her from huge AH to ultra mega AH.", "The lens I'm seeing it through has nothing to do with either of the women tbh - the only one in this story that I think matters is the baby. I understand why she made her decision to cut things off from the perspective of a mother (for whom this is not a healthy dynamic. She needs to move on and be happy not just for her own sake now), not from the perspective of OP's friend.", "The baby will have absolutely no clue that their mother's friend didn't visit them in hospital.\n\nIf OPs friend can't understand why a woman who's had two dead babies, including one that had to be removed from her body by surgery just days before, doesn't want to be around a newborn then she needs to have her head examined.\n\nNo amount of postnatal hormones makes it right to be upset that you're not the centre of attention for someone who just had to have their baby sent to a funeral parlour.", "If you want to have healthy friendships and relationships then you have to stick with people when the going gets tough, otherwise you will quickly find yourself alone. I can understand her needing to take some distance but I don't understand cutting ties altogether. It also doesn't sound like OP was burdening her friend, it was just that she didn't feel in the space to go to the hospital, which is fair and OPs friend should have understood this. Sounds like OP was ready to support her friend, even though it was hard for her, she just didn't feel ready to come back to the maternity unit so close to her own trauma.", "None of that was my point, my only point was that she's a mother with a newborn baby who has things to do and a lot going on too. I don't think the baby will remember and I don't think this is a \"hormones\" thing."]}
