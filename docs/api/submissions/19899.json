I don't get between my husband and his family and he doesn't get between me and mine.

If they were fighting over whose the uglier one you gotta defend your wife. If it\u2019s over who should\u2019ve been chosen in the Bachelorette, who cares. I know you said \u201cpetty stuff\u201d but after reading this Reddit petty stuff could be anything lol.", "NTA.     \n    \nI N F O what were they yelling about? This is very relevant imo; if they were yelling about some super small simple thing that happened to start a fight, stay out of it. But if it's a larger issue, like your wife's sister was initially being really disrespectful, that might change things. Generally I agree that you should handle your family and she should handle hers, but I also know that I personally really appreciate when my fianc\u00e9 steps in with mine if he sees me struggling (I've had issues in the past with confrontation and am still learning how to properly assert myself).", "Chances are there was no right choice here and if you HAD weighed in you would have been told to butt out. \n\nNTA, imo, barring any missing info that may alter things.", "NTA.  What would your defending her have accomplished?  Three shooting idiots instead of two. \n\nConsider having somewhere else to be if these two are getting together.", "Normally, I'd say you should try and defend her when it is appropriate.\n\nBut you described your wife and her sister as hot heads. I assume they are both adults. They should be able to figure things out without arguing like this.\n\nNTA", "NTA absolutely don't get involved in sister bullshit. I mean, you have to back up your wife's *decisions*, regarding whether they're on speaking terms etc. But getting stuck into their actual arguments is an absolute minefield.", "As many have already said, the topic of the fight means a lot, and would help determine if you were TA. \n\nHaving said that, getting involved in a fight between sisters is RARELY a hill you want to die on.", "NTA but at the same time you are. It\u2019s complicated man. For one, you\u2019re always supposed to take your wife\u2019s side. But there\u2019s times that you know you can\u2019t. When it comes to family squabble, I find it best to try to pull her or both away from the situation. Then while in private, just take her side until she calms down. Then when it clears, you can make suggestions on why she or both of them are wrong. But keep in mind, this may backfire.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What were they arguing about? Is this how all their disagreements end, in shouting matches?  \n\nBut it honestly seems to me like your wife wanted to tip the scale by having you step in and the two of you ganging  up on your sil.", "Nope. It would not end well for you. Sisters may fight with each other all day long but you say one wrong thing and they\u2019re both coming for you. You did the right thing.", "NTA. I fully support my SO by... get this... allowing her to deal with her family. I sure as heck am not going to attack her sister, because we all know I'd be the bad guy there.", "In most cultures, marriage tends to mean \u201cthis person is my partner in everything\u201d. If that\u2019s true in your culture, then the fact that this was her family, or the fact that she was loud, is irrelevant. In this case, you failed to have your partner\u2019s back, and were thus an AH. \n\nIf, in your culture, marriage means \u201cThis person is my partner, but when it comes to their family, they\u2019re not my partner\u201d, you behaved appropriately.", "YTA. Biggest!", "You're NTA. It's much smarter to stay out of the petty disagreements of people who seem to like creating giant conflicts out of small issues.", "NTA is my instinct.\n\nI mean why would she need you to defend her from her sister over a verbal altercation?", "NTA", "NTA - Unless her relationship with her sister is severely toxic in some way, it is better to keep out of it.", "NTA\n\nWife is still angry and since the sister isn\u2019t around to yell at she\u2019s taking it out on you. If this is typical for her, you need to put the breaks on things asap.  Marriage counseling for both and anger management for her.", "NTA\n\nIf she was being berated when she did nothing wrong and not sticking up for herself. Yes then it would make sense to tell her sister to lay off of her. If they are arguing about something, you are not obligated to fight too in an argument you don't want to be in or have no particular opinion about. If it came to slapping or something then I would say jump in.", "NTA it's her sister, it's between the sisters so let them solve it lol it's none of your business", "NTA Stay out of it.", "Exactly, they'll forgive dw because she's family, but inserting himself in their family drama is just opening a Pandora's box of troubles for him.", "Agreed, there's some things that the majority of people agree are petty but apart from that, this could be literally anything.", "OP states they're both wrong. So, they're both the uglier one!", "Good advice, I\u2019m quite similar about struggling to assert myself. Though the wife here sounds like she handles herself fine as he describes her as a temperamental woman.", "Huh? There is no law saying you required to take the wife\u2019s side if she\u2019s clearly in the wrong. If my wife claimed with her sister that 2+2=5, there\u2019s zero chance I will defend such horseshit. OP is NTA.", "idk what OP or Ur cultures is, but in East asian, we don't want to be associated with petty bullshit. and i assure you that in the past and recent years, i have won and lost my fair share of a petty sibling drama. and i would not want anyone else to be part of it. \"Partner in everything\" is a what a guy who never had a meaningful relationship with their parents or their partners would say. would you have him join and double attacking SIL? would you bully people with your partner since \"patner in eveeyting?\" What happens when your partner is wrong but insist that they are correct and ask you to do the same? also, in my culture, we promote self-preservation and independent thinking. Good luck with your culture", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t something you need to be part of. Misdirected anger", "NTA- Unless the fight involved you, it's better to stay out of it.", "You should have her back in her actions, her positions, her parenting (if applicable) and in significant conflicts. She doesn\u2019t want her sister to borrow her car, she doesn\u2019t want mom smoking in her house, she wants to stay NC with dad, back her up. Opinions and arguments and disputes? Don\u2019t go there. Disrespect? Oh hell no; disrespect is never a reason to wade in. Her family, her business, her problem. NTA.", "NTA. My husband and I have been together 20 years and have a \u201cnot my circus, not my monkeys\u201d agreement and it\u2019s always worked for us. We provide each other support if there are family disagreements, but we don\u2019t intervene. You\u2019ll never win trying to intervene. These are relationships that outdate our relationship by 20-30 years.", "The fight was about the wedding of my youngest (another) SIL, DW and her siblings (5 daughters) don't seem to agree on anything beyond the venue (decor, catering, dresses etc.) so DW made a decision with one of the vendors without telling her sister and this one lost her shit upon knowing, DW lost hers as well immidiately when confronted.", "Nope! Hard no. If two grown ass adult sisters are having a verbal spat, you let them have at it (unless you think you can successfully de-escalate things.) They are both capable of fighting their own battles. Using your example - if two adult sisters are fighting over who is uglier OP would be a fool to get involved. What is he gonna do - call his SIL ugly and then potentially have his inlaws turn on him for needlessly inserting himself and insulting her appearance.... Also, a dumb sibling spat can probably blow over quickly - one with an inlaw can grow legs and linger. \n\nUnless these two were going to throw hands, the wife was in a position where she couldn't defend herself or their fight directly involved OP, it would be foolish to get involved.", "The fight was about the wedding of my youngest (another) SIL, DW and her siblings (5 daughters) don't seem to agree on anything beyond the venue (decor, catering, dresses etc.) so DW made a decision with one of the vendors without telling her sister and this one lost her shit upon knowing, DW lost hers as well immidiately when confronted.", "I\u2019ve been on the phone with my brother or sister in the midst of an argument and my husband has given me the look of \u201cthere\u2019s no point\u201d and it\u2019s the most helpful thing he could do. I start wrapping it up and he helps me talk through it. My family has no idea how much he\u2019s helped our relationships over the years by staying out of it.\n\nI also appreciate he doesn\u2019t just take my side. He tells me when I\u2019m being an ass, but thankfully he knows how to do that. You\u2019re not doing your wife any favors by telling her she\u2019s right when she isn\u2019t. Better to just stay neutral if you can\u2019t be honest with her.", "Exactly, this wasn't the first time it happened in the family, they fight and then make up. Not sure if that will apply to me had I butted in.", "Your wife is a MAJOR ahole for changing someone ELSES wedding vendors and plans wtf????", "Yeah, I would stay out of wedding planning chaos - especially when it's not my wedding!\n\nI'm not sure what other arguments they have, but you could definitely use the \"I'm staying out of that\" for the wedding stuff.", "Stay out of this! This does not involve you. Let these siblings hash out their own wedding drama (especially since your wife seems to be in the wrong.)", "NTA and unless your wife was given permission to do things like that, she's a major AH. If one of my brothers did something like that around my wedding, I'd be *livid* as the bride.", "Agreed, but in my experience sometimes women are described as \"temperamental\", \"sensitive\", etc when they're showing any emotions at all, so I didn't want to assume. OP is definitely NTA based on the reply though.", "The argument here isn\u2019t something that you can take sides of something factual like a math equation. It\u2019s an emotional family dispute. I never said it\u2019s a law to always take your wife\u2019s side, but if she\u2019s in a heated argument with someone, that\u2019s her immediate family, that you want no part of it\u2019s usually not a good idea to take the other parties side at that moment. If your wife was arguing with her sister or mom over something petty, your wife wouldn\u2019t appreciate it if you took their side over hers. \n\nYea OP is NTA. I said that. But just a smaller margin, he is. Wife is looking for validation from her partner, just give it to her for that moment to avoid the argument later between you and her. \n\nI\u2019ve been married for 20 yrs. This situation has happened more times than I can count. This is the solution I\u2019ve had to deal with so my wife and I can sleep soundly. The amount of petty things she\u2019s argued with her sister over will make your eyes roll.", "smart man (lol)", "You're smart OP.\n\nI also have siblings. If a BIL inserted himself into a dumb spat with my sister, I would wonder who TF he thought he was..... As would be sister. You leave siblings to it.", "The angry SIL is not the one getting married.\n\nI don't know the extreme details..  from what I gathered is... most of the women agreed something except for angry SIL but that SIL was promised an alternative which she agreed on, then DW and one of the other SIL chose the first plan basically overriding her demand... something like that..", "the angry SIL is not the bride\n\nthe bride probably knew about the decision which was supposedly (as I was told) to be collectively made by her sisters", "Jesus christ, why is a wedding this group sport? The bride and groom should be the only folks whose opinions matter!", "NTA. Avoid engagement at all costs. Shields up and steady as she goes.", "I know the angry sister is not the bride from your other comments. And I hope so. Either way, NTA and smart to stay out of it. As my dad says, don't stick your arm in a woodchipper."]}
