I don't get between my husband and his family and he doesn't get between me and mine. We might vent or have a word with each other after the fight sure, but during the thing we handle it ourselves.\n\nStepping in would've made you the villain in her family's eyes and maybe escalated it further.", "INFO, Idk if you\u2019re the AH or not because the fights info could tell. If they were fighting over whose the uglier one you gotta defend your wife. If it\u2019s over who should\u2019ve been chosen in the Bachelorette, who cares. I know you said \u201cpetty stuff\u201d but after reading this Reddit petty stuff could be anything lol.", "INFO what were they yelling about? This is very relevant imo; if they were yelling about some super small simple thing that happened to start a fight, stay out of it. But if it's a larger issue, like your wife's sister was initially being really disrespectful, that might change things. Generally I agree that you should handle your family and she should handle hers, but I also know that I personally really appreciate when my fianc\u00e9 steps in with mine if he sees me struggling (I've had issues in the past with confrontation and am still learning how to properly assert myself).", "Chances are there was no right choice here and if you HAD weighed in you would have been told to butt out. \n\nNTA, imo, barring any missing info that may alter things.", "NTA.  What would your defending her have accomplished?  Three shooting idiots instead of two. \n\nConsider having somewhere else to be if these two are getting together.", "Normally, I'd say you should try and defend her when it is appropriate.\n\nBut you described your wife and her sister as hot heads. I assume they are both adults. They should be able to figure things out without arguing like this.\n\nNTA", "NTA absolutely don't get involved in sister bullshit. I mean, you have to back up your wife's *decisions*, regarding whether they're on speaking terms etc. But getting stuck into their actual arguments is an absolute minefield.", "As many have already said, the topic of the fight means a lot, and would help determine if you were TA. \n\nHaving said that, getting involved in a fight between sisters is RARELY a hill you want to die on.", "NTA but at the same time you are. It\u2019s complicated man. For one, you\u2019re always supposed to take your wife\u2019s side. But there\u2019s times that you know you can\u2019t. When it comes to family squabble, I find it best to try to pull her or both away from the situation. Then while in private, just take her side until she calms down. Then when it clears, you can make suggestions on why she or both of them are wrong. But keep in mind, this may backfire.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What were they arguing about? Is this how all their disagreements end, in shouting matches?  \n\nBut it honestly seems to me like your wife wanted to tip the scale by having you step in and the two of you ganging  up on your sil.", "Nope. It would not end well for you. Sisters may fight with each other all day long but you say one wrong thing and they\u2019re both coming for you. You did the right thing.", "NTA. I fully support my SO by... get this... allowing her to deal with her family. I sure as heck am not going to attack her sister, because we all know I'd be the bad guy there.", "In most cultures, marriage tends to mean \u201cthis person is my partner in everything\u201d. If that\u2019s true in your culture, then the fact that this was her family, or the fact that she was loud, is irrelevant. In this case, you failed to have your partner\u2019s back, and were thus an AH. \n\nIf, in your culture, marriage means \u201cThis person is my partner, but when it comes to their family, they\u2019re not my partner\u201d, you behaved appropriately.", "YTA. Biggest!", "You're NTA. It's much smarter to stay out of the petty disagreements of people who seem to like creating giant conflicts out of small issues.", "NTA is my instinct.\n\nI mean why would she need you to defend her from her sister over a verbal altercation?", "NTA", "NTA - Unless her relationship with her sister is severely toxic in some way, it is better to keep out of it.", "NTA\n\nWife is still angry and since the sister isn\u2019t around to yell at she\u2019s taking it out on you. If this is typical for her, you need to put the breaks on things asap.  Marriage counseling for both and anger management for her.", "NTA\n\nIf she was being berated when she did nothing wrong and not sticking up for herself. Yes then it would make sense to tell her sister to lay off of her. If they are arguing about something, you are not obligated to fight too in an argument you don't want to be in or have no particular opinion about. If it came to slapping or something then I would say jump in.", "NTA it's her sister, it's between the sisters so let them solve it lol it's none of your business", "NTA Stay out of it.", "Exactly, they'll forgive dw because she's family, but inserting himself in their family drama is just opening a Pandora's box of troubles for him.", "Agreed, there's some things that the majority of people agree are petty but apart from that, this could be literally anything.", "OP states they're both wrong. So, they're both the uglier one!", "Good advice, I\u2019m quite similar about struggling to assert myself. Though the wife here sounds like she handles herself fine as he describes her as a temperamental woman.", "Huh? There is no law saying you required to take the wife\u2019s side if she\u2019s clearly in the wrong. If my wife claimed with her sister that 2+2=5, there\u2019s zero chance I will defend such horseshit. OP is NTA.", "idk what OP or Ur cultures is, but in East asian, we don't want to be associated with petty bullshit. and i assure you that in the past and recent years, i have won and lost my fair share of a petty sibling drama. and i would not want anyone else to be part of it. \"Partner in everything\" is a what a guy who never had a meaningful relationship with their parents or their partners would say. would you have him join and double attacking SIL? would you bully people with your partner since \"patner in eveeyting?\" What happens when your partner is wrong but insist that they are correct and ask you to do the same? also, in my culture, we promote self-preservation and independent thinking. Good luck with your culture"]}
