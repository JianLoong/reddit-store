You would be if you picked someone else for the same price, but it wasn\u2019t in your budget. It\u2019s weird if Ava doesn\u2019t understand that.", "NTA\n\nYou did give AVA the opportunity, she quoted, you found something more suitable\n\nIt's your wedding not AVA's booth at MUA Expo 2023", "First, your money is nobody\u2019s business but yours. You don\u2019t even need to justify yourself on this one. \n\nWith that said\u2026\n\nDid you politely tell the cousin they were out of budget range? Or just say no? Because this could make a big difference in how they see things?", "NTA\n\nThere are a lot of people who don\u2019t mix family and business at all for this reason. If she\u2019s giving you a discounted rate already it would have been gauche to ask for her to cut it almost in half again. The only circumstance where it would have been a bit odd to go with someone else is if she offered the makeup styling as her wedding gift to you.", "NTA. You actually DID respect the time and talent that goes into her work (you didn't ask for a steeper discount). You simply wanted a less elaborate job, which helpfully for your budget would be less expensive. You are not required to change what you wanted and pay more just to \"support someone's business\" at your own wedding.", "NTA. Just say \u201cI really value your talent but unfortunately it was outside my budget. I ended up going with someone more amateur who was more affordable. I didn\u2019t want to undervalue your skill as you do amazing work.\u201d Or something. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t been offended if you tried to cut her price more.", "NTA. It was nice of you to consider your cousin but as you said, she was out of your budget range.  \n\nYou don't owe anyone an explanation about this.", "NTA. People should have the wedding that they can afford and not go into debt over. I understand that her makeup wasn\u2019t going to be the thing that pushed you into years of debt over, but if you can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m not sure why people are giving you shit over this - she told you how much she charged and you said \u201cno thank you\u201d without trying to haggle with her/have her do it for free. The bigger asshole move would\u2019ve been to insist she do it, but not pay her what she\u2019s worth.", "NTA. You do what\u2019s best for you, girl. Business and budget are entirely that, your business.", "NTA  \nBut did you ask her for a simpler look? (not that this is an indictment on you but perhaps maybe she charged you full glam and might have been cheaper if it was simpler)\n\nBut also a MUA who only charged $25 is crazy cheap", "NTA, but did you counter your cousin\u2019s offer at all? You could\u2019ve said, \u201c40 is too much for me, but could you do something simpler for 25?\u201d", "NTA. Everyone has a budget and is able to spend their money how they please. You didn\u2019t hire a different MUA because you didn\u2019t like/ respect Ava or her work. She was gracious to offer you a family discount which was still too high for you, I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve been fair to ask her to go lower, you respected her pricing and declined.", "NTA.  Personally, I would have offered Ava the $25 price if she could do the makeup you wanted for that, but you're not obligated.   You told Ava she was out of your budget, that should be enough.     \n\n\nMan, only $200 for makeup for 8 people?  That's so amazingly cheap.  I would expect to pay at least twice that, not including tip.", "NTA", "NTA. if your cousin really wanted to do it couldn't she offer a simpler package at a lower rate? I don't know much about makeup but seems like a possible solution. \n\nAt the end of the day, It's okay for her to charge what she wants to charge, and it's okay if you determine it's outside your budget. As long as you're polite about the situation of course, which it seems like you have been. \n\nYour family should step up and pay for the makeup or at least the difference it amounts to if they care so much about it having to be your cousin.", "NTA as long as you gave Ava a head's up as to why you went with someone else. Something along the lines of, \"Could you do really simple make-up for $25 apiece?\"", "NTA and your family is being totally awful about it\n\nYou gave your cousin the opportunity to give you a quote and it didn\u2019t work for you. \n\nEven if she had been willing to match the lower quote you might have felt uncomfortable paying her so much less than her standard and you don\u2019t want to be worried about things like that for your wedding. \n\nIn general, it\u2019s not always a good idea to hire or work with family on something as emotionally charged as a wedding. What if you didn\u2019t like how you or the bridesmaids looked, would you have been comfortable discussing with her? \n\nIf she\u2019s good at what she does there should be plenty of work without needing family to hire her.", "Slightly NTA. It\u2019s your wedding so you should be able to decide what fits your budget and where u can spend money. Contacting your cousin and telling her why you went with a different makeup artist probably would\u2019ve helped you avoid the drama and would\u2019ve been a little more considerate. However, it\u2019s your special day and your family putting so much stress on you for something like this is unfair.", "NTA. you already told her no and had a very valid reason. it would've been a different story if you turned her down and went to someone at the same price level and similar makeup as to what she could do", "NTA. Involving family in important matters and events Carrie\u2019s a major double edged sword. If you had agreed to using your cousin and things didn\u2019t work out then there would have been major repercussions. \n\nRather than debating this issue with family members I would simply state that you feel like your cousin is extremely talented but you wanted a more subdued look that would not adequately showcase her talent. While you understand their disappointment the bottom line is it was your weddings and therefore your decision. Let them know that your wedding was everything you envisioned and you would appreciate it if they would drop this matter since the event is over.\n\nIf they continue their tirade, block them and move forward with your life. You don\u2019t need this unnecessary drama.", "NAH \n\nJust be honest that you were looking for something more affordable.", "Nta\n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to hire a family member. You found someone that fit your budget.", "You DID respect her business and her talent by not trying to low ball her, and finding someone who could provide an adequate service at the right price point. NTA. \n\nThe next family that complains to you should be asked if it would have been better to make a lowball offer, show complete disrespect for her time and talent??", "NTA. You did respect her. You didn't ask her to lower her price, but you found someone to do a basic job that was within your budget.", "NTA. You found an artist who could do the look you wanted for the price you could afford.\n\nThe fact that Ava and her flying monkeys are harassing you over this doesn't bode well for her business. Ava is behaving very unprofessionally.", "NTA\n\nYou have a budget. You can\u2019t afford her. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nPerhaps ask her if she can match the price.", "Info: did you ask her for the price for a simpler/more natural look?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Having that conversation exchange in an e-mail thread would come in handy when the other hens of the family chimed in.  And had they continued to complain about 'supporting' your cousin...then perhaps they'd only all too happy to contribute to the make-up budget.", "I would have said \u201cI do not want to mix family and business and I just want you there as a guest and not to work\u201d", "NTA. You're respecting your cousin's time and business and didn't try to haggle her down to half her rate. If she'd wanted to do a simple makeup for $25, she would have offered, and if SHE complains (not her mom/aunt/grandma/cousin, she herself) you can tell her the truth: her rate did not fit into your budget. You love her makeup (and maybe you can hire her to do yours?) but you cannot afford it, and you're not expecting her to go beyond her already generous discount.", "But you did respect her time and talent. You did that by not price haggling her. Dear God, does she harass every prospective client that can\u2019t afford her?", "I\u2019m getting on the wedding story = karma farmer train.", "NTA.  I would respond to her that you were respecting her time and experience by not asking for a further discount as you could not afford her rates.

If the style does not match she has every right to find somebody who fits her better. She can still support Ava by recommending her to all friends etc.. she is not obligated to hire her", "Eh.  Even if someone else is the same price, paying a family member to do a wedding service is always a little dangerous and inviting drama.  It would also be ok if you didn't like the work she did, or is the case, her work is not what you are going for.", ">But also a MUA who only charged $25 is crazy cheap\n\nI'm going to guess this is why the cousin was saying that OP doesn't respect the artistry of make-up artists. I'm sure the cousin has to justify her prices to customers all the time because people always want artists to work for free. $200 for a wedding, assuming that OP wasn't charged for travel, is cheap.  Many people only look at a price tag and not what goes into that, including the artist's time, skill and materials. When choosing a cheaper artist, it's like saying those things don't matter, so I can see how the cousin would be offended. \n\nThat being said, OP should have very clearly explained that her decision was based on her budget, assuming she's interested in avoiding family conflict and maintaining a relationship with said cousin.", "That type of haggling is what pisses professionals off and makes them feel undervalued and unappreciated. You\u2019re right in that OP should\u2019ve said that the $40 was way out of her budget, but then left it for her cousin to come back with a counter offer.", "Depends on how simple the makeup was. I've done theatrical makeup for a cast of 10 in an hour with people doing their own foundation. I'm betting a professional doing \"simpler makeup\" could probably get them done in 15-20 minutes per face. That's about $75 an hour.", "Someone I get the feeling she would\u2019ve been called an asshole for undervaluing her family member\u2019s talents. It\u2019s lose lose.", "In the area where I work, it\u2019s at least $100 per person. I almost can\u2019t imagine $25 per person looking good.", "This is a logical approach but brides typically already have a lot going on before the wedding and the suggested conversation might not have gone well so the OP may have wanted to avoid it. \n\nFor instance, I've been in similar situations where family members, friends or other clients have contacted me to ask me why I didn't hire them for an event and when I told them I went with a more affordable person because of my client's budget, they all got angry and defensive, shouting and telling me why they charge the amount the charge / that it's justified. \n\nI just sat there listening - then said, \"I agree with you. That's why I didn't reach back out to haggle or negotiate with you, but I had to go with what the budget would allow.\" \n\nThey were still mad and the conversations were very awkward.  A few people asked that, in the future, I come to them with all potential jobs (and negotiations) because they will sometimes accept less / charge less, depending on opportunities for exposure.", "Yes to both and as your cousin why didn\u2019t she offer to do it as your wedding gift?  She saw this as an easy business opportunity to make a few bucks and is upset she didn\u2019t collect.", "I completely agree with you bc it seems like she didn't fully explain this to her cousin. Honestly maybe the cousin isn't the AH here. I might want to go with NAH."]}
