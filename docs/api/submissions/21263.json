While I appreciated her offer, I had to say no because it didn't fit within my budget.\n\nI found another MUA who charged $25 per person (for much simpler makeup), which was more affordable for me and my bridesmaids. I booked this MUA and everything went well on my wedding day.\n\nHowever, today Ava texted me that some family members asked why I hired a different MUA instead of giving Ava the opportunity. Some of the family have texted me calling me TA for not supporting my younger cousin's business and making her feel awkward there. While I would love to support her, I didn't have the moeny to do so in my budget. I have seen her social media posts and can see why she charges so much, but the makeup I wanted was much more natural and I couldn't justify Ava's prices for me and 7 bridesmaids. I told Ava that I can't afford her makeup and she is calling me TA for not respecting the time and talent that goes into her work.\n\neta- I didn't ask Ava to price match. Her usual rates are $75 dollars, and asking her for  a discount on top of what she quoted me seemed disrespectful. My husband and I are Mexican, so got married in our hometown, and I hired a local artist instead and tipped her on top of her rates as she was much cheaper.", "created_utc": 1688424758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pxm1b/aita_for_not_hiring_my_cousin_to_do_my_makeup_at/", "score": 721, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While you understand their disappointment the bottom line is it was your weddings and therefore your decision.

I'm sure the cousin has to justify her prices to customers all the time because people always want artists to work for free. $200 for a wedding, assuming that OP wasn't charged for travel, is cheap.  Many people only look at a price tag and not what goes into that, including the artist's time, skill and materials. When choosing a cheaper artist, it's like saying those things don't matter, so I can see how the cousin would be offended. \n\nThat being said, OP should have very clearly explained that her decision was based on her budget, assuming she's interested in avoiding family conflict and maintaining a relationship with said cousin.", "That type of haggling is what pisses professionals off and makes them feel undervalued and unappreciated.

I almost can\u2019t imagine $25 per person looking good.", "This is a logical approach but brides typically already have a lot going on before the wedding and the suggested conversation might not have gone well so the OP may have wanted to avoid it. \n\nFor instance, I've been in similar situations where family members, friends or other clients have contacted me to ask me why I didn't hire them for an event and when I told them I went with a more affordable person because of my client's budget, they all got angry and defensive, shouting and telling me why they charge the amount the charge / that it's justified. \n\nI just sat there listening - then said, \"I agree with you. That's why I didn't reach back out to haggle or negotiate with you, but I had to go with what the budget would allow.\" \n\nThey were still mad and the conversations were very awkward.

Your family wants you to give your cousin money you simply don\u2019t have, and you can\u2019t be blamed for that.", "NTA- and Ava's got it backwards.\n\nIf you didn't respect the time and talent that goes into her work, you would have insisted she lower her prices even more to match your budget.\n\nBut that's not what you did at all- you completely respected her work and her time, knew she was already lowering her prices, and so you didn't insult her skills or time by asking for an even steeper discount... you simply found someone whose prices matched your budget and makeup application style fit your preferences.\n\nYou clearly understood that Ava was absolutely worth the price she was asking, but unfortunately that price wasn't something you could afford. Which is fine and completely okay.\n\n(Personally, if I was an MUA and had a friend or relative getting married and I really wanted their event to be in my portfolio? I'd have told the bride that if she wanted, the makeup could serve as my gift to her in lieu of a cash gift or something off the registry. But maybe that's just me.)", "NTA - You pick the best you could afford. That's it. If the family's really that interested in supporting family endeavors, they could've helped pay the difference in cost as a wedding gift. That way everyone's supporting Ava.\n\nAlso, I have a hard time believing that Ava came to this conclusion entirely on her own. OP did say Ava didn't reach out to OP until after other family members started reaching out to Ava. While simultaneously dog pilling OP.", "nta", "NTA. Also, congratulations on your marriage!", "Regarding \u2018not respecting time and talent \u2019 comment by your cousin, I think you can respond that this would have been true had you asked your cousin to lower her rates to $25 for her work or do that free of cost. But you did not do that bcoz you respect her talent and her rates. But if they were out of your budget and not in sync with your theme, there was no disrespect that happened by going with someone else.", "Not respecting her talent / material / hard work would mean you would force her to adhere to the $25 price tag or asking for it for free, which you did not do. \n\nNTA", "I think that who she picks for her wedding makeup is her prerogative, regardless of which relative can offer the same service and what price they offer.", "I disagree with this. Not all make up artists are created equal. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect someone to hire a MUA just because they\u2019re family. Some are terrible, and others have specific styles that the bride might not want.", "Besides,  isn't it better as a family member is free to enjoy the wedding rather than be working? \n\n100%NTA. She offered but family isn't an obligation when it comes to business.  \n\nEveryone who has  a problem with this is TA.\n\nThe wedding is about the couple and what they want. not supporting the business ventures of family members.", "I paid $175 the last wedding I was in. \n\nFor just me", "Agree with the judgement and the fact it was cheap.i personally would prefer a stranger as \n1. allows the family member to actually enjoy the day and the event itself \n\n2. If there is something I don't like about the work I can speak freely not walk on eggshells cause it's family and they might be upset - especially on such a special day as the wedding day the bride doesn't need this extra stress IMO\n\nNTA", "Jup, a bad idea it is. My wife' uncle partner was a jeweller so we accepted their offer to make the wedding ring. Unfortunately he cheated and they broke up, so in the end she charges us full retail price, the ring were not at the correct size and we had to get the ring after a very awkward conversation with her about how bad the uncle is (I don't disagree but how is that our responsibility?) Definitely won't recommend using friends and family for wedding vendors.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you could've told her when you hired the other artist that her price was too much for you to afford. \n\nMaybe she could've given a lower price considering you didn't want more intricate work done?", "NTA you did respect her time and her talent because you didn't try to barter her down", "NTA because of the last sentence. If it wasnt for that, i would have rated N A H, because it seemed like a communication error. If the makeup was much simpler and therefore cheaper, you maybe should have given Ava the opportunity to adjust her offer that fits more to match that price. But I guess with such an attitude Ava shows that would not have been possible.", "NTA. Your reasons are perfectly valid. Ava Is being a bully.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe Ava the job just because she\u2019s family, especially when her services don\u2019t fit your needs or your budget.\n\nThat\u2019s not a lack of respect.", "NTA. Doing business with family is never a good idea and Ava is showing you way right now. Her behavior is incredibly immature and unprofessional. It also guarantees you won't recommend her to anyone else in the future. Respecting her time and talent doesn't make her fit in your budget. You actually respected her time and talent by NOT ASKING for free or deeply discounted services. You found someone affordable who did exactly what you needed. Be sure to write them a great review. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding.", "But you did respect her time and talent. You knew you could not afford to pay her what she is worth, and did not attempt to lowball her, or pressure her in giving you an even bigger discount. So you went with someone cheaper. \n\nThis was a business choice and Ava is taking it personally. She needs to understand there is a difference if she really wants to have her own business. \n\nNTA", "When someone offer my something at a price I can't afford,I say something like \"I appreciate the offer and price seems fair, but I personally can't afford it\". \n\nShe gave you a good offer and you respected that. You didn't think her talent or effort isn't worth it, just that you can't pay for that talent and effort. That's a decision people make all the time - you sometimes decided to pay less for something simpler. \nYou never didn't anything wrong to Ava or her business. NTA.", "I feel like this could\u2019ve been avoided by just saying \u2018hi, I love what you do but my budget is $xxx. I\u2019m happy to do something much simpler than what you\u2019ve demonstrated to match that budget. Let me know what we can work out!\u2019\n\nNAH but perhaps some better communication could\u2019ve avoided this!", "first of all it's your money, you do with it what you wish. Secondly, it's your cousin's business and time. she offered a discount and that discount was still out of your price range. You should honestly be commended for not trying to force her to do it for cheaper. \n\n\nAlso people need to change how they view \"supporting a friend/family's business\". If you're truely going to support a friend/family member's business you need to pay full price and respect their time and expertise.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs a business woman, Ava is supposed to understand a budget.", "Honestly I think NTA no matter what the price. Her wedding, her choice.", "Doesn't owe? I think it depends on family. In my family even my second cousins deserve a conversation. If they aren't close, then I agree.", "It would have been an AH move to take the job from the other artist if they already had a deal just because the cousin price-matched. A deal is a deal. That artist took the time to talk to the bride, show samples, negotiate an agreeable price to both parties, reserved the day and maybe ordered makeup and supplies. They already put in some work. No reason for them to lose the job if they haven't done anything wrong except not being related to the bride.", "I am a pretty successful makeup artist.  My favorite wedding gift to give? Free make up. Anything that I would need to purchase (lashes, lip gloss, whatever) I do have them buy.  But they don't pay me.  I love to make their special day stress free, and I get to be a small part of it.", "Exactly ! \n\nMy husband best friend was a make up artist (she had a lots of life), but not her main job anymore at the time of our wedding. But i love her style, and i am not very confortable wearing too much make up. So i asked her, if as a wedding gift she would accept doing this for me, while letting her know she has all the freedom to say no, because she was a guest first and foremost. \n\nShe said yes and ended up doing make up for more people than planned (me, my mom and step daugter) she did my aunt, cousin, cousin daughter etc. but she was ok with it and i know they offer to pay and she said no. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in OP's case NTA, and as many people stated, you respected and valur her work as you didn't ask her to lower her price. if you didn't, maybe you should have explained all that before hand so she understood why you didn't pick her", "I had people think that even after I spesficly said that I respect them and their talent and them, and it just too expensive for me to pay. So I wouldn't be so sure."]}
