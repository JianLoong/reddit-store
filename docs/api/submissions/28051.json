But also she should really not speak on this matter so broadly as she can never know everyone\u2019s situation. \n\nObviously she\u2019s clearly emotional and processing having given up her child, but that does not give her a right to insult the choices of others.

It is great that some can and some have the real desire to be, but a lot of kids are not in that situation. Not all biological parents have their kids best interest at heart or truthfully even care.

Of course you both lashed out.", "Nta", "Nta", "It sounds like Katie may have some personal issues to sort out. I'm of the mind no one should have kids if they don't genuinely want to, so giving an unwanted child up for adoption is a terrific move if you feel like you can't or don't want to change your life to accommodate it. But I imagine it isn't all that clear-cut when it really comes down to it, and that there might be some lingering feelings of guilt about the whole thing that she's projected onto you and your situation and wasn't ready ot didn't want to have deflected back onto herself.\n\nOP, I'm really happy for you being adopted. Congratulations! I wish you a wonderful rest of your life after what sounds like a rocky start.", "I was adopted as a 3 month old by a Mom who apparently tried to keep me but couldn't make it work. Do I have more trauma due to being adopted vs not growing up where I was born vs living in 4 countries by the time I was 18 or am I just human and would have had similar hang-ups and quirks if I had been brought up by a single Mom in the 70s? Who knows.\n\nYour situation is YOURS, not hers, and she should not tell you how to feel about your situation.", "NTA. I also was adopted, and while I wished I could have stayed in my own bio family, it wasn\u2019t possible. I mean, if you had no records, how the hell were they supposed to find your family? I understand Katie is hurting too though, but there is also things called open adoptions or being able to stay in contact with the family so she did have options. The only reason she was a slight Ah was her getting annoyed at you for being excited for finally getting adopted! You know what else is traumatizing? Foster care! \nI say, reach out to Katie and say she really hurt your feelings saying you shouldnt be adopted by people who love you, and actively want you. While I agree that the adoption system sucks because of the amount of money needed, that doesn\u2019t take away from your personal joy of having a family! \nCould you personally have used more tact? Yea, but so could she. \nCongratulations on being adopted!", "NAH. The problem with both \u201csides\u201d of the adoption conversation is that no one wants to admit that it's more complicated than one solution for everyone, and their own experiences are not everyone else's. Adoption, or at the very least what leads to it, IS trauma and there are very serious problems with the entire system, BUT this does not mean that everyone is always better off with their blood relatives or that adoptive family cannot be real family. Neither of you are AHs for how you feel, because your situations are very different. I can't hold her outburst against her because she is still a kid herself and likely very traumatized, but neither can I hold your defensiveness in response to her comments against you. You shared your excitement and were basically told you shouldn't be with the parents it sounds like you love dearly from this post. From the way you speak it sounds like you're getting the family you always wanted and you are not wrong to feel happy and excited by that, nor to be upset when someone tells you it's wrong. But Katie almost certainly meant no harm either, and her comments truthfully likely weren't even really about you, she is just vulnerable and hurting.

About Katie, you were right in your response, so don't apologize to her. Katie gave up her baby for adoption, seems to be under duress, or very difficult and traumatic circumstances and while she's partially right about trauma adoption, you're happy about yours, and rightfully so.\n\nI understand the family reunification process, but people forget that not all biological parents/family are safe for kids, and genuinely care about their well-being. Katie was rude and judgemental towards your situation and your parents. Your friends are bozos, that can't accept the reality of Katie's words and awful behavior.\n\nETA\n\nRead your comment about Katie voluntarily giving up her baby for adoption, despite having her parents help and support to keep her baby. Yet, she hated it and now she's \"traumatized\" by the adoption? I get her guilt and regrets, but her comments about \"rich people\" buying babies, and that you should be with family like aunts, or any other family member is nonsensical since a) her parents are well off, and b) she could've place her baby under her parent's custody, yet she didn't therefore her words make no sense.

Really happy for you.  You don't have biological family members that could have been an option and that's really all you have to say. \n\nShe gave her child up for adoption because she was not in a place to look after a baby.  That's one of the biggest sacrifices and most loving acts that someone can undertake.  For most people, even while they realize that it's the best choice, it's highly traumatic and infused with at least some regret and guilt.  It sounds as though Katie is still dealing with that.  She was very unkind in how she responded to you, but if you're able to show her a bit of grace, you're going to see that she spoke out of a great deal of pain.\n\nYou're not responsible for helping her heal anymore than she is for you.  \n\nYou're an example of how adoption can be a positive thing.  At some point she may be in a place where seeing that helps her come to terms with her own difficult decision.", "Right message, but definitely wrong delivery.\n\nYou are lucky because you are getting adopted by a family that sounds amazing. Not all children, as you are most definitely aware, based on your own story, get to be so lucky, and this is probably why Katie said the things she said.

She was HUGELY insensitive first while you're preparing for your very special day, so I totally get why you lashed out (and probably would have too), but what you said was hurtful to her too. \n\nI'm coming at this from several sides. I'm an adoptee. I've reconnected with my birth parents and saw the immense trauma they went through for decades. I've also lost a baby through miscarriage, so I know what it's like on some level to lose a kid. \n\nMany adoptees feel as you do. Many adoptees also hate being adopted. There's no right or wrong way to experience it. I personally think that the problem is systematic - if my bio parents had access to better systems that would have enabled them to raise a child and go to school, they wouldn't have been shoved into a difficult decision like your friend was. \n\nAdoption is often traumatic for both sides, but it's often not discussed. Adoptees who feel this way don't often realize they can feel sorrow and trauma from this until later in life. It's called \"coming out of the fog\" in those communities. (You can connect with all types of adoptees on r/adopted if you're interested!) \n\nI think your friend is dealing with a huge trauma and probably needs some help. You both need to figure out how to talk about this going forward. \n\nYou're coming at this with completely different and equally justified perspectives. She mourns the loss of her child through adoption - adoption is traumatic for her. You, who have no access to your biological family, are getting a family for the first time - adoption is joyful for you. Those are both very valid responses and shouldn't be at odds with each  other. \n\nIn this situation, they're almost entirely different concepts with the same word with how separate your situations are.\n\nTalk to her and find a way to walk forward that works for both of you. \n\nAnd congratulations!

You were excited because the people who have been fostering you for 3 years want to officially make you part of the family, something you've been denied for most of your life.

She might have a pretty unhappy home life, with pressures and expectations she isn't coping well with.\n\nDoes it make what she said to you okay? No, not at all. She was taking out frustration about her life and actions on you, which involved speaking badly about the people you're excited to be adopted by. I'd be worried if you weren't defensive.\n\nDoes it mean what you said was wrong? No. Maybe you could've been a bit more tactful, but she'd just verbally attacked you over something you may have believed would never happen.\n\nImportant bit? She spoke out of anger at her situation and hurt you. If she's one of your friends, maybe take some time aside to go chat with her about things. She might just need a friend to help her deal with the emotional impact of everything. If she's had someone pay her to skip the regular adoption/foster system, might be worth chatting about said system, share a bit of insight. If she's not one of your friends, you can still reach out if you want, but she might not want to talk with you. Maybe nudge one of her friends and say that Katie seems to be having a hard time lately, would they be okay to check in on her.\n\nEdit: Also, congratulations on your upcoming adoption day :) Not sure if it's your thing, but I've heard some people treat it like an extra birthday (Got'cha Day?). Really hope you're happy in the future, and that your parents keep you feeling welcome and loved.", "NTA She, by her own logic, was talking to a \"traumatized\" person.

Not push her views onto you about a system in which you\u2019ve been through. \n\nHopefully she matures and realises what\u2019s she\u2019s done wrong \u263a\ufe0f but as she\u2019s cried and for everyone on her side being yes men unfortunately I don\u2019t get that vibe \u2014 don\u2019t let her get you down tho!

Katie doesn't practivce what she preach, she can't condeem your upcoming adoption, when she just given her child away(I wonder if it was willing, since she came a comment like that, she is minor and your upcomming adoption reminds her of the pain of being unfit mother, but still the hypocricsy). One standard for her and another for you. She is no friend of yours, if she know your history. Family care is great, if there is some one to step up, but in your case, there isn't and so many children in foster system have same problem, even they do have families.

Katie is messed up both from the pregnancy and adopting out her kid that she didn't want. That is no excuse for her to crap on your happiness.  Congratulations on finding your forever family.", "It\u2019s almost like adoption is a process with lots of grey areas where it\u2019s impossible for one rule/procedure to be relevant for everyone. \n\nOf course OP isn\u2019t TA for being excited to be adopted by loving parents after everything she\u2019s been through\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure that we can call a child who was forced into a pregnancy and birth she didn\u2019t have the physical or emotional maturity to deal with followed by the baby she carried for 9 months being adopted by someone else (whether she wanted that or not, it would be hard,) an AH here either. She reacted emotionally, its only been a year, I think she needs therapy rather than being called an AH.", "I mean, it is a really mean thing to say to someone who\u2019s clearly dealing with some shit. But I\u2019m not going to tell a 16 yo that she\u2019s an AH for saying it under these circumstances. She\u2019s not required to rise above Katie being shitty first, especially about something so important to the OP. \n\nI wonder if the friends calling her an AH and not talking to her is more about the friend group dynamics than any objective evaluation of both girls\u2019 behavior. Or just a not very sophisticated reaction to the fact that Katie ran off crying while the OP went on the attack.", "Well, you responded to what indeed seemed like her blaming you for her problems and that's fucked up in more ways than 100. NTA.", "NTA. \ncongratulations on your adoption! \n\nMy child is adopted and where I\u2019m from you don\u2019t pay for the adoption but you do go through quite rigorous classes designed to educate you to the traumas, possible backgrounds, issues etc. that children may have due to the circumstances that led to them being put up for adoption. \n\nKatie was lashing out due to her own unresolved issues. I think what you said was fair and truthful. There is no reason to be negative about putting together a loving family. My child\u2019s biological parents had 8 or 9 other kids between them, (the eldest weren\u2019t caught in time for fostering) the majority went into care and the few we know of all speak about how awful their limited time as children was with the birth parents. Through choice most have no contact with them (open adoptions/letterbox contact very big here). \n\nKeeping kids in families that aren\u2019t actively WANTING those kids is a cruel punishment for all involved.

Come on now, seriously.", "It sounds like she's projecting her situation on others'.", "Yep. Same but then my moms parents. They adopted many children. Official and non official; as in kids were left by their parents and no one cared about these kids.

The grandparents were even  on board to raise the kid until she was stable in life, according to the main post. It just sounds like a half-hearted attempt at masking her choice as something she \"had\" to do.", "The things Katie is saying definitely sounds like she's fallen into the rabbithole of 'adoptee tiktok.' \n\nI've seen the accounts of lots of adoptees who have been hurt by the system and I can really get why Katie is retroactively regretful of her decision to give her baby up. It must be torturous to have so much content from adults who were traumatised/abused by the adoptive process readily available and have to reckon with the guilt of that aged 17. \n\nNone of the things these people are saying is wrong, but the issue is the nature of the tiktok algorithm is that it provides a completely unnuanced and one-sided account of a complex issue. If she's clicking on videos of anti-adoption adoptees, she won't be getting any perspective from adoptees who have benefitted from the process.", ">suspect Katie wasn't given a choice on the adoption and is still processing it.\n\nAccording to op she kept saying that the kid belonged in a bin.
