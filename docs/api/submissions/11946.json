Its too late to want to demand stuff and she cannot force you to have another ceremony. She has a husband and its time she was bold enough to tell her parents about the marriage then trying to pretend that you are unmarried when you meet them for the first time. Talk to her and see if she comes around or else you may have to decide on if the trip to India is worth it along with all the additional things it comes with.

In their eyes, you might not be married anyway.\n- This may be important for them to save face regardless of whether they know you are already married. In other words, collectively accept the idea that you are not Indian-married yet, but also do not lie\n- marriage is a symbolic act, and you are considering honoring the parents tradition and culture, that is all. It doesn\u2019t in any way nullify your existing marriage.", "NAH \n\nI can understand you not wanting to do another wedding ceremony, but your wife comes from a different culture.

She obviously still wants a relationship with them. You say your original wedding was perfect but maybe she wants more of her traditions as well. You have to show respect for your wife\u2019s customs, culture and her families beliefs.

The wedding will be amazing and since you already had one think of it as a party. 2nd PDA isn't acceptable anyway so you won't be able to act like her husband anyways. 3rd.it will make them all happy. 4th if they find out she was married already, they may disown her and it will bring shame to her....now thinking that the culture is wrong. Ok . But you ain't gonna change this by taking a stand. Your gonna hurt her. So play along and enjoy the ride", "NAH, but I\u2019m definitely feeling more sympathetic for her. She lied because she felt like she had no other option - she didn\u2019t want to lose you or be disowned by her family. No, it wasn\u2019t the best choice, but it was one made under a set of difficult circumstances surrounding her culture that as you acknowledge, you can\u2019t come close to understanding. Now it looks like she finally has a chance to have both, and her family accept you - something she had never thought would be possible - and you\u2019re squashing the idea.\n\nIf you want to understand her culture, please get off Reddit (because let\u2019s be real, you know damn well you\u2019re going to find a lot more people here from your culture than hers, and right now you need to be thinking about hers) and do some actual research on it. Talk to your wife. Look up other accounts of white Americans who married someone whose family was all living in India. I have a hunch doing this would show that what she\u2019s asking for here is not super rare. In cultures with such strict social norms and traditions around courting and marriage, children lying to their parents about it is pretty darn common - especially when that child has moved to the US. \n\nDoing what she wants will leave you feeling kinda gross about lying, though that feeling may change once you have an Indian wedding and visit her country. Doing what you want could end with her being disowned. Even if her parents come around, they\u2019ll still want you to have an Indian wedding, and it will still change her relationship with them. So while I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting to do this\u2026yeah, I do kinda think you\u2019ll be one if you insist on telling them the truth about how long you\u2019ve been married.", "NAH Well, I guess it's more a matter of respect for her, her family, and her culture. If you really wanted to get to know them, and learn more about her culture, then it's a no-brainer. You jump through whatever hoops you need to jump through. I think it's neat, the cultural adventure you have the opportunity to take. Good luck!", "Dude I'm just gonna be blunt and quick to the point. You need to divorce this girl now. Here are my reasons. She is treating you like a dirty secret. almost like she is using you to rebel against her parents. Si nce she knew her family would never approve of you. Then why marry you in the first place? Now she wants you to lie and say you are not married so she could have a huge Indian wedding? Just give her one for a vow renewal. But I would dump her because of how she was treating you. Not introducing you to her friends much less her family. Just run dude. I'm telling you. Get out before you have kids. Cause it ain't gonna end well", "NTA. You've already got married. That's an inescapable fact, whether her family knows about it or not. Would she expect your family and friends to fly out to attend a wedding and pretend you're still single?", "I'm probably a minority here but NAH - you're allowed to not want to lie about your relationship, but believe me Indian weddings are huge family event and a great way to experience the culture. Talk it out with your wife, there aren't any stupid rules either other than the wife stays with the family the night before the official ceremony and has a girl's and children only event a few days before.", "ESH - in my opinion, you both went into this deception together and for, as you've said, at least three years. i think it's an AH move for you to all of a sudden decide it's your righteous choice to stop deceiving your in-laws. ultimately, you are married now and if you want to remain married, these are decisions you have to make together.\n\nhaving said that, the expectations that your wife is sharing with you are deeply engrained in indian culture. i'm having a hard time understanding what your 'end game' is here - do you WANT to be accepted into her family or not? because purely based on the information you've included here, it kinda sounds like 1) you've played a role in lying to her family for years now, 2) on your own terms, you've 'decided' you just want to show up in her home country and casually reveal that you not only dated her without their knowledge, but you up and married her without ever meeting them, and 3) part of their culture are these big, beautiful, and culturally rich weddings, and you're already showing a lack of support and/or a disinterest in that. so, INFO: is your goal even to remain married and to get in the good graces of your in-laws? or just to travel to india and blow shit up in her family?", "ESH. She should\u2019ve come clean before marrying you. I think first generation immigrant kids from more traditional cultures often get comfortable lying to their families, but she took it too far\n\nAt this point, you didn\u2019t put your foot down sooner, this will help them like you and make it easier for your future kids, and give her a chance to have a wedding that represents her culture", "YTA\n\nYou need to approach her culture the way she says. You\u2019re trying to impose your culture\u2019s values as if they are correct and hers are wrong and that\u2019s really poor behaviour.\n\nGo, sleep apart, let them conduct your marriage according to their rites and enjoy not having to lie anymore.", "Hmmm I kinda think ESH, because she should have been more upfront with her family especially if she does not depend on them financially. I'm not unsympathetic because I'm Asian as well and understand some of the pressure your wife would have been under. \n\nBut also...soft YTA for you op. If a big Indian wedding is what would make all her family happy then what's the big deal to just do it? How can you claim to want to know more about her culture and want to raise your children with proud identities if you can't even do this? I do get where you are coming from, and you've been very patient to not push her on telling her family about you. But 'coming clean' etc etc and expecting them just to accept you and your wife's situations is a very western perspective and will cause problems - more likely for your wife than you. \n\nBut going forward why not just do the second 'wedding'? Sounds like you won't see them super frequently in the scope of your life if you're based in the States. Marriage is about compromise. Pick your battles - this is not the hill I would die on.", "INFO. Did you know this was coming? Did she communicate this before you got married or is she just dumping this on you now?", "NAH.  Culture and familial pressure can be quite a burden for one to carry, and she may even want a ***VERY LARGE*** and traditional Indian wedding.  Should you go through with this, it will be an amazing experience.  I'm a white guy and have been fortunate to be included in portions of a traditional wedding. Insane and an amazing cultural experience.\n\nThis type of wedding may be critical for her parents to accept the \"white guy.\"\n\nI also believe she needs to be more honest with her parents, and I also understand why it would be very, very hard.  I don't think ESH and understand how difficult this is for everyone.", "NTA. She is likely so culturally and emotionally enmeshed with her family that they are guilting her into doing things their way. You can either:\n1. Go along with the plans, even though it is lying (Lord help you if they find out!) and against YOUR culture, or\n2. Insist that you ARE married and living together, and risk having her family blow up at her, which could hurt her. Or cause her to cut them off, which may give her the impetus to commit more to the life you two are building here. \n\nYou and she need to really talk!\n\nI see no easy path here.", "YTA. You're talking about a country that still regularly reports honor killings. Listen to your wife.", "NTA. She \"broke down\" and said she can't keep this secret from her parents any longer \u2014 and yet, she wants to *continue* to keep it a secret that you two are already married \u2014 that you've been married for *a year and a half* already.\n\nWhat will happen if you travel to India with her secret intact, with the intention of meeting her family and then having a big Indian wedding, but her parents hate you and forbid her to marry you? Will she send you packing? Will she stand up to her parents? (Hint: If she's not willing or able to tell her parents the truth *now*, she will *not* be willing or able to defy them and \"marry you anyway.\")\n\nI think if she's willing to tell her parents that you're already married, and they want to hold a big cultural Indian wedding celebration as a sort of second ceremony or affirmation of your vows or something, you should be willing to go along with that, especially if her family will pick up the tab so it doesn't even cost you anything. But I agree you should be very reluctant to present yourselves to her parents as an unmarried couple wanting to get married there. I don't see how anything good can come of that.", "I think Y T A for not wanting to do another wedding considering her family would pay. Lots of couples do multiple wedding celebrations when their respective families are in different locations and/or are part of different cultures. It shouldn't take away anything from the specialness of your first wedding. Wouldn't anyone in a loving relationship love the chance to get to declare their love all over again? This would essentially have the same function as a vow renewal\n\nIt's unclear by your post which of the two of you is putting more pressure on you to visit India with her, but if it is her, then she is an Asshole as well fot expecting you to partake in a lie if she didnt make it clear when you decided to elope that she was eventually going to expect you to interact with her parents in the future and also maintain the lie.", "Are you saying the wife is TA?\n\nN T A means there is an asshole, but OP is not it. For no assholes there exists N A H (no assholes here).", "That\u2019s just a ridiculous take lacking nuance, that\u2019s obviously heavily contextual and this seems to be a situation in which pressure and culture played large roles in a decision that wasn\u2019t born out of malice. Dooming a relationship without even trying is quite literally the opposite of putting the work in to make it work.", "The Prime Ministurd has spoken.", "So OPs the AH because he doesn\u2019t want to lie about his marriage?", "They were both complicit in the lie, and she\u2019s not putting her parents comfort above her husband, she\u2019s trying to ensure her relationship survives period. It\u2019s obvious that they have a good marriage with each other but compromises are necessary when dealing with such magnitudes of social pressure.", "I agree regarding OP's obvious distaste for the Indian wedding. It's one thing to be uncomfortable with lying about marriage status. It's another to completely dismiss having the Indian wedding.\n\nWhile getting married happens once (legally speaking), weddings do not have to be once. Plenty of couples do two weddings for various reasons. For family that cannot make it to one wedding. To have the experience of doing both of the couple's dream/cultural weddings.\n\nOP is essentially refusing wife's family, who he claims he wants to get close to, to celebrate and wish wife a happy marriage.\n\nIf wife's parents/family can somehow be convinced to forgive the lying about current marital status (BIG HUGE IF), then OP should try actually getting close to wife's family by doing the Indian wedding. Or stop thinking he can get close to wife's family at all and give up pushing wife to make it work his way.", "Right.  \n\nIf this was a white guy who hid his marriage to an Indian woman from his family, then said \"you have to lie to them when you meet them, then you have to agree to go through a catholic wedding to appease them\" when she had no desire to, people would be calling him an abusive monster", "I think this, exactly. The lie has already been told. Take her lead on the best way to make it right. We don't know what revelations would completely destroy her relationship with her family, and OP needs to honor his wife's desire to make things right with them, however she sees fit as she understands the culture.\n\nLet them welcome you to the family with a celebration that in no way negates or replaces the intimate ceremony you already had.", "I doubt it. I don't think it's uncommon in marriages between people of two different cultures (especially when there is huge geographical distance as well) to have two separate celebrations for both cultures/families. The only big difference here is the lying aspect, since OP's wife doesn't want to tell her parents she was married over a year ago.", ">you both went into this deception together and for, as you've said, at least three years. i think it's an AH move for you to all of a sudden decide it's your righteous choice to stop deceiving your in-laws.\n\nI would need to know more about what the expectation OP's wife set for future interactions with her family. It could easily have been that OP was led to believe that she was never going to let her family know about OP, in which case I think it's resonable for OP to ask to not want to put any work into maintaing the deception.\n\nThough, OP seems to be the one pushing to meet her family, and so if he's not willing to meet her family under the conditions tht she has set, then she should have the right to not want him to meet her family.", "I don't think it's fair to say OP an AH for not wanting to lie about being married to his in-laws.  It's like if a gay person asked their partner to pretend to be their \"roommate\" when their parents visit.", ">If a big Indian wedding is what would make all her family happy then what's the big deal to just do it?\n\nHonest question.  If roles were reversed and this guy was like \"I know we are married, but my parents want us to have a big catholic mass at the church I grew up in\", and the wife didn't want to because she was happy with the \"perfect\" ceremony they already had, would you say she was an asshole, and saying \"what's the big deal\"", "While I agree with you, I also don't think these demands are fair.", "If being honest about the marriage means that OP's wife will be estranged from her entire family/culture and there will be massive social shame for her family, then yes, he is an AH if he won't go along with this. Sometimes we have to lie to our in-laws about stuff!! In a case with this big of a cultural difference, the lie is gonna be bigger. It's unfortunate but honesty is not always the best policy when trying to manage relationships with parents/in-laws. OP's wife could've handled this better in the beginning but she messed up and is trying to do her best to fix it now without totally destroying her relationship with her parents. Is it fair that she has to lie to them? No. But it is what it is.", "How was he complicit in the lie?  He never met the parents.  You can't lie to someone you've never met.", "The social cultural and familial pressures don\u2019t even begin to compare, you truly can\u2019t fathom what it\u2019s unlike unless you\u2019ve lived it.", "Because the white guy from the US hasn\u2019t grown up in a country with a caste system and strict rules and traditions, and the very real threat of being shunned and disowned if he doesn\u2019t follow them. This is not a situation where you can just reverse the roles and act like it\u2019s a logical comparison.", "Does he have to keep it a secret from his family and friends that he got married again?", "It\u2019s not at all like that. She\u2019s not asking OP to pretend that he\u2019s her roommate or just a friend - the parents know they\u2019re in a romantic relationship. Terrible analogy.", "If his parents were insanely conservative massively bound by social obligations and his relationship with them, his family and his entire culture depended on it and she refused yea I\u2019d say she\u2019s being the AH", "To me, the difference is because that\u2019s about religion, not culture. I know they\u2019re often linked, but they\u2019re not the same. Asking someone to have a second wedding so they can make promises to God in a Catholic Church (like promising you will have children and raise them to believe in God - yes, this is a requirement to marry in a Catholic Church) is not the same to me as wanting a second wedding celebrating Indian culture. It\u2019s very normal for mixed couples like this to have an American wedding and an Indian wedding. Not so much for having a Catholic wedding and a non-religious wedding.", "I mean, sure, I don't understand that culture because I'm not a part of it.  But conceptually, its the same thing.  You want to make your partner start a relationship with a lie, then go through an entire ceremony they don't want to go through.  Regardless, that is a shitty thing to do to someone you love", "Yes, because no one from the states has ever been shunned for marrying outside of their race/culture.  NEVER has happened even once.  As a black guy, there is no way i could ever understand that.", "The point here isn't the title of the relationship its the point of lying. In both the other partner is being asked to lie. \n\nMy point is how is someone an AH for not wanting to lie?", "Isn't there typically a religious aspect to an Indian wedding?  I've only been to one, and there definitely was then.", "That\u2019s just the thing, it\u2019s not conceptually the same thing. The context of the issue massively changes how we should view her actions. Trust me if he doesn\u2019t go through with this either what sounds like a good happy marriage will be ended in an unimaginably messy way involving inter continental war on the part of her family or she will be completely cut from not just her parents but her entire extended family, literally hundreds of people and lose the place she grew up in.", "You keep changing the dynamics to twist it around to try to get you the answer you want. First it was \u201cif a white guy did this\u201d and \u201cif it was about wanting a Catholic ceremony\u201d and now it\u2019s anyone in the US ever being shunned for marrying outside of their race/culture. It\u2019s very confusing and just keeps getting further away from OP\u2019s question and the dynamic actually happening.", "I absolutely understand the complexities race can add to marriage and relationships in the USA being a country defined by systemic racism but with all due respect comparing racism and the caste system is really not equal grounds.", "Well if that\u2019s your point, you chose a shitty analogy to make it - that was my point - that those two things are not comparable because the lie is not the same at all. There are different degrees of lies. I already typed a whole long response to OP about how I don\u2019t think either one of them is the asshole, but I am more sensitive towards her in this situation given that she\u2019s a first-gen immigrant coming from very real cultural pressure and traditions.", "He\u2019s already lying by omission. They\u2019ve been keeping their relationship a secret for three years", "There is definitely religious symbolism and there will be religious aspects to the wedding but most modern day Indian weddings are more like week long parties with considerably less focus on the religious aspect of it.", "There is, but it\u2019s not quite the same. They do pray to God - but in more of a \u201cGod, please bless this marriage\u201d kind of way rather than \u201cwe promise to be good Catholics and raise our children to believe in God and also be Catholic.\u201d As someone who was raised Catholic, this was one of the reasons I put my foot down and did not get married in church just to make my parents and grandparents happy.", "I'm not changing anything.  You are acting like an Indian person is the only one who can relate to being shunned for marrying outside of your race.  Yes, the first point I made was about religion, you then changed it to being shunned for who you married, so I responded to that.", "They are identically oppressive, for all intents and purposes. Low caste people are raped, murdered, and their possessions are taken, with impunity. Low caste people have fewer rights, fewer recourses, less educational opportunities and are taken advantage of at every turn. \n\nThe caste system *is* racism. Codified over a very long time, with appalling consequences for the people at the bottom.", "I don't feel sensitive for her.....she decided to lie to her entire family and hide the fact she was dating this guy for 3+ years. Then continue to hide it for the 6 months after they got married. \n\nBut I give a better analogy to fit than. Let's say OP family a huge Catholics who only respect marriages in a church. Would you feel bad for him that he has to lie and pretend not to be married and force his already wife to have a Catholic wedding she doesn't want. You know, because of all the cultural pressure and traditions", "There are already like three other comments asking this. You can go read the responses on one of them. Still not a good analogy.", "You don\u2019t understand the consequences if you come clean. Maybe her family would completely cut her off. Think of it as protecting her, not as lying. NAH", "YTA.

Your concerns seem to be that this will overshadow your original wedding - which it might! Indian weddings are notoriously gilded affairs.

You said yourself that you don't understand her cultures. So you trust that she does understand her culture? If you do then take her lead and do this for her.

It's a free party being thrown in your favor.", "Saying YTA is too strong, but I side with your wife.\n\nThis is a culture you are not nearly as familiar with than she.  Additionally this is her family, whom you never have met.  Trust and support your wife.

However, I think the compromise here is to be upfront about the marriage but then still have another wedding celebration.  It is entirely normal for couples to have two ceremonies, two celebrations etc one for each culture when your coming from such different backgrounds.  Honestly it's a wonderful way to celebrate your shared culture and an excellent way to learn as much about your wife's culture as she has yours.  It's understandable that the situation with her family might make this a difficult path to go down but if you're both willing then there's some level of inevitability to it.", "YTA. You sir, have basically had your cake and eaten it - you've had the girl, you're fortunate enough that your family accepts and welcomes her, you've had your nice little wedding. It's now not about you, it's about the guilt and lies your wife has had to carry around all this while from her family. If you reveal this to her family, you will ruin her family's reputation to all her relatives, maybe her entire village, you will wreck their acceptance of you and of your wife if you decide to be blindly \"honest about everything\". You risk her and her family being ostracized back in her country. Do you want this all on your head? Be considerate, suck it up, do the lengthy indian wedding, pretend for your wife's sake.

However I'd be willing to compromise by participating in whatever cultural ceremony they still want after she tells them the truth. They want you to stay in different rooms until the ceremony? I'd respect it. I know you've been married for 1.5 years but if that allows her family to accept you in the family, it isn't a high cost. I'd want all this in the open before having kids.

And yet, that is a huge lie given the cultural situation and traditions.  \n\nYou and your wife need together to have this discussion after you do research on what that wedding would like. Agree if that is what her family wants you will do it. No matter what she or her family wants you will do it because you love your wife. Marry her a 100 times of you have to. But it is time to end the lie and move forward", "You're NTA for feeling the way you do, but her parents missed the opportunity to see their girl marry the man she loves. Why not do it. You get to experience what an Indian wedding is like. It's something not many people from the Western world get to experience firsthand. Maybe you can meet somewhere in the middle with this.", "Honestly, it sounds like your wife is so stressed out by this, that she does not realize the impact this lie will have on your whole life now that relations with her family will probably get more friendlier.... like, how will you keep up this lie, when children come and grandparents will want to visit them? Even more so, how will you keep it up in front of 200+ people for a week+ during the Indian wedding ceremony. Your wife needs to put her big girl clothes on and resolve this one way or another, cause this lie will do her in soon enough (mentally).\n\nJust like your wife, you need to man up as well. You do not sound like an AH, OP, but you will be one also if you do not change your view about the marriage ceremony. Currently you sound like rejecting it on principle (oh, we already had a wedding, I will not have another one), but it is an important event in the culture that you apparently want to understand and pass on to your children ...", "Oh hon. You don\u2019t understand Indian culture. You have to go along with the charade unfortunately because we are a bunch of judgemental aunties", "This really isn\u2019t an asshole question. Lots of cultures view the religious celebration as the one that counts. \n\nYou gain absolutely nothing by telling them everything except damaging her and your relationship with them, causing possible family damage.\n\nThis is a situation where you as the white guy has to understand that being culturally insensitive is equally as bad as not telling the whole story and actually to some extent worse because you\u2019re already married and being insensitive to her needs. I\u2019m not calling you an AH though because I think this might just be ignorance not intentional.", "My cousin just had a \"second\" wedding in India. It was an amazing ceremony.

She\u2019s telling you  will be impossible if they find you you\u2019re married already.  She is only asking 2 things from you.  She didn\u2019t even want to do this.  You convinced her and she\u2019s telling you the best way that this can go.  Do you feel nothing when your wife cries? Just do the two things she asked.  He culture is complex and she knows that telling them the truth would actually be even more disrespectful. \n\nShe knows them better than you.  She IS trying to make sure they can accept you and not shun her.  Actually listen to her. Don\u2019t dismiss her again, that\u2019s shitty.", "ESH. I married a Pakistani man as a white woman. They share some similar views/culture so maybe I can give insight. \n\nI dated my husband for 1.5 years before he even told his parents about me. 3 months later I had to meet them and they basically grilled me about my relationship with my husband was. The thing is in these countries, they still do arranged marriages. They actually look down on love marriages. Plus it is very very common for family to disown someone if they marry someone outside their race/religion. What we know in our lives is not like what their culture knows. Our way of life is very foreign to them, just like theirs is foreign to us. You probably will never truly understand it. \n\nWhen your wife sat you down and explained everything to you that would potentially happen, it\u2019s because she wants her family to accept you and your relationship. People in her culture can be very judge mental for very some minuscule reasons. She is coming up with the plan because she doesn\u2019t want any of that to happen. \n\nI give the ruling of ESH because it sucks as the white person to even be put in this situation. She should have done this before you even got married. But she\u2019s doing what she thinks is right because she knows her family and the culture. Trust me, just go along with it. It will really hurt your wife if her family disowns her. I know it can be degrading but it\u2019s honestly something that you just have to deal with as the outsider. If you really love your wife, you\u2019ll do this for her. And if you morally can\u2019t, you may need to divorce.", "NAH, but come on my dude, just put on a smile and do what your wife is asking of you. It\u2019s not a big deal and an odd thing to get fixated on. Like how does it compromise your values to have a celebration with your wife\u2019s family. Her relations are dependent on it.", "While NTA  go ahead a do it. Consider it a vow renewal", "Bit late for qualms about lying to her parents now Bud. Want to experience your wife's culture & traditions? Start with a wedding.", ">I told her I don't want to lie to them about our lives and that it is probably better to simply tell them the truth and come clean\n\nYou should listen to your wife on this because there might not be anything simple about telling them the truth.\n\nSometimes conservative families want the plausible deniability.  It might be easier for them to believe that you came to meet them and get married.  Maybe in another few years they'll be ready for the truth.  \n\nNAH", "YTA. Agreeing to marry her when you knew the situation only to now try and throw your weight around. Making zero attempt to understand her or her culture. I can\u2019t even look at her as a victim, she knew what she was getting into when she as an Indian picked a coloniser of all possible spouses.", "NAH. It is a complicated one because of the cultures. But have you asked her whether a) she feels married. It was a perfect ceremony for you but in other cultures, weddings are as much about the family as the couple; and b) does she feel she missed out on a big event. Pandemic messed up a lot of things and made people settle.\n\nTrying viewing it not as a remarriage but as a celebration of your bond in front of her wider family. Just check legalities of getting married in two countries but expect your current one matters most for things like tax. If in India, a religious blessing if agreeable to everyone may suffice.", "NTA but you need to 100% listen to and trust her on this. White American here, have been with my Pakistani partner 8 years. Thankfully he was divorced before meeting me (VERY TABOO) so I was not subjected to the insane scrutinies and imo harmful pressure I see lots of relationships around him get. They\u2019re most likely going to welcome you insanely warmly like adoption status lol. But saying she even cuddled a man before marriage let alone MARRIED and WITHOUT TELLING THEM would destroy her reputation AND possibly relationship with her family because it would be seen as the ultimate betrayal.

She didn\u2019t like that arranged marriage in her culture, so she found a way to be freed. And it was her choice.  \n\nBut people do do multiple wedding in intercultural family.  It is normal, one for the western style, one eastern style.

I am Indian, so I can tell you, it will not go well if you do it your way. Indians are strict and have a way of doing things. you're not deceiving your in-laws by following what she is saying but actually expecting the way it works, especially if you are not Indian. It sounds tough to hear but lying to Indian parents is the only way an Indian child can be truly happy and also adapt the parents to new ways of life.\n\nShe is simply saying lets dip our toes before we jump in, that's all.", "NTA because she is asking you to lie about your relationship and that\u2019s not fair. They will find out some day and I guarantee when they do it\u2019ll be all that white mans fault and somehow you tricked her into lying just like you tricked her into marriage. At least that\u2019s the case if her parents are as bigoted as she claims. If it was just the wedding that\u2019s the issue I\u2019d say ESH maybe YTA but her asking you to lie is not okay.", "Op should think of it as a super fancy vow renewal.

The lying part will be the timelines, but whatever.", "He definitely doesn't. Western people have a really hard time grasping the extremely complicated family dynamics of a lot of Asian cultures. It's kind of hard to fathom the extreme importance put on religion and tradition. These are things people are willing to destroy familial relationships over, even if it destroys them too because the way these things are viewed is so different there. \n\nI really feel for your wife, I can't imagine having to face my own Indian family after doing this. Please know the anxiety is killing her. She has essentially utterly betrayed her family for you and based on our culture, that's how I know how much she loves you.

He should absolutely consult his wife on if she wants another ceremony, it would be amazing for them if its what they want.

And I think OP is having a hard time understanding the cultural dynamics here.

I know one family who, despite being extremely conservative, accepted the interracial marriage and another more liberal family actually refusing to the point that they haven\u2019t even seen their grandchild (their daughter has been married for at least 5 years and waited for 3 years for their approval before that). \n\nOP, think of this as a small compromise for your wife\u2019s peace of mind.

You could even make this a condition with your wife - you want to celebrate your first wedding as your \"real\" anniversary for the rest of your lives. I think that would be fair.\n\nAlso, it's very common across cross-cultural and geographic couples to have two weddings. I don't think you should be too stressed about this aspect of the problem.\n\nI understand you don't want to be dishonest - but ask yourself if being honest worth the cost of your wife being shunned from her family forever?", "So you were totally cool lying about it for years but as soon as something is expected of you, you're gonna be righteous about it? Please spare us the faux morality here. It won't superceede anything.

You are a party to this and have been the whole time.\n\nYou can choose to end the lie by blowing up your wife\u2019s relationship with her family - thus blowing up her relationship with you - or by finishing the act, at which point the past lie will be a much smaller thing.\n\nSo, the question is, is \u201ccoming clean\u201d now more important than your wife and your marriage?\n\n(The rest of your concerns - that wedding will be bigger and better and that would be bad - are pure imagination and bias.)", "As an Indian girl, let me tell you that all these lies about already being married etc, will not even matter after you both have the Indian wedding ceremony in front of her parents.
