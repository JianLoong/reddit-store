Its too late to want to demand stuff and she cannot force you to have another ceremony. She has a husband and its time she was bold enough to tell her parents about the marriage then trying to pretend that you are unmarried when you meet them for the first time. Talk to her and see if she comes around or else you may have to decide on if the trip to India is worth it along with all the additional things it comes with.

They didn\u2019t want to see where she lived even virtually? Of Indian descent and while I absolutely hide things from my parents, there are limits to what a person can pull off.

As someone from the culture there is a lot of need for approval and other bigger issues at play putting her in a difficult position.

It\u2019s great. Listen to your wife anyway.", "NTA. \n- I understand not wanting to lie. This seems like your wife\u2019s issue to solve as it was her requirement initially. Wife messed up, her parents seem neutral in this as they didn\u2019t do anything\n- I would ask your wife if you can be honest with the parents while also proceeding to have a ceremony. In their eyes, you might not be married anyway.\n- This may be important for them to save face regardless of whether they know you are already married. In other words, collectively accept the idea that you are not Indian-married yet, but also do not lie\n- marriage is a symbolic act, and you are considering honoring the parents tradition and culture, that is all. It doesn\u2019t in any way nullify your existing marriage.", "NAH \n\nI can understand you not wanting to do another wedding ceremony, but your wife comes from a different culture.

She obviously still wants a relationship with them. You say your original wedding was perfect but maybe she wants more of her traditions as well. You have to show respect for your wife\u2019s customs, culture and her families beliefs. I can understand not wanting to lie but if this is what it takes to keep her happy and for her to have her family accept you (by showing you respect and accept their culture) then do it.", "NAH \n\nyou also need to accept that for her family to accept you, then you need to marry in her culture.  This will mean a multi-day celebration of marriage with all of her extended family.   \nHer family will demand it or will be dishonored.", "ESH. *You* decided it was time for you to visit her family.

Yeah, she sucks for hiding the relationship and marriage, but I can understand it.

Which you didn't do so now play pretend. The wedding will be amazing and since you already had one think of it as a party. 2nd PDA isn't acceptable anyway so you won't be able to act like her husband anyways. 3rd.it will make them all happy. 4th if they find out she was married already, they may disown her and it will bring shame to her....now thinking that the culture is wrong. Ok . But you ain't gonna change this by taking a stand. Your gonna hurt her. So play along and enjoy the ride", "NAH, but I\u2019m definitely feeling more sympathetic for her. She lied because she felt like she had no other option - she didn\u2019t want to lose you or be disowned by her family. No, it wasn\u2019t the best choice, but it was one made under a set of difficult circumstances surrounding her culture that as you acknowledge, you can\u2019t come close to understanding. Now it looks like she finally has a chance to have both, and her family accept you - something she had never thought would be possible - and you\u2019re squashing the idea.\n\nIf you want to understand her culture, please get off Reddit (because let\u2019s be real, you know damn well you\u2019re going to find a lot more people here from your culture than hers, and right now you need to be thinking about hers) and do some actual research on it. Talk to your wife. Look up other accounts of white Americans who married someone whose family was all living in India. I have a hunch doing this would show that what she\u2019s asking for here is not super rare. In cultures with such strict social norms and traditions around courting and marriage, children lying to their parents about it is pretty darn common - especially when that child has moved to the US. \n\nDoing what she wants will leave you feeling kinda gross about lying, though that feeling may change once you have an Indian wedding and visit her country. Doing what you want could end with her being disowned. Even if her parents come around, they\u2019ll still want you to have an Indian wedding, and it will still change her relationship with them. So while I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting to do this\u2026yeah, I do kinda think you\u2019ll be one if you insist on telling them the truth about how long you\u2019ve been married.", "NAH Well, I guess it's more a matter of respect for her, her family, and her culture. If you really wanted to get to know them, and learn more about her culture, then it's a no-brainer. You jump through whatever hoops you need to jump through. I think it's neat, the cultural adventure you have the opportunity to take. Good luck!", "Dude I'm just gonna be blunt and quick to the point. You need to divorce this girl now. Here are my reasons. She is treating you like a dirty secret. almost like she is using you to rebel against her parents. Si nce she knew her family would never approve of you. Then why marry you in the first place? Now she wants you to lie and say you are not married so she could have a huge Indian wedding? Just give her one for a vow renewal. But I would dump her because of how she was treating you. Not introducing you to her friends much less her family. Just run dude. I'm telling you. Get out before you have kids. Cause it ain't gonna end well", "NTA. You've already got married. That's an inescapable fact, whether her family knows about it or not. Would she expect your family and friends to fly out to attend a wedding and pretend you're still single?", "I'm probably a minority here but NAH - you're allowed to not want to lie about your relationship, but believe me Indian weddings are huge family event and a great way to experience the culture. Talk it out with your wife, there aren't any stupid rules either other than the wife stays with the family the night before the official ceremony and has a girl's and children only event a few days before.", "ESH - in my opinion, you both went into this deception together and for, as you've said, at least three years. i think it's an AH move for you to all of a sudden decide it's your righteous choice to stop deceiving your in-laws. ultimately, you are married now and if you want to remain married, these are decisions you have to make together.\n\nhaving said that, the expectations that your wife is sharing with you are deeply engrained in indian culture. i'm having a hard time understanding what your 'end game' is here - do you WANT to be accepted into her family or not? because purely based on the information you've included here, it kinda sounds like 1) you've played a role in lying to her family for years now, 2) on your own terms, you've 'decided' you just want to show up in her home country and casually reveal that you not only dated her without their knowledge, but you up and married her without ever meeting them, and 3) part of their culture are these big, beautiful, and culturally rich weddings, and you're already showing a lack of support and/or a disinterest in that. so, INFO: is your goal even to remain married and to get in the good graces of your in-laws? or just to travel to india and blow shit up in her family?", "ESH. She should\u2019ve come clean before marrying you. I think first generation immigrant kids from more traditional cultures often get comfortable lying to their families, but she took it too far\n\nAt this point, you didn\u2019t put your foot down sooner, this will help them like you and make it easier for your future kids, and give her a chance to have a wedding that represents her culture", "YTA\n\nYou need to approach her culture the way she says. You\u2019re trying to impose your culture\u2019s values as if they are correct and hers are wrong and that\u2019s really poor behaviour.\n\nGo, sleep apart, let them conduct your marriage according to their rites and enjoy not having to lie anymore.", "Hmmm I kinda think ESH, because she should have been more upfront with her family especially if she does not depend on them financially. I'm not unsympathetic because I'm Asian as well and understand some of the pressure your wife would have been under. \n\nBut also...soft YTA for you op. If a big Indian wedding is what would make all her family happy then what's the big deal to just do it? How can you claim to want to know more about her culture and want to raise your children with proud identities if you can't even do this? I do get where you are coming from, and you've been very patient to not push her on telling her family about you. But 'coming clean' etc etc and expecting them just to accept you and your wife's situations is a very western perspective and will cause problems - more likely for your wife than you. \n\nBut going forward why not just do the second 'wedding'? Sounds like you won't see them super frequently in the scope of your life if you're based in the States. Marriage is about compromise. Pick your battles - this is not the hill I would die on.", "INFO. Did you know this was coming? Did she communicate this before you got married or is she just dumping this on you now?", "NAH.  Culture and familial pressure can be quite a burden for one to carry, and she may even want a ***VERY LARGE*** and traditional Indian wedding.  Should you go through with this, it will be an amazing experience.  I'm a white guy and have been fortunate to be included in portions of a traditional wedding. Insane and an amazing cultural experience.\n\nThis type of wedding may be critical for her parents to accept the \"white guy.\"\n\nI also believe she needs to be more honest with her parents, and I also understand why it would be very, very hard.  I don't think ESH and understand how difficult this is for everyone.", "NTA. She is likely so culturally and emotionally enmeshed with her family that they are guilting her into doing things their way. You can either:\n1. Go along with the plans, even though it is lying (Lord help you if they find out!) and against YOUR culture, or\n2. Insist that you ARE married and living together, and risk having her family blow up at her, which could hurt her. Or cause her to cut them off, which may give her the impetus to commit more to the life you two are building here. \n\nYou and she need to really talk!\n\nI see no easy path here.", "YTA. You're talking about a country that still regularly reports honor killings. Listen to your wife.", "NTA. She \"broke down\" and said she can't keep this secret from her parents any longer \u2014 and yet, she wants to *continue* to keep it a secret that you two are already married \u2014 that you've been married for *a year and a half* already.\n\nWhat will happen if you travel to India with her secret intact, with the intention of meeting her family and then having a big Indian wedding, but her parents hate you and forbid her to marry you? Will she send you packing? Will she stand up to her parents? (Hint: If she's not willing or able to tell her parents the truth *now*, she will *not* be willing or able to defy them and \"marry you anyway.\")\n\nI think if she's willing to tell her parents that you're already married, and they want to hold a big cultural Indian wedding celebration as a sort of second ceremony or affirmation of your vows or something, you should be willing to go along with that, especially if her family will pick up the tab so it doesn't even cost you anything. But I agree you should be very reluctant to present yourselves to her parents as an unmarried couple wanting to get married there. I don't see how anything good can come of that.", "I think Y T A for not wanting to do another wedding considering her family would pay. Lots of couples do multiple wedding celebrations when their respective families are in different locations and/or are part of different cultures. It shouldn't take away anything from the specialness of your first wedding. Wouldn't anyone in a loving relationship love the chance to get to declare their love all over again? This would essentially have the same function as a vow renewal\n\nIt's unclear by your post which of the two of you is putting more pressure on you to visit India with her, but if it is her, then she is an Asshole as well fot expecting you to partake in a lie if she didnt make it clear when you decided to elope that she was eventually going to expect you to interact with her parents in the future and also maintain the lie.", "Are you saying the wife is TA?\n\nN T A means there is an asshole, but OP is not it. For no assholes there exists N A H (no assholes here).", "That\u2019s just a ridiculous take lacking nuance, that\u2019s obviously heavily contextual and this seems to be a situation in which pressure and culture played large roles in a decision that wasn\u2019t born out of malice. Dooming a relationship without even trying is quite literally the opposite of putting the work in to make it work.", "The Prime Ministurd has spoken.", "So OPs the AH because he doesn\u2019t want to lie about his marriage?", "They were both complicit in the lie, and she\u2019s not putting her parents comfort above her husband, she\u2019s trying to ensure her relationship survives period. It\u2019s obvious that they have a good marriage with each other but compromises are necessary when dealing with such magnitudes of social pressure.", "I agree regarding OP's obvious distaste for the Indian wedding. It's one thing to be uncomfortable with lying about marriage status. It's another to completely dismiss having the Indian wedding.\n\nWhile getting married happens once (legally speaking), weddings do not have to be once. Plenty of couples do two weddings for various reasons. For family that cannot make it to one wedding. To have the experience of doing both of the couple's dream/cultural weddings.\n\nOP is essentially refusing wife's family, who he claims he wants to get close to, to celebrate and wish wife a happy marriage.\n\nIf wife's parents/family can somehow be convinced to forgive the lying about current marital status (BIG HUGE IF), then OP should try actually getting close to wife's family by doing the Indian wedding. Or stop thinking he can get close to wife's family at all and give up pushing wife to make it work his way.", "Right.  \n\nIf this was a white guy who hid his marriage to an Indian woman from his family, then said \"you have to lie to them when you meet them, then you have to agree to go through a catholic wedding to appease them\" when she had no desire to, people would be calling him an abusive monster", "I think this, exactly. The lie has already been told. Take her lead on the best way to make it right. We don't know what revelations would completely destroy her relationship with her family, and OP needs to honor his wife's desire to make things right with them, however she sees fit as she understands the culture.\n\nLet them welcome you to the family with a celebration that in no way negates or replaces the intimate ceremony you already had.", "I doubt it. I don't think it's uncommon in marriages between people of two different cultures (especially when there is huge geographical distance as well) to have two separate celebrations for both cultures/families. The only big difference here is the lying aspect, since OP's wife doesn't want to tell her parents she was married over a year ago.", ">you both went into this deception together and for, as you've said, at least three years. i think it's an AH move for you to all of a sudden decide it's your righteous choice to stop deceiving your in-laws.\n\nI would need to know more about what the expectation OP's wife set for future interactions with her family. It could easily have been that OP was led to believe that she was never going to let her family know about OP, in which case I think it's resonable for OP to ask to not want to put any work into maintaing the deception.\n\nThough, OP seems to be the one pushing to meet her family, and so if he's not willing to meet her family under the conditions tht she has set, then she should have the right to not want him to meet her family.", "I don't think it's fair to say OP an AH for not wanting to lie about being married to his in-laws.  It's like if a gay person asked their partner to pretend to be their \"roommate\" when their parents visit.", ">If a big Indian wedding is what would make all her family happy then what's the big deal to just do it?\n\nHonest question.  If roles were reversed and this guy was like \"I know we are married, but my parents want us to have a big catholic mass at the church I grew up in\", and the wife didn't want to because she was happy with the \"perfect\" ceremony they already had, would you say she was an asshole, and saying \"what's the big deal\"", "While I agree with you, I also don't think these demands are fair.", "If being honest about the marriage means that OP's wife will be estranged from her entire family/culture and there will be massive social shame for her family, then yes, he is an AH if he won't go along with this. Sometimes we have to lie to our in-laws about stuff!! In a case with this big of a cultural difference, the lie is gonna be bigger. It's unfortunate but honesty is not always the best policy when trying to manage relationships with parents/in-laws. OP's wife could've handled this better in the beginning but she messed up and is trying to do her best to fix it now without totally destroying her relationship with her parents. Is it fair that she has to lie to them? No. But it is what it is.", "How was he complicit in the lie?  He never met the parents.  You can't lie to someone you've never met.", "The social cultural and familial pressures don\u2019t even begin to compare, you truly can\u2019t fathom what it\u2019s unlike unless you\u2019ve lived it.", "Because the white guy from the US hasn\u2019t grown up in a country with a caste system and strict rules and traditions, and the very real threat of being shunned and disowned if he doesn\u2019t follow them. This is not a situation where you can just reverse the roles and act like it\u2019s a logical comparison.", "Does he have to keep it a secret from his family and friends that he got married again?", "It\u2019s not at all like that. She\u2019s not asking OP to pretend that he\u2019s her roommate or just a friend - the parents know they\u2019re in a romantic relationship. Terrible analogy.", "If his parents were insanely conservative massively bound by social obligations and his relationship with them, his family and his entire culture depended on it and she refused yea I\u2019d say she\u2019s being the AH", "To me, the difference is because that\u2019s about religion, not culture. I know they\u2019re often linked, but they\u2019re not the same. Asking someone to have a second wedding so they can make promises to God in a Catholic Church (like promising you will have children and raise them to believe in God - yes, this is a requirement to marry in a Catholic Church) is not the same to me as wanting a second wedding celebrating Indian culture. It\u2019s very normal for mixed couples like this to have an American wedding and an Indian wedding. Not so much for having a Catholic wedding and a non-religious wedding.", "I mean, sure, I don't understand that culture because I'm not a part of it.  But conceptually, its the same thing.  You want to make your partner start a relationship with a lie, then go through an entire ceremony they don't want to go through.  Regardless, that is a shitty thing to do to someone you love", "Yes, because no one from the states has ever been shunned for marrying outside of their race/culture.  NEVER has happened even once.  As a black guy, there is no way i could ever understand that.", "The point here isn't the title of the relationship its the point of lying. In both the other partner is being asked to lie. \n\nMy point is how is someone an AH for not wanting to lie?", "Isn't there typically a religious aspect to an Indian wedding?  I've only been to one, and there definitely was then.", "That\u2019s just the thing, it\u2019s not conceptually the same thing. The context of the issue massively changes how we should view her actions. Trust me if he doesn\u2019t go through with this either what sounds like a good happy marriage will be ended in an unimaginably messy way involving inter continental war on the part of her family or she will be completely cut from not just her parents but her entire extended family, literally hundreds of people and lose the place she grew up in.", "You keep changing the dynamics to twist it around to try to get you the answer you want. First it was \u201cif a white guy did this\u201d and \u201cif it was about wanting a Catholic ceremony\u201d and now it\u2019s anyone in the US ever being shunned for marrying outside of their race/culture. It\u2019s very confusing and just keeps getting further away from OP\u2019s question and the dynamic actually happening.", "I absolutely understand the complexities race can add to marriage and relationships in the USA being a country defined by systemic racism but with all due respect comparing racism and the caste system is really not equal grounds.", "Well if that\u2019s your point, you chose a shitty analogy to make it - that was my point - that those two things are not comparable because the lie is not the same at all. There are different degrees of lies. I already typed a whole long response to OP about how I don\u2019t think either one of them is the asshole, but I am more sensitive towards her in this situation given that she\u2019s a first-gen immigrant coming from very real cultural pressure and traditions.", "He\u2019s already lying by omission. They\u2019ve been keeping their relationship a secret for three years", "There is definitely religious symbolism and there will be religious aspects to the wedding but most modern day Indian weddings are more like week long parties with considerably less focus on the religious aspect of it.", "There is, but it\u2019s not quite the same. They do pray to God - but in more of a \u201cGod, please bless this marriage\u201d kind of way rather than \u201cwe promise to be good Catholics and raise our children to believe in God and also be Catholic.\u201d As someone who was raised Catholic, this was one of the reasons I put my foot down and did not get married in church just to make my parents and grandparents happy.", "I'm not changing anything.  You are acting like an Indian person is the only one who can relate to being shunned for marrying outside of your race.  Yes, the first point I made was about religion, you then changed it to being shunned for who you married, so I responded to that.", "They are identically oppressive, for all intents and purposes. Low caste people are raped, murdered, and their possessions are taken, with impunity. Low caste people have fewer rights, fewer recourses, less educational opportunities and are taken advantage of at every turn. \n\nThe caste system *is* racism. Codified over a very long time, with appalling consequences for the people at the bottom.", "I don't feel sensitive for her.....she decided to lie to her entire family and hide the fact she was dating this guy for 3+ years. Then continue to hide it for the 6 months after they got married. \n\nBut I give a better analogy to fit than. Let's say OP family a huge Catholics who only respect marriages in a church. Would you feel bad for him that he has to lie and pretend not to be married and force his already wife to have a Catholic wedding she doesn't want. You know, because of all the cultural pressure and traditions", "There are already like three other comments asking this. You can go read the responses on one of them. Still not a good analogy."]}
