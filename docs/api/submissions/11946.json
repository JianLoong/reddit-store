Its too late to want to demand stuff and she cannot force you to have another ceremony. She has a husband and its time she was bold enough to tell her parents about the marriage then trying to pretend that you are unmarried when you meet them for the first time. Talk to her and see if she comes around or else you may have to decide on if the trip to India is worth it along with all the additional things it comes with.

In their eyes, you might not be married anyway.\n- This may be important for them to save face regardless of whether they know you are already married. In other words, collectively accept the idea that you are not Indian-married yet, but also do not lie\n- marriage is a symbolic act, and you are considering honoring the parents tradition and culture, that is all. It doesn\u2019t in any way nullify your existing marriage.", "NAH \n\nI can understand you not wanting to do another wedding ceremony, but your wife comes from a different culture.

She obviously still wants a relationship with them. You say your original wedding was perfect but maybe she wants more of her traditions as well. You have to show respect for your wife\u2019s customs, culture and her families beliefs.

Ok . But you ain't gonna change this by taking a stand. Your gonna hurt her. So play along and enjoy the ride", "NAH, but I\u2019m definitely feeling more sympathetic for her. She lied because she felt like she had no other option - she didn\u2019t want to lose you or be disowned by her family. No, it wasn\u2019t the best choice, but it was one made under a set of difficult circumstances surrounding her culture that as you acknowledge, you can\u2019t come close to understanding. Now it looks like she finally has a chance to have both, and her family accept you - something she had never thought would be possible - and you\u2019re squashing the idea.\n\nIf you want to understand her culture, please get off Reddit (because let\u2019s be real, you know damn well you\u2019re going to find a lot more people here from your culture than hers, and right now you need to be thinking about hers) and do some actual research on it. Talk to your wife. Look up other accounts of white Americans who married someone whose family was all living in India. I have a hunch doing this would show that what she\u2019s asking for here is not super rare. In cultures with such strict social norms and traditions around courting and marriage, children lying to their parents about it is pretty darn common - especially when that child has moved to the US. \n\nDoing what she wants will leave you feeling kinda gross about lying, though that feeling may change once you have an Indian wedding and visit her country. Doing what you want could end with her being disowned. Even if her parents come around, they\u2019ll still want you to have an Indian wedding, and it will still change her relationship with them. So while I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting to do this\u2026yeah, I do kinda think you\u2019ll be one if you insist on telling them the truth about how long you\u2019ve been married.", "NAH Well, I guess it's more a matter of respect for her, her family, and her culture. If you really wanted to get to know them, and learn more about her culture, then it's a no-brainer. You jump through whatever hoops you need to jump through. I think it's neat, the cultural adventure you have the opportunity to take. Good luck!", "Dude I'm just gonna be blunt and quick to the point. You need to divorce this girl now. Here are my reasons. She is treating you like a dirty secret. almost like she is using you to rebel against her parents. Si nce she knew her family would never approve of you. Then why marry you in the first place? Now she wants you to lie and say you are not married so she could have a huge Indian wedding? Just give her one for a vow renewal. But I would dump her because of how she was treating you. Not introducing you to her friends much less her family. Just run dude. I'm telling you. Get out before you have kids. Cause it ain't gonna end well", "NTA. You've already got married. That's an inescapable fact, whether her family knows about it or not. Would she expect your family and friends to fly out to attend a wedding and pretend you're still single?", "I'm probably a minority here but NAH - you're allowed to not want to lie about your relationship, but believe me Indian weddings are huge family event and a great way to experience the culture. Talk it out with your wife, there aren't any stupid rules either other than the wife stays with the family the night before the official ceremony and has a girl's and children only event a few days before.", "ESH - in my opinion, you both went into this deception together and for, as you've said, at least three years. i think it's an AH move for you to all of a sudden decide it's your righteous choice to stop deceiving your in-laws. ultimately, you are married now and if you want to remain married, these are decisions you have to make together.\n\nhaving said that, the expectations that your wife is sharing with you are deeply engrained in indian culture. i'm having a hard time understanding what your 'end game' is here - do you WANT to be accepted into her family or not? because purely based on the information you've included here, it kinda sounds like 1) you've played a role in lying to her family for years now, 2) on your own terms, you've 'decided' you just want to show up in her home country and casually reveal that you not only dated her without their knowledge, but you up and married her without ever meeting them, and 3) part of their culture are these big, beautiful, and culturally rich weddings, and you're already showing a lack of support and/or a disinterest in that. so, INFO: is your goal even to remain married and to get in the good graces of your in-laws? or just to travel to india and blow shit up in her family?", "ESH. She should\u2019ve come clean before marrying you. I think first generation immigrant kids from more traditional cultures often get comfortable lying to their families, but she took it too far\n\nAt this point, you didn\u2019t put your foot down sooner, this will help them like you and make it easier for your future kids, and give her a chance to have a wedding that represents her culture", "YTA\n\nYou need to approach her culture the way she says. You\u2019re trying to impose your culture\u2019s values as if they are correct and hers are wrong and that\u2019s really poor behaviour.\n\nGo, sleep apart, let them conduct your marriage according to their rites and enjoy not having to lie anymore.", "Hmmm I kinda think ESH, because she should have been more upfront with her family especially if she does not depend on them financially. I'm not unsympathetic because I'm Asian as well and understand some of the pressure your wife would have been under. \n\nBut also...soft YTA for you op. If a big Indian wedding is what would make all her family happy then what's the big deal to just do it? How can you claim to want to know more about her culture and want to raise your children with proud identities if you can't even do this? I do get where you are coming from, and you've been very patient to not push her on telling her family about you. But 'coming clean' etc etc and expecting them just to accept you and your wife's situations is a very western perspective and will cause problems - more likely for your wife than you. \n\nBut going forward why not just do the second 'wedding'? Sounds like you won't see them super frequently in the scope of your life if you're based in the States. Marriage is about compromise. Pick your battles - this is not the hill I would die on.", "INFO. Did you know this was coming? Did she communicate this before you got married or is she just dumping this on you now?", "NAH.  Culture and familial pressure can be quite a burden for one to carry, and she may even want a ***VERY LARGE*** and traditional Indian wedding.  Should you go through with this, it will be an amazing experience.  I'm a white guy and have been fortunate to be included in portions of a traditional wedding. Insane and an amazing cultural experience.\n\nThis type of wedding may be critical for her parents to accept the \"white guy.\"\n\nI also believe she needs to be more honest with her parents, and I also understand why it would be very, very hard.  I don't think everyone stinks and understand how difficult this is for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: fixed for bot", "NTA. She is likely so culturally and emotionally enmeshed with her family that they are guilting her into doing things their way. You can either:\n1. Go along with the plans, even though it is lying (Lord help you if they find out!) and against YOUR culture, or\n2. Insist that you ARE married and living together, and risk having her family blow up at her, which could hurt her. Or cause her to cut them off, which may give her the impetus to commit more to the life you two are building here. \n\nYou and she need to really talk!\n\nI see no easy path here.", "YTA. You're talking about a country that still regularly reports honor killings. Listen to your wife.", "NTA. She \"broke down\" and said she can't keep this secret from her parents any longer \u2014 and yet, she wants to *continue* to keep it a secret that you two are already married \u2014 that you've been married for *a year and a half* already.\n\nWhat will happen if you travel to India with her secret intact, with the intention of meeting her family and then having a big Indian wedding, but her parents hate you and forbid her to marry you? Will she send you packing? Will she stand up to her parents? (Hint: If she's not willing or able to tell her parents the truth *now*, she will *not* be willing or able to defy them and \"marry you anyway.\")\n\nI think if she's willing to tell her parents that you're already married, and they want to hold a big cultural Indian wedding celebration as a sort of second ceremony or affirmation of your vows or something, you should be willing to go along with that, especially if her family will pick up the tab so it doesn't even cost you anything. But I agree you should be very reluctant to present yourselves to her parents as an unmarried couple wanting to get married there. I don't see how anything good can come of that.", "I think Y T A for not wanting to do another wedding considering her family would pay. Lots of couples do multiple wedding celebrations when their respective families are in different locations and/or are part of different cultures. It shouldn't take away anything from the specialness of your first wedding. Wouldn't anyone in a loving relationship love the chance to get to declare their love all over again? This would essentially have the same function as a vow renewal\n\nIt's unclear by your post which of the two of you is putting more pressure on you to visit India with her, but if it is her, then she is an Asshole as well fot expecting you to partake in a lie if she didnt make it clear when you decided to elope that she was eventually going to expect you to interact with her parents in the future and also maintain the lie.", "Are you saying the wife is TA?\n\nN T A means there is an asshole, but OP is not it. For no assholes there exists N A H (no assholes here).", "That\u2019s just a ridiculous take lacking nuance, that\u2019s obviously heavily contextual and this seems to be a situation in which pressure and culture played large roles in a decision that wasn\u2019t born out of malice.

It\u2019s obvious that they have a good marriage with each other but compromises are necessary when dealing with such magnitudes of social pressure.", "I agree regarding OP's obvious distaste for the Indian wedding. It's one thing to be uncomfortable with lying about marriage status. It's another to completely dismiss having the Indian wedding.\n\nWhile getting married happens once (legally speaking), weddings do not have to be once. Plenty of couples do two weddings for various reasons. For family that cannot make it to one wedding. To have the experience of doing both of the couple's dream/cultural weddings.\n\nOP is essentially refusing wife's family, who he claims he wants to get close to, to celebrate and wish wife a happy marriage.\n\nIf wife's parents/family can somehow be convinced to forgive the lying about current marital status (BIG HUGE IF), then OP should try actually getting close to wife's family by doing the Indian wedding. Or stop thinking he can get close to wife's family at all and give up pushing wife to make it work his way.", "Right.  \n\nIf this was a white guy who hid his marriage to an Indian woman from his family, then said \"you have to lie to them when you meet them, then you have to agree to go through a catholic wedding to appease them\" when she had no desire to, people would be calling him an abusive monster", "I think this, exactly. The lie has already been told. Take her lead on the best way to make it right.

I don't think it's uncommon in marriages between people of two different cultures (especially when there is huge geographical distance as well) to have two separate celebrations for both cultures/families. The only big difference here is the lying aspect, since OP's wife doesn't want to tell her parents she was married over a year ago.", ">you both went into this deception together and for, as you've said, at least three years. i think it's an AH move for you to all of a sudden decide it's your righteous choice to stop deceiving your in-laws.\n\nI would need to know more about what the expectation OP's wife set for future interactions with her family. It could easily have been that OP was led to believe that she was never going to let her family know about OP, in which case I think it's resonable for OP to ask to not want to put any work into maintaing the deception.\n\nThough, OP seems to be the one pushing to meet her family, and so if he's not willing to meet her family under the conditions tht she has set, then she should have the right to not want him to meet her family.", "I don't think it's fair to say OP an AH for not wanting to lie about being married to his in-laws.

If roles were reversed and this guy was like \"I know we are married, but my parents want us to have a big catholic mass at the church I grew up in\", and the wife didn't want to because she was happy with the \"perfect\" ceremony they already had, would you say she was an asshole, and saying \"what's the big deal\"", "While I agree with you, I also don't think these demands are fair.", "If being honest about the marriage means that OP's wife will be estranged from her entire family/culture and there will be massive social shame for her family, then yes, he is an AH if he won't go along with this. Sometimes we have to lie to our in-laws about stuff!! In a case with this big of a cultural difference, the lie is gonna be bigger. It's unfortunate but honesty is not always the best policy when trying to manage relationships with parents/in-laws. OP's wife could've handled this better in the beginning but she messed up and is trying to do her best to fix it now without totally destroying her relationship with her parents.

Terrible analogy.", "If his parents were insanely conservative massively bound by social obligations and his relationship with them, his family and his entire culture depended on it and she refused yea I\u2019d say she\u2019s being the AH", "To me, the difference is because that\u2019s about religion, not culture. I know they\u2019re often linked, but they\u2019re not the same. Asking someone to have a second wedding so they can make promises to God in a Catholic Church (like promising you will have children and raise them to believe in God - yes, this is a requirement to marry in a Catholic Church) is not the same to me as wanting a second wedding celebrating Indian culture.

In both the other partner is being asked to lie. \n\nMy point is how is someone an AH for not wanting to lie?", "Isn't there typically a religious aspect to an Indian wedding?  I've only been to one, and there definitely was then.", "That\u2019s just the thing, it\u2019s not conceptually the same thing. The context of the issue massively changes how we should view her actions. Trust me if he doesn\u2019t go through with this either what sounds like a good happy marriage will be ended in an unimaginably messy way involving inter continental war on the part of her family or she will be completely cut from not just her parents but her entire extended family, literally hundreds of people and lose the place she grew up in.", "You keep changing the dynamics to twist it around to try to get you the answer you want.

There are different degrees of lies.

You are acting like an Indian person is the only one who can relate to being shunned for marrying outside of your race.  Yes, the first point I made was about religion, you then changed it to being shunned for who you married, so I responded to that.", "They are identically oppressive, for all intents and purposes. Low caste people are raped, murdered, and their possessions are taken, with impunity.

Honestly it's a wonderful way to celebrate your shared culture and an excellent way to learn as much about your wife's culture as she has yours.

If you reveal this to her family, you will ruin her family's reputation to all her relatives, maybe her entire village, you will wreck their acceptance of you and of your wife if you decide to be blindly \"honest about everything\". You risk her and her family being ostracized back in her country. Do you want this all on your head? Be considerate, suck it up, do the lengthy indian wedding, pretend for your wife's sake.

I'd respect it. I know you've been married for 1.5 years but if that allows her family to accept you in the family, it isn't a high cost. I'd want all this in the open before having kids.

There will be family there for you too. Now you make them all complicit in the lie if you all are not honest. And yet, that is a huge lie given the cultural situation and traditions.  \n\nYou and your wife need together to have this discussion after you do research on what that wedding would like.

Even more so, how will you keep it up in front of 200+ people for a week+ during the Indian wedding ceremony. Your wife needs to put her big girl clothes on and resolve this one way or another, cause this lie will do her in soon enough (mentally).\n\nJust like your wife, you need to man up as well. You do not sound like an AH, OP, but you will be one also if you do not change your view about the marriage ceremony.

They share some similar views/culture so maybe I can give insight. \n\nI dated my husband for 1.5 years before he even told his parents about me. 3 months later I had to meet them and they basically grilled me about my relationship with my husband was. The thing is in these countries, they still do arranged marriages. They actually look down on love marriages. Plus it is very very common for family to disown someone if they marry someone outside their race/religion. What we know in our lives is not like what their culture knows. Our way of life is very foreign to them, just like theirs is foreign to us. You probably will never truly understand it. \n\nWhen your wife sat you down and explained everything to you that would potentially happen, it\u2019s because she wants her family to accept you and your relationship.

She is coming up with the plan because she doesn\u2019t want any of that to happen. \n\nI give the ruling of ESH because it sucks as the white person to even be put in this situation. She should have done this before you even got married. But she\u2019s doing what she thinks is right because she knows her family and the culture. Trust me, just go along with it. It will really hurt your wife if her family disowns her. I know it can be degrading but it\u2019s honestly something that you just have to deal with as the outsider.

It is a complicated one because of the cultures. But have you asked her whether a) she feels married.

Pandemic messed up a lot of things and made people settle.\n\nTrying viewing it not as a remarriage but as a celebration of your bond in front of her wider family.

Hundreds of people are invited and if her family is Hindu, it\u2019s actually required that people get married. \n2. Marriage outside of caste is a big deal.

Did you ever consider that if you're intending to raise your kids in both cultures, maybe you should get married in ways that respect both cultures? That maybe YOU considered the previous ceremony perfect, but that your wife might consider an INDIAN wedding ceremony to be perfect?

This is her showing you.  I would ask her to clarify what it means for you to not pretend you are married.  Does that mean you can't share a room?  Can't hold hands?  Can't kiss her hello/goodbye?  You don't know them, you may want to tell the truth, but perhaps the white lie is the better choice here.  She is going to know that better than you.  She may have been dreaming about a wedding that expressed her culture, and this is her chance to do that.  \n\nEven if she wasn't from a different culture and country, you could not dictate what the best way would be to interact with her family because of what is more comfortable for you.  There is plenty of variation within American culture in individual families regarding what is acceptable/expected.  Some parents don't want their kids to share a room with their partner when they come visit, even if they are adults, some don't care.  Sometimes the former means the kids get a hotel room instead.

She CAN tell the truth. She DOES have a choice. She just doesn't want to deal with anything. All she's doing is punting the same challenge down the road.\n\nWHY can't she tell the truth? She managed to date, marry, and live with a gringo over the past 4.5 years without any interference from her family. Now that she is married to you and living permanently in the States, WHAT will happen if she tells them the truth??? Not one thing that will change the life she has built with you. She spent the last 4 years not telling her parents/family a single true thing about her life. They now know she's fallen for a non-Indian and have started to be OK with that. Yes, coming clean about her long-term lie will be an even bigger shock and harder for them to learn about their daughter. They could even not want to talk to her for a while. And, frankly, she deserves that! But they will, in all likelihood, still love her and find a way to forgive her and still have a relationship with her - one where she has no need or excuse to lie about her life.\n\nQ.

Would you really object based solely on the fact that you had a wedding 1.5 years ago?\n\nIf you are really wanting to embrace your wife's culture, then that includes big, large, noisy, celebrations and family events. Whether you two have a second wedding (which BTW, lots of folks do when they bring two different cultural traditions together) - that is not the big decision here. The big decision is whether you wife is going to ever learn to stop lying to avoid challenging moments with her family and how you want to handle whatever she chooses to do.\n\nIt sounds like the trip conversation is just between you two right now.

If you look into Indian culture, you might see why she's been hesitant to bring you home to meet her family. She said she has no choice, but married you anyway.  Why not celebrate your union again?", "YTA\n\nPart of marriage is the symbiotic union of family. Yours and hers. You're basically wanting to toss out her culture. If you both had been upfront to start with, you most likely would have still been asked to have the large Indian wedding in addition to your traditional American wedding. You need to respect the customs of the place your wife was raised in. If you can't do that, then maybe you shouldn't be married to her. \n\nNow, I don't agree that lying was the best answer to this to start with. It's definitely not the answer now either. At some point, one of you would slip up and reveal your real anniversary date. May as well bite the bullet and get it over with sooner rather than later. You can't control their reaction but respect is earned. You won't earn it by lying, especially if it comes out later. \n\nMarriage is about compromise. You should try those shoes on and stop making this about what you want and start listening to the woman you vowed to love and honor. Nothing at all honorable by invalidating her culture or denying her family their happy wedding. \n\nSuck it up.", "YTA", "YTA. You agreed to date someone who you knew would have an unaccepting family. \n\nShe can't control this, traditional families can be really difficult. Your reasonings to not have another wedding are so insignificant compared to hers. You just don't want to, but she needs to.", "I dont think you are an ass hole but i do feel like maybe you are reading into things too much. I feel like having a second ceremony isnt a big deal and of course it doesnt feel good to lie but you arent hurting anyone by saying you arent married. If it really is important to do things that way in her family who you are so eager to meet then i think you should try it", "I think YTA if you push this, and the right thing *for now* is to back off and just not meet the family at all any time soon.  Just wait until she's ready to tell them what's going on without lies.\n\nThat is: I think YTA *if you make the trip at all* right now.\n\nEDIT: What if she's never able to tell them without lies?  Well, if it were me in your situation, then I'd never meet them.  I'd be sad about it, but I'd rather that than lie.", "Yall are already married. Just think of it as a party bro. I don't think you're the AH but it's a weird hill to die on like some of the others here have stated", "YTA. I mean, there\u2019s really no cost to you, and it would reunite her with her family. Seems like an easy thing to do for your wife, rather than ruining her whole family life.", "Meh. It\u2019s not a big compromise despite Indian weddings being severely over the top. It also shows you respect her culture and your in laws. \n\nAbout the only thing you are right on is being up front that you are technically already married. \n\nCan\u2019t really call you an @sshole but you aren\u2019t necessarily innocent either.", "YTA. \u201c For better or worse\u201d remember that part. Support your wife and do this for her. Suffocate your \u201cwant\u201d to \u201cnot lie\u201d because you already have been.

Her family needs face.", "> I also dont want to have another wedding ceremony \n\nWhy not? You've never had an Indian wedding ceremony and it's important to your wife and in-laws. What's so bad? The food, the dancing, the outfits? I understand not wanting to lie to them, but you also probably shouldn't have eloped. Your wife is a bright person, just follow her lead and enjoy your 2nd ceremony. NAH", "Yikes NAH. Coming from an Asian, I understand her struggle and why she lied.\n\nTelling the truth to them wouldn't just result in her parents being upset and then forgiving her, she would likely be slut shamed, berated, and dragged through the mud for her whole community to know.\n\nDo you want her to go through that?", "Just go with it and enjoy a second wedding. You don\u2019t, you\u2019ll prob be divorced", "NAH,  i can understand your thought but also hers.  Some cultures take honor very seriously and things can end poorly.  If you want to be accepted you should reconsider.   Ask some question, have more of a conversation about this.", "My brother and his wife got married in Europe. A few months later they had a second ceremony for her family back home (south east Asia). It's totally normal to have two ceremonies when you have family on different countries, and certainly with different cultures. OP wants to know more about his wife's culture, this is one way to do that.", "My sister (we're of SEA descent) married a 'white guy' and the cultural ceremony was very important in getting my extended family to accept her husband.

Generally, he respects her.", "I\u2019m in Canada and one of my friends is Indian and he couldn\u2019t even tell his parents when he got married to another Indian girl simply because she was from a different caste. We weren\u2019t even allowed to post anything about them or their wedding on social media because they were so worried it would get back to their families. \n\nIt seems extreme for us in North America but, like you said, this is something that a lot of people deal with still.", "Edit your comment so the bot doesn\u2019t count the e s h \n\nHard agree though. Culture is important but so I are his feelings and convictions about the situation", "He says he wants to understand the culture so they can raise their kids in both cultures. But he obviously doesn't if he isn't even willing to learn WHY this is so important to his wife and her family.\n\nActions speak much louder OP. You are SHOWING you wife you don't care about her culture.", "Yeah as an Indian she will be disowned if she told her parents that she is already married and didn't invited her parents.", "This is really the best response on here.

The lady will forever continue to make unreasonable demands to please her family if he gives in this time.", "Also- side note- I\u2019d be pissing my pants with excitement to get a free Indian wedding!!! Those are BOMB", "I'm just worried because there are a lot of honor killings in that region and well.. this may not end well. \n\nplease be safe.", "Yeah, it was only to get health insurance. They didn't \"act\" (be intimate) like a married couple until the Indian wedding.", "I'm the whitest crayon in the box, but related to this - it felt kind of off to me when he said they had a ceremony that was perfect as far as he was concerned. And I can only assume that it was more or less a standard American ceremony and not a full-fledged Indian one. Like maybe she secretly *wants* the full Indian ceremony and party? \n\nWhich I wouldn't blame her because Indian weddings are MAGNIFICENT. I happened to stay in a hotel where an Indian wedding party was staying as well and holy shit, when I came down once in the elevator and walked out into a sea of ladies dressed for part of the wedding... wow. One of the most beautiful scenes I have ever witnessed.", "this is the answer and if you know you know\u2026all these comments saying otherwise do not understand southeast asian culture. for her family to be open to meeting him is a big step and if he needs to try harder to compromise for her.", "Nothing says wonderful like \"If we don't perpetuate this entirely unnecessary lie about the most important event in our relationship, I'm 100% guaranteed to be disowned and shunned by the people who call themselves my family.\"", "I'd say most of that doesn't really need to happen, as their first wedding was an elopement? All they have to do is a partial truth - we had a small ceremony in America with my family, and a big ceremony in India with her family. Most wedding photos other family members hang up don't come with dates and I've not really been in a \"I see this cute photo, what is the exact date it happened\" situation, they'd probably at most ask \"ah so your small American ceremony was cute, did you have fun?\" \n\nHe's getting plenty of good advice here, but it's a risk you take when you date and marry someone from a different culture. Would OP have been okay holding off for extra years, when most of their relationship up until she told her parents she was dating a white guy was her slowly dragging her parents towards the idea of accepting a foreigner of a different caste? It seems like he was fine lying and he thinks his family should be \"good enough\" for her, when she has the cultural and emotional ties to her family in India. She's not Westernized. \n\nI'd argue that OP should read specifically the advice and comments from those with Indian families or who grew up with a similar culture. It's very possible had she not spent the lead-up softening her parents to white people before saying she was dating OP, they would have disowned her and cut her off from all the family. And with the closeness and care for family she has, that would be very painful. OP's family is probably fantastic, but the idea of \"my family should be good enough for both of us\" can come off as selfish, especially when she cared enough to get them to accept OP, as long as it took. \n\nHell, he probably doesn't even have to change much about how he acts. Say \"I love her so much it's like our hearts are already married\" and other sappy stuff. Get spoiled by her family. Get all dressed up, have a big party celebrating your love, eat delicious food. \n\nNAH for me, mostly because culturally I cannot hold her to Western standards, and knowing Indian culture and the work she was likely putting in to get to this point, I completely understand why she felt the need to lie.", "Then she shouldn't have kept it all a secret for so long. She literally did all this to herself.", "Except OP is the one pushing to visit. Wife laid out what would need to happen for them to be able to visit. Wife may have been planning to stay extremely low contact with her family in India. Who knows if she was ever planning on going back (as other commenters have said, the worst case scenario is extended family literally killing her and maybe OP). \n\nThey've been together almost 5 years and OP is just now pushing to meet her family.

I hate it when people don\u2019t understand that I don\u2019t need my parents to know everything about my life. I don\u2019t need to be honest with them. I don\u2019t get it when people are eager for drama that involves being disinherited and completely rejected for no material reason, just a vague value of honesty, especially because NOBODY is honest all the time. I don\u2019t need my parents actively in my life so it\u2019s not like I ask people to act for them. I care about my partners.

OP was naive for whatever reason, but as PoC in the US, if someone is not willing to introduce me to their family then the flags are going off.

Because that seems likely to blow up in their faces.\n\nOP, you're between a rock and a hard place.

If you insist on being truthful for your own sake, you might even get called selfish by most people.\n\nYou definitely would be TA in the Indian cultural context.", "Do u know that there are a lot of cases in India of families murdering their daughters and the persons they date if they are of different caste or religion, in the name of honor?. Please search for 'honor killing in India'. I don't know if your wife's situation is similar to this. But I think you will feel a lot different after reading the news, about your 'wife's lying'.", "YTA\n\nDude, you lied thru omission by not telling the in laws and inviting them to the first wedding. You\u2019ve already being deceptive to them. Clearly you were okay with it in the beginning, so I hardly see the difference. This is part of your wife\u2019s culture and family values, and you\u2019re now married into that", "As an Indian living in India, I can tell you coming clean now, a year after you got married will end only in tears and mayhem. Especially as they seem rather strict. Best to just go with a round of parties, which is what it would amount to. Indian parents forgive most things once they have a grandchild!\nYTA.", "YTA and your wife told you about this issue at the beginning of your relationship. Don\u2019t try and start drama when you yourself have stated you aren\u2019t the most knowledgeable about her culture.", "ESH.   I kinda understand her actions because of cultural differences, but in the long run,  lying will usually bite you on the arse.\n\nIt's done,  stop whining and get it fixed.   It's not going to kill you to help your wife out and have another ceremony.  \n\nGet over yourself  - it's not just about you.", "You've already been complicit in that lie. While I understand not wanting to continue it, you and your wife both have to be able to live with whatever happens, even if it's not exactly what you want. And it sounds like your marriage isn't going to work long term without this, so you're going to have to decide whether another wedding ceremony or a divorce is a better option for you, since it may very well come down to that. Honestly, ESH for not addressing this earlier.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nI think your position is understandable, but expresses a significant cultural blindness.\n\nThink about it this way: You say you want to meet her family and know her culture, but your plan is to drop in there and announce you've already married (and in their view, basically stolen and defiled) their daughter. How do you think that's going to go? Do you think that's sensitive to the cultural pressures your wife's under?\n\nVersus: you go there, you meet the people, you let the wedding take its course, you learn a ton about her family and her culture and let them do what they have to in order to embrace you as a family member.\n\nThis is a no-brainer.", "YTA for how you phrase it. You want to have your cake and eat it too. I\u2019m really glad you want to learn her culture and support your future children\u2019s culture. This means you need to follow your wife\u2019s instructions though or you won\u2019t have the chance to know her family or culture. \n\nShe is likely running the risk of getting disinherited. You don\u2019t understand how this culture works so you meed to choose whether you can accept having an Indian wedding. Maybe according to her parents ya probably haven\u2019t really gotten married yet according to their customs. Idk but YTA here because you have the white privilege and none of the cultural understanding.", "OP, just do it. I'm Indian and I was terrified to tell my parents that I'm dating a guy of another caste. Same religion, same race. Just a different caste. People are insanely rigid about stuff like this. If you tell them that you're already married, they will likely ostracize her for life. Yes, it's that kind of a big deal.\n\nLike you said, you don't understand the culture much. Just go with the \"protocol\" because the lying has already been done. This is the fixing part and one wrong move can be awful. She will choose you over her family if it comes to that but do you really want to put your wife in that position?", "I don't think anyone is the asshole here but I do recommend you agree to your wife's conditions. Speaking a man in an interracial relationship myself, your partner knows their family and culture well and you've gotta trust if she has conditions it's for a reason. Plus it's not worth risking an argument or jeopardizing your relationship. That's just my opinion ofc, you might feel different.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re being very idealistic. Sure, lying is wrong, but it\u2019s not black and white like that. When y\u2019all got married and didn\u2019t even mention it to her family, that is a lie by omission that you went along with. Now she is trying to introduce you in a way that won\u2019t get her disowned by her entire family. It could be uncomfortable for you, but you dug your own hole when you went along with never meeting her parents or inviting them to the wedding during the years that you were dating. \n\nI\u2019d say suck it up and do this for your wife.", "And to add, it's very likely she may be disowned and shunned if they found out their daughter married without them know, let alone to someone outside their culture.", "This is an excellent balance of being honest without volunteering unnecessary details.", "COMPLETELY normal. All my friends who have gotten married have had a wedding in the States, then a wedding in India. That was the plan for my husband and I as well, but we're both military so travel plans got complicated and then COVID hit.", "South Asian, not SE.", "Yeah, this is more like saying, \"I know we got married in NYC with a justice of the peace and our friends, but my huge Midwestern family wants to throw us a giant wedding with all their friends and family and a backyard bbq with hotdish\" and someone digging in their heels. Reddit would also, in that circumstance, call the person refusing an asshole.", "Yeah I'm kind of surprised by the comments on here.  Like...this isn't a lie for \"just one (fake wedding) day\".  This is a lie you will be telling for the rest of your life.  Are you gonna have two anniversaries?  One that's done quietly and one that's public, but less meaningful for you?  Are you gonna have to shush any comments made by family/friends that are \"in the know\" to prevent her family from finding out?\n\nAnd when they find out, because OF COURSE they will find out, you will catch a lot of the blame for it.  [Source: my friend had a \"secret marriage\".  The secret lasted a year. And that was BEFORE social media was a thing.]\n\nAlso....the reason you're having to lie in the first place is because....you're marrying into a family that would have hated you for your race and class.  Yeah, it's nice that they're opening up to you, and I think you should encourage that, but let's not forget the WHY behind this lie.  \n\nBecause it absolutely will be a lie. This is not \"just a second party.\"  This is a script you will have to play together for the rest of your married lives.", "Maybe not honor killing, but there can still be severe repercussions. Getting cut out of the family, for one. My uncle sent his daughter over to do her Master's and disowned her when she said she wanted to stay an extra year. They haven't spoken in years which is pretty devastating when you have nobody left. My cousin at least has my family and a couple other of our cousins but OP's wife might not.", "My sister tells my mom she smokes weed and they have weeks long drama at a time about it. Why tho???", "Oh ok its not racism its bigotry cranked to 11 that makes it better.", "Why not? It\u2019s a cultural meeting point, and why does the non-western point of view get to dictate how a western person is treated. No.", "THANK YOU! brown girl married to a white guy. while we didn't have to go overseas or have a massive south asian wedding, there were definitely quite a few hoops he jumped through (including pretend religiousness - which in all fairness I also had to do with his family). but he did them willingly, because, while i'm sure he does not really understand south asian culture (and i am very americanized so no real need) he respects and understands when i look at the situation and say hey - this is really the best (and honestly only) way for this to go. the juice is really not worth the squeeze with this - just go have the party and call it a day, jeeze.", "YTA \"I don't want to lie to them about our lives\"......but you have been and have had her lie to them too for over a year now about being married to you and y'all's relationship so I wouldn't be so quick to say \"well I wanna be Mr.Honesty man now\" because that ship has sailed", "I m an Indian woman and i think she should have grown a backbone long long ago. Her parents did send her to another country for higher education and she also started working there. So they are obviously not that regressive in all areas. She was financially independent she should have told them about you. But for whatever reasons she is doing things somewhat backwards. Just go with the flow now. And enjoy your indian wedding. NAH", "Yta. It was perfect to you because all of YOUR  family was there. Let her have that special day with her family too. Refusing will start your relationship off with her family on a bad note.", "Try dealing with traditional Jewish families and intermarriage. Liberal Jewish families tend to be a lot more tolerant and accepting, but there are traditional/orthodox families that will disown a child for marrying outside their faith. There are still orthodox communities who have arranged marriages. They worry about their children marrying non-orthodox Jews. I totally understand where OP\u2019s wife is coming from. OP needs to let her take the lead and do whatever she needs him to do. I grew up in an observant but not orthodox family. I kept within the community in regards to dating and marriage. I saw the animosity towards those who did otherwise. I\u2019m guessing that the Jewish community is not alone in this. Thankfully, the non orthodox community has taken a very different approach to intermarriage.", "> having two receptions (one in America and one back home) is super normal for South Asian immigrants! \n\nEven minus the \"hidden relationship\" part of this post, whenever people from different countries marry each other, isn't it common to have at least 2 wedding ceremonies? \n\nLike I have Vietnamese friend who married a British guy, and they had one wedding in Vietnam for her side of the family, and another in the UK for his family. If they had just had one wedding ceremony, that means one side of the family has to miss out because they can't afford to fly all the way across the world to attend. So having 2 ceremonies meant both family can take part in the celebrations. Just seems like common sense to me.", "Easy fix - arrange for the second wedding to occur on the same date as the first one.  That way, there's only one day / month combo to remember, and if needed, it's not hard to fudge the years a bit.", "\"Mabey I misunderstood something\" this. This right here. What your not understanding (through no fault of your own mind you) is her culture. As you said you want to be a part of it, well, step one would be following the lead of the woman you love who obviously has a far deeper understanding of what the appropriate course of acrion should be. YTA, but you dont have to be.", "Coming from a non white culture if your wedding wasn\u2019t anywhere on social media and this can\u2019t be exposed easily later please lie. Help your wife you have no idea what it took for her to keep this from her parents. Enjoy another celebration, it will be fun!", "Indian wife here (as in married to one). Please understand that many (emphatically not all) Indian parents are fucked up. Period. Hypocritical, judgemental and full of shit. The fact the girl had to elope proves it. And don't get me started on casteism. That is a bigger load of horse shit than racism yet it's alive and well in India. \nSo, OP. NTA. Her parents should be happy their daughter married white and they don't have to pay dowry. \nMy advice - you can humor her maybe... But both of you can stay in a nice hotel. Together. Make some excuse... Say you go in the winter and they have no heat in their house.\nYou are not bound to suck her parents cock.", "I may reword what I put because this makes much more sense.", "That jumped out at me too. He thinks it was perfect because he got everything he wanted, and now he's trying to direct how she manages her relationship with her own family.\n\nI come from an Irish Catholic family and my dad had very strong ideas about what weddings are supposed to be like. I married an atheist so even if we wanted to, we couldn't get married in the church. We had lovely outdoor wedding, which I knew would piss off my dad, but I was braced for it and prepared to cut contact if needed.\n\nWhen my oldest brother got married, Dad got drunk and made a speech about his kids. He forgot to mention the groom. From that point on I decided there was no way I'd let him dictate my wedding and then humiliate me in front of guests. But the fact that things were already tense and strained made that an easy decision for me", "This is so underrated", "Absolutely the last paragraph too. If OP doesn't have the wedding in India his wife's family will NEVER trust or like him. It's just how it is in traditional cultures. My bio culture is the same, my bio family very much expect me to have a second wedding in the DR and they expect it to be super traditional and my fiance agreed because it's a way to maintain peace between families that don't practice the same cultural activities.", "I\u2019d be shocked if he just doesn\u2019t want to do the ceremony and by not meeting one of her requests, he\u2019s getting out of it."]}
