The mall is usually PACKED on the weekend so I was driving around for a good 5+ minutes trying to find parking. I was driving through a row  of parking spots and finally saw an open one. When I glanced at the spot there was a man standing partially in the spot on his phone, but then he began walking away. So I started turning into the spot and all of a sudden someone starts literally banging on my tailgate (trunk) and yelling \"HEY HEY\". \n\nSo at this point I'm pissed because why is some random stranger banging on my car? So I roll down my window and the person comes up to my door, and I recognize it's the guy who was just partially standing in the spot. \n\nI was like \"can I help you\" and he starts going off on my saying how he was saving this spot for his friend, and just walked away for a couple seconds so wave him down.\n\nWhen he stopped me I was already halfway into the spot. And also this mall was BUSY, so I'm not sure if maybe this was his first time here or what? But you cannot \"stand in a parking spot\" to save it and then walk away for a couple of seconds and not think anyone is going to take it like wtf.\n\nSo I said exactly that to him \"look sorry man but you can't stand in a parking spot to save it or someone and leave it unattended for a couple of seconds in a busy ass mall parking lot.\"\n\nHe started going off on my and cussing me out telling me to \"GET THE HELL OUT OF MY SPOT\" over and over again. I said back to him \"no I'm not moving\" \n\nThen some other random ass guy came beside him and started yelling at me to move as well, who I'm assuming was the person he was holding the spot for. Any way it was this huge ass scene. I rolled my window up and began fully parking in the spot and these two guys proceeded to RUN IN FRONT OF MY CAR and start banging on the hood of it still yelling \"HEY HEY GET THE HELL OUT MOVE\".\n\nObviously people in the parking lot saw this huge scene and thankfully this man and his son came over and started telling the guys to get the hell out of here before they call the cops. \n\nThankfully they both ended up giving up and getting in the one guys car to presume find another spot. I thanked the man and his son and went into the mall. Later on in the day I was on the phone with my mom and I told her what happened. She started going off on my saying that's such an AH move and that I didn't have to make some huge scene and could've just found another spot. What if they were in a rush or something, since I wasn't in a rush etc. I disagreed. Was this an AH move? \n\nLike I just don't think it's socially acceptable to stand in a parking spot to hold it, but idk maybe it is a common thing to do and I'm just an AH?", "created_utc": 1674051821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f8kw4/aita_for_parking_in_a_parking_spot_someone_was/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Woman was standing in the spot looking at her phone and we just assumed she was walking in and got a message or something. We started to pull in and she pulled the same crap. Didn\u2019t hit the car or anything, but got super snotty. We told her no car, no spot and to move along. She asked it we were going to hit her if she didn\u2019t move and we said no, we\u2019ll just sit here half in the spot so good luck to your friend using it. She realized she couldn\u2019t win so she called me a name and moved along. During this whole discussion said friend never showed, so who knows if they were even nearby!\n\nEdit to add NTA!", "NTA", "I used to work at a large public beach that also held concerts, we would constantly have to deal with people holding spot for their friends and would end up closing the lot when it would be close to capacity, in the end we would end up just telling the spot holders off and put a random in their \"friends spot\". Then hour or so later their friend would show up and be like , my friend got me a spot and we'd say sorry lots full. NTA", "Nta, but you took a huge risk they would come back and vandalize your car once you parked it", "NTA - you can't save parking spots for people by standing in it, that's absurd! I would have taken a picture of the guy's license plate in case they damaged your car. The nerve on some people", "NTA,  holding spots like that isn't allowed.  First come, first serve.", "NTA. You can\u2019t save spots at all. That is really entitled people doing that. Also what the heck with your mom? What kind of rush could someone have going to the mall? That\u2019s a dumb thing to say.", "NTA.  Everyone knows that it is not okay to hold a parking space.  Also not okay to hit your car.  If these people were in a rush, they just need to walk faster.  Glad someone actually stopped to help you.", "\"what if they were in a rush\" lol what if, mom, what if....\n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn't make a scene: you parked your car. They were the ones screaming at you and banging on your car.", "NTA. You can\u2019t reserve public parking spaces by standing in them.", "You are nta.  Your mom is a colossal ahole.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t make a scene, those assholes did. :)", "Nta if they were in a rush the other friend could have jump out grab what needed to be gotten. But that wasn't the case. You can't save spots.", "NTA you cant save a spot.  I should know I tried this move a few years ago and I was almost hit by the AH pulling in.  We were both being AH that day, he for trying to run me over as I was already standing there and me for standing there.\n\nYou were right, next time someone starts like that call the cops.", "NTA you can't save and set aside a public parking spot. First come first serve.", "MASSIVE NTA, thank god they didn't try to attack you, If you don't have one already i'd get a dashcam", "I would have started recording the second they started hitting my car.", "NTA. I can't tell you how many times in a busy parking lot I've spotted a spot in the next row over, gone around, adn BAM someone else took it. Oh well. that's how it works. Saving a spot isn't cool or right. Not fair to everyone else.", "People will still try. \n\nI had a friend stand in a parking spot when it was super busy to hold it for another friend. I had to walk away because I was so embarrassed.", "They're counting on other people being non-confrontational and allowing it.  Fuck 'em.\n\nGood on op for not putting up with their bullshit.", "I'm old school and \"calling\" a parking spot like the OP encountered is honored only if there are alternate spots available.\n\nThe old school attitude is \"if you want to reserve a parking spot, put your car in it.\"\n\nDon't blame it on old school. There have been assholes as long as there's been school (of any age). And the OP encountered one. NTA.", "This could lead to fights and there could be injuries", "Actually, they started installing at malls premium parking spots that you pay if you need immediate parking. Avoids employing people saving parking spots.", "Yes. If they were in a rush, then instead of trying to save a space, the non-driver would have been running into the mall to take care of whatever was urgent.", "No", "Um I didn't know \"what was up\" when I was turning into the spot. The guy was partially in the spot on his phone and then started walking away. The spot was empty so I pulled in.", "I agree. Esh", "Yeah I was thinking about investing in one of those. \n\nI had pepper spray on me though and already told myself that if when I got out of my car if one of these guys got in my face or something I was going to use it.", "I grew up in the Philadelphia area, the old-school attitude there is if I put something (anything) in this spot, it's mine and you'll have to run me over to get it! lol.   \n\n\nBut you're right, there is a difference between old school and assholes for sure!", "Or stop them...that's the point of security staff.", "Even if the guy was obviously reserving the space, he had no right to do so. The only situation I would give this a pass is if the car park wasn't absolutely rammed and he genuinely needed to be right next to his friend for some reason - and even then you *ask* politely if a person who wants that space wouldn't mind looking for a different one. However, he didn't even explain his reasons why the space was needed; he just launched immediately into violence and aggression, because clearly this behaviour has worked in getting him what he has felt entitled to in the past.\n\nSo yeah, fuck him. The only way people learn not to act like AHs is when others don't reward their obnoxious behaviour with what they're demanding.", "Once you realized whT was up (which was quickly) you should have moved. It would have been the polite thing to do. That\u2019s why I said ESH."]}
