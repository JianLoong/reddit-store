She deserves to be comfortable and feel good about herself at her celebrations, which means she gets to pick the outfits she wears.", "YTA I get your intent but pressuring people to do shit they aren\u2019t comfortable with sucks. A better solution would have been a shopping trip with Grandma or giving her some ideas of things your daughter would actually like.

Like you would do for a wedding dress, but in this case for a graduation dress? Edit: and please respect your daughters wishes...", "YTA but ask your daughter IF she wouldn't mind wearing it for a private portrait for her great grandmother. GGma can have a beautifully framed photo of her in the dress, and your daughter doesn't have to wear it for her event.\n\nBut if she doesn't want to do that either, respect her choice. (I am reminded of the hand-sewn long skirt my step-grandmother made for me when I was probably 13?

I never forgot that, don't let your daughters graduation memory be like that)", "YTA, both to your daughter and your grandmother. There's a time limit on returns. You're drawing it out after your daughter and your grandmother came to an agreement. Your grandmother is supposed to be returning this dress and getting her money back. Your daughter is old enough to dress herself and you're butting in on her personal style. You are also messing around with an elderly person's finances. If you wait too long, poor old grandma isn't going to be able get her money back. If your grandmother now cannot return the dress and get her money back, I think you could redeem yourself by giving her the amount of money the dress cost her. Also, what a ridiculously formal dress to wear for high school graduation! That's a prom dress or something to wear if you're in a wedding. At high school graduation, you have a gown over your clothes. It doesn't matter what you wear. Nobody will see, because you're wearing the school colors over it. You're really pushing, yes, and for what? Your daughter is a young adult and discussed it herself with your grandmother. Like the actual grownups they are, they came to an agreement. You decided to butt in. Not cool. Lay off a little. Your role now is to help your daughter when she's navigating the world of adulthood. Deciding how she dresses should have ended for you years and years ago. Meddling moms are such a bummer. They're only \"cute\" and \"funny\" on sitcoms. In real life they're totally eye-roll-o-rama.", "YTA. This is supposed to be a celebration of your daughter. Guilt tripping her into wearing a dress that she'll be uncomfortable in will ruin her evening.

Your Grandmother did the right thing and accepted her vision isn't what your daughter is comfortable in. Accept your daughter wants to be relaxed and happy.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t want to wear it. She told you that. She told her grandma that. You\u2019re trying to guilt her. Stop it.", "Yta. This is her graduation day and she\u2019ll want to wear something that she\u2019ll be happy to be in. You wouldn\u2019t want her memories of her graduation to be bitter and spiteful because she was pressured into wearing a dress that she doesn\u2019t like.", "YTA. The day is about her not her great gran. It would spoil it for her to have to dress up to please someone else. Lay off her and let her have her day.", "YTA for assuming your daughter will get married, for assuming how she will dress when she does, for not saying what color the dress is, and for pushing her to wear a dress she hates.\n\nWould you wear a dress you hated to a celebration for an accomplishment you worked hard to achieve?\n\nYou really want her to be embarrassed at her own party?", "YTA.  Your daughter is now an adult, and she expressed the desire to not wear a dress at a celebration for her.  Show her respect and stop trying to guilt trip a special day for her", "YTA. Her body, her choice. That includes whatever covers it.", "Why are you making a celebration of your daughter all about your mother? She has has 92 years of picking her own dresses, does she still dress you too?

It's to highlight your daughter and her graduating class, as well as their achievements. Let her pick out what she wants to wear.", "YTA, never ask someone to wear something FOR someone else. They should only wear it if they want to. This will prevent many problems later in life when others expect her to wear something.", "YTA, she already made her intentions to not wear the dress clear.

You could probably get hour daughter on boarding dressing up and having a nice evening with her grandmother, which would allow yout grand mother to see her in fancy clothes.

Except if you are a controlling person or living in a controlling culture (like mine), then it is common and that is an asshole thing to do.", "But not for THEIR special events. You wouldn\u2019t buy a wedding dress without consulting the bride. You wouldn\u2019t buy someone a suit and tell them that they had to wear it for their own awards ceremony, without consulting them. You wouldn\u2019t buy another adult a Halloween costume without consulting them, and expect them to wear it to their own party.\n\nBuying clothes alone isn\u2019t the problem. Buying what great grandma wants and demanding that the graduate wear it on her special day is the problem.", "which is meaningless to the explanation of \"my decision, not yours\" ....", "Or go to a high tea if there's one near them!", "She literally explained that her daughter may be worried she\u2019ll be pushy but she explained she won\u2019t and she dropped it. She is allowed to ask for opinions.", "Yeah, the dress may not have been OP's daughter's cup of tea, but it doesn't look like she has bad taste.", "It's THE definition of guilting. OP gets partial credit for dropping it after one guilting. So far.", "I think mom is using Grandma to justify her reluctance to relinquish control over her daughter.", "You are right", "If it\u2019s not at all her style I see why she doesn\u2019t want to wear it. Maybe she doesn\u2019t normally wear dresses and a pink girly dress isn\u2019t what she\u2019d choose but something darker or maybe even a suit.", "I agree. My niece graduates this year and HATES her hair curly but my mama loved it (she passed last April). She was extremely close to her so the other day she showed me her look I was surprised all her natural curls (she looked beautiful \ud83e\udd70) we're down and she said it's for grandma.", "This was my thought too, and if shopping is difficult for grandma, maybe they could do it online.", "YTA. If Granny is so progressive, she understands the word NO. If you are that anxious for someone to wear the dress, jump on it sister. Your daughter is an adult she doesn't have to dress to please anyone but herself.", "YTA. Your daughter is not responsible for her great grandma\u2019s happiness. And you\u2019re making her graduation about your grandma. She already said she doesn\u2019t like the dress and she was mature in expressing to her great grandma that she appreciated the gesture but didn\u2019t like it. You\u2019re being dismissive of your daughter\u2019s feelings. \n\nMy mom did this to me A LOT in regards to my grandma\u2019s feelings and others over time. You know what it did to me? Caused me to be a codependent and build resentment towards my mom for being manipulative towards me, as well as having me believe that the needs of others were far more important than my own. Trust me, you don\u2019t want that for your daughter.", "Why don\u2019t you suggest they both pick out a dress together?", "NAH, you were right to drop it. As others suggested, ask your daughter to go shopping with her great grandma. That way they can find something your daughter actually likes and will wear!", "YTA. She hates the dress. And this is your daughter\u2019s big moment, not your mom\u2019s. As an aside, the dress looks exceptionally dated.", "NTA for asking but may I offer another idea? Have her tell her grandmother it isn\u2019t quite her style but maybe have her and her grandmother go out together shopping to find an outfit she will like? The experience itself and bonding moment will be more important than what she ends up wearing anyways!", "NTA if you don\u2019t push it. Also does it have to be that dress? Could it be a dress that is your daughters taste?", "Maybe suggest the two of them pick out an outfit together. The dress is a bit old fashioned and probably not something an 18 yr old would like. It could even be a special memory if daughter and great grandma pick something together.", "YTA Asking once is fine. Asking twice isn't.", "YTA.\nNTA for suggesting her to wear the dress but YTA for making it hard for her to decline. You put her in a situation where refusing to wear the dress will make her feel bad and inconsiderate of her grandma. Thats how you guilt tripand manipulative someone to do something they dont want.", "NAH \n\nCompromise.  Take your daughter and grandmother dress/nice clothes shopping. They can bond over choosing something for her. Your daughter gets a dress/nice outfit she likes and grandma get to see her try on pretty dresses/clothes. Kinda like wedding dress shopping.", "NAH\n\nMaybe you can talk to your daughter and compromise she can pick any fancy dress she would like and wear it for her grandmother.", "YTA.  Stop making this about your grandmother.  It's not.  Stop your whining and stop trying to make your daughter feel guilty.  This is her graduation day, it is something positive.  Your are ruining it and turning it into something negative by putting your daughter in this situation, where she has to either wear something bad that she doesn't want to wear, or disappoint your grandmother, which is a loose/loose situation.  She already said no once, you should have kept your mouth shut instead of trying to guilt your daughter.   Fugly dress anyway.", "Has nobody in this family asked the daughter what kind of dress she might like to wear?", "NTA.Can you maybe suggest a photo session with daughter wearing the dress in some of the photos for grandma to have?", "YTA. \n\nYour daughter was kind and respectful, and asked adults TWICE to not wear the dress and you are still pressuring her. \n\nIt\u2019s your daughter\u2019s graduation, the day is for her. Not you, not her grandmother, her. She should be comfortable and happy in her own skin, celebrating this moment with her friends and peers. She was polite and used her manners and you are entirely dismissing her wants for what? You want to make her accomplishment uncomfortable why?", "Just don\u2019t bring it up again and it\u2019s no biggie. If she comes to you and says she wants to wear it, you should say \u201care you sure? This is about you and I was a little pushy earlier. I don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to\u2026\u201d It\u2019s HER day, and while everyone\u2019s participating it\u2019s HER DAY.", "Maybe a few nice photos of your daughter in the dress? Go to a park, in front of a museum or whatever. Do a mini photo shoot.", "Why would someone buy a dress for someone for this kind of celebration without consulting them?! Yta", "soft, really really soft YTA.  \nYour daughter is launching into adult life, SHE gets to choose how she looks on that day.    \nYour picture is of a dress appropriate for a dance and it says formal, which would typically mean mid caf or longer.   \nIt would likely show under her graduation gown", "NTA Maybe they could compromise and pick out a dress together that they both like .", "Have them go shopping together! That might be a fun bonding situation.", "If you asked, your daughter said no, and you accepted that no, then NAH. It sounds like your daughter and your grandmother have a good relationship and your grandmother accepted the request to return the dress. Perhaps the two of them would enjoy shopping together for a graduation dress - your daughter ultimately gets to pick out something she wants to wear and feels good in, grandmother can be part of the process and feel involved.", " NAH - I wonder if you could suggest your daughter and mom go dress shopping together? Maybe they can make a day if it, spending time together and picking something she likes?", "NAH. You handled it perfectly. You asked twice then dropped it. That\u2019s not pushy. Good job mom", "NTA. It's a beautiful dress.", "For asking, no, but be mindful that it is quite toxic to employ guilt  as a means to manipulate someone else's choices. The question was asked and answered. Stop trying to negotiate.  If daughter regrets it later in life, that's on her. If grandma is unhappy, it's because she didn't ask what your daughter wanted, and chose wrong. Its unfortunate but would have been avoided by including your daughter in the selection. If it was me, I wouldn't want grandma's money to be wasted. Return the dress while you can get a refund and get a present your daughter will cherish. That should be the point of a gift.", "NAH maybe get the daughter and the great-grandmother to shop together. Online or in a store.", "NTA as long as you don\u2019t try to force it on her.", "I think it would be better to let your daughter choose a dress. That way she'll be comfortable. Compromise. \n\nNAH", "Idk but I can tell you the only person in my family excited about me graduating HS was my mom. My dad, sibs, grandparents, and extended family didn\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nBut I can tell you forcing someone to wear clothes they don\u2019t want to is a great way to get them to hate you for a long fucking time.\n\nHave granny and daughter go together to pick out an outfit or accessory of your daughters choice, if granny cares so much. It can even be done online if granny can\u2019t get around much.\n\nStop putting your ma over your kid. If you want to treasure time with your ma because she\u2019s not long for this world, then YOU should hang out with her and let her dress you up.", "Maybe ask her if she doesn't mind taking a picture in it to frame for grandma?", "This!!! OP, ask if your daughter would get photos done with your grandmother in the dress. Don\u2019t have to be anywhere except displayed in the Nan\u2019s house so she can get her moment but daughter doesn\u2019t have to wear it for public events. Might be a nice thing if your daughter agrees.", "This OP. Have a girls night and go out for a nice dinner, if daughter is okay with it she could wear it once.", "Mom has ruined graduation and attempted to gaslight the daughter into blaming herself.", "This is probably why she\u2019s bummed.", "She's hoping for enough backup to use that on her daughter. \" See honey all these people think you should wear it.'", "Or she\u2019s truly doesn\u2019t realize she was in the wrong so she decide to ask Reddit", "Idk,my grandma is 95 and I have worn a lot of ugly dresses through the years that she picked out. I think the daughter will look back on the photos as a nice memory"]}
