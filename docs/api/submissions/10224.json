She deserves to be comfortable and feel good about herself at her celebrations, which means she gets to pick the outfits she wears.", "YTA I get your intent but pressuring people to do shit they aren\u2019t comfortable with sucks. A better solution would have been a shopping trip with Grandma or giving her some ideas of things your daughter would actually like.

Like you would do for a wedding dress, but in this case for a graduation dress? Edit: and please respect your daughters wishes...", "YTA but ask your daughter IF she wouldn't mind wearing it for a private portrait for her great grandmother. GGma can have a beautifully framed photo of her in the dress, and your daughter doesn't have to wear it for her event.\n\nBut if she doesn't want to do that either, respect her choice. (I am reminded of the hand-sewn long skirt my step-grandmother made for me when I was probably 13?

I never forgot that, don't let your daughters graduation memory be like that)", "YTA, both to your daughter and your grandmother. There's a time limit on returns. You're drawing it out after your daughter and your grandmother came to an agreement. Your grandmother is supposed to be returning this dress and getting her money back. Your daughter is old enough to dress herself and you're butting in on her personal style. You are also messing around with an elderly person's finances. If you wait too long, poor old grandma isn't going to be able get her money back. If your grandmother now cannot return the dress and get her money back, I think you could redeem yourself by giving her the amount of money the dress cost her. Also, what a ridiculously formal dress to wear for high school graduation! That's a prom dress or something to wear if you're in a wedding. At high school graduation, you have a gown over your clothes. It doesn't matter what you wear. Nobody will see, because you're wearing the school colors over it. You're really pushing, yes, and for what? Your daughter is a young adult and discussed it herself with your grandmother. Like the actual grownups they are, they came to an agreement. You decided to butt in. Not cool. Lay off a little. Your role now is to help your daughter when she's navigating the world of adulthood. Deciding how she dresses should have ended for you years and years ago. Meddling moms are such a bummer. They're only \"cute\" and \"funny\" on sitcoms. In real life they're totally eye-roll-o-rama.", "YTA. This is supposed to be a celebration of your daughter. Guilt tripping her into wearing a dress that she'll be uncomfortable in will ruin her evening.

Your Grandmother did the right thing and accepted her vision isn't what your daughter is comfortable in. Accept your daughter wants to be relaxed and happy.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t want to wear it. She told you that. She told her grandma that. You\u2019re trying to guilt her. Stop it.", "Yta. This is her graduation day and she\u2019ll want to wear something that she\u2019ll be happy to be in. You wouldn\u2019t want her memories of her graduation to be bitter and spiteful because she was pressured into wearing a dress that she doesn\u2019t like.", "YTA. The day is about her not her great gran. It would spoile it for her to have to dress up to please someone else. Lay off her and let her have her day.", "YTA for assuming your daughter will get married, for assuming how she will dress when she does, for not saying what color the dress is, and for pushing her to wear a dress she hates.\n\nWould you wear a dress you hated to a celebration for an accomplishment you worked hard to achieve?\n\nYou really want her to be embarrassed at her own party?", "YTA.  Your daughter is now an adult, and she expressed the desire to not wear a dress at a celebration for her.  Show her respect and stop trying to guilt trip a special day for her", "YTA. Her body, her choice. That includes whatever covers it.", "Why are you making a celebration of your daughter all about your mother?

It's to highlight your daughter and her graduating class, as well as their achievements. Let her pick out what she wants to wear.", "YTA, never ask someone to wear something FOR someone else. They should only wear it if they want to. This will prevent many problems later in life when others expect her to wear something.", "YTA, she already made her intentions to not wear the dress clear.

You could probably get hour daughter on boarding dressing up and having a nice evening with her grandmother, which would allow yout grand mother to see her in fancy clothes.

Have your daughter take her grandma out on a shopping date and pick something out that they\u2019ll both have fond memories of!", "Well said!", "She has nothing to apologize for. She didn't push it. She dropped it", "This is the way. If they have a good relationship then grandma should understand that the dress she picked just isn\u2019t her taste and daughter should get that grandma wants a chance to see her in something more formal. Let them collaborate on that during a shopping trip. \n\nIf daughter is deeply opposed to any formality for her graduation events, consider suggesting a family-only formal event (anyone having a big anniversary? grandma have a birthday coming up? 4th of July party? really anything will do) where daughter wouldn\u2019t feel put on the spot in front of friends.", "That would probably have been my compromise - wear the dress when seeing gma but not on a \"big\" occasion like graduation, just to a nice dinner with just the two of us.   \n\n\nBut daughter is also not wrong for saying she'd prefer to return it.", "Absolutely. Teenagers don't ever think about death or age unless they're forced to. The daughter may not have thought past the dress not being a fit for their style before declining (and that is absolutely fine). The parent asking again once and providing context does not make them an asshole. \n\nI would have gone to my *college* graduation wearing the most ridiculous clothes I could find if it just meant I could see my grandparents smiling in the crowd one last time.", "OP says they don't like to dress fancy. Maybe a dress is not the way to go.", "I love this. Then they can also pick together and make it special. NAH", "I feel like it\u2019s not grandma\u2019s day so she doesn\u2019t get a say.", "But her wedding day was about her, graduation is about the graduate", "Would you wear a dress you hated to YOUR wedding to make your grandma happy?", "Yeah I don\u2019t get these responses.\n\nI consider I perfectly reasonable *discussing* with a teenager the fact you may occasionally do stuff you don\u2019t really want but isn\u2019t a big deal in the scheme of things because it matters to people you care about. \n\nForcing? No. But the replies here are going nuclear Y.TA for a discussion basically every parent with have at some point with a kid.", "Also why are they trying to dress a teenager up like a bride?", "I'm glad that the daughter feels comfortable saying no and setting boundaries. And also sticking to them. Yes, there could be some compromise here, but not by manipulating her into wearing something she's really not comfortable with.", "[removed]", ">Who buys clothes for someone else's major life event without consulting them?\n\n92-year-old great grandma\u2019s do.", "Oh, that\u2019s a nice idea! If the daughter is uncomfortable with it, yeah, drop it but doing some photos in a nice secluded spot, take grandma along\u2026 that\u2019s much better than her wearing it at a party anyway.", "It would be a nice thing to do in theory, but if at 18 someone had shown me that horrific dress and then suggested photographing me in it for eternal posterity, you'd have seen a me-shaped hole in the wall...", "Ridiculous", "Projecting your end of life fears on your great granddaughter and making a major milestone of hers about you is not \u201clooking like a loving great grandmother.\u201d \n\nSort yourself out.", "I get why she would. Lady knows she wont be there for future milestone events and is wanting to kinda combine em as much as she can. But the gramma seems to care less than op which is the weird part to me. The gramma agreed to send it back p easily it sounds like.", "I think the photos are a good idea, maybe the two of them can take some together too OP\u2019s daughter has some pictures of them together to keep.", "How about keeping the dress and make nice photos with it at a photographer and give them grandma as a present?", "Me too, while reading. OP\u2019s grandma sounds pretty cool, and I bet if she and daughter talked about what she\u2019d like to wear, they could find something amazing between them!", "Her daughter seems bummed out, presumably she doesn\u2019t want this to mar the memory of the graduation. She\u2019s the adult, she should apologize.", "Apologies aren't always because someone was wrong.", "Exactly. It's just...to see her smile and beam at me would be worth it. She was such a kind woman. \n\nBut like you said, teenagers have a different grasp of life and death, and that's okay. But I don't see how OP is such a massive AH just for asking and - as you said - providing more context. It's not like she keeps pushing it.", "For a random day maybe, but for her own graduation? That's what pushes it to YTA", "There\u2019s a solid chance that grandma, who was 18 in 1949, got married as a teenager and  at least knew a couple of teen brides so she might have a skewed perception.", "Let her be comfortable EVERY day.", "I\u2019d keep the dress too, to remember it all.", "This exactly. Personally I got a bit angry that OP was more concerned about how happy the Grandma would be than she was about making sure her daughter was happy. This is clearly a big event for this family but instead of celebrating the daughter, they tried to make it about the Grandma. I do believe that nobody had malicious intent, just very inconsiderate and selfish to ask in the first place, and to ask again after she said no."]}
