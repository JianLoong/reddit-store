She deserves to be comfortable and feel good about herself at her celebrations, which means she gets to pick the outfits she wears.", "YTA I get your intent but pressuring people to do shit they aren\u2019t comfortable with sucks. A better solution would have been a shopping trip with Grandma or giving her some ideas of things your daughter would actually like.

Like you would do for a wedding dress, but in this case for a graduation dress? Edit: and please respect your daughters wishes...", "YTA but ask your daughter IF she wouldn't mind wearing it for a private portrait for her great grandmother. GGma can have a beautifully framed photo of her in the dress, and your daughter doesn't have to wear it for her event.\n\nBut if she doesn't want to do that either, respect her choice. (I am reminded of the hand-sewn long skirt my step-grandmother made for me when I was probably 13?

I never forgot that, don't let your daughters graduation memory be like that)", "YTA, both to your daughter and your grandmother. There's a time limit on returns. You're drawing it out after your daughter and your grandmother came to an agreement. Your grandmother is supposed to be returning this dress and getting her money back. Your daughter is old enough to dress herself and you're butting in on her personal style. You are also messing around with an elderly person's finances. If you wait too long, poor old grandma isn't going to be able get her money back. If your grandmother now cannot return the dress and get her money back, I think you could redeem yourself by giving her the amount of money the dress cost her. Also, what a ridiculously formal dress to wear for high school graduation! That's a prom dress or something to wear if you're in a wedding. At high school graduation, you have a gown over your clothes. It doesn't matter what you wear. Nobody will see, because you're wearing the school colors over it. You're really pushing, yes, and for what? Your daughter is a young adult and discussed it herself with your grandmother. Like the actual grownups they are, they came to an agreement. You decided to butt in. Not cool. Lay off a little. Your role now is to help your daughter when she's navigating the world of adulthood. Deciding how she dresses should have ended for you years and years ago. Meddling moms are such a bummer. They're only \"cute\" and \"funny\" on sitcoms. In real life they're totally eye-roll-o-rama.", "YTA. This is supposed to be a celebration of your daughter. Guilt tripping her into wearing a dress that she'll be uncomfortable in will ruin her evening.

Your Grandmother did the right thing and accepted her vision isn't what your daughter is comfortable in. Accept your daughter wants to be relaxed and happy.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t want to wear it. She told you that. She told her grandma that. You\u2019re trying to guilt her. Stop it.", "Yta. This is her graduation day and she\u2019ll want to wear something that she\u2019ll be happy to be in. You wouldn\u2019t want her memories of her graduation to be bitter and spiteful because she was pressured into wearing a dress that she doesn\u2019t like.", "YTA. The day is about her not her great gran. It would spoil it for her to have to dress up to please someone else. Lay off her and let her have her day.", "YTA for assuming your daughter will get married, for assuming how she will dress when she does, for not saying what color the dress is, and for pushing her to wear a dress she hates.\n\nWould you wear a dress you hated to a celebration for an accomplishment you worked hard to achieve?\n\nYou really want her to be embarrassed at her own party?", "YTA.  Your daughter is now an adult, and she expressed the desire to not wear a dress at a celebration for her.  Show her respect and stop trying to guilt trip a special day for her", "YTA. Her body, her choice. That includes whatever covers it.", "Why are you making a celebration of your daughter all about your mother? She has has 92 years of picking her own dresses, does she still dress you too? YTA", "YTA\n\nHonestly, I get the idea behind it and can respect the initial thought but once your daughter decided she did NOT want to wear the dress, You should've respected it.\n\nThis day, is about her- Not you as parents, nor her grandparents. It's to highlight your daughter and her graduating class, as well as their achievements. Let her pick out what she wants to wear.", "YTA, never ask someone to wear something FOR someone else. They should only wear it if they want to. This will prevent many problems later in life when others expect her to wear something.", "YTA, she already made her intentions to not wear the dress clear.

You could probably get hour daughter on boarding dressing up and having a nice evening with her grandmother, which would allow yout grand mother to see her in fancy clothes.

The problem here is your 92 year old grandmother bought the dress she might have worn to her graduation for a 16 year old in 2023. A 16 year old can and should decide what they wear. Buying the dress without input from her was a mistake. Pressuring her with emotional manipulation to wear it is wrong.

Another idea is to maybe see if she would wear it before or after for 15 minutes, just for some photos with grandma. Graduation is a big deal for everyone, it's so exciting! But most exciting for her, the graduate. And she should feel comfortable whether it's in a dress or no dress", "NAH.
