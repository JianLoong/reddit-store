Much less someone who is making an adult-sized blanket-fort out of bookshelves like a whole child because HE decided to separate from you.", "NTA. He doesn't get boyfriend privileges now he's asked to be a roommate. The cheek of him. Wear those keys on a chain around your neck lol.", "NTA, you ex has no right to your car", "NTA.\n\nYou're joking, right?\n\nEven if you weren't separated, even without his driving history, you're well within your rights to say no. I would make it clear to him that since you are separated, at his insistence, your car is off-limits to him and from now on, his transportation is his problem. This would include those times when you work from home and if you call in sick. There is no circumstance in which you will let him use your car.\n\nBecause the way you handled it leaves him with the impression that he might be able to ask for it again, if you're working from home, sick or having a day off. He needs to be told, without any ambiguity, that he will never be allowed to use your car.\n\nThis will be useful to abbreviate any future instances of him begging for your car. Not that I think he won't stop asking, but you can just say, \"I already said no.\"\n\nAnd by the way, lock your room. He doesn't need to be coming into your room while you're asleep, waking you up and demanding to use your car. If it's urgent, and he needs to wake you up, he should knock on the door like any civilized human being. Not coming in like a creeper to shake you awake.\n\nAs an aside, I would really love to see what the living room looks like with his own little section cordoned off with bookcases. Can you still see the television? Get to the stereo?", "NTA\n\nHe's not entitled to use your car but I would keep an eye on your car and keys in case he tries to take either one or make duplicate car keys.", "NTA. You're separating, he doesn't provide any car upkeep, and he totaled your last car. He can keep his opinions to himself.", "Nta and make sure he doesn't have a key", "NTA. He can find his own way\u2026you are no longer partners. Hide your keys very, very well, and get him or yourself out of the apartment ASAP.", "NTA. Make arrangements, though, to make sure that this weird in-between situation doesn't last for long. Seems like he is getting comfortable for the longer run, if he made a room out of bookshelves for himself. Make sure to set an end date for this living situation. Because you both need to move on. And it is very uncomfortable to live with someone you can no longer trust.", "NTA, it\u2019s your car. If he can\u2019t afford the Uber, he could swallow his pride and ask you (or anyone else!) to borrow money. Instead, he\u2019s making his inability to plan and take responsibility in his life your fault.", "NTA\n\nIt's your car. You bought it and paid for it. And even if you weren't in the process of a separation, you shouldn't let him drive your car anyways after he totaled the last one.\n\nAnd yes, it sounds totally sus about how he was totally for you taking another day off/working from home. He's up to something. Hide your keys somewhere he won't/can't look. And don't tell anyone, even someone on here.", "NTA. He made his bed and now he has to lie in it.
