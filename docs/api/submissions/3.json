It's in another city and we would have to fly out. As I mentioned, traveling makes me sick so I unfortunately won't be able to go.

But none of those things apply here.\n\nYou\u2019re literally asking him to put your comfort ahead of his grief, to miss out on the funeral and being around family for support while mourning in order to stay home and be support for *you*?  If he says he needs to be there, then he needs to be there.", "YTA. You\u2019re fine at 7months. I\u2019m 33 weeks and extremely high risk. If my husband\u2019s siblings passed away unexpectedly I would absolutely expect my husband to fly out even if I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry you get sick when you travel. I have bad Hyperemesis Gravidarum and I throw up violently all the time for no reason and have to be on zofran to keep some nutrition in. I understand you get nauseous(I really do and I empathize wholeheartedly!!), but your poor husband is actively grieving and isn\u2019t going somewhere on a whim. He\u2019s literally going to their funerals.

Exactly what support are you offering your husband outside of having him meet your needs? \n\nThis is a situation where your support can be provided by your mother, sibling or friend for a few days. You have no specific reason why he needs to stay outside of support for you. No one wants to go to a funeral. No one wants to bury a sibling. The fact that his family is dealing with all of this and you\u2019re focused on yourself doesn\u2019t reflect well on you. You should think about what this situation is saying about you and work on improving that. \n\nIn my last pregnancy, my ex had to travel for work 4 weeks before my due date and the doctors said I would likely go into labor early. Know what we did? Had my mom stay with me for the 3 days he was gone and had alternative options to get him home asap if it came down to it. Was I nervous? Yes.

You HAVE to have someone else that lives locally that can act as an emergency contact in the possibility of something going wrong, be it a friend, relative or otherwise.  You also say you want him there \"just for support\" - this is INCREDIBLY self-centred - He ALSO needs support - he has lost his brother and is in the middle of grieving, yet given how you portrayed yourself in your post, you are coming across as VERY \"me me me\".\n\nAlso the comment about video-calling for a freakin' FUNERAL shows just how much empathy you seem to be lacking - he can't exactly hug someone though a cellphone screen and emotions will be running high on that day.", "Absolutely YTA\nPregnancy has been fine so far and you're only 7 months along.

You\u2019ve had a smooth pregnancy and therefore have no reason to think something will happen two months out. This is a funeral. He should be able to go bury his step brother in this situation without it being a problem. Do you think preventing him from being there with his family is going to make the rest of your life as a member of his family any easier? I can almost guarantee it won\u2019t.

You can video call him while he\u2019s away and have other support system. Friends or family. This is his family that passed away. You need to be more supportive of him than making it all about you you you you.", "YTA, sorry but if you genuinely don't expect anything to happen for at least another 2 months, it'd be awful for him to miss out grieving his family (and not support the more impacted members of his family no less!). It's understandable for you to be nervous, but it's really way too much of an ask.

A funeral and a chance to grieve with family is not something you can just skip and be ok.", "YTA. I don't think you are trying to be one but this is not the hill you want to die on.

You\u2019re 7 months along in a healthy pregnancy with no complications. He\u2019s a plane ride away if an emergency occurs. It\u2019s time to put on your big girl panties and be home alone for 2-3 days. Even a week.", "YTA. Do you have family or friends close by? Let your husband go to the funeral. This is something you don't want to come between the two of you. Please be supportive of your husband and family who are grieving.

You will be fine for a day on your own.", "YTA-Your husband does not need to be around you 24/7 just because you are pregnant. Especially since you\u2019re having a healthy and normal pregnancy. I was working in a warehouse doing physical labor in 135 degree heat at 7 months (no I do not suggest anyone do this and it\u2019s not a flex, it was miserable), so the idea that you can\u2019t be alone for a few days so your husband can go to HIS BROTHER\u2019S FUNERAL is ridiculous. Pregnancy is a serious medical condition but it does not make you inept nor made of glass. It should also not make you lose your empathy and reason.

You are being unreasonable.   I understand you being too sick to travel yourself but you are only 7 months along. There is no reason why he shouldn't be able to go to his siblings funeral. He's not going for a weekend with the boys or some pleasure trip. He's going to say goodbye to someone he loved and support the rest of his family. He needs your support not your selfishness.

Pregnancy hormones or are you always this selfish? YTA", "YTA - and I\u2019m so OVER seeing people qualify family relationships with \u201chalf\u201d or \u201cstep\u201d or whatever. It reeks of attempted diminishing of a relationship. It\u2019s your husband\u2019s BROTHER. How about YOU video chat with your husband while he\u2019s away if you miss him or are feeling stressed. And how about the two of you put some contingency plans in place for support people to assist you in your husband\u2019s absence should something occur.

Your child needs their dad to be a whole functional person when they arrive in a couple of months. You're not at your due-date or close, you're not on bed-rest, you have to let him go so he can deal with this situation as best he can, because having a newborn is a test on any relationship and a parents mental health. You need to support him now, because he's your partner and because you and your child will need his support soon. Thisbis a huge blow and he needs to heal, he needs support.  If you sow resentment now (which this would) the sleep deprivation a crying baby brings can make the worst come out of anyone. I know you feel fragile and helpless now, I remember that all too well, but you will be fine for a few days. Have a friend come over to keep you company and have some time with them, you'll have your hands full for a few months soon, keeping up with people when you have a small baby is tough.

The way we are made to prioritize ourselves when we are incubating new life really tends to make us shortsighted when it comes to the needs of others. This one?

End of story", "YTA what the heck. A funeral, his and your family. Have someone stay with you???", "Do you have friends?  Family?  USE THEM.  Otherwise you\u2019re a total AH.

But pregnant you - is an asshole.", "YTA um his brother just died?!!! You are an adult woman approximately 2.5 months from giving birth with apparently no complications so far? He would presumably only be going for a few days? \n\nI honestly do not understand how you are making this about you.", "YTA. Pregnancy is not an illness, you do not need your hand held at every moment. Right now your husbands needs are the priority and it\u2019s selfish and mean of you not be supporting him in any way you can. Not travelling is fine, preventing him from attending is not fine.", "You should let him go be with his family. This is such a sad situation for them.", "See if you can have a friend stay with you. If your husband misses the funeral he may never forgive you.", "YTA... if you are not high-risk, 7 months is an okay risk for him to fly out of state. You are not in imminent risk of labor, and he could be back in a day or so easily. My husband flew halfway across the world to see his dying parent when I was around 7 months (and with a toddler at home). Was it tough for me? Yes. But his mental health and being there to support his family also matters. \n\nIf you absolutely cannot separate from him for a couple days, I'd consider driving or taking a train together, if it's a reasonable distance and he's up for it.

No additional info required.", "YTA 100%  My first pregnancy was difficult, I was considered high risk, actually went into labor and had it stopped several times.  Baby daddy was already a dead beat, I made it through without his support. You can manage for the duration of a funeral... And maybe give him support for his enormous loss.", "YTA.

Would YOU want to go to your brothers funeral if he passed away. By the sounds of it , it sounds like maybe they passed tragically and unexpectedly. So OFCOURSE he needs to be with family.To pay his respects and say goodbye one last time. Doing that on a video call isn\u2019t the same. And I hope you don\u2019t think just because it\u2019s a STEP brother that it\u2019s less important. A sibling is a sibling in my books. It\u2019s just plain RESPECT!! That he should attend. And it\u2019s plain DISRESPECTFUL that you even suggest that he can\u2019t go just because you DONT WANT TO! You said yourself the pregnancy has been ok so far. The only thing is , is that it makes you sick. So it\u2019s simple. Stay home and you WONT be sick. Your pregnant not cripple , pretty sure you can survive a few days while his family mourns loved ones. Women have been giving birth for thousands of years. You\u2019ll be ok.

I can understand where you\u2019re coming from but at the same time that\u2019s two people who probably died unexpectedly. The whole family would be grieving. If your husband doesn\u2019t go, he may end up regretting it for a very long time and that guilt may be difficult to bear. A video call probably won\u2019t cut it. When someone dies it\u2019s easy to extrapolate your own circumstances and think of the what ifs. It can be illogical but it doesn\u2019t stop it from happening. Perhaps you could stay with some friends or family for the few days that your husband needs to comfort his family and pay his respects. My condolences.", "YTA You are being very selfish.", "YTA. I bet if it was your sibling and their partner or your parents you'd go but since it's your husband's you not only wont go, you expect him not to go either because you want support...

Seriously? He\u2019s suffered a great loss here, and unless you left out something significant, you\u2019re fine. He\u2019ll be gone a few days.

Unless you have serious complications, there's no reason you can't be alone for a few days while your husband pays respects to a family member.  \n\n\nC'mon now.  This is not grown up behavior.", "Totally TAH here his sibling and partner died and you don\u2019t want him to go to their funeral because you want him there just in case? No he needs to go be with his family and greave with his family you don\u2019t have to go but he has to", "Sorry but soft YTA. For a close family funeral, it is unreasonable and yes, unsupportive to suggest he not go. You should apologise, assure him that you fully support him to go, and then, as other posters suggest, find other people to hang with you while he is away, and do whatever you can to distract yourself so that you're not constantly contacting him.", "I got travel sick in pregnancy but not at any other time in like four of my six pregnancies. Still, OP, YTA. You can sit at home for a weekend and let your husband grieve. You've no reasonable excuse for asking him to stay with you. You need to develop some resilience or motherhood will really be a doozy for you.", "Yeah, I mean \" I need his support in case something happens\"\n\nSOMETHING JUST HAPPENED IN HIS FAMILY AND HE NEEDS THEIR SUPPORT / WANTS TO SUPPORT THEM!\n\nLet him tend to actual incidents before taking care of hypothetical ones.", "And sometimes you're not going to be the priority", "That \"traveling makes me sick so **we** won't be able to go\" was wild to read. Of course YTA. He is allowed to have other people in his life that matter to him"]}
