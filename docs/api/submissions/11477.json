I haven\u2019t really had much luck in that aspect of my life and I\u2019m in a pretty intensive degree program so I don\u2019t have much time to party or meet women. \n\nOne of my friends is a bit promiscuous and is weirdly proud of it. When I say a bit I am very much downplaying how much she sleeps around. Now that\u2019s none of my businesses and I have no right to judge what a woman does with her body, but if you asked me honestly, I\u2019d say I just wish I didn\u2019t have to hear about how much sex she\u2019s having.\n\nSo we were talking about numbers and some of us admitted to our numbers. One of the guys made a comment that he wouldn\u2019t date a girl with a body count over 5. I said I would agree with him and the aforementioned girl got mad. She had previously admitted to having a body count of around 75 so I think she took offense to what we said.\n\nShe snapped on him called him out on preferring a woman with a smaller count as he said he\u2019d been with like 15 women. Now whether he deserved that or not is up to God, not me. But where I felt that she crossed the line is when she came after me because, as I\u2019ve said, my body count is not near 5.\n\nShe told me I had no room to talk about what I want in a woman since I\u2019m 22 and a virgin so clearly I am not at all what any woman wants in a man. So I won\u2019t lie, my feelings were hurt so I popped back off. I told her that I\u2019m more normal than she is considering she\u2019s a ran through hoe that\u2019s been with damn near 80 different men. I also think I may have called her fatherless, but I don\u2019t exactly remember it happening that way. \n\nShe was either so upset or so hurt that we started crying. I felt bad, but not like I was in the wrong, she provoked my response after I did nothing to her. All the girls there were mad at me and called me misogynistic for saying that and the party ended pretty abruptly after that.

We live in a weird culture where losing your virginity at a young age is a huge deal but it\u2019s not! Losing your virginity is for when you decide you\u2019re ready, not when someone else thinks you should. \n\nNext point, judging people off their body count is a bit skeezy. Obviously as humans we all have our preferences but to say someone is less than because they\u2019ve had too little or too many sexual partners is rude. As you\u2019ve said it doesn\u2019t feel good when she takes shots at you for your lack thereof so it\u2019s safe to assume it hurts when the opposite point is made.

I am similar. I used to be very uncomfortable with my sexuality, my inability to trust this very important and intimate act with people I haven't known for very long, and my body. I started seeing a therapist. He gave me wisdom that I would have never been able to get elsewhere and has made me feel better in my own skin. \n\nIf you have that preference and feel uncomfortable giving yourself away to people, you don't need to feel insecure or bad about it. You are likely a mentally and physically private person and want someone who has the same values as you (I am the same way). Keep your chin up. She shouldn't have made fun of you for it. She had no right.\n\nHowever, you shouldn't have said what you said about her either. Some people use sex as a form of validation. Based on her reaction to what your other friend said, this is likely why she got mad.\n\nYour friend said something that made her mad. She said something that hurt you. You said something that hurt her back. This sounds like a normal fight between friends in their early 20s. \n\nI have plenty of friends that are promiscuous (male and female). They know how I feel about sex and my virginity. I know their views on sex. We understand each other. Try to understand her point of view. Maybe she uses it as validation or maybe she just likes having sex. Both are completely fine and well within her right as is yours to not pursue sex as both of our friends have.\n\nI am gonna say NAH. Everyone deserves to have their preference. Is your male friend hypocritical? Yes, but everyone is to some degree. I would never date a woman with anxiety. One of us needs to not be able to freak out over small, everyday life lol. You guys need to talk this out. Share your feelings. It may be hard as a man to do that (It was and still is for me) but it makes life easier and then your friends know what hurts you and what doesn't. \n\nGood luck friend. I hope things work out. \n\nTLDR - NAH", "Definitely not the AH. It\u2019s her preference to sleep around with whoever she wants. It\u2019s your preference to want to date someone with less sexual experience.

She shouldn't pick on you about your virginity and then be all Picchu face when her 75+ comes into play.

Let's play this out. Why don't you want to be with a woman who has had more than 5 partners? What difference does that make to you?

Also, you admit to maybe calling her fatherless, which is rude, unrelated, and a really messed up low blow when you include it in reference to body count and sex. \n\nYou say she judged you first, but, if you\u2019re talking about body counts and how any woman with over 5 past partners is not good enough for you, that feels a little bit judgy, especially when she\u2019s in the room.

But if they were otherwise great for me and didn't have the qualities I don't appreciate then I'd continue the relationship with them. \n\nFor my verdict - ESH. Your friend deserved it but I don't know why she came after you like that, YTA for going to that level with her. \n\nIf I can give you some advice - go talk to her.

OP merely agreed that he had the same preference of a low body count. Is that guy a hypocrite? Yea, seems like it. But OP doesn't have to be a white knight 24/7 correcting other peoples behavior.
