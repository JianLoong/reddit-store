But help me settle this argument lol. My Fianc\u00e9 was being sweet and wanted to cook me and our son breakfast. He asked me how many eggs I wanted and I said one. He says \"I'm going to cook you two\" so I proceeded to tell him not to because I only wanted one. He cooks me two anyways. I only eat one, and now he's telling me I should eat the other one but I'm full. Again, I know this is kinda stupid but AITA?\n\nEdit: Sorry, I left this out. He also said he was just worried I wasn't eating enough. Which I understand. I just had coffee too and knew I wasn't going to be able to eat two lol\n\nEdit 2: I appreciate the concern guys, but I promise you that my Fianc\u00e9 is far from controlling. We have a very healthy relationship and this was supposed to be a funny and light hearted post to take away from some of the bad ones on here.

If your full your full overeating for someone else\u2019s pleasure is not ok.", "NTA - why did he ask you how many eggs you wanted if he was just going to decide how many you needed to eat anyway? It's borderline controlling and weird. I was with someone like this once and didn't realize how much of a red flag it actually was until years after we were apart.

But ask yourself if there's any merit to his concern that you aren't eating enough. I think it's very easy to be busy caring for others and forget about yourself.

A chill pill would be a frivolous, overkill prescription.", "The only reason I only ate one is because coffee makes me feel sick to my stomach sometimes. I barely got any sleep last night and needed the burst of energy. I'm an avid food lover and definitely won't go without eating. He's a very sweet man, and is a worrier. I'm the same way so I totally understand.

But I do believe that pushing someone to eat more than they want to is wrong. When someone says they are full respect that and don\u2019t push it on them to finish their food.

I believe pushing someone to eat more in some scenarios would be wrong, but not all. I also don\u2019t believe OP\u2019s SO did enough to be considered pushy. \n\nSometimes my girlfriend wants 3 eggs, sometimes 2. I make her three every time, serve her, then make mine. Half of the time, I get an extra egg for breakfast. The other half of the time, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to cook again after I finish eating. 100% of the time, she feels happy and cared for. \n\nConversations and interactions like OP\u2019s need to happen so that both of them can understand each other\u2019s habits, love languages, feelings, and thoughts. All I see here is a healthy interaction between two people trying to understand how to care for each other. No malice, no attempted force-feeding, and no blatant disrespect of boundaries occurred.", "Oh well yeah nope that\u2019s just wrong.

I agree it\u2019s not that big of a deal to shame anyone just a thought to have for the next occurrence.", "I guess it takes one in a healthy relationship to know one in a healthy relationship.

Have a nice rest of your day!", "OP literally said they\u2019re laughing about it now. You\u2019re being too rigid and negative-focused with your inferences. \n\nWanting to make sure someone eats enough (bringing it up because it\u2019s on your mind), and trying to understand them and their bodies (gaining an understanding of each other and laughing together afterward) is not being pushy. \n\nAlso, OP responded to my other comment and happily confirmed they\u2019re SO ate their extra egg too. \n\nI truly hope you allow more positivity into your life in the future, as well as polish up those run-on sentences. Good day.\n\nETA: I reread your last comment and disagree with another part I missed. I think it is always a big deal to shame someone, which is why it\u2019s important to get your facts straight before doing so.", "OP made a post asking for ppls opinions I gave mine you gave yours. Good day", "The well thought out and accurate opinions are the appreciated ones. Better luck next time with that, and good day to you as well.", "Because my opinion did not align with yours it\u2019s not valid?
