I have three kids. My youngest just turned one, so I have a lot of baby stuff (baby swing, clothes, toys, etc) that we don\u2019t need anymore. Instead of donating them I thought it would be nice to let my SIL and her wife look at them before. \n\nI brought them over and they picked out what they wanted/needed and my SIL immediately put it in the washing machine. I\u2019m a very clean person, and all of the baby stuff was clean, so I confronted my SIL. I asked her why she needed to clean my stuff if it wasn\u2019t dirty, and she knows I\u2019m not dirty. My SIL said that she\u2019s cleaning everything and named a long list of things she\u2019s cleaning/cleaned for the baby (sterilized all bottles and pacifiers, washed all blankets, clothes, etc). I told my SIL that it\u2019s pretty stupid to wash everything because what if she wants to take something back, and it\u2019s not like cleaning everything in her house is going to make her prepared for her baby. Nothing prepares you for your first. \n\nMy SIL took this as me being mean, but I was trying to be helpful. She should enjoy her last few weeks of pregnancy instead of cleaning everything. My SIL\u2019s wife told me that \u201cwe are allowed to do things differently with our children.\u201d I pointed out to them that they\u2019ve never had children, so she\u2019s going to feel silly for doing. I also told them that when I was pregnant with my first I didn\u2019t want to listen to anyone, and I regretted it later. They will too. My SIL made it seem like I was being an AH, but I don\u2019t see it. AITA?\n\nEdit: Obviously I know what \u201cnesting\u201d is, and obviously I wanted everything clean and perfect too. However, when one of my family members gifted me something, or if someone I KNOW is clean and takes care of things-I didn\u2019t throw it in the washer. I might be coming off as nitpicking, but when someone throws something in the washer that came from your house like it was something dirty you would be annoyed too.", "created_utc": 1694049909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c2fuh/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_she_doesnt_have_to/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry, but I would wash everything too. Plus, this helps your SIL in her excitement for the upcoming birth of her precious baby. You literally just rained on her parade", "YTA. Your baby stuff needed a wash even if it was clean when you put it away. It doesn't hurt to freshen things up even if they were still clean. Why is this something you chose to fuss at her about? Cleaning everything in her house will sure make those first few days/weeks out of the hospital easier for her. Also, cleaning can be considered nesting behavior. Many pregnant women \"nest\" before giving birth. A quick google search will show: This urge to clean and organize is known as nesting. Nesting during pregnancy is the overwhelming desire to get your home ready for your new baby. The nesting instinct is strongest in the later weeks coming upon delivery.  - there is nothing wrong with what your SIL is doing. It's perfectly NORMAL.

It\u2019s an instinct that affects many pregnant women near the end of their pregnancy.

I have three kids. My youngest just turned one, so I have a lot of baby stuff (baby swing, clothes, toys, etc) that we don\u2019t need anymore. Instead of donating them I thought it would be nice to let my SIL and her wife look at them before. \n\nI brought them over and they picked out what they wanted/needed and my SIL immediately put it in the washing machine. I\u2019m a very clean person, and all of the baby stuff was clean, so I confronted my SIL. I asked her why she needed to clean my stuff if it wasn\u2019t dirty, and she knows I\u2019m not dirty. My SIL said that she\u2019s cleaning everything and named a long list of things she\u2019s cleaning/cleaned for the baby (sterilized all bottles and pacifiers, washed all blankets, clothes, etc). I told my SIL that it\u2019s pretty stupid to wash everything because what if she wants to take something back, and it\u2019s not like cleaning everything in her house is going to make her prepared for her baby. Nothing prepares you for your first. \n\nMy SIL took this as me being mean, but I was trying to be helpful. She should enjoy her last few weeks of pregnancy instead of cleaning everything. My SIL\u2019s wife told me that \u201cwe are allowed to do things differently with our children.\u201d I pointed out to them that they\u2019ve never had children, so she\u2019s going to feel silly for doing.

Or did you only post here hoping we'd all be on your side? \n\nAnd no, anyone wouldn't get annoyed if someone threw something for their newborn in the washer. This is a you problem. You can't tell us we'd be annoyed too, we are telling you a normal person would NOT be annoyed at a parent wanting to keep things as clean as possible for their newborn. And if you ARE annoyed by that, you have issues. \n\nTo a newborns immune system, everyone IS dirty. That's not an insult, it's just a fact. Maybe ask yourself why you're getting so defensive and triggered over possibly being seen as \"dirty\". Have you always had issues like this? If you went to a hospital and they asked you to sanitise your hands upon entering the building do you get triggered and personally offended? If you go to a swimming pool and you're asked to shower before entering the water, do you get triggered and personally offended?", "I wouldn't be. I would be understanding and helpful and not be a dick about it. She's not saying you aren't clean. She is protecting a newborn baby, but you're acting like one.", "YTA- How about this, your standard of clean is not someone else's standard of clean. They do not know what kind of laundry detergent you used when you last washed an item and babies are super sensitive to that. \n\nThis is their first child, let them live, and learn. Also how long have these items been stored? If it's even been a month or two, they should probably be washed especially if they weren't stored in air tight tubs. They do not know what their child will be sensitive to so they are taking precautions, stop being an AH and let them have all these new experiences. \n\nWith my first child I washed every single thing they would come in contact with, with that special baby laundry soap, yes I realized it's not that big of a deal with the second but nothing anyone said could have changed my mind on doing all I could to make sure that baby was gonna be comfortable.", "No, not everyone would be annoyed if someone threw something in the wash after it being gifted to them for a new born baby. \n\nI recieved hand-me-downs, I washed everything after it was gifted to me. You are SUPPOSED to wash it all. Thats the normal default setting. I handed things down to other expectant mothers when I was done with them. Yes I washed them first but i fully expected them to also wash it themselves. Some laundry soaps and fabric softeners are harmful to a newborn baby's skin. You do not know what other ppls use.\n\nYour instant reaction to feel insulted over something completely normal and not harmful is more telling about you than anyone else.\n\nYTA and you should definitely apologize to your SILs for your over reaction.", "Are the only things you throw in the washer reaching a level that you would consider \u201cdisgusting\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m guessing no. I\u2019m guessing like most people, you wear your clothes, they don\u2019t all every single one get \u201cdisgusting\u201d and you throw them in the wash. \n\nI would most definitely wash clothes someone donated not because they\u2019re disgusting but because **I would definitely want my brand new, barely having an immune system, freshie baby to have clothes that I cleaned myself.** Any clothes that have been donated to me, I wash. I would not at all be offended to learn someone washed clothes that I donated to them either. \n\nNow brand new clothes, I was those cuz they\u2019re actually disgusting. Manufacturing facilities are not haven\u2019s of cleanliness.", "LMFAO you\u2019re just not even willing to accept the verdict. Why did you even post this?", "YTA\n\nFFS.  Listen to what people are saying.  This is a YOU problem. \n\nNo, most people wouldn\u2019t get annoyed by that.  Who cares if they rewashed everything? It has no impact on you - you aren\u2019t paying their water bill, you aren\u2019t buying their detergent.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is that you double downed and lectured them.  Let them enjoy the experience of their first child and back off.\n\nYou sound insufferable.", "I have to use specific detergent or I get rashes so yes, I would wash again and I wouldn't expect anyone to go off on me for it. If someone did the same back I would not care because I don't take things that personally.", "This is what I thought too", "Oof. Those *free* hand-me-downs came at a pretty steep cost, didn't they?", "Even if it's barely touched I'd still wash them anyway because manufacturing process and all... \ud83d\ude05", "Hey I don't really give a shit about explaining myself to someone online who refuses to understand any sort of nuance and just wants to Be Right so have a good night", "I have the feeling that OP takes offense at a lot of stuff. \n\nIf I may do the Reddit stretch:\u2026 She may even be struggling with the family\u2019s attention switching to the new baby in the family after she\u2019s had the most recent, possibly the several most recent, and *possibly* the only babies that generation so far.\n\nSo the shows not going to be about her for much longer.", "That's exactly what I was thinking, I hate when clothes have the smell of someone else's conditioner, they don't feel right!", "Plus I would always wash anything second hand regardless of if I know it\u2019s clean", "When a houseguest leaves, I wash the bedding. If a few months pass and someone else is coming, I wash it again. Things sitting around can gather dust which is mites and skin cells. \n\nI\u2019d be even more inclined to do this sort of thing for a baby. OP\u2019s defensiveness and incredulity someone would do this, makes me wonder how \u201cclean\u201d she really is.", "And if you have a baby, you don't want them to smell like someone else's family. It's not just the detergent, it's everything about the house and the people living in it.", "Whether or not this is true, it DOES make me feel better about my own stored baby stuff!", "Sometimes milk protein will discolor over time, washing new then hanging to dry in sunshine clears it up!", "Yea, I noticed them too when I reused the baby clothes from my oldest, I think the acid in the spit doesn't come out of those clothes completely. But after washing them again I used them anyway\ud83e\udd23", "Haha it does! I was shaking my head, what was I thinking saving all these!? Baby #2 deserves to stain their clothes themselves! I kept the expensive stuff like the halo swaddles. But nobody will see those but us anyway!", "Yes. They seem to set.", "Those stains do get worse over time.", "Babies shouldn't wear secondhand clothes that haven't been laundered either. These items can accumulate thousands of pathogens in storage and you can never know how the items were washed, the temperature, the drying method, etc. \n\nNewborns are have very sensitive skin so a little extra caution is necessary and if it makes a new mom feel better, she should do what she feels is right.", "Obviously I asked for other people\u2019s opinions, which is why I\u2019m not arguing with you. Don\u2019t ask me questions if you don\u2019t want me to answer them.", "TBH, you should also wash new clothes - there are a lot of things that can get on things in the storage process and also you never know what cleaning solution is used.\n\nEven if this wasn't the case, this is a weird hill to die on. Don't create tension with your SIL when all you need to do is shrug and move on.", "Same.   \n\n\nI was gifted 9 bags of baby clothes from my partner's cousin's wife. You better believe I washed every stitch of clothing in those 9 bags.   \n\n\nHonestly, washing and folding and putting away the clothes made it \"real\" in a way that it wasn't before doing that. And I'm glad I did it all early, too, because Squiddo decided a month early was the perfect time to announce their presence to the world.", "I\u2019ve given things to other moms and have said to them \u201cI\u2019ve already washed this but I\u2019d understand if you wanted to wash it again.\u201d Or \u201cIt\u2019s been washed with regular detergent.\u201d", "I wash even first hand clothes.\n\nWhere I worked*, they kept clothes mostly in the open at the basement.\n\nDust, mice (traps everywhere), destroyed boxes and  who know where the production plant (?!?) kept the materials and readymade clothes.\n\n* think like Harrods", "Yes, exactly! You want your own flock to smell \"right\". \n\nBut it's weird how the smell still stays in the fabric. I notice it the when I iron something after I washed it for the first time (if I iron it.) But of course that's not very noticeable and doesn't matter.", "Yellow stains? They definitely develop in storage. Some of them here came out with a wash and some sun, others did not. No idea why the difference \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t have kids of my own, but I\u2019m the person to go to to deep clean clothing. My nibblings get handmedown clothing from their cousins all. the. time.\n\nI take them and soak them in the tub with baking soda and stain remover for a few soaks and you wouldn\u2019t believe how brown the water gets, even when the clothes were freshly washed. Like, stuff really does just bake itself into the fabrics and gets stuck in there. And babies? They REALLY know how to get themselves dirty, with their food, poop/pee blowouts, spit up, etc.", "That actually made me laugh out loud, because I DO want you to answer them, but it's you that's skirting around the questions. Your lack of self awareness is concerning. I'll break the questions down for you so it's easier as obviously you're struggling a lot. \n\n\n1. Maybe ask yourself why you're getting so defensive and triggered over possibly being seen as \"dirty\". Have you always had issues like this? \n\n2. If you went to a hospital and they asked you to sanitise your hands upon entering the building, would you get triggered and personally offended? \n\n3. If you go to a swimming pool and you're asked to shower before entering the water, do you get triggered and personally offended?\n\n4. Are you aware that to a newborns immune system, everything not sterile IS dirty. That is not an insult to you, that is simply a fact. \n\n5. Are you aware that you can't tell other people they'd be annoyed when we are clearly telling you we would not be annoyed at a parent wanting to keep things as clean as possible for their newborn? You cannot decide other people's feelings for them. \n\n6. There are at least a thousand people here telling you you're the asshole, you're being petty and you refuse to accept it. But at the same time you're saying you're not arguing with people. Then at the same time you're telling people no you'd be annoyed too. Invalidating their very valid opinions. Do you usually dictate how others should feel about matters? Do you usually react like this when things don't go your way or when people aren't on your side like you expected? Seems you've got bigger issues than just being an asshole.", "YTA, and sI have a feeling it\u2019s not just restricted to this single interaction with your SIL \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", " I am a first time mom who has received numerous of donated baby supplies. I still washed every donations I received regardless of where these donations came from. I am very grateful for everything I have received for my baby. I bet your SIL is extremely grateful to receive donations from you. Yet, you wanted to feel offended when she decided to rewash everything you have given to her. I understand you cleaned everything before donating these items to your SIL. However, you need to understand that she is rewashing everything that was donated for the safety of HER first child. It does not mean she is calling you dirty in any way. It means that she wants to be prepared for her first baby. Just because you\u2019ve experienced the joy of motherhood does not mean you can criticize your SIL for wanting to rewash everything. This is HER time to enjoy the last few weeks of her pregnancy before she experience the blessing of motherhood. Stop being butthurt about the situation and support your SIL!", "Agreed. And OP\u2019s edit is just doubling down on her sanctimonious statement. It\u2019s extremely patronising to tell someone what they should/shouldn\u2019t do to prepare for a baby. Like, how are they going to regret washing things? YTA, OP.", "I worked in the warehouse for Gap. Old Navy and Banana Republic included- same company. That warehouse was filthy. Sure, the clothes were bagged but it doesn\u2019t mean they are clean. I always wash clothes and dishes before I use them. New or used."]}
