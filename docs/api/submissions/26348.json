I have three kids. My youngest just turned one, so I have a lot of baby stuff (baby swing, clothes, toys, etc) that we don\u2019t need anymore. Instead of donating them I thought it would be nice to let my SIL and her wife look at them before. \n\nI brought them over and they picked out what they wanted/needed and my SIL immediately put it in the washing machine. I\u2019m a very clean person, and all of the baby stuff was clean, so I confronted my SIL. I asked her why she needed to clean my stuff if it wasn\u2019t dirty, and she knows I\u2019m not dirty. My SIL said that she\u2019s cleaning everything and named a long list of things she\u2019s cleaning/cleaned for the baby (sterilized all bottles and pacifiers, washed all blankets, clothes, etc). I told my SIL that it\u2019s pretty stupid to wash everything because what if she wants to take something back, and it\u2019s not like cleaning everything in her house is going to make her prepared for her baby. Nothing prepares you for your first. \n\nMy SIL took this as me being mean, but I was trying to be helpful. She should enjoy her last few weeks of pregnancy instead of cleaning everything. My SIL\u2019s wife told me that \u201cwe are allowed to do things differently with our children.\u201d I pointed out to them that they\u2019ve never had children, so she\u2019s going to feel silly for doing. I also told them that when I was pregnant with my first I didn\u2019t want to listen to anyone, and I regretted it later. They will too. My SIL made it seem like I was being an AH, but I don\u2019t see it. AITA?\n\nEdit: Obviously I know what \u201cnesting\u201d is, and obviously I wanted everything clean and perfect too. However, when one of my family members gifted me something, or if someone I KNOW is clean and takes care of things-I didn\u2019t throw it in the washer. I might be coming off as nitpicking, but when someone throws something in the washer that came from your house like it was something dirty you would be annoyed too.", "created_utc": 1694049909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c2fuh/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_she_doesnt_have_to/", "score": 6665, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literally everyone I know washes donated clothes, especially donated baby clothes. You made a whole thing out of nothing.", "YTA - why does it matter? She\u2019s a first time mother, she\u2019s washing things. There is no need to call her stupid.", "YTA. Seems like you immediately took her washing your stuff as a passive-aggressive comment on your cleanliness, and then went reaching for reasons to justify yourself instead of just backing off and letting it go. She's a first-time mom, and you're calling her stupid and telling her that she's doing everything wrong! Back the hell off!", "YTA. Get off that imaginary high horse of yours just because you have 3 kids. Let the expecting mother go through pregnancy her own way.", "She's nesting.  You're being petty and insulting.  YTA.", "YTA. Sorry, but I would wash everything too. Plus, this helps your SIL in her excitement for the upcoming birth of her precious baby. You literally just rained on her parade", "YTA. Your baby stuff needed a wash even if it was clean when you put it away. It doesn't hurt to freshen things up even if they were still clean. Why is this something you chose to fuss at her about? Cleaning everything in her house will sure make those first few days/weeks out of the hospital easier for her. Also, cleaning can be considered nesting behavior. Many pregnant women \"nest\" before giving birth. A quick google search will show: This urge to clean and organize is known as nesting. Nesting during pregnancy is the overwhelming desire to get your home ready for your new baby. The nesting instinct is strongest in the later weeks coming upon delivery.  - there is nothing wrong with what your SIL is doing. It's perfectly NORMAL. Put your jealousy away and let her enjoy her remaining pregnancy.", ">I told my SIL that it\u2019s pretty stupid to wash everything \n\n>My SIL\u2019s wife told me that \u201cwe are allowed to do things differently with our children.\u201d I pointed out to them that they\u2019ve never had children, so she\u2019s going to feel silly for doing [that washing].\n\n\nIf I were to defy my age and get pregnant with my third baby and anyone gave me clean hand-me-downs, I'd be washing them too. \n\nGet over yourself. People do things differently. You were extremely rude.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit to add. I think I read in one of your replies that you'd freshly washed the clothes - that they hadn't been stored for a while after laundering. If that's true and you handed over the bags while saying \"and I just washed them all yesterday\" and SIL still dumped it all in the washing machine in front of you, that would have been rude of her. **Many people would still wash them for a variety of reasons**, but that should be done without your knowledge if you'd gone to the trouble right before gifting. \n\nEven if that's closer to what happened, though, you were still incredibly condescending and judgemental about something that's purely individual choice.\n\nAnother edit to add.  I'm going to use an analogy to explain my previous addition further. Imagine my sister makes and brings me a casserole for me to use tomorrow because I've got a really busy day. She's sprinkled olives on the top as a garnish and I don't like olives or I don't want the extra calories or whatever. The polite thing to do is thank her and put the casserole in the fridge. It's totally understandable that I'd want to pick them off, but it is at least a little rude to do it right in front of her when there's no reason I couldn't do it later when she's not there. \n\nAnd again, OP is the AH, in case I need to say that again.", "YTA\n\nIt's her first baby, you know what it was like.

The tone of your post seems a little condescending towards her. You might have experience from having your kids, but if whatever she is doing has no impact on you, I don\u2019t see why you need to comment on it. Did it occur to you that she might enjoy cleaning? Could that be her way of prepping for her baby\u2019s arrival?", "YTA.  She\u2019s right, it better to over clean than under clean", "YTA.  How does this impact you?

I wouldn't have thrown it in the machine in front of you although I would definitely wash it.  You don't know if SIL has skin sensitivity or only uses free and clear detergent.

It\u2019s an instinct that affects many pregnant women near the end of their pregnancy.  It tells them that they need to get everything prepared before baby arrives: buy everything needed, clean, rearrange things, make anything they feel they need, etc.  Maybe it didn\u2019t hit you, but it sounds like your SIL is feeling it pretty strongly.  It\u2019s an instinct that varies between helpful and harmless, depending on how prepared the parent(s) already was/were.  But unless it goes to pathological extremes, it is at worst harmless.\n\nActing like that instinct is pointless and stupid - which is exactly what you were doing - is a hurtful response that does absolutely no good.  If we\u2019re going to talk about someone doing things that are not needed and cause harm, how about we look at your behavior?  You took offense at something that wasn\u2019t about you, you picked a fight with a heavily pregnant person over that, and then you repeatedly spoke down to her and her wife.", "Nobody likes a know it all.

Why were you so offended? All she did was what she has gotten into the habit of doing, probably even with her and her wife's clothing from stores or friends.\n\nJust because you know you washed things before showing them to them doesn't mean they know it's been washed.

New things are treated with preservative chemicals that are harsh in sensitive skin, even new clothes. Used things need washing a well, even if children are fully vaccinated, they might not be fully immune or even might carry vaccine preventable diseases and shed it on their belongings. If they're asymptomatic, there's no way of truly knowing. I still wash everything new or new to us before it touches mine or my child's skin. \n\nIt doesn't mean you're kids can't someday get good and dirty and pick up both harmless and harmful germs, they should! But a fever in a neonate is considered a medical emergency and it simply seems to me like your SIL knows this and you forgot or never knew in the first place. \n\nAlso, judging by your sister's reaction, they expect you to be condescending.

Were you really that offended or are you going through something personal that is unrelated?

I have three kids. My youngest just turned one, so I have a lot of baby stuff (baby swing, clothes, toys, etc) that we don\u2019t need anymore. Instead of donating them I thought it would be nice to let my SIL and her wife look at them before. \n\nI brought them over and they picked out what they wanted/needed and my SIL immediately put it in the washing machine. I\u2019m a very clean person, and all of the baby stuff was clean, so I confronted my SIL. I asked her why she needed to clean my stuff if it wasn\u2019t dirty, and she knows I\u2019m not dirty. My SIL said that she\u2019s cleaning everything and named a long list of things she\u2019s cleaning/cleaned for the baby (sterilized all bottles and pacifiers, washed all blankets, clothes, etc). I told my SIL that it\u2019s pretty stupid to wash everything because what if she wants to take something back, and it\u2019s not like cleaning everything in her house is going to make her prepared for her baby. Nothing prepares you for your first. \n\nMy SIL took this as me being mean, but I was trying to be helpful. She should enjoy her last few weeks of pregnancy instead of cleaning everything. My SIL\u2019s wife told me that \u201cwe are allowed to do things differently with our children.\u201d I pointed out to them that they\u2019ve never had children, so she\u2019s going to feel silly for doing.

She's being as thorough as she needs to be to give herself peace of mind as she waits for her first baby who's surely arriving any day now.
