My husband invited her to live with us, which I wasn\u2019t originally happy about because with the little one on the way I wanted time to focus on our family, but I ultimately understood that it\u2019s a special circumstance.\n\nThe problem is that MIL has really changed since she got here. We used to have a relatively good relationship, but she\u2019s increasingly been demanding and unreasonable. I know it\u2019s a hard time, so I\u2019ve tried to be accommodating, but it\u2019s all getting to be too much.\n\nFor example, she\u2019s been asking that we buy specific brands when getting groceries, which would be fine if they were just for her, but she\u2019s been insisting that the cereal brand we feed my kids isn\u2019t healthy and they have to eat a different brand. The one we buy is the one they like and it\u2019s not particularly unhealthy as far as cereals go. She\u2019s also been moving our furniture around, primarily the guest room that she\u2019s staying in but recently she had my husband swap the couch and the armchair in the living room while I was out running errands.\n\nAll this is fine, I love my husband and my MIL and can understand what she\u2019s going through, so I can deal with it.\n\nIt all finally came to a boiling point last night.\n\nMy husband and I have been having a disagreement lately. Usually, my husband makes his own lunch to take with him to work. However, since I\u2019ve recently quit my job to become a stay at home mom, he thinks I should start making his lunch along with the children\u2019s lunches. My husband goes to work an hour and a half before the children go to daycare. I currently wake up around the time he leaves for work and have plenty of time to get the kids ready and make their lunches. If I were to make his lunch, I would have to get up way earlier. We\u2019re at an impasse on this issue right now.\n\nApparently, he complained to his mother about it, because she confronted me last night about being a bad wife. In her words, I\u2019m \u201cnot good enough\u201d for her son if I can\u2019t even \u201cmake this one sacrifice to make him happy\u201d.\n\nBeing confronted like this just made me so mad and I don\u2019t even know why. I snapped and yelled back at her and said some things I regret.\n\nNow my husband expects me to give my MIL an apology and start packing his lunch, and neither of them are talking to me until then.\n\nMy husband and I have never had problems like this before. He\u2019s always been so good to me. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m overreacting and making and already difficult time even harder. I\u2019ve never snapped like that before but I just feel so overwhelmed and I don\u2019t have anyone in real life to talk to about this because my family doesn\u2019t understand my relationship with my husband and don\u2019t support us.\n\nReddit, WIBTA if I held my ground?", "created_utc": 1681125673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hfrdc/wibta_for_refusing_to_pack_my_husbands_lunch/", "score": 3154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A grown ass man who can't even make his own lunch is pathetic.", "NTA   \n\nYou and husband need to have a discussion so that both of you are on the same page on things. With his mother in the house he HAS to be 100% with you on anything that involves your team.   \nHe sounds as if he is going to run to mommy with everything and this must be stopped or her living there is going to ruin your marriage.  \n\nThe two of you and your children are the family unit here and you and your husband are the TEAM in charge of things.  \nMIL is an additional player- not running the house and not making demands.   \nShe lives there because of the team's generosity and anything she does to disrupt that TEAM is unacceptable.  \n\nBut until you get your husband to feel the same way there is going to be friction.  \n\nThis is not about packing lunches.   \nThis is about your husband taking sides and being influenced by his mom.  \n\n>Apparently, he complained to his mother about it, because she confronted me last night about being a bad wife.      \n\nHusband 100% in the wrong here and it needs to stop.    \n\n**This is your problem.**     \n\nHusband needs to understand what TEAM he plays for and not be complaining to his mommy OR allowing her to speak to his wife this way.  \n\nAnd clearly, you guys need to start making other arrangements for mommy- this is very likely only going to get worse.", ">Now my husband expects me to give my MIL an apology and start packing his lunch, and neither of them are talking to me until then.\n\nSo your husband recruited his mommy to his side over a minor disagreement, which piled onto a build up of a lot of tension his controlling mommy is causing in your home.

If you decide to make it, give him a kids meal - peanut butter sandwich, a cheese stick, and one cookie. If he\u2019s going to act like a little kid, he can eat like one. \n\n\nAs for MIL, she needs to be reminded that she\u2019s a guest in your home not a permanent resident.", "NTA\n\nSounds like MIL needs to get out of your house. \n\nWhatever\u2019s happened to change her circumstances isn\u2019t your problem, and her redirecting that frustration to managing your household isn\u2019t ok.\n\nAnd your husband should be backing you on this", "NTA.\n\n> he complained to his mother about it,\n\nSo he has become a momma's boy?   Something that goes wrong that he doesn't like he is running a mama.\n\nIf you were making everyone's lunches the night before and they just had to pull them out of the refrigerator then I would say go ahead and do it.\n\nbut trying to  force you, while you're pregnant with his third child, forcing you up earlier just to make his lunch cuz he's too bunch of a baby to make his own lunch?!?   Hell to the no.\n\nIf he wants to be such a mama's boy his mother can make his lunch...\n\nOr better yet she can get out of your house.... Does he have any other siblings that can take her in??", "NTA. Sounds like there is a reason your family doesn't like your husband. It also sounds like YOU are doing all the sacrificing and compromising in this relationship from what I can read. Don't pack his lunch, stop catering to his mother, and tell them both that they are welcome to leave if they aren't happy with it. You already have two children and another on the way, you don't need two more at home giving you headaches over petty issues.", "NTA-  Since it's so important to his mother, she can pack his lunch everyday.  Problem solved!", "You are literally growing a human inside of you and he wants to take away your sleep. That level of laziness is so unappealing. NTA", "NTA. MIL has got to go. Your husband is an adult who, like many other adults, can make his own lunch. \n\nYour husband should be loyal to you, not his mother. Can he not see that she's now causing problems in your marriage? Do not apologise and do not start making his lunch.", "NTA, however it might be a good idea to have a talk where you clarify what exactly your job as homemaker entails. Otherwise, it is a risk that task will continue being pushed to you that you feel isn't your job. This needn't be more than just vocalizing your existing consensus.\n\nBut if MIL continues whispering in ears, having had a frank conversation means you can go \"we talked about it, and agreed that wasn't my job. Do you want to swap chores?\"\n\nAlternatively, I like \"am I takling with you or your mother right now\" as a response.", "Absolutely NTA. You're a stay at home mum, not his mum. And if he wants his mum to pack his lunches, then (luckily- for only him) his mum lives there now too!", "YWNBTA. Why is this grown ass man insisting you make his lunch for him? Seems like having his mother around has resorted to him acting like a child and she\u2019s enabling that.", "YWNBTA - There is no reason why you should be packing your husband's lunch. He's an adult who is perfectly capable of doing it himself, and has time to do so. That is reason enough to stand your ground.\n\nYou also need to set some boundaries with your MIL. She is living in your house, but that doesn't mean that she can dictate what you buy and feed your kids, whether you make lunch for your husband etc. If you back down on this, it will be harder to set these boundaries which you clearly desperately need.\n\nIt was unacceptable of your MIL to say that you 'weren't good enough' for your husband. That's completely out of order. You don't need to apologise for being angry in response per se. However, depending on what you said in response and how you said it, there might possibly be a slight reason to apologise for those words in particular (you say that there was something that you regret saying), but be careful to make sure that it doesn't sound like you're saying \"I'm sorry I was angry\" or \"you're right, I wasn't being good enough\", as that is both untrue (you are good enough) and doesn't need apologising for (it was reasonable to be angry).\n\nCould you talk to your husband and say that you will apologise for saying those particular words that you regret only (but not apologise for being angry etc), but only if you can both set some boundaries for your MIL while she is staying in your house, and that you will not be making his lunch? I get the impression that this is not just whether or not you make your husband's lunch, and more about the way that your MIL treats you and the lack of boundaries.", "NTA\n\nhe is being an arse and then running to mummy who he has conveniently moved in.\n\nHis attitude is awful...you are pregnant and taking care of 2 kids...why should you baby him?", "NTA. Your MIL being on hard times isn't an excuse for her to overstep in your home and your marriage, all the more when she's benefitting off of your kindness by living under your roof. \n\nYour husband's demand is ridiculous in my opinion, I'd just laugh nonstop if my husband ever asked me to get up earlier than I need in order to make HIS lunch. I know the reasoning is that he is going to work while you stay home... but you stay home to take care of your (and in, yours and his) children, he's not providing you with a free ride through life. You don't owe him anything, just as he doesn't owe you anything. This is the agreement you guys decided would be best for your growing family. You being his PA isn't part of that. \n\nSnapping at your MIL might have been wrong (don't know exactly what you said to her but if you regret it, I guess you know you went too far), but being mad at her for sticking her nose in your marriage was justified. \n\nApologizing to her for snapping and saying hurtful things would be ok. But your husband and her expecting you to cave into the packing lunch argument as part of the apology is manipulative and ridiculous. \n\nIf your husband has always been a good partner, it's almost a given that the presence of his toxic mother in your home is causing him to deviate from his usual behavior. I would try and have a conversation with him about this and see if there is a way to help his mother out without having her there. Or a way for him to see the real issue and set firm boundaries with her. \n\nBut I would not start packing the lunches. Hell no.", "THey are both AHs so big. The two of them are a deadly combination. You are NOT overreacting, that is a big deal. Good for you that you held your ground.", "NTA for not making the lunch. but what did you say that you regret? And why don\u2019t your family understand your relationship with your husband?", "NTA. Sounds like your husband wants to have two mommies in his life instead of a wife. Tell him to grow up.", "NTA. Why the hell can't his mommy make his lunch the night before? I'm sure she knows how he likes his sandwiches cut.", "NTA. But why do the lunches in the morning, I do mine in the evening. Nothing worse than rushing in the morning.", "NTA and he should be asking his mommy to make his lunch for him since she\u2019s right there.", "\u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t consider compromise. MIL from now on you will pack husbands lunch. You can make mine too and I\u2019ve some addition chores for you since you want to stay in my house. Husband, I\u2019m sorry you confused me as the mother of your children with mother of you.\u2019\n\nNTA. They can go kick rocks. But seriously you need to have separate conversations with both around boundaries, respect and your MIL sticking her nose where it does not belong and interfering in your marriage. \nHusband needs a massive kick up the ass.

You now have 3 kids, so you pack 3 kids lunches. He can have exactly what they are having. You could even start writing loving notes about your special little boy, and put happy little faces on a cupcake. Don't forget the juicebox.", "NTA.

Good job, mom!", "I am referring specifically to the lunchbox disagreement, in that I strongly suspect that MIL is the one who had the idea that OP should be doing it in the first place. \n\nThis does not absolve the husband of his own steamrolling and failures to be a grown adult in a marriage. He\u2019s a huge AH for all of that too.", "Going outside the marriage to ANYONE, even the MIL herself, is a very toxic thing to do in a marriage. It makes her feel undermined, as if she 'went over her head to some boss'. \n\nIt's bad if a man still goes to his mother for input or to complain when he's a grown man.\n\nIt's 10x worse when he's a MARRIED man.\n\nIt's hugely disrespectful to the spouse and erodes trust faster than oven cleaner.", "Amazingly I did realize he doesn\u2019t live at the office.", "That\u2019s how it should be done. But for this ass hat extra Mayo and a big slice of tomato on the bread side of the meat. He will make his own after that.", "Totally.\n\nThing is though, no matter how badly someone outside of the couple is behaving - even MIL - it's the husbands duty to defend his wife in their home. Yeah, this stinks to high heaven.", "Yep.  I have questions.   OP what about your relationship with your husband is not understood by your family?  Why don't they support your marriage?  You are NTA for refusing to make a grown man's lunch.  But I think there's missing information here.  Also, you do realize your MIL is there to stay, right?  And that your husband will always put her before you and take her side.  If this isn't what you want, you'll have to start planning an exit route, because it's very unlikely that dynamic will change.", "She should and she should package it up like it\u2019s for a 5 yr old boy.  Print his name on the bag and put kiddie stickers on it and have kiddie containers wet in it.", "I mean, just to play devil's advocate... It *could* simply be an age gap thing. It's not huge at their ages *now* but six years ago when she got pregnant and was 23 dating a man in his thirties? That's pretty significant, not to mention how long they had been dating before that..\n\nLike. Probably more than that, but maybe not.", "Seriously. I am a sahm, and I will pack up dinner leftovers in a single-serve storage container for my husband\u2019s lunch if I\u2019m the one doing dinner cleanup, but it would literally never occur to either of us that I would regularly pack his lunch under other circumstances. He also *gasp* frequently packs out kids\u2019 school lunches.", "I also go NTA, but my question is. If it's never been a problem before, what's the likelihood that MIL put the thought about her doing his lunch and stuff in his head?", "Literally I would think he was joking.\n\nLike it's the kind of thing my partner and I might joke about, 'Oh I wanna sleep in tomorrow can you just make me lunch like I'm one of the kids', but never actually seriously request \ud83d\ude33", "Yep - what are the details around her losing her apartment? Id want to know what actually happened here because I get the feeling she just didnt renew her lease", "I wonder if MIL is pulling her weight in the household as thanks for letting them stay with her (although my worry is even if she did housework, she's use it to find fault with OP and change things to \\*her\\* way of doing things). IMHO if you stay longer than a month you're not just a guest anymore and you're gonna get chores.", "Day care isnt all day (often half days) and im sure OP has a heap to do running a household of 5 people on top of being pregnant. SAHM who pop their kids in daycare arent sitting around drinking coffees and socialising all day.", "Yeah real silly how people are seemingly getting gender norms triggers in this thread. If the man is going out to work and spending the bulk of the income on the family and making the wife happy, I don't see why she wouldn't return the favour", "You\u2019re not understanding the point that he expects her to get up before her children get up to pack him a lunch. Her husband leaves hours before anyone needs to be up in the morning. That\u2019s not cooking him a meal, that\u2019s him expecting her to wake up earlier than she normally would need to to pack him a lunch while he waits to leave for work. How does that make any sense? He has been packing his own lunch but he and his mother decided she\u2019s not good enough for him because she doesn\u2019t do this. That\u2019s not a mutually respectful relationship, that\u2019s expecting someone to serve you.", "Agreed\u2026or make his lunch the night before", "There are plenty of SAHM who also have a cleaning service to clean their homes.", "You can get washable side containers! I\u2019d MUCH rather do an extra tiny dish than wake up early \ud83d\ude02 but I\u2019m NOT a morning person at all", "Also, her parents don't support the relationship. Me thinks they saw him for what he is.", "I hate those posts that are just such an EASY \n\nhold your ground, kick your MIL out, and your husband makes his own lunch, OR, take the kids and divorce him......but damn. \n\nOP NTA and i'm sorry the obvious answer is that your husband is being downright awful to you.", "Good suggestion, thanks!  I have learned so much useful information on AITA.  I come here as much for the lifestyle hints and help as I do to ride up on my high horse and pronounce people assholes. \ud83e\udd23", "I don't think she has noticed how he isolated her.  A friend of mine married a man who was so great at manipulation that it took years for her to catch on. He would do things like surprise her with  tickets to Europe, and oops, they're nonrefundable and just  happened  to be the same weekend as her parent's anniversary party! \n\nBooking a super fancy hotel far away, knowing bad weather was predicted, and then she missed Christmas with her family bc it wasn't safe to drive. \n\nSomehow, something magically prevented her from spending any time with friends or family until they were all fed up. But he convinced her it was all complete coincidences", "Thank you!", "What's wrong with helping a spouse out? People are so selfish nowadays.  God forbid she fix her husband's lunch. She's home all day not working while her husband provides for the family. Her making the lunch the night before cost her nothing.", "NTA you need to find a time to calmly talk to your husband about how allowing your MIL to live with you is a huge sacrifice that has made your workload MUCH harder, and he needs to be finding ways to support you and take stress off your shoulders during this pregnancy (and your mother's living time with you) not keep adding to it.\n\nHe is a husband and a father and he needs to step up. Now is not the time for him to be pushing you back into the 1950s.", "Ur husband is not a child. He can use his delicate hands to make a sandwich for lunch, he's being dramatic af. Especially crying to mummy about it holy shit. NTA", "NTA. His mommy can pack his lunch if she\u2019s so worried about it.", "Make his lunch the night before. If your husband affords you the luxury of being a SAH mum, then it is reasonable that he gets his lunch made.  But do tell MiL to fuck right off and hubby to stop involving  his mother in your marriage. Two people in a marriage not three.", "Exactly. That last line struck me that there is more going on here with the husband. This sounds like tip of the iceberg.", "I'd pack him a tomato sandwich the night before so it's nice and soggy and gross for him.", "Glad you posted this. I was kind of wondering why everyone was going so hard at the husband\u2026. the mother in law situation seems awful, no doubt, but we don\u2019t really know if they\u2019ve had conversations about the new dynamic and expectations. \n\nAlso, is he working longer hours to accommodate the new baby or the extra family member? Maybe he\u2019s not doing well with the new changes, is feeling additionally stressed and need extra support? His feelings should be recognized as well (but we don\u2019t know with the given post and that\u2019s okay- i hope they sort it out), but I do not agree that he should have confided in his mom before his wife.", "I really was looking out for this comment!", "He can pack his own lunch the night before.", "Kind of telling that OP never commented on this post\u2026", "Triangles too, just how he likes them!", "I have never once seen a situation where a mil moving in has worked out well. And I'm no spring chicken. \n\nThe furniture moving already shows that she doesn't respect OP'S boundaries. \n\nOP, do what you can to get her out. She needs to go.\n\nAnd has the husband not heard of Lean Cuisine?", "So if your significant other asked you to make them lunch while you stay at home, your response would be why is this grown ass man/woman asking me to make him/her lunch? I sincerely doubt it.", "Is the MIL working? Or is OP in the house with her during the day? I assume MIL is living there rent free? If so, she needs to start chipping in for groceries and bills and pulling her weight in relation to housework and making her baby boy's samwitches with the crusty wustys cut off.", "You\u2019re deliberately not understanding the issue. He has never asked her to make his lunch, has now flipped that standard and is expecting her to get up earlier to make his lunch and then again, has gotten HIS MOTHER to try and bully her into it. Everyone saying \u201cjust make it the night before\u201d has no idea about this woman\u2019s nighttime routine, she has two kids under 5, and is making wild assumptions about the labour she does during the day (which stay at home parents do a TONNE of invisible and unpaid labour). Not to mention, she\u2019s PREGNANT. \n\nSo to answer your question, if my significant other asked me to make lunch in this situation, I\u2019d tell him absolutely the fuck not.", "She literally says she just quit job and is staying at home which is why he has now asked to make his lunch. He didn\u2019t say mother in law told me you should make my lunches, he just went to complain to her after she said no. \n\nIf I can easily help my significant other by preparing a sandwich and snacks in a bag, I just think I\u2019d gladly do it without even thinking cause why wouldn\u2019t I want to make their life a little easier?", "As if she's ever moving out", "Did you miss the part where she\u2019s pregnant or do you just like to consume information that suits your argument?

Shes let someone else dictate the food and the position of furniture in her own house.", "Bruh she is growing a human inside of her, it\u2019s not like to quit her job out of laziness lol she is equally contributing to the household already by raising young children and doing the housework. He\u2019s a grown ass man, he can make his lunch the night before.", "If OP wants to pack lunches for her husband, it should be her choice, not his demand. It's not okay for a grown man to demand that his wife gets up an hour and a half earlier to pack his lunch, because they agreed on OP quitting her job to become a SAHM to take care of their (soon to be) three children. It seems that OP's husband is very confused and thinks the M in SAHM stand for his personal Maid.\r  \n\r  \nJoking aside, I'm very concerned about OP being cornered in a position she doesn't want to be in. It's very worrying that he chooses his mother over his wife. His sudden prehistoric ideas about what a wife should be and do are also concerning.
