My husband invited her to live with us, which I wasn\u2019t originally happy about because with the little one on the way I wanted time to focus on our family, but I ultimately understood that it\u2019s a special circumstance.\n\nThe problem is that MIL has really changed since she got here. We used to have a relatively good relationship, but she\u2019s increasingly been demanding and unreasonable. I know it\u2019s a hard time, so I\u2019ve tried to be accommodating, but it\u2019s all getting to be too much.\n\nFor example, she\u2019s been asking that we buy specific brands when getting groceries, which would be fine if they were just for her, but she\u2019s been insisting that the cereal brand we feed my kids isn\u2019t healthy and they have to eat a different brand. The one we buy is the one they like and it\u2019s not particularly unhealthy as far as cereals go. She\u2019s also been moving our furniture around, primarily the guest room that she\u2019s staying in but recently she had my husband swap the couch and the armchair in the living room while I was out running errands.\n\nAll this is fine, I love my husband and my MIL and can understand what she\u2019s going through, so I can deal with it.\n\nIt all finally came to a boiling point last night.\n\nMy husband and I have been having a disagreement lately. Usually, my husband makes his own lunch to take with him to work. However, since I\u2019ve recently quit my job to become a stay at home mom, he thinks I should start making his lunch along with the children\u2019s lunches. My husband goes to work an hour and a half before the children go to daycare. I currently wake up around the time he leaves for work and have plenty of time to get the kids ready and make their lunches. If I were to make his lunch, I would have to get up way earlier. We\u2019re at an impasse on this issue right now.\n\nApparently, he complained to his mother about it, because she confronted me last night about being a bad wife. In her words, I\u2019m \u201cnot good enough\u201d for her son if I can\u2019t even \u201cmake this one sacrifice to make him happy\u201d.\n\nBeing confronted like this just made me so mad and I don\u2019t even know why. I snapped and yelled back at her and said some things I regret.\n\nNow my husband expects me to give my MIL an apology and start packing his lunch, and neither of them are talking to me until then.\n\nMy husband and I have never had problems like this before. He\u2019s always been so good to me. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m overreacting and making and already difficult time even harder. I\u2019ve never snapped like that before but I just feel so overwhelmed and I don\u2019t have anyone in real life to talk to about this because my family doesn\u2019t understand my relationship with my husband and don\u2019t support us.\n\nReddit, WIBTA if I held my ground?", "created_utc": 1681125673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hfrdc/wibta_for_refusing_to_pack_my_husbands_lunch/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A grown ass man who can't even make his own lunch is pathetic.", "NTA   \n\nYou and husband need to have a discussion so that both of you are on the same page on things. With his mother in the house he HAS to be 100% with you on anything that involves your team.   \nHe sounds as if he is going to run to mommy with everything and this must be stopped or her living there is going to ruin your marriage.  \n\nThe two of you and your children are the family unit here and you and your husband are the TEAM in charge of things.  \nMIL is an additional player- not running the house and not making demands.   \nShe lives there because of the team's generosity and anything she does to disrupt that TEAM is unacceptable.  \n\nBut until you get your husband to feel the same way there is going to be friction.  \n\nThis is not about packing lunches.   \nThis is about your husband taking sides and being influenced by his mom.  \n\n>Apparently, he complained to his mother about it, because she confronted me last night about being a bad wife.      \n\nHusband 100% in the wrong here and it needs to stop.    \n\n**This is your problem.**     \n\nHusband needs to understand what TEAM he plays for and not be complaining to his mommy OR allowing her to speak to his wife this way.  \n\nAnd clearly, you guys need to start making other arrangements for mommy- this is very likely only going to get worse.", ">Now my husband expects me to give my MIL an apology and start packing his lunch, and neither of them are talking to me until then.\n\nSo your husband recruited his mommy to his side over a minor disagreement, which piled onto a build up of a lot of tension his controlling mommy is causing in your home.

If you decide to make it, give him a kids meal - peanut butter sandwich, a cheese stick, and one cookie. If he\u2019s going to act like a little kid, he can eat like one. \n\n\nAs for MIL, she needs to be reminded that she\u2019s a guest in your home not a permanent resident.", "NTA\n\nSounds like MIL needs to get out of your house. \n\nWhatever\u2019s happened to change her circumstances isn\u2019t your problem, and her redirecting that frustration to managing your household isn\u2019t ok.\n\nAnd your husband should be backing you on this", "NTA.\n\n> he complained to his mother about it,\n\nSo he has become a momma's boy?   Something that goes wrong that he doesn't like he is running a mama.\n\nIf you were making everyone's lunches the night before and they just had to pull them out of the refrigerator then I would say go ahead and do it.\n\nbut trying to  force you, while you're pregnant with his third child, forcing you up earlier just to make his lunch cuz he's too bunch of a baby to make his own lunch?!?   Hell to the no.\n\nIf he wants to be such a mama's boy his mother can make his lunch...\n\nOr better yet she can get out of your house.... Does he have any other siblings that can take her in??", "NTA. Sounds like there is a reason your family doesn't like your husband. It also sounds like YOU are doing all the sacrificing and compromising in this relationship from what I can read. Don't pack his lunch, stop catering to his mother, and tell them both that they are welcome to leave if they aren't happy with it. You already have two children and another on the way, you don't need two more at home giving you headaches over petty issues.", "NTA-  Since it's so important to his mother, she can pack his lunch everyday.  Problem solved!", "You are literally growing a human inside of you and he wants to take away your sleep. That level of laziness is so unappealing. NTA", "NTA. MIL has got to go. Your husband is an adult who, like many other adults, can make his own lunch. \n\nYour husband should be loyal to you, not his mother. Can he not see that she's now causing problems in your marriage? Do not apologise and do not start making his lunch.", "NTA, however it might be a good idea to have a talk where you clarify what exactly your job as homemaker entails. Otherwise, it is a risk that task will continue being pushed to you that you feel isn't your job. This needn't be more than just vocalizing your existing consensus.\n\nBut if MIL continues whispering in ears, having had a frank conversation means you can go \"we talked about it, and agreed that wasn't my job. Do you want to swap chores?\"\n\nAlternatively, I like \"am I takling with you or your mother right now\" as a response.", "Absolutely NTA. You're a stay at home mum, not his mum. And if he wants his mum to pack his lunches, then (luckily- for only him) his mum lives there now too!", "YWNBTA. Why is this grown ass man insisting you make his lunch for him? Seems like having his mother around has resorted to him acting like a child and she\u2019s enabling that.", "YWNBTA - There is no reason why you should be packing your husband's lunch. He's an adult who is perfectly capable of doing it himself, and has time to do so. That is reason enough to stand your ground.\n\nYou also need to set some boundaries with your MIL. She is living in your house, but that doesn't mean that she can dictate what you buy and feed your kids, whether you make lunch for your husband etc. If you back down on this, it will be harder to set these boundaries which you clearly desperately need.\n\nIt was unacceptable of your MIL to say that you 'weren't good enough' for your husband. That's completely out of order. You don't need to apologise for being angry in response per se. However, depending on what you said in response and how you said it, there might possibly be a slight reason to apologise for those words in particular (you say that there was something that you regret saying), but be careful to make sure that it doesn't sound like you're saying \"I'm sorry I was angry\" or \"you're right, I wasn't being good enough\", as that is both untrue (you are good enough) and doesn't need apologising for (it was reasonable to be angry).\n\nCould you talk to your husband and say that you will apologise for saying those particular words that you regret only (but not apologise for being angry etc), but only if you can both set some boundaries for your MIL while she is staying in your house, and that you will not be making his lunch? I get the impression that this is not just whether or not you make your husband's lunch, and more about the way that your MIL treats you and the lack of boundaries.", "NTA\n\nhe is being an arse and then running to mummy who he has conveniently moved in.\n\nHis attitude is awful...you are pregnant and taking care of 2 kids...why should you baby him?", "NTA. Your MIL being on hard times isn't an excuse for her to overstep in your home and your marriage, all the more when she's benefitting off of your kindness by living under your roof. \n\nYour husband's demand is ridiculous in my opinion, I'd just laugh nonstop if my husband ever asked me to get up earlier than I need in order to make HIS lunch. I know the reasoning is that he is going to work while you stay home... but you stay home to take care of your (and in, yours and his) children, he's not providing you with a free ride through life. You don't owe him anything, just as he doesn't owe you anything. This is the agreement you guys decided would be best for your growing family. You being his PA isn't part of that. \n\nSnapping at your MIL might have been wrong (don't know exactly what you said to her but if you regret it, I guess you know you went too far), but being mad at her for sticking her nose in your marriage was justified. \n\nApologizing to her for snapping and saying hurtful things would be ok. But your husband and her expecting you to cave into the packing lunch argument as part of the apology is manipulative and ridiculous. \n\nIf your husband has always been a good partner, it's almost a given that the presence of his toxic mother in your home is causing him to deviate from his usual behavior. I would try and have a conversation with him about this and see if there is a way to help his mother out without having her there. Or a way for him to see the real issue and set firm boundaries with her. \n\nBut I would not start packing the lunches. Hell no.", "THey are both AHs so big. The two of them are a deadly combination. You are NOT overreacting, that is a big deal. Good for you that you held your ground.", "NTA for not making the lunch. but what did you say that you regret? And why don\u2019t your family understand your relationship with your husband?", "NTA. Sounds like your husband wants to have two mommies in his life instead of a wife. Tell him to grow up.", "NTA. Why the hell can't his mommy make his lunch the night before? I'm sure she knows how he likes his sandwiches cut.", "NTA. But why do the lunches in the morning, I do mine in the evening. Nothing worse than rushing in the morning.", "NTA and he should be asking his mommy to make his lunch for him since she\u2019s right there.", "\u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t consider compromise. MIL from now on you will pack husbands lunch. You can make mine too and I\u2019ve some addition chores for you since you want to stay in my house. Husband, I\u2019m sorry you confused me as the mother of your children with mother of you.\u2019\n\nNTA. They can go kick rocks. But seriously you need to have separate conversations with both around boundaries, respect and your MIL sticking her nose where it does not belong and interfering in your marriage. \nHusband needs a massive kick up the ass.

Have they witnessed something in your relationship that's concerning?\n\nI will say if you concede on this issue with H/MIL there will be numerous others that they will tag team you in until you concede. \n\nTake care of you and your children and try to find someone that you can confide in.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, I suggest a little bit of malicious compliance. You now have 3 kids, so you pack 3 kids lunches. He can have exactly what they are having. You could even start writing loving notes about your special little boy, and put happy little faces on a cupcake. Don't forget the juicebox.", "NTA.

When I make two sandwiches, it takes 5.\n\nObviously y'all need to get smarter about how you're making those sandwiches.", "Completely ignoring his contributions.", "But, again, she's not making the sandwiches then. So she'd still have to wake up earlier to accommodate making his sandwiches (like he's a lickle baby). So it isn't the effort of 1 minute, is it? You're ignoring the real issue.\n\nAlso, do you know that he has the same sandwiches as the kids?", "Not ignoring them. They're the same. He's not an asshole for not making lunch for her. She's not an asshole for not making lunch for him. They each do their part for the family they decided to build.", "I work long hours and can make my own meals just fine, thank you :) Just like ANY adult with common sense can", "Respectfully, I believe you're ignoring the real problem: we have a hard working man in need of lunches.", "Hahahahahahahahaha. Oh yes, because a hard working man isn't capable of spending 1 minute on something in the morning? (As you're hell bent on thinking it only takes a minute). Should someone be making sandwiches for the hard working woman too? Or is it the penis that prevents him from putting fillings in bread?", "Respectfully, he is expecting a hard-working woman who is looking after a kindergartener and a toddler all day, and also pregnant, to get up two hours earlier than needed in order to make him lunch. \n\nWhen he has been doing it himself up until now. \n\nHe's perfectly capable of making his own damn lunch and go to work, just like he's been doing. He just thinks he's now entitled to have his wife cater to him because she quit her job to stay home and raise the children HE HAS WITH HER.", "Obviously he can make his own sandwiches. That's not the issue.\n\nEhy doesn't a hard working man, bringing home the bacon, deserve a little BLT?", "She's perfectly capable as well.", "He may deserve a BLT. But he doesn't need his wife to act like his mummy and make it for him. If he wants his mummy to do it, she lives there now too. What is she doing to help them while she mooches off them and gets in the wife's way?\n\nIf you just don't consider childcare work, why not just say it?", "So is the neighbor. Should she make this guy's lunch, then? \n\nShe has no obligation nor need to make a grown ass man his lunch. It's his lunch, he can make it. Like every other functional adult does."]}
