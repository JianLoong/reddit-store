We had several guests over and I was in full hostess mode cooking/filling glasses/cleaning/chatting. I was filling the tea kettle and noticed my bedroom door was open. I live in an open concept house and the primary bedroom suite is off of the living room, but I had kept the door shut. The guest bathroom is by the entrance and I left the door open so I could tell guests where it was when they came in. I also have two bedrooms near the entrance (a guest room and office) and left the doors open and had people put their coats on the guest bed. The only door that was kept shut was to my bedroom, which I thought was the universal sign for \"keep out\". Compared to the rest of the house, my bedroom is a lot messier--I temporarily relocated a bunch of stuff to the room and had some fresh laundry on the bed I didn't have time to fold. My bathroom and closest was a disaster from a very full weekend of parties--I kept the door shut to hide my shame. So, when I saw the door open I panicked. I ran over and saw that my aunt and her new boyfriend were standing in the bathroom with the lights on. I told her the bathroom was messy and the guest bathroom was a lot tidier, and she said she only wanted to show her boyfriend my walk-in closet. I said \"can you please not? It's messy and I don't want people in here\". And they left. Later, after most guests had left, my aunt privately told me I let the \"stress of hosting\" get to me and embarrased myself and her. She said her boyfriend has to sit on her cat hair-covered couch all the time and that a full laundry hamper and some pantyhose are nothing to freak out over. I don't think I freaked out, but I was stressed and that might have come out in my tone. What she said also made me think: I did invite people to my house, so maybe I was being unreasonable in trying to keep guests out of certain rooms? I don't know if my parents told me this or I just picked it up, but if a door is closed I don't go in without knocking/ getting permission--but is that the norm?\n\nTLDR: I might be an asshole for getting upset about guests going into my closed bedroom during a party.", "created_utc": 1703571929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r1rib/aita_for_getting_upset_about_my_aunt_and_her/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's common courtesy that when you're in someone's home you don't open closed doors (or at least not without first asking if it's ok), and you use the bathroom that the host says you can use. It's normal to feel more stressed when guests misbehave like your aunt did. She could have asked you if it was ok for her to do that, and only done it if you said it was ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might want to check for stains and re-Wash.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt and BF were looking for drugs or something else they could steal.  \n\nNormal people don't go into rooms with closed doors or hang out in the bathroom that is off-limits.", "NTA\nWho does your aunt think she os inviting a mam into your bedroom without your permission?  That's very invasive and is definitely not noal behavior.  My policy is to lock bedrooms/doors I don't want people to have access to. It's weird that she thought this would be ok,  you have every right to be upset about this.", "NTA. Your aunt may have wanted to show her boyfriend your closest but she failed to consider the fact you didn't want him to see it. Her invasion of your privacy was well out of order. And she certainly overstepped the mark in reprimanding you for asking them to get out of your private space.", "NTA\n\nEven if she only wanted to show him the walk in closet, it's inappropriate to go helping yourself to closed doors in someone's house. They were looking for something or else they wouldn't have been in there. \n\nYour aunt is embarrassed she was caught snooping. Check your stuff and make sure nothing was taken.", "apparently you need a lock on your door to keep nosy relatives out. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. She embarrassed herself. At minimum she was being rude, at worst... several options that others here have suggested. You don't need a 'good enough' reason for your bedroom to be off limits when you're hosting - the fact that it's your private space should be enough. Good guests respect their host, and stay in places where they've been told they can go.", "NTA at all. Indeed it is a clear sign to keep out. \n\nI would suggest a doorknob with a code or fingerprint pad that allows you to lock it from the outside. We got ours on Amazon and can rest easy knowing our guests aren\u2019t going to stroll into our bedroom while in our house.", "NTA- it\u2019s incredibly rude as a guest in someone\u2019s house to go into their bedroom without their expressed permission.", "Your aunt and her bf are rude af to go into your bedroom to be nosy. If she wanted to show him your walk in closet she should've asked", "I agree with you. She knew it was your bedroom, and the door was closed. A normal person would refrain from entering. NTA", "NTA.\n\nCheck your stuff and make sure nothing has been messed with.", "NTA. Nobody wants their relatives to have a quickie in their room. They had no other reason other than stealing to be in there. Forget your aunts invite next year.", "NTA. But your aunt or her boyfriend wanted to look in your medicine cabinet. Which is usually in the master bath where you said the light was on and you found them standing in. Check for anything missing.\n\nIt's also why she's tried to deflect the situation to be you that did wrong.", "NTA you didn't yell or get mad. You just asked them to not look through your bedroom. That's very reasonable. If you had yelled or gotten mad then that would be a different story (and still wouldn't be entirely on you even if you had!).\n\nThe fact your aunt even waited around to say something is the annoying part. She embarrassed herself and wants to make you feel bad about it. Don't.", "NTA. I\u2019m cynical and spend a lot of time on here; so I would check your stuff (medicines, jewelry, clothes, valuables, etc) to see if anything is missing or looks gone through. \n\nIt is NOT normal for going through rooms when at someone else\u2019s house. The rule for visitors is bedrooms off limits and any door that\u2019s closed stays closed and guests stay out unless specifically given permission. \n\n\nAunt maybe wanted to hook up with her bf, still makes you NTA.", "NTA. If I am invited to you home as a guest, then I'm invited to enter the house and enjoy the open spaces you've alotted for your guests to use. I don't get to go wherever I want and enter whichever rooms I want to tour without permission--especially if the door to the room is closed.  The door of a closed room in a house is a universal sign the room is off-limits unless the host or whomever resides in the room has given permission to go in there.  Out of courtesy, I will always knock on closed doors before entering.  Your aunt is rude.  Whatever your reasons to keep certain rooms off-limits to your party guests are yours.  As a guest, I don't get to decide if your reasons are warranted or not.  Your house, your rules, your boundaries.", "Your aunt needs to think up better lies! Why would her new bf need or want to see your walk-in closet. Seeing someone's walk-in closet doesn't usually make the top 10 highlights of a dinner party!  Also, IF that was the reason they invaded your private space, what were they doing in your en-suite and not marvelling over your tour-worthy walk-in closet? Very suspicious, indeed.\n\nI don't know if my parents told me this or I just picked it up, but if a door is closed I don't go in without knocking/ getting permission--but is that the norm?\n\nClosed doors are closed for myriad reasons and knocking and asking permission to open them and enter the room is considered good manners and definitely the norm.\n\n\". . . my aunt privately told me I let the \"stress of hosting\" get to me and embarrased myself and her.\"\n\nNo, she embarrassed herself by intruding into a room that was clearly meant to be off limits. She is trying to shame you to lessen her rudeness.\n\nYour aunt belongs on the naughty list for next year and definitely off your guest list.\n\nNTA, can't say the same about your aunt or her new bf.", "NTA.  A closed door IS a universal sign not to enter that room.  If your aunt wanted to show her bf your closet (wtf for, anyway?), she should have *asked* first.  It doesn\u2019t matter if her place is usually messy.  You didn\u2019t want people seeing YOUR mess, in YOUR home, so YOU are the only one who gets to make that decision.  Being a party guest in someone else\u2019s home doesn\u2019t give you carte blanche to invade their privacy.", "NTA\n\nIf a door is shut in a home it means to stay out of that room. I have never heard of someone casually walking into someone's home and just going into closed rooms...", "NTA. Even if the bedroom had been spotlessly tidy, no guests should enter it unless invited by you. I don\u2019t even allow guests upstairs in my own house and my bedroom is completely off limits to everyone except my children. I think you were very polite and your aunt just doesn\u2019t like being told what to do, it\u2019s her problem.", "Perhaps they had another motive, but that\u2019s the kind of behavior that screams \u201ccasing the joint.\u201d  People keep their medications in their master bath, guns, valuables, sex toys, whatever else is not meant for other house occupants in their closet.  Your aunt and new boyfriend had no legitimate need to be in your room without your consent.  I\u2019d be checking to see if anything was missing.", "NTA. Shut door is a clear sign, so is the Master bedroom being off limits.  It's not up to her to decide what is and is not a big deal to you. State a clear boundary for her, since she doesn't get social norms. She's embarrassed she got called out on bad behavior, she doesn't get to tell you you're embarrassed, stand tall knowing you spoke up for yourself in your own home.", "Probably hoping for \"a quickie\", and almost got caught with their pants down!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP NTA", "Also how would he not be offended by panty hose and dirty laundry if he was somehow uncomfortable with a couch that had some cat hair on it?  The aunt is the AH for sure", "I think you nailed it.", "I agree but maybe not everyone has experience with addicts. I have a relative who I love dearly but if she\u2019s coming over any pain medication gets locked up in my car or left at my neighbors. I swear she could smell the stuff", "You're right that a closed door in someone else's home *should* be a universal sign to knock or get permission before entering and the aunt was indeed in the wrong.\n\nOP didn't get mad or yell or anything, either, so definitely NTA. It sounds like she didn't let her guests know upon entering her home that the bedroom was off limits. I'm not saying that justifies anyone walking in, but just saying that IF she had yelled at them after not making it clear it was off limits, *then* maybe she'd be entering y t a territory. Maaaybe. That's not how it happened though so it's not even close.", "I also thought it was pretty standard not to enter people's  bedrooms unless explicitly invited, regardless if the door is closed. Respecting people's personal space seems pretty basic imo. Op, nta", "You just know \u201cshowing the closet\u201d is an implausible off the charts line of BS.", "Absolutely right.  Highly suspicious at the very least.  This is some serious breach of the very basic boundaries.", "It\u2019s SO rude to go in someone\u2019s bedroom without asking / being invited. Even my friends and family wouldn\u2019t go into me bedroom during a party or event without asking. I know this because I\u2019ve just hosted Christmas and anytime the guest bathroom was in use people would explicitly ask if they could use our en suite!"]}
