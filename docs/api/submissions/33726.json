{"id": 33726, "submission_id": "18r1rib", "title": "AITA for getting upset about my aunt and her boyfriend going into my bedroom", "selftext": "I was hosting Christmas day dinner at my house for the 3rd time. We had several guests over and I was in full hostess mode cooking/filling glasses/cleaning/chatting. I was filling the tea kettle and noticed my bedroom door was open. I live in an open concept house and the primary bedroom suite is off of the living room, but I had kept the door shut. The guest bathroom is by the entrance and I left the door open so I could tell guests where it was when they came in. I also have two bedrooms near the entrance (a guest room and office) and left the doors open and had people put their coats on the guest bed. The only door that was kept shut was to my bedroom, which I thought was the universal sign for \"keep out\". Compared to the rest of the house, my bedroom is a lot messier--I temporarily relocated a bunch of stuff to the room and had some fresh laundry on the bed I didn't have time to fold. My bathroom and closest was a disaster from a very full weekend of parties--I kept the door shut to hide my shame. So, when I saw the door open I panicked. I ran over and saw that my aunt and her new boyfriend were standing in the bathroom with the lights on. I told her the bathroom was messy and the guest bathroom was a lot tidier, and she said she only wanted to show her boyfriend my walk-in closet. I said \"can you please not? It's messy and I don't want people in here\". And they left. Later, after most guests had left, my aunt privately told me I let the \"stress of hosting\" get to me and embarrased myself and her. She said her boyfriend has to sit on her cat hair-covered couch all the time and that a full laundry hamper and some pantyhose are nothing to freak out over. I don't think I freaked out, but I was stressed and that might have come out in my tone. What she said also made me think: I did invite people to my house, so maybe I was being unreasonable in trying to keep guests out of certain rooms? I don't know if my parents told me this or I just picked it up, but if a door is closed I don't go in without knocking/ getting permission--but is that the norm?\n\nTLDR: I might be an asshole for getting upset about guests going into my closed bedroom during a party.", "created_utc": 1703571929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r1rib/aita_for_getting_upset_about_my_aunt_and_her/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If everything were tidy, you would've been okay with your aunt entering a closed room & showing your closet without asking?", "NTA. It's common courtesy that when you're in someone's home you don't open closed doors (or at least not without first asking if it's ok), and you use the bathroom that the host says you can use. It's normal to feel more stressed when guests misbehave like your aunt did. She could have asked you if it was ok for her to do that, and only done it if you said it was ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
