You might want to check for stains and re-Wash.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt and BF were looking for drugs or something else they could steal.  \n\nNormal people don't go into rooms with closed doors or hang out in the bathroom that is off-limits.", "NTA\nWho does your aunt think she os inviting a mam into your bedroom without your permission?  That's very invasive and is definitely not noal behavior.  My policy is to lock bedrooms/doors I don't want people to have access to. It's weird that she thought this would be ok,  you have every right to be upset about this.", "NTA. Your aunt may have wanted to show her boyfriend your closest but she failed to consider the fact you didn't want him to see it. Her invasion of your privacy was well out of order. And she certainly overstepped the mark in reprimanding you for asking them to get out of your private space.", "NTA\n\nEven if she only wanted to show him the walk in closet, it's inappropriate to go helping yourself to closed doors in someone's house. They were looking for something or else they wouldn't have been in there. \n\nYour aunt is embarrassed she was caught snooping. Check your stuff and make sure nothing was taken.", "apparently you need a lock on your door to keep nosy relatives out. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. She embarrassed herself. At minimum she was being rude, at worst... several options that others here have suggested. You don't need a 'good enough' reason for your bedroom to be off limits when you're hosting - the fact that it's your private space should be enough. Good guests respect their host, and stay in places where they've been told they can go.", "NTA at all. Indeed it is a clear sign to keep out. \n\nI would suggest a doorknob with a code or fingerprint pad that allows you to lock it from the outside. We got ours on Amazon and can rest easy knowing our guests aren\u2019t going to stroll into our bedroom while in our house.", "NTA- it\u2019s incredibly rude as a guest in someone\u2019s house to go into their bedroom without their expressed permission.", "Your aunt and her bf are rude af to go into your bedroom to be nosy. If she wanted to show him your walk in closet she should've asked", "I agree with you. She knew it was your bedroom, and the door was closed. A normal person would refrain from entering. NTA", "NTA.\n\nCheck your stuff and make sure nothing has been messed with.", "NTA. Nobody wants their relatives to have a quickie in their room. They had no other reason other than stealing to be in there. Forget your aunts invite next year.", "NTA. But your aunt or her boyfriend wanted to look in your medicine cabinet. Which is usually in the master bath where you said the light was on and you found them standing in. Check for anything missing.\n\nIt's also why she's tried to deflect the situation to be you that did wrong.", "NTA you didn't yell or get mad. You just asked them to not look through your bedroom. That's very reasonable. If you had yelled or gotten mad then that would be a different story (and still wouldn't be entirely on you even if you had!).\n\nThe fact your aunt even waited around to say something is the annoying part. She embarrassed herself and wants to make you feel bad about it. Don't.", "NTA. I\u2019m cynical and spend a lot of time on here; so I would check your stuff (medicines, jewelry, clothes, valuables, etc) to see if anything is missing or looks gone through. \n\nIt is NOT normal for going through rooms when at someone else\u2019s house. The rule for visitors is bedrooms off limits and any door that\u2019s closed stays closed and guests stay out unless specifically given permission. \n\n\nAunt maybe wanted to hook up with her bf, still makes you NTA.", "NTA. If I am invited to you home as a guest, then I'm invited to enter the house and enjoy the open spaces you've alotted for your guests to use. I don't get to go wherever I want and enter whichever rooms I want to tour without permission--especially if the door to the room is closed.  The door of a closed room in a house is a universal sign the room is off-limits unless the host or whomever resides in the room has given permission to go in there.  Out of courtesy, I will always knock on closed doors before entering.  Your aunt is rude.  Whatever your reasons to keep certain rooms off-limits to your party guests are yours.  As a guest, I don't get to decide if your reasons are warranted or not.  Your house, your rules, your boundaries.", "Your aunt needs to think up better lies! Why would her new bf need or want to see your walk-in closet. Seeing someone's walk-in closet doesn't usually make the top 10 highlights of a dinner party!  Also, IF that was the reason they invaded your private space, what were they doing in your en-suite and not marvelling over your tour-worthy walk-in closet? Very suspicious, indeed.\n\nI don't know if my parents told me this or I just picked it up, but if a door is closed I don't go in without knocking/ getting permission--but is that the norm?\n\nClosed doors are closed for myriad reasons and knocking and asking permission to open them and enter the room is considered good manners and definitely the norm.\n\n\". . . my aunt privately told me I let the \"stress of hosting\" get to me and embarrased myself and her.\"\n\nNo, she embarrassed herself by intruding into a room that was clearly meant to be off limits. She is trying to shame you to lessen her rudeness.\n\nYour aunt belongs on the naughty list for next year and definitely off your guest list.\n\nNTA, can't say the same about your aunt or her new bf.", "NTA.  A closed door IS a universal sign not to enter that room.  If your aunt wanted to show her bf your closet (wtf for, anyway?), she should have *asked* first.  It doesn\u2019t matter if her place is usually messy.  You didn\u2019t want people seeing YOUR mess, in YOUR home, so YOU are the only one who gets to make that decision.  Being a party guest in someone else\u2019s home doesn\u2019t give you carte blanche to invade their privacy.", "NTA\n\nIf a door is shut in a home it means to stay out of that room. I have never heard of someone casually walking into someone's home and just going into closed rooms...", "NTA. Even if the bedroom had been spotlessly tidy, no guests should enter it unless invited by you. I don\u2019t even allow guests upstairs in my own house and my bedroom is completely off limits to everyone except my children. I think you were very polite and your aunt just doesn\u2019t like being told what to do, it\u2019s her problem.", "Perhaps they had another motive, but that\u2019s the kind of behavior that screams \u201ccasing the joint.\u201d  People keep their medications in their master bath, guns, valuables, sex toys, whatever else is not meant for other house occupants in their closet.  Your aunt and new boyfriend had no legitimate need to be in your room without your consent.  I\u2019d be checking to see if anything was missing.", "NTA. Shut door is a clear sign, so is the Master bedroom being off limits.  It's not up to her to decide what is and is not a big deal to you. State a clear boundary for her, since she doesn't get social norms. She's embarrassed she got called out on bad behavior, she doesn't get to tell you you're embarrassed, stand tall knowing you spoke up for yourself in your own home.", "Probably hoping for \"a quickie\", and almost got caught with their pants down!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP NTA", "Also how would he not be offended by panty hose and dirty laundry if he was somehow uncomfortable with a couch that had some cat hair on it?  The aunt is the AH for sure", "I think you nailed it.", "I agree but maybe not everyone has experience with addicts. I have a relative who I love dearly but if she\u2019s coming over any pain medication gets locked up in my car or left at my neighbors. I swear she could smell the stuff", "You're right that a closed door in someone else's home *should* be a universal sign to knock or get permission before entering and the aunt was indeed in the wrong.\n\nOP didn't get mad or yell or anything, either, so definitely NTA. It sounds like she didn't let her guests know upon entering her home that the bedroom was off limits. I'm not saying that justifies anyone walking in, but just saying that IF she had yelled at them after not making it clear it was off limits, *then* maybe she'd be entering y t a territory. Maaaybe. That's not how it happened though so it's not even close.", "I also thought it was pretty standard not to enter people's  bedrooms unless explicitly invited, regardless if the door is closed. Respecting people's personal space seems pretty basic imo. Op, nta", "You just know \u201cshowing the closet\u201d is an implausible off the charts line of BS.", "Absolutely right.  Highly suspicious at the very least.  This is some serious breach of the very basic boundaries.", "It\u2019s SO rude to go in someone\u2019s bedroom without asking / being invited. Even my friends and family wouldn\u2019t go into me bedroom during a party or event without asking. I know this because I\u2019ve just hosted Christmas and anytime the guest bathroom was in use people would explicitly ask if they could use our en suite!", "NTA\n\nThe door was closed.  That is absolutely the sign for \u201cKeep Out\u201d.\n\nYour aunt is the AH here", "Nope. Nta. A closed door is universal, \u201cdo not enter\u201d and she completely ignored the boundary. Not only did she ignore it, she \u201crationalized\u201d to you why it was OK she broke it, and \u201crationalized\u201d to you why you were the one in the wrong when she realized she was getting called out for her shit. Sidenote, it\u2019s not her closet, it\u2019s not her house, there is absolutely no reason for him to see your closet. That is a stupid fucking bullshit reason. Someone else said it, she was lying to your face.", "NTA and EVERYONE knows you DON'T go in MY room.", "NTA, your aunt is being rude.", "NTA\n\nEff her, you don't go in rooms with doors closed. If she cared about the damn en suite she could have asked first. I don't think they were stealing or, uh, effing or anything but that is incredibly rude. A child knows not to do that and is reprimanded if they do. Don't invite them back.", "NTA. Your aunt was snooping. And possibly planning to make out in your walk-in closet.", "NTA\nShe needs to respect boundaries. It's your home. If you said you don't want someone in there, then she should say \"oh sorry\" and leave the room. Not try to make excuses as to why they are there.", "NTA\n\nA closed door IS a sign that the room is off limits to guests. Going into someone's bedroom without express permission equally if not even more so.\n\nThe fact your Aunt did that & then tried to deflect back at you clearly shows she knew full well she overstepped.", "NTA.", "NTA, your aunt doesn\u2019t get to decide your boundaries based on hers. If she\u2019s cool with a messy house, awesome. You\u2019re not. \n\nAlso, your house your rules. Stay out of my bedroom or leave.", "NTA.", "NTA. And your aunt is full of poop with those excuses. A closed door is clearly a sign that the room is not open to guests.", "NTA. You\u2019re right. If a door is closed in someone\u2019s house, you don\u2019t enter without permisi\u00f3n, and if no one\u2019s in there you ask someone if you can go in. It\u2019s common courtesy. You weren\u2019t out of line to expect that your private space be respected. Even if you have guests, it\u2019s still a private space that no one should be entering without asking you. This is especially the case if it\u2019s a bedroom. Even if the door is open a crack, no one should be entering anyone\u2019s bedroom without permission.", "NTA - a closed door is universal at parties/gatherings as closed off. She only embarrassed herself. Also, check your purse, jewelry, meds, etc to make sure everything is still there.", "NTA, its fucking weird as a guest to take it upon yourself to tour other guests on the most private part of so m eone else\u2019s home, and even weirder to act like you\u2019re the wronged party when the host politely corrects that atrocious behavior.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt doesn't respect you. If she did, she'd have asked permission. She was embarrassed because she got caught out behaving badly. If it was me, I wouldn't ever invite her over again until a sincere apology was forthcoming.", "Paragraphs", "NTA. A closed door is universal code for: \"Always knock & wait for a response.\" The aunt & her bf went in your room to fuck.", "Nta. Don't go into someone's rooms especially when you're a guest in this house. Bringing a near stranger (bf) into your nieces bedroom without permission is disrespectful and maybe it's my trust issues but shady af. He could be a thief", "She wasn't showing him the closet. The way she worded her aside is only said that way to shift blame.\n\nYou now know she is a liar and you need to keep your eye on her. NTA", "Nta.\n\n Your aunt was snooping and got caught.", "NTA. If you\u2019re a guest at someone\u2019s home, stick to the communal areas and indicated bathrooms unless invited into a bedroom.", "I like the way you phrased your question to help OP realize that it's not the mess she is upset about and that she doesn't need a reason to justify why her aunt should not be in her room. \n\nHer aunt was rude and exhibited DARVO tactics to make herself seem like the victim. OP needs a lock on her bedroom door (that is not easy to pick, such as a keypad type) and a hidden safe to keep valuables.\n\nOP is not NTA!", "and she was being entitled......", "NTA. They were extremely rude and inconsiderate. And lying.", "ahahahahaha.....while I suppose it is possible they were casing the joint, (I too, watch a lot of crime shows and I was even a thief as a youth), I think the simplest explanation might be they were having sex or the aunt really did want to show her bf the closet/room, both reasons of which show she is entitled and the asshole. \n\n  \nbut maybe it's just me who's first thought was sex...", "Or jewelry.", "Oh, drug seeking isn't a bad guess, it didn't even occur to me", "> my aunt privately told me I let the \"stress of hosting\" get to me and embarrased myself and her\n\nYup, pointing out that op was stressed.

But then again common sense is not so common. Next year I would have a lock put on the door to keep nosey busy bodies out or hand a DO NOT ENTER sign.\n\nRidiculous!", "I would message some version of that section of your post to the aunt if I was OP. \n\nA politely worded version of \"my walk in closet isn't in the damn bathroom\" and see what lie comes next", "Maybe you\u2019re right but the use of the words \u201chad to sit\u201d kind of sounds like she was saying it was uncomfortable.
