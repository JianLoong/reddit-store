He and I have never had the best relationship, which only worsened when he and my mom divorced when I was 10 and again when my mom died a couple of years later. He had remarried in the time and had a child who was just born before I moved in with him. Things were tense between us and even worse between me and his wife. She had an issue with being called by her first name by \"any kid\" but especially \"a child who is now mine\". I refused to call her mom or any kind of mom titled. So from there out she was Mrs Last Name. She was agitated by that and told me it was setting a negative example for my half brother. I told her I did not care and I was not there to set an example for her child. She told me it was my duty as an older sister. I told her no. And told her she would not win against me. She also took offense to my having photos of my mom in her home, even though they were all in my room. So I had to hand them over to my maternal aunt and uncle before she tossed them in the trash.\n\nDad and I fought over the issue too. He told me she had been excited to take on the role of my mom and I asked him if she'd been hoping my mom would die then, if both of them had. He told me there was nothing wrong with taking a negative and turning it into a positive.\n\nI moved out of his house when I was just turned 17 after begging my aunt and uncle (her husband) to fight for custody of me. Things were so toxic it was agreed in court that it was the best choice for me.\n\nI graduated high school in May and my friends and I planned a road trip. We were going to take in some sights, do some shopping and enjoy being done with high school (our high school experience was pretty shitty thanks to bullying). A couple of days before we were ready to go dad calls and says his wife's mom had fallen seriously ill and that I needed to take care of their kids so he could be with her, because the kids would not be allowed in the hospital and were too young for the stress of it all. I told him I was not helping out and he needs to pretend I don't exist because I will never help him. He threatened to not pay for my college (he was never going to which I called him out on). He said he would take the money my mom left me and I told him he could not. He told his wife and she called to curse me out and say what a nasty little shit I was. She told me I should be helping my siblings, my whole family. I told her they were no family of mine and she and my dad needed to figure something else out.\n\nThey have both since left several texts that I'm a huge ass and that I made the death of her mother so much worse on the whole family with my selfishness.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688244649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o5ccc/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_with_friends_instead_of/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
