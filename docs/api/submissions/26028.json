My girlfriend (24F) has basically been my chauffeur, taking me where I need to go, picking me up from work, giving me rides to places, etc. I always reimburse her in gas as I used to take Ubers everywhere and her help has saved me lots of money in that regard. \n\nProblem is, my girlfriend has really bad road rage. Like, awful road rage to the point where I am scared to be in the same car as her most of the time. She tailgates, flips other drivers off, passes people on roads clearly not meant for passing, screams and curses at the top of her lungs, gets so frustrated that she hits the steering wheel, etc. Not to mention she feels like the speed limit in our area is a joke and speeds like a madman. We have never been in an accident but we have had near misses that are way too close for my comfort. This is nearly everytime she drives. \n\nAfter one of these incidents, I told her I would not be riding with her anymore. She scoffed at this and told me to grow up, but I let her know I was dead serious. I had the following day off, but we had a date planned with a group of friends , to which I let her know I would be finding other arrangements to meet her there instead of riding together. I guess she thought I was joking because she showed up outside of my house to pick me up and I refused to get into the car with her. I showed her that I had an Uber on the way and that I will be glad to meet her there. We argued back and forth, she told me to \u201cget in the goddamn car\u201d but I stood my ground and waited for the uber instead. She sped off angrily.\n\nShe barely spoke to me on the date, and all around had a bad attitude the entire night. After the date was over and we were headed outside to leave, I told her my uber was on the way and she exploded on me, saying how embarrassing it was that she had to show up by herself and wait for me instead of arriving together, making it seem like were were having issues. And now everyone will see we are leaving separately as well. I just told her until she fixes her abnormal road rage this is how it had to be and she again, got into her car and sped off angrily. She has been giving me the silent treatment since. \n\nMy intention wasn\u2019t to embarrass her, but I\u2019m genuinely scared for my safety (and hers) everytime she drives.

Her luck is going to run out if she keeps it up.", "I guess you make a good point, although from what I\u2019ve seen her rage literally stems from driving.

Maybe she\u2019s running late and all these people make her later. She thinks rules don\u2019t apply to her. This is how her family drove so she doesn\u2019t know better. She doesn\u2019t like driving, so is it she lacks confidence and is actually scared of driving and this is how she handles being scared?  She has other outlets for her anger at home or away from the car, but can\u2019t do those things in a car. \n\nMy biggest question is what will happen when she has an accident. Because you know it\u2019s not if, it\u2019s when. Chances are she will blame the other drivers and not take responsibility because you basically just said she doesn\u2019t have a clear answer as to why she drives like this, as she thinks everyone should drive like this. Meaning she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s the problem. So will she blow up on whoever she hits?  What happens if she hits a pedestrian? \n\nYour NTA for finding other rides.", "If everybody drove like her I think there would be a lot more accidents in your area\u2026", "Oh boy.

Her way of driving is what usually sets me off.\n\nIt might be stemming from a fear of driving, I used to speed because I just wanted to be off the road. Meds help. Breathing exercises help, having a mindset of \"that person is speeding because they're trying to get to the hospital\" sometimes helped. Using cruise control is great to stop me from speeding. \n\nIf she doesn't see this as a wakeup call to her dangerous driving and tries to blame you, run. Hopefully she can see just how bad it is before someone gets hurt.", "Info: are you in America?
