That sounds like a very innocent and straightforward question, appropriate for all ages. Plus, I've heard lots of girls ask this very same question when someone announced their new engagement.\n\nSince she got so touchy and walked away, something has to be up. Like, she gave him an ultimatum to shit or get off the pot, or maybe she proposed to him, and she's embarrassed about that.  Or maybe she found the ring in his sock drawer or jacket pocket, and he caught her in the act, so she put it on and then jumped in his arms, but the ring wasn't meant for her. Perhaps the guy had a big elaborate proposal setup that went horribly wrong. Maybe she made up the guy and bought/stole/found the ring herself. \n\nThere has to be an explanation as to why she had that reaction to such an innocuous question...", "NTA, that's a very simple yes or no question to answer.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't have mentioned her engagement if she wasn't willing to answer the inevitable follow up questions. Your question was absolutely harmless and a very normal follow-up question. \n\nI suspect that you hit a nerve unintentionally - maybe something along the lines of the proposal came about because she issued an ultimatum. Just my guess, of course.\n\nI don't think you need to apologize or say anything else to her about it.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the ah for asking but now you know her boundaries so I\u2019d steer clear of questions like that from here on out. NTA.\n\nEdit: I want to make sure that it\u2019s clear I mean you should steer clear of asking *her* questions like that. Your question was perfectly harmless and I think most people would not be that weird about it.", "Very straightforward, NTA. \n\nSeems like she is having some underlying issue that you would have had no way of knowing about. You didn\u2019t say anything wrong.", "NTA \n\nSome bug crawled up her arse but it wasn't you. I'd be polite but cool to her from now on, if I were you.\n\nShe could have easily said \"Oh, I don't want to get into that rt now, sorry\" but chose not to.", "NTA. That\u2019s a common question.", "NTA You said nothing inappropriate. Many times it's a story brides to be like to share exhaustively. Next time you speak with her let her know you didn't mean to encroach on her privacy you were just happy for her.", "NTA.  Considering she brought up the proposal to begin with, I don't know how anyone would assume that topic would be private.", "Very much NTA. That\u2019s a normal question and if it\u2019s something she wants to keep between just them, she didn\u2019t need to be snippy about it. I think most people love to tell the story of their engagement (same with prom-posals). I usually ask (if someone else doesn\u2019t ask first!) and some people are shy about it so the exchange lasts a few seconds, but most are happy to share.", "NTA, that's really bizarre behavior from her.", "The day my husband proposed coincidentally happened to be the day I got the official offer for my current job (AND my birthday). When I spoke with the recruiter I was so excited I started crying and told her why it was basically the best day of my life\u2026fast forward to a month later when I started my job nearly everyone in the company knew the story because it was unique. I had probably 20 total strangers ask about my engagement within my first couple days there. \n\nPeople ask about these things because they\u2019re excited for you. If she didn\u2019t want to answer questions she shouldn\u2019t have announced an engagement. Avoid her and know you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.   It might be good to document this conversation via email to yourself and the other people in case she is going to bring it up to anyone that can make your life difficult.", "NTA.  Seems like an innocuous question to me.  For the sake of workplace peace, you might want to apologize for offending her and say you didn\u2019t mean anything by it, but given her unpredictability, that could also backfire.", "NTA yeah that was a strange reaction", "Easiest NTA on here by far. That was an innocent and normal question to ask. It makes no sense to tell people about her engagement if she doesn't want people to take an interest in it. I would advise you inform HR of this interaction, not to get her into trouble but to get some support in case she tries to report you for something you haven't done- basically, pre-empt anything.", "NTA\n\nEven if she didn\u2019t want to share, she didn\u2019t need to be so weird about it. If she\u2019s willing to bring up the engagement, people are going to ask. She could have lightly said \u201coh, that\u2019s a private story\u201d and laughed it off instead of being an AH about it.", "NAH. I don't think she responded the best way, but it's up to her if she thinks it's private.\n\nDon't worry about it and move along unless someone brings it up again", "NAH. You weren't being inappropriate.\n\nHer response could have been less cold, but if the proposal was private to her, leave it be. I'm not going to judge her just by her tone without knowing what prompted it.", "NAH. Just refrain from talking about weddings with this person, apparently.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sure what her deal was.", "NTA that\u2019s a general follow up conversation when someone announces an engagement.", "NTA. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong that\u2019s a really odd reaction she brought up she just got engaged perfectly normal people would ask questions about it!", "NTA\nIt\u2019s a completely normal question to ask when someone announces their engagement. Together with when are they planning to get married. Big/small affair. Omg show the ring! \nYou\u2019re fine. She\u2019s weird. Ignore and move on", "NTA, recently-engaged woman here, and I will happily gush to any of my colleagues who ask about any and every aspect of the proposal, wedding plans, my fianc\u00e9 in general...\n\nHer reaction to your question was definitely weird.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know why that was triggering to her, as that question is not improper in any way. I would just keep my distance from her if you can.", "NTA. That\u2019s such a cagey answer I wonder if she pressured him to propose.", "NTA. She got the ring but not the proposal she wanted. That question is completely normal to ask!", "NTA - why bring it up publicly, if it\u2019s private. She\u2019s being odd.", "NTA, she brought up that she got engaged. Its very weird that she got cagey about your question when most people would ask about how the proposal happened. Why did she bother bringing up she got engaged if she didn\u2018t want to talk about it. Getting engaged is really a great conversation starter and is no way a conversation ender if that makes sense.", "NTA- what an odd reaction to your question.  Why bring it up and get weird when people want the deets. Im a private person very very private but if I'm showing something off I wanna talk about all of it. But maybe that's just me and my experience with other people.", "NTA\n\nYou asked a very common and very normal question, so I'm not sure why she reacted that way.\n\nPlus, she was the one who brought up the fact that her boyfriend proposed to her. It wasn't like you were the one who first brought it up.", "NTA.  A former coworker of mine got engaged and I asked him how he proposed.  It turns out his gf proposed (also a former coworker) and it was a really cute story.  I would've backed off or not asked if it was a weird question but it's just a standard question.  \n\nShe could've just said that she didn't feel comfortable answering that in a polite manner and left it at that.", "NTA, I knew a guy who proposed when his girlfriend said, \u201ceither you marry me or I\u2019m leaving!\u201d Least romantic proposal story ever, and then they divorced after about 18 months. \n\nI\u2019m betting her story is similar.", "Right.  I strongly suspect her reaction was not about you but something else entirely.", "Just don\u2019t talk to her at all aside from work.  Sounds like someone who takes very harmless innocent things and makes a huge deal of them.  Protect your career, business only with her.", "Bet the co-worker had been pushing for the engagement for awhile!", "My bet is it was after sex. can't tell grandma or Facebook that story", "NTA. Put on Bayne Gibby singing \u201cI Feel Like This Isn\u2019t About Me\u201d and move on.", "I've had this happen with Europeans, specifically French people. \n\nWas she French?\n\nOtherwise no, I don't see why that would be anything other than making conversation. NTA", "Yeah there\u2019s something wrong with this \u201cengagement\u201d announcement.. maybe false,but you didn\u2019t nothing to get her all weird about it.. NTA", "NTA, that's a perfectly harmless and natural question after am engagement is announced.", "NTA. Sounds like there's trouble in paradise.", "NTA\n\nIt's a normal question. I assume she reacted badly because it's not a story she wants to share for whatever reason (maybe it wasn't a very mutual engagement, maybe it was a bad/annoying proposal, etc.)", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s on her not you", "NTA that is such a weird reaction. After I got engaged and was telling people \"how did he do it?\" Was the immediate followup question. I always ask people that as well. \n\nFor whatever reason she's touchy about it though so I'd just leave her be.", "NTA Did he propose because she\u2019s pregnant or something? That\u2019s the only thing that kinda makes the response make sense", "NTA\n\nit makes me think she forced him to propose and didn\u2019t want to lie but also didn\u2019t want to fully say that she forced him (in some capacity) to propose.", "NTA, but most likely there\u2019s a background there and you hit a nerve you didn\u2019t know about. Let it go, I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with you. I will say, I think it IS a bit personal after knowing someone less than 4 months to be, effectively, asking about if they had an in-depth conversation about marriage or if it was a surprise. I can understand how that might strike a nerve with some people. I\u2019m sure you meant it pretty innocently though, so you\u2019re not really an AH for that. I say NTA since if she does have a nerve to strike, probably shouldn\u2019t be sharing things at work but, to each their own.", "NTA. Recently engaged, here. Your question was basically a standard one that gets asked a dozen times when you start talking about being recently engaged. Like, it's a question I would answer for a complete stranger sitting next to me on an airplane making small talk. It's one thing if she wasn't talking about her engagement and you brought it up out of the blue [even then, it wouldn't necessarily have been weird or inappropriate]. But \"oh, cool, were you surprised?!\" in the midst of her already talking about it? Totally normal. She's being weird.", "NTA as a woman who is engaged, this is actually a frequently asked question.\nIt\u2019s a nice thing to ask when you don\u2019t want to brush someone off with a simple \u201ccongratulations\u201d and to actually show interest in their experience and that you care. \nI\u2019m guessing something might be up since she got so defensive and I wouldn\u2019t pry, just let it be.", "NTA. That's a totally normal question to ask, her reaction was not predictable. I wouldn't dwell on it too much.", "NTA. Hers was a very odd reaction.", "NTA. Sounds like she has an issue there for some reason. \n\nWhy do i want to think it was a long relationship that she has to goad into a marriage.", "Yeah, they were all *in* conversation, it's not like OP slid over out of nowhere and asked that question; it's like if the coworker had mentioned she ate cake the day before and OP asked what type and she got angry about it. If it's a touchy subject... Why even bring it up?", "Maybe she proposed to him", "I feel like that was basically the most asked question when we announced our engagement\u2026 \u201chow did he do it? Were you surprised or did you know he was gonna ask?\u201d Etc etc, there\u2019s definitely something else going on here", "I\u2019m guessing the way he proposed was somewhat underwhelming and she\u2019s embarrassed she didn\u2019t get a big romantic story to share", "Exactly. The boundaries are clear and small talk is off limits with her."]}
