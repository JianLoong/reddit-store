{"id": 13032, "submission_id": "11zwztl", "title": "AITA for wanting to have an opinion on my sister's wedding dress since I'm the one paying for it?", "selftext": "My (f25) sister (f27) is getting married. We don't come from a wealthy family, her fiance and his family are also not wealthy so neither our parents or his are gonna help around in paying the wedding. I got married three years ago, my husband is wealthy enough, so we decided to offer our help to pay their wedding. We will paying for the venue, catering and the bride/ bridesmaids dresses. That's only what we agreed to but we are happy to pay for more stuff in case the money is needed, we don't really have problems with money and it makes us happy to help them celebrate their wedding. \n\nI don't have a job and I love to plan social events (especially weddings) so I offered my help to my sister, she's very happy with my help. Up until now we have had no discussions and my sister, FBIL and I have been on the same page for almost everything. \n\nHowever, it's about time she buys her dress and picks the bridesmaids dresses. So I went over to her apartment and I suggested we could go shopping on the weekend (since she doesn't work), we could take our mom, her FMIL and maybe someone else if she wants to. My sister was taken aback by this request and said that she planned to go alone because she didn't wanted to feel pressured to pick a dress she doesn't like. She said that it has happened with some other stuff and doesn't want it to happen with the dress too. \n\nI told her that that's not fun at all, dress shopping is a nice activity to do together, I am also her MOH and I want to help her pick her dress. She told me I will bully her to buy a dress I like and not one she actually likes and wants to use on her special day. We argued about this for a bit more, the more we spoke the worse I felt because this is supposed to be a bonding activity, I invited to go buy my dress when I got married, why can't she do the same? Then I told her that I felt like her ATM because she only wants my money but doesn't want to include me. She told me I offered to help them pay for the wedding, they didn't asked, and that I was an asshole for trying to gaslight her into doing what I want. \n\nThen I left. My husband agrees that if my sister can't do something as small as letting me go with her to buy her dress, then I should tell her I will not help paying for it. However, my sister cried to our parents and my mom called me to tell me off because it looks like I'm using my husband's money to get my sister to do anything I want in her day.\n\n\nEdit: for fucks sake, I said that my sister's doesn't work on weekends, she does work on weekdays. And why would I even judge her if she wouldn't have a job if I don't have one either?", "created_utc": 1679604752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zwztl/aita_for_wanting_to_have_an_opinion_on_my_sisters/", "score": 1103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn't about you wanting to bond this is about you wanting to have some control over your sister. Of this was really about \"bonding\" you would have said: \n\nI'm sorry you feel I would try to take over your day but I promise I won't. You can get any dress you want I just want to be there with you.  \n\nBut no you won't say thay because you want to choose her dress for her", "YTA\n\nYou're using your money as leverage for control.

Gifts with hidden strings are the worst. Not surprised she wanted to do this solo... you probably would override her choices.\n\nETA: also, you both grew up without money and now you're dangling money over her head to force her to do what you want? Classy.", "YTA. \nIf you were going to attach strings to your gift, then you should\u2019ve been upfront about that from the beginning.", "It sounds from the way you tell it that you may have a really strong personality and your sister not so much.  So she feels obligated to do things the way you want, not the way she wants.  So, yes, I can really see her feeling the need to put her foot down on this one thing.  \n\nThis is also why mixing money with family is problematic.   It would have been better, if you wanted to help financially, to have offered a set amount of funds to be used towards the wedding or as a wedding present and then let her use them as she and her fianc\u00e9 determined to be best for them while letting her know that IF she wanted your opinion/help with planning, then she could ask, otherwise you would stay out of it.  \n\nFrankly, I'd have turned down your offer and had a wedding I could afford.  Much less drama that way!", "Yta... it's her wedding. it's about her and what she wants. Not you. I repeat NOT YOU! you offered the money and now want to take it back because she wants to do something on her own? your sister is right about everything she said about you. \nyou aren't supposed to help her pick out a dress even if you were invited to go. your job would be to sit there, shut up, until the time it's to tell her she looks beautiful. let her pick it out solely without any of your input", "YTA\n\nDress shopping is a nice activity to do together when everyone in the party wants to do it together. What you're proposing is using money to manipulate your sister into something she has no interest in doing with you. Reading your post, I 100% understand why she's concerned about you pressuring her into a dress she doesn't like. Why? Because you're already using the \"it's my money\" thing to try to manipulate her behavior.\n\nApologize to your sister for offering what appeared to be a gift, but was actually meant as a down payment for some kind of forced \"bonding\" session.", "YTA and so is your husband. It\u2019s her wedding, not yours. If you\u2019re going to add conditions to your \u201cgift\u201d, then keep it.\n\nSister and mom are right: you ARE a bully and trying to get your way in what is supposed to HER day.

Did it come with restrictions such as the wedding should be planned according to your wishes?

The rest is up to her. This is why people don't like accepting money from others. You're saying you want to be nice, but you actually feel like you're entitled to some ownership over her experience.", "YTA, yes you've offered to pay but it sounds like your gift comes with strings attached, so not really a gift at all. The fact you mentioned your sister said you would 'bully her' into buying a dress, makes me think you have done this before. If you really want to help your sister, let her plan the wedding she and her partner wants, not the one you think you should have input into.\nEdited to add, if going with her to buy her dress is such a \"small\" thing, why are you make a big deal of it?", "YTA. It's kind of a gift, and you don't put what you want in your gift, you put what the person receiving the gift wants.", "You realize this isn't your wedding,  right? Finacial contribution or not, the bride and groom get the final decision on anything wedding related.  YTA", "YTA. You want to be in control of her wedding.

She can choose whatever dress she wants, she could wear a suit for fuck's sake and I'll still gladly pay if I were you.

So because your sister accepted the help, which she never asked for, you feel entitled to tell her how she is supposed to shop for a dress and get a vote. Don't offer to help anyone if you have conditions that must be met. You are a total asshole and a shitty sister.", "Hard YTA. She\u2019s clearly been pressured by you to take on things for the wedding she doesn\u2019t like and she\u2019s finally putting her foot down for the outfit she\u2019s wearing. You\u2019re being a bully.", "Sorry but YTA here\n\nSome people don't find the same things fun, you might've had a great time shopping for your dress like that but it's not everyone's cup of tea and if she wants to go alone that's up to her.\n\nYes you are helping her by paying for stuff but it doesn't mean you get to dictate a thing. A true gift doesn't have strings attached.", "YTA, she doesn't feel like she can stand up to your \"bullying\". She said she wanted to pick it out by herself. It's her day and her dress. You've helped/bonded so much already why not let her do this on her own. Also, if you offered to help pay then it's a dick move to say I'm not going to pay if I can't be involved in every aspect of your wedding. To me comes off as spoiled and elitist.", "YTA isn\u2019t the expectation that daddy keeps his nose out of the wedding planning and just writes the check? Why can\u2019t you do the same?", "Yta. Respect her request. Its her wedding.  You got.mad because she wasn't doing what you wanted.", "YTA is not your wedding, it's hers. Just because you said you'd pay for the dress and other wedding purchases doesn't mean you have any say if what she buys. Sounds like you're already married, so you've already had the chance to make those decisions. Let her plan her own wedding. She expressed that she's already felt bullied into purchasing stuff she doesn't really want, and she doesn't want dress shopping to be the same way. That tells me she isn't enjoying what is supposed to be a joyful time. Let her pick out her dress on her own. She doesn't want it to be a bonding experience. She wants it to be a fun experience, and she must not think it will be if others go.  \n\nIf that makes you mad then tell her that you're not going to make any more purchases for her. You shouldn't have offered to buy anything if you were going to try to get upset by her choices.", "YTA\n\nGenerally people aren't worried about other people pressuring them to do or buy something they don't like if it hasn't happened before. If you think her concern is unfounded, ask for examples of when you've pressured her into something before. It's her wedding, and based on what she said to you, she wouldn't have invited you to go dress shopping even if you weren't paying for it. You can bond at a bridal shower or Bachelorette party. Let her choose her own dress.", "YTA are you even listening to her or are you continue being a bulldozer\u2026 she told you she has already felt pressured into certain decisions and she fears the same with her dress, instead of apologising and reassuring her you continue bulldozering\n\nAn opinion when ASKED is fine, but you do NOT get a say on what dress she buys aslong as she stays within the agreed budget\n\nThis could be a great bonding experience, but not when you act all bossy cuz you pay\n\nA gift is a gift, if you only wanted to pay if you got a final say you should have told her that before making the promise to pay\n\nYou are taking the fun away from your sister planning HER wedding, dial it down apologise for overstepping/bossy and maybe she is willing to give it a retry, that means she gets to decide who comes dress shopping with her, you already gave your opinion on that she doesnt need to hear it again, prove to her she (and her partner) is in control of how she does her wedding\n\nNo pushing towards certain decisions etc\n\nETA: your mother is right, your husband is wrong", "YTA. You offered to pay and the only input you have is the amount you're willing to budget for it and **that's all**. You ARE gaslighting her and being rude. Just because you invited people to go dress shopping with you does not mean you are owed the same courtesy.", "YTA - You might be paying and that's fucking AMAZING to be doing that BUT it's still HER wedding and you shouldn't automatically get dibs in everything she does and how she does it. If you can't cope with that you shouldn't be paying.", "YTA completely and utterly. Your sister told you in the nicest way possible that you are bullying her into doing things the way you want them to be done. You ignored her, and tried to bully her into dress shopping the way you thought it should be done. If you weren\u2019t such a control freak she might like spending time with you.\n\nThis is not your wedding. Either you help financially from a place of love, or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t get to control your sisters wedding.", "YTA - You can't blackmail your sister into going with her just because you're paying for the wedding. If this is something she wants to do alone then let her do it. Instead, you should be asking YOURSELF why she'd want to go alone in the first place and ask if there's anything you've done that prompted that choice on her part.\n\nYou offered to pay for the wedding unconditionally. Stop now before you ruin your relationship with your sister.", "YTA\n\nSo, let's get this straight: because your husband is paying (him, not you, you leech), you feel entitled to impose yourself in activities she has good reason to do alone?\n\nIt's clearly not fun for her to buy dresses with you, and no matter how much care you put in wrapping your post with the \"right\" words, we all can see why.\n\nYou don't make favors with strings attached. And your parents are right. You're using your husband's money to get your sister to do anything you want in her day.", "YTA- Offering to buy the dress is a kind gift. Gifts aren't supposed to come with conditions. And its gross you're dismissing her fears about being pressured. Sooooo many brides regret their dress and feel terrible on their wedding say because they got pressured. You're being rude and controlling. If you want to help pay for the dress do so because you love your sister and want to help. Expecting anything in return is a huge AH move. You may think dress shopping is fun, but for many of us its a complete nightmare. I literally ordered a dress off Amazon to avoid it and its the perfect dress.", "YTA. What you liked for your wedding and what you want for hers are both immaterial. If you\u2019re truly considering taking back money you promised for the event, then you are waaaay too into this event for your own wants and not nearly enough for your sister.\n\nYou are acting so petty.", "> She told me I will bully her to buy a dress I like and not one she actually likes and wants \n\nKind of like you were pressuring her into letting you go with her? There's a reason she thinks you will also pressure her into picking a dress that *you* like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My husband agrees that if my sister can't do something as small as letting me go with her to buy her dress, then I should tell her I will not help paying for it.\n\nYTA, both of you.", "Yta. It is not a bonding activity if you are pressuring her to do something she doesn't. This is not a hard concept. Is there anything else you are purposely ignoring?", "YTA\n\nyou offered, she didn\u2019t ask. If your money comes with all the strings, I can see why she\u2019d be upset. This is HER day, not yours.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your wedding. Your opinions on any dress she may want are irrelevant. Either the money is a gift (no strings) or it isn't.", "YTA, here's hoping she does use you as an ATM and goes NC afterwards!", "YTA. When bullying failed, you became manipulative and threatening. You should have made it clear up front that you expected to stage-manage her wedding. If you love her you'll honour your original offer and give it freely.", "YTA. Not everyone sees wedding dress shopping as a fun or group activity. It\u2019s quite generous that you\u2019re paying, but this still isn\u2019t about you.", "YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re trying to blackmail your sister into sacrificing what she wants so you can have the second wedding of your dreams. Also getting veto power/my way or the highway vibes. It\u2019s HER wedding and she should be able to have what she wants without you there to pressure her into a certain thing or try to veto her choices. You already had a wedding.", "YTA. Paying for a wedding gives you the right to expect input in some of the decisions. \n\nWhat dress the bride wears is not one of them. If you are willing to give her the gift, give it without strings attached. As long as it\u2019s under budget, she should have the freedom to pick what she wants.", "YTA.  Sister was worried that you'd bully her into buying a dress she doesn't like.  Then you tried to bully her into taking you along anyway!  I mean...  how clear do the signs have to be?\n\nLook...  from the story as you tell it, you've been involved in all sorts of other aspects of the wedding, doing sister a solid, all good.  Let her fly solo on this dress thing, it's only one of a thousand decisions.  Be satisfied with having input on 999 of them.\n\nPlease do apologize to sister.  And remember this part: \n\n>  it makes us happy to help them celebrate their wedding \n\nDon't forget that you're trying to make your sister happy.  Don't spend more time making her unhappy.", "YTA and being a 'zilla' at that!\n\nThis is NOT your wedding.  The only input you should have about your sister's wedding dress is how much you are willing to pay for it.  Beyond that, it is not any of your business.  If she chooses to go alone, that is her prerogative.  You may WANT her to include you, your mom, bridesmaids, and others but it is NOT a requirement.  Bullying her into doing wedding activities to your desires is not a good look.  Your mom is correct.  You are trying to manipulate your sister.  \n\nAnd the wedding preparation activities are not to entertain you and make sure you have fun.  And what you did and who you invited to wedding preparation activities has absolutely NO bearing on your sister's wedding prep activities.", "Oh, FFS. When will people learn what \u201cgaslighting\u201d really is.\n\nYTA. Also, you have these subtle digs in what you wrote that came off as moral judgments about your sister. Example: \u201cSince she doesn\u2019t work\u2026\u201d What does that have to do with this issue?", "Yes. YATA. \n\nLet your sister make her own choices even if you disagree. She\u2019s grateful for you paying for it, but she never agreed that you have a say on the design. Be supportive and don\u2019t take it personal. She\u2019ll be forever grateful that you let her have the wedding she wanted.", "YTA\nYou offered to help, but apparently this means that you bought your sister's wedding. Obviously you have been quite pushy already which makes your sister feel like she cannot take you along if she wants any say in get own wedding dress.", "YTA. You offered to pay and this is very generous but this doesn\u2019t mean you get to apply conditions and dictate anything about her wedding or the planning of it. Everyone has different ideas, you wanted her dress shopping with you she wants to do it alone. This is her wedding not your 2nd wedding.", "YTA. You\u2019re bullying her to go WITH her to buy the dress, why would anyone believe you wouldn\u2019t also bully her to select a dress that\u2019s more your taste?", "YTA. If your gift comes with conditions, then it\u2019s not a gift.", "YTA.  Clearly, you think everything is going smoothly,  but her words to you say they are not.   You are way too pushy on what you think is a good idea or not and she feels rail roaded.  I do not think this is on purpose!  But it does sound like facts.", "YTA, so let me get this straight you bulldozed her with other choices because you\u2019re entitled to, I mean you are paying after all. Then when she puts her foot down and says no because she\u2019s catching on you try to revoke your money. \n\nYou don\u2019t see the issue here? You are doing exactly what she is saying. You are trying to manipulate her with money. Also it\u2019s not a bonding activity when one of the people going is being forced into it, it will in fact do the opposite.", "YTA. The only thing you get to set is the amount of money you're contributing (and you shouldn't be decreasing it  based on whether she lets you bully her or not).", "YTA sounds like you already getting your way about everything else with the wedding let her pick the dresses. This is her wedding day not your's stop being selfish and let HER pick her own dress. If was nice of you to offer until you took over and started making demands, now you are just controlling.", "YTA. It is totally normal to have a few people or a big group to go wedding dress shopping, but if she doesn\u2019t want to then it seems like there are conditions:\n1. You get to be present for the picking of the dress\n2. You get an opinion on what dress she picks (of course, everyone can hav an opinion, but it seems like you want her to take your opinion into consideration in what she chooses)\nIf these or any stipulations apply and you guys didn\u2019t talk about this and you rescind your offer because she doesn\u2019t agree to these.. then yeah that kinda sucks\n\nI\u2019m assuming you have some sort of budget for the dress. If she let you go with her, would you buy her  **dream dress** if it were at the top of your allotted budget, even if it you hated  it? If not, then it\u2019s not a gift. \n\nThere are so much more things to do with the wedding that you can bond over! I hope you two resolve this before the rift gets bigger", "Its very telling that even in your own rendition of this, as you look to downplay it, you yourself say \u201cI am also her MOH and I want to help her pick her dress\u201d.\n\nShe should get what **she** wants, this is **her** wedding and **her** day, not yours. If she doesn\u2019t want your input, you should respect that. You offered to pay. **I\u2019m quite confident you didn\u2019t come out the gate with \u201cI\u2019ll pay only if I have input\u201d**, and it is rather shitty to inject that now.\n\nIf you are happy to help monetarily, then do so. Attaching strings to it makes YTA.", "YTA \u201cwe can only bond if it\u2019s while I am bullying her into a dress she doesn\u2019t want\u201d ITS NOT ABOUT YOU. No one is coming when I get my dress. It doesn\u2019t matter if YOU think it\u2019s a good thing to do as a group activity. Your feelings are irrelevant about how she chooses to buy her dress. Get over it", "first - you all live lovely lives - big weddings and none of the women working\n\nBelieve it or not - not every female enjoys dress shopping and even fewer enjoy it as a team sport.  YOU might enjoy it and having people OOhhh and Aaaahh but for other people that's uncomfortable.\n\nYou offered to pay for the wedding and now you are lording it over them all\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nMe me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me\n\nThis is your sisters day not a do over of your own wedding. Manipulation at its finest.", "So, you don't work and are more than happy to spend your husband's money. You go even further by forcing yourself into your sister's wedding ideas and you want to have a say in it all. She already said that she was feeling bullied/forced on some things involved in the wedding so far. You just aren't taking a hint that you are the bully in this. This isn't about your sister; this is about you flaunting your husband's wealth and feeling like you are owed everything that you want for your husband's generous contribution to this wedding. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nApparently she already feels bull dozed by you and with good reason. Either paying is a gift or it's not. Gifts should never come with strings", "Yta what the hell.if you want to pay pay but stop using your husband's cash to control your sister", "YTA. A massive one too.\n\nYou offered to pay, without telling her that the money was so you could play at being an event planner.

We don't come from a wealthy family, her fiance and his family are also not wealthy so neither our parents or his are gonna help around in paying the wedding. I got married three years ago, my husband is wealthy enough, so we decided to offer our help to pay their wedding. We will paying for the venue, catering and the bride/ bridesmaids dresses. That's only what we agreed to but we are happy to pay for more stuff in case the money is needed, we don't really have problems with money and it makes us happy to help them celebrate their wedding. \n\nI don't have a job and I love to plan social events (especially weddings) so I offered my help to my sister, she's very happy with my help. Up until now we have had no discussions and my sister, FBIL and I have been on the same page for almost everything. \n\nHowever, it's about time she buys her dress and picks the bridesmaids dresses. So I went over to her apartment and I suggested we could go shopping on the weekend (since she doesn't work), we could take our mom, her FMIL and maybe someone else if she wants to. My sister was taken aback by this request and said that she planned to go alone because she didn't wanted to feel pressured to pick a dress she doesn't like. She said that it has happened with some other stuff and doesn't want it to happen with the dress too. \n\nI told her that that's not fun at all, dress shopping is a nice activity to do together, I am also her MOH and I want to help her pick her dress. She told me I will bully her to buy a dress I like and not one she actually likes and wants to use on her special day. We argued about this for a bit more, the more we spoke the worse I felt because this is supposed to be a bonding activity, I invited to go buy my dress when I got married, why can't she do the same? Then I told her that I felt like her ATM because she only wants my money but doesn't want to include me. She told me I offered to help them pay for the wedding, they didn't asked, and that I was an asshole for trying to gaslight her into doing what I want. \n\nThen I left. My husband agrees that if my sister can't do something as small as letting me go with her to buy her dress, then I should tell her I will not help paying for it. However, my sister cried to our parents and my mom called me to tell me off because it looks like I'm using my husband's money to get my sister to do anything I want in her day.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact that you are so adamant about being there and saying you deserve to have your opinion heard on it tells me she's right.

My take is going to go against most of the \"TA\" comments here.\n\nThe first misconception that went wrong is the offering to pay for the entire/majority of the wedding. Yes you may have offered with the right intention of giving her a wonderful wedding. However, it is also a test for couples who are engaged to see how they handle difficult situation with their limited budget **together**. By offering to pay, you created a situation where there are \"hidden strings\" attached as pointed out by other commenters. If you truly wanted to contribute to her wedding in the form of money, what you could have done is to just send them a set amount of money (with no chance of extra) and left them to settle the planning on their own. \n\nThe second misconception here is from your sister who assumed that taking the money came with no strings attached when she accepted your offer of being her MOH. Assuming here that no budget was set for the wedding, she would have to know that she has to run through with you what she wants to make sure that you and your husband are comfortable with it. Just because you're offering to pay, does not mean she is allowed spend without consideration of your financial situation. \n\nI think what everyone here has to understand is that even if your sister chose not to take your money, it is highly unlikely that she is able to achieve her dream wedding as it seems her own financial situation does not allow her. \n\nMoving forward, I think there are 2 ways that you can move forward from this:\n\n1) Pull out of being her MOH and tell her that you are going to send her and her fianc\u00e9 a set amount of money (no additional money will be given beyond this amount) and leave them to do the planning. She can appoint one of her friends to be the MOH. On the day of the wedding attend as her family and enjoy/celebrate the day. It is not worth spoiling a relationship with your family over this. This is the easiest outcome as this only requires actions on your part.\n\n2) Your sister has to understand that you wanting to give inputs is a responsibility of a MOH. There are times when soon to be brides get overly stressed over the smallest of details till they wont be happy with any options. A MOH is there to give sound advice based on her knowledge of what the bride likes. Also, it is not unreasonable to know the price of the dress that she likes since you are paying for it. However, this is the harder option as this requires your sister to shift her mindset which is tough with the entire wedding planning going on. \n\nI wish you all the best moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: to put it out there before other redditors question me, I'm married and when it was my wedding, we did not take any money from anyone. My wife and I are just your typical person with average jobs, earning an average salary. While COVID kept our wedding small (est 100 pax), we still had a blast and we learnt a lot about each other when planning the wedding together with our limited budget.", "ESH simple fix have her pay for the dress and let her pick it out. Or even let her pay for everything and wash your hands.", "YTA. You don't get to buy an opinion on someone else's wedding.", "ESH. I think it is worth thinking about if your sister is right. Have you been unintentionally pressuring her to get stuff you liked as opposed to what she wants? It sounds like you haven't been on the same page but have bulldozed her in your enthusiasm. OP - you need to decide whether you are happy to pay for a wedding you like or if you are happy to set a budget and just want to be included, even if her selection is not what you would pick. I actually don't think either is wrong, although the second is very generous. But that choice affects how you handle the situation. If you are only willing to pay for choices you approve of, you need to make that clear. If sister doesn't want to compromise her vision, she needs to pay for it herself. I find it ironic the sister is complaining she didn't ask you to pay and then getting mad when you tell her she can pay for it herself. She can't have it both ways. If it is the latter, than OP should apologise and tell sister she did not intend to override her. Ask her what it is she actually wanted and see if those choices can be changed. Commit to not forcing her to buy the dress you prefer. It is reasonable to want to be involved though.

She does this not because she just wants your money, but she really fears that she would not stand her ground if you disagree about the dress.\nMaybe try some compromise: she goes once to see the dresses, then you go with her and she tries only the dresses she is indecisive about.\n\nI probably would go shopping for the wedding dress alone too, my tastes in clothes are very different from my family's, although I love them.", "I really hope your sister elopes so she doesn\u2019t have to put up with your controlling bullshit anymore.", "Esh.....I get you and your husband are paying for this wedding...but you could just give her a bit of leeway and express yourself without being overbearing. Its ok to help her with ideas and all but taking away her experience of finding and choosing the dress she sees herselfnin is not ok. What if this dress is the one she wants to pass on to a future daughter or DIL? let her have that memory and experience of a good time...not one filled with stress and unhappy times. Let her have her moment.", "Write her the check to cover a fair estimated cost of what you said you\u2019d help with. Move on and let her plan her wedding. IF she asks your option or help you can do so then", "NTA.  People read so much into what people write while distressed.  It\u2019s true that it\u2019s your sister\u2019s wedding.  Also true is that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.  It\u2019s very kind of you to offer.  Maybe she needs to have the wedding she and your parents can afford.   I would reconsider spending more money.   I wouldn\u2019t be involved in anymore decisions.", "I think it\u2019s more like a NAH for me, but I agree with this. Do I think OP is being overbearing and may be stepping over boundaries? Yes. I, personally, like to see where my money is going - could that be the case for OP, idk. But I do think it\u2019s odd to neglect the hand that is feeding you (for lack of better term). \n\nIt is absolutely the bride\u2019s right to say what they want in a wedding, no argument whatsoever. However, the sister also can\u2019t act like OP isn\u2019t contributing an extremely large amount for her wedding and be a little (very little) accommodating. Having different opinions can help make decisions, especially with clothes, BUT I think I\u2019d need more info as to what their sibling relationship is like.

It\u2019s all about control.", "You want to HELP HER by FORCING HER to do things YOU WANT TO DO rather than actually listening to what she wants....right, sure you want to \"help\" her.....did she even ask for your help? or much like the sentence you just wrote that has three \"I want\"s in it did you just steamroll in?", "As a wedding gift, I chipped in for my friends\u2019 honeymoon fund. By your logic, does that mean I have the right to be involved in planning their vacation? I certainly don\u2019t think so", "Treat you what way? This is exactly why YTA. She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong", "Then why does your (confrontational) title say something different?\n\nYTA. She doesn't feel comfortable doing this with you.

You can\u2019t honestly see reason in this when your sister has told you herself she doesn\u2019t want you there because you will bully her into getting what you want for her instead.

With a wedding that size, 8 people is a drop in the bucket and it was family, it\u2019s not like the mom wanted to bring  some random friends she\u2019s only known for a few months. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between that situation and wanting to control what is arguably one of the \u201cmain attractions\u201d of any wedding.", "The groom did know them though. They were aunts and uncles that helped raise him.", "Yes, no doubt asshole behavior and the husband feeds into it too.

Sounds real accepting.", "When this happens because your own behavior/attitude - check yourself. It's not op s Event she even shouldn't give an opinion if not asked. YTA op.\n\nI'm getting the impression from your comments that your sister is better off eloping than taking even 1cent of your husband s money.

I still think OP is in the wrong for the dress thing but I think it\u2019s unfair to blame her for that disagreement", "that is totally besides the point. i hope you understand by now that you are being a controlling bully and ruining your own sister's pre-wedding excitement. she is probably deeply conflicted in this situation and will never forget how you have made her feel.   \ni wish for you to understand one day, that true generosity and kindness means not wanting anything in return.   \nyou are not allowed to feel all high and mighty about your hubby paying for the wedding when you are pulling heavy strings to the money given.   \nthe way you are handling this situation and controlling your sister with money is very ugly and shameful.", "That\u2019s happened at weddings I have attended.\n\nWhen my partner & I were involved in planning our wedding, we sent a list of foods and menus available. We asked questions about allergies, vegetarians, vegans, then preferences. With that feed back we made a decision as to what would be on the menu, a decision made with the chef and catering team. We then sent out what options there would be, some people came back with \u201cthat\u2019s not good enough\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s unacceptable \u201c, \u201cwe have changed our minds\u201d. We said \u201ctough. You don\u2019t need to come, if you do not wish to\u201d.  That whole process took months and hundreds of hours, and huge numbers of phone calls and emails.  We even had special vegan wine for the vegans, yet they still complained. These same vegans complained that the favours we were giving them were not vegan. The thing is, they were. I made sure of that.  Those vegans caused more grief than anyone else , and it was purely about how much control they could have over my partner\u2019s and my wedding. It was also stressful.   If I were to get married now, I would say \u201cyou are getting stale bloody bread, with water, and that\u2019s it\u201d.", "She said you were a \u201cbully\u201d \nShe said she was bullied into things you wanted - but she didn\u2019t. \nShe said she wanted this one thing - the dress.\n\nListen - whether or not you intended to railroad  her with your husband\u2019s money - this is the outcome. She told you how you made her feel.\n\nYour mother told you how this looked. \n\nReddit told you you\u2019re the AH. \n\nSo you have your feedback.\n\nIf you really were not an AH and you really truly never meant to make her feel that way, you\u2019d be horrified, ashamed and you\u2019d feel terrible that your own beloved sister felt like she was being bullied by your \u201cgracious\u201d and \u201cgenerous\u201d offer.\n\nYou would have immediately mollified her and respected her boundaries. \n\nI mean, if you really weren\u2019t the AH you are.\n\nYour husband is also an AH btw. \n\nYou guys were really made for each other.\n\nIt\u2019s a litmus test - if this was all a big misunderstanding, and you really did not intend to come across as some bully throwing her weight around on HER SISTER\u2019S BIG DAY with husband\u2019s money - then again, you would have felt terrible for making her feel that way.\n\nYour sister your mom and internet strangers all see this. \n\nYou\u2019ve got a decision to make - you see how you\u2019ve hurt your sister or you keep pounding sand. \n\nBTW - this thread is filled with exactly this scenario - whoever pays for the wedding oversteps their place and wants to control the guest list. \n\nBut you? You actually thought you could dictate what the bride wore??? \n\nEven the worst JustNo MIL wouldn\u2019t dream of that. \n\nThink about that. \n\nYou are way overstepping and you\u2019re doing it bc you think you\u2019ve bought your way into a power position. \n\nAnd not that it would matter / but you\u2019re not even paying for the whole damn thing! Just parts. \n\nAnd you thought you\u2019d dictate what the bride wore based on paying this and that?? \n\nYikes. Talk about letting a little money go to your head.
