He told me something formal but comfortable. Whatever I felt beautiful in, but to also check with his wife. I honestly felt really left out of the wedding where my emotions were at a high & felt leaving it at that was best- so I didn\u2019t reach out to her.\nMy brother had gotten his tux fitted weeks prior and I noticed the wedding party colors were dark beige. Since I had a hard time deciding what to wear/color to purchase I figured I\u2019d match the color as it would go together in wedding pictures. As I knew we would be taking many. \n\nI purchased a cream dress that was flowy a little below the knee, it had beaded detail at the top. I instantly got looks from many guests along with the wedding party that consisted most of her sisters. My sil was short with me the entire day and it was clearly awkward in photos. My brother eventually caught on to sil attitude about it and eventually talked to me about it the next day. He said \u201cI thought you knew better not to wear white on someone else\u2019s wedding day\u201d I told him I was just going off of their wedding party colors which was beige.

You thought you were entitled to have a role on somebody else\u2019s special day and salty when you didn\u2019t get one so you decided to be that girl. You played yourself. You\u2019re always gonna be that girl who wore white in somebody else\u2019s wedding.", "\"the wedding colour was dark beige, so I wore cream\" come on now you know that's not the same colour. You could have got a beige dress and matched.", "Easy YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t buy for one minute that you actually thought this would be okay. \n\nYou felt \u201cleft out\u201d because you thought you were entitled to being in the wedding party, saw the cream colors for the bridesmaids and decided to match because you wanted to make yourself feel included. You couldn\u2019t care less about looking good for pictures.\n\nOn top of that, if people are chastising you for wearing WHITE, I\u2019m assuming you took some creative liberties with the shade of beige you were matching. \n\nNot knowing the rules isn\u2019t an excuse. Everyone knows not to wear white to another person\u2019s wedding. If you somehow didn\u2019t, and you were having as hard a time as you say finding a dress, a quick google search would tell you what\u2019s appropriate. Or maybe checking with the bride, like your brother told you to do. \n\nThis was intentional to make yourself feel better. I\u2019m not sure if it was also an intentional dig at the bride, but it certainly seems that way too.", "YTA and everyone knows not to wear a cream or white dress to a wedding. You were mad about not being in the wedding and decided to get even. I hope they photoshop your dress into a different color in the pictures. Your lucky nobody accidentally spilled red wine down your dress when you entered. That has been a thing lately.", "YTA and somehow everyone knows it but you. Tough lesson to learn\u2026yikes this is bad", "Straight up, YTA. The wedding colors were dark beige\u2026 so you wore cream. Those aren\u2019t the same colors, sister!  You weren\u2019t matching the bridal party, you were punishing your new SIL because your little feelers were hurt that she didn\u2019t ask you to be in the wedding party. Congratulations, you\u2019ve already created a family rift.\n\nAnd for the life of me, I have no understanding of why anyone would want the kind of attention that\u2019s given to a person who dresses in bridal colors, but isn\u2019t the bride, at a wedding. Yes everyone will be looking and whispering- but not in a good way!!!", "...completely did it on purpose...*", "If she's not IN the wedding party she shouldn't  be trying to match them! It implies you're part of the wedding party, which is what I think she was trying to cause this while time"]}
