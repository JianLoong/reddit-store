Our other brother was his best man while I wasn\u2019t asked to be in the wedding party, nor do a task. My mother was obviously the MOG so she had her important place that day also.

He told me something formal but comfortable. Whatever I felt beautiful in, but to also check with his wife. I honestly felt really left out of the wedding where my emotions were at a high & felt leaving it at that was best- so I didn\u2019t reach out to her.\nMy brother had gotten his tux fitted weeks prior and I noticed the wedding party colors were dark beige. Since I had a hard time deciding what to wear/color to purchase I figured I\u2019d match the color as it would go together in wedding pictures. As I knew we would be taking many. \n\nI purchased a cream dress that was flowy a little below the knee, it had beaded detail at the top. I instantly got looks from many guests along with the wedding party that consisted most of her sisters. My sil was short with me the entire day and it was clearly awkward in photos. My brother eventually caught on to sil attitude about it and eventually talked to me about it the next day. He said \u201cI thought you knew better not to wear white on someone else\u2019s wedding day\u201d I told him I was just going off of their wedding party colors which was beige.
