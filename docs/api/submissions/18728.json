We\u2019ve all worked hard to save up enough money to go, and we\u2019re due to leave in about a week. We\u2019ve each invested $3000+ into this trip, and the trip is supposed to last 2 weeks. \n\nMy sister Grace (fake name) is currently in 8th grade. Her middle school graduation was supposed to be in a few days, but because of scheduling errors with the high school football stadium, it was recently pushed to a week after I\u2019m due to leave for Europe. Thus, I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. This really saddened me because I want to be there for my sister\u2019s milestones, but I\u2019ve already invested a lot of money into this trip and it\u2019s too late to back out because we\u2019re already past the refund deadline for most of the expenses. Additionally, I\u2019ve been looking forward to this trip for so long and it\u2019s the last chance I\u2019ll have to spend time with my friends before we all go our separate ways for post-grad jobs. \n\nI explained this situation to my parents and Grace and I thought they\u2019d understand, but they\u2019re all furious at me and want me to cancel my trip. My parents are accusing me of prioritizing my friends over my family and not caring about my sister. They keep saying that if I go to Europe, I\u2019ll \u201ctraumatize\u201d Grace because her big sister won\u2019t be there for her big day. My dad even said that I can always go to Europe later, but my sister will only graduate middle school once. Grace cried over the phone to me and said I obviously don\u2019t love her. I felt absolutely terrible and I kept apologizing over and over, but they wouldn\u2019t hear any of it. I promised to treat Grace to a celebratory dinner when I got back, but they wouldn\u2019t accept that as a compromise. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I don\u2019t want to cancel because $3000 is not a small amount of money for me. If this was Grace\u2019s high school or college graduation I might reconsider, but there will be other graduations besides middle school. I\u2019d also reconsider canceling if I got the date wrong, but the date was switched and I couldn\u2019t have foreseen it. But I\u2019d still like to know if I\u2019m the asshole.\n\nEdit for context: I mentioned this in a comment, but my parents both immigrated from a pretty poor country and both of them had to drop out before 8th grade. So it means a lot to them to see their kids graduate middle school, but I still don\u2019t want to throw away $3000.", "created_utc": 1685640716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xntyb/aita_for_refusing_to_cancel_my_vacation_to_attend/", "score": 1915, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not her *big day*. College graduation maybe, wedding sure. Middle school graduation?

It's something that has evolved over the years.", "NTA your parents are DELUSIONAL. \n\nyou\u2019re right, $3k and 1yr of planning is a lot. 8th grade graduation is a joke, and a lot of people don\u2019t even get one.", "Absolutely NTA and your family's reaction is appalling. It's not like you scheduled your trip on her graduation date on purpose - it was changed after you scheduled your trip. \n\nYour sister cried because your parents are making this a bigger deal than it should be. It's awesome she's graduating middle school and you should celebrate with her- after your trip.\n\nTake your trip and girl HAVE FUN. Life gets busy as you get older. Enjoy the time that you have now!!!", "NTA: Go on your trip and enjoy. Your family seems to be slightly dramatic to me, this is hardly going to traumatise her. I agree, if it was high school or college graduation then it would be a different situation, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s 8th grade, hardly a major milestone. But then again, I\u2019m from the U.K. and we don\u2019t have graduation as often as you do in the US so maybe this is something I don\u2019t understand, and I\u2019m therefore \u201cunqualified\u201d to speak on.", "NTA. 8th grade graduation isn\u2019t real.", "NTA. But your parents are because they're passing their feelings into Grace. They could have explained and comforted her. Instead, they're using her like a battering ram to make you feel guilty.", "OMG.  NTA at all.  What kind of manipulative crap is that?  Your life is supposed to stop because of an 8th grade graduation?  Please.  I bet your parents aren't offering you $3000 to not go are they?  Don't ask them to do it, they just might and you don't want to set that precedent either.\n\nYou don't need your parents to agree with your life choices.  This is your life, not theirs, and they sound like they are trying to exert some control because they know they are losing it as you grow up.

You are still young and have the time to make these memories with your friends.\n\nSure, Europe isn\u2019t going anywhere, but life isn\u2019t going to standstill for you to have the same experience with you friends.", "NTA is this for real? Middle school graduation? That\u2019s a thing?

Not even Grace is the AH, but your parents are. I Bet when you first told Grace she was probably cool with it, but hearing your parents talk this way has influenced her and for that they're AHs. I would say at some point before your trip, take Grace out for a drink or treat and have a real conversation about the trip, how expensive it, how you would loose a lot of money and most importantly, how much you love her and how this trip does not change that.", "NTA, I have 9 siblings and if any / all of them could not make it i would understand. You are not her parents. I would have (as a joke) said that you better bring my back a good gift if you are missing my grad.", "NTA. Listen. Even if your sister were graduating from high school or college, you wouldn't be the AH in this situation. You may a good faith effort to schedule your time so you could be there for her ... it's not your fault that school administration shuffled the dates around. \n\nBut to be honest, and not to disparage your little sister's accomplishments AT ALL, this isn't high school or college. It's 8th grade. Bring her back a nice present from Europe. Spend a night with her eating popcorn and watching the graduation video. And tell your parents to chill the heck out.", "NTA.  But.\n\nTo start, this is an eighth grade graduation.  Important yes, but hardly a major life milestone.  (High school, college, weddings, etc.).  And you did plan to go \u2014 it was the school that changed things, not you.  \n\nIs it the only time she will graduate eighth grade?  Of course.  And there will be only one first day of high school.  And only one first prom.  And\u2026\n\nAnd I think it is your parents who have stirred stuff up and are definitely the AH.  Reach out to your sister.  Explain how you can both care deeply about her and be unable to attend.  Most events are streamed \u2014 watch that even it ends up being at 3 am.", "NTA. You are definitely right when you say this isn't something as significant as a high school or college graduation. Enjoy your trip!", "NTA, im sorry but your family aren't the ones that just blew $3000, which is no short sum of money, especially in this current economy. If they are willing to pay you for at least some of your non refundable expenses I might reconsider.", "NTA. I would understand them if it was a HS or college graduation but middle school graduations are no big deal. In the grand scheme of things she won\u2019t remember.", "NTA. 8th grade? They have a graduation ceremony for this? You can go to her high school graduation and any college graduation you don\u2019t need to be at everything", "NTA. They\u2019re crazy!  Middle school graduation isn\u2019t a real graduation.  It doesn\u2019t really matter.", "NTA. I don't even have words.  The trip was planned first.", "NTA.  Grace is crying because your parents are drama llamas and are planting this shit in her head.  I actually would have laughed in their faces when they said she would be traumatised \ud83e\udd23 how ridiculous \ud83e\udd23\n\nIf it helps I think you are doing grace a favour going, it sounds like she needs someone sane and normal in her life, do not subscribe to their shit", "NTA. I think they're being unreasonable. If cameras are allowed, maybe they could facetime her graduation walk and u could facetime her afterwards. It's a compromise at least.", "Nta - 8th grade PROMOTION, not graduation. You only graduate once in standard education and twice in higher education. You are totally fine missing your little sister\u2019s eighth grade promotion.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't cancel.", "NTA, and this os why I think stuff like middle school graduations are pretty absurd. Its hardly a step up from congratulating someone for having a pulse but is being emphasized as a a vital day.", "Middle school graduation\u2026 BWAHAHAHAHAH! The whole world is laughing at America. What a pointless celebration. \n\nGo on your trip and see an entire continent where such nonsense is practiced. They\u2019ll be on your side. NTA.", "NTA 8th grade graduation isn\u2019t even a real thing, hell, a high school graduation isn\u2019t a big deal. Your family is acting like she just graduated Harvard law. Tell them you\u2019ll cancel the trip if they eat the costs for you AND all your friends", "I still haven't figured out why schools have any graduation before you're legally able to not be in school. Kindergarten? Sixth grade? Eighth grade? Ridiculous!  You've spent a considerable amount of money on this trip and it's not your responsibility to take care of your sister's expectations.\n\nYou are NTA", "Of course you're NTA. And your parents allowing the narrative that you \"obviously\" don't love your little sister is despicable manipulation. They probably fed her that line to use against you and she's young enough to believe it - disgusting thing for parents to do to a child!\n\n\nGo on your trip. Maybe write your sister a letter explaining so she has your words to reflect on, rather than the horrible lies your parents are feeding her.\n\n\nHave fun, don't let this nonsense cast a shadow over your hard earned, long anticipated trip.

That's a lot of guilt over an 8th grade \"graduation\"\n\nGo on the trip.", "\rHey OP, it's a tough situation you're in, but let's break it down. Based on what you've told us, I'm gonna say NTA here.\r  \n\r  \nFirst off, you've been planning this Europe trip with your friends for like a whole year, and you've put in some serious money into it. It's not like you can just back out now that everything's set and done. Plus, this is your last chance to spend quality time with your friends before life gets all post-grad job crazy. That's a legit reason to want to go, and $3000 ain't no joke.\r  \n\r  \nSure, it sucks that your sister's graduation got pushed back, but hey, that was out of your control. It's not like you purposely planned your trip to clash with her big day. And let's be real, we're talking about middle school graduation here, not high school or college. There will be plenty more graduations in the future for her, so it's not like you're missing some once-in-a-lifetime event.\r  \n\r  \nYour parents and sister are understandably upset, but they need to understand where you're coming from too. You're not some heartless sister who doesn't care about her family. You've tried to make it up by promising to take your sister out for a celebratory dinner when you get back, which sounds like a pretty solid compromise to me.\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of the day, it's your decision to make. It's not fair for your parents to guilt-trip you and say you're traumatizing your sister. That's just way over the top. Maybe try talking to them calmly and explaining your side of things. Hopefully, they'll come to see that this trip is important to you and that you still love and care for your sister. Good luck, OP!", "NTA- tell your dad to reimburse your $3000 if he wants you to go so bad .", "NTA. That's a promotion from middle school to high school! Not a graduation! Go enjoy your trip!", "NTA- and I'd tell anyone who gave you any shit at all...

Sorry to burst their bubble, but a middle school graduation is not some life or death milestone event. It\u2019s middle school. Enjoy your trip- you\u2019ve been planning it for a long time and it\u2019s not at all fair to you if you have to cancel it for something like this. You\u2019ll be able to attend her high school and college graduations down the road hopefully, both of which are more important and memorable.", "NTA\n\n1) What's the big deal with completing the 8th grade? She is going from 8th to 9th grade. The fact that she may be going to a different school is no big deal.\n\n2) It's not your fault that her school messed up their schedule and rescheduled into your trip time.\n\nJust curious if your parents would be willing to pay you back the $3000+ dollars you have already spent for this trip.", "NTA. First of, it's middle school, not a big deal. Secondly, you didn't do this on purpose, it was an error that is no one's fault.
