We\u2019ve all worked hard to save up enough money to go, and we\u2019re due to leave in about a week. We\u2019ve each invested $3000+ into this trip, and the trip is supposed to last 2 weeks. \n\nMy sister Grace (fake name) is currently in 8th grade. Her middle school graduation was supposed to be in a few days, but because of scheduling errors with the high school football stadium, it was recently pushed to a week after I\u2019m due to leave for Europe. Thus, I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. This really saddened me because I want to be there for my sister\u2019s milestones, but I\u2019ve already invested a lot of money into this trip and it\u2019s too late to back out because we\u2019re already past the refund deadline for most of the expenses. Additionally, I\u2019ve been looking forward to this trip for so long and it\u2019s the last chance I\u2019ll have to spend time with my friends before we all go our separate ways for post-grad jobs. \n\nI explained this situation to my parents and Grace and I thought they\u2019d understand, but they\u2019re all furious at me and want me to cancel my trip. My parents are accusing me of prioritizing my friends over my family and not caring about my sister. They keep saying that if I go to Europe, I\u2019ll \u201ctraumatize\u201d Grace because her big sister won\u2019t be there for her big day. My dad even said that I can always go to Europe later, but my sister will only graduate middle school once. Grace cried over the phone to me and said I obviously don\u2019t love her. I felt absolutely terrible and I kept apologizing over and over, but they wouldn\u2019t hear any of it. I promised to treat Grace to a celebratory dinner when I got back, but they wouldn\u2019t accept that as a compromise. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I don\u2019t want to cancel because $3000 is not a small amount of money for me. If this was Grace\u2019s high school or college graduation I might reconsider, but there will be other graduations besides middle school. I\u2019d also reconsider canceling if I got the date wrong, but the date was switched and I couldn\u2019t have foreseen it. But I\u2019d still like to know if I\u2019m the asshole.", "created_utc": 1685640716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xntyb/aita_for_refusing_to_cancel_my_vacation_to_attend/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's something that has evolved over the years.", "NTA your parents are DELUSIONAL. \n\nyou\u2019re right, $3k and 1yr of planning is a lot. 8th grade graduation is a joke, and a lot of people don\u2019t even get one.", "Absolutely NTA and your family's reaction is appalling. It's not like you scheduled your trip on her graduation date on purpose - it was changed after you scheduled your trip. \n\nYour sister cried because your parents are making this a bigger deal than it should be. It's awesome she's graduating middle school and you should celebrate with her- after your trip.\n\nTake your trip and girl HAVE FUN. Life gets busy as you get older. Enjoy the time that you have now!!!", "NTA: Go on your trip and enjoy. Your family seems to be slightly dramatic to me, this is hardly going to traumatise her. I agree, if it was high school or college graduation then it would be a different situation, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s 8th grade, hardly a major milestone. But then again, I\u2019m from the U.K. and we don\u2019t have graduation as often as you do in the US so maybe this is something I don\u2019t understand, and I\u2019m therefore \u201cunqualified\u201d to speak on.", "NTA. 8th grade graduation isn\u2019t real.", "NTA. But your parents are because they're passing their feelings into Grace. They could have explained and comforted her. Instead, they're using her like a battering ram to make you feel guilty.", "OMG.  NTA at all.  What kind of manipulative crap is that?  Your life is supposed to stop because of an 8th grade graduation?  Please.  I bet your parents aren't offering you $3000 to not go are they?  Don't ask them to do it, they just might and you don't want to set that precedent either.\n\nYou don't need your parents to agree with your life choices.  This is your life, not theirs, and they sound like they are trying to exert some control because they know they are losing it as you grow up.

You are still young and have the time to make these memories with your friends.\n\nSure, Europe isn\u2019t going anywhere, but life isn\u2019t going to standstill for you to have the same experience with you friends.", "NTA is this for real? Middle school graduation? That\u2019s a thing?

Not even Grace is the AH, but your parents are. I Bet when you first told Grace she was probably cool with it, but hearing your parents talk this way has influenced her and for that they're AHs. I would say at some point before your trip, take Grace out for a drink or treat and have a real conversation about the trip, how expensive it, how you would loose a lot of money and most importantly, how much you love her and how this trip does not change that.", "NTA, I have 9 siblings and if any / all of them could not make it i would understand. You are not her parents. I would have (as a joke) said that you better bring my back a good gift if you are missing my grad.", "NTA. Listen. Even if your sister were graduating from high school or college, you wouldn't be the AH in this situation. You may a good faith effort to schedule your time so you could be there for her ... it's not your fault that school administration shuffled the dates around. \n\nBut to be honest, and not to disparage your little sister's accomplishments AT ALL, this isn't high school or college. It's 8th grade. Bring her back a nice present from Europe. Spend a night with her eating popcorn and watching the graduation video. And tell your parents to chill the heck out.", "NTA.  But.\n\nTo start, this is an eighth grade graduation.  Important yes, but hardly a major life milestone.  (High school, college, weddings, etc.).  And you did plan to go \u2014 it was the school that changed things, not you.  \n\nIs it the only time she will graduate eighth grade?  Of course.  And there will be only one first day of high school.  And only one first prom.  And\u2026\n\nAnd I think it is your parents who have stirred stuff up and are definitely the AH.  Reach out to your sister.  Explain how you can both care deeply about her and be unable to attend.  Most events are streamed \u2014 watch that even it ends up being at 3 am.", "NTA. You are definitely right when you say this isn't something as significant as a high school or college graduation. Enjoy your trip!", "NTA, im sorry but your family aren't the ones that just blew $3000, which is no short sum of money, especially in this current economy. If they are willing to pay you for at least some of your non refundable expenses I might reconsider.", "NTA. I would understand them if it was a HS or college graduation but middle school graduations are no big deal. In the grand scheme of things she won\u2019t remember.", "NTA. 8th grade? They have a graduation ceremony for this? You can go to her high school graduation and any college graduation you don\u2019t need to be at everything", "NTA. They\u2019re crazy!  Middle school graduation isn\u2019t a real graduation.  It doesn\u2019t really matter.", "NTA. I don't even have words.  The trip was planned first.", "NTA.  Grace is crying because your parents are drama llamas and are planting this shit in her head.  I actually would have laughed in their faces when they said she would be traumatised \ud83e\udd23 how ridiculous \ud83e\udd23\n\nIf it helps I think you are doing grace a favour going, it sounds like she needs someone sane and normal in her life, do not subscribe to their shit", "NTA. I think they're being unreasonable. If cameras are allowed, maybe they could facetime her graduation walk and u could facetime her afterwards. It's a compromise at least.", "Nta - 8th grade PROMOTION, not graduation. You only graduate once in standard education and twice in higher education. You are totally fine missing your little sister\u2019s eighth grade promotion.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't cancel.", "NTA, and this os why I think stuff like middle school graduations are pretty absurd. Its hardly a step up from congratulating someone for having a pulse but is being emphasized as a a vital day.", "Middle school graduation\u2026 BWAHAHAHAHAH! The whole world is laughing at America. What a pointless celebration. \n\nGo on your trip and see an entire continent where such nonsense is practiced. They\u2019ll be on your side. NTA.", "NTA 8th grade graduation isn\u2019t even a real thing, hell, a high school graduation isn\u2019t a big deal. Your family is acting like she just graduated Harvard law. Tell them you\u2019ll cancel the trip if they eat the costs for you AND all your friends", "I still haven't figured out why schools have any graduation before you're legally able to not be in school. Kindergarten? Sixth grade? Eighth grade? Ridiculous!  You've spent a considerable amount of money on this trip and it's not your responsibility to take care of your sister's expectations.\n\nYou are NTA", "Of course you're NTA. And your parents allowing the narrative that you \"obviously\" don't love your little sister is despicable manipulation. They probably fed her that line to use against you and she's young enough to believe it - disgusting thing for parents to do to a child!\n\n\nGo on your trip. Maybe write your sister a letter explaining so she has your words to reflect on, rather than the horrible lies your parents are feeding her.\n\n\nHave fun, don't let this nonsense cast a shadow over your hard earned, long anticipated trip.

That's a lot of guilt over an 8th grade \"graduation\"\n\nGo on the trip.", "\rHey OP, it's a tough situation you're in, but let's break it down. Based on what you've told us, I'm gonna say NTA here.\r  \n\r  \nFirst off, you've been planning this Europe trip with your friends for like a whole year, and you've put in some serious money into it. It's not like you can just back out now that everything's set and done. Plus, this is your last chance to spend quality time with your friends before life gets all post-grad job crazy. That's a legit reason to want to go, and $3000 ain't no joke.\r  \n\r  \nSure, it sucks that your sister's graduation got pushed back, but hey, that was out of your control. It's not like you purposely planned your trip to clash with her big day. And let's be real, we're talking about middle school graduation here, not high school or college. There will be plenty more graduations in the future for her, so it's not like you're missing some once-in-a-lifetime event.\r  \n\r  \nYour parents and sister are understandably upset, but they need to understand where you're coming from too. You're not some heartless sister who doesn't care about her family. You've tried to make it up by promising to take your sister out for a celebratory dinner when you get back, which sounds like a pretty solid compromise to me.\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of the day, it's your decision to make. It's not fair for your parents to guilt-trip you and say you're traumatizing your sister. That's just way over the top. Maybe try talking to them calmly and explaining your side of things. Hopefully, they'll come to see that this trip is important to you and that you still love and care for your sister. Good luck, OP!", "NTA- tell your dad to reimburse your $3000 if he wants you to go so bad .", "NTA. That's a promotion from middle school to high school! Not a graduation! Go enjoy your trip!", "NTA- and I'd tell anyone who gave you any shit at all...

Sorry to burst their bubble, but a middle school graduation is not some life or death milestone event. It\u2019s middle school. Enjoy your trip- you\u2019ve been planning it for a long time and it\u2019s not at all fair to you if you have to cancel it for something like this. You\u2019ll be able to attend her high school and college graduations down the road hopefully, both of which are more important and memorable.", "NTA\n\n1) What's the big deal with completing the 8th grade? She is going from 8th to 9th grade. The fact that she may be going to a different school is no big deal.\n\n2) It's not your fault that her school messed up their schedule and rescheduled into your trip time.\n\nJust curious if your parents would be willing to pay you back the $3000+ dollars you have already spent for this trip.", "NTA. First of, it's middle school, not a big deal. Secondly, you didn't do this on purpose, it was an error that is no one's fault.

Promise to get your sister a gift from your trip for her graduation and have fun on your trip!", "NTA. 8th grade isn\u2019t a milestone. I\u2019d note N A H if it were her high school graduation but 8th grade? That\u2019s ridiculous", "Come home and get me. I\u2019ll make water", "Wow. Someone is putting it in Grace\u2019s head that you not attending means you don\u2019t love her. I would not waste $3000 to attend a middle school graduation either. Take Grace out to a nice dinner to celebrate before you leave and then enjoy your trip. NTA", "NTA if they\u2019re disappointed I have some bad news about the rest of their life", "NTA - I guess this means a lot to Grace, but a middle school graduation? I don't even remember if I had one. Graduation in my mind is really meant for the really big milestones: high school, college, graduate school, and the like. I find it shocking that they would want you to give up your dream trip for a middle school graduation. Can you compromise and maybe have them on Skype or something?", "NTA; it\u2019s not even a proper graduation.", "NTA I actually audibly laughed, it\u2019s a middle school graduation vs an awesome trip to Europe to your friends\u2026.", "NTA.  You have prior plans, it's not your fault the school messed up their scheduling.  And sorry to your sister but a middle school graduation is definitely not worth you losing $3000+.  It's not the end of the world you won't be there.  She still has a highschool graduation, a college graduation and maybe a post grad graduation.  Your parents are actually AH's here expecting you to give up something you've planned for over 12mths and would lose that much money on.  Is your sister the favourite?", "NTA.  I hate to sound insensitive, but this is middle school we're talking about.  Yes, it's a milestone, but come on....no one is going off to a prestigious university, joining the military, traveling the world etc after graduating from middle school.  In the grand scheme of things, it's not THAT big of a deal.  Your parents sound incredibly manipulative and it sounds like they are passing that trait on to your sister.  Not to mention, the scheduling issue was completely out of your hands.", "Obviously your sister might be a bit upset but she will be fine. Your parents on the other hand? They are probably the ones telling her you don\u2019t love her because you can\u2019t go to her middle school graduation. NTA, I feel bad for both you and your sister because your parents seem wack", "NTA the dates changed. You\u2019re invested. Grace is ok. And most importantly\u2026. It\u2019s MIDDLE SCHOOL", "NTA\u2026middle school graduations weren\u2019t even a thing about twenty years ago. Congratulations, you\u2019re advancing to the next grade! Still haven\u2019t finished, though. It is absurd to treat moving from middle school to high school like anything other than the social trauma that it is.", "Since when is a middle school graduation such a bug achievement?! Like common they want you to throw away all that money for this?! Nah mate, don't feel bad and enjoy your vacation.\nThey are manipulative AH and the reason your sister reacted so badly is probably your parents words poisoning her opinion.\n\nMaybe make them a deal. You will skip your trip and join them if they pay you the money you've lost. Hopefully that shuts em up", "Preschool and Middleschool graduations go hand-in-hand with participatory trophies. They are minor events in life. Enjoy your trip.", "NTA. Do not cancel for a graduation.", "Only a funeral can get me to cancel an Europe trip I paid so much for. NTA. It\u2019s just a graduation, everyone needs to get over it. Everyone else guilt tripping you is an AH, including Grace. \u201cYes I love you but I love not wasting my 3k more.\u201d", "NTA. Middle school ain't shit anyway. High school and college I might see their point.\n\nI would tell your parents you'll attend if they reimburse you beforehand plus 500 for the lost opportunity, but honestly? A trip to Europe while you're young with your friends? You won't get another opportunity like this and I'd say it's worth more than just money.", "8th grade graduation is only a thing for people who think participation trophies are real. I grew up so much on a Europe trip in college and would never trade that experience, no matter what family event I might have missed. \n\nNTA and enjoy your trip!", "As long as you have this time 4 years down the road blocked off for the real graduation NTA.", "NTA middle school graduation wasn't even a thing when I was in middle school. It's kind of silly to me that people insist every minor accomplishment should require so much attention.", "NTA, but your parents are, for blowing this out of proportion and riling your sister up.\n\nEnjoy your trip. This is really a once in a lifetime experience.  When you and your friends come back,  it's time for 'the really real world' and you might not get another chance to go together.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t cancel the trip for a high school or college graduation, middle school graduations are jokes. Maybe if they pay you back your 3k you could consider it? But how often do you get to go to Europe with your friends? That will be an amazing experience; a lot better than a middle school graduation.", "NTA. I could understand yournsister being upset but I'm flabbergasted that your parents that your parents are behaving this way.", "NTA\n\nYour parents don\u2019t think very highly of Grace, do they?", "NTA\n\nThough maybe consider a compromise of video chatting during it?", "High School would bug me but I'd understand.  They can screw off for middle school.", "NTA - enjoy your trip. All this drama for middle school graduation. Wtf.", "NTA When did middle school graduations become a huge life event? High school graduations  remain large events because for many people it marks the end of their time in education. Even then though graduation ceremonies are really for parents and the student. \n\nThat being said when my younger kid 'graduated' from preschool the school went all out and even got them robes and hats. Parents brought flowers and balloons.  Spouse and I just sat there in mild shock. We thought the \"graduation\" was going to be the kids singing a few cute songs and eating some cookies.   \n\n\nIs this the last graduation ceremony your sister is likely to have or something?", "Lol NTA.. your family is all dramaqueens.. get over it. Go to Europa and have fun", "I read the title and thought high school or college graduation, but 8th grade? Jesus, NTA. Your family needs to get a grip.", "I didn't even want to go to my middle school or high school graduation lol", "Thank you for this . I didn\u2019t want be rude  but was definitely thinking this . I live in the UK and we have graduations for undergrad and masters level / when you  get your phd or something but not middle / high school", "Middle school and high school graduations really aren't things in the UK so I find it wild how much emphasis goes on it in America", "Grace might need therapy next time because \u2018My sister missed my graduation and I never got over it\u2019 \ud83e\udd23", "and pay for his substitute vacation - with his friends", "Ikr I be concerned as to where she learned this behaviour of \u2018if you don\u2019t do this for me you don\u2019t love me\u2019 because that reeks of entitlement.", "As if finishing 8th grade is such an accomplishment. Let's get real.", "I hate how the parents have manipulated the girl into thinking this is a testament to OP's love for her.  What jerks.", "You\u2019re not missing much. There is usually a little \u201cceremony\u201d where the kids walk across a stage and get a piece of paper from the principal and that\u2019s it.\n\nThere is one for elementary school too\u2026 which might be more \u201cimportant\u201d than the middle school one as it\u2019s the first time they are graduating, and I\u2019m sure that OP was at that one.", "Honestly, even if it was H.S. I would say go on the vacation.  Changing the date, even though it's no one's fault, is the problem here.\n\nGraduations from every little thing have become a thing but most sane people don't take them too seriously.  My kids' school kept it low key and called it a \"moving on ceremony\" which was much more rational but not actually necessary.", ">I mean\u2026 it\u2019s middle school.\n\nI actually don't even understand why you would have a graduation from middle school (it's not a thing where I'm from). Has a \"participation award\" vibe to it.", ">If they are willing to pay you for at least some of your non refundable expenses I might reconsider.\n\nNot even then because it's a trip with a group of friends - it can't happen at some later date.", "My school didn't have a middle school graduation. I did not attend my high school graduation. I am not traumatized.", "yeeeeeaaaah, my niece just recently graduated from preschool. \n\nAlas, I was unable to get that day off from work  /s", "Here, not everyone goes from high school to University/College. So high school graduation is really seen as you are now an adult. A finality of one chapter and opening of the next.\n\nAdditionally, until the the mid 40's less than 50% of students completed high school and into the 70's that number was still under 75%. In some families, graduating high school was a huge achievement. It generally meant that your parents were successful enough that you did not have to drop out to help support the family.", "Especially since No Child Left Behind where it felt that everyone passes regardless. Don't get me wrong, I've known kids who've been held back but when I was in highschool (graduated 07) it felt like they would do anything to get the kids to the next grade. Like I barely passed any most of my classes (I was that asshole kid that refused to do homework, paying for it now lol) but other than summer school it was never an issue. Hell I had friends at continuation schools where to graduate they just had to finish worksheets that were well below state standard (example; state math requirements back then to graduate were to have passed geometry and my friend's math work never progressed past pre-algebra.)", "She's definitely taking her lead from them.", "Oh, we\u2019ll if this is the case, come across the pond and enjoy Europe OP before adulthood truly grabs you. You might regret missing this trip more than the graduation in the long term.", "\nMy neighbor put this HUGE sign  in her yard that says \u201cCONGRATS -NAME- ON YOUR GRADUATION! 6th grade here you come!\u201d - it was for a FIFTH GRADE GRADUATION! The kid is going to middle school next year and she\u2019s got a sign that brags about it like he graduated from Harvard. These little graduations are ridiculous and, in my opinion, take away from significant ones like high school and college.\n\nNTA - it\u2019s freaking 8th grade. It\u2019s really not a big deal and definitely not big enough to be the cause of all this drama. Go on your trip, pick her out a nice souvenir, and take her out to lunch and give it to her when you get back. I promise, she\u2019ll be fine,", "Because it is a participation award. Graduating middle school is what you're supposed to do. But for some reason we have a society have decided that the mundane needs to be celebrated.", "lucky. I had to attend a formal dinner thing when \"graduating\" 8th grade (I cannot roll my eyes hard enough) and am still irritated about having to attend my high school graduation. I am traumatized.", "I mean, not everyone in the UK goes on to uni or college, some people go straight into work or to apprenticeships. I do vaguely get high school graduations but middle school?"]}
