Katie did come over last year, and me/our family met her a grand total of once in the entire time she was here.\n\nKatie sadly died in a crash recently. He's flying to London for her funeral, which is happening next week. It would be one thing if it was nearby, or even another state, but this is a whole different country that will take days just for travel there and back. He'll be missing my wedding, which he's a groomsman in.\n\nI told Jack gently, I'm sorry for what he's going through and I understand he's upset, but he's willing to miss his own sister's wedding for this.

It seems like Jack truly loved Katie and saw a future with her, and unfortunately a young life has been taken way too soon. A death of a loved one is very, very hard OP. Take it from someone who's lost her fiance.

He's grieving his girlfriend. Just because YOU only met her once doesn't mean that HE didn't have a very loving and meaningful relationship with her.
