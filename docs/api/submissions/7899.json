He's flying to London for her funeral, which is happening next week. It would be one thing if it was nearby, or even another state, but this is a whole different country that will take days just for travel there and back. He'll be missing my wedding, which he's a groomsman in.\n\nI told Jack gently, I'm sorry for what he's going through and I understand he's upset, but he's willing to miss his own sister's wedding for this.

It seems like Jack truly loved Katie and saw a future with her, and unfortunately a young life has been taken way too soon. A death of a loved one is very, very hard OP. Take it from someone who's lost her fiance.

He's grieving his girlfriend. Just because YOU only met her once doesn't mean that HE didn't have a very loving and meaningful relationship with her.

He's obviously devastated and grieving and instead of offering him support and love you're mad he's going to his gfs funeral and missing your wedding. Oh, poor you, he'll miss your wedding. His feelings don't matter do they? Just yours.", "I'm gonna go with YTA, for someone whose playing the family card you seems to know nothing about your brother or his relationships, his GF (LDR or not doesn't matter) of years just died, and instead of helping him grieve or checking his mental health you only ask him about what affects you, clearly your weeding is the most important day for you, but not for him( especially under these circumstances), as bad a brother you think he is you are an even worse sister.", "YTA. Even if he wasn't in love with her, he still thought enough about her to stay in contact and introduce her to his family. And people don't just fly to other countries for an acquaintance, that's an ignorant assumption on your part. The only correct thing in your whole post is that he gets to choose what he wants to do. He chose, and you are trying to dump on him while he's grieving. Get over yourself.", "YTA", "YTA his girlfriend died for Christ sake what the hell is wrong with you!!", "YTA.  It doesn't matter what Jack's relationship was with Katie,  he is grieving and needs to say good-bye.  You are being selfish and stepping all over his grief for what YOU want.  Get over your damn self and let him go say good by in peace.", "YTA. Like others have said this woman could have been \u2018the one\u2019 for your brother. Have a little compassion FFS. you\u2019re upset that a woman that meant a lot to him DIED and he won\u2019t be able to attend your glorified party. SMH. You\u2019re the one coming off like family doesn\u2019t matter to you at how you\u2019re coming at him in his time of grief", "Why do you think anyone cares about your wedding more than your brother cares ABOUT HIS PARTNER DYING. YTA.", "YTA. Are you actually for real? You are no where near mature enough to get married. Your selfishness is actually astounding", "YTA. He's spending days and probably a good amount of money to go; obviously he cared deeply for her. Look past yourself for once.", "Jesus christ. Please don't get married. Please don't have children yet. \n\nYou're not ready. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Weddings are important, but this trumps it. Your party DOES NOT come first than his girlfriend's funeral. You should be understanding instead of trying to guilt trip him. Shame on you. He needs to support you, but you can't find it in yourself to understand that tragedy happens?\n\nHe could have one day married her. If this happened with your fianc\u00e9 or your husband, wouldn't you like to go?", "Number 1 Bridezilla for the day, maybe week. \n\nYTA.", "Your brothers SO does and instead of expressing sympathy you\u2019re angry that he\u2019s missing your \u201cspecial day\u201d which is exactly like everyone else\u2019s. And he doesn\u2019t care about family? YTA", "TLDR: I'm a selfish AH who only thinks of myself and believes that everyone else should only think of me, too, on mY sPeCiAl DaY even though my brother is mourning the death of the person he loved. Family is only important to me if it benefits me because....\n\nI think we all understand. YTA op. Don't stress. There will be plenty of opportunities for your brother to attend your future weddings", "YTA. I can\u2019t even imagine being so selfish as to make someone I supposedly love feel bad for needing to grieve and say goodbye to their partner. And I wonder what your fianc\u00e9 must be thinking, entering into a marriage with someone so self centered.", "Yuck.", "For someone who is all about family it's obvious there's a reason your brother didn't tell you about the depth of his feelings for her. And what was your plan? To have him be sad at your wedding and then resent you forever?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Funeral/loss of a loved one trumps wedding. End of discussion. I get that it sucks for you but try thinking about how you would feel if it had been your fiancee and then apologize to your brother.", "YTA! You\u2019re so unbelievably selfish. Shame on anyone who agrees with you too (they likely just did in your face to keep the peace seeing how you lash out when you dont get your way). He wanted a future with this woman and lost her suddenly and you\u2019re showing ZERO empathy. Imagine if you were in his shoes and lost your s/o you planned to marry. Your behavior and the fact that you can\u2019t see how wrong you are is so concerning. I\u2019ll never understand brides not caring about others so long as they achieve their wedding vision. Truly disgusting behavior", "Gets my upvote as this man is grieving and you are banging on about your wedding. \n\nI think a funeral trumps a wedding. I feel sorry for him as you have shown not an ounce of compassion", "Literally, also how much would it feel like salt in the wound to miss your girlfriends funeral for a wedding!?", "This right here!", "To be fair, it's her family that decided on the date. How dare *they* not consider the wedding of their dead daughter's boyfriend's sister whom they have never met. I mean, didn't they get their RSVP to make no plans during OPs wedding that they were not invited to? How inconsiderate of them.", "When I tell you I snorted my iced coffee.\n\nTotally agree though", "Also saying \"you don't care about family\" when he is going out of his way to attend a loved ones funeral, does not add up.\n\nThat person could easily have been the mother of his children, and then they would be considered a family.", "My relationship with my partner now was also seen as a passing fling, a phase. No one, literally no one thought we'd still be together 20 years later. The audacity of this OP to have said anything other than \"I'm really sorry Jack. I will miss you at the wedding but I understand why you need to go\". You've broken it down well here.", "Excellent point!", "To be fair, the flight may only take 23 hours, but if you can't afford to fly direct you have stops and layovers, if you're in the US and the Airport isn't right there it involves driving time and car rentals. I also think acting like it's 5 days of travel is dramatic. But depending on your financial situation, it isn't unheard of to take a couple of days to travel internationally, in my experience as an American on the West Coast.", "I can't imagine being so entitled. Even her subject line \"last minute\" shows how greatly inconvenienced she feels at the fact that a life has been lost.", "Absolutely, I was just being sarcastic!", "Agree, just because she only met Katie once did not mean she was not close to her brother. \n\nIt is evident Katie was her brothers world. My heart goes out to him", "This.  I was shocked when I read he needed to attend a funeral.", "But he's  so flirty...couldn't possibly be serious (sarcasm)\n\nYTA", "With her attitude, brother can go to her next wedding. Entitled and selfish. YTA \n\nIt's called closure, OP"]}
