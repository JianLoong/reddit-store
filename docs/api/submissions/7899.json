Katie did come over last year, and me/our family met her a grand total of once in the entire time she was here.\n\nKatie sadly died in a crash recently. He's flying to London for her funeral, which is happening next week. It would be one thing if it was nearby, or even another state, but this is a whole different country that will take days just for travel there and back. He'll be missing my wedding, which he's a groomsman in.\n\nI told Jack gently, I'm sorry for what he's going through and I understand he's upset, but he's willing to miss his own sister's wedding for this.

It seems like Jack truly loved Katie and saw a future with her, and unfortunately a young life has been taken way too soon. A death of a loved one is very, very hard OP. Take it from someone who's lost her fiance.

He's grieving his girlfriend. Just because YOU only met her once doesn't mean that HE didn't have a very loving and meaningful relationship with her.

You're denigrating him, her, and their relationship because you weren't overtly privy to it? Sometimes he's flirty and thus this relationship is meaningless?\n\nThis myopia and cruelty will create a rift that he will have no compulsion to repair. This is not an affront to you or your (wildly fucked up) notion of family. He's not doing something to you. She sure as shit did not do anything to you. He is making the best decision he can in a truly horrible situation. \nThe way you seem to look down on him, is the only reason you care about his absence the idea of having an uneven wedding party?\n\nApologize. Profusely and sincerely. Tell him you are sorry for his loss and that you will miss him terribly at your wedding but that you understand.

It irritates my soul how some of y\u2019all  seem to think the world is supposed to stop and everyone must submit to your whims over your weddings. It\u2019s like you expect your wedding to consume his life and the lives of everyone else around you. Your wedding is a priority to you, the person you\u2019re marrying, and any of your family/friends who make it so. Your brother decided that your wedding is NOT a priority to HIM at this time.

Of course he needs to go to the funeral.", "YTA OP apologise to your brother if you want any hope of a relationship with him in the future.

You downplaying his obvious pain and suffering tells me your need to be center of attention for a day is more important than your Brother's emotional needs during during what is obviously a difficult time.\n\nYou actually told him that your need to spend a single day celebrate your already-existing-happy-relationship trumps his need to mourn and gain closure after the tragic loss of someone he loved? It's not even on the same tier of importance. In the big picture: nothing is going to really change after your wedding, its just a party. On the other hand, this women he once loved is gone - for fucking ever - that is truly life altering, and totally changes your priorities. Wedding and parties, suddenly seem a lot less important - don't take it personally. Instead try to feel some compassion for your brother, he needs it right now. Have you ever lost anyone close? If you have not yet, it may be a little too easy to downplay how hard grief can hit. \n\nIf your relationship with your brother is important to you - then I think you really owe him a heartfelt apology, and explanation that your reaction was inappropriate but based on your own sadness that he will miss a big day in your life.  Apologize for your bratty reaction - and tell him after a lot of thought from his perspective, you understand that is must be a difficult choice for him to make and you SUPPORT HIM in HIS TIME OF NEED.
