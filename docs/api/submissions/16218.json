I'm assuming that you also have a specialist here in the US if you've already been here a whole year. Does the school nurse have their contact info? From your recollection, it does sound like the school nurse is being dismissive of foreign doctors, but wanted to see if she has any valid claim for concerns.", "I've also met people with this misinformed opinion of medical professionals in other countries. The arrogance and ignorance shown by your school nurse would get under my skin too.  NTA\n\nP.s. 'Ola' from Spain! I'm currently on holiday in Aragon.", "NTA - Spanish doctors are just as competent as American doctors. However, pulling your medical files and tests and getting a second opinion or fresh eyes on the information isn't a bad idea. You wouldn't have to retake the tests, just have a second doctor review them.

I wasn't there so I can't really comment on whether the emphasis on American was actually there or if you were just being defensive.  I am having trouble giving a real rating.  I guess I have to go with INFO in that I think the interpretation really is dependent on the body language, speech tones, etc. and I do notice some defensiveness in your description.", "~~YTA.~~ If your condition is as rare as you say it is, I would definitely want a 2nd opinion from someone local who would likely be treating or advising me.\n\nNTA if you already have a 2nd opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Fellow Spaniard here with about 10 years in the US. First, it really sucks that you have such a condition. I hope the research gets better and better and they manage to get you to be attack-free forever.\nOn to the issue at hand. Your nurse sounds xenophobic, and that\u2019s sadly not that uncommon. I do hope it doesn\u2019t happen ever again to you. Spanish doctors are great; their education is incredibly solid and rigorous.\n\nBut as I said, you might experience some people looking down on things if they were done in Spain.

Just make sure this interaction doesn\u2019t have negative repercussions for you and stay safe.", "I'm not, but if she feels like the diagnosis isn't right, then she might undermine the gravity of my case. This includes scraping off the instructions given to the school in case an episode happens (for instance, we've told them not to call an ambulance since there's nothing they could do, etc). It'd be a whole mess", "You\u2019re right, I should\u2019ve said this:\n(1) No regular care would be needed. \u201cEmergency care\u201d would be basically waiting for an episode to go away. I can stay in the classroom when it happens, there\u2019s nothing to do, I\u2019m safe when I have an episode, I just need to be in a safe position and for no-one to freak out. In other words, it\u2019s not like a seizure or epileptic episode. \n(2) Many people have asked this and yes I\u2019m seeing an American neurologist for when my prescription has to be renewed and that kind of thing (that\u2019s actually one of the first things we did when we arrived). He agrees with the diagnosis, he saw all the test results and didn\u2019t challenge it. All this should be on my file, especially since they have a copy of my prescriptions (the most recent one being from this doctor)", "Of course, I have a neurologist. I have to go see him every six month to renew my prescription and potentially adapt the dosage. He never questioned the diagnosis and even agreed with it when I brought him all the test results and everything. He was also very surprised (he had only seen a few cases before), but said that it did exist and that the medical background in my family would explain why I was at risk", "Xenophobic, not racist. Spaniards are white. The nurse thinks the foreign doctor is incompetent.", "People from Spain, the country in Europe, are largely white themselves.", "No, she is not.  She's ignorant and an elitist.  Not a racist.", "Absolutely, and that's why I'm here. To describe the whole thing: I told her the name of the condition, she frowned, and then I told her about where the diagnosis was made her face changed completely. She raised her eyebrows and got quite condescending when questioning the diagnosis. I'm usually very calm when explaining it, but it irked me. Thanks for asking!", "I'm seeing a neurologist in Boston, since I need to have my prescription renewed every six months. He saw all the test results, all the scans, and said he agreed with the diagnosis, even if he had only seen a few cases in the past. But he was just as surprised as her, he just handled it differently. He said he couldn't think of any other tests they could run to challenge the diagnosis at the moment, and that the main thing was that the medication was working", "No no, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m happy with it. It\u2019s strong and has some side effects, but clearly it\u2019s nowhere near opiates. I\u2019ll probably be on it for all my life, but it\u2019s really manageable", "They're likely to be more worried about your family suing the school if they DON'T call an ambulance tbh. School districts care more about covering their asses than making sure students get the right care. Welcome to America!", "Then you do in fact have an American doctor validating, you haven't directly asked him to reinvestigate your case with fresh eyes, but if he disagreed he would have said so by now.", "Then the concerns of an \"American\" doctor are invalid because you already have a local doctor that is familiar with your case. Just explain to the nurse that you already have a doctor and he agreed with the diagnosis.\n\nEdit: Sorry, I forgot to add that your neurologist IS your second opinion.", "You might be right. But I\u2019ve dealt with that particular inflection of *American* before. I\u2019ve only ever heard it from whites.", "You were NTA and that nurse was extremely condescending and just a tad xenophobic. Tell your Dad the diagnosis was good enough while you were in Spain, what's the problem with it now that you're in the US? \n\nIn the meantime, I'd consider making a statement to someone at your school, just to record the incident. Much as I hate to speculate, a school nurse who doubts your condition and diagnosis as legit is more likely to dismiss your symptoms and any issues you may have at the school in the future :/", "Based on the fact that you know more about this than she does and your response to my post, I don't think you are the AH here.", "This IS your second opinion, NTA btw", "OK. It sounds like you DO have a 2nd opinion in the states. I'm gonna change it to NTA. Nurse is likely racist or xenophobic.", ">I'm seeing a neurologist in Boston\n\nBoston?\n\nIf you're seeing a specialist in Boston, it's probably at one of the big teaching hospitals, right? Chances are very high that your doctor is on staff at one of the three major medical schools in the city. And if not, they can easily consult someone who is just by shouting down the hall. So your school nurse can STFU, you do have a \"proper\" diagnosis from an American doctor.", "It\u2019d hypocritical of me to criticise American doctors, when I\u2019m asking of the nurse not to do this with Spanish doctors. My issue was just with her reaction regarding the origin of my diagnosis, and how she tried to invalidate it. I also think she should know that I\u2019m certainly seeing a neurologist here, since a GP is not specialised enough to know if my treatment should be increased or decreased. But you\u2019re right, I\u2019ll make sure to tell her next time I see her, maybe it\u2019ll make some of her \u201cconcerns\u201d go away", "The nurse herself might not be white, but that's neither here nor there.  \n\nIt's more along the lines of \"your doctor went to a state university? Shouldn't you get an opinion from a doctor that went to Harvard?\"", "Yeah except that Spanish doctors have just as good a reputation as American ones if not better. Given that the op got a noted specialist involved in Spain it''s more along the lines of your doctor went to Harvard, shouldn't you get the opinion of one that went to a state school.", "We\u2019ll get off topic in a hurry here, as I can see this winding people up. Regardless of all the above, *the nurse is the asshole*."]}
