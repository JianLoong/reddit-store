The only thing I can say is that it is MUCH better in the real world. Also, I work in a hospital in AMERICA and I don't even know what an American doctor is supposed to mean. Went to school in the US? I work with a lot of physicians who graduated all over the world. A lot of the physicians I know are Indian, Nigerian, Kenyan, Pakistani, some went to school here some in their countries of origin.  Are they valid? Or is it only Dr John Whiteman that we are supposed to listen to? NTA btw", "Your issue is valid. It does sound like she was trying to invalidate your diagnosis, even if that's not what she thought she was doing.\n\nA more appropriate question from her would have been to simply ask if you had found a new doctor to take over continued monitoring of your condition. Not to question the diagnosis itself. Just to ensure that you've connected with a doctor that was not an ocean away.\n\nAdmittedly, if she was trying to invalidate your diagnosis, I could see that question leading to an insistence that your local doctor provide an updated doctor's note. It could be used as a backhanded way of implying that the instructions already provided weren't good.\n\nDon't be surprised if she asks for that when you mention having a local neurologist that you're seeing.", "Legally, the nurse might have to have documentation from an American doctor to provide any form of treatment or accommodations. Especially if all the presented paperwork is in Spanish.", "Whether that\u2019s the case or not, that is not at all what the nurse said.", "Americans like to think the rest of us just live in 3rd world poverty shit holes, especially with our socialist health care.\n\nHow on earth could a doctor working for free be better than one rinsing and bankrupting their patients??", "Yet in my third world country I can get free insulin that would cost me 800$ each month just to live....", "Crazy, isn't it? You just have to respect the confidence that Americans believe going bankrupt for healthcare and weekly school shootings over gun control makes them the better country.\n\nNo thanks, I'll pass and take my \"freedom hating\" 1st world country over theirs"]}
