When registering for school in Massachusetts, the nurse is supposed to be provided with a current physical exam (usually within 6 months prior to registering) and a copy of your immunizations. If you have a condition where the nurse would have to provide care, i.e. asthma, diabetes, a seizure disorder, allergy requiring an epipen, there should be documents from your doctor giving the nurse her orders for when these episodes occur.  School nurses still follow doctors' orders. In order to give out tums, ibuprofen, etc, the nurse is following what they call standing orders from the districts doctor. So with a diabetic it's the same as well. A doctor will fax how they want the nurse to treat the student depending on blood sugar levels. So, I would recommend getting paperwork from your current doctor spelling your diagnosis out and explaining treatment in a school setting should an episode occur. I am not excusing her at all of her tone or behavior. I work in a school district as office support for our health rooms. All the nurses I have worked with are professional and take their job very seriously. They are the first responders in our schools. They do more than give out cold packs and bandaids.

I'm American born & raised, but I'm not dumb enough to think we're # 1, infallible, superior in all things. And our healthcare sucks on so many levels. I was in Kirea 10 years ago and was able to eat things that were made with fish/seafood/shellfish (I've got such a high food intolerance to these foods that I've been told I should treat them as an allergy) so long as I took what basically equivalates to an OTC med (go into pharmacy, as for the med, you buy it and take as directed.)

Nope. Not FDA approved. I have to deal with one of the most expensive allergy OTC meds here and it barely makes a dent in my symptoms.
