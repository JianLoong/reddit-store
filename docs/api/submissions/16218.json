I'm not sure how it works in the US, but in my country the school nurse can't even give you an acetaminophen. I don't think she'd have the authority to tell someone to not call an ambulance.", "I'd thank the Nurse for her opinion but say you'll stick to the diagnosis of the multiple Doctors, including the specialist in the field who your current American Doctor has agreed to follow his advice on, and continue with the working treatment. Maybe make a point to let the principle know you're concerned that the nurse seems unable / unwilling to follow basic instructions from your Doctor, which should also clearly be stated in your medical record.", "You can also get formal legal plans in place (making an IEP or another type of plan) which the school is required to follow, since this is a disability. It's not a learning disability, sounds like, but it would still qualify for a formal document that the nurse cannot change (and could lose her job if she doesn't follow.)", "[removed]", "I\u2019m saying - American life expectancy says that the nurse stressing \u201cAmerican\u201d healthcare isn\u2019t the flex she thinks it is.", "**NTA.

Especially school nurses.", "Because that's the way Americans think", "I think that there's a pretty common belief among certain subsets of Americans that our healthcare is inherently superior to any country that has universal healthcare, like Spain. So even if the nurse doesn't get a kickback, she probably thinks that paying out the nose for a diagnosis from an American doctor has a higher intrinsic value (because it has a higher price tag).", "> Why else would she get so pushy about OP visiting an American doctor.\n\nWell, maybe just because \"ya know, 'Murica numbah one, and rest of the world communist hellscape with no healthcare!\"", "That\u2019s just how Americans are dude, lol. If it\u2019s not American it\u2019s not superior in our dumbass eyes. I get your point, but the chance of a school nurse getting paid off to recommend foreign students to an American doctor is basically zero.", "Man, i went to the ER because walking hurt and i got an antibiotic for a UTI i didn't know in my butt and when i asked for any pain meds (like seriously*anything*) i got told \"no and nothing is wrong with you\" and then i had to hobble my way out the ER while holding onto my husband. No idea what the heck happened and no one could figure out what was happening so i just dealt with it. I haven't had an issue in a few months but i occasionally can't walk and have almost rolled/twisted/sprained my ankle the last few days that I'm actually worried I'm going to have a problem again while pregnant. \n\nDoctors hate listening to women so, yeah. I don't believe the American Medical System is all that great miss nurse. OP is NTA", "Eh.. yea.. but that one is probably actually true.

I have a lot of respect for nurses but that\u2019s just ridiculous. It\u2019s an extremely rare decease. How would a nurse know about appropriate medication for a decease which only 1 in a million have? The arrogance of that woman is astonishing. Her denial of the limits of her medical knowledge is dangerous. She didn\u2019t even listen to OP.

The others know our health care is expensive but nationalized health care is \"Socialist\" (they say it like it is the worst thing in the world).", "I think some Americans feel that way because then it kind of justifies the enormous cost.

Just get what you need from them.", "Americans seem to think that because their healthcare cripples them with lifetime debt for the simplest of treatments, that their healthcare must be cutting edge and world class, regardless of if it's true or not.", "It is always the job of every nurse to question something for which they are unsure.  Always.  If I am giving a med and I don\u2019t understand it, or think there may be a problem, I am definitely not taking liability for giving that med without asking questions.  That is literally our job to advocate and question.  We do not \u2018just follow orders\u2019 from doctors not licensed here, and this nurses inquiry seems perfectly normal and valid, not xenophobic as some allege.  All questions can be quelled with a simple note with a local physician licensed to practice in the United States.", "LOL right? Was the excellent Chinese ortho who set my son's broken elbow here in downstate Illinois an \"American doctor\", or not?
