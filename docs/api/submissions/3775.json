You need help for sure.  Mom is financially abusing you. I am not sure if at 16 you can set up your own account but if you can - you should! Immediately remove mom's access to your money. She should not be borrowing / spending your money.

Secondly if she's doing things that makes you want to tell your therapist about it then you definitely should! They might be able to help you in some way if you tell them what's going on.\n\nIn fact the only asshole here is your mom. And as reassurance heres the reasons why:\n\n1. Control freak. Makes you do everything her way even if you dont want to/it makes you uncomfortable. Invasion of privacy.\n2. Using/stealing your money. Taking your money and using it without your permission. Making you pay for things she's perfectly capable of paying for herself and should pay for herself.\n3. Lying. Says she'll pay you back then states that she won't.\n4. Emotional manipulation. Making it about her when you told her about your depression. When you're upset with her about something she turns it into an argument instead of trying to help you. Stole your money and when asked why she won't pay it back, despite saying she would, tries to justify it by saying you that you dont need it when it wasn't hers to spend in the first place. Worst and most telling of all she accuses you of not loving her when you decide to stand up for yourself and not meet her unreasonable demands.\n\nIf anything she's the one who doesn't love you. If she loved you she wouldn't treat you so horribly. If she ever tries to guilt trip you like that dont take her bs. Stand up for yourself if you feel it's safe to do so. Hell, show her my list of her wrongdoings if you need to! She is not in the right here. None of the things she does is okay.", "NTA !", "NTA. This is really worrying behavior from her.

If you want your therapist to help you have to be honest and let them know what's going on. You're smart enough to know you have to protect yourself from your mother and they should be able to help you, and help you find further assistance in removing yourself safely from the situation.

Do you have a friend/ trusted adult that can hold on to your money for you? Could you possibly get a prepaid debit card from somewhere like walmart and hide it? I would most definately tell your therapist and ask if she has any ideas on how to work with/around your mom. Are there any times that you can do things when your mom isnt around? Do you have a prepaid cell phone you can use in case of an emergency? I have a friends mom that started out like your mom has and it escalated into her trying to force her to stay under her thumb when she legally became an adult. \n\nThe Navy or Air Force are definately solid options if you know what you want to do in life. I would start studying for the ASVAB now so that you will breeze through it and have a few different options upon enlisting. Does your high school have an Rotc program or is there a civil air patrol group near you? These programs help build leadership and can really help your self esteem as well as give you a little bit of help prepping for the physical requirements of military life.\n\n I would also ask your mom if you can take up jogging. It will help with physical requirements as well as give you a vent for some of your obvious frustration at your current situation. \n\nOn another note i want you to know as a mom of teen girls close to your age, Im proud of you! You are doing your best to overcome your mental struggles and physical limitations your mom has imposed. You are so strong sweetheart. Never forget that. My inbox is always open if you need to vent/ talk to an outside person.\n\nMuch Love and Aloha!"]}
