Since living here we've had a problem with our housemate having their boyfriend here all the time (I'll refer to them as Lee and BF from now).\n\nFor context, four of us had been friends before and moved from a small town to an area that was more diverse and opportunistic for our wellbeing. We knew Lee online and had met them in person once before moving. Lee needed a new place so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to find a 5 bedroom house where the rent would also be cheaper. This house actually classes as a maisonette and was previously a shop that's been poorly renovated into a house so not only do we have many problems with it in general but there's not much room. 3 double bedrooms, 2 single bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and ONE shared space that is a kitchen/lounge combo. \n\nWe met Lee's BF on our moving in day as he helped them move in and have since considered him a really good friend. BF is also very helpful because Lee has a disability and feels most comfortable getting any help from him. We have made jokes about him being an extra housemate and have said genuinely he is welcome here any time- but this is so he feels welcome and wasn't meant to mean he can stay here all the time as we all agreed before moving we didn't want to live with a couple. \n\nRecently we've noticed he won't leave for a week, will for a day or so and come back to stay here another week and so on. We feel this is unfair for the rest of us as it already feels crowded for 5 especially when we're trying to cook, have a shower or wash our clothes/dishes. Not that we could accept or would even ask but he also doesn't pay or contribute anything needed in the house (even washing up) and has started buying and labelling his groceries with his name, using our fridge and freezer space (that again we are very tight on because it's small). \n\nWe finally caught on to all this and how he's straining our resources, finances and space here and called for a house meeting to address this with them (BF wasn't actually invited but he came down too which further proves our point). We went about it as nicely as we could and as a bunch of people-pleasers we had to keep stating how anxious we were to bring it up because we didn't want it to seem like a personal attack, we'd just prefer he was here less so it's fair.\n\nAs anticipated, it didn't go very well and their reactions were pretty anticlimactic, saying they didn't have anything else to say or give an explanation. Yet, over text the following day have been sending paragraphs being angry about how we brought it up wasn't something friends would do (which we did a meeting so everyone could speak equally and not behind people's backs/twisting words/over text). \n\nAre we the assholes for wanting him here less and did we go about that the wrong way?", "created_utc": 1674910981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nekwj/aita_for_not_allowing_our_housemates_bf_to_be/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Taking up space and being there so frequent can make him a tenant under law on its own.  I suspect your lease also has rules too about amount of people and guests.  Dont let them use guilt to control you.", "NTA\n\nTake a look at the lease. If there is anything about guests (most can't stay more than 14 days/month) without being added to the lease or the tenants being in violation. \nIf this is the case the remaining housemates can go to the property owner/manager and complain about Lee violating the agreement. You will also need to make clear that you do not want him added to the lease so Lee and BF don't use that as a workaround. \n\nYou might have to find a replacement housemate but when showing the space then have strong house rules in place (cleaning, sharing, volume levels if that could be an issue, and guests) that you can go over with them prior to taking them to sign onto lease.\n\nAlso next text from Lee then perhaps let them know you will be happy to arrange another meeting ... then make it tenants only (but still might want to go to property manager first)", "NTA lived in a 6 person house last year where absolutely everyone had a partner and it got SO crowded sometimes. Housemates who had their partners over more often than others a) asked if it was ok and b) paid extra towards the bills to cover what their partners were using. \n\nIt\u2019s totally ok for the rest of you to have boundaries for how much you want Lee\u2019s BF to stay, and staying that much without even asking you guys how you felt is pretty inconsiderate and crossing a line. If they wanted to be together all day every day they should have just lived as a couple. \n\nI don\u2019t think the way you brought it up sounds bad at all, it was always going to be awkward I think - no matter how you handled it. My advice for next steps would be to choose one of you as a sort of spokesperson (people can get very defensive when they feel \u2018attacked\u2019 by a big group, so 1 on 1 chats can be easier), and then sit down with Lee and explain how you feel again, as calmly and clearly as possible.", "NTA - He\u2019s using your space and some portion of your utilities while he is there. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to set some limits on how much time he spends there, especially overnight, and he should not be eating all his meals at your place.\n\nIf they aren\u2019t willing to make adjustments, then they should get their own place together or find someone willing to share a place with a couple. This really may be the only solution that works.\n\nI also think it would be fair to expect that they should be spending equal amounts of time at each other\u2019s place.   For example, if he spends two nights a week at your place, then they should be spending two nights a week at his.  I\u2019m guessing where he lives is not nearly as convenient for them, but that is not your problem.", "NTA. At this point he\u2019s living there and needs to contribute or leave.", "NTA - being roommate is a bit like living with relatives. You can't do whatever you want. And having the partner full time is one of them\n\nIf they want to live together, they have to find their own place", "NTA - Lee doesn't care about your house rules and neither does BF. You were extremely nice about it. Time for bf to go.", "This one is very easy.\n\nNTA. You didn't agree on having him as a housemate and his labelling his food in your fridge is absolutely bonkers. \n\nIf you're nice then you'll agree for him to pay in as an extra tenant owise time to say goodbye to them both.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t addressing the issue from a friendship perspective, it was from a housemate point of view. \n>\nThe boundaries were made clear in the beginning that you don\u2019t want to live with a couple. Not to mention that the BF is taking up resources. A guest does not behave like that.", "NTA. It's pretty poor etiquette to have constant overnight guests. A couple of nights a week seems acceptable. Regardless,  flatshares are a democracy and its 4 to 1.\n\nI am curious though, did you discuss the day to day impact of her disability prior to moving in? Does she require assistance that her flatmates can't give her? Is it possible for him to move in as a paying tenant?", "You should definitely talk to your landlord about this whole situation. I think your housemate's BF should also pay some part of the rent, so you and other people there could pay a little bit less because of one extra person living there with you. That's what my sister's landlord did. One housemate brought his girlfriend to live there with them, and obviously this girl also pays for the rent, so other housemates pay 50 pounds less now. I understand that you're not happy with it all. NTA", "NTA, and my landlord (apartment complex) would require a person living on the premises that much to apply as a tenant and be listed on the lease.

The least he could do is contribute to the housework. This guy seems really clueless.", "NTA best time to learn to stop being peoplepleasers. Lee could benefit also becoming less dependent on boyfriend. Did you talk about her disability prior to moving in? What she could do herself and what you guys are willing to help with? It now sounds she needs BF 24/7 When BF puts stuff in your freezer, he is living there > parttime.", "Esh Lee and bf  are taking advantage but you shouldn\u2019t tell someone they are welcome anytime when you don\u2019t mean it", "ESH\n\nRoommate doesn't get to have BF over for 95% of the time without contributing to the household. That's patently unfair, but....\n\n>BF is also very helpful because Lee has a disability and feels most comfortable getting any help from him.\n\nSo what did you expect to happen?", "NTA  I would suggest splitting the rent and utilities 6 ways then they can stay and it takes the burden off of you and the other person.", "NTA\n\nIf Lee is going to be there so often then he needs to pay his fair share. Rent, chores, household expectations, etc", "It\u2019s totally reasonable and you handled very maturely. It\u2019s just really too bad that early on you were all like come over anytime and they interpreted it as all the time.", "NTA. Read your lease.  What does it say about guests?  Lee is behaving as if he is also a tenant.  He either needs to be on the lease and pay for rent/utilities/help with household chores or leave.", "I\u2019m going to call it .  Op - slightly \u2014- YTA.  Everyone in that house is young.  Probably has active social lives and may want to be close or intimate with other people at sometime.  The same issue will point at each and everyone of you.  When the issue flips to someone else or even yourself how will you feel? When you are young 20s it can feel like the other person is the world to you.  I emphasize the words feel like.  Each relationship also has a honey moon phase and it doesn\u2019t last forever.  Usually 3 to 6 months.  I share my home with another woman but I don\u2019t dictate to her as an autonomous individual about her sex life.  She contributes to the rent.    I suspect even if your friends friend stays in her room they are using the same amount of electricity that one room would use.  Or the same electricity as other people if everyone is in the common space.  Hell even couples sharing the shower.  Might be a slight water increase.   Why should he have to pay more if he\u2019s being sheltered under space she\u2019s already paying for ?", "NTA", "Thankyou for your input! We had a discussion before moving in together since another housemate has a disability too it's important to communicate what may be needed from the rest of us. I don't know the ins and outs of Lee's care plan because between them and their boyfriend they've never said they needed more help than that and are very independent with their equipment and medicine, so 24/7 care isn't needed. I will say that's the only thing that we fully understand him wanting to be here for but obviously the rest of the problem still stands.", "Yes good idea. I once had a landlord help me get rid of an unwanted over-staying guest because her landlord insurance only covered those on the lease.", "That common pleasantry isn't an invitation to keep your own food in the fridge and live in the house though. Come on.", "Why does the OP suck then? NTA in my opinion.", "Thankyou for your reply and I get where you're coming from but we don't mind people having partners and one night stands because we're all friends, we love that even! Other partners visit and that's completely fine. It's just the lack of space.To put it into perspective- ideally it'd be 4 people and a spare room but there's now 6 people here, making it impossible to have your own time unless you're in your own room. The issue is also that he uses our appliances aside from sharing with Lee and we're pretty tight for money. The extra person is the last straw on the donkeys back lol", "I do think the disability may afford her a little more leeway with regards to overnight guests but the amount of time mentioned is still somewhat excessive. His presence is costing you money. If it's not possible for them to split the visits between his and your place then agreeing on an apartment wide rule (say, no more than three nights per week for overnight visitors) might be your next step. Should a room open up in the house you can give him first refusal too.", "I literally quoted why. Roommate is disabled and is most comfortable getting assistance from BF. That implies to me, at least,  that BF will be around assisting roommate quite frequently.", "And if you think about other partners visiting whilst he's already here.. capital C Cramped", "But all day everyday (and night) is an additional roommate. I could see helping for some stuff but dude needs to start paying rent.", "NTA. Tell Lee that BF has to go. If he doesn't, get your landlord involved. Lee is not entitled to have the rest of the house subsidize the expenses incurred by BF - you all are essentially paying for Lee's homecare.", "If his presence is tolerable just ask for a reasonable cash contribution to cover hot water, space, wear and tear", "NTA, and stand your ground. Lee is not acting like a very good friend here, and is trying to emotionally manipulate you guys into letting this go. Don\u2019t let it go. There needs to be a new house rule of \u201cguests can stay one night a week or we\u2019re getting Landlord involved.\u201d \n\nIf he continues to stay, it\u2019s time for him to pay rent. I\u2019d be petty and start throwing away his food since \u201che doesn\u2019t pay rent and therefore he doesn\u2019t live here.\u201d\n\nOf course they\u2019re mad- right now they\u2019ve got a sweet deal going on of two people living there for the cost of one person rent. That\u2019s disrespectful to the rest of you, and they\u2019re only mad because you\u2019re finally calling it out.", "They probably expected to have a roommate that could care for herself!", "Then wouldn't it make sense for Lee and the BF to find a place together or find a flatshare where they could sign the lease as a couple? \n\nThey can't just introduce a 6th unofficial flatmate without discussing it with the others. If he was going to need to be there so often, Lee should have discussed it with the other flatmates *before* moving in.", "Nta. Calculate all expenses and divide by 6 and give your roommate 2/6 of the bills. Her bf should pay his share of utilities and rent.  Or he stays no more than a couple of nights a month (and I'd make it no more than 1 night a week. )", "Flatshares aren't a democracy, they are an initial agreement that can be renewed at certain points. OP is definitely NTA but majority rule is not the reason, violation of the mutual agreement is. Imagine all five were bringing the SO around a reasonable amount and then the other 4 decided the fifth's SO couldn't come over at all because the fifth is gay and the others are bigots."]}
