You and your husband are in agreement on this. It\u2019s so refreshing when a couple sticks together. Your in laws made a decision based on their living preference, now they should stick to it. Expecting to be hosted once a month is way too disruptive.", "NTA\n\nYour house is just big enough for your immediate family. \n\nThe in-laws are trying to force themselves into staying in your house for free, and good on you guys for standing your ground", "NTA.

It's dramatic for your in-laws to say you're treating them as second class citizens strictly bc they cant stay with you. Sure, inflation makes things absolutely ridiculous but it's not your problem. They chose where to live and you were very up front that you do not have the space. Them constantly badgering you smacks of entitlement. Also, let's not forget that they're trying to use your kids to manipulate you and the situation. The audacity, really. Dont bend on this.", "NTA\n\nEvery 4/5 weeks is way too much even.

You and your husband have agreed to the boundary as well. So I feel the decision isn\u2019t on you alone", "NTA\n\nYou ensured they made an informed decision, even after their flightiness. You and your husband set clear boundaries. Any pushback you\u2019re receiving is disingenuous and unkind. Keep your boundaries firm. If you give them and inch, they\u2019ll take a mile.", "NTA.   Geez, I wouldnt want someone staying every 4 to weeks.  If they wanted to see the kids that much they shouldn\u2019t have moved so far.

They are ridiculous.", "NTA. My inlaws pulled this \"we move, you'll host\" business on my BIL, who basically couldn't say no because they bought his house for him... His wife *hates* FIL and MIL is her best friend. Its contentious when MIL and FIL visit them. Their original plan was MIL would visit every 4-8 weeks for 1-3 weeks at a time and FIL would come every other time, but more in the spring and summer. It worked out that she was there 4/12 months and FIL came 3/12 months. Then my BIL and his family moved to a new state (one ILs don't care for), so they looked longingly at our 900 sq ft, 2 work from home adults and a kid, hoping we'd open our home they didn't buy for us... fat fucking chance.\n\nYour inlaws have to sort their choices out, they need to own that they elected to be remote grandparents and their wallet suffers and their relationships suffer.

Having guests in your house more than once a month is a lot but maybe they can stay with you every other time (so only about once every 2 months) You have a 3 bedroom house. Are your in-laws difficult to get along with when they stay with you?", "This is weird to me as my family always makes room for each other in our homes.  Same with my husbands parents when they were alive.  I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole but I think you can compromise and allow them to stay every other visit.", "YTA. Sure this is your house and your rules, but this is a relationship your children will forever miss out on due to you not sparing a room/couch/air mattress etc. \n\nThe solution is simple but you\u2019re being entirely too hard headed and costing your children a regular relationship with their grandparents.", "NTA - but you could probably do better...\n\nYou have 3 bedrooms and animals and the grandparents chose to move 6 hours away, presumably with this arrangement understood beforehand. They want to visit every month for multiple days. I host couchsurfers and having extra people is a real stress. Not having proper space only adds to it.\n\nIt sounds like they're being kinda patient about it and they're jumping through hoops to see the grandkids so there are surely more perspectives to add here.", "YTA. I'm not sure why you keep referring to free accommodations - they're your family, they're spending time with your kids. I can't imagine not allowing any family member to stay with my family, let alone my husband's parents. It seems like you're annoyed that they moved far away and that this accommodations thing is a pretext for that annoyance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What their expectations are? Do you know how big her house is? Do you know what accommodations the in-laws want? Do they expect a bedroom or will they sleep on the pull-out sofa? Do they even have a pull-out sofa? Do they help out or expect to be waited on?\n\nYou've decided someone should compromise without knowing what those compromise are.

Our parents looked out for us as kids so it shouldn\u2019t be a burden to do the same for them. I also wouldn\u2019t call you an AH, but I think your stance is a little harsh.", "Same here. We always make room for friends and family, and if I'm in their town, I'm always welcomed to stay in their home too. One time, 20 relatives came to my house. I had airbeds everywhere, even next to my dining area. \n\nI would like to know if the inlaws have high expectations though.", "How is your grandparents coming to stay every month a regular relationship? \n\nWhy should op and her husband be the one to make a big sacrifice opening their open that often? To people who were told before moving they do not have space for them to stay with to visit to keep that in mind.", "My guess is that if the in-laws stay w/OP, they\u2019ll up their visits to every 3/4 weeks, as they originally wanted. They would more than wear out their welcome very quickly!", "Wtf?", "I wonder how op in laws expect to be accommodated if they did stay with them?", "I guess I grew up in a rather different family structure from you. Family gathering/visits were common and you were giving up your bedroom for a couple nights as a kid. No big deal.", "Yes but you were the kid. Not the adults in the house having to do the accommodations. You didn\u2019t take on the cost or deal with the stress. \n\nWe also do not know how easy or hard of guests op in laws are to say she should automatically open her home for them to stay with her.", "NTA - I would not say anything about mental health. I doubt they see that as valid at all. You do not have space for regular guests. Sure, you could accommodate the occasional need by putting someone up on an air mattress in the living room or making your kids temporarily share a room, but this is monthly (or even more frequent if they did not have to pay for a hotel) and that is insupportable. No one would be comfortable.", "Yeah we entertained this idea of this but you know as soon as it \u201cwent ok\u201d they would insist every time. I said they could take the kids to their place for 3 nights and they rang me back to say they are taking them for 7 nights! They don\u2019t seem to grasp expectations or boundaries.", "Yeah except that \u201cregular\u201d relationship actually ends up leaving my kids really distressed as they have stayed with us before and sharing a room impacts their sleep then they get upset that their grandparents suddenly leave, and yep they are SUPER difficult people to be around never mind have overnight.", "They\u2019re allowing the grandparents to spend time with their grandkids, that\u2019s not at all the issues. The grandparents chose to move further away. Not wanting a cramped uncomfortable living situation a quarter of the time based off the grandparents choice is really fair.", "Yeah totally annoyed that they moved so far away. My hubby is an only child and we begged them to stay close by. However we have loved with them in the past and it did not go well. I feel like compromising on saving them money will be a detriment to our relationship, however that\u2019s kinda happening anyway as they are unhappy. No one wins here I guess", "Yeah me too. My hubby too. And as kids we HATED it. So, maybe that\u2019s also a factor here? We don\u2019t want to put our kids through what we went through ?"]}
