{"id": 18237, "submission_id": "13slbfp", "title": "AITA for not helping my bf buy a car or want to move in with him?", "selftext": "So my bf(27M) and I(25F) have been together for 2 years. He doesn\u2019t have a car for the time I\u2019ve known him and he rents a room in house with about 8 other guys. Because of the amount of roommates and that it\u2019s in the bad part of town he only has to pay $400. I split rent with my roommate and $1000 for my share of the rent. He wants to move in with me but can only afford his $400 rent. So a one bedroom is about $1800 in my area so I\u2019ll have to pay $1400 and I don\u2019t want to. Thing is I can afford it since I take home $3800 a month after taxes but I don\u2019t want to pay an extra $400 a month and I don\u2019t want to move to the sketchy areas to save money. I\u2019ve told him if he pays $700 I\u2019m willing to pay $1100 but he says he can\u2019t afford it but I can so I should be willing to. So we keep living separately because we can\u2019t come to a consensus. \n\nMy bf makes $1800 after taxes and can barely afford things after paying rent/basics. We have been dating for a while and we should be moving in together and getting more serious but I don\u2019t know how to move forward with the relationship. Because he makes so little we can\u2019t do anything together unless I\u2019m paying and it\u2019s making me resentful. I don\u2019t pay for anything that costs more than a coffee which makes him resentful because he thinks I make more so I should be more generous. But he could get a better paying job in my opinion it\u2019s easy now to make $16-18 even at fast food places and he\u2019s makes $12.5 but he doesn\u2019t switch jobs. \n\nRecently he has had to make regular visits to his mom who is sick and also doesn\u2019t have a car which they needs to drive to appointments. I have a car but if he needs to go during working hours on a weekday I can\u2019t let him take it as I need to work. He has been getting angry with me for not letting him take the car or rearrange my work schedule to let him have the car and I told to take Ubers or ask friends but his \u201cfriends\u201d are always busy when he needs a ride. The Ubers are $50-$60 for each appointment so not very cost effective.\n\nLast week he asked me to co-sign a loan for a car so he can get one. It\u2019s $6000 and the interest rate is 16% which is insane. I told him I\u2019m not co-signing and he kept begging me saying he\u2019s called everywhere and no one will let him take a loans because of his poor credit and low income and he needs the car or I have to be willing to work nights so he can take the car (I\u2019m an LPN) which I don\u2019t want to do because nights really mess with my sleep schedule. I\u2019ve made it clear he needs to fix this himself and he called me selfish for not being willing to help him. I don\u2019t know how to help him because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of paying back the loans so I\u2019d just be giving him $6000 which I\u2019m not willing to do.", "created_utc": 1685127117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13slbfp/aita_for_not_helping_my_bf_buy_a_car_or_want_to/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s pushing you for money, rides, loans. What on earth is this guy bringing to the table that\u2019s keeping you there? It\u2019s not even coffee\u2026 so why is he worth the time? YWBTA If you stayed with this guy.", "NTA\n\nRe-read your own post. You've laid out all of the financial 'NO's' (red flags are flying!). He's not trying to get a better job, ' *can barely afford things after paying rent/basics.*  He's not even respecting the fact that *your* job is what's supporting him...'*rearrange my work schedule*'. \n\nNowhere in your post have you listed one single 'YES' about what your bf is actually doing to help. He doesn't respect your job; he doesn't respect you. *He brings nothing to the table.*\n\nDO NOT move in with this guy. He will *never* pay his portion of the rent (but will always have a nonsensical excuse). DO NOT co-sign *any* loan for him. There is a reason why '*no one will let him take a loan because of his poor credit and low income.'*  He will *never* pay anyone for that loan (you or the bank) and you will be on the hook to pay it. You can't help him because he refuses to help himself. Your bf needs to fix his own financial problems.\n\nYou already know this is not the kind of relationship you want. Do yourself a favor -- *listen* to yourself! You are not his 'sugar mamma.'", "NTA do not sign a loan for him he is not capable of paying said loan you know this and we know this.

If you move in with him or cosign a loan, you know you will be paying for \\*everything\\* yourself.  He is already flat out telling you he expects you to treat him because you make more money.  He will absolutely stop working and sponge off you if you let him live with you.  You are better than this (and frankly, you're better than him -- not because you make more, but because he's too much of a DA to make more)", "He\u2019s 27 and has no motivation to improve his life. NTA but dump him.", "nth get out, get out now!", "NTA\n\nIf he can't afford rent, he can't afford a car. Do you pay for all your dates too? Seems like he's just trying to take advantage of you.", "Get out", "NAH but why are you dating someone you have so little concern and respect for? You obviously believe that you are owed more than he can provide and admit to be resentful.", "Praise be to Judge Judy!", "Judge Judy would call him a bum and her a bum magnet for sticking around.", "Listen to this! There\u2018s a very good chance that eventually you will be paying for a former boyfriend\u2019s car.", "I paid $2300 for the car I could afford at a time I had bad credit. It was a 2001Chevy cavalier base model w 65k mi on it. I drove it for 5 yrs, then bought something on credit that cost 4x as much.\n\nThat was pre-pandemic and I replaced it in 11/19 when prices were going higher than lenders would value.
