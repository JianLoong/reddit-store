{"id": 18237, "submission_id": "13slbfp", "title": "AITA for not helping my bf buy a car or want to move in with him?", "selftext": "So my bf(27M) and I(25F) have been together for 2 years. He doesn\u2019t have a car for the time I\u2019ve known him and he rents a room in house with about 8 other guys. Because of the amount of roommates and that it\u2019s in the bad part of town he only has to pay $400. I split rent with my roommate and $1000 for my share of the rent. He wants to move in with me but can only afford his $400 rent. So a one bedroom is about $1800 in my area so I\u2019ll have to pay $1400 and I don\u2019t want to. Thing is I can afford it since I take home $3800 a month after taxes but I don\u2019t want to pay an extra $400 a month and I don\u2019t want to move to the sketchy areas to save money. I\u2019ve told him if he pays $700 I\u2019m willing to pay $1100 but he says he can\u2019t afford it but I can so I should be willing to. So we keep living separately because we can\u2019t come to a consensus. \n\nMy bf makes $1800 after taxes and can barely afford things after paying rent/basics. We have been dating for a while and we should be moving in together and getting more serious but I don\u2019t know how to move forward with the relationship. Because he makes so little we can\u2019t do anything together unless I\u2019m paying and it\u2019s making me resentful. I don\u2019t pay for anything that costs more than a coffee which makes him resentful because he thinks I make more so I should be more generous. But he could get a better paying job in my opinion it\u2019s easy now to make $16-18 even at fast food places and he\u2019s makes $12.5 but he doesn\u2019t switch jobs. \n\nRecently he has had to make regular visits to his mom who is sick and also doesn\u2019t have a car which they needs to drive to appointments. I have a car but if he needs to go during working hours on a weekday I can\u2019t let him take it as I need to work. He has been getting angry with me for not letting him take the car or rearrange my work schedule to let him have the car and I told to take Ubers or ask friends but his \u201cfriends\u201d are always busy when he needs a ride. The Ubers are $50-$60 for each appointment so not very cost effective.\n\nLast week he asked me to co-sign a loan for a car so he can get one. It\u2019s $6000 and the interest rate is 16% which is insane. I told him I\u2019m not co-signing and he kept begging me saying he\u2019s called everywhere and no one will let him take a loans because of his poor credit and low income and he needs the car or I have to be willing to work nights so he can take the car (I\u2019m an LPN) which I don\u2019t want to do because nights really mess with my sleep schedule. I\u2019ve made it clear he needs to fix this himself and he called me selfish for not being willing to help him. I don\u2019t know how to help him because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of paying back the loans so I\u2019d just be giving him $6000 which I\u2019m not willing to do.", "created_utc": 1685127117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13slbfp/aita_for_not_helping_my_bf_buy_a_car_or_want_to/", "score": 548, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can get a second job (I know it\u2019s unfortunate that in order to live comfortably some people need to work two jobs, but many of us do it to get by). \n\nAdditionally, there is nothing wrong with someone paying more for rent if there is an income disparity and that is the agreement, but there is something wrong with being taken advantage of. My pay is structured completely differently than my boyfriend (he gets more of a lump sum every other week, whereas I get by with my bill money and not much else until my commission bonus) and so we\u2019ve worked out a mortgage payment agreement that works best for us. He also eats way more than me and more than half the groceries we buy go straight to his stomach in a day or less, so it\u2019s rare that I foot the grocery bill. He also always insists on paying when we go out to eat, but I do when I can sneak my card to the server first. I also have expensive animals (horses), and a recently deceased cat that went through chemo last year, so my savings is shot. So, he\u2019s very willing to say he will cover this month\u2019s mortgage while I get my savings in order if I\u2019m really going through it with an unexpected vet bill or vehicle repair. But, I also do a lot of the mental labor of the house (ie scheduling appointments, keeping track of things that need fixed, making grocery lists, being responsible for what we need to bring when we go to social events, etc.) in order to make up for those things. I also helped him turn his credit around, showed him the value of saving money, and taught him how to maximize his 401k. However, I would NEVER expect any of this from him and made it by quite fine on my own before moving in with him. I also don\u2019t let him buy me unnecessary things- he has a lot of fun money left over every pay period and he enjoys spending money on himself and buying things. That\u2019s his prerogative and his money- when he offers to buy me something that is not an absolute need I never take him up on it. I am also actively looking for new positions that will put me more on his structured pay level instead of the quarterly bonus thing so that we are more equal.

They also would never ask me to co sign on anything ever though, they have not, and definitely will not.\n\nCould your BF also not try asking for a raise? Showing what competitive wages are? Say hey\u2026 I need 15$ an hour\u2026 or I will have to leave. I dont know what his job is, but even 15 an hour would seem to increase his income by a lot.\n\nYour goals in finances also dont seem to be compatible, he needs to learn to save his money, so he doesnt need to get 16% loan for 6k which is ridiculous. He can pay for it in cash, which usually paying in cash you can get a much better deal, probably get a 6k car, for 5k in cash, and wont be paying thousands of dollars in interest.\n\nIf my SO called me selfish though, over not wanting to co sign, they would not be my SO anymore. They are selfish ones.", "NTA and please get yourself over the mentality that you \"should\" be moving in together! He's obviously not ready for that and his entitlement to your money is worrying.

Telling you to work nights so your car is available to him is outrageous. He needs to grow up and either get a second job to supplement his income or a higher paying job.
