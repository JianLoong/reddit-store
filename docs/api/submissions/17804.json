He was a creep.  That\u2019s stalker behavior right there.  That\u2019d be enough to have me noping right out of that relationship.  If anything, you very much under-reacted to his legitimately scary, creepy behavior.\n\nIf he thinks a text message saying \u201cDon\u2019t do that\u201d is losing your shit at him, how do you think he\u2019s going to respond if you have an actual argument?  Because that right there is a man telling you that you\u2019re not allowed to be frustrated, annoyed, or upset with him.  Not allowing you to have any negative reactions to things is a very common abuser trait.\n\nAs for his friends saying this is cute, one of 3 things is happening: he\u2019s lying and never mentioned his creepy stalker behavior to them, or his friends are also creepy stalkers, or he severely misrepresented what he did.\n\nNTA, but please read the 6 foot tall neon letters his behavior has spelled out: RUN!", "Your boyfriend is old enough to be your father, stalking you, and gaslighting you when you feel uncomfortable.\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 RUN!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt seems like this is a red flag cause he has totally dismissed your feelings about the situation \n\nFWIW - I totally agree with you - its totally creepy behavior to *stalk* you via CCTV.  Note the CCTV reference - security cameras in places like malls are supposed to be *closed circuit* and personally I'd be wondering/asking how he got access to the footage!\n\nIn fact I'd go as far as contacting the mall and telling/asking how someone could possibly have gotten access to and take stills of me from their CCTV system!  I don't think they would be too pleased to find out their security system has been compromised either by someone hacking in or by a staff member using it for unauthorized personal reasons", "NTA and don\u2019t let him gaslight you.  What he did is straight up stalking, Idk why you are still with him.  He\u2019s 21 years older than you as well, he\u2019s absolutely insecure about you.  You\u2019re not deluded, but if you stay any longer, you\u2019d only delude yourself into thinking this is a healthy relationship\u2026", "You\u2019re not delusional.  You\u2019re NTA either.  This guy is a creep.", "NTA\n\nThis is really creepy and there is nothing \"cute\" about your partner stalking you.\n\nThe problem with creeps is they often attract equally creepy friends so I wouldn't listen to the views of his \"friends\" (assuming he actually asked anyone and isn't just lying about that).\n\nWhat do your friends and family think?", "NTA. You are NOT delusional for feeling creeped out. That is very weird for him to have secretly accessed footage of you (like a stalker) at various locations and you have every right to feel and voice that uncomfortableness.", "NTA \n\nYou need to take a really good look at other behaviours that often come from controlling spouses like gaslighting, controlling where you go, what you wear, what to think, etc. \n\nGoing to the lengths of getting access to that footage, sifting through it to track you and then sending you stills of it is not a spur of the moment spontaneous thing. This takes a while and he could have just stopped at any point because this is not normal. \n\nIf my spouse would do something like that I would immediately ask myself: \"How often has he done that before? Does he regularly track me like that? Did he show me these stills to show me, that he has the power to track me and control me?\"\n\nThis is not cute and nobody would feel that this is cute while in their right mind.

Feels like he doesn't see you as an equal (venting to friends is fine, venting to friends about topics you wont discuss with you SO that are about the SO is the problem)", "NTA - Super creepy.  Get out.", "NTA. I'm a domestic abuse survivor and in school for social work and this is screaming red flags to me.", "NTA. That sounds so creepy, you should get out of this relationship!", " NTA - What\u2019s even worse than his creepy violation of your privacy is that he is 1) dismissing your feelings/trying to gaslight you and 2) still not taking accountability for his actions. Who cares if his friends thought it was cute (which is highly unlikely btw). It didn\u2019t happen to them. Your feelings are the only ones that matter in this situation.", "NTA\nHis behavior is concerning.", "NTA - You had every right to be upset. That would be unsettling on many levels.", "NTA.

You stayed??", "A man that's nearly twice your age sends you stalkery photos, and you want to know if you're the problem? Your only problem is naivete. Ditch this creep.", "NTA, he\u2019s gaslighting you. This is very concerning and ngl I\u2019m worried for you.", "NTA! Run girl! This is super creepy and controlling behavior (and possibly illegal!) Often times behavior like this escalates. Plus there\u2019s the obvious gas lighting going on. My advice is get yourself a counselor/therapist and plan an exit strategy. Controlling narcissists are notoriously difficult to break away from. Get out while you still can.", "NTA. I'm not even sure how his intentions could be interpreted as cute. What's cute about saying \"I can see you, wherever you go\"?", "Serious question, what happens if you break up with this guy? He\u2019s already stalking you while you\u2019re dating him, you don\u2019t wonder how his behaviour might escalate if you decide to leave him? You\u2019re under reacting here, if this is the behaviour he\u2019s willing to show you openly, I would seriously fear what he\u2019s hiding underneath it. Don\u2019t wait until he\u2019s trapped you (financially, or in marriage or by pregnancy) to finally realise that this guy is dangerous to you. Get out. NTA but you would be to yourself if you stayed.", "NTA This is messed up.  He hacked security footage and cyberstalked you. I feel uncomfortable and violated for you.  He clearly has skills, I'd be getting my car, home, cell and laptops checked out for cameras, tracking devices and spyware.  To be fair, I've been watching true crime shows lately, so maybe I'm being paranoid but that is not normal behaviour.", "Red flags. \n\nThat behaviour is NOT normal, and his assertions that you are \"delusional\" and have made him \"seem like a creep\" is emotionally manipulative to make you doubt yourself, isolate you from family and friends.\n\nAlso, the fact that he seems \"like a creep\" is because he is. People don't stalk their partners - it is not appropriate.\n\nGood luck, look after yourself.", "I\u2019m sure whatever he did to get those photos was illegal..", "You\u2019re delusional for dating him, girl!", "Oh, well, if his friends think he did no wrong, that's OK then/s.\n\nIt was odd. \n\nIt was an invasion of your privacy. \n\nThe person who got these stills for him may have acted illegally and certainly inappropriately and the company they work for would not be impressed. \n\nYou dont know of he's still checking up on you and just not telling you. \n\nIt's the sort of thing \"bad guys\" do in films/TV as the precursor to the murder spree.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI don't think you're hearing what people are telling you. \n\nThis guy, who could be your father, is literally stalking you. \n\nTracking you through public security system is incredibly worrisome and disturbing behaviour. It doesn't fall into the category of \"trying to flirt and falling flat\". It's \"police needs to get involved\" territory.\n\nImagine him doing this but not sending you the pics. Imagine that he's probably doing this but NOT TELLING YOU when you're out and about. Imagine him just \"checking up\" on you when you're out, just to make sure you're doing what you say you're doing. \n\nI'd already be incredibly worried about the huge age gap, but this would give the whole relationship a very different, and terrifying, aspect.", "NTA please check your apartment for cameras/listening devices. I\u2019m scared for you", "Ok so... after reading this and then reading your responses to other peoples' comments..... you're dumping him right?", "My parents used to tell stories of being high school sweethearts. Apparently, my dad was just so head over heels in love that he would skip school quite often and wait outside her classroom window.  He would scare off any boy that came near her. He'd laugh telling us about how he broke the arm of some kid that asked her out on a date once. They think he left town because he never came back to school. We thought they were cute, funny stories for the longest time, mostly because we were dumb kids that didn't know any better. As we got older we realized just how fucking horrifying that story was. We also noticed that my mom had been totally isolated from her friends and family over the years. And how she wasn't allowed to have an opinion. The realizations got worse and worse the older we got and the more we worked on our own traumas.   \n\n\nJust because this asshole thinks his behavior is normal, doesn't mean it is. The huge age difference is also a big red flag. Shitty guys often target younger women because the ones his age don't put up with his shit. And I say this as a woman with a man that is 15 years older. Not every large age difference is bad, but the trend is big enough that some deep self reflection needs to be had just to make sure you aren't blinding yourself to things that you are still able to escape. You don't want to have this conversation with yourself after kids have been brought into the mix.", "NTA creepy af and I say this as a wife who openly admits and sneaks pics of my husband ALL the time (ie mowing the lawn in front of my office *click* fall asleep with the cat *click* etc) but they\u2019re personal photos for me (even though he hates them) sending security footage he\u2019s got no reason or way to access creepy", "NTA. So many red flags!", "NTA, and that behavior was EXTREMELY creepy.\n\nCheck your bathroom and bedroom for cameras, OP; chances are good he hasn't limited himself to getting security cam images of you. Check your car for an air tag as well (there's an app you can use to detect them); he might be tracking you that way too.\n\nThis is not a safe situation for you. Please consider finding a friend to stay with, or going to stay with family.", "WTF?! \n\nNTA!!!\n\nCreepy and noncey af. Report to the police and get out of there!!", "NTA. \n\nWow. I don't think that's even legal. He hacked a public security system. Did he suggest you work from home? I'm betting he's monitoring you more than you are aware. Check your car for a tracker. Have a mechanic put it up on a lift.  When he's not home check the house for cameras and microphones. Bathrooms,closets, lights, everything. Red flags are everywhere.", "NTA.  This is really creepy behavior.  Add in the fact that he's old enough to be your father and I'm literally shuddering.  Run.", "I\u2019d get the hell away from this creepy af dude. That\u2019s some stalkerish crap right there.", "Nta. That sounds like something that needs to be reported to the police. That he found other creeps to surround himself with doesn't not make him a creep. No one who thought that was ok should be trusted.", "There's a reason he seems like a creep. The reason is that he's a creepy ass stalker. I'm willing to bet everything I own that the only reason he's dating someone twenty years younger than him is so he can control you. You should get the hell out of this relationship yesterday. Don't walk away. RUN away.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat he did was likely illegal. \n\nHe's playing on a powerdynamic of the 'older & wiser' man in order to make you feel like you are overreacting. Generally, large age gaps like this lead to abuse of the younger partner, even if it's not physical and more about control. He obviously felt safe pushing this boundary which is very worrying. \n\nYou underreacted by only sending him that text and not breaking up with him and going to the police. \n\nBe careful when you do break up with him (which you need to do once you see the light).
