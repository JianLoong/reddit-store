He was a creep.  That\u2019s stalker behavior right there.  That\u2019d be enough to have me noping right out of that relationship.  If anything, you very much under-reacted to his legitimately scary, creepy behavior.\n\nIf he thinks a text message saying \u201cDon\u2019t do that\u201d is losing your shit at him, how do you think he\u2019s going to respond if you have an actual argument?  Because that right there is a man telling you that you\u2019re not allowed to be frustrated, annoyed, or upset with him.  Not allowing you to have any negative reactions to things is a very common abuser trait.\n\nAs for his friends saying this is cute, one of 3 things is happening: he\u2019s lying and never mentioned his creepy stalker behavior to them, or his friends are also creepy stalkers, or he severely misrepresented what he did.\n\nNTA, but please read the 6 foot tall neon letters his behavior has spelled out: RUN!", "Your boyfriend is old enough to be your father, stalking you, and gaslighting you when you feel uncomfortable.\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 RUN!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt seems like this is a red flag cause he has totally dismissed your feelings about the situation \n\nFWIW - I totally agree with you - its totally creepy behavior to *stalk* you via CCTV.  Note the CCTV reference - security cameras in places like malls are supposed to be *closed circuit* and personally I'd be wondering/asking how he got access to the footage!\n\nIn fact I'd go as far as contacting the mall and telling/asking how someone could possibly have gotten access to and take stills of me from their CCTV system!  I don't think they would be too pleased to find out their security system has been compromised either by someone hacking in or by a staff member using it for unauthorized personal reasons", "NTA and don\u2019t let him gaslight you.  What he did is straight up stalking, Idk why you are still with him.  He\u2019s 21 years older than you as well, he\u2019s absolutely insecure about you.  You\u2019re not deluded, but if you stay any longer, you\u2019d only delude yourself into thinking this is a healthy relationship\u2026", "You\u2019re not delusional.  You\u2019re NTA either.  This guy is a creep.", "NTA\n\nThis is really creepy and there is nothing \"cute\" about your partner stalking you.\n\nThe problem with creeps is they often attract equally creepy friends so I wouldn't listen to the views of his \"friends\" (assuming he actually asked anyone and isn't just lying about that).\n\nWhat do your friends and family think?", "NTA. You are NOT delusional for feeling creeped out. That is very weird for him to have secretly accessed footage of you (like a stalker) at various locations and you have every right to feel and voice that uncomfortableness.", "NTA \n\nYou need to take a really good look at other behaviours that often come from controlling spouses like gaslighting, controlling where you go, what you wear, what to think, etc. \n\nGoing to the lengths of getting access to that footage, sifting through it to track you and then sending you stills of it is not a spur of the moment spontaneous thing. This takes a while and he could have just stopped at any point because this is not normal. \n\nIf my spouse would do something like that I would immediately ask myself: \"How often has he done that before? Does he regularly track me like that? Did he show me these stills to show me, that he has the power to track me and control me?\"\n\nThis is not cute and nobody would feel that this is cute while in their right mind.

Feels like he doesn't see you as an equal (venting to friends is fine, venting to friends about topics you wont discuss with you SO that are about the SO is the problem)", "NTA - Super creepy.  Get out.", "NTA. I'm a domestic abuse survivor and in school for social work and this is screaming red flags to me.", "NTA. That sounds so creepy, you should get out of this relationship!", " NTA - What\u2019s even worse than his creepy violation of your privacy is that he is 1) dismissing your feelings/trying to gaslight you and 2) still not taking accountability for his actions. Who cares if his friends thought it was cute (which is highly unlikely btw). It didn\u2019t happen to them. Your feelings are the only ones that matter in this situation.", "NTA\nHis behavior is concerning.", "NTA - You had every right to be upset. That would be unsettling on many levels.", "NTA.

You stayed??", "A man that's nearly twice your age sends you stalkery photos, and you want to know if you're the problem? Your only problem is naivete. Ditch this creep.", "NTA, he\u2019s gaslighting you. This is very concerning and ngl I\u2019m worried for you.", "NTA! Run girl! This is super creepy and controlling behavior (and possibly illegal!) Often times behavior like this escalates. Plus there\u2019s the obvious gas lighting going on. My advice is get yourself a counselor/therapist and plan an exit strategy. Controlling narcissists are notoriously difficult to break away from. Get out while you still can.", "NTA. I'm not even sure how his intentions could be interpreted as cute. What's cute about saying \"I can see you, wherever you go\"?", "Serious question, what happens if you break up with this guy? He\u2019s already stalking you while you\u2019re dating him, you don\u2019t wonder how his behaviour might escalate if you decide to leave him? You\u2019re under reacting here, if this is the behaviour he\u2019s willing to show you openly, I would seriously fear what he\u2019s hiding underneath it. Don\u2019t wait until he\u2019s trapped you (financially, or in marriage or by pregnancy) to finally realise that this guy is dangerous to you. Get out. NTA but you would be to yourself if you stayed.", "NTA This is messed up.  He hacked security footage and cyberstalked you. I feel uncomfortable and violated for you.  He clearly has skills, I'd be getting my car, home, cell and laptops checked out for cameras, tracking devices and spyware.  To be fair, I've been watching true crime shows lately, so maybe I'm being paranoid but that is not normal behaviour.", "Red flags. \n\nThat behaviour is NOT normal, and his assertions that you are \"delusional\" and have made him \"seem like a creep\" is emotionally manipulative to make you doubt yourself, isolate you from family and friends.\n\nAlso, the fact that he seems \"like a creep\" is because he is. People don't stalk their partners - it is not appropriate.\n\nGood luck, look after yourself.", "I\u2019m sure whatever he did to get those photos was illegal..", "You\u2019re delusional for dating him, girl!", "Oh, well, if his friends think he did no wrong, that's OK then/s.\n\nIt was odd. \n\nIt was an invasion of your privacy. \n\nThe person who got these stills for him may have acted illegally and certainly inappropriately and the company they work for would not be impressed. \n\nYou dont know of he's still checking up on you and just not telling you. \n\nIt's the sort of thing \"bad guys\" do in films/TV as the precursor to the murder spree.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI don't think you're hearing what people are telling you. \n\nThis guy, who could be your father, is literally stalking you. \n\nTracking you through public security system is incredibly worrisome and disturbing behaviour. It doesn't fall into the category of \"trying to flirt and falling flat\". It's \"police needs to get involved\" territory.\n\nImagine him doing this but not sending you the pics. Imagine that he's probably doing this but NOT TELLING YOU when you're out and about. Imagine him just \"checking up\" on you when you're out, just to make sure you're doing what you say you're doing. \n\nI'd already be incredibly worried about the huge age gap, but this would give the whole relationship a very different, and terrifying, aspect.", "NTA please check your apartment for cameras/listening devices. I\u2019m scared for you", "Ok so... after reading this and then reading your responses to other peoples' comments..... you're dumping him right?", "My parents used to tell stories of being high school sweethearts. Apparently, my dad was just so head over heels in love that he would skip school quite often and wait outside her classroom window.  He would scare off any boy that came near her. He'd laugh telling us about how he broke the arm of some kid that asked her out on a date once. They think he left town because he never came back to school. We thought they were cute, funny stories for the longest time, mostly because we were dumb kids that didn't know any better. As we got older we realized just how fucking horrifying that story was. We also noticed that my mom had been totally isolated from her friends and family over the years. And how she wasn't allowed to have an opinion. The realizations got worse and worse the older we got and the more we worked on our own traumas.   \n\n\nJust because this asshole thinks his behavior is normal, doesn't mean it is. The huge age difference is also a big red flag. Shitty guys often target younger women because the ones his age don't put up with his shit. And I say this as a woman with a man that is 15 years older. Not every large age difference is bad, but the trend is big enough that some deep self reflection needs to be had just to make sure you aren't blinding yourself to things that you are still able to escape. You don't want to have this conversation with yourself after kids have been brought into the mix.", "NTA creepy af and I say this as a wife who openly admits and sneaks pics of my husband ALL the time (ie mowing the lawn in front of my office *click* fall asleep with the cat *click* etc) but they\u2019re personal photos for me (even though he hates them) sending security footage he\u2019s got no reason or way to access creepy", "NTA. So many red flags!", "NTA, and that behavior was EXTREMELY creepy.\n\nCheck your bathroom and bedroom for cameras, OP; chances are good he hasn't limited himself to getting security cam images of you. Check your car for an air tag as well (there's an app you can use to detect them); he might be tracking you that way too.\n\nThis is not a safe situation for you. Please consider finding a friend to stay with, or going to stay with family.", "WTF?! \n\nNTA!!!\n\nCreepy and noncey af. Report to the police and get out of there!!", "NTA. \n\nWow. I don't think that's even legal. He hacked a public security system. Did he suggest you work from home? I'm betting he's monitoring you more than you are aware. Check your car for a tracker. Have a mechanic put it up on a lift.  When he's not home check the house for cameras and microphones. Bathrooms,closets, lights, everything. Red flags are everywhere.", "NTA.  This is really creepy behavior.  Add in the fact that he's old enough to be your father and I'm literally shuddering.  Run.", "I\u2019d get the hell away from this creepy af dude. That\u2019s some stalkerish crap right there.", "Nta. That sounds like something that needs to be reported to the police. That he found other creeps to surround himself with doesn't not make him a creep. No one who thought that was ok should be trusted.", "There's a reason he seems like a creep. The reason is that he's a creepy ass stalker. I'm willing to bet everything I own that the only reason he's dating someone twenty years younger than him is so he can control you. You should get the hell out of this relationship yesterday. Don't walk away. RUN away.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat he did was likely illegal. \n\nHe's playing on a powerdynamic of the 'older & wiser' man in order to make you feel like you are overreacting. Generally, large age gaps like this lead to abuse of the younger partner, even if it's not physical and more about control. He obviously felt safe pushing this boundary which is very worrying. \n\nYou underreacted by only sending him that text and not breaking up with him and going to the police. \n\nBe careful when you do break up with him (which you need to do once you see the light).

Multiple laws have been broken here. This is a serious crime and you need to go to the police. But you also need to plan and do it safely. \n\nI say this as someone who\u2019s worked in security. As well as someone who was stalked for almost 7 years and almost killed. Some folks are downplaying this, this man is dangerous. You need a safety plan when you leave. You also need a safety plan to talk to police. \n\nWhen browsing for info on this, use a library computer. In a pinch, use something like DuckDuckGo on your computer. Search local women\u2019s shelters and give them a call. Find someone you can stay with that he doesn\u2019t know. When you leave. Anyone who knows your location MUST know not to share it. I found older friends and relatives the worst for giving out my info thinking it\u2019s harmless. It\u2019s not. \n\nMake a separate email you only access from the library or a friend\u2019s device. With this level of control. I worry he\u2019s got access to your system and passwords. You might consider a new phone after leaving and changing all passwords. And make them long and hard to guess. A vault like 1Password does cost money but can help you make long (over 20 digit random) passwords that are hard to guess. Never go under 14 characters. There are programs on line that can crack 14 digit or less, passwords in less than 7 minutes. They are free and easy to download. \n\nAny calls you make to leave, try to use a TRUSTED friend\u2019s cellphone. For police, or women\u2019s shelters or to new accommodations. \n\nYou may also need to not just ghost him, but any mutuals in your life. This part hurts. But is 10000% necessary. I learned the hard way that mutuals were being sent to me to try and get info or pass on messages. \n\nGet yourself counselling. Probably the most underrated part of what I\u2019m saying. You need a counsellor who understands abuse. If you have a local women\u2019s centre they are amazing resources. (Different than shelters)\n\nWhen you go to the police. You\u2019ll also need to mention the mall. I know folks are saying contact the mall. But they may go into crisis mode to cover their own ass as it\u2019s highly illegal if a staff member gave access to these photos. Or they can also be liable if hacked. If there\u2019s lawyers at your local women\u2019s centre or shelter. They can help with this. When I say this is serious for the mall, the employee could lose their security license and may end up with fines or jail time. The mall could also end up liable under their license to have security guards depending on your province. \n\nWhen you leave, depending on your province, you may have access to 6 days of time off (Alberta does this for example) to leave and get yourself safe. It also gives you an opportunity to let your employer know not to give out info on your work schedule, or if they know where you\u2019re working from remotely, along with personal info to anyone on the phone, or by email. Same with in person, but it\u2019s harder in person to just call and pretend to be a family member or someone with real reason to get that info. \n\nIf you need to get items from your home that you share, your local police might have a \u201cdrive by\u201d service. Where you and friends go and get your things, and the police are there to keep him from interfering with you. \n\nI cannot express enough how unsafe this person is. They\u2019ve willingly broken laws to show you they can control you. \n\nNone of this is your fault. You are not over reacting or crazy. And it sounds like he\u2019s even convinced you to gaslight yourself for him. None of this is ok. None of this is him being loving. Your feelings are correct. And I suspect that deep down you know what he did was VERY wrong. Do not feel guilty if you go to the police. It\u2019s not you getting him into trouble. It\u2019s his actions that can get him into trouble. Not yours. You would just be protecting yourself. And please talk to a lawyer and counsellor. Services to access both for free exist. \n\nPlease take care OP.", "THE MAIN ISSUE IS THAT YOU'RE IN DANGER.", "This is not a mistake. This is absolutely controlling behavior and your response was normal.

Run, as fast and far as you can, because he won't leave you alone if he knows where you are.", "I need you to listen to me, and listen well: he has already demonstrated MULTIPLE abusive behaviors.  He has stalked you, gaslighted you, and punished you for having an exceptionally mild reaction to his abuse.\n\nThis is not the time to wait and see if he gets worse.  This is the time to cut your losses and get out.\n\nI\u2019m sure he started with love bombing you, so you think he\u2019s sweet.  The intense, \u201cloving\u201d pursuit he gave you at the beginning is part of how abusers operate.  They get you hooked on the idea of a great guy who doesn\u2019t exist, and then they start the abuse.  The \u201cgreat guy\u201d facade at the beginning exists so they can set the hook and reel you in.  It never really existed.  Like a fishing lure - it\u2019s a chunk of plastic shaped to look like something fish like to eat, when all it really is, is a hook delivery system.  The \u201clove\u201d behaviors at the beginning were to make you feel like you love him so you will stay as he abuses you.\n\nAbuse in a relationship is like finding shit in a sandwich.  Even if the filling is 98% perfect, a sandwich that is 2% shit is a dangerous, harmful thing you should not consume.  You\u2019ve just found multiple lumps of shit in this sandwich.  Even if you thought it was the most perfect, delicious version of your favorite sandwich - even if it seemed like the Platonic ideal of a sandwich - you should be throwing it out and spending some time cleaning out your mouth and thinking about why you\u2019re tempted to accept a shit sandwich.  You now know there is shit in it, and that statistically, it is likely that the shit to goodies ratio will only get worse the more of the sandwich you eat - that\u2019s how abusive relationships work.\n\nIf you get out now, you can still recognize the taste of shit and spit it out.  If you continue eating shit sandwiches, you will slowly lose your ability to recognize the smell and taste of shit, because you\u2019ll become used to it.  You may even start believing that you deserve to be eating things full of shit, because consuming it over and over breaks you down.\n\nI\u2019m speaking as a survivor of abuse, who has worked with many other abuse survivors.  You are experiencing dangerous red flags.  Abusers only get better if they believe that what they are doing is wrong and do a HUGE amount of work in therapy.  This man believes that they way he abused you is *right and normal*.  That means he is not going to get better, and is **very** likely to escalate.", ">I\u2019ll be very vigilant to other controlling behaviours if any appear and be sure to be firm in my boundaries.\n\nWhat!?! You need to see **more** controlling/stalking/creepy behaviors before you (checks notes) set boundaries? How many different ways does this man have to show you who he is before you believe it? \n\nWhat makes you think you can just have firmer boundaries with someone who is literally surveiling you and trying to gaslight you out of your very normal feelings about it?

This relationship isn\u2019t just bad, it has the hallmarks of turning dangerous.\n\nIn your position I would:\n\n- Make sure I had finances he couldn\u2019t access, and all my identity documents, personal treasures and other items I couldn\u2019t leave behind already stored somewhere safe he can\u2019t get to them.\n\n- Had a plan for where to go where he couldn\u2019t find me, likely safe with family or friends he would be unable to physically confront, if I needed to walk out the door suddenly; or had security systems installed at my home if we didn\u2019t share a place.\n\n- Tell him the topic of his stalking you that day (and use the word; keep calling it stalking; \u201cyou followed me without my consent and scared me, it\u2019s stalking\u201d) will only be closed when he explains to you and shows you *exactly* how he did it. You need this knowledge.\n\n- When this goes further and you are ready to leave, do so with a safety plan. Guy has all the hallmarks of escalating.\n\n- If he has a firearm in the home, multiply the level to which this should be frightening by about five. A controlling man sharing a home with you with a weapon accessible to him is a significant threat to your life.\n\nPlease stop dating terrible people who are this much older than you. He is dating you because nobody his own age wants him, because they can identify his fucked up behaviour more easily. He thinks you\u2019ll be easier to keep trapped.", "He straight up did this to show you he can and will find you anywhere you go. It was never meant to be cute. \n\nHad it been meant to seem cute he wouldn\u2019t be defensive and saying you are wrong cause his friends say so. \n\nThis was controlling and was meant to send you a message, you should heed that message.", "\u2018Misguided attempts to flatter me\u2019 is a cute way of saying \u2018stalking\u2019. Get out. NTA but you will be if you stay with him. You keep making excuses for him so don\u2019t know why are you even asking. God knows what he did already and you don\u2019t even know about. This is something you *do know* and this is way too creepy and concerning that there\u2019s no way you told him not to do it and so he just\u2026stopped", "As another 50+, hard agree. Not only that but you bring up something else- how does she know he\u2019s stopped stalking her? All she knows is that he stopped sending her the photos. She should\u2019ve dumped him immediately.", "No one of any age group thinks this is OK. This is proper not OK.", "Absolutely. It's legit stalking. It's incredibly f***ed up.", "Our botanic gardens have a public webcam that's always broadcasting. Might be the same thing here.", "The cameras could be listed as citycams where the intent is for people to watch the cameras. For seniors who mallwalk, if they can\u2019t get to the mall on any given day they like to \u201cpeople watch\u201d via the cameras and it helps them find comfort in their routine. In outdoor spaces, checking a camera will tell someone who lives 1-2 hours away if the weather is nice enough to make the trip down.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 could have simply googled \u201cmall name camera\u201d to get to this, then thought \u201cit would be cute of me to behave like a goddamned psycho as a way of showing her that I was thinking of her and can\u2019t get enough of her.\u201d\n\nHe thinks this is cute because he\u2019s an immature goddamned psycho, and that\u2019s also why he\u2019s breaking the \u201chalf your age plus seven\u201d rule to begin with. \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddec", "Another great book is \u2018See What you made me do\u2019.", "I could believe it. Lots of abusers have a circle of passive yes friends who back them up no matter what. My ex abused me and the girl before me yet the friend group stuck around even after they saw it firsthand. They seemed like nice normal people on the surface, it\u2019s bizarre. They\u2019ll do mental gymnastics to excuse their mate\u2019s behaviour because \u2018loyalty\u2019.\n\nETA: wording", "I'm kinda curious how they met, did he somehow know things she loves? Was he all too perfect and treated her just right? Because if that was the case then what if he had been stalking her? I mean there's the age gap. Also OP doesn't seem to want to leave even though she's aware it's a possibly abusive relationship, so is he loaded or she's just ignoring reality?", "OP, please hear this... If on *his end* he truly intended for his actions to be seen as cute, he would have been *horrified* that you found them disconcerting.\n\nThe fact that he reacted by telling you that *you* overreacted and dismissed your concerns speaks volumes to how he views his relationship with you. And not in a good way.\n\nHow would someone react if they'd intended it to be a power play? How would they react if they were *looking* to make you feel uncomfortable and disconcerted?", "There is a book I wish all women would read called The Gift of Fear. That discomfort you've felt is 100% on target and I wouldn't dismiss it. Whether he even knows it or not, he wanted you to know that, if he wants to, he can find you. NTA pls reconsider this relationship", "Idk man... it seems to me that OP is continuing to claim the intentions were good.\n\nGlossing over areas she disagrees with online commenters and acting vaguely agreeable about it is kinda par for the course for victims in the thick of DV and psychological abuse.\n\nI'm just saying, the responses I'm seeing are pretty spot on with what I've heard in the past from DV victims not quite ready to leave their S.O.", "Yep. The other thing I\u2019m concerned about that I haven\u2019t seen mentioned yet is that he doesn\u2019t work there or in anything to do with security. I\u2019m seriously afraid of what will happen if OP does leave him (as she should) because she will never really be safe. If she continues to go there or any places he knows she goes, he could - and likely would - continue to stalk her (and that\u2019s what it is, OP) if they broke up. It\u2019s really terrifying to think about it. It\u2019s absolutely NOT forgivable, OP, and the fact that you know it\u2019s not cute and is creepy should tell you everything you need to know about him. I\u2019d honestly be going to the police if I were you.", "It\u2019s so obvious he is still doing it and I am one hundred percent certain doing it to \u201ccatch\u201d her talking to a guy so he can confront her. So, so scary. And worse she just wants an apology. I hope she reads the comments and leaves this creep", "I agree with your sentiment but please refrain yourself from using our countries' flags to make a point.", "Thank you very much, I will look into that one too!", "Sorry but NOW you sound delusional. Yu aren't delusional for feeling violated and creeped out by his behaviour, but DEFENDING him when it's nothing short of a Mount Everest of red flags definitely IS delusional.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if he consciously intended to be malicious or controlling (and at 48 years old, this shouldn\u2019t be a factor unless he\u2019s got some sort of disorder that has inhibited/is inhibiting him). \n\n**He still was.**\n\nAnd his reaction to you voicing discomfort was to throw a tantrum and gaslight you. \n\nAs someone who has been in your exact shoes, it is **only** going to get **worse** from here. \n\n**RUN.**", "Dude, he was testing you. Now he knows that he can make you think twice about whether or not you were wrong. I married a guy like this that would do \u201ccute\u201d things just like this and gaslight me until I thought I was crazy for also not thinking it was cute. And SO I STAYED. Don\u2019t forgive and forget. Don\u2019t think you can change him or that he will learn from this. He is training you on how you should react to his behavior and it\u2019s only going to get worse", "I\u2019m honestly confused about how this would not be construed as controlling. I feel like I could maybe understand if they were cell phone pics taken from him and sent right before he popped up and said something like \u201csurprise i thought I\u2019d stop by and maybe we\u2019d have lunch\u201d but sending you pics from a system he shouldn\u2019t have access to? It sounds like the beginning of Lifetime movie. If you were watching that movie, wouldn\u2019t you think this was a one of those \u201cin retrospect, that should have been a warning sign\u201d moments?", "Girl, come *on*\n\nYou know, deep down, that this is a bad and dangerous situation. Now you're being obtuse."]}
