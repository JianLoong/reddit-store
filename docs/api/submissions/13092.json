Thanks autocorrect!\n\nLast weekend, my best friend was getting married. We\u2019ve known each other since we were kids, so we\u2019re pretty close with each other\u2019s families. My mom was invited. I served as maid of honor. My mom was due to arrive with the regular guests. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a wedding, you know the morning of is stressful and you don\u2019t really have a lot of down time. In the half hour leading up to the ceremony, we were having celebratory shots, doing final touch ups on makeup and getting ready to walk down the aisle. Dress did not have pockets, I was leaving my phone in the dressing room. \n\nNow, this was a pretty big wedding so as I walked down the aisle and then stood with the rest of the party, I didn\u2019t really notice who was there and who wasn\u2019t.\n\nPost ceremony was the traditional group shots and what have you. So of course, I\u2019m not looking at my phone. \n\nFinally, we make it to the reception for the end of cocktail hour while my best friend and her husband sign the marriage certificate, have a moment to themselves, etc. That\u2019s when my mom storms over to me and asks why I wasn\u2019t answering my phone. I was so confused. That\u2019s when she showed me hers and that she had texted me multiple times.\n\nShe showed up 5 minutes before the ceremony and couldn\u2019t figure out where to park. Then she couldn\u2019t find where the ceremony was being held (it\u2019s a big property with lots of venues). By the time she got there, the ceremony was underway and she decided to not make a spectacle and just hide out in another area until the reception started.\n\nKeep in mind, my friend included a sheet with detailed instructions on all of these things with the invitation. My mom said she had forgotten it at home and would it have been so hard to answer her texts. \n\nI reminded her: I was apart of the damn wedding! I didn\u2019t have time to look at my phone. She claims that there had to be some down time. There honestly was but I didn\u2019t think to check my phone. I was trying to make sure everything was going to run smoothly.\n\nLuckily, no one was nearby and this didn\u2019t disturb the wedding in any way. Friend and her husband were blissfully unaware that she wasn\u2019t even at the ceremony and my mom did get over it. We all had a great time at the reception.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot.

She's one of those people who has no one but herself to blame, so of course she blames you.\n\nThe only reason you are questioning yourself now is because she is pushing your buttons. She can push them because she installed them.", "NTA. Who made you responsible of your mom? She\u2019s an adult, and she should\u2019ve been more responsible.

It sucks that your mom forgot the sheet and missed the ceremony, but it's totally reasonable that you didn't have your phone on you.\n\nIn all likelihood she was actually probably really mad at herself and was taking it out on you in the moment. Which isn't okay either, but I'm glad you two got past it and were able to have fun at the reception.", "NTA.

That's just your frustrations out on someone else....\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  As maid of honor, your obligation was to focus on the wedding ceremony, not to wait by the phone for your mom to text.  This can't have been her first wedding.  She should have been well aware that there would be nowhere left to park five minutes before the wedding.  Everyone else at the wedding managed to get there on time and find the way to the venue without your help.  Your mom should have done the same.", "NTA! It\u2019s not your fault that your mom didn\u2019t plan to be there early enough to get seated for the ceremony. As someone who\u2019s been in a few weddings, there is definitely no real downtime, and if there IS, you\u2019re there to support the bride/groom and be present with them on their special day.

You mom is being ridiculous.", "NTA,  Mom knew you were part of the party and if she couldn't figure things out on her own that's on her not you.

Your mother should have called *anyone* other than the bride or groom. As you point out, a wedding is a complicated, stressful event.

I can feel the stress building in me just typing it. \n\nIt\u2019s a blowup you laugh about later. She was just stressed. If she still feels this way two weeks later, then I\u2019d reassess but definitely not blaming her for being flipped out in the moment. And definitely not blaming you for not having a phone on you. You are in the wedding party. Your attention should be 100% on those duties before, during, and after the ceremony.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
