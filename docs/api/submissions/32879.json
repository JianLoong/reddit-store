{"id": 32879, "submission_id": "18gnvfu", "title": "AITA for insulting the food my wife made, despite not knowing she made it?", "selftext": "I will try to keep it short. My wife and I are 46 and 47. We've been married 19 years now and not once in our marriage has she ever cooked. I honestly never minded, she's told me that she's terrible in the kitchen and I like to do it anyway.\n\nYesterday, I had a long long day at work and told my wife this. She told me she would order food in so I didn't have to cook.\n\nI come home, and she sets the table, the food is neatly placed on two plates (which should have been my first clue that it was home-cooked) and I began to dig in. The food was bland, borderline gross and nothing to what I had tasted before.\n\nMy head was already pounding, I was not in the mood for some shitty food. I just looked up from the food and told her, \"This fucking sucks. Please don't order from this place again.\"\n\nShe got really quiet, and then sad. I asked if everything was okay and she said yes. She still seemed off the whole dinner.\n\nAfter dinner, I wouldn't stop bothering her. Wouldn't stop asking her what's wrong. Until she finally snapped and told me she cooked the food, it wasn't ordered. She said she was sorry and she won't cook for me again, and I could see her tearing up. She went right to bed.\n\nI had to leave early the next day, so she was asleep. I asked a buddy of mine for advice and he said I shouldn't have talked about anybodys food that way.\n\nAITA? Or honest mistake?\n\n**Edit for clarification: I did not mean this in a derogatory way at all. My wife and I have lived in the same area our entire marriage and very often come across an absolutely terrible takeout place. It's a thing we do, saying: God this sucks. Usually, the response is a laugh, because we have a tally of the horrible places and we find it funny. My fault for not specifying that.**\n\n**Edit: Unrelated to the topic but those of you shitting on my wife for not cooking are out of fucking line. So what if she doesn't want to cook a meal? She doesn't like it, I do. So I do it. She's not stupid, she can learn if she wants to but does not have the enthusiasm. If she really needs to, she will learn. She can do whatever the fuck she wants because she helps doing other things that I wouldn't like to do. Comment about whatever you want but going after my wife not cooking is fucking pathetic.**\n\n**Last edit for Update: Got Home yesterday, with flowers and a bottle of wine. Sat her down and told her the food wasn't restaurant quality but I thought it was great for a beginner. She said she'd like to learn a little bit of basic cooking, so I'm going to teach her, for whenever she wants to cook. She laughed about it a little, about how bad the food was.

Few points\n1. OP cooks every day they are not ordering often\n2. He didn\u2019t know the food was cooked by his wife (assuming he\u2019s telling the truth)\n3. He commented \u201cit fucking sucks, don\u2019t order from here\u201d which is not an extreme statement as he\u2019s talking about the place and not wife.\n\nThe only way he\u2019s an AH is if \n1. He knew that she cooked the food\n2. He\u2019s supposed to be always be formal in his language around his partner\n\nNTA. But apologise for your mistake\n\nEdit: I mean Not The Asshole. Some people pointed out that it should be NAH. I don\u2019t know the difference\n\nEdit 2: of course the wife is not the asshole lol. After reading the comments it should be NAH", "NTA. (1) You didn\u2019t know she cooked it, and many people will order takeout but take the time to plate it, I know my partner and I do when we share something we ordered from a restaurant or if the to go box is flimsy/broken. (2) Whether it was ordered or home cooked, you don\u2019t have to pretend you love it. When my partner and I cook, if we don\u2019t like something about what the other person cooked, we tell them. Albeit, both of us can actually cook, so it\u2019s usually just like \u201chey, you overcooked the shrimp\u201d or \u201cyou should use less paprika next time\u201d, but we\u2019ve both had occasions where one of us cooked something and it turned out awful so we\u2019d be honest and say \u201chey, this sucks, don\u2019t cook it again\u201d. If you lie and say you liked it, then the other person is just going to keep cooking that meal the same way, and then you\u2019re stuck pretending to enjoy terrible food every time they cook it.\n\nHowever, you should still apologize to your wife for hurting her feelings, and maybe suggest that y\u2019all go to some couple\u2019s cooking classes together. Make them date nights, y\u2019all can spend quality time doing something together and your wife can learn how to cook at the same time.", "Everyone saying it\u2019s rude you said it sucked but that\u2019s not rude.

All of these comments and votes about \"he should have been nicer\" are completely irrelevant. Could the pronouncement have used different words? Of course, but that wasn't the question. I could point out that it's been 19 years, why hasn't she learned how to cook? See? Just as irrelevant.\n\nOP didn't like the food. Was he an AH for stating that the food was terrible? No.\n\nNTA\n\nAnswer the actual question.", "NTA - but I think a lot of that hinges on how I'm picturing the situation. \n\nYou say you order from places, and every now and then find somewhere that sucks, and you tell the other person 'this is awful'. I don't see it in a mean way, it's just a thing you do. You both do it, and the roles could have easily been reversed  You had no idea it wasn't takeout, you can't be blamed for not knowing that and also not liking bland food. \n\nI don't see it as you overreacting. Sometimes I order food. When it fucking sucks, I'll say that it fucking sucks.\n\nHowever - your wife is definitely justified to be upset. She'd clearly wanted to surprise you, and I'm sure she'd imagined you enjoying it, and then there's a big reveal 'oh guess what - I COOKED THIS!' and you'd be impressed and it would be a whole thing. She probably built this whole thing up, which just got dismantled instantly. \n\nPeople who don't cook for 20 years probably know they can't cook. I don't think it was so much the realisation that the food was bad which upset her, more that she tried to do a nice thing, and it backfired \n\nJust my guesses. My wife also doesn't cook so I just put myself and her in that situation and tried to guess at what she'd be mad at. (But as I've found out, I'm never correct at knowing why my wife is annoyed at me)", "Honest mistake nta also your wife sounds lovely and cute \ud83e\udd79 she tried.  I think if you explain for someone that doesn't cook she did a bloody decent job and you probably could've added salt or something but you were tired lol you genuinely thought she paid a professional and got ripped off and you'd laugh about it like in the past and when she didn't you couldn't help but pester her because it's uncommon and uncomfortable for you to see her down about something.  Then just remind her how much you appreciate her and all her efforts.", "NTA, and I honestly do not get the Y T A votes! Jeez, it was an honest mistake!", "NTA but you should apologize. I don\u2019t think your response was rude because as you said, you guys both do this.

Many people plate takeout because it\u2019s easier to eat and it just feels a little better to eat off of real plates. Unless you saw pots and pans in the kitchen, how were you supposed to know she changed her mind?", "NAH but this is a sad story. Make it up to your wife. I feel bad. You had a long day and she surprised you so you didn\u2019t know it was home cooked so you\u2019re not an AH- but also you hurt your wife a lot. My feelings are hurt vicariously just reading this.", "NTA because there's no realistic way you could have assumed she made this meal after almost two decades of NEVER making a meal herself AND hearing it from her own mouth that she would order food. Anyone voting YTA can't understand OP was basically lied to.", "NTA because you didn't know it was home cooked (Only had clues), however i do hope you really apologised to her afterwards.", "NTA I hope she can laugh about this later. She wanted your honest opinion and you gave it to her.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you take her on one of the couples cooking classes for a date night? Or maybe the two of you try making a recipe together? Then you can both be at fault\u2026.\n\nOr better yet, cook something awful and then she will be the better cook of you both. \n\nYou can turn this into a win. Trust me.", "Ah alright, if you\u2019re just saying the same shit you say any other day then yea, NTA.", "Okay first of all, I love that you're defending your wife's choice to not cook. It's a tell tale sign of a good relationship when each other knows their strengths and weaknesses and it sounds like yall have a good balance. As a wife who also prefers to not cook, and my husband does it mostly - if I made him a meal and he responded that way, I would be cruuuuushed, but I wouldn't be upset with him if he genuinely didn't know. But I Would be really hurt, and would appreciate an apology. Maybe after hurt feelings are smoothed over, this could be an opportunity for you to teach her some things in the kitchen, and you can laugh about this in a few months? I wouldn't blame your wife for being upset, but in this situation I would say you were definitely NOT the A-H. Just because feelings are hurt doesn't necessarily mean there is a villian or someone to blame.", "Dude. Just read edit #2, and you rock.  \n\nNTA.You might want to explain to her what you said in edit 2. She doesn't like to cook, so she never expended the energy to learn.  If she wants to learn now, you could invite her into the kitchen with you, and you could teach her.   Who knows, it might be fun for both of you.", "Lmao this thread is whack as fuck and full of people who can't cook. Getting offended because he said food he thought was takeout was shit. NTA", "NTA. I don't know why people are saying you're the asshole!!! Yeah man sometimes food can suck and if you'd have known this is her food then you'd have judged it accordingly, ie, taking into consideration the fact that she hasn't ever cooked before  etc etc. We expect a baseline level of quality from restaurants OBVIOUSLY which is why you judged it the way you did.\n\nI would still apologize and say that it had already been a tough day but i appreciate and love the effort and i would like to cook together etc etc.", "NTA.\n\nYour comment was hurtful, and for that you should apologize, but it wasn't intentional. She told you she would order takeout, you ate the food you thought was takeout, and made a comment about how this takeout food is not good.\n\nFor people claiming OP \"should have known,\"... Oh, please. The wife literally hasn't cooked in *almost two decades*. We are *long* past the point where OP would have any reason whatsoever to assume that the food was cooked by his wife.", "NTA. I mean, you didnt know she was the one that cooked the meal, its not uncommon to say a takeout sucks, if you think its takeout. Tho I understand why she felt upset", "Dude you\u2019re totally NTA. This was an honest mistake just sit her down later and give her a genuine apology. Tell her you appreciate her effort and if you had realized it was home cooked you would have never insulted her like that. It was a long day and you never intended to hurt her that way. If you want to go the extra mile maybe go home early and make her a homemade meal or order her favorite food!\n\nI put take out on plates all the time people in the comments are being wild out here for you not realizing.", "If you really didn't know she cooked the food, you're NTA\n\nIf she never cooks, it would be hard to assume that she did cook this particular time.", "NTA\n\nShe literally told you she was ordering food. You had no reason to believe she had made it, she lied to you. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to talk that way about ordered food at home, the chef isn\u2019t there to hear you, and you\u2019re making sure the person who ordered knows the place is bad so they don\u2019t order from there again.\n\nI doubt if you knew she\u2019d made it you would have said it.", "NTA\n\nWe all talk smack about restaurants if we don\u2019t like their food or takeout.

I\u2019d bet your friend wouldn\u2019t have made that comment if it hadn\u2019t been your wife who cooked. Of course you can judge food you think you\u2019re paying for.", "NAH. Your wife tried to make you a home cooked meal, didn't do an especially good job, and didn't give you any warning to moderate your criticism to protect her feelings. However, you did insult her cooking pretty brutally. Neither of you made asshole choices, you just ended up on the wrong side of a miscommunication. \n\nI'd suggest a romantic gesture for your wife - maybe reservations at a restaurant she loves and a gift related to one of her true skills? - and an apology for hurting her feelings. Reassure her that her intent was kind and lovely, and that you adore her no matter how well she can (or can't) cook. \n\nGood luck man - and make sure to schedule some downtime for yourself as well!! It's the holidays and both you and your wife deserve a break.", "Nta, you were tired, you were hungry and you didn't realise. Its an honest mistake, these things happen in marriage, and yes she's probably devastated and you can do a lot of apologising. Maybe cook together and teach her 2 or 3 simple meals!", "NTA, I don't think its fair she set you up. HOWEVER,  you should apologize for hurting her feelings because that's what loving people do. Ask her if she would like to start to cook together and/or take a cooking class. Tell her what you told us that you thought you were doing your regular funny food critique bit and had you known she made the effort would have been more thoughtful.  She may have wanted to do something nice for you. Which you missed entirely.", "Gonna buck the trend here and say NTA.\n\nIn nearly 20 years, she's never cooked a whole meal for you, and she explicitly stated she was going to order takeout. \n\nAlso, the sticking point for me is that you noticed she was upset, asked her if everything was okay, and she said \"yes\". *She kept saying everything was fine, that she wasn't mad, that she was not upset.* \n\nShe somehow expected you to read her mind and know that she was in fact upset, despite saying she wasn't, and why.\n\nThat's not fair to do to anyone, especially a partner. \n\nShe ought to have used her words like a grown up, and been able to say, \"y'know what, I had changed my mind and decided to cook for you - *I* made that food, and what you just said hurt my feelings. I'm not really ready to talk about it right now, but I need you to know that.\"\n\nYour reaction was completely based on the information you were given, which you had no reason to doubt. As far as you knew, your wife *who doesn't cook* ordered takeout and put it on plates. You reacted in the way you both have in the past, when having bad takeout. \n\nIt may have been unintentional, but your wife set you up to fail- either by liking the food (and \"proving\" that she's a better cook than you've said before) or by not liking the food (and insulting it without knowing she made it and hurting her feelings).", "NTA, but you should apologize. \n\nYou didn\u2019t know she cooked it and that\u2019s a reasonable comment on terrible takeout food.", "NTA\n\nI've said this with food I've ordered or I've said to whoever I'm with to not let me order this again cause it sucked so its hardly aggressive.\n\nSince your wife has clearly stated she doesn't know how to cook, Idk why she felt the need to start on a night that you said you were tired and had a long day.", "NTA", "This seems like a truly innocent mistake on OP's part, at least as written. NTA.\n\nIf genders were reversed and if a guy who has never cooked for almost 20 years makes something, goes out of the way to pretend it is takeout, and gets bad feedback, would the comment section react the same way? I don't think so.", "NTA but I do feel sad for her, she shouldn\u2019t have said she ordered takeout and I\u2019m sure it hurt to hear. You did nothing wrong, that\u2019s just the way it goes sometimes", "If it was actually bad, and you actually didn't know, NTA. \n\nTake cooking classes together... or YouTube. Whichever works.", "NTA, but you should have apologised to her immediately for being rude about the food. Also maybe tell her that you're sure she'll do better next time, it _is_ only her first time cooking. Offer to show her the ropes maybe so she gets better.", "NTA Totally honest mistake. But that doesn't mean that you don't owe your wife a massive apology.", "NTA \n\nShe said she was gonna order food so it\u2019s right if your to assume that it wasn\u2019t made by her. \n\nQuestion for you, have you thought about offering to cook together step by step? I feel that this will help ease the tension from this situation and create a larger bond tied to cooking. That most likely took a blow to her self esteem so I believe that this will make good memories with cooking and help her improve and learn", "Hi, married to DH 14 years and I don't cook he does it all. Most of the men do the cooking in my family cause they like to. Good for you for not pushing these old stupid ideas that women have to cook and like it. NTA", "NAH. \n\nI believe you when you say this is a normal way y'all talk about take out, and that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings. But, you DID hurt her feelings. It's not the end of the world though. I would apologize to her, and also say that you really appreciate her trying to do something special for you. Another commenter offered cooking together to help her learn & I think that's a great idea (it's also how I helped my partner learn how to cook).\n\nAs for \"pestering\" her when she seemed off: I would avoid that in the future. Personally, I need time to process hurt feelings and put words to them. If someone comes at me and demands an immediate resolution, it will cause more conflict because that is just now how I process emotions. In the future, I think a better option would be to say something like \"I can sense that you're upset and I want to help. Can you come talk to me when you feel ready?\" Or something similar. Letting someone know that you're there for them & are ready to talk when they are has really helped in a lot of my relationships.\n\nSorry for all the weird comments. You seem like a good dude who just stuck his foot in his mouth. Happens to the best of us.", "Honestly, I think if you apologize for having hurt her feelings and maybe offer to show her what you would have done differently, it shouldn't be a big deal. \n\nShe hasn't spent years learning the skills of cooking, so the standard for her food is different than a restaurant. \n\nNAH", "Just be kind I don\u2019t think your the AH. Even I don\u2019t like my own cooking sometimes.", "As much as you hurt your wife, NTA. You didn't mean to and that's the important part of it. You thought you were talking about a (I assume) restaurant made meal that sucked. I'm sure had you known it was your wife's cooking, the expectations and taste would've been different. Love changes those things and the effort tends to make food taste better.\n\nAs others said, I think you should apologize. Make sure she knows that it wasn't personal or directed at her. For her cooking, perhaps you could engage her more when she helps you? Offer her to help you with seasonings and such? Cooking can be a great activity to bond with your partner and if she learns a bit during it, there's no harm in it. Ofc with her knowledge, that is.", "NAH.  You did not know that she cooked the meal and tried to surprise you.  Had you known you most likely would have reacted differently.  That said, you do know that her feelings were hurt.  Maybe get her flowers or something to show that you feel badly that you hurt her, no matter how unintentional it was and tell her you are sorry.   A little kindness goes a long way.", "Wow! You really have her back! I wish there were more spouses like you around!\nNTA - honest mistake. Apologize and offer her a nice dinner out.", "NTA, it was an honest mistake and you clearly feel remorse for unintentionally hurting her feelings. I especially like your edit sticking up for your wife not liking to cook. I, too, am a lousy cook, while my hubby is an excellent cook and actually likes cooking. I also do a lot of other things that he doesn't like to do, and we are happy, which is all that matters. Sounds like you're in the same boat. Your wife's heart was clearly in the right place and I think yours is, too. I do think that you should apologize; let her know that you appreciate her thoughtfulness and the effort she put in to do something special for you. Remind her that you don't mind her not being the world's greatest cook, since she's so great at \\[name a few things she's really good at that you aren't as good at\\]. Ask her if she wants your help learning to make more enjoyable meals, ie cooking together, getting her a recipe book for beginners, see if she wants to take a cooking class. If not, that's okay too - you support her in anything she wants to (or doesn't want to) learn or do. Maybe you could also place a takeout order from her favorite restaurant the next time she's having a rough day.", "NAH.

No. We DO shield the ones we love from those inconsequential let-downs. I literally told my ex-GF I loved every single gift she ever got me. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Ended up in a box and then that box got tossed when we broke up. Why did she buy me a coke spoon? I've never done coke in my life. Why did she get me a decorative wine bottle corker?

The dynamic between you two seems fine but it feels like you got baited here a bit.

I would definitely do a bit of groveling just to smooth things over.

She TOLD you she was ordering out. You kinda slide into AH territory for not apologizing right away and uplifting her for the effort.

Saying not to order from that place again is the icing. \n\nI'm gonna be honest it's hard to recover from. Nta but damn did you fuck up.

It\u2019s fine to talk about disliking restaurant food with your partner, and since she said she would order something, you thought it was restaurant food. \n\nShe also is understandably hurt because she tried something new and did an activity she dislikes only to be told it sucked.

Society rips apart women and anything they like. Anything women like gets ripped apart. They make fun of them for getting excited over K-pop stars yet men will literally throw riots if their favorite sports team loses- but women are the crazy ones for crying at a concert. \n\nEven like Booktok it\u2019s primarily women and they make fun of whatever they read you know men will be reading trashy books like Jordan Peterson, or pick up artists and recommending things like the art of war which clearly they haven\u2019t read because it\u2019s 90% logistics. Like first you judge people for not reading and then you judge them for reading what you don\u2019t consider worthy or make assumptions because they presented an aesthetic way it can\u2019t also be intellectual. \n\nIt\u2019s so interesting to me to see how everything women like is demonized or dismissed and men is uplifted. We don\u2019t think about domestic work at work, and I would add a huge amount to our GDP. It\u2019s always undervalued, and even things like programming used to be considered secretary work, and primarily for women, and once men got into it, and suddenly it was valued. Same thing happen with nursing or teaching- both had a lot of men and it was considered great but then once women got into it, it was devalued. I even noticed the pressure is so different on celebrities behind looks-  I noticed people are going after like Taylor, Swift and Selena Gomez to speak about Palestine and Israel conflict but some of the biggest people in terms of platform are like sports players, like Ronaldo and not one person has asked him - yet they\u2019re asking young women to get their opinion on conflicts that even most experts don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about.", "I think the real world is definitely on the whole more favorable towards men and while there have been improvements through history for equality it\u2019s still an uphill battle for women. \n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ve noticed that Reddit (not all of Reddit but popular spaces such as AITA, relationship advice, BORU) are more favorable towards women in judgements (as evidenced by the gender reversal comments and tests) to the extent that it almost feels like an overcorrection akin to how Barbie Land is.", "Along with the other examples, it\u2019s not always just opposite verdicts but charitable vs uncharitable interpretations towards a man vs woman\u2019s point of view on an issue.\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/cxnDt4Qfbt): male OP asks AITA for not telling a woman he was seeing he\u2019s a virgin until they were dating a while.

Popular verdict is he\u2019s NTA but maybe the woman is upset because she wanted to make his first time special OR that she doesn\u2019t want him to get attached and needs time to process her emotions.\n\n[Gender Swap](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/NORahBDhvW): Woman asks if she\u2019s the AH for not telling a guy she\u2019s a virgin.

The same way someone being racist towards a white person isn\u2019t going to be as bad as someone being racist towards a black people because there are systems already in place that contribute to that. a history, etc", "I have noticed this bias too and I am a woman, people are always asking more and more stuff from the man so they can somehow say he is the asshole, while for women made posts, it's gotta be real devil like for people to wholesale go that she is the asshole.\n\nthere's a lot of men bad, and sexism, misogyny angle added to every story here to make the man be the asshole", "Wow the responses are eye opening. \nSaving this for anyone who claims this never happens", "This is so concerning, I'm shocked.", "Yeah, I'm a woman, I identify as a feminist, and I generally tend to distrust men, and *even I* think that AITA comments are weirdly biased against men.", "I was about to link [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3vu3KEsp1L) I saw a while ago with examples that I thought was a perfect way to highlight this and realized you\u2019re the same commenter from back then!

Because even if there's a bunch of downvoted as shit people who are saying sexist things, you get shitty people everywhere, what matters is what voices the community prioritizes. Who gets upvoted and who gets downvoted?\n\nPersonally, I do think there are a few strong biases in the sub based on subject matter: Women who expect their male partners to pay for anything get dunked on hard, even if they're reasonable expectations like \"buy me a wedding ring I can wear forever instead of a ring pop\". Men will get interrogated about housework. MILs are the bad guy automatically. Someone being a cheater can justify literally any action taken against them.

Every post is a one sided account from an unreliable narrator. We have no way of knowing if one gender is more likely to post stories where they\u2019re blatantly in the right, or if one gender is more likely to honestly include important mitigating factors. We can\u2019t verify any of that information. \n\nIf during the time frame of posts used in a study one gender was repeatedly posting completely out of touch accounts where they were very rightfully told they are the asshole you could conclude people are \u201cbiased against them\u201d when in fact they\u2019ve just been legitimately the AH more often. \n\nThe only way a bias could be proven would be a study where they actually switched genders in posts to see if that changes people\u2019s reactions. \n\nAnd even then you have to consider \u201cunequal\u201d vs \u201cunfair\u201d. Like if people are responding more negatively to men getting physically aggressive with their partner, that might be a \u201cbias against men\u201d but it\u2019s because men can do a lot more damage to their partner when getting physical. There\u2019s a whole host of issues that don\u2019t impact different genders equally due to a gender unequal culture. Even just language used can have different impacts based on which gender it\u2019s being used against.

I think the point still stands about the author's data collection not being a good match for the problem of gender bias. \n\nThe author from that study's approach is a macro-level analysis of whether men or women are likely to get a top score AH rating. Generally, all posts have a top rating by default, whether the post gets 50 votes or 50K, and that doesn't take into account over what language is being used or the thinking behind the votes.\n\nTo explore bias, however, you would have to do a dive into how men/women are treated in a similar situations... what happens in cases of a partner not doing household chores or not working at a job, rather than just tabulating which way the top vote goes for all posts. This would not just involve the top score, but the number of votes, and the number of voters going against them. It would also explore the vehemence of language, the kinds of criticisms, rationales being used, the gender of the commentators, the fact that OPs receive public vs. private messages, etc. \n\nThe notion that men and women are equally likely to be voted an AH or not doesn't begin to answer all the particulars about how a decision is reached, who is reaching it, and why they're reaching it.", "Isn't Friends three of each but Seinfeld only has the one woman to three men?
