It\u2019s to the point where I break out in hives, get teary-eyed, and it gets harder to breathe. This has been a constant in my life so we cannot have cats. I tried going over once because I was told it was a hypoallergenic cat, despite not knowing the breed, I still had symptoms such as watery eyes and the air felt heavy.  \n My mom told me that the cat wasn\u2019t allowed anywhere around the house but just in my sister's room, but I still felt the air feel weird in there and didn't want to say anything while there because I wasn\u2019t sure if it was paranoia.   \nAfter the visit, I told my mom I would probably be visiting less because of the cat, I just feel uncomfortable there. My mom said that was unfair to her and my dad, but I couldn\u2019t risk being there and getting a worse reaction or a breakout in hives.  \n I don\u2019t want to be an asshole and make my sister get rid of the kitten her boyfriend got her, but now I feel unwelcome at my parent's house (which was also my childhood home). My mom doesn\u2019t want the cat there, but my dad doesn\u2019t mind.

It's not worth putting up with an alleric reaction.", "There are no hypoallergenic cats as people are allergic to different aspects. Same with dogs. You can be allergic to their fur or saliva etc. \n\nAllergy meds can help but not always enough to make it comfortable. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NAH for you staying away and for them getting a cat. If anything, they're AHs for only allowing the cat in one room of the house.", "if you've tried allergy pills and nothing works, absolutely NTA. i am also severely allergic to cats and all the deep cleaning and allergy pills in the world don't work for me. my niece really wants a cat, but i told her i won't be able to come to her house if she got one. it's sad, but it's true. you can't just \"tough out\" something that makes you itchy and feel like you're trying to breathe through a napkin.", "NAH. You don't live there, The people who live there all the time want to have a pet and it is unreasonable to think that people shouldn't do things they enjoy (including having a pet) only for visitors. However, they already knew that you are allergic, so they had to know that was going to happen. You are not the asshole for decreasing your visits to their house, but they are not ones either for wanting to keep the cat. Maybe a compromise can be reached and you all can meet in another member of the family's house or in a third place (restaurant, caf\u00e9, etc.). But you will definitely be the asshole if you push them into getting rid of the cat. Not your decision. It would be different if you were living there, but you are not, so as a mere visitor, you can decide if you want to go or not, or tell them your meetings have to be elsewhere or you wouldn't go, but you shouldn't push them to get rid to the cat if they don't want to. So I think you all are firmly in NAH territory,, but they will be if they pressure you to go to their house despite your allergy and you will be one if you push them to get rid of the cat. Reach a compromise that work out for all of you.", "I think both sides were equally unreasonable but have not yet risen to the level of AH so NAH. \n\nThey can have a cat now that you've moved out. It sucks and is unfortunate for you, but they could possibly have waited decades to have this pet and are finally able to. You also should not have said that your sister has to get rid of the cat.\n\nThe flip side though is you can't visit and they made that choice to exclude you. You are right to set the boundary that you can't go over there. You have a medical reason and are not being difficult or selfish. It was wrong of your mom to say you're being unfair. It's nice that she wants you to experience a bad medical even or extreme discomfort just so you can come over. \n\nI am probably pessimistic but I expect this to escalate to them guilting you and getting mad that you can't visit for the holidays. Then it will be N T A.", "NAH\n\nJust explain to your parents that you're not saying you'll never see them ever again. Simply that you can't visit their home where the cat lives. You can all still get together and eat at restaurants instead. That's a reasonable compromise.", "NAH. You can\u2019t be around the cat. It\u2019s not reasonable for them to expect that. However, it\u2019s also not reasonable for you to expect them to never have a pet that your sister has probably wanted for years.\n\nI have family members who are allergic to my pets. We see them at restaurants or plan outdoor outings. It can be done. I\u2019m an adult and I\u2019m not going to not have pets because there are allergies in what is now my extended rather than immediate family. If everyone is a little bit flexible, it can work.", "NAH. Invite your mom, dad, and sister over for visits at your place, or at restaurants, etc.", "NAH.  Considering it would not be a daily exposure kind of thing and only when you\u2019re visiting, just take an allergy pill.  We have a friend who is allergic to dogs that comes over weekly for gatherings.  We ran it past him first and got a hypoallergenic dog, but he agreed it would be no big deal to pop an allergy pill once a week.  They come in non drowsy version, I use them more frequently than weekly myself for seasonal allergies.  Maybe it wasn\u2019t the most considerate thing in the world but they also did wait until you moved out and chose a hypoallergenic breed.  \n\nYou should also ask that they stay on top of vacuuming and air filter changes that helps a lot.  It will be a whole lot more humane and easier for you to just pop a pill than it would be to rehome a kitten.", "NTA. I don't think your family is either though. If they don't have any severe allergies themselves, it sounds like they may have a misconception of the reactions. Minimal exposure, i.e. a visit, is not equivalent to minimal reactions. They might not get that. If you are so allergic to cats that you can't breathe, you're right to not want to put yourself in that position. Talk to your parents about options for the holidays. \n\nThis is assuming you've gone over options before with your doctor. If you're not on allergy medicine or haven't talked to your doctor about options, that would be a next step if you can. It's better to check all options is all.  Good luck OP.", "NTA.

My eyes would swell shut, I'd be sneezing and I would be choking in about twenty minutes, maybe less.\n\nIt's always hilarious when someone suggests I take an allergy pill, like that wasn't the first thing I did.

I don't feel safe in a home with a cat.\" BECAUSE if they're not willing to do that, it'll be easier to find the kitten another home when they're small.

Silly question, really.\n\nBut I know that Zyrtec is outdated, and the new pill with the same active ingredient is called Xyzal. Less side effects. In fact, you don't seem to realise that not every allergy pill will work for you. Some active ingredients simply don't work for someone, like Allegra does eff-all for me, so just randomly spouting an old medicine's name like it's a surefire way to stop allergies is pretty damn silly.\n\nThe reason you do not know the above is because you know very little about allergies.\n\nAgain, I have a strong allergy. To many things. Have had allergies since I was a baby. I mostly grew out of my asthma. I have had to get checkups and checkups and been in some researches, too. So I know a little bit more about allergies than someone who doesn't even seem to know that Zyrtec itself is not a cure-all. Or how allergies can become more serious after each exposure.\n\nYou can argue with me till you're blue in the face, but that won't make you right."]}
