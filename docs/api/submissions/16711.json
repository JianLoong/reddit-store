I live alone with my dog, and he lives with his mum who hates dogs. He\u2019ll regularly spend the night at mine, averaging at about 3-4 nights a week, and because of my dog I never spend the night at his, since I live alone there would be no one to take her outside to pee late at night or early in the morning. Also, as mentioned his mum HATES dogs so I can\u2019t bring her with me either. \n\nRecently he\u2019s started to complain about having to put in all the effort and drive to see me when I never go to him. Which isn\u2019t completely true because I do still regularly drive to go see him, I just won\u2019t stay for longer than like 5 hours. \n\nHe\u2019s suggested that he should just move in so a) there\u2019s no more driving back and forth, b) he won\u2019t have to pay rent at his mums anymore and would be able to save and take us on a nice holiday (I inherited my place so he wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent here either) and c) he could help with some bills so it\u2019ll benefit me too. \n\nI said no, because honestly although I do love him I feel like it\u2019s just a bit early and I want to enjoy having my own space for a bit longer. Which admittedly does sound a bit selfish but i don\u2019t think i\u2019m ready to live with someone and move my things around for theirs. He got annoyed at me that i\u2019m not willing to compromise by either spending some time at his or letting him move in. \n\nOn one hand I can kinda see how i\u2019m being unreasonable but also feel that I don\u2019t really have a choice with my dog and she\u2019ll always be my first priority. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I feel like I should give more context based on some of the replies i\u2019ve gotten. I didn\u2019t think these were needed when I was originally writing this, but I feel like it would clear up peoples concerns for a less bias answer \n\n1) He hasn\u2019t always lived with his mum, she was really unwell about a year ago so he moved back in with her at the time to look after her \n\n2) He does already help around my house with chores and stuff, he\u2019s very tidy \n\n3) He\u2019s not a mooch, he pays for groceries if he\u2019s cooking dinner that night, and if we go out for food he always pays as he\u2019s very traditional in that sense (no matter how much I try to pay lol)", "created_utc": 1683561997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bwfsn/aita_for_refusing_to_compromise_with_my_boyfriend/", "score": 355, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Assuming you don't have a mortgage, figure out what a monthly mortgage payment would be on your home if you had a 30 year fixed rate, and he should be paying you half of that at least.

I dated my current bf for a year and was ready to start my life with him. It feels so right with him. I was ready.\n\nWhat matters the most here is you.\n\nWhen YOU are ready.

You need to make sure you are the one letting him move in or the relationship will sour.", "NTA - whether he is a mooch or not, 4 months is very fast. I would absolutely advocate for waiting before moving in together. To my mind, it takes a few months to transition from dating to being \"in a relationship\" and it's only then that people start to let their guard down and let you see who they are. \n\nI know others have raised concern about the age difference. In itself its not necessarily bad, but age can be a factor in where people are in life and what they want from a relationship, so it's worth evaluating if you are really on the same page or not if this is something he is pushing for.", "NTA. I'm also dating a dog owner, I am the one who lives with my mom and we have a cat, that is not used to dogs at home. I live 1h away and I don't have a problem comuting.

Yes for some people it isn't but I would only move in with someone after being together with them for at least 1year.", "NTA. And you're right, 4 months is early for such a big step.\n\nHe should've stopped asking when you said no. Him being annoyed at you \"not compromising\" sounds a bit childish.
