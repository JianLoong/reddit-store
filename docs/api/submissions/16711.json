I live alone with my dog, and he lives with his mum who hates dogs. He\u2019ll regularly spend the night at mine, averaging at about 3-4 nights a week, and because of my dog I never spend the night at his, since I live alone there would be no one to take her outside to pee late at night or early in the morning. Also, as mentioned his mum HATES dogs so I can\u2019t bring her with me either. \n\nRecently he\u2019s started to complain about having to put in all the effort and drive to see me when I never go to him. Which isn\u2019t completely true because I do still regularly drive to go see him, I just won\u2019t stay for longer than like 5 hours. \n\nHe\u2019s suggested that he should just move in so a) there\u2019s no more driving back and forth, b) he won\u2019t have to pay rent at his mums anymore and would be able to save and take us on a nice holiday (I inherited my place so he wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent here either) and c) he could help with some bills so it\u2019ll benefit me too. \n\nI said no, because honestly although I do love him I feel like it\u2019s just a bit early and I want to enjoy having my own space for a bit longer. Which admittedly does sound a bit selfish but i don\u2019t think i\u2019m ready to live with someone and move my things around for theirs. He got annoyed at me that i\u2019m not willing to compromise by either spending some time at his or letting him move in. \n\nOn one hand I can kinda see how i\u2019m being unreasonable but also feel that I don\u2019t really have a choice with my dog and she\u2019ll always be my first priority. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I feel like I should give more context based on some of the replies i\u2019ve gotten. I didn\u2019t think these were needed when I was originally writing this, but I feel like it would clear up peoples concerns for a less bias answer \n\n1) He hasn\u2019t always lived with his mum, she was really unwell about a year ago so he moved back in with her at the time to look after her \n\n2) He does already help around my house with chores and stuff, he\u2019s very tidy \n\n3) He\u2019s not a mooch, he pays for groceries if he\u2019s cooking dinner that night, and if we go out for food he always pays as he\u2019s very traditional in that sense (no matter how much I try to pay lol)", "created_utc": 1683561997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bwfsn/aita_for_refusing_to_compromise_with_my_boyfriend/", "score": 710, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Assuming you don't have a mortgage, figure out what a monthly mortgage payment would be on your home if you had a 30 year fixed rate, and he should be paying you half of that at least.

This was a farm and he owned it outright in his own name but he had to give her half which meant that the poor guy lost his farm (couldn't afford it afterwards).

He wasn't the most educated man and didn't fight it either because his lawyer told him that he would lose and to just give her the half that she was asking for.\n\nIf you do have him move in, check the law in your state or province.

In the edit, he\u2019s not a mooch, but he says he can stop paying his mom rent and then take you guys on a vacation to make up for the fact he won\u2019t be paying you rent?!?!? Age gap-ewwww. Why are you dating a walking, red, flag. NTA but Y T A to yourself of you keep dating this guy", "NTA. You simply aren't ready for that step, and that is totally okay.", "NTA - this man needs to get his own place, not move into yours. You have only been dating for 4 months, it\u2019s is a huge marinara flag \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9that he wants to move in with you so fast. He is complaining about a 40 min drive to see you? That\u2019s bs. And sad to say but this 31 year old man is dating a 22 year old because he knows that a woman his own age would tell him to take a hike and not even entertain the idea of having him move in.", "NTA it is never a good idea to cohabitation based solely on convenience.", "NTA but this relationship has so many red flags just in the first paragraph you typed.", "I'd stick to your guns on this. 4 months is very early, and his strong sense of being ill-used because you won't let him in when y'all have known each other basically a few weeks is not a good sign.", "NTA. This guy is too old and \"un-launched\" (as in Failure To) for you.", "NAH. This is an issue of communication, not an asshole matter. I can perfectly understand your reasoning, but I can also understand why he would feel this is not equal.", "Please really try to look at some things from an outside perspective on this OP. And really think about if this relationship is what you want or just what is there at the moment. 4 months is fast to have this guy move in. Even more so because of the situation he is in. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind he has at least part of the reasoning as a way to get out of his Moms. And honestly if he\u2019s already there 3/4 nights a week then how is he being that inconvenienced? Does he still need to go to his moms for some reason or another those days. Does he work? Please be really careful letting someone into a home you own. You have no idea how the relationship can change being in a situation living together. I feel like honestly you are heading towards sort of the test of that by having him there already those days, I\u2019d just keep it like that and see how that goes, maybe gradually he will be there all the time anyways, the feeling he is forcing that is concerning, as well as the no rent. If you let him move in. And say a month or year or whatever from now you don\u2019t want to be with him that can easily turn into a really ugly situation. Stand your ground on this, and don\u2019t let them change your mind.", "NTA--that little voice in your head, telling you that it's too soon--that you aren't ready to move your things around to accomodate him--it's there for a reason. The biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life-have always happened when I ignored that voice in my head. \n\n4 months is not a long time to drive that --especially since you both do some driving---- only you don't stay overnight there (due to his mother). \n\nIt seems more about him wanting to be out of his mother's home, but he could easily get his own place until the both of you decide you are ready together. (or he can keep living with his mom)\n\nYou are handling this with maturity and a level head....NTA", "Since this looks to be one of the top comments, I'm putting it here. OP, if there is even a snowball's chance in hell that he could have copied your key or has a copy already, change your locks. If he has a copy, he could try to move in while you are out. \n\nAlso, WATCH YOUR MAIL. If he starts having his mail sent to your place, he could use it to claim tenant's rights. Like others are saying, stand firm. This is way too soon for him to be looking to move in. Don't let him move in. The eviction process is a long pain in the rear that will cost you time, money, and stress.", "All of this\u2026 Girl run! He wants to move in with you so he doesn\u2019t have to pay rent? First it\u2019s way too soon. He sees you as an opportunity. I would also let him know without any doubt if you did allow him to move him he would be splitting utilities and paying some sort of rent that would go toward the taxes etc. This is a massive red flag, no it\u2019s like a red torpedo.", "And after 4 months?!?!  This guy could be an age appropriate millionaire and spend his time reaching people from burning buildings and hand-feeding orphaned kittens, and I would say 4 months is too soon. I\u2019m 42, and 4 months is too soon. \n\nThe rest of it makes it clear that this is a BAD IDEA, but anytime some is pressuring you to take big steps 4 months into a relationship - much less not taking No for an answer - is a sign to pull way back and reassess.", "the middle point is strange, it's not like people don't still have to pay rent at their place if they stay at yours, and it would be really weird to charge someone you're inviting over for staying.", "Yes \ud83d\ude4c I read the ages and knew where this is going. She can do so much better and he will only hold her back. Fly girl, fly!!!!", "This guy is a sophisticated combination of love bombing and exploitive. OP is not going to see this (judging based on her edit) because she's simply too young and inexperienced.\n\nThis guy is sitting off huge red flags from miles away from most of us but OP is editing that he's not mooch because he moved in with his mom to \"help her\" but somehow also needs to pay rent for the privilege of helping her. Of course when OP asks, he's going to come up with some squirrely explanation that makes him look like the good guy and she's going to gobble it right up. From what the OP is describing he's nothing but squirrely explanations so far and it's not been a deal breaker so far.\n\nYou're right, under no circumstances should a younger woman allow a man almost a decade older than her pressure her to move into the home she owns after dating for a grand total of 4 months. This is just absurdly obvious love bombing with a side of guilt.\n\nThe fact that he's already guilt tripping her and claiming things aren't fair, likely because he sees free rent in his future is a huge red flag. OP is foolish to think he's just some nice tidy guy who very traditional about paying for dates. He wants the younger girlfriend with the free housing and he'll manipulate her pretty hard to get that.\n\nOP is NTA for pumping the breaks but she does need to pay attention to how he handles this no.", "Yes! Die on this hill. You don\u2019t owe him housing, especially at the cost of living the life YOU want.", "Ngl, everyone shitting on this guy for living at home at 31 when I'm living at home at 27 hurts lmao.", "yes he has steady employment, has a great 9-5 job, and no never been married or had kids", "Yees!\n\nI made the terrible mistake of saying yes to an ex that asked to move in with me after only a few months of dating, because I was younger and stupid and thought \"well, you know, that's what people do in relationships, gotta do it I guess\", instead of listening to my gut instinct.\n\nTurns out he didn't ask to move in because he loved me or anything. It's cuz he paid no rent or bills for all the prior months he spent almost exclusively at my place anyway, might as well prolong it. And because I had a few guys as flatmates he liked to hang with.\n\nA paid for house, cooking, cleaning and sex all served on a platter by yours truly, and a gaggle of bros to play video games with, all under the same roof? Heaven on earth for him.\n\nJesus, how could I have been such a moron \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree.  It's not like he said \"let's find a place together\" or \"I'm moving to a new place and would love you to move in with me.\"", "Oh no no no, he won't lose his job, he'll drive 40 minutes each way the other way EVERY DAY, that's much less hassle than driving 40 minutes to see his girlfriend 3-4 times a week. /s\n\nAssuming he has a job...", "Right! And OP if you ever ( and i truly hope you DO NOT) let this dude move in, charge him rent. Just bcuz you own your own home doesn\u2019t mean he gets to live rent free. You still have to pay upkeep and taxes.", "Hopping on the bandwagon, NTA OP, the guy is just using you because you're 22 and a new adult, he isn't. I've seen this situation before and I'm seeing so many red flags it's a forking circus. DUMP HIM!", "And he\u2019s already convincing you that \u201ccompromising\u201d = doing whatever he wants you to do without any regard to your feelings, goals, or preferences. NTA, and I hope OP is able to see the red flags and take things very slow with this guy before making any serious commitments.", "Fucking hell. Assumption really is the mother of all fuck ups. Don't be so judgmental when you haven't been given that information.", "I have better things to waste 20 bucks on", "I love posts like these where you can tell they've never lived anywhere rural. 40 minutes is like the minimum it takes me to get to any good stores lol", "# BLOOD RED FLAGS", "He should pay some kind of rent toward taxes, upkeep, etc. After all he would be living there and using everything. It isn\u2019t his house, so she is his landlord.", "That\u2019s very a convenient reason. I guarantee you he is lying. Bet if you tell him you he has to get his own place before you consider moving him in that his mom has another episode and needs him to stay. \n\nWhat if they get in a big fight he gets kicked out and shows up at your door? Its just until he can save for his own place after all. /s\n\nIt\u2019s true no woman his age would touch him with a 10ft pole- I\u2019m 30. Stories like his are major red flags. Why is he paying her rent if he moved in to help her? If she needed the cash then but doesn\u2019t now what changed? Oh yet another thing you can\u2019t politely confirm with his mother either. How convenient", "So he's going to keep driving 40 minutes each way to that good job every single work day but was complaining about driving out to spend a few days with you, right? Just no. At the risk of triggering your romeo and juliet complex, he's not your one.", "You are the EXCEPTION, not the rule. I doubt a man who is able to drive to her house 40 minutes one way several times a week is disabled.", "I guarantee you he is lying. Bet if you tell him you he has to get his own place before you consider moving him in that his mom has another episode and needs him to stay.", "She might not be able to afford her own home payments without his support /shrug", "While I agree that this guy seems shady as hell...It's possible that she had major surgery or an injury or something like that that kept her off her feet and unable to work for a few months. So him moving in to look after her and pay rent to help her stay on top of her bills during that time would make sense. Guy still gives me the heeby jeebies though", "Exactly! I would also suggest that with your next boyfriend (cuz the current one has enough red flags to front an amusement park), don't tell them right away that you own your own home outright; it''s an invitation to moochers like this.", "The thing is, he stays multiple nights a week, so he\u2019s not going back and fourth every night", "it's kind of weird that he moved to help the mum and she now charges him rent. Either mum is a complete AH or something doesn't add up.", "Or he says that to not look like a moocher.", "Definitely lying. NTA OP. This guy is a loser.", "\u201cHe could help with some bills so it would benefit me too\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent because I inherited the house\u201d\n\nThese were agreed upon statements so what are you even arguing about? He already agreed to help out. She already made a choice he wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent specifically", "That wasn't what I was talking about, just pointing out how quick people are to call people losers when they live at home. Not arguing that this dude isn't a loser cause I agree that OP is NTA and he's a goof. So save your breath", "And I agree with most people here, OP is NTA and he sounds like a total goof, but that wasn't the point I was after.", "I can drive up to 2 hours before my back has issues, and walk roughly 15-18 kms per day most days of the week. Still have lots of limitations and issues, but disabled people can fucking drive lol and I wasn't saying this dude was, just saying people are super quick to jump to conclusions based on really nothing.", "True, but then why would he need to move in with his GF (and stop paying rent). Wouldn\u2019t he move out to something like he had before if the move was temporary? Or why would he be moving out if mom still needs the help? \n\nThere are plenty of other reasons he could have moved in and paid rent that aren\u2019t red flags, but with everything else it\u2019s adding up to no from me.", "Excellent point.", "He could absolutely be lying about why he moved in with his mom.", "If she no longer needs care, he can look for his own place. Funny how he\u2019s only considering moving out now that he thinks \u201cfree\u201d is an option.", "[removed]", "but did she charge you rent when you were living with her? It's such a weird situation.", "How dare you tell AITA people to not automatically write their own conclusion and story behind a strangers issue!!!! They obviously know better than the person actually typing it!!! (/s if that wasn't clear enough)", "Bot"]}
