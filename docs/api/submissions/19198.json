It is too early to see big results, so of course the dog is still shaking its head.\n3. If the room mate wanted the dog treated immediately, then he should have skipped work and taken his own dog to the vet.\n4.

Your friend needs to take this more seriously. Also - it\u2019s very important the course of antibiotics is followed and completed once commenced, the bacteria can become resistant otherwise. Dogs can lose full or partial hearing if ear infections aren\u2019t dealt with. Not your responsibility, of course, but the dog gods will look favourably upon you if you advocate for this dog that seems to need an advocate.", "NTA - the dog isn\u2019t yours to care for.

Not to mention paying the bill. If your roommate was concerned enough he could\u2019ve called off.
