In any event, it sounds like the question of the OP doing the first treatment wasn't even raised until after the roommate started reaming him out for it. At that point, wouldn't it be reasonable to think that the roommate would be in a position to do it himself?

OP simply declined to do something they had no reason to believe was expected of them (and might reasonably have inferred the roommate would take care of).

And your friend should of did research on the product they were buying beforehand. I always do even if i know the answer already i double check too, so i knew the ear solution was safe. Clearly OP's roommate trusts op enough to take his dog somewhere and not just that also to be able to live together. Therefore im sure he trusted him with the ear solution. And im also sure if it was any other health issue more severe i mean, im sure OP's roommare would of called in sick to be the one to care for his dog. As i would. Ear infections arent life threatening and neither is the medicine to clear it up. Anything else i would of not trusted anyone with it. But we are talking about an ear infection. Something i work with quite frequently for one of our furbabies.", "NTA.  You did your roommate a big favor", "Absolutely NTA, ears are delicate areas for many dogs and they don't like being handled there.  My dog will very begrudgingly let me handle her ears if they're bothering her, but I would not recommend risking it to anyone else.  Touching animals in delicate areas if they don't completely trust you is a great way to get bitten.  You should not be treating the dog, they should be treating their dog because it's safer for them to treat them.  Never treat an animal for anything if they don't belong to you."]}
