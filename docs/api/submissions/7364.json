{"id": 7364, "submission_id": "10c5eep", "title": "WIBTA if my engagement ring had my sister\u2019s birthstone in it?", "selftext": "My partner (34M) and I (32F) have been together for 2.5 years and are planning on getting engaged soon. I don\u2019t know when/where he\u2019ll pop the question, but sometime in 2023. He\u2019s been very upfront that he wants me to have as much input as possible on my engagement ring, and we\u2019re working with a company that designs/makes custom rings. \n\nHere\u2019s where my dilemma comes in: I\u2019ve never wanted a diamond ring. (I understand the classic appeal, and diamonds are gorgeous, it\u2019s just not for me!) Instead I want a sapphire ring. Blue is one of my favorite colors, and I have bright blue eyes. My partner also says that my eyes are what he noticed first about me and he regularly tells me how much he loves them. Whenever I imagine my wedding day, I\u2019m wearing a sapphire ring. \n\nWhen we were visiting my family for the holidays, my mom asked about the ring, and I told her that we were still working on a design, but that it\u2019d be a sapphire. My older sister (35F) overheard this and lost it. Sapphire is her birthstone, and throughout our childhoods, we always got color-coordinated stuff. Blue for her, red for me (garnet is my birthstone). Like if we got sweaters, mine would be red and hers would be blue. I\u2019ve never really liked red, but that\u2019s just the way it was.\n\nMy sister said that she couldn\u2019t believe that I was considering a sapphire ring, when I knew it was HER birthstone. She told me I was pathetic and attention-seeking for getting a non-diamond ring, and that I should know that blue is her color. She said that everyone in the family will think it\u2019s weird and inappropriate for my engagement ring to have her birthstone. \n\nFor some extra info, my sister doesn\u2019t wear sapphire jewelry with any regularity and she got married four years ago. Her engagement ring and wedding band both have diamonds, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m \u201cstealing\u201d sapphires or a ring idea from her. \n\nWIBTA for going with my original/dream ring, even if it pisses off my sister?\n\nTLDR: I want a sapphire engagement ring. Older sister says that because it\u2019s her birthstone, I can\u2019t.\n\nETA: Lots of people commenting/asking if my sister hates on other people having sapphire jewelry. Nope! Not that I know of. I think it\u2019s just *my* ring that\u2019s the problem. Also, I know that this is a minor issue and seemed like a no-brainer to me. My sister and I don\u2019t have the best relationship, and her vehemence really got in my head a bit, hence my post.", "created_utc": 1673742331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10c5eep/wibta_if_my_engagement_ring_had_my_sisters/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That happens to be a sapphire.  So be it.  \n\nShe\u2019ll be sad to know other women wear sapphire jewellery as well.\n\nIf you have kids, do not share planned baby names with her.\n\nNTA.
