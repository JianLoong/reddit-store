She asked your opinion. Her Kree-AY-tiV spelling of names makes me roll my eyes, and you didn't volunteer your thoughts on the matter, but if she's one of those people who think children can't be Ewe-NEEkque unless they have an unusual name, I don't think anything you say will deter her.", "NTA - she asked your opinion, you delivered.  This is the epitome of FAFO.", "NTA. Sounds like she and your MIL+BIL hate the children before they\u2019re even born. I will never understand why people reproduce just to torture their children under the guise of \u201cbeing unique\u201d", "NTA. She ASKED your opinion and you gave it. Kids are cruel so when her kids come home because other kids made fun of their names, she might be envious of that \"basic\" name.", "NTA. She opened the door when she started criticizing your baby names. And it's not the uniqueness of the name, but the spelling. They are going to have to correct/clarify every time someone reads their name, like on the first day of school, or at the doctor's office, or anytime they have to give their name for verification. \"Yes pickup for Braylin, it spelled Baryleen...No, L-**E-E**.\"", "NTA, she brought a knife to a gun fight, and boy did you have ammunition with the names she chose. Those poor kids. Also James is a great name btw.", "NTA.\n\nShe asked. Next time someone has the nerve to complain, ask them why they would want you to lie? Are they dishonest themselves? Tell them you're really not comfortable with them, they most likely aren't very ethical people.", "20\u2026 30 years from now, there will be corporate, HR directors confused because they won\u2019t know which resumes to throw out.\n\n(drum rimshot)\n\nI kid. I kid.\n\nUmmmm\u2026 NTA, OP. \nThem poor kids, gilko biloba, alkaline water, 8675309 and bilbo baggins.", "NTA. Once she started giving you shit about naming your son something \u201cbasic\u201d she opened the door wide for you to express your opinion on the ridiculous names she\u2019s chosen for her own children.", "[removed]", "NTA lol. She asked for your opinion BUT also called your choice basic so it's tied!", "NTA. Enough Redditors have stated why, but I want to know - how is she pronouncing Astra, Inky, and Lore? Because it surely can\u2019t be the way they\u2019re spelled.", "The only reason I'm going with NTA is that she asked your opinion and expected to be able to criticise your choices without you doing the same to her", "NTA. That sounds like those fcked up families you see on TV with 10 kids and all having stupid names. Adding vegan and no electronics I'd say prime TV lol\n\nYou could have just said you like none of these names and let it be. But her raging about you going to give your son a boring (normal?!?!?! TYVM) name was worth what you said. The BIL and MIL can rage whatever they want, the names suck and if she didn't want an opinion on kids naming, she shouldn't have asked, no matter if she asked for specific names or not.", "NTA.  \n\nDon't apologize or turn it into \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.\" \n\nInfo:. Do they parents in this family have crunchy names?  Are they a Zelda and Isialdor or a Mark and Mary?", "She asked, you gave your honest answer. She's TA, not you.", "NTA. Selfish people forget that they are not naming cute little babies but actual people who will one day apply for jobs, introduce themselves in formal settings, have to spell their name to others, sit in dread while attendance is taken, etc. Your response to her was spot on and hilarious, too.", "Well, it is true.  The kids are going to get frustrated over the years continually correcting people on how to spell and pronounce their names.  It will be a bother with teachers in the younger grades because the kids will get confused signals.  \n\nThen again, my husband has a perfectly \"normal\" common name with two alternate spellings.  He had two teachers that argued with him that his name was actually a different common name that started with the same letter.  Another told him that he didn't know how to spell his name.  And those are just the ones I heard about decades later!  (so, think \"Geoffrey\" and teachers wanting to call him \"Gregory\" or \"Godfrey\" or insisted his name was \"Jeffrey\").    My name us a single syllable and 4 letters and you have no idea how many times that has been messed up.   And then there was poor Stephen in my 4th grade class--we had a sub who would always humiliate him about how it must either be spelled \"Steven\" or pronounced \"Stefan\" and either way his name was wrong.  \n\nSo, yeah, I think SIL's naming choices are stupid.  But they are her kids so you don't really get to have a say.    By the same token, she doesn't get a say in what you name yours.   So if she wants to go on a rant about her opinion of your name choice, then she resigns all rights to avoid hearing your opinion on hers.  \n\nNTA.  Since she went on a rant about your name choice first.  \n\nBut really, just let it go.  You aren't going to change her mind.  And if she tries to change yours again, the tell her that she can STFU unless she wants to hear your opinion on her choices again.", "NTA. I would have reacted the same. She should name her kid Astra. Would be funny, in Germany this is the name of an older (lame) car called Opel Astra and the name of a bigger beer company. And I am sorry for everyone who have to write down als these creative names (sounds like x but is written like y). Wishing you all the best for baby James!", "NTA\n\nI'm just a little tempted to say E S H because you weren't doing this to help her kids at all. if your motivations were the kids feelings you would have spoken up before they were born. You just wanted to get back at your sister, which, in this case, seems like she absolutely deserved it. So NTA because your sister has apparently been playing stupid games (mom shaming you) and finally got the stupid prize she deserved.\n\neta: clarification, yes, OP says that sister only asked about current baby name, but sister apparently also went off on a rant about OP's overall naming choices, which imo, opens sister up to OP clapping back about all of sister's naming choices.", "NTA \n\nShe asked your opinion, she got it.", "She ASKED YOUR OPINION, then insulted you and your husband when she went on about your 'basic' name choice. She opened her self up to your opinions with that.\n\nTheres a saying **Don't ask questions you won't like the answer to.**\n\nAt the very least Kelvin and Rorai can go by their names and just change the spelling of it to the normal versions.\n\nNGL, quite like Astra. But Lore & Inky? No. These kids will grow into adults that have to apply for jobs etc. Its ok having a unusual name, along as SIL is willing to accept their uniqueness might actually hold them back or they'll change it.\n\nNTA", "NTA- don't ask if you can't handle the answer", "NTA. SIL shouldn't dish it out if she can't take it.", "It's people like SIL, OP, that are the reason the human race will implode terribly!  \n\n\nSome of these weird names I see recently should be classed as abuse. Imagine having to deal with bullies AND (or due to) a godawful name.  \n\n\nNTA.", "ESH - She doesn\u2019t have a right to tell you how to name your kids. You don\u2019t have a right to tell her how to name her kids.\n\nHer kids might grow to hate their names. Or they might love them. Your kid might love his name. Or he might grow to hate it. Neither of you can possibly know how yours kids will feel when they\u2019re older because their opinions and personality will constantly change and shift as they grow into their own people.\n\nYou both have different parenting styles. Big whoop. As long as the kids are happy, healthy, and cared for, that\u2019s all that matters.", "\" My Husband agrees with me that someone needed to tell her she's giving these kids ridiculous names.\"\n\nAgreed.  NTA.  Don't apologize.  At the end of the day, this is your husband's family.  He can deal with it if it needs dealing with.", "ESH\n\nYeah the names are ridiculous, but what you said was still rude, just the same how it was rude of her to call your name basic.", "ESH. She asked about 3 specific names, not your worldview on child naming (even if I agree with you). \n\nCorrect approach, pick the least offensive one: \"Hm, of the three, I like Astra. It's pretty and versatile!\"", "ESH\n\nFor fuck's sake stay out of each other's parenting decisions. Both of you need to learn when NOT to open your mouth.", "ESH - Her kids names are unusual but not too the extent they're likely to cause life problems. You were lashing out because she was being nasty about your future baby's name. You're both partially in the wrong and neither of you should be mom-shaming the other.", "SIL asked your opinion on specific names and insulted your impending child\u2019s name in the process. You then went off about her other children\u2019s names and insulted her parenting choices. You both sound ridiculous.\n\nESH.", "NTA tell SIL, BIL & MIL if stupid people ask a stupid question expect an honest question. Honestly what the hell is your SIL smoking with names like that, the kids are going to be bullied mercilessly through school because of them.", "ESH.  Grew up with a name no one can spell and still hate it.  Her kids, her names.  She isn't going to change them because you don't like them so you are wasting your breath and causing family drama.  The kids can change them when they get older if they want as it is too late already for three of them.  She is for, \"She also went on a rant about how my husband and I's baby is going to have a basic name and not be memorable....\"  If the only reason a kid is memorable is their name, well then, good luck to them in their life.", "ESH\n\nInfo\nWhat did you hope to accomplish by telling her this? Did you think she was going to rush to the courthouse and change all of her children\u2019s names? Probably not. So you just said it to hurt her and insult her children.", "ESH\n\nYour SIL thinks it's funny and cute and special to give her kids names no one will pronounce correctly on the first try and make filling out forms a nightmare. You have the correct take on this. She was being rude by calling your future baby's name \"basic.\"\n\nHowever, for the sake of peace you shouldn't have retaliated by bringing up her bad choices.

You are 100% right on.  Those kids are going to HATE their names and will probably change them at the first opportunity.  She thinks she's being oh-so-clever, but in reality, she's just making life harder for the kids.  Somebody needs to tell her so, and you did.  I don't think any apology is necessary.  Ignore criticism and eventually, it will go away.  Hopefully.", "NTA \n\nTHOSE NAMES ARE NIGHTMARES", "ESH\n\nYour response made you the AH.
