The kids are going to get frustrated over the years continually correcting people on how to spell and pronounce their names.  It will be a bother with teachers in the younger grades because the kids will get confused signals.  \n\nThen again, my husband has a perfectly \"normal\" common name with two alternate spellings.  He had two teachers that argued with him that his name was actually a different common name that started with the same letter.  Another told him that he didn't know how to spell his name.  And those are just the ones I heard about decades later!  (so, think \"Geoffrey\" and teachers wanting to call him \"Gregory\" or \"Godfrey\" or insisted his name was \"Jeffrey\").    My name us a single syllable and 4 letters and you have no idea how many times that has been messed up.   And then there was poor Stephen in my 4th grade class--we had a sub who would always humiliate him about how it must either be spelled \"Steven\" or pronounced \"Stefan\" and either way his name was wrong.  \n\nSo, yeah, I think SIL's naming choices are stupid.  But they are her kids so you don't really get to have a say.    By the same token, she doesn't get a say in what you name yours.

I accidentally did the same thing to my oldest, and they ended up sharing a classroom with another girl of the same name, and the other child had the firs three letters of their last name in common with my child.  Then I gave my youngest a name that unfortunately has about 12 spellings.  My niece and a friend's child ended up with those youneek names, and they and their parents are constantly having difficulty with people not being able to spell it, pronounce it, and they never find anything with their name without having it custom made for bigger $$.
