The kids are going to get frustrated over the years continually correcting people on how to spell and pronounce their names.  It will be a bother with teachers in the younger grades because the kids will get confused signals.  \n\nThen again, my husband has a perfectly \"normal\" common name with two alternate spellings.  He had two teachers that argued with him that his name was actually a different common name that started with the same letter.  Another told him that he didn't know how to spell his name.  And those are just the ones I heard about decades later!  (so, think \"Geoffrey\" and teachers wanting to call him \"Gregory\" or \"Godfrey\" or insisted his name was \"Jeffrey\").    My name us a single syllable and 4 letters and you have no idea how many times that has been messed up.   And then there was poor Stephen in my 4th grade class--we had a sub who would always humiliate him about how it must either be spelled \"Steven\" or pronounced \"Stefan\" and either way his name was wrong.  \n\nSo, yeah, I think SIL's naming choices are stupid.  But they are her kids so you don't really get to have a say.    By the same token, she doesn't get a say in what you name yours.
