My husband and I have been trying to have a baby. We finally got pregnant and we\u2019re so excited. We had planned to tell my parents and his family on thanksgiving since my parents live far away and would be in town. His parents are divorced and don\u2019t get along and we would be telling his father separately. \nUnfortunately my dad broke his ankle and had surgery a few days before thanksgiving so my parents couldn\u2019t make it. My husband and I decided to just do thanksgiving with his family.\nThe first thing that happened was his mom trying to force alcohol down my throat as soon as I walked in the door. I pushed it off with a laugh that I hadn\u2019t eaten all day and might have one with dinner. She didn\u2019t know I was pregnant yet.\nHis family was sitting around the table and we were talking about work and catching up on life events when our of nowhere my MIL says \u201cmaybe your parents didn\u2019t come this year because your dads beating your mom\u201d me\u201dwhat?\u201d She shrugged \u201cmaybe your dads really beating your mom and they don\u2019t want you to see the bruises.\u201d I\u2019m dumb founded, but brush her off. My mom is a very strong woman and would never let a man lay a hand on her and my dad would never be the man to raise his hand to a woman.\nWe all ignore MIL and talk amongst ourselves. Drinks get poured and they star making light fun that I\u2019m not drinking. I make a few drunk jokes at my expense and my MIL gets angry thinking in her narcissistic mind that I\u2019m talking about her.\nShe gets up glares at me and throws her drink in the sink and storms off. All of us are confused but know she prone to being dramatic and let her have her fit. \nShe wouldn\u2019t sit with us at dinner and refused to speak with me for the rest of the night.\nMy husbands plan was to put the ultrasound picture in his favorite childhood book and give it to her. He handed it to her and she cooed over it saying \u201caw this was your favorite. I used to read this to you all the time\u201d and my husband was getting excited.\nShe opens the book, sees the ultrasound picture and her face falls and goes \u201coh, congrats.\u201d\nMy husband, confused and dejected, says \u201ccongrats? That\u2019s all I get?\u201d MIL gets up and gives him a hug before pushing the ultrasound picture into his hands and sulks on the couch. \nLater in the car my husband was disgusted by his mom. This wasn\u2019t the first thing she had done to him over the years and their relationship is strained. I said I don\u2019t want her in my life, but my husband can take baby to see her whenever he wanted without me. He says he\u2019s okay with that and doesn\u2019t know if he wants her in our child\u2019s life.

This sounds like the last straw of many with your MIL. I doubt anyone would blame you for not wanting any contact with her. Good for your husband for having your back. It doesn't sound like your baby needs to be exposed to her.", "NTA\nFrom what it seems like, MIL is incredibly narcissistic and I doubt that will change. Not to mention the absolute out of pocket comment about your parents. You don't owe anyone forgiveness.", "NTA. She made a ridiculously insulting (and I assume unlikely) comment about your parents, stating your dad was abusive, then got pissed off when you made comments she decided were about her. And frankly who could blame you if it was aimed at her given what she said? Then she can't put her upset feelings aside at the news that you guys are going to have a baby.\n\nShe sounds immature and horrible to be around. Kids pick up on that stuff anyway, so would it make you guys the assholes to not want your child around her? Absolutely not.", "NTA. Keeping your baby away from your MIL would be a good idea. She sounds like a vicious, toxic little b\\*\\*ch.", "Easily NTA\n\nYou made such a massive accomplishment with your husband and your MIL isn't happy? Instead, she makes jokes that should never be spoken. She seems like a very toxic, and in your own words, narcissistic person. I would say it's best to go low contact and stick to thanksgiving with your family, OP.", "NTA she sounds like a nightmare.

Ages ago, when I was pregnant with my first (she's almost 22 now), we told my husband's grandmother in person, so we didn't have to hear about it if she heard it second hand... her response was, \"I don't know if that's a good thing or not!\" Things with her were kinda sketchy before that, but that sealed the deal for me. She always complained she never had the relationship with our kids that she did with my SIL's son, but she burned that bridge and plenty of others, so she only had herself to blame. When people can't be happy for you in your big moments, that's all the information you'll ever need.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because the attention will be taken away from her and _she can't stand that_.\n\nThat's not a person anyone wants to spend time with. She will be mean to your child if she's not the center of the attention. Keep your child away until she addresses her issues.", "Let's put it this way: would you be comfortable leaving your little child in this immature narcissistic woman's care? \"Here Grandma, dear! Don't upset her, now...\" Would you feel the child was safe and loved? I doubt it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad your husband sees it and can hopefully make a decision that prioritises the health and wellbeing of you and bub. And himself!\n\n(Is this normal behaviour for MIL? If this is out of character, perhaps something else is going on and she needs a nudge to seek support.)\n\nCongrats on your pregnancy. Wishing you all the best.", "NTA. And glad your husband has your back. And congratulations on your pregnancy \ud83d\ude42", "NTA she sounds terrible", "On no earth would that make you the AHs. And in all honesty, this is the last thing that you should be concerned about now.\nMy mom and I have a very hard relationship, much like the one you described. I would have never left my child alone with her or let her visit with any other adult aside from myself. Not only do I know she would disrespect my parenting but she would passive aggressively speak ill about me to my child, so she gets no unsupervised access. \nIf your husband is ready to make that decision, let him. He can take his time over this pregnancy but remind him to protect his own peace. He should be excited about becoming a dad, not sad and stressed at how his grown mother will react or behave. NTA.\n\n\nCongratulations on your sweet pea!! I\u2019m wishing you SO much joy and an easy pregnancy! Shit can be rough, but well worth it!", "NTA:  I get the feeling your MIL is an alcoholic and was drunk that night (not an excuse) just sounds like a drunk person and one who's probably drunk often.", "NTA, and what is that family's obsession with drinking? Or is it all her? Is she actually an alcoholic and not wanting to admit it? Yet another in a long list of reasons why y'all and your baby should avoid her.", "NTA.  MIL has issues, and she's taking them out on you.  And it sounds like she takes them out on everybody if she's prone to drama and thinks everything is about her.  Unless she does some work to deal with her stuff, she isn't going to change and she will keep doing exactly what she's doing.  I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to subject your kid to that.", "  NTA. People like this don\u2019t change, she will act like this to your child. Follow your husbands lead, he already says he doesn\u2019t want her around the baby. Take the peace and keep her away. She doesn\u2019t deserve baby cuddles when she acts like a spoiled toddler. \n\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "Both NTA and TA...\n\nMIL sounds like she has a mental health issue going on and needs to seek counseling and/or medical intervention, that's the only reason you might be TA. \n\nNTA because you have every right to not have an abusive person in your child's life. Life can be hard enough without having a person that, by society's standards/expectations, should love your child nearly as much as you do yet will likely abuse them. I would leave the situation up to the husband and support his decision while also advocating for the safety of the child and focus your energy on the family you have created together.", "Nothing makes YTA. i think that you should set boundaries between you and the MIL. She should not be talking about your family that way and she should not be treating anyone that way. if I was you I would cut her out of your life and not let your kid near her. If she treats her son and you like this, who knows what will happen if you leave a kid with her alone for a minute.", "Thank you! I haven\u2019t met anyone who\u2019s dealt with something similar which made me think I was being hormonal from the pregnancy and needed to calm down. But she\u2019s done little things in the past. Making snide remarks and being insulting to try and bring us down then paint herself as the victim.", "OP is none of the asshole.  She can have compassion for whatever addiction/mental illness MIL might have without subjecting herself or her child to the kind of abuse this woman has been dishing out.  And the situation should not just be left up to OPs husband - it's something thy should decide together and be united on.", "Are you high?", "Of course, OP! Don\u2019t be so quick to blame your hormones, usually these feeling are valid just amplified by your hormones more than anything else. She was extremely disrespectful about your family and it made me wonder about other interactions before hand, it seems like she\u2019s quite self centered. Is your husband her only boy? How did his siblings and other family members feel about it? Or is this recent enough you/husband haven\u2019t had a chance to speak with them about it? I\u2019m sorry for the rapid questions, I\u2019m just so mad for you.", "My husband has an older brother and everyone else is super excited. This is also the first grandchild as is brother doesn\u2019t want kids.", "So frustrating. Sounds like she\u2019s just upset to not be the center of the good thing (or anything) happening. I think you\u2019d be wise to keep your distance from her.", "Not sure I\u2019d give access of my kid to her even if hubby is there.", "I\u2019m sorry you are going through this! \nCongratulations on your baby!!\nYou are NOT the asshole!\nYour mil is.\nJust the comments about your parents alone would\u2019ve made me walk out!\nHow dare she?!?", "NTA\n\nJust consider this though there is a chance that she suddenly felt very stupid for all of her attempts at giving you a drink. Like it should have been something she obviously should have known. Narcissist can be very unforgiving of themselves even if they don't say it out loud. But only when they do something that they feel stupid for. Which of course is your fault that they now feel stupid. \ud83d\ude44", "I mean even your husband is reluctant for this child to know his own mom so definitely NTA. She definitely is dramatic and self-absorbed.", "NTA. You're under no obligation to subject your child to the company of someone who clearly has problems. Doesn't matter if it's Grandma. She shouldn't be allowed near your baby until she has addressed her issues.", "NTA, I don't think you thesis anything wrong and I wouldn't blame you for not feeling comfortable around her in future.\n\nIt does sound like you MIL has some serious mental health issues that she should get therapy for. However, I'm  not a fan of excusing people for bad behaviour due to mental health reasons.\n\nAccusing your father of abuse seems so strange, and it makes me wonder if she was projecting or something along those lines. Especially since your partners parents are divorced, there might be more to why MIL reacted the way she did.\n\nAgain I'm not trying to make excuses but rather trying to understand the reasons for her behaviour. Without instantly writing it off as narcisstic or dramatic.", "You said she's a narcisisst. Of course she's not happy about something good and attention-getting happening to someone else. Protect your kid and go no contact.", "NTA", "First of all you guys need to manage your expectations of MIK. Have very firm guidelines around her contact with your child, make it very clear and if she doesn\u2019t follow then she doesn\u2019t have contact. Sounds like she has never had to br responsible for her action hurting anyone in her way. Congratulations best wishes", "I\u2019m going against the grain to say ESH.\n\nThat comment about your parents was completely uncalled for and alone makes your MIL a huge AH. Where did she even get that idea? What was the point of that? Even if it was supposed to be a joke that didn\u2019t land it would have been one made at your expense and not at all appropriate.\n\nSpeaking of jokes made at others\u2019 expense, I don\u2019t see why you decided to \u201clet her have her fit\u201d though. You couldn\u2019t have told her the joke wasn\u2019t about her? I feel like that would have been such an easy misunderstanding to clear up. \n\nI dont think your MIL is in the wrong for simply saying \u201ccongrats\u201d. You wanted a big, happy reaction, but the fact of the matter is you can\u2019t control how others feel. There could be a myriad of reasons she\u2019d be feeling mixed emotions, and she\u2019s allowed to have those feelings. \n\nPrivately you can be disappointed with her reaction, but in front of others the \u201cthat\u2019s all I get\u201d comment shouldn\u2019t have been made. \n\nOverall both your MIL and you and your husband seem kind of petty. You also all seem like you just very much don\u2019t like each other. I would stay low contact for a bit solely for that fact.", "Honestly she sounds like \u201ctrailer trash\u201d! She\u2019s insecure, rude and has no manners. I bet life with her is tiptoeing on eggshells! You\u2019re making your own family. Keep your distance and just delete everything she says or does from your brain. She\u2019s an insecure woman with anger issues. Just laugh at her!", "I mean\n\nAfter how the day was going, is her reaction in any way a surprise?\n\nHonestly sounded entirely predictable and he should have just waited.", "YTA. Learn how to use paragraph breaks, ffs."]}
