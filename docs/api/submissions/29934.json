My brother and I make about the same amount of money a month, and my girlfriend makes almost twice what I do (roughly 80k). I bought this house 10 years ago, and moved my brother in about five years ago and even though I pay roughly 2k a month, he was in college and only made $12 an hour so I\u2019ve offered rent to him at $500 a month utilities included for the last five years. He now makes $25 an hour. \n\nMonthly expenses:\n\nMortgage: 1,500\n\nPower: average is $250\n\nWiFi: 150\n\nGas: 50\n\nWater: 30\n\nGrass: I cut it every two weeks to save money\n\nTotal: $1980\n\nCurrently my brother only contributes $500 a month, so my portion is $1480. Even if I offered my girlfriend $500 a month as well, I\u2019d still be paying $980 compared to them. I think this isn\u2019t fair to me, but they both seem to think because I own the home that it makes perfect sense. \n\nHere\u2019s what I can\u2019t understand:\n\nSay I rented this house out, and we all three moved in together paying someone\u2019s else\u2019s mortgage, more than likely paying far more a month than we would be in my home, while I collect rent from this home at a premium (giving me extra income compared to them):\n\n**How is paying more, for all of our money going towards nothing at all, somehow better than their money going to helping me pay my mortgage down?**\n\nIt\u2019s not like I own the home outright.

The idea of moving somewhere else to pay someone elses mortgage so they can feel like all of our money is being burned is so stupid to me. I just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m also super lenient about things like rent being late, my brother likes having the AC super low which makes the power bill so high in the summer, I don\u2019t say anything about it.

My girlfriend and I will be sharing the master bedroom and bathroom since we\u2019re in a relationship/that\u2019s what we both want. \n2. Her and my brother both work from home and will be sharing the third bedroom as an office, which doesn\u2019t benefit me. \n3. I\u2019ve renovated my garage into a very nice gym with all kinds of work out equipment, flooring, mirrors, etc. that everyone uses. \n4. Yes I pay for all home maintenances and never expect them to pay for any fixes. This also includes trash service, grass cutting, and annual pest inspections and termite protection.   \n5. All big purchases for things used in Gen pop are made by me, 75 inch tv for the living room, shelving, furniture, games, surround sound, new appliances etc. I don\u2019t ask that any of this is split.

And renters don\u2019t argue that their rent should be cheaper because the set rent includes those fees.", "Oh sorry for the confusion, that is what he currently pays but when she moves in in January I wanted to split everything equally. So everyone in the home would pay roughly 660 a month depending on utilities. Also square footage isn\u2019t her issue, her issue is that she doesn\u2019t want to contribute to my equity. She wants to pay less than $500, and has thrown around numbers like $300-$400.", "So what if I moved out entirely and just let my girlfriend and brother live there. Then would it make sense for them to split the rent 50/50 among themselves?", "I see you changed your comment. I can afford my house just fine on my own. What this is all about is everyone paying their fair share. And our original \u201cdeal\u201d being between my brother and I was that I would discount the rent as long as he was working low wage jobs. The only thing I feel I did wrong was not have this all in writing.", "Please articulate to me why it makes more sense to either offer them a fraction of the shared monthly expenses in rent, or to pay more than double what we we\u2019re paying here to go pay someone else\u2019s mortgage?\n\nLike why is it not seen as a much better thing to help out your friends and family obtain wealth and seen as awful to help greedy corporations milk you dry as instead of the opposite?", "I\u2019m really shocked that so much goes toward your principle, how much is interest? The first few years of my mortgage were almost entirely interest payments. I do also live in a place with very high property tax, so maybe I just have a skewed sense of how much of your mortgage is going to taxes. \n\nBut I think others have mentioned this, you have to decide if you want to be their landlord or their family member who lives with them. Keeping in mind that if your house is being rented officially and you\u2019re a landlord, you need to pay tax on that income and may have to pay a different property tax rate. I personally think you\u2019re not crazy for feeling uncomfortable, but they\u2019re also right that they\u2019re family and not random renters. For me it\u2019s NAH", "You wouldn't be profiting that much every month, after taxes and fees. It's unlikely that you'd even be making enough to pay your third split of the rent in the new place.", "Because you pay the full bill if something happens - a burst pipe or something - like a new washing machine etc needs replacing as well as property tax. You need to build up savings just in case", "Um, no? Rent prices are usually set by market value? If you have a lease landlord cannot suddenly raise rent becouse his property tax suddenly grew. Or if lease is ending and landlord decides to raise the rent above the market value renters would simply leave for a cheaper place.\n\nIt is same situation when landlords have same expenses but if whole market value grew many landlords raise the rent accordingly.", "Except rent prices are usually set by the market value. If you want to become \"landlord\" - go ahead, ask them for \"rent\" and stop mentioning them helping with your mortage fees.", "Well that is just frankly ridiculous. You can't rent a parking space for $300 in my city. You commented elsewhere that you've dated for 4 years now, could this be about something other than rent? Totally speculating now, but some women would expect a ring after 4 years, and she might have the mindset of \"if he's not going to committ to me then why would I help him pay off HIS house.\" Which is childish, but I wonder if that's where her mind may be. \n\nAnother shot in the dark, does she get along with your brother? Could she be unhappy about having to move in with him there?", "Definitely. Each would get their own bedroom and split the office each would get their own bathroom.", "You made the deal with your brother and are threatening homelessness if he doesn't pay more.\n\nIt's not the opposite. You are taking the position of the greedy corporations.", "But my point still stands that everyone would be paying far more if we rented from somewhere else, and I would have part of my new rent prorated from the new rental income I\u2019d be getting.", "When's the last time that market value rent couldn't pay for the costs associated with owning the property? Like the great depression?", "Which is why I don\u2019t understand the point of complaining about splitting my rent evenly when my rent is comparatively much cheaper than other places in the area. Like, I don\u2019t want to be a landlord but It people are living with me I do want them to help pay the bills.", "These are interesting things I hadn\u2019t considered, I\u2019ll need to get back to you on those.", "Okay, so what if I move out, let them split the bills, then move in as a tenant and split the bills evenly with them? Like why are people so morally against homeowners having roommates.", "See that\u2019s the difference. I would never threaten homelessness. A landlord would. I wouldn\u2019t kick my friends and family out on the road over money. I\u2019d put every effort into helping them find housing. He makes 25 an hour, he can afford up to $1800 a month in rent on his own but I\u2019m only asking for $660.", "You'd be paying less. But, yes, everyone else would be paying more. \n\nIf you want to start charging them proper rent, you can. But they might not want to pay it to live there. And you really do need to start declaring the income from it. And give them a contract so that they have some security.", "You completely ignored my point but that's on you. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well, if your brother gets one room entirely by himself and your gf would have to share a room with you - that would be unfair to your gf? Since she would need to pay more for less space. Also she wouldn't have landlord-tenant protection in case things do not work out between two of you.\n\nYou can set up the price for rent and if they are unwilling to agree with you - they may need to find other accomodations.", "Hope it works out!", "What happens if they say no?", "I didn't ignore your point. I invalidated it. There's a difference.", "That's because your point is a bit irrelevant.  You're fixating on one statement, that his mortgage went up because of property taxes.  If your point is that a landlord shouldn't raise rent above market rate purely on the basis that his outlay went up, erm...cool.  But what is the relevance of that here?\n\nOP is charging WAY under market rate at cost to himself.  Now with the added increase, it's even worse for him, that's why he mentioned it, not because he thinks his roomies should bear the burden of that increase.  Were he to charge them for equal use of space (his costs split 3 ways), that would still be under market rate.  So once again, I'm struggling to see your point.", "They\u2019re paying for the entire house though, and they both will split the third bedroom as an office. Why would my girlfriend move in with me and us have separate rooms?", "Then I\u2019ll give him anywhere from 2-3 months to find another place to live."]}
