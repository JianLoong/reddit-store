It's ok to want to have personal space, especially since your mom is better. If you want to still sleep with her sometimes, just do that. Sleep by yourself when you want to, and when you want your mom, ask her to join. It sounds like you and your mother have a strong bond, just remember it's ok to say no.", "NTA\n\nNothing wrong with wanting privacy.   So talk to her about it.   Why is your room more comfortable, is it because she's sharing it with you, or because of some other aspect of the room?   Are you planning on living with her forever?", "NTA. I would sit down & talk with your mom letting her know how you feel. At 22 you definitely need your privacy but you also want to stay close with her.  Ask her for her input.  You said that you have a close relationship so I\u2019m sure she will understand", "NAH\n\nWish I had a solution for you, Can your mom's room be updated to make it more comfortable for you? Some paint, maybe a new daybed? Give yourself options. Sleep alone in your new room. Sleep together in her new room.\n\nYou haven't asked for judgement on your relationship with your mother. NTA for wanting to sleep alone, or not.", "Info: who owns the house? Do you pay rent? Where she would sleep?", "NTA but maybe sleep in the same bed some nights and separately others.", "NAH.  Whatever you decide to do is fine.  You seems a little conflicted so try one of the compromise solutions.  I don\u2019t think it would be a problem if your mom slept in both rooms over the course of the week.  Try to make each room very comfortable for both of you.", "NTA - you sound like a very caring daughter. I think the compromise you raised is good. Or, if you think your room is more comfortable you can let her continue to sleep there and you sleep in her room sometimes ?", "NAH- I think you should talk with her before making any decisions,  maybe if you both understand where you stand you can come up with a solution together.", "Um. What now? You sleep with your mom?", "Was just thinking this. Why not switch rooms, and If her bed is comfy you take that and she can have yours. I'm guessing her room is larger so it's be an upgrade anyway.", "It's not that unusual. I know a lot of families (single parent plus child) who started it for one or another reason and kept it that way. Also after the child became an adult. Considering we come from living in bigger families were not everyone had their own room it's not necessarily icky or something. \n\nNow we live in times were living space becomes more and more expensive and moving out is not an option to many. If they are comfortable - why judge them? \n\nOP how ever is NTA and should just sit down with mom and talk about it. OP, if you really are so close with her, she'll understand and you will find a good solution. Just go for it.", "My room was newly renovated, it has a new bed and AC and is quieter (the street sounds can be heard more in her room). I\u2019m probably moving out once I get married. In our country it\u2019s common for people to live with their parents until marriage (though not everyone does that).", "Parents own the house. She has an old room, though the AC is not as good and it\u2019s noisier since it\u2019s nearer the streets.", "So, if the options were to switch rooms with your mother, or share your room with your mother, which would you choose?", "I think I\u2019d share my room with her\u2026 since we\u2019re already doing that."]}
