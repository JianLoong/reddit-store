I\u2019m sure if you don\u2019t follow the rules you\u2019ll get kicked out of the program.\n\nGoing forward, I would say let them use the program since it\u2019s a great perk, but just make sure they follow the rules so you don\u2019t get kicked out. If they don\u2019t want to follow the rules, change your login info and don\u2019t share it.

It's as good as using your credit card without asking you in my book, NTA\n\nEdit: Anything you get from Vine is taxed as income, so it's more accurate to say these items are heavily discounted vice free, as you end up paying for them during tax season.", "NTA, it is weird, and if your MIL really didn't think it was a big deal, then she would have told you about it", "Dude, you\u2019re going to have to pay taxes on all of those items. Every item you order from Vine has an estimated tax value, and you\u2019re responsible for that when tax time comes around. MIL is horribly entitled, a sneak, and a thief.

Also you can't keep something a secret it you don't know it's supposed to be one.", "I was all headed for a \u201cwhy does it matter\u201d response until I got to the part where she implies that she had bought the stuff. Yikes. Nevertheless, it\u2019s strange you felt the need to call her out publicly. ESH", "I'm so confused. Why does it matter if you aren't out any money?", "I would say you're both TAH in your own ways... It's shady of her to order things on your account through this program without telling you and try to pass it off as if she bought these gifts for everyone with her money\u2014but you're also in the wrong. If they're following all the requirements of the program (ie. posting reviews for the products they received) then it costs you nothing to let them use this account. You could've had a conversation with your MIL separately about the matter but you chose to embarrass her in front of everyone over an issue that a) wasn't *that* big of a deal and b) couldn't been dealt with privately.", "yta why do you care? how is this important? if it didnt cost anything why is this even an issue? she. it wasnt hurting anyoine or effecting anyone. she used a thing u willingly gave her access to  to get free things that she gave as gifts. like how is this even an issue?", "INFO:  Why are you feeling weirded out by someone who YOU have given access to your account, found free shit on there, and ordered it?", "NAH\n\nShe got some gifts for free using a thing you don't use. Why the heck not? Maybe she figured out how to search better than you lol\n\nIt made some people happy. \n\nI'm not sure why you've got a problem with it, but I can understand any initial confusion\n\nGoing full AH from here though is probably a bad move\n\nVine costs the account holder a set fee per year. Nothing per purchase and no tax", "Letting someone else use your Vine account is against the rules. OP pays income tax on all the so called \"free\" stuff. But the program terms it must be used only by household members. Everything must get reviewed per the Amazon guidelines.", "Yeah. This is the serious thing about this - it\u2019s not exactly free due to the taxes. Plus you have to review a certain number of items. There\u2019s a reason why they only selected a limited number of people to do this.", "I would have called her out too. The fucking entitlement of some people staggers me. It's not her account for one,  two, she didn't ask for permission, and three, she's gifting this shit like some baller (oh, it's nothing!) And he pays taxes on it. Why on earth would someone do that with something that wasn't hers? Fucking nervy if you ask me. But I wasn't raised like that and I know better, thanks mom for teaching me respect for other people's things.", "Oh geez.. I didn't pick that up when I read it \ud83d\ude33", "OP IS out the money if she lives in the US, if MIL vined $500 worth of stuff then OP pays income tax (not sales tax but income tax) on that $500. Plus she could get thrown out of Vine. Vine Products must be reviewed. and Vine products are only for use by household members. If Amazon had reason to suspect others are using her Vine account or things aren't being reviewed or things are given to people outside the household, they can throw her out if the program.", "I think it\u2019s because of this comment\n\n> she laughed and said it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that she loves to treat the family\n\nShe\u2019s passing on the gifts as if she paid for them. Did OP spend any money? No. The money *isn\u2019t* the point here, though. OP has very generously allowed his in-laws access to his Amazon account and let them know that they could get a little tidbit for themselves (like the phone case example)\n\nIn-laws abused this policy. OP says there were 50+ orders placed. MIL could\u2019ve just asked OP if she could order all those items for the fam, or come clean and said she got them for free via the vine thingy\u2026 but she passed it off as her own. She wants recognition but is cheapskate. The only reason she got all those items is bc they were free, and they were free bc of OP.", "OP IS out the money if she lives in the US, if MIL vined $500 worth of stuff then OP pays income tax (not sales tax but income tax) on that $500.

OP must pay income tax on them value of Vine items And could lose access to the program if Amazon has reason to suspect others are using it. There's a lot of rules for Vine members.", "Because it isn\u2019t really free. The Vine member is responsible for paying taxes on the items.

Kind of seems like that's something worth mentioning, yeah?", "Well I don't know, not got a vine account,  but op said they came up as free on the account? Also not like they had to pay\n\n10% of 0 is still 0\n\nETA the vine account costs the account holder pet year. Nothing else. This woman has cost the op nothing", "Obviously MIL already knew:  The fact that she tried to pass off the stuff as things she bought and didn't tell the OP what she was doing tells us that she knew exactly what she was doing - using OP's access to the program, hiding it, and lying about it. OP is NTA. OH AND you just don't \"find free stuff\". It's a special link. You can't get there from your regular Amazon link.", "No, that\u2019s not the way it works. I am a Vine member. You don\u2019t pay for the item, but every item has an estimated tax value. There are some things that have an estimated tax value of zero, but those are few and far between (unless you like to buy a LOT of hair extensions; those are always zero ETV for some reason). At the end of the year, Amazon sends you a tax statement and you find out what you will owe on the Vine items you ordered. OP is going to have to pay tax on the items MIL stole from his account.", "I don't pay tax on mine at any pont(rather my daughter)\n\nAs far as I am aware if you don't sell them on you don't need to either\n\nmy tax laws are probably nicer than yours but don't assume everyone is the ah just because their laws are not yours. \n\nMaybe rhe mum for the op is unaware of your tax? Then they should tell her before getting shitty", "Gosh yes other places have different tax laws should absolutely get a down vote\n*Giggles*"]}
