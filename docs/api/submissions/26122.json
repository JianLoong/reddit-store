We were good mates at uni but lost touch for reasons unknown to me. No contact whatsoever, not even a 'Happy Birthday' on social media.  \nFirst, it's public knowledge among my circle that I have a fairly good job, something Emily is also aware of. The wedding invitation came with a 'suggested gift' list that consists mostly of pretty high-end items. This gives me the impression that the primary reason for my invite is to secure an expensive wedding gift.  \nFurthermore, we haven't spoken in 7 years and there has been zero effort from her side to maintain or rekindle the friendship, making this invitation seem even more opportunistic. I also learned through mutual friends that one of our 'minimum wage' mutual friends have not been invited, but who has been in contact with her more recently than I have. This makes me question why I would be on the guest list when he wasn't.   \nFinally, while I do have other plans and priorities, I could potentially make time for the wedding if it were a significant event for someone important to me. However, given the current circumstances, I feel less inclined to rearrange my schedule.  \nI politely declined the invitation and offered my best wishes for her nuptials. Now, I'm hearing through the grapevine that Emily and some mutual friends think I'm being snobbish and insensitive for declining.\n\nSo, am I the arsehole for not attending this wedding and suspecting that the primary reason for my invitation is for an expensive gift?", "created_utc": 1693743645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168vlal/aita_for_declining_a_wedding_invite_when_i_havent/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can decline an invitation for whatever reason. No contact in 7 years, I would decline and not give it much thought.", "NTA you aren't even really friends if you haven't spoken in 7 years so there is no reason to go.", "NTA - You are correct that this was a gift grab, and what Emily is probably upset about is that some people will customarily send a gift when they decline and you didn't (and shouldn't have). Her wedding is not an appropriate venue to reconnect with you if she really wanted that.", "NTA. You don't need to accept someone's invite or instantly become close again just because you were sent an invite.\n\nI feel it is worth thinking however that you probably don't know her reasons for inviting you. You have to think, she would have to be pretty confident that the gift you decide to buy her will far outweigh the costs of what she is already paying per person for this decision to be justified. Maybe someone mentioned you to her and she was reminded of your previous friendship and wanted to become close again. \n\nIt might be worth just sending her a private message explaining that you have stuff on and were unsure if you could make it but that you hope the wedding goes smoothly and that you know she will have a wonderful day regardless.", "NTA. Declining an invitation is not snobbish- people have lives, they have other things going on, and like you said, you haven't talked for nearly a decade. If Emily wants to talk shit about it, does it really matter? She's not part of your life anymore, just ignore it and move on.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. You know you were invited for the gift, which she feels entitled to even though you declined", "NTA.  It's an invite, not a subpoena.  I think your spider senses are right on, sounds like she was looking for an expensive gift.  Saying you're snobbish and insensitive for declining is absurd as you are under no obligation to go.  You are totally in your right to forget about this and move on.", "NTA. It's an invitation, not an obligation. Decline the invite, send a card of congratulations if you want. Nothing wrong with any of that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

NTA.", "Considering you haven't spoken to this person in 7 years, you have an awful lot of \"inside intel\" about her motivations and feelings about all this.  If that's the case because you still share a lot of the same social circle, then it's not wild for you to have gotten an invitation.\n\nNAH. I doubt anyone cares about this as much as you're saying.", "NTA, *BUT* I would have handled it differently. You said you met \u201cEmily\u201d at uni and another friend was not invited. That leads me to believe that some of your other uni friends will be there. If it was me, I would go just to hang out with old friends and catch up. You probably won\u2019t see the bride for more than 5 minutes anyway. \n\nIf you want to crank it up a notch (and this *would* make you an asshole, so do it at your own discretion), constantly mention to the uni friends that you\u2019re nervous about the gift you left on the gift table because it\u2019s just an envelope and has a lot of cash in it. This way, when bride gossips to uni friend that you\u2019re cheap, they\u2019ll say, \u201coh no!  MidniteUK put an envelope full of cash on the gift table!  Someone must have stolen it!\u201d  And there\u2019s your petty revenge.\n\nAnd I have actually done this, but it was a surprise birthday party. A buddy and I from college were invited to a birthday party far out of town. It was a 3 hour drive for me and a 4 hour drive for him. We received an invitation with suggested gift items and they were all at least $500. Sooo, a surprise birthday party where the birthday girl has a wishlist???  Yeahhhh, she\u2019s full of shit.  We talked to other friends who were less well-off and their suggested items were $5-100. So, buddy and I (best friends for 20 years at this point) decided to go just to hang with old friends. Since we knew she\u2019d open the gifts there, unlike a wedding where it\u2019s opened later, we had to bring something. I knew she loved coffee from all her Facebook posts, so I got her $20 Dunkin\u2019 Donuts gift card. Oh. Wait. No. I *regifted* her a $20 Dunkin\u2019 Donuts card that I already had and may have even used once (I don\u2019t remember). My buddy got her a $10 frying pan from TJ Maxx and taped a \u201cDouble Coupon Voucher\u201d from Kroger (like Tesco) to the inside because we used to use those in college when they\u2019d have sales and gets super cheap (or free) snacks. \n\nSide story\u2026. I remember one time they had potato chip/crisp packets on sale for 85\u00a2 and we had coupons for 50\u00a2 off. But we used the double coupon voucher which made our coupons $1 off of an item that was only $0.85. The coupons weren\u2019t a limit of 1, so we bought almost 400 bags. We cleared them out. AND they wouldn\u2019t give us cash for the difference (it was like $58), but they gave us store credit!!  Kroger was awesome. Still is. And not the only time we did that at Kroger. \n\nAnyway, back to the birthday party. We had a great time and got to the gifts. She opens them all and you could see she was visibly upset by our lackluster gifts. Well, I didn\u2019t say it, but I kept thinking, \u201cyou haven\u2019t talked to either of us in 10-15 years!!!  You think I\u2019m plonking down $500 on a TV you want just because you made me drive 3 hours, pay for gas, pay for a hotel, and pay for meals (aside from the party food)?  Fuck you!\u201d  She was relatively cold to us for the rest of the party and afterward, we heard through the grapevine that she called us cheap. That\u2019s fine because we knew she wasn\u2019t going to talk to us again anyway. Although, had we gotten her expensive gifts, I\u2019m sure she would have invited us to the next surprise party she threw for herself.", "NTA.  I understand your reasoning on her intentions behind the invite But that\u2019s not the point here.  It\u2019s an invitation not a summons.  You are within your rights to decline.  I think you made the right decision btw.", "lol NTA. Obvious attempt at greed. Respectfully decline the invitation.", "NtA. She ended your friendship not you", "You know it is illegal to ignore an invitation?\n\nNVM, I mixed it up with a subpoena, NTA.", "NTA.  As you will be told more than once, an invite is neither a summons nor an invoice, although the bride certainly tried to make it the latter. Good for you for not falling for the gift grab.", "Yeah fair point. Might do that. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "If she truly wanted to rekindle a friendship, she would have reached out to you when you RSVP\u2019ed no and expressed while she\u2019s sad you aren\u2019t coming but would love together for lunch sometime soon. \n\nDon\u2019t waste another second on a person who is virtually a stranger who wanted to dip into your deep pockets. If you email her, you\u2019ll only be giving her potential ammo to twist into something to gossip about you. Once she gets a yes RSVP back from someone else she\u2019s trolling for a high end wedding gift, she\u2019ll forget all about you again for at least another 7 years.", "If she wants a friendship with you, it won't matter that you said no.", "If she was interested in rekindling a friendship, I\u2019d think she would have reached out before an invite with a suggested gift list. You\u2019re nice to consider reaching out, but when you declined, the first thing she did was to talk badly behind your back. Why waste your time?"]}
