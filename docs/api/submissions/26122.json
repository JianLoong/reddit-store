No contact whatsoever, not even a 'Happy Birthday' on social media.  \nFirst, it's public knowledge among my circle that I have a fairly good job, something Emily is also aware of. The wedding invitation came with a 'suggested gift' list that consists mostly of pretty high-end items. This gives me the impression that the primary reason for my invite is to secure an expensive wedding gift.  \nFurthermore, we haven't spoken in 7 years and there has been zero effort from her side to maintain or rekindle the friendship, making this invitation seem even more opportunistic. I also learned through mutual friends that one of our 'minimum wage' mutual friends have not been invited, but who has been in contact with her more recently than I have. This makes me question why I would be on the guest list when he wasn't.   \nFinally, while I do have other plans and priorities, I could potentially make time for the wedding if it were a significant event for someone important to me. However, given the current circumstances, I feel less inclined to rearrange my schedule.  \nI politely declined the invitation and offered my best wishes for her nuptials.

OP I wouldn't even give this a second thought.  NTA.", "Well that's a bit excessive.\n\nMaybe. Definitely maybe not. It's standard practice (tacky as it may be) to include a gift registry on wedding invites. Bride could have any number of reasons not to invite that one other mutual friend. Assuming that the ONE reason is income is quite a stretch. And it isn't all that unusual for people to reach back to old acquaintances to try to rekindle friendships when they get married or something.\n\nSo the obsession (from both OP and commenters) with whether the invite is just to get a gift is overblown. It's also totally unnecessary. Don't want to go to a wedding? Don't feel that close? No obligation to go. NTA of course.", "[removed]", "Ahaha brilliant", "This is the one true answer", "Or like there\u2019s a table for 8 and 7 guests from your group at uni and you were the first person to come to mind to fill that spot.", "She might not be paying anything at all.  Could be one or both sets of parents.  In that case each guest is pure profit for the bride.", "Yeah, it sounds like there are some mutual friends trying to stir up some drama. It wouldn't occur to me to worry about the reason for an invitation if I'm declining. I might just make a mental note of it and reach out a few months after the wedding in case it was a genuine effort at rekindling friendship.", "You haven\u2019t talked to someone in 7 years but you\u2019re confident they know you\u2019re wealthy because\u2026 reasons? Just because I know someone is a doctor or something doesn\u2019t mean I know their debt or family obligations RE:money.  Including a gift registry is pretty normal for weddings where I\u2019m from so I\u2019m very confused by your offense to that. \n\nYour minimum wage friend that wasn\u2019t invited- again, you haven\u2019t occupied a room with the both of them in 7 years, why presume to know anything about their relationship or why they weren\u2019t invited? \n\n\nESH because you seem to be assuming bad intentions off the bat & for her, calling you a snob when for all she knows maybe you had a trip scheduled or some immovable thing as the reason why you aren\u2019t going.", "Exactly what I was going to say. In my experience, very rarely do gifts even cover the expense incurred to have the guest. It would be quite a gamble to invite someone purely on the off chance that you\u2019ll turn up a profit. Also, the average cost of a wedding is in the tens of thousands $. At this point, OP\u2019s gift would be a drop in the bucket.

I'd say there's a very real chance that there's NAH in this one.", "Yeah, it's not a standard practice to include a list of very expensive gifts you want in a wedding invite.

Both pretty large.\n\nIf there\u2019s a registry it\u2019s only sent upon request. \n\nFurthermore, Emily sent an invitation with zero expectation that OP would attend after 7 years of no contact. Emily was hoping OP would send a gift as some people do after declining.\n\nIt was a tacky attempt at a gift grab. Nothing more.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being downvoted.

No contact for years then suddenly an invite including a list of expensive suggested gifts?  You're getting rolled for money, full stop, and anyone who suggests you have some obligation to attend is participating in that scam.  Don't give it another thought OP, this person is not your friend.", "So I can see how this may come off this way. But I do want to raise this point: do you have mutual friends who are going? I was invited to a wedding once where I had lost touch with the person getting married, but I had a couple mutual single friends who were closer, and what basically ended up happening was, I was invited as well because the couple didn\u2019t want to give plus ones and have random people there, so they sat 4 of us from our college friend group days at the same table.", "NTA but you are correct. I don\u2019t understand the snobbiness emanating from OP\u2019s post. Maybe the friend just thought it would be a nice gesture to see some old friends at her wedding. Or maybe not. Who cares? Neither of you have talked for 7 years and I presume this will continue to be the case. Registries are also common and no one is obligated to purchase something off it. If you don\u2019t want to go, decline, move on.", "50$ Visa gift card and you're done.", "But OP treats Emily like a stranger, and that feels so rough...", "No, the chance of NAH stopped as soon as Emily did not invite the male but poor friend that she had more contact to than OP.", "It totally is over here. How are people supposed to know what to gift you? I'm not having the hassle of answering all my guest with the same message when we can just send them a link to an online registry. But you fill that list with a range of gifts varying from expensive ones to cheaper ones. You parents or direct family might get you that Espresso maker. Your coworker can get you some coffee cups. Totally normal etiquette.", "For a certain class of wedding? Yes, it is standard. I never said it wasn't trashy. Of course it is.", "I don't know why. That's the point. It would be myopic to think it could only be any ONE reason. Maybe they have contact, but that contact included a recent dispute. Maybe the mutual friend caught feels for the bride. Maybe he told the bride he'd love to be there but he has unavoidable travel plans so she didn't send an invite. Maybe he was invited and it just got delayed in the mail. Maybe OP's 3rd-hand info is wrong. Maybe the mutual friend is an ethnic minority and the bride is worried because her family is racist. Maybe that mutual friend is gay and that groom's family is super intolerant of that.\n\nMy point is just that there are SOOOO many reasons--good ones and bad ones--that this could be the case. Assuming it could only be one is unnecessary. OP can just not go, regardless of the reason for the invite. No obligation to do so.", "Yeah, different communities have different norms, but including a registry on an invite is by no means uncommon in many many populations.\n\nI mean, it is definitely ONE possibility that this was Emily's thinking.\nBut one of many, many plausible possibilities. I'm not trying to defend Emily, I'm just saying there is no reason for us to rely on such an unnecessary basis to justify OP's declining the invite. Because that's not the reason OP can decline without being an AH. She can just decline for whatever reason just because she doesn't want to go.", "Agreed. If the bride wanted to be clear it wasn't a gift grab, she could have also sent a wedding announcement (sent the day or after the wedding) rather than an invitation to someone she hasn't spoken to in 7 years.", "Who knows though. Bride could\u2019ve invited OP to reconnect, seen the declined RSVP, and assumed that OP didn\u2019t want to reconnect.
