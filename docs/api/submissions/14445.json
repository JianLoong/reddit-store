I give your dad AH for overreaction, not gonna say wrong tho.\n\nI do not think your dad was super gracious to act that way, but I also don't think it's beneficial to pretend to like things if you don't.\n\nSo, I don't think it's gross to wear old clothes or.  Thrift and you say you washed it.  I think it was properly presented and you did nothing wrong there.\n\nThe issue is his personal comfort level, and we don't really give guys a lot of room to have comfort issues. So, I think it's kinda silly but I can also believe some people like your dad find it disturbing or gross.  He should not have to man up or reevaluate his value system to enjoy a present.  This is not a present he liked.\n\nIf you get something second hand, it just needs to be super thoughtful.  You don't describe it too much.  But if it's just a solid or plain hoody, that's kind meh?

Secondhand and thrifted gifts can be awesome. I'd just take this as an indication that he turns out not to like thrifted goods.

Getting clothes randomly from a relative doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s okay with clothes from strangers nor that he wants something thrifted for his birthday. You just chose something you would personally like, which is kind of thoughtless. You mentioned your budget was $10 which in my opinion is still enough to find something for any hobby or taste.

It's someone's 'throw away' stuff. I'd be mad too if I got that for a birthday. \n\nAnd it's very understandable he sees it as unhygienic. It's more a mental thing. Yes it gets cleaned but there are some very nasty people in the world, and you don't know the previous (sweaty? unhygienic? smelly?) owner. Very different than a hand-me-down from a relative! So yeah, it's kinda gross. \n\nAlso, 'cheap' is a bad excuse. There are plenty of stores that have brand new cheap clothing. (15-25 dollar for shirt etc). We've all bought items that are not environmental or ethically 'right', so don't even use that as an excuse.", "NTA>Lots of clothes in old days  had bugs in them which made them pretty awful to deal with.

I am all about buying stuff used for myself, but I would only give someone something used as a gift if they had told me explicitly that they were okay with used items.

I donate tons of shit every year. Me and the gf get used puzzles. Yeah it's a bummer when they have 1 or 2 missing pieces. But you can donate them again when you're done. I rarely get lucky on clothes. Or records. But it's cool to check out. The one time I got a super nice ski jacket for 30 bucks. Left in my underground parking guest spot(gf takes the one secured spot) smashed window. Jacket gone. 6 dollars change gone. Like buddy. If ur cold I would have given you the jacket.

His dad is the A. H. Even if you truly believe you shouldn't give second hand gifts, which is just a completely absurd generality because there are PLENTY of people who are fine with it (see majority of this thread), reacting with hostility is unnecessary and incredibly rude!

Your intention is good, but from a receiver standpoint an unannounced second hand cloth as gift could easily be interpreted as disrespectful (and seriously culturally insensitive if you do that with international friends from nations that really emphasise on underlying message in every actions, like Japan for example). Giving second hand item as gifts should always be treated carefully, like even if that item had long ceased production in 1970s you would still have to at least communicate beforehand, make sure this particular item (not even category, that particular item) is to their liking before even buying it.

If you show up with such an item as gift without proper communication beforehand, the one getting it is entitled to be upset, this is actual decency to consider this factor.

I wonder if he would have even said anything if you had just kept that part of it away from him.", "Nope but your father is", "I gift my son cool thrifted T-shirts all the time.\nNTA.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give your dad any gifts.", "NTA", "NTA.  Next year just give him a card. He doesn't deserve the time you put in.", "It was a kind and thoughtful gift and your Dad should've accepted it graciously. NTA. I love the thrifted things my kids have given me.", "FYI most thrift stores do not wash their clothing unless they specifically say they do. If they don\u2019t say they do, always assume they are unwashed and wash them when you bring them home immediately.", "NTA but your Dad sure acts \u201centitled\u201d. Some of us grew up in those \u201cused\u201d clothes and were very grateful if they had some \u201clife\u201d left in em. That you were able to find a really nice one? We called it a \u201cscore\u201d. Does he not understand your financial situation?", "NTA. You gave a gift that was well meaning and within your budget. He is the butthole for not accepting it!", "NTA. It's not underwear for god sakes. He's not going to get sick from wearing a sweatshirt. He is being ridiculous. Next time presents are due, he gets nothing.", "NTA because you meant well and you are not experienced in gifting, but next time refrain from gifting used things unless you are certain the person would want them.", "NTA. My aunt bought me 2 pairs of expensive Italian leather shoes when I was a teenager (been a size 13 since I was 14yo). Both pairs have seen multiple repairs but I still wear them occasionally. I've now owned them close to 20 years. Your gift was thoughtful and within your means, so next year when you get him nothing he should know why", "ESH. Everyone's TA. Your dad for not just being polite and saying thank you. You for giving used clothing as a gift. Who does that? It's fine if you like thriftng, but many people don't want to wear clothes that previously belonged to strangers. They certainly don't want to receive it as a gift.", "I gave my dad a thrifted shirt last Christmas. Even worse, I originally bought it for my husband but it was too small for him. So I technically gave my dad a re-gifted, thrifted shirt! He loves it and wears it a lot. NTA.", "NTA the only clothes you don't thrift are underwear, and probably socks and hats.", "NTA. Thrifting actually takes more time and effort. Good for you!", "lol I work in an office and almost every work outfit I wear came from Goodwill. I can afford new clothes but would rather spend money elsewhere. What a weird hangup.\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nYour dad is, however, but for being an ass about it instead of gently explaining that he's a bit squicked  out.\n\nI personally love thrifted things from years of doing car boots when I was younger - there's some really cool barely used stuff out there. I also know some people who wouldn't even dream of getting second hand anything! Now that you know some folks are really averse to it, next time you want to get something that's thrifted for a gift just remember to  check with the intended recipient to make sure it's fine so that all your effort is properly appreciated.", "NTA. That was a lovely thought, and it's sad your dad was so rude about it. But not everyone is a fan of thrifted clothes. I am - probably 90% of my wardrobe is thrifted - but a couple of my friends think it's icky, and I'd never consider getting them anything thrifted, even if I know they'd love the item.  \n\n\nI always say that clothes, shoes and art are things that people are better off buying themselves, rather than being given as gifts. Taste is a personal thing, as you found out.", "This. But, OP, I'd stop telling people. Some people are weird about second hand stuff. I used second hand stuff most of my life, but I rarely told anyone as much.", "INFO:  Did OP know how dad would react ahead of time?\n\nI already know the preferences of my immediate family when it comes to secondhand clothing. It's not like a big mystery. The thing that would make me call out Y T A is if OP knew how dad would react and did it as a way to prove a point.", "It doesn't sound like the kid knew Dad would react that way, though. I agree that in the future your ideas are excellent suggestions.", "Have you ever tried any new clothing before buying it at a store?\n\nIf so don't assume you're the only one who wore it that day.", "I wear almost exclusively thrifted clothes\n\nthe worst problem was light BO (on something from a friend! if it stunk it wouldn't have sold in thrift stores I'm sure!) and it was remedied with a quick vinegar wash solved...\n\nI do think a little less of people who are afraid of secondhand clothes. Like your phone or any random door handle is more gross than the clothes.", "I agree with you, but I think it just bas to do with not wanting to wear clothes others wore.  I don\u2019t need to explain it logically.  \n\nReminds me of a skeptic conference where everyone said it\u2019s just clothes.  Then you tell them \u201cDahmer killed someone while wearing this sweatier\u201d and it feels icky even though we know it isn\u2019t.  We have beliefs even if we know they are factually baseless", "Did your dad have a favourite team?", "Aw, that's sweet. I get my dad nice quality thrifted clothes sometimes too. And you know what? He's really proud of me for finding something nice for cheap! He'll squeeze a penny until it screams, he'd find this whole \"thrift clothes are unsanitary\" thing ridiculous.", "I like how folks haven't mentioned most countries tend to use polymer bills. Yes they're made of plastic but the nifty thing is if you find a dirty bill you can literally wash you bills or spray them in alcohol spray and they will be fine.", "Yea aside from a few hole in the wall ones I\u2019ve been to while traveling in touristy areas, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a thrift store *not* wash their intakes. Must be a regional thing.", "IKEA and Amazon have those \"second chance\" sections you can shop from ironically", "Your metal coins leave a smell on your skin but that's because its your skins natural oils reacting with the coins.. \n\nIf your skin reacts to polymer bills and paper money however. I think you shoul see a doctor.", "That's very true. Hand me downs. And especially any piece of clothing at a store that sells new clothes. shirts and pants and everything in between. (Well maybe except under garments) As well as you can't just assume everyone who went in to try some clothing before buyung had bathed that day before heading to the store.", "Any bill you have might have been used for cocaine. Could've been used in a strip club. If the faces on those bills could talk imagine the stories of their travels."]}
