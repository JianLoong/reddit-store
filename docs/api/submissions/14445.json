People don't choose the gifts they get.  A thrifted hoodie absolutely qualifies as a gift.  Credit where it's due: that was resourceful of you!  \n\nMy SIL got a used pillow case as a gift last year.  That turned some heads... \n\nYou are doing life right, and I applaud you.", "NTA.\n\nAs a dad, I would be upset if my kids spent a lot on me - but even then, I would try to hide it as best I could because it makes me feel really ungrateful.\n\nAs far as the hoodie being second hand? No big deal. If it was underwear or a toothbrush, I could see having a problem with it.", "NTA\n\n\nIt's ridiculous how clothes turned into something that's rather thrown in the trash than repaired or given to someone else.", "NTA\n\nYour Dad sounds like an ungrateful jerk. I'm just happy to get a gift from my kids. Next time give him nothing.", "NTA - I've frequently got members of my family second-hand/thrifted gifts. There's nothing wrong with it, provided that the item is in good-condition, suitable for second-hand use etc, and you're as thoughtful about it as you would be giving a 'new' item. You didn't know that your Dad would freak out about it; the hoodie was nice, and you'd cleaned it properly before gifting it in addition to the shop cleaning it. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  I give your dad AH for overreaction, not gonna say wrong tho.\n\nI do not think your dad was super gracious to act that way, but I also don't think it's beneficial to pretend to like things if you don't.\n\nSo, I don't think it's gross to wear old clothes or.  Thrift and you say you washed it.  I think it was properly presented and you did nothing wrong there.\n\nThe issue is his personal comfort level, and we don't really give guys a lot of room to have comfort issues. So, I think it's kinda silly but I can also believe some people like your dad find it disturbing or gross.  He should not have to man up or reevaluate his value system to enjoy a present.  This is not a present he liked.\n\nIf you get something second hand, it just needs to be super thoughtful.  You don't describe it too much.  But if it's just a solid or plain hoody, that's kind meh?  Did it have a logo or something that would have a meaning to him or you thought he would really like?  If it was his bday and you could afford new, would you still buy a shirt?\n\nYou could have bought second hand tools for him, or found a framed art-- you dad may or may not like these by they avoid this discomfort he has in used clothes.\n\nI would just call this a learning experience.  You know to go new or not in the future, and hopefully the adults learn to pipe down.\n\nThis just shouldn't be such a big deal.", "NTA Many of the clothes I buy at thrift stores are brand new.

He doesnt have to like the gift, but a simple thank you would have done just fine.", "NTA. Your dad and some members of your family have bizarre beliefs about thrifting and cleanliness. Even if he doesn't like it, just be polite and say thank you for the gift.", "NTA. \n\nBut plenty of people have that mentality regarding second-hand shops, some hide behind the \u201chygiene\u201d others behind \u201cit carries bad energy/juju\u201d.

If it's unusable, it's visible to you and you wouldn't buy it.

Most of the used clothes are from people who outgrew them or had no space for them.", "NTA, you got him a gift, it\u2019s his problem if he doesn\u2019t like it.", "Nta but you are kidding yourself that thrift stores wash and disinfect clothes.", "My favourite sweatshirt is a vintage 1995 rose bowl one, it's from landfill I think. \n\nNTA because recycling is the future.", "NTA\n\nWelcome to adulthood, when you start to see that your parents are flawed human beings. \n\nYour dad overreacted and was  inconsiderate to you as a human and as his child.

If not, see sentence #1 and learn to protect yourself emotionally.", "His reaction wasn't ok given that the gift was from you, but at the same time not everyone is ok with wearing used clothes.", "NTA. As a mom of teens, I\u2019d be over the moon if they spent their own time and money to choose something specifically for me. You did good OP. I\u2019m sorry your father acted like an ungrateful asshole.", "NTA. But now you know how much your efforts are not appreciated. Funny, when we were children, we were taught never to criticize a present, especially to the giver and in public. Apparently your dad forgot the lesson.", "NTA, you\u2019re in high school (assumingly unemployed) and you still went out of your way to pick something out. My parents would never react in that manner if that were me in your shoes. Your dads the AH big time. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to fake-like a gift if he really didn\u2019t like it.", "I mean, I wouldn't be thrilled about a thrifted clothing item as a gift but I probably wouldn't say anything. \n\nYou can buy a new hoodie at Walmart or target for pretty cheap. I'd rather have that than some old hoodie that still vaguely smells like its previous owner and always will.", "NTA He wouldn't be getting more gifts from me.", "NTA. Secondhand and thrifted gifts can be awesome. I'd just take this as an indication that he turns out not to like thrifted goods. No need to apologise AT ALL to him and next time, maybe he only gets a card for his birthday because he doesn't want you using your ingenuity to get him a cool gift that doesn't cost the earth.", "I think NAH as Dad is allowed to feel that way and want new or nothing but you\u2019re not TA as you didn\u2019t know", "NTA. Take it back and tell him he\u2019s getting nothing. You\u2019re never to be old to be an entitled brat apparently.", "ESH. Your dad is massively overreacting, it\u2019s just a bad gift, he should calm down. At his grown age he should have learned how to just accept a gift and shut up. \n\nOn the otherhand you\u2019re kind of a bad gift giver. Getting clothes randomly from a relative doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s okay with clothes from strangers nor that he wants something thrifted for his birthday. You just chose something you would personally like, which is kind of thoughtless. You mentioned your budget was $10 which in my opinion is still enough to find something for any hobby or taste. I think you\u2019re at an age where you can take a bit more of an effort to think about the other person.", "YTA - thrift store items are not for everyone and definitely should not be given as a gift. \n\nThink about it, it's literally an items someone else didn't want any more. It's someone's 'throw away' stuff. I'd be mad too if I got that for a birthday. \n\nAnd it's very understandable he sees it as unhygienic. It's more a mental thing. Yes it gets cleaned but there are some very nasty people in the world, and you don't know the previous (sweaty? unhygienic? smelly?) owner. Very different than a hand-me-down from a relative! So yeah, it's kinda gross. \n\nAlso, 'cheap' is a bad excuse. There are plenty of stores that have brand new cheap clothing. (15-25 dollar for shirt etc). We've all bought items that are not environmental or ethically 'right', so don't even use that as an excuse.", "NTA>Lots of clothes in old days  had bugs in them which made them pretty awful to deal with.  Not true any more.  Lots of people have dislike about used clothes.\n\nYour dad was seriously wrong!  He is supposed to show you how to get a gift and be kind.  He `failed.`", "YTA. I am all about buying stuff used for myself, but I would only give someone something used as a gift if they had told me explicitly that they were okay with used items. Obviously the hoodie isn't unsanitary as your dad believes, but many people would view a used item as a gift as being rude or disrespectful.", "YTA big time OP. It\u2019s one thing to buy second hand thing for yourself, it\u2019s entirely different to buy second hand item as gift.", "Nta but your dad is asshole", "I love thrifting. I donate tons of shit every year. Me and the gf get used puzzles. Yeah it's a bummer when they have 1 or 2 missing pieces. But you can donate them again when you're done. I rarely get lucky on clothes. Or records. But it's cool to check out. The one time I got a super nice ski jacket for 30 bucks. Left in my underground parking guest spot(gf takes the one secured spot) smashed window. Jacket gone. 6 dollars change gone. Like buddy. If ur cold I would have given you the jacket.

I feel that fabric can never be cleaned thoroughly the way that metal can.  I know it can be cleaned *well enough* and isn't dangerous, but it's still going to contain residue and be gross.  This has nothing to do with price - I would eat from a $1 aluminum fork but I wouldn't wear a fancy coat worth hundreds of dollars.

If you break it up it won't count / use NTA to show that the dad is the asshole.", "I know that wool items may have bugs but it was not wool and it was in a very good condition.I probably should have said it was new and that I just washed it to avoid this situation.", "Most adults don't mind getting second-hand gifts, as long as it's not dirty or massively used. \n\nThe fact that you fit in the category of people that can afford all-new stuff always doesn't make it the only way of life valid.", "Your privilege is showing.", "As I said I don't have that much money to spend as I am still a student.I thought that this was a gift that would get some use instead of a generic cheap item.But my dad would agree with you on that.", "Ummmm no. His dad is the A. H. Even if you truly believe you shouldn't give second hand gifts, which is just a completely absurd generality because there are PLENTY of people who are fine with it (see majority of this thread), reacting with hostility is unnecessary and incredibly rude! If dad really doesn't feel comfortable wearing second-hand clothes, he should have pulled OP aside and privately explained it to him, \"hey, bud, thank you for the gift, but just so you know in the future, thrift store/second hand clothes kind of freak me out. So if you're low on funds, I'd love it if you just made me a card or washed my car or something instead, alright?\" But throwing a tantrum and getting others involved? Embarrassing and shaming your CHILD for not knowing something? Come on, man, you have to know that is shitty, ungrateful behavior. \n\nAnd even if dad truly finds it insulting (which again, soooo ungrateful and privileged, but regardless), his kid is - and this important - a KID; he's *learning* how to navigate the world, there's no reason to freak out at him for not knowing something nuanced like that. \n\nPersonally I'd be pumped if someone got me a solid find from a thrift store - a vintage tee or quality sweater tops a poorly made shirt that smells like chemicals from the dollar store every time.\n\nNTA, OP, not even close.", "He's the A H because he \"should have known??\" How?

Like a hand written card would be better than second hand clothes. Your intention is good, but from a receiver standpoint an unannounced second hand cloth as gift could easily be interpreted as disrespectful (and seriously culturally insensitive if you do that with international friends from nations that really emphasise on underlying message in every actions, like Japan for example). Giving second hand item as gifts should always be treated carefully, like even if that item had long ceased production in 1970s you would still have to at least communicate beforehand, make sure this particular item (not even category, that particular item) is to their liking before even buying it.

If you show up with such an item as gift without proper communication beforehand, the one getting it is entitled to be upset, this is actual decency to consider this factor.
