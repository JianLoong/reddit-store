The next week I was speaking to my sister, she\u2019s much older, we don\u2019t talk that often but she was in town and casually mentioned about Miami, and my ex. She blew up at me and said it was extremely inappropriate that the guy would invite me, his ex, to his wedding let alone I would join them for multiple days on their honeymoon. I explained everyone was fine with it and she should cool it. \n\nAnyway we had a huge fight and just saying how gross I was even though the guy and his wife and I enjoyed each others company.

Co-worker's son got married last year, the whole family spent that week together after the wedding.", "Agreed! The original idea behind a honeymoon was to give 2 young inexperienced people who were (usually)virgins time to be alone together & boink their brains out without having family members nearby, who would probably snicker & make ribald comments. It was a time meant to get them used to sex. \n\nRealistically how many newlywed couples are virgins today? Sex is not a new thing for them to have to get accustomed to. Yes the love is there but they no longer need to be isolated to share that love & make goo goo eyes at each other. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen honeymoons are much more active now. People are going to exotic places to explore & have new experiences that have nothing to do with sex. Look at how many couples that have a honeymoon registry so guests can buy them travel experiences as a gift. Couples are no longer locked in a hotel room for a week or 2 just having sex. \n\nWhich is my roundabout way of saying if OP is telling the story accurately & everyone was fine with it then why not? What\u2019s the difference between the new husband & wife spending a few days with an old friend or spending a few days on a cruise with people they just met? I think it\u2019s because OP used to date the husband that has everyone\u2019s knickers in a twist. \u201cOh no!!! So inappropriate!

Two adults who are thirty years old should hopefully be able to say NO if it wasn't something they wanted to do.

Esp if they dated, idc how long ago it was. That's just weird.", "Exactly. People act like everyone is programmed to immediately say \"no\" when something they don't like comes up but I struggled for years and years to properly stand up for myself because of growing up in an abusive home. The bride could have disliked the arrangement very much and felt out of place saying so.

Not something that really needs to be justified.", "That\u2019s just your assumption. I strongly believe that the OP would have no problem telling his friend if he did not want her on his honeymoon. I understand that people are often overly polite; but not when it comes to things like a honeymoon or other very personal situations.", "There\u2019s not much point to making a judgment unless we assume that the narrator is telling the truth.

A person\u2019s friends aren\u2019t on the chopping block for a relationship (unless they treat the new partner badly), and weddings always involve a shot of compromise, but that\u2019s not something you should have to wrestle with *on your honeymoon.*\n\nIt was kind of weird for OP to suggest it, unless she had a really good relationship with the bride and actually suspected it would be fine and not put her on the spot.

I give you the benefit of the doubt if A) you actually consider this guy as more of a friend and don't hold onto any delusions that dating him when you were kids is some big deal, and B) you weren't putting the bride in some weird position where she felt like she had to go along with hanging out with you or she'd look controlling.", "YTA\n\nAsking to join a couple on their honeymoon is a complete no-no and ALWAYS an AH move. \n\nIn this case you\u2019re saying they were okay with it, fine, but what if they weren\u2019t?

Like how the couple felt about this, what the relationship is like with the wife, why OP got \u201cespecially\u201d close to her ex during his period of engagement.. wether or not she invited herself. \n\nThere just needs to be more context. OP didn\u2019t give us that much information, and doesn\u2019t seem to respond to anyone. There isn\u2019t enough information to make a proper judgment, but for OP to not be TA: all **three** parties would\u2019ve needed to agree and have an equally good time, and OP would\u2019ve needed to have been invited instead of inviting herself. With the information we\u2019re given, you can\u2019t assume that it was a good time for the couple and you can\u2019t assume it was a bad time, there\u2019s no way of knowing how they felt. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to say no to people, especially if they\u2019re being pushy. \n\nTo me OP is TA because most couples would never be okay with someone tagging along on their honeymoon for **THREE** days, but OP sounded very pushy. She could\u2019ve joined them for dinner one night, but not for **three entire days**. That is intruding, inappropriate behavior. A honeymoon is about enjoying your love with your partner and having a relaxing time, fully focused on one another. \n\nNow of course, if the couple were fine with it and they all had a good time then that\u2019s great and OP is NTA, but until we have more information it\u2019s hard to make the proper judgment.", "Not really.

I could see maybe meeting up for lunch or something but spending \u201cthree days together\u201d on their honeymoon?", "Three days is a LOT, even if you\u2019re close to the couple.

There should be no \u201cproposal\u201d of joining them in the first place. The second OP asked, OP was TA.", "I also don't see where the couple was upset.

Like it's not up to her or the couple.", "We don't know that. She said nothing serious, so likely that isn't true.", "Nah my GF's ballroom dancing partner is her dad.

I danced Latin and Ballroom for years and at least from my experience it's not that common that the dance couples are a couple off the floor or sleep with each other.
