I explained everyone was fine with it and she should cool it. \n\nAnyway we had a huge fight and just saying how gross I was even though the guy and his wife and I enjoyed each others company.

It was a time meant to get them used to sex. \n\nRealistically how many newlywed couples are virgins today? Sex is not a new thing for them to have to get accustomed to. Yes the love is there but they no longer need to be isolated to share that love & make goo goo eyes at each other. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen honeymoons are much more active now. People are going to exotic places to explore & have new experiences that have nothing to do with sex. Look at how many couples that have a honeymoon registry so guests can buy them travel experiences as a gift. Couples are no longer locked in a hotel room for a week or 2 just having sex. \n\nWhich is my roundabout way of saying if OP is telling the story accurately & everyone was fine with it then why not? What\u2019s the difference between the new husband & wife spending a few days with an old friend or spending a few days on a cruise with people they just met? I think it\u2019s because OP used to date the husband that has everyone\u2019s knickers in a twist. \u201cOh no!!! So inappropriate! She obviously still wants him!\u201d \n\nNTA OP", "This is awfully judgmental. You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions that aren\u2019t there. Yes, the OP did did suggest it; but if the newlyweds didn\u2019t want her there, they would\u2019ve said so. \n\nIf there\u2019s ever a time for someone to draw boundaries, it\u2019s on their honeymoon. So I have a very difficult time believing that the groom would not have told the OP to back off unless he was cool with everything.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My in-laws gifted us the use of their timeshare for our honeymoon, which was kind and very much appreciated. Then my MIL suggested that since it was a 2 bedroom condo, they accompany us so they could show us the sights...\n\nFortunately, my FIL shot that down.", "Hopefully, two 30-year-old adults would easily be able to simply say \"no\" if it was something they didn't want to do. Since they obviously said \"yes\", I would assume it was something they wanted to do and enjoyed.", "Specifically someone who used to f*ck your husband....", "I mean, OP called and they could have ignored the call, even, if they were that mortified by it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "why are u assuming tho? Do you know the couple \ud83d\udc80?", "In what world is that a bizarre reaction to crashing someone's honeymoon? Take the \"ex\" factor out of it; whether OP is a sister, cousin, coworker, or friend, it's really, really fucking weird and rude to have inserted themselves in this.", "Although I don't think I personally would ever ask someone to join them on their honeymoon, especially an ex, people are different. Two adults who are thirty years old should hopefully be able to say NO if it wasn't something they wanted to do. Since they clearly both said YES to it, one can assume it was something that they wanted to do.\n\nIf they are so spineless that they said yes to something like this \"just to be nice\", I fail to see how that is OP's problem.", "I'd be mad as hell if my partner wanted to hang out with someone else during our honeymoon lol. Esp if they dated, idc how long ago it was. That's just weird.", "Exactly. People act like everyone is programmed to immediately say \"no\" when something they don't like comes up but I struggled for years and years to properly stand up for myself because of growing up in an abusive home. The bride could have disliked the arrangement very much and felt out of place saying so. It can be intimidating to feel like you're putting your partner in a place to choose between yourself or the lifelong bestie, or something she didn't protest to avoid wedding drama.", "Don't forget, they are also ballroom dancing partners.... This is highly sus to me", "They didn't \"get especially close during the engagement\" as you put it, they \"remained friends for years after and especially through his engagement\" which isn't the same thing at all. Let's stick to whether OP is actually an AH in the real story and not debate whether they're an AH in your twisted, pot-stirring misrepresentation of the situation, ok buddy?", "Honestly what is a honeymoon anymore. Ex from high school, no big deal. I would like to assume they all get along. If everyone was cool NAH. Men and women can be friends, and not everyone has a jealous streak.\n\nEdit: Tense", "I was gonna say this! Like a lunch or something? But tagging along for three days sounds strange. And I feel like they might not know how to say no", "Because OP invited herself under the weak coincidence of \"oh how wild we'll be in the EXACT SAME CITY AT THE EXACT SAME TIME WATTA COINKYDINK! Oh, the \"friend\" I'm visiting? No, I can totally just shave three days off spending time with them to ENJOY YOUR HONEYMOON WITH YOU!!!\"\n\nYaaaay girl besties. No bigger red flag in the world.", "Because there's a strong chance they were just being polite.  Even if they weren't, better for OP to err on the side of caution since it's their honeymoon.", "According to OP. Are we sure she's a reliable narrator", "They never should have been put in that position.", "Lmao fair enough. I meant it in more of a, I don\u2019t know of anywhere that would think that\u2019s normal, most honeymoons are taken with your new spouse, not a third wheel especially an ex\n\nBut you made me laugh I pictured you grasping your pearls while you said it", "They posted on a public forum asking everyone\u2019s opinion\u2026on doing exactly that\u2026are you new here? Does someone need to explain it to you? When you post on the internet and ask people questions, it turns it into their business. If you don\u2019t want people butting in\u2026 don\u2019t post it on the internet", "How did the trip go? Was it weird for him? And more importantly is the couple still married? Lol", "Exactly maybe it was just 3 people wandering Miami and drinking. Some people like having a group.", "Oh good god. Thank you, FIL. I hope she didn't keep up with that kind of oblivious boundary shattering!", "Yep. I don't care that they dated in high school. If his dick was in her at one point, she's not welcome within a mile of our relationship.\n\nAnd ballroom dancing as their friend activity? Yeah, this pickme is going to blow their relationship out of the water and then come back here wondering if she's TA for that too.", "The sister is a 3rd party. I find it bizarre that she has such a strong reaction to something she wasn't involved in. Especially if, as described, the honeymooners were OK with the whole thing.  \nNow, if the bride had thrown a fit, that would be a different story.", "It\u2019s the principle of the thing. Why would you ask to hang out if they explicitly told you \u201coh we\u2019re going to Miami for our honeymoon.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. If I were an ex and I was invited to my exes wedding and I actually decided to go, why in the heck would I invite myself to hang out with him and his new wife knowing that they are going on a honeymoon, just because we are going to be in the same city.", "Agreed! I would be on the phone with the divorce lawyer real quick. I don\u2019t even care if it was my wedding day. It would be a no for me. I could not trust him at all after that. Just imagine a guy having the audacity to invite the ex to the wedding and the honeymoon.", "I mean, you're married to the guy.  No time like the present to start sharing your actual feelings...", "It is an issue, though. Why does she need to say that her and her ex stayed close, especially during the engagement? Why did they need to be that close, and why does she feel its important to make that point? She's an EX. Let them have a relationship of their own. Pertinent information when you're talking about someone who overstepped their bounds.\n\nFor someone who's saying that I'm stirring the pot, you really attracted attention to my comment. Way more aggressively than necessary, btw. \n\nNot your buddy, friend.", "Lol a honeymoon is still a pretty clear cut thing to me where it\u2019s two married partners going on a vacation to celebrate their marriage but I suppose I could be out of the loop", "And she says she had a great time. I think OP didn't noticed if the newlyweds were having a good time or not.", "So what? The husband could\u2019ve easily said no. A honeymoon has a built-in exclusion factor to it. Not something that really needs to be justified.", "That\u2019s just your assumption. I strongly believe that the OP would have no problem telling his friend if he did not want her on his honeymoon. I understand that people are often overly polite; but not when it comes to things like a honeymoon or other very personal situations.", "There\u2019s not much point to making a judgment unless we assume that the narrator is telling the truth. I mean; if we want to go down that road, it\u2019s possible that there is no wedding couple.\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s kind of intellectually dishonest to start acting like the narrator may not be telling the truth. Not without some sort of a evidentiary basis.", "I agree. OP should have suggested nothing other than \"let's get lunch if you're interested!\" And left it at that.", "Exactly.  They seem nice and didn't know how to say no.", "I was clutching my pearls and wondering who would think of the children lol.", "Are you new here? You gave a judgment and did not give a reason except for the fact that it\u2019s something that you personally don\u2019t like to do.", "They are! He was really close with his cousin and got invited, so of course he went. I am not a romantic type so the whole Wedding/Honeymoon thing seems like something I would use the money to buy a house kind of thing", "I'd probably have a similar reaction if one of my sisters did something so gauche. If this were a situation where the couple had made the suggestion, I'd have no issues, but OP inserted herself...under the guise of visiting a friend at the same time in the same city? Miami isn't exactly tiny -how great are the odds they were going to the exact same place? And oh, yeah, they're going to visit a friend but just shave three days off that reunion to chill with a couple whose wedding she attended while they're awaiting their cruise departure? Mmmhmm there's no weirdness there at all, not even a hint of it.", "Like I said, people are different. It's fine that you would never ask this. I would never ask this either. But if everyone involved was a happy and willing participant,  I fail to see how it makes OP an AH in any way.", "I agree! The situation is so so weird even if the couple went along with it? I\u2019m so shocked that OP can\u2019t see how odd it is on a surface level to invite yourself to hangout with somebody you used to date...on their honeymoon..for not one but THREE days!!! Holy crap.", ">Why does she need to say that her and her ex stayed close. Why did they need to be that close, and why does she feel its important to make that point?\n\nShe literally didn't, those are your words. She just said 'remained friends' so why are you inventing extra drama to inject into this story?", "I think the closeness of their relationship is relevant to whether she\u2019s an AH for accepting a wedding invitation and hanging out with ex and wife for a few days in Miami.  IMO, it leads more towards a NTA because it makes it more likely that she\u2019s also friends with the fianc\u00e9/wife throughout.", "I\u2019m not your friend, guy.", "Hahaha.", "You don\u2019t have to give a a reason\u2026And by me asking \u201cwho does that\u201d\u2026Is pretty apparent to anyone with a Atleast some common sense\u2026That I am effectively saying that\u2019s a weird and A-hole thing to do\u2026it\u2019s really not a difficult thing to figure out", "You'd honestly get into a \"huge fight\" with your sister over something like this?  It's not like she set their house on fire, or killed their dog. Worst case, OP was pushy and her friends are doormats who pretended to enjoy her company for three days. \n\nThat's not something I would, or could, get worked up over. I'm just not that emotionally invested in my siblings' social lives or faux pas.", "Ok you\u2019re right \u263a\ufe0f I think I\u2019m starting to see what you mean", "You are wrong it\u2019s literally in the second sentence OP says that they got especially close during the engagement", "But your judgment is not helpful unless you give a reason.  And I am aware that YOU don\u2019t agree with a third wheel on the honeymoon; but that doesn\u2019t automatically make the OP an AH.", "If one of my sisters were idiot enough to come to me with such a selfish and stupid account of their weekend, I certainly wouldn't sugarcoat my feedback. With friends like OP, who needs enemies or overbearing mothers-in-law? She'll be enough of a scourge to their lives all on her own.", "It does in my specific opinion, and I don\u2019t need to have a helpful answer. My answer is the same as 90% of the comments. This is not a help me sub. This is a judgement sub. My judgement is that he is in fact the asshole for third wheeling a honeymoon. I really don\u2019t need to explain any more than that", "It\u2019s absolutely a \u201chelp me\u201d sub. What do you think your judgment is? It\u2019s giving feedback on something the person already did.\n\nI don\u2019t care if 99.9% of the comments are like yours. Yours will get ignored because it has no explanation. Anyway, enjoy your day.", "Honest to God, I could not care even a little bit if some random person who thinks it\u2019s ok to third wheels on honeymoons reads my comment. Haha \n\nBut you have a good day too", "Lol are you ok dude?", "Why?"]}
