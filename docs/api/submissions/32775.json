We were supposed to go to lunch in a nice restaurant and then see a Christmas exhibition/light show. My boyfriend and I travelled together in his car.\r  \n\r  \nIn the restaurant he pulled out a gadget he has (not sure what it is called, I think a flipper?) - not sure what exactly it does but one of the things is sending signals to iphones and blocking them temporary because of a bug in the ios system. Most of our friends are iphone users and he has blocked their phones on multiple occasions but no one has ever been mad or anything. I have told him in private that he should stop doing it because everyone is annoyed and they have told him too. So he pulls the thingy out of his pocket, to which our friends are asking him to please don't. One of our girlfriends switched her phone off to which he said ''you know I can turn it back on, right''. When he wasn't looking my other friend took his gadget. She said he is going to get it back if he promises not to pull this crap again, otherwise he is getting it when we are out of the restaurant. It was all banter in a lightweight tone by that point. Now he started getting angry and trying to reach across the table to get it back. I told him to please sit down. He did and started yelling angrily at her to give it back immediately. I interfered and told him to please stop yelling as I was embarrassed having him yell at a quiet restaurant. He got even more angry, got up and stormed off. While he was putting his jacket on, I told him to please quit acting like a child and get back on the table.\r  \n\r  \nI went after him when he was already sitting in the car. I tried to talk to him and explain that she wasn't going to do anything to his gadget but she was just trying to prevent him from being annoying. I told him he is teasing them and joking with them all the time so it's unreasonable for him to get this mad when they pull the same on him. He said he is mad that I didn't say anything to her but in stead made him out to be the bad guy. I told him it was all so childish from both sides. I asked him to please not ruin my day as well because of that and to come back to the restaurant and got out of the car thinking he would follow. In stead, he drove off.  He was about to leave with my jacket in the middle of the winter and keys for home and my car (we don't live together) so I had to wave him down on the street to get them. I got so mad in the process that I slammed the car door. I feel like I further escalated the situation with my emotions. He hasn't reached out today at all and has stopped sharing his location. I feel like the whole situation is ridiculous but I also don't exactly know what I did to deserve him to be THAT mad at me. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1702236877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fbbxb/aita_27f_for_telling_my_boyfriend_35m_to_quit/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friends probably don\u2019t have the heart to tell you that they don\u2019t like your boyfriend. He\u2019s just way too immature.

There's absolutely no reason your bf needs to be taking this with you to meet up with your friends except to be a pain in the ass by disabling their phones. It basically causes a denial of service attack on their phones so it locks them up.  He thinks he's being \"cool\" by showing off his toy but he's not, he's become a tiring nuisance. On top of that he's treated you and your friends with disrespect. He's showing you who he is, now believe him and leave him. He's not responding because he thinks it's giving him the upper hand and he wants you to grovel and ask is forgiveness. YOU didn't do anything, he's the one that should be apologizing.", "NTA\n\n>  he has blocked their phones on multiple occasions but no one has ever been mad or anything.\n\nI would be. I'd tell him pretty clearly to stay away from my phone, and I promise you he'd get the message.", "Oh dear god. I hope he broke up with you right then and there. In the long run that would *absolutely* be the best thing for you. \n\nYou do not deserve any of this nonsense, and since you got your stuff out of his car, you have no reason to ever speak to him again. \n\nHopefully your friend group will jettison him as well. I can tell you if I got ahold of his wretched little device, I would have placed it on the floor and demonstrated my very best tap dance moves on it.

He can dish it out but he can't take it. At the least sign of resistance he throws a tantrum like a toddler. A controlling one with serious anger issues. Please reconsider this relationship.", "The fact that you feel you escalated the situation by slamming the door is concerning. You did nothing wrong. \n\nHe obviously has issues that he needs to address. Use his radio silence to carefully consider if you really want to keep dealing with his childish antics.

He sounds incredibly immature anyway, is that what you want? Your friend taking the device from him was the most gentle way of saying \"stop it\".

How is this funny even once? And he's 35! You had to stop him from driving away with your coat and keys.

If I were you, next time he blocks people's phone I would jump up, point him out to the biggest guy there and tell him that the boy has a mechanism that is attacking his iPhone. While the big guy is beating the absolute crap out of your ex I would move to the next table and pick up one of off duty firemen to continue the evening with", "NTA. He\u2019s too childish to be a boyfriend, and too annoying to be a friend. Your friends must really like you because I wouldn\u2019t want to spend any time with him.", "NTA why the fuck are you dating someone like this\u2026.?", "NTA. I got second hand embarrassment reading this. You need to break things up ASAP. He sounds like a nightmare and an embarrassment.", "NTA.", "He's a baby. \n\nHe has no justification for pranking people like that.", "NTA. This isn't about him being annoying or childish. This is about him being entitled & enjoying controlling others, while not being okay with his ability to control ppl being removed. He was acting far worse than most children. He's repeatedly shown a disregard for his friends, you, and the people in the vicinity. 15 other ppl chose to show normal healthy behavior when this happened. Not your guy. He's fine with with yelling at someone in a restaurant and abandoning his partner. Please free yourself to find a better more respectful partner.", "You have to turn your Bluetooth off he can\u2019t do nothing after that", "Yes you are the AH. Maybe not for the reason you think. In my opinion you are an AHole for staying with your boyfriend who is unquestionably an AH! When your group of 16 first found him jamming your phone signals, what did everyone say? He is over the top controlling and a childish piss ant. Good luck having kids with that roll model!", "A flipper  the hacking tool your bf is cool no netter what I say after  that pary", "He is cheating that why stopped sharing location trust me", "It\u2019s not the big its hacking tool that can hack aLOT OF THINGS", "NTA but your boyfriend is, and childish.  That might give people a chuckle to do it once but after that it\u2019s just really annoying.  If I was in the group I\u2019d be asking everyone else to not invite ya\u2019ll anymore.", "NTA, he IS acting like a child, and a hypocrite. \n\nI'd be extremely pissed if something thought messing with my phone was a funny prank, and continued to do that after being asked not to. Honestly in your friend's situation I would have smashed the gadget. What gives him the right to mess with other people's devices?", "He's a child and needs to grow up. Does he have some kind of social disorder where he thinks it's funny to do this crap?", "NTA - but do you really want to date a 5 year old that throws temper tantrums?", "There is a very large age gap that I am concerned about, like 8 years?!", "NTA\n\nWhy does he think he has the right to interfere with other people's tech, but they can't interfere with his?", "NTA. 35 year olds who act like that are not partner material. Cut your losses and walk, he\u2019s not done being a petulant teenager yet.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is just a loser.", "No, not at all actually. I am considering breaking up with him after that because it is just the cherry on top of his childish behaviour both in private and and in public.", "They were amused the first time - after that it was straight up annoying. We have been in that friend group way before we got together, so it's not that don't like him but there are deffinetely some behaviours they find extremely annoying. They all invite each other to couple dinners 2 by 2 but no one except from one invites us and I have realised that long time ago and know why. It's sad and embarassing to be honest. I have been reconsidering the relationship for a while. Thank you!", "Moonwalk over that shit I think they might be harder to get since they tribto make them illegal", "Holy moly. That's really not something that should be legal to use on other people's devices.", "its not funny one time. if i go in your basement during a party and pull the main breaker cutting off your electricity, hows that funny?", "I have no idea. Others here seem to have more knowedge than me so may be someone would explain better.", "Thank you! He has told them that (I have a samsung so it doesn't affect me) but as most have Apple watches or similar, is annoying to have to switch Bluetooth off just because of him.", "If he is out cheating because I didn't tolerate his childish behavious yet another time, he is free to do just that and be gone afterwards.", "Good for you. Don\u2019t wait, move on. You deserve a grown man.", "You don't need to support an immature 35 year old.", "His need for the gadget and his apparent arousal from the control the gadget creates is concerning on multiple levels.", "Why were you letting a juvenile bang you?\n\nThis guy is clearly extremely immature.", "Sounds like you should.", "Yeah, it's not.", "Yeah, I would honestly be surprised if this man is house trained smh.\n\nThis stuff here is why there is an ethics class in computer science degrees.", "a grown PERSON. this is 2023. please be respectful."]}
