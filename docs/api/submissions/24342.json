Their children decided the best place for them is an assisted living facility. They started to look into different facilities and admittedly, I didn\u2019t help because I figured the 5 adult siblings could handle it and I was never close to my in-laws. They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month.\n\nI immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk\u2019s parents. She then told me that we\u2019re going to cover the lion\u2019s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it\u2019s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it\u2019s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents\u2019 safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can\u2019t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled,\n\n\u201cwe don\u2019t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom. I know as a married couple I shouldn\u2019t consider \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cyours\u201d income but realistically I do make more than all of them and I think it\u2019s unfair to make me pay the largest portion.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nUpdate\n\nI\u2019m going to answer some questions.\n\n1. I assumed it was $25,000 a month because I assumed it was split 5 ways between the siblings and our share was $5,000 a month. It\u2019ll be closer to $10,000 a month and our share is $5,000.\n\n2. Her parents have assets including a house so I was told they don\u2019t qualify for government assistance. I brought up the idea of selling their house but was shot down immediately. The siblings want to keep the house in the family because their great grandfather built it or something.\n\n3. I can afford to pay it but I don\u2019t want to based on principle. Their division means I\u2019ll be paying $5,000 a month while the youngest brother will be paying only $300 a month and will be living in the house. Their thinking is that he\u2019ll be paying the insurance and taxes on the house so he can\u2019t afford more than $300.", "created_utc": 1691688130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nij3x/aita_for_telling_my_wife_were_not_going_to_pay/", "score": 1767, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And this assisted living is a non-profit, so just imagine what some of the for profit ones charge.  This is going to be an ugly conversation, and you shouldn't have yelled, but there is no reason for you to be paying significantly more than the other siblings.", "Nta. They are their parents.

Every year as the parents need more help, the cost will go up.\n\nIf/when they are put into a nursing home, it is even more money.\n\nYou can not even be put on the list for government assistance until they are completely broke, so spend all their money until itnis exhausted, then get them on the list. The family will have to cover expenses until they actually get on the list, and the government assistance won't cover everything, so the family will still be paying a lot out of pocket, but it is better than paying for the whole thing.\n\nMake an appointment w/ you and your wife and siblings w/ a lawyer who specializes in elder care ASAP. They will tell you everything you need to know, inluding about the 5 year look-back for fovernment assistance and the things that you can spend money on (like pre-paying for a funeral vs. \"gifting\" assets) that will not bit you on the bum when the parents are finally eligible for assistance.", "NTA - other people do not get to decide how your family spends its money.

Might they need care?  Who pays for that?  Can Op afford both?\n* Do OP & his/her wife have children?  How would this financial responsibility impact them?\n* If the cost were split amongst the five siblings, how much would they be on the hook for?\n* Is this one of those situations where payment could reasonably be a percentage of salary?  E.g. if $5k is (I dunno), 20% of OP's salary, then can the siblings each contribute 20% of their salaries.\n* What assets are the parents bringing to this?  What are their pensions?\n* How much would in-home care cost?  As much as an assisted-living facility?\n\nIt doesn't sound as if the options had been properly assessed, and as if they'd all jumped to \"Assisted Living Facility because OP will cover most of it\" without thinking things through.  Back to the table, folks.", "NTA- if you\u2019re the only footing the bill, you have say in the facilities. That is insane that they expect you to foot the bill for their parents.

If you agree to this you are agreeing to it indefinitely, and if you ever needed the money, if you needed to help out your own parents, or if something came up, i bet the siblings would act like they are doing you a favor if you ask them to cover more a few years down the road.   \n\n\nI generally am in the camp of \"when you are married its not your money, its ours\", but, that doesn't give a spouse the right to decide on a massive financial commitment or purchase without the other person agreeing.", "NTA-Since it is family finances she does not get unilateral control and consent.  You have veto power and the ability to negotiate what portion you are willing to pay.  If you hit an impasse then you will hit the break point like now.  The ball is in her court whether to accept or file for divorce.", "Consult an elder law lawyer.  Depending on what state your in-laws live in, there may be a better option.", "NTA. Wow. This is a barrel of worms. It should have been discussed by the parents and at least semi-arrangements considered. Also by the parents and their children. And spouses. They didn't wake up suddenly \"old.\" \n\nThe wife doesn't get to make unilateral financial decisions and decide that her siblings can coast on her husband's income. What about husband's parents? It sounds as if some of the children other than OP's wife have spouses? What happens when they need care and what they can afford is already being spent ? Also, emergencies happen - long term illness, etc. If someone needs to cover the needs of their immediate family, newborns, etc., where does that money come from if they all are paying the max they can afford for one spouse's parents?\n\n What are the parents covering? They should have some kind of retirement plan or at least retirement savings, social security, pension, whatever to help cover some of these costs. If they were living in a house, there would be a profit selling. If renting, what they were using to pay rent without help should be going toward it. If they are destitute, Medicaid should be investigated. \n\nThis \"agreement\" was poorly thought out, and there definitely needs to be more research put in other than finding a \"wonderful\" place.", "NTA - I assume you are the breadwinner here, if she is going to commit to a large financial expense every month, at the very least you need to agree to it. If you guys can\u2019t agree and she is determined to do this than she needs to look at her employment options.\nSplitting 5 ways seems more than fair.", "If you are paying 5k and say the other 4 siblings pony up only 5k combined.  10k a month is top of the line, luxury assisted living.  What about the parent's contribution?  Surely someone who is going into multimillionaire class assisted living has assets?  What about their million dollar home and 2 million in investments?  Sell the home and use the money from this and investments to pay for the assisted living.  I can guarantee that when the parents die these assets will be 80% to the other 4 siblings.", "NTA- They refuse to sell a house but want your family to pay half? Fuck no I would die on this hill. They don\u2019t need the house , when shit gets tight you have to let go of things.", "NTA. \n\nIf there are 5 siblings it should be divided equally between the 5.

Your reaction was not great but justified. A marriage is a partnership, and that should be both ways. Your wife did not include you before committing to paying so much. \n\nBudget should have been settled before they even began looking at places. If a suitable place could not be found within the budget after assessing all sibling contributions, parents\u2019 assets, and whatever assistance might be out there then the arrangement expectations have to change.", "Sorry, NTA. I agree with you to the extent that if you are going to spend money on something, you have a say in what is selected upfront. It's an investment.

It sounds to me that you are being take advantage of.", "NTA it is not you and your wife's responsibility to fund this *at all* nevermind most of it. Do the parents have any savings? Did they plan for this at all?

You should not be expected to pay the most because of it\u2026 (it\u2019s their parents) if they can\u2019t afford a place for them- than maybe one of the siblings needs to move in with them and help them out\u2026 Not The Ass! Your wife is wrong to make an agreement with her siblings like that and than EXPECT YOU to cover their care\u2026 NTA, show your wife this thread.", "NTA it's not your fault your wife's parents failed to plan for old age. Not your responsibility to cover for their care. If your wife wants to pay she can get a better job and pay the 5k a month out of HER paycheck.\n\n\nKids are not retirement plans.", "NTA.  She shouldn't be volunteering your money for you when it is such a high cost.  5k/month without even discussing it with you?  Nah.  \n\nThe 5 siblings should be figuring this out without telling you to just pay it for them.", "NTA.  Your wife just decided it was okay to decide this huge decision for you.  Well, it's not okay.  You both need to be on board.  Don't her parents have assets that can go to their care costs?  Perhaps speaking to an elder care attorney is the best option for how to proceed.  Because she made this decision herself, now you look the bad guy, but you're not.  Your wife messed up here.", "NTA\n\nThe path for her parents is to sell the house and liquidate assets, then use Medicare for coverage. It's unfortunate that they didn't protect the house before they needed assisted living, but that ship has sailed - they do a 7 year lookback.

If you still are willing to help, then tell them a number you are willing to pay and that's it.  They have to find the  rest of the money or lower their standards.

There are good in home care options that would be lots less expensive", "I would bet money the kids are planning on splitting up the assets like the house etc.  That is why op is expected to pay for hospice.", "Info - are you in the US? More specifically if yes, are they on Medicaid or Medicare? If they truly can\u2019t live by themselves Medicaid covers home health services and nursing facility care. If they truly can\u2019t live by themselves makes me wonder if they would qualify for nursing facility care under Medicaid. Granted that likely another uncomfortable conversation to be had. But damn that\u2019s a hell of a lot of money you are expected to spend every month.\n\nETA - for less money you could hire people to care for them at their home.", "Info- the $25k was based on the assumption that your $5k contribution was being matched by her other siblings, but then you say that actually your $5k contribution is the lion's share. So how much is it actually each month? Because a lot of these judgements are citing $25k a month but it sounds like that's incorrect.", "NTA, mostly. Yelling at your wife isn't the best look, but it does seem she was hiding the ball a bit on this.\n\nHere's where she's wrong though, and why I think you need to stand your ground: you're not her parents' child. When the will go to probate, are you getting a sixth? Or are her and all her siblings getting one fifth? Regardless of who is cut in, are they even divisions or based on how much the child contributed towards the parents during their lifetime?\n\nI'm guessing it's an even division between all the siblings, no accounting for who puts forth the most effort to house them in their old age because that's standard.\n\nWell, in that case, every sibling pays one-fifth. It doesn't matter if your wife is using your funds or not, or how much her siblings make. What's important is that your household is not contributing more than any of her siblings' households unless you're getting more of the estate or at least power of attorney or something over the elderly parents during their lifetime so your household controls the spending and the estate.\n\nCYA on this. It sounds like everyone needs to go sit down with an estate planner and you need to be firm you're contributing exactly whatever share her parents have willed to her, no more and no less.\n\nAlso, I don't think it matters how much money you make. If during the time my wife made more than me she was being taken for a ride by her siblings *and did not consult me on how much she was spending out of our budget* I would have been so angry. I'm assuming here your finances are entangled, btw, and that whatever she inherits would go to the both of you. If that's not the case, and it would be solely to her, and she would not let you touch it, I suggest you wipe your hands of everything and make her pay her share out of her own funds.", "NTA. Mostly.\n\nYou're right to be outraged at your wife volunteering you to pay the bulk of the costs. I can understand her wanting to help her sibs by kicking in more, but she should've discussed it with you first and suggested a more reasonable amount so that her siblings don't suffer but you also aren't picking up most of the tab.\n\nMaybe you could've handled it a bit better with her, but tempers can quickly rise when money is fought over", "NTA. That's awful lot of money. They're their parents and you were not even close with them. Either everyone pays equally or parents go to a facility where siblings can afford. 3rd option: A sibling can take the parents in and everyone pays their share. Much cheaper, definitely safer and one option none of them will choose. \n\nYou're a funny guy though, I'll give you that. :)", "Info: I'm curious what the actual total costs and comparative incomes are.\n\nI can see covering \"more\" if you earn more, but to me the lion's share means more than half, which seems ridiculous unless you are earning like $1 million per year.\n\nCan the split be proportional to income and come out as more of a fair split? You could even do it along take home pay lines instead of gross income to account for higher levels of taxes.", "Generally NTA. You probably could have said it slightly differently but you did make your point and weren't too offensive about it.\n\nI don't blame you for getting defensive being signed up involuntarily to cover your wife's parents' expenses without even being consulted.\n\n$5k post tax requires $7-8k gross every month. That's a sizable amount of money. If this argument goes on for much longer I would definitely consider taking your paycheck and diverting it to an account you solely control.", "NTA, your wife should have talked with you prior to agreeing to pay the lion share.", "NTA\n\nThe monthly budget for assisted living should whatever Medicare will kick in plus 5x what the least well off sibling/family can afford to contribute each month. Once that baseline is established the other siblings can determine how much more per month they can contribute to their parents care to raise the budget.\n\nThe house will probably need to be sold to help cover the costs of their care, Medicare has a lookback period, so it's best to start liquidating assets now rather than trying to do it later.", "Yeah this is break up worthy to me at least. I wouldn't bankrupt my family to pay for anyone's care.\n\nIf you are expected to pay the most, then you get to pick the place.\n\nNo way I would allow myself to be forced to pay 5k a month for anything.  They can't be serious. \n\nI have a great job in cybersecurity and I couldn't afford that.  Seriously 5k a month after paying all the bills? That is 60k a year.

I understand the logic of where she's coming from but it should be divided up based on what the children make, not children and their spouses.    \n\n\nIf they don't make enough, then I'm sorry but they need to lower their standards or one of them needs to become a full-time caregiver through one of those companies that trains family to become the paid caregiver.", "I\u2019ve never seen an assisted living facility that costs that much.

They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month.\n\nI immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk\u2019s parents. She then told me that we\u2019re going to cover the lion\u2019s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it\u2019s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it\u2019s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents\u2019 safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can\u2019t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled,\n\n\u201cwe don\u2019t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom.
