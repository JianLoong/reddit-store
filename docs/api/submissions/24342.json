{"id": 24342, "submission_id": "15nij3x", "title": "AITA for telling my wife we\u2019re not going to pay our fair share for her parents assisted living?", "selftext": "This whole situation has gotten way out of hand to the point everyone is yelling at everyone and I\u2019m sleeping in the guest bedroom.\n\nMy wife\u2019s parents are at the point in their lives where they can no longer live by themselves. Their children decided the best place for them is an assisted living facility. They started to look into different facilities and admittedly, I didn\u2019t help because I figured the 5 adult siblings could handle it and I was never close to my in-laws. They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month.\n\nI immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk\u2019s parents. She then told me that we\u2019re going to cover the lion\u2019s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it\u2019s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it\u2019s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents\u2019 safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can\u2019t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled,\n\n\u201cwe don\u2019t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom. I know as a married couple I shouldn\u2019t consider \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cyours\u201d income but realistically I do make more than all of them and I think it\u2019s unfair to make me pay the largest portion.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nUpdate\n\nI\u2019m going to answer some questions.\n\n1. I assumed it was $25,000 a month because I assumed it was split 5 ways between the siblings and our share was $5,000 a month. It\u2019ll be closer to $10,000 a month and our share is $5,000.\n\n2. Her parents have assets including a house so I was told they don\u2019t qualify for government assistance. I brought up the idea of selling their house but was shot down immediately. The siblings want to keep the house in the family because their great grandfather built it or something.\n\n3. I can afford to pay it but I don\u2019t want to based on principle. Their division means I\u2019ll be paying $5,000 a month while the youngest brother will be paying only $300 a month and will be living in the house. Their thinking is that he\u2019ll be paying the insurance and taxes on the house so he can\u2019t afford more than $300.\n\nAnother update \n\n4. I\u2019m the only child to my parents. While they planned out their retirement, they worked their entire lives to put me through school and supported me through several degrees. I will be solely responsible for and will make sure their remaining days will be comfortable.\n\n5. Per your suggestion, I asked my wife if we\u2019re going contribute this much money to her parents, how they\u2019re going to contribute to my parents when their time comes. She answered, \u201cdon\u2019t be an idiot, that\u2019s an entirely different situation.\u201d\n\n6. I don\u2019t want ownership of their house because it\u2019s very old and needs major work. I brought up the idea of selling the house again and it was shot down again. They\u2019re not budging on it.\n\n7. None of us know the laws and regulations when it comes to this so I finally got her to agree for us to sit down with an estate attorney. \n\n8. Unless I feel up to it, this is probably the last update. I feel completely emotionally drained. I always knew my parents would get old but I never thought about it.", "created_utc": 1691688130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nij3x/aita_for_telling_my_wife_were_not_going_to_pay/", "score": 8243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The family will have to cover expenses until they actually get on the list, and the government assistance won't cover everything, so the family will still be paying a lot out of pocket, but it is better than paying for the whole thing.\n\nMake an appointment w/ you and your wife and siblings w/ a lawyer who specializes in elder care ASAP. They will tell you everything you need to know, inluding about the 5 year look-back for fovernment assistance and the things that you can spend money on (like pre-paying for a funeral vs. \"gifting\" assets) that will not bit you on the bum when the parents are finally eligible for assistance.", "NTA - other people do not get to decide how your family spends its money.

How would this financial responsibility impact them?\n* If the cost were split amongst the five siblings, how much would they be on the hook for?\n* Is this one of those situations where payment could reasonably be a percentage of salary?  E.g. if $5k is (I dunno), 20% of OP's salary, then can the siblings each contribute 20% of their salaries.\n* What assets are the parents bringing to this?  What are their pensions?\n* How much would in-home care cost?

You have veto power and the ability to negotiate what portion you are willing to pay.  If you hit an impasse then you will hit the break point like now.

This is a barrel of worms. It should have been discussed by the parents and at least semi-arrangements considered. Also by the parents and their children. And spouses. They didn't wake up suddenly \"old.\" \n\nThe wife doesn't get to make unilateral financial decisions and decide that her siblings can coast on her husband's income. What about husband's parents? It sounds as if some of the children other than OP's wife have spouses? What happens when they need care and what they can afford is already being spent ? Also, emergencies happen - long term illness, etc. If someone needs to cover the needs of their immediate family, newborns, etc., where does that money come from if they all are paying the max they can afford for one spouse's parents?\n\n What are the parents covering? They should have some kind of retirement plan or at least retirement savings, social security, pension, whatever to help cover some of these costs. If they were living in a house, there would be a profit selling. If renting, what they were using to pay rent without help should be going toward it. If they are destitute, Medicaid should be investigated. \n\nThis \"agreement\" was poorly thought out, and there definitely needs to be more research put in other than finding a \"wonderful\" place.", "NTA - I assume you are the breadwinner here, if she is going to commit to a large financial expense every month, at the very least you need to agree to it.

Your reaction was not great but justified. A marriage is a partnership, and that should be both ways.

More specifically if yes, are they on Medicaid or Medicare? If they truly can\u2019t live by themselves Medicaid covers home health services and nursing facility care. If they truly can\u2019t live by themselves makes me wonder if they would qualify for nursing facility care under Medicaid. Granted that likely another uncomfortable conversation to be had.

So how much is it actually each month? Because a lot of these judgements are citing $25k a month but it sounds like that's incorrect.", "NTA, mostly. Yelling at your wife isn't the best look, but it does seem she was hiding the ball a bit on this.\n\nHere's where she's wrong though, and why I think you need to stand your ground: you're not her parents' child. When the will go to probate, are you getting a sixth? Or are her and all her siblings getting one fifth? Regardless of who is cut in, are they even divisions or based on how much the child contributed towards the parents during their lifetime?\n\nI'm guessing it's an even division between all the siblings, no accounting for who puts forth the most effort to house them in their old age because that's standard.\n\nWell, in that case, every sibling pays one-fifth. It doesn't matter if your wife is using your funds or not, or how much her siblings make. What's important is that your household is not contributing more than any of her siblings' households unless you're getting more of the estate or at least power of attorney or something over the elderly parents during their lifetime so your household controls the spending and the estate.\n\nCYA on this. It sounds like everyone needs to go sit down with an estate planner and you need to be firm you're contributing exactly whatever share her parents have willed to her, no more and no less.\n\nAlso, I don't think it matters how much money you make. If during the time my wife made more than me she was being taken for a ride by her siblings *and did not consult me on how much she was spending out of our budget* I would have been so angry. I'm assuming here your finances are entangled, btw, and that whatever she inherits would go to the both of you. If that's not the case, and it would be solely to her, and she would not let you touch it, I suggest you wipe your hands of everything and make her pay her share out of her own funds.", "NTA. Mostly.\n\nYou're right to be outraged at your wife volunteering you to pay the bulk of the costs. I can understand her wanting to help her sibs by kicking in more, but she should've discussed it with you first and suggested a more reasonable amount so that her siblings don't suffer but you also aren't picking up most of the tab.\n\nMaybe you could've handled it a bit better with her, but tempers can quickly rise when money is fought over", "NTA. That's awful lot of money. They're their parents and you were not even close with them. Either everyone pays equally or parents go to a facility where siblings can afford. 3rd option: A sibling can take the parents in and everyone pays their share. Much cheaper, definitely safer and one option none of them will choose. \n\nYou're a funny guy though, I'll give you that. :)", "Info: I'm curious what the actual total costs and comparative incomes are.\n\nI can see covering \"more\" if you earn more, but to me the lion's share means more than half, which seems ridiculous unless you are earning like $1 million per year.\n\nCan the split be proportional to income and come out as more of a fair split? You could even do it along take home pay lines instead of gross income to account for higher levels of taxes.", "Generally NTA. You probably could have said it slightly differently but you did make your point and weren't too offensive about it.\n\nI don't blame you for getting defensive being signed up involuntarily to cover your wife's parents' expenses without even being consulted.\n\n$5k post tax requires $7-8k gross every month. That's a sizable amount of money.

Once that baseline is established the other siblings can determine how much more per month they can contribute to their parents care to raise the budget.\n\nThe house will probably need to be sold to help cover the costs of their care, Medicare has a lookback period, so it's best to start liquidating assets now rather than trying to do it later.", "Yeah this is break up worthy to me at least. I wouldn't bankrupt my family to pay for anyone's care.\n\nIf you are expected to pay the most, then you get to pick the place.\n\nNo way I would allow myself to be forced to pay 5k a month for anything.  They can't be serious. \n\nI have a great job in cybersecurity and I couldn't afford that.  Seriously 5k a month after paying all the bills? That is 60k a year.

They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month.\n\nI immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk\u2019s parents. She then told me that we\u2019re going to cover the lion\u2019s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it\u2019s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it\u2019s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents\u2019 safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can\u2019t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled,\n\n\u201cwe don\u2019t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom.

What, one lives in it and all 5 contribute to the costs? Maybe if it were a shared vacation property and they all could afford it. Otherwise, it\u2019s a recipe for failure. The best would be one of them get a mortgage and buy out the other 4. Use the proceeds to play for care.", "My parents are going straight from our family home into a facility that starts with independent living that includes meals if they choose (they'll have a kitchenette as well)  to assisted living, all the way through memory care and hospice. Couples are kept together for as long as is wanted and safely possible. There are many facilities that offer increasing levels of assistance, though their's does offer a much wider range than most. \n\nIt is very expensive, but they planned for it. Both have parents who had Alzheimer's. They know that moving an Alzheimer's patient is essentially a death sentence and they want to be to not be a burden on us, and to not be seperated unless it's for the safety of the other.", "I don't get what OP's wife gets out of this. Is she just being manipulated? I have to assume she'd have more money if her husband kept that money than if she gets 1/5 of a house.", "Absolutely. I was fortunate that my mom could easily adapt to living entirely on her first floor. Once we reached the point that we had round the clock home healthcare aides, that was $3,500 / week. When she could no longer help move herself from wheelchair to toilet, I had to have 2 people at all times. That\u2019s $7,000 / week. And this was in 2016. So $10,000 / month would actually be cheaper.", "As someone who works in patient care at a hospital, I cannot agree with this recommendation more. So many times I family members put in the situation where they are making MASSIVE decisions on behalf of a loved one who is not able to make their own decisions and they\u2019re just guessing. \n\nDo the research, make YOUR wants known, get it in writing.", "Reverse mortgages are super predatory plus you have to be living in the house while it is active. Rent the house to cover the parents' living expenses.", "Is it just me or are our parents requiring care much younger than our grandparents? My mom was diagnosed with ALS when I was 24. My dad was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s when I was 30, months after my mom died. It seems like a lot of my peers are losing their parents young. It\u2019s devastating.", "I am living something similar right now and can tell you DO NOT DO THIS\u2026besides the resentment that will grown between you and your spouse which will damage your relationship it also doesn\u2019t make financial sense. If you want to keep the house buy if from the parents and they can use that money to pay for their care, or rent out the house at market value and use that money to determine what care can be given. But to subsidise both your in laws and your BIL because you earn more now is crazy cause at some point you will need to consider your retirement and care plans and will you sibling in laws be supporting you? And don\u2019t get me started on the house once the PILs die and then it gets split 5 ways because one of in-laws wants to buy their own house but all this time you have been subsidising everyone but they won\u2019t even consider that you guys should get more etc\u2026.", "He said it's $10k a month. That is an average or below average price for two people in assisted living.", "You can get a pretty sweet Ferrari for $5k a month in payments... see what the OP's wife would say if he up and just bought a Ferrari with a $5k a month payment for the next 5+ years. \n\nLike you, I guarantee she would absolutely lose her shit,", "In this particular case, I would call that an excuse and not a legitimate reason. If that's the case, their two options are sell the house and buy a single story or sell the house and use it for assisted living. I don't care who built their house, you don't get to be sentimental when you're broke and facing real consequences. You also don't get to point fingers and call someone else selfish because you didn't buy long term care insurance when you had the chance. It sounds like OP is being asked to buy his siblings in law a house under the guise of paying for elderly care", "This. Even with a lease in place, all it takes is for the tenant-sibling (who is either insolvent, extremely entitled/enabled, or some combination to even get to this point) to stop paying. OP\u2019s wife will never evict her brother. And then OP is stuck with the house they didn\u2019t really want and 100% of the expenses of homeownership (mortgage, insurance, taxes, maintenance), while this brother lives there rent-free for as long as he likes - and there would still be the issue of the parents\u2019 ongoing care, which OP would likely be expected to cover anyway. \n\nOP needs to decide what costs s/he\u2019s willing and able to bear and under what circumstances, square that with the potential relationship outcomes, and get on with it. Maybe s/he decides the $5k/mo for the care as the lesser evil, but unless that was somehow a tiny fraction of my income, I\u2019d have a hard time getting comfortable with the knowledge that my spouse was willing to unilaterally commit $60k+/year to care for her parents and subsidize her brother living rent-free if she and her siblings are totally unwilling to contribute to the same causes using the assets at their disposal.", "> When her Dad passed, it turned out that everything he had went to her brother. All of it, 100%. For no other reason than that he is the son and that's their culture.\n\nBut I bet they didn't give her dowry when you guys got married? Funny, isn't it, how the bits of traditional cultures that benefited women were the first bits to go.", "His situation isn't relevant to their interests - they just want to make sure their inheritance is intact when they get it. I don't know how much OP is earning, but 5k a month is so much, that's 60k a year! That's a liveable wage (in most places)! If his parents need to live in a similar place, and he doesn't have any siblings, that's 120k a year! This seems like so much. \n\nIf they can't get any government assistance because they own a house, that house needs to be sold, so that the money can be used for this, and then when that money is gone, government assistance might be available."]}
