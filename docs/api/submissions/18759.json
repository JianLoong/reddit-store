She has a very interesting nordic last name, and she was clear from the get-go that she wants to keep her last name. She has a very close, special bond with her parents, and she is one of the last in her family to have her last name. There is only one man in her family with the last name and he is proudly childfree. \n\nI have a rocky relationship with my parents. I don\u2019t want to say anything bad about them because I love them to death, but things have not always been good. Since I started dating Nicole, I saw her relationship with her parents and she encouraged me to spend more time with mine. So, it has improved within the past few years because I see them frequently and keep them updated with my life.\n\nI am the last male with my last name. My fianc\u00e9e is the last child-bearing age person with her last name. (We aren\u2019t planning on kids right now but it\u2019s the fact that we are both the last to possibly pass the name along) I decided, because I felt it was important that we shared a last name, that I would take her last name. She and her family were surprised and honored and told me they would support my decisions no matter what.\n\nMy parents found out that I was changing my last name in an inopportune way prior to me sitting them down to talk about it. It did not go over well and my dad refused to speak to me for a week. My mom would send incoherent texts begging and pleading me to not change my last name, saying things like \u201cin our culture, men keep their last names. You can\u2019t just change your last name\u201d and that it was disrespectful and I had forsaken my family, and that I was destroying the family by changing my last name. She also said that her future grandkids \u201cdeserve the name <my German last name>. This is just so wrong! Please. Please. Please don\u2019t do it\u201d \n\nThere are many vitriolic, sexist, and unhinged texts, but those are just a few examples of things she said. my dad and her refuse to understand that I am a grown adult and they are now essentially disowning me and in inviting me from any family events in the future, like my sister\u2019s graduation party or a family trip that is already planned and paid for. \n\nFor context, I am a white American man, so the culture she is referring to is white American culture I think.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for taking my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s last name?", "created_utc": 1685680653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y33t0/aita_for_taking_my_future_wifes_last_name/", "score": 1546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can understand some mild dismay about your family's name effectively being cut off, as it's important to your family for the same reason it's important to your fianc\u00e9e, but the way they're reacting is downright childish. A name matters, but not nearly as much as the time you spend with your family. They care so deeply about their grandkid's name, but in disinviting you from family events, they seemingly don't care about seeing their actual grandkids.\n\nHonestly their reaction might validate your decision even further to split from the family name if this is what the family name stands for.", "NTA. \n\n>My mom would send incoherent texts begging and pleading me to not change my last name\n\nDid she change her name?\n\n>I had forsaken my family, and that I was destroying the family by changing my last name.\n\nDoes she think that this is an opera? She needs to calm down.", "Omg NTA, and quite the opposite. You are taking a stand against traditional gender roles and that is to be applauded.", "NTA. Your marriage, your name, your decision. If it pleases you and your future wife for you to take her name, then by all means do it.", "NTA, you wouldn't be the asshole if you changed your last name for no good reason. It's just extra sweet that you want to have the same last name as your lady.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a grown-up man and it's totally your decision. To be honest I think the whole passing the last name thing is ridiculous regarding the importance some people are giving to it. I mean the grandchild will be the grandchild of all the grandparents regardless of it's last name.\n\nEnglish is not my native language. We don't use Mr. and Mrs. And we also use our names reversed. Family name first followed by the \"first name\". \n\nInstead of Mrs. we traditionally use: -n\u00e9, but we have other options as well. E.g. One of the most common Hungarian last names is Kov\u00e1cs. A common first name is Istv\u00e1n. Let's say my name is Nagy \u00c1gnes. So if I was marring to a man called Kov\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1n I had planty of options.\n\n1. Kov\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1nn\u00e9 (was the absolute most common one back in the old days but it's considered outdated as the woman's name is actually not even mentioned) \n2. Kov\u00e1csn\u00e9 \u00c1gnes (still common) \n3. Kov\u00e1cs \u00c1gnes (used, but rarely) \n4. Nagy \u00c1gnes (rare in my country) \n5. Kov\u00e1csn\u00e9 Nagy \u00c1gnes (very common among younger couples) \n6. Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy \u00c1gnes or Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs \u00c1gnes (also very common these days) \n\nFor men:\n1. Kov\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1n (most common) \n2. Nagy Istv\u00e1n (rare) \n3. Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy Istv\u00e1n or Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs Istvan (becoming popular) \n\nIf my boyfriend had a last name that for some reason was not a good option I also wanted my future child to carry on my last name as that is perfectly normal and easy to use, yet not so common and was the last name of one of our most famous kings.\n\nI personally would prefer the Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy \u00c1gnes or the Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs \u00c1gnes but sadly our real last names don't match. So I am gonna choose the form: Kov\u00e1csn\u00e9 dr. Nagy \u00c1gnes (as I am a lawyer). It shows that I am the wife of my husband but also preserves my original identity. If I choose that my husband has no other choice but to preserve his birth name however our children will still have planty of options. With the first name P\u00e9ter these are:\n\n1. Kov\u00e1cs P\u00e9ter\n2. Nagy P\u00e9ter\n3. Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy P\u00e9ter\n4. Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs P\u00e9ter\n\nI am really sorry that in the English speaking countries you have very limited options and that it raises tensions unnecessary.\n\nThe point is that it is a decision that is only up to you and your future wife.

My ethnicity is Eastern European and it'd be weird to be a 'Smith' all of a sudden...I have no ties to that name whatsoever. I'd sooner take my mum's maiden (surname) than my husband's name because I have more ties to the former. \n\nBut you do you and if you're happy, so be it.

I had been married before, twice, and they both took my last name, and I really didn\u2019t care. I told her I was unwilling to change my name, I like my name, and I\u2019ll never ask her to do something I\u2019m unwilling to do. \n\nThe whole last name thing is complete BS. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s not like you own this person now. It\u2019s so superficial, and really just needs to be based on what individuals are comfortable with. Good for you, OP, for being comfortable going against the grain.

I had a very rare last name, he had a common one, so it made sense. Why should the woman automaticly be expected to take her husbands name?

Let your family have their tantrum, and do what is right for you.", "100% NTA. Live your life how you want to.", "NTA. Your parents have a right to be irked by this but their attempts at bullying you into keeping your last name are ridiculously out of line.\n\nHave you considered just both keeping your names.

But that's not a reason not to carry the name you choose.", "I\u2019m kind of confused by your reasoning, but it\u2019s your name to do what you want with. NTA. As a matter fact, you probably should change it. Your parents sound pretty shitty. No reason to continue the name.", "NTA, you're an adult, and it's white American culture to get disowned by your family for a stupid reason and/or cut them out of your life completely because they can't respect boundaries and act like adults.

Would they be all dramatic about them changing their name?\n\nAlso, they can't be so obsessed with passing one name on without seeing that another name has the same \"right\" to be passed on. And since your mother clearly wasn't born with the name, she needs to chill.\n\nHell, I know a couple who both changed their name into an amalgamation of both their names (Imagine his was Stark and her's was Romanov, they both became Starkanov). I also know a couple who each kept their own names, but their children got the amalgamation. In both cases, neither set of grandparents passed their name on.", "NTA\n\nThat seems super cool. You are literally the first person I have ever heard of doing this.", "Nta. Your parents sound unhinged, it's rare a man takes the last name of his wife.

Whilst they can't control your decision, you also can't force them to be happy with it and if you want a good relationship with them moving forwards and you should consider that this choice is *permanent* and therefore might be an ongoing problem for your relationship with them that they find difficult to get over.\n\nThere are some options; double-barrelled surnames e.g. Helvig-Schmidt/Helvig Schmidt are not uncommon and I think they get a bad rap, they were traditionally used amongst the nobility precisely to prevent names from going extinct because the new family would inherit both of the named family estates (they also became popular later as a way to \"mimic\" nobility.) You can pick whichever order you like and use a space or a hyphen.\n\nYou're actually allowed to modify your surname in pretty much any way you like when you get married, even going so far as to created a \"meshed\" name e.g. Schmelvig, if you feel so inclined.\n\nFinally, if you don't want an official double-barreled surname, you can also use one of your names as middle name. This one is nice because whilst it's technically not a double barrelled surname, it looks like one and it still appears in the full initials. However, I'm not sure that you can officially change your middle names when getting married by default, so you may need to get them changed separately (which is an added cost.) You could also choose to just give your kids your maiden name as a middle name.\n\nFrom the situation, it sounds like it's mostly your fianc\u00e9e who is set on her keeping her surname, not her parents, and it's only you who wants to have the *same* name. Have you tried suggesting a double-barrelled surname? I think they might be receptive. You could say something like \"upon reflection I have realized that my parents feel it was rude that I chose to take your family name without their prior blessing when I am also the last person bearing my family name. I feel as though it might be more appropriate to use a double-barrelled surname in this situation and I was wondering if I could have your blessing to go back on my word. It is still very important to me that fianc\u00e9e and I will share the same surname.\" Just so long as you're willing to take a no from them, I think you'll be fine.

After a quick hand slap by myself and her daughter (who also took both of her husbands names) she got over it. \n\n I actually interacted with my father after and told him. He was extremely disappointed but understood. He had enough self-awareness for that, but nowhere near enough to rekindle the relationship. He died in 2018. I didn't see him. I only regret the hands we were dealt, but that was out of my control. \n\nIf you find or have a name you love, change it. It's amazing how different it felt/feels to have a name I fully embraced for myself and shed the emotional weight of the original.", "Go by your mother's pre-marriage name.", "That seems reasonable - what's the tradition for children's last names in your country if you don't mind saying?", "It\u2019s a wedding. Isn\u2019t \u201cMr and Mrs\u201d the whole reason for the gift?", "I just wish someone would tell me how disrespectful (and thoughtless) I am BEFORE I drop a significant amount of cash for their wedding gift.", "Oh definitely. I have a 5 letter last name that is spelt exactly how it sounds and people still can\u2019t spell it. This guys is literally the only way to spell it (that I know of) and it\u2019s never misunderstood when saying it. Think \u2018Black\u2019 but shorter and easier haha.", "*story of my life, with first and last*", "Absolutely. I changed my name when I got married from one that was never spelled OR pronounced correctly to one that is ALWAYS pronounced correctly but gets misspelled about 60% of the time, even when I have said the spelling aloud, because the person writing or typing it is so convinced they know how to spell this name that they just tune me out.", "Finnish is...interesting too.  Not even the same language group.  Alot of my Finnish ancestors took on the name of the farm they lived in, so that makes the family tree very interesting.\n\nFor added fun, my ancestors are from the Ostrobothnias - which means half of my Finnish cousins speak Swedish as their first language, and the ancestors from that side have Swedish names.\n\nChristmas Card time is fun!", "Now, if I substitute \u00e4 with ae in H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen though, I get 13 letters:  \nHaemaelaeinen", "I think bc so many times it's ONLY the woman who hyphenates.  So they still aren't the same last name.", "There is likely a lot more legal hoops to jump through to change your last name without a divorce decree (at least in the US). It was honestly easier to change my name with a marriage certificate than it was with my divorce decree.", "I think with something that involves as much paperwork and deliberate shifting of habits as a name change, \"I wish I had never changed this\" is VERY different from \"I want to change it back.\"", "It can depend on where the regret comes from. It it's \"I miss my old last name\" then sure another name change may fix that. If the regret is how name changes complicate things (ie new paperwork, changing your name everywhere you have an account, etc) then another name change is just more complication.", "I love my dad and we're very much not estranged so it's not a factor, but I think even if he wasn't in my life, my name is part of who I am. I've had it my entire life, I've made a career, I've earned degrees, I've bought property, all with this name. \n\nIt's obviously entirely up to the person changing their name - I have a friend who took her husband's name just because she's always hated her maiden name and how it sounds and that seems like a reasonable reason to me. I just hate that it's so expected and many people don't even question it.", ">I have a 5 letter last name\n\n>Think \u2018Black\u2019 but shorter\n\nThis amuses me. I get your point though.\n\n My last name (German) has 11 letters and is spelled the same as it is pronounced, yet there are way too many people (Germans) that a) take a look and don't know how to pronounce it because apparently reading is hard or b) hear it and don't know how to write it. Meanwhile every single time I rented a car in Ireland they took a glance at it and got it 99% perfect the first time. It's also a really, really rare name and because my parents have been doing genealogy for +30 years, I know how many other people have the same name. Meaning I can safely rule out that they've encountered it before.", "Only with daughters though and if some Icelandic forfather went and made his -son into a lastname, he would have used -son, not -dottir.", "Yeah, and when this happens her last name feels like an afterthought, and often isn't given to their kids.", "i know what dottir means, thanks. it was also literally just an example"]}
