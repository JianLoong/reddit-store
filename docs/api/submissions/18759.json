She has a very interesting nordic last name, and she was clear from the get-go that she wants to keep her last name. She has a very close, special bond with her parents, and she is one of the last in her family to have her last name. There is only one man in her family with the last name and he is proudly childfree. \n\nI have a rocky relationship with my parents. I don\u2019t want to say anything bad about them because I love them to death, but things have not always been good. Since I started dating Nicole, I saw her relationship with her parents and she encouraged me to spend more time with mine. So, it has improved within the past few years because I see them frequently and keep them updated with my life.\n\nI am the last male with my last name. My fianc\u00e9e is the last child-bearing age person with her last name. (We aren\u2019t planning on kids right now but it\u2019s the fact that we are both the last to possibly pass the name along) I decided, because I felt it was important that we shared a last name, that I would take her last name. She and her family were surprised and honored and told me they would support my decisions no matter what.\n\nMy parents found out that I was changing my last name in an inopportune way prior to me sitting them down to talk about it. It did not go over well and my dad refused to speak to me for a week. My mom would send incoherent texts begging and pleading me to not change my last name, saying things like \u201cin our culture, men keep their last names. You can\u2019t just change your last name\u201d and that it was disrespectful and I had forsaken my family, and that I was destroying the family by changing my last name. She also said that her future grandkids \u201cdeserve the name <my German last name>. This is just so wrong! Please. Please. Please don\u2019t do it\u201d \n\nThere are many vitriolic, sexist, and unhinged texts, but those are just a few examples of things she said. my dad and her refuse to understand that I am a grown adult and they are now essentially disowning me and in inviting me from any family events in the future, like my sister\u2019s graduation party or a family trip that is already planned and paid for. \n\nFor context, I am a white American man, so the culture she is referring to is white American culture I think.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for taking my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s last name?", "created_utc": 1685680653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y33t0/aita_for_taking_my_future_wifes_last_name/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents need to get over it, it's just a name.\n\n>There are many vitriolic, sexist, and unhinged texts\n\nThat's concerning. You might want to consider uninviting them from the wedding lest they decide to make a scene.", "NTA. At the end of the day, it's your decision, not your family's. I can understand some mild dismay about your family's name effectively being cut off, as it's important to your family for the same reason it's important to your fianc\u00e9e, but the way they're reacting is downright childish. A name matters, but not nearly as much as the time you spend with your family. They care so deeply about their grandkid's name, but in disinviting you from family events, they seemingly don't care about seeing their actual grandkids.\n\nHonestly their reaction might validate your decision even further to split from the family name if this is what the family name stands for.", "NTA. \n\n>My mom would send incoherent texts begging and pleading me to not change my last name\n\nDid she change her name?\n\n>I had forsaken my family, and that I was destroying the family by changing my last name.\n\nDoes she think that this is an opera? She needs to calm down.", "Omg NTA, and quite the opposite. You are taking a stand against traditional gender roles and that is to be applauded.", "NTA. Your marriage, your name, your decision. If it pleases you and your future wife for you to take her name, then by all means do it.", "NTA, you wouldn't be the asshole if you changed your last name for no good reason. It's just extra sweet that you want to have the same last name as your lady.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a grown-up man and it's totally your decision. To be honest I think the whole passing the last name thing is ridiculous regarding the importance some people are giving to it. I mean the grandchild will be the grandchild of all the grandparents regardless of it's last name.\n\nEnglish is not my native language. We don't use Mr. and Mrs. And we also use our names reversed. Family name first followed by the \"first name\". \n\nInstead of Mrs. we traditionally use: -n\u00e9, but we have other options as well. E.g. One of the most common Hungarian last names is Kov\u00e1cs. A common first name is Istv\u00e1n. Let's say my name is Nagy \u00c1gnes. So if I was marring to a man called Kov\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1n I had planty of options.\n\n1. Kov\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1nn\u00e9 (was the absolute most common one back in the old days but it's considered outdated as the woman's name is actually not even mentioned) \n2. Kov\u00e1csn\u00e9 \u00c1gnes (still common) \n3. Kov\u00e1cs \u00c1gnes (used, but rarely) \n4. Nagy \u00c1gnes (rare in my country) \n5. Kov\u00e1csn\u00e9 Nagy \u00c1gnes (very common among younger couples) \n6. Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy \u00c1gnes or Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs \u00c1gnes (also very common these days) \n\nFor men:\n1. Kov\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1n (most common) \n2. Nagy Istv\u00e1n (rare) \n3. Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy Istv\u00e1n or Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs Istvan (becoming popular) \n\nIf my boyfriend had a last name that for some reason was not a good option I also wanted my future child to carry on my last name as that is perfectly normal and easy to use, yet not so common and was the last name of one of our most famous kings.\n\nI personally would prefer the Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy \u00c1gnes or the Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs \u00c1gnes but sadly our real last names don't match. So I am gonna choose the form: Kov\u00e1csn\u00e9 dr. Nagy \u00c1gnes (as I am a lawyer). It shows that I am the wife of my husband but also preserves my original identity. If I choose that my husband has no other choice but to preserve his birth name however our children will still have planty of options. With the first name P\u00e9ter these are:\n\n1. Kov\u00e1cs P\u00e9ter\n2. Nagy P\u00e9ter\n3. Kov\u00e1cs-Nagy P\u00e9ter\n4. Nagy-Kov\u00e1cs P\u00e9ter\n\nI am really sorry that in the English speaking countries you have very limited options and that it raises tensions unnecessary.\n\nThe point is that it is a decision that is only up to you and your future wife. Be happy, have beautiful kids and don't give a shit what others think...\n\nNTA", "Ask your parents to tell you the full name of all four of their grandparents, first, middle and the beloved last name. I'm assuming they can't without looking it up. So, the importance of the family 'name', history, and culture is really nothing more than a male dominated tradition. And not one that they are really all that familiar with anyway.\n\nIf you think it's important to have the same name as your spouse, then NTA for making your own new family tradition. Congratulations OP.", "NTA\n\nF@#$ the patriarchy - Taylor Swift\n\nTell them that adults in your culture do whatever they want.\n\nBut also, you could hyphen it?", "NTA... unfortunately a lot of people are obsessed with knowing their name will go on after they are gone. \n\nAre your tickets/ hotel room in your name for the trip? Because they can't stop you if it is. Assuming it is I'd put passwords on everything to stop them from changing it. \n\nCongratulations on your marriage. I hope you have a wonderful life together.", "NTA.  This is your decision and if anything their reaction to try to control you and what you do proves to me why the relationship was rocky in the first place.  if you prefer and want to use your wife's name do it.", "I don't think anyone should change their surname - my mum didn't, I didn't and I don't expect my daughter will either. \n\nI guess I'd like to die with the same name I was born with...it also reflects my heritage. My ethnicity is Eastern European and it'd be weird to be a 'Smith' all of a sudden...I have no ties to that name whatsoever. I'd sooner take my mum's maiden (surname) than my husband's name because I have more ties to the former. \n\nBut you do you and if you're happy, so be it. I wouldn't argue this point with anyone, it's a personal choice.", "NTA. \n\nWhen my cousin got married, he hyphenated his last name with his wife\u2019s last name. I thought it was cute, but some people in my family judged heavily. \n\nWhen I married my current wife, I told her I didn\u2019t care about her taking my last name. I had been married before, twice, and they both took my last name, and I really didn\u2019t care. I told her I was unwilling to change my name, I like my name, and I\u2019ll never ask her to do something I\u2019m unwilling to do. \n\nThe whole last name thing is complete BS. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s not like you own this person now. It\u2019s so superficial, and really just needs to be based on what individuals are comfortable with. Good for you, OP, for being comfortable going against the grain. Tell your parents it doesn\u2019t matter, because if they keep acting like they are, they won\u2019t be in any future grandchildren\u2019s lives anyways so it doesn\u2019t matter what their last name is.", "My husband took my last name when we married. I had a very rare last name, he had a common one, so it made sense. Why should the woman automaticly be expected to take her husbands name? Just because things have been done a certain way, does not mean we have to keep doing it without thought or question.\n\nNTA. Let your family have their tantrum, and do what is right for you.", "100% NTA. Live your life how you want to.", "NTA. Your parents have a right to be irked by this but their attempts at bullying you into keeping your last name are ridiculously out of line.\n\nHave you considered just both keeping your names. This wouldn't really solve the long-term-problem of family lineage because you'd need to decide whose last name the kids would take. Is a double name an option perhaps?", "NTA it is you who will wear the name. So it is your choice. I can understand them having hurt feelings. But that's not a reason not to carry the name you choose.", "I\u2019m kind of confused by your reasoning, but it\u2019s your name to do what you want with. NTA. As a matter fact, you probably should change it. Your parents sound pretty shitty. No reason to continue the name.", "NTA, you're an adult, and it's white American culture to get disowned by your family for a stupid reason and/or cut them out of your life completely because they can't respect boundaries and act like adults. (Seriously I recall reading it was like 40% of people in their 20s-30s)", "Nope, NTA\nIf you're happy with taking her last name, everything is fine.", "NTA.\n\nWhat would have happened if they had all daughters? Would they be all dramatic about them changing their name?\n\nAlso, they can't be so obsessed with passing one name on without seeing that another name has the same \"right\" to be passed on. And since your mother clearly wasn't born with the name, she needs to chill.\n\nHell, I know a couple who both changed their name into an amalgamation of both their names (Imagine his was Stark and her's was Romanov, they both became Starkanov). I also know a couple who each kept their own names, but their children got the amalgamation. In both cases, neither set of grandparents passed their name on.", "NTA\n\nThat seems super cool. You are literally the first person I have ever heard of doing this.", "Nta. Your parents sound unhinged, it's rare a man takes the last name of his wife. I have heard of it and heard of couples having both last names, an example would be Yates-Jones.", "NTA\n\nYou have the  right to take whichever surname.\nThat culture refers to when women were property.\n\nIt's more accepted to take the surname that suits both partners, so do what you both want. Luckily I married a Spanish man, so surnames don't change.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to continue the bloodline of [your last name], OP.\n\nThe way your parents are reacting is ridiculous. Unless they change their behaviour/apologize for putting immense pressure on you, maybe re-think improving your relationship with them.", "Definitely NTA. I actually love that you are doing this.", "NAH. You can do whatever you like with your name. I just find it weird that you \u201clove your family to death\u201d but don\u2019t seem to understand where they\u2019re coming from. You clearly know the importance of last names, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be taking your wife\u2019s last name. So you really shouldn\u2019t be surprised that your family is not reacting happily. \n\nIt\u2019s your right to make the choice to take your wife\u2019s name. You just have to accept your family\u2019s reaction as a natural consequence. Because last names do matter, which is why the man taking the wife\u2019s name against tradition *usually* implies one of the following: \n1. They want to make a statement about feminism and equality \n2. The husband is marrying into a more powerful family, politically or economically \n3. The man wants to discard his family for his wife\u2019s family / loves his wife\u2019s family more than his family", "It does seem odd to me, but I\u2019m not sure why. Either way, NTA. You do you.", "This is only the second time I've ever heard of this. The last time they were unmarried.\n\nSorry, my vote is NAH.", "Ahahaha, Wow. YTA", "NTA, it\u2019s you\u2019re choice end of.
