Meanwhile, my 7-year-old cousin's birthday party was scheduled from 12:00 to 5:30. While waiting for my hangout time with Alex, I decided to help my aunt with the preparation, especially with the cake and cupcakes and setting up the snacks on the table. But honestly, the best part was spending time with my adorable little cousin. We were both super hyped up for his party.\n\nBut brooo the fact that absolutely nobody showed up for his party is fucking insane. He waited ALONE (not rly, I was there, but aside from me there was NONE of his friends) for a whole hour, and all the decorations, treats, and snacks were just sitting there untouched. Seeing him overwhelmed with negative emotions made me sad. I didn\u2019t want this day to be ruined for him so I took matters into my own hands and called up Alex and asked if we could go to the arcade earlier and bring my cousin along. We had an amazing time there and he ended up feeling so much better. When we returned home with my cousin tho, my mom and aunt were yelling at me, claiming that I had messed up??? They insisted that my cousin would have had a better time with family.\n\nLook, I get it. we would've all spent quality family time together. But in that moment, all I wanted was to ensure that my cousin's special day wasn't completely ruined. He had an absolute blast at the arcade, and I genuinely don't see how I'm the one in the wrong here.\n\n(Btw, my little cousin doesn\u2019t have many friends and he invited all the people he felt \u201ccomfortable\u201d with including his \u201cbest friends\u201d so you can just imagine how heartbroken he is.)\n\nSo like AITA???? Did I actually mess up by making my cousin tag along with me and my friend??\n\nEDIT:\n\nYes, I asked permission from an adult, I asked my mom if it was okay before leaving and she was. Totally fine with it and told me she\u2019d inform my aunt, however when I came back she switched up real fast and both of them started yelling at me.", "created_utc": 1688584966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rkkjv/aita_for_taking_my_little_cousin_out_with_me_and/", "score": 3931, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did all you could to change the narrative of what would be a birthday to forget, otherwise.  You created a good memory to replace the sadness that would follow him for a very long time.  \n\nSo sad your family didn\u2019t agree.  Make yourself a superhero avatar.  You are the best in humanity", "As somebody who went through exactly this, you\u2019re NTA. I still remember how depressing it was and how alone I felt. My mom and her friend took me out the next day and that helped but I will never forget the way that day made me feel.", "NTA\nYour poor little cousin! What a traumatic moment\u2026I think you did the right thing by distracting him and going to do something fun with his cool older cousin. I bet he\u2019ll never forget it!! \n\nThat said, I would have at least told the rest of the family coming :/  No offense to your family buuuuuut a family gathering isn\u2019t nearly as cool to a kid as what you did for him\u2026I\u2019d think they would see that. \n\nTake the hit from the family knowing you saved the day for a kid!", "NTA. The only thing wrong is not talking to other familymembers involved, just to let them know. (I would also have asked grown ups if I could get my friends over to celebrate and play with the kid even more) Keep being awesome with your cousin! You have created a key memory and hopefully a friend for life.", "NTA. You're a damn fine person.", "What you did was sweet but didn't you ask the Aunt if the cousin could go?", "I don't want to call you an AH because it was really really sweet to take it upon yourself to cheer your cousin up. BUT never ever *ever* take a small child somewhere without clearing it with their parent(s) first. Based on one of your other comments, your mom knew which is good but it's your responsibility to communicate with your aunt in this situation. \n\nThat said, I hope the adults can see this for the lovely gesture it was. Your cousin will certainly remember it!", "NTA. \n\nBUT did you ask his parent? If not, that was not okay.  Also, how long did you wait. My family is notoriously late so I give them a 90 minute window for parties lol", "INFO: Are your Mom and Aunt angry with you for anything other than insisting your cousin would have had a better time with family? What are all of their grievances for how things were handled after no one showed up?", "You asked permission to take the kid right?  Cause I can understand if there was a where did he go situation here.  So that\u2019s an answer I\u2019ll need to know before I vote.", "NTA at all. Unless you took him against his mother's wishes or without her knowing where he was (which then I still wouldn't say you're an AH, but poor judgment, as it may have caused his mom to panic), I don't see the issue. I can imagine how devastating it was for your cousin and I am sure hanging out with his cool big cousin and your friends made him feel a whole lot better. And sure, he may have had a good time with the whole family too but this is one of those situations where really, if the kid was happy and able to enjoy his birthday - and of course if his mom knew where he was and nothing dangerous happened - then you did the right thing. Letting him have a good day, despite everyone bailing on him, ought to be everyone's priority.", "NTA\n\nJust gotta suck up whatever stupid crap they're throwing at you.\n\nYou did a very good thing that your cousin will likely remember forever.", "NTA. \nBut im confused by \"he would have had a better time with his family\" what family? His mom and his aunt (your mom)? There was no mention of other family, or did they show up later? And if so, why did they show up more than an hoor after the party was supposed to start? \nMost importantly, your cousin had a good time. Next time ask the parents though, that was not the smartest move.", "NTA- But your mom sure is the AH for saying \"yes\" and then not backing you up when you came home.\n\nYou asked first before you took him. The fault lies with her.\n\nThat said, ask your aunt *directly* next time.", "NTA. Sounds like you're a compassionate and empathetic individual. These are traits to be proud of and you should continue to develop them. It sounds like mom maybe doing a little CYA here with her sister and you are the victim.", "Info. Did you ask an adult before you kidnapped your little cousin? I'd be pretty pissed too if my 7yr old disappeared with his cousin and no one talked to me", "NTA \n\nWhat you did was very kind and sweet and I\u2019m sure your cousin will remember the great time he had with you and your friend.", "No, you are no doubt his hero now.  You seem like a very kind and thoughtful human.", "Nta, more like the hero your cousin needed right then", "NTA\n\nYou are AWESOME.\n\nHow your mom is yelling at you instead of BEAMING with pride over how AMAZING her 16 year old is for showing COMPASSION AND CARE to a 7 year old blows my mind.", "NTA! you and your buddy are awesome dudes for taking him. \ud83d\ude0e Should have text his mom and made sure it was cool to take him just so she knows where he is at. The kid \ud83d\udcafhad his birthday saved by getting to hangout with his older cousin and his friend.", "NTA for doing something to make your cousin happier.\n\nSlightly TA for not asking his guardian permission to take him.\n\nOn a side note: who on earth schedules a 7 y.o. birthday party for 5.5 hours long?", "NTA. \n\nThat said, you should have spoken to his mom.  Your heart was in the right place, but your mom can't give you permission to take someone else's kid", "You stepped up in a way most guys your age wouldn't even consider. I dont even know you, and im proud of you, sir.", "Hahahaha NTA your mom is spineless. I would rely on her ever again. I am glad you did something for your little cousin", "NTA...in fact, whatever the opposite of TA is that's what you are.\n\nYou gave him a great memory which I have no doubt will stay with him for the rest of his life.  You did a wonderful thing.", "Wait, did you take this child without asking his parents?!\n\nEDIT: YTA.  You took a child from his home, on his birthday, without asking his parents.  No wonder you got chewed out.", "NTA\n\nYou did a great thing for your cousin and honestly were all very proud of you for being a great person\n\nWell done", "Bro what. You're an amazing cousin for taking the little guy out; few teenagers have the emotional intelligence to do something that kind. Your mom and aunt might be embarrassed or upset and are trying to deflect. Your mom especially might feel like she played a part in hurting her sister's feelings.\n\nIt's unkind of them. I hope they let it go, or thank you for making the day good. NTA, op, and good on you.", "I think this is the easiest NTA ever. Your cousin will remember this day for the rest of his life. No 7 year old wants to hang with their mom and aunt over going to an arcade with an older cousin.", "Your NTA at all, and my heart goes out to your cousin ! I feel his pain, my 11th birthday party was done at an ice skating rink, i invited my whole class cuz I (thought at least) that i was friends with everyone, minus one girl who i hated but still invited. Literally the only person that showed was the one girl I didnt like, and she only showed up cuz me and my mum had to go pick her up ourselves. Thankfully i had some family show up, and my \"adopted\" sister made sure i had a blast, but it broke my heart that not even my supposed best friend came. At least your cousin has you to give him an awesome time too !", "This is why kids parties should have RSVPs. I can't really pass judgement because I don't think your 100% in the clear because you didn't ask the parent of the child you took. Aunt may have had a backup plan and suddenly her kid was gone. Your heart was in the right place but next time ask the parent.", "NTA, your cousin would definitely rather go to the arcade with two cool older dudes than hang out with his family. He probably felt so special that he got to go with you.", "NTA, BRO! You are an absolute chad for what you did!", "NTA. You kept his birthday from being a horrible memory to one he will cherish. My daughter's pool party got rained out when she was about ten. I took her for her first mani pedi, which is what she remembers about that birthday.\n\nYou are your little cousin's new hero. :-)", "Who\u2019s day was it? Little cousin\u2026 you saved the day, bravo..", "If I was cousins mam I would not be happy that my child disappeared, but seeing as you had told your mother, everyone knew he was safe. He is lucky to have an older cousin so caring and I would love my little ones to have a relationship like that. NTA well done for making a little boy happy.", "Nta. Your mom threw you under a bus though", "No what you did here was awesome. NTA", "NTA your cousin will always remember how you turned the day around for him", "NTA. Your lil cousin is gonna remember this forever. Good job!", "Nope, NTA. You got permission to take him out, and he would have had a better time at the arcade than to be stuck at a party no one show up for, being reminded by the decorations and untouched food that no one showed up for his party", "NTA", "NTA, and the fact your mom switched up on you like that is crazy", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNo way a 7 year old would prefer to stay at home with a bunch of adults and the reminder that nobody showed up for his party. IDK why, but your aunt is trying to make this about what she wanted somehow, and your mom is an asshole for backtracking when she gave you permission to leave.\n\nYou're a great cousin.", "NTA - As long as someone in authority (your mom in this case) knew what was going on you were a tremendous cousin.  He will remember that day the rest of his life.  Your aunt and your mom really need to take a step back and look at this from your cousin's point of view not form their point of view. \n\nHigh five from me.  Nice job.", "Definitely NTA! You are a great person and an amazing cousin. They should both be thanking you for saving his birthday.", "NTA. You're a wonderful human, keep it up.", "If everyone had an awesome, caring cousin like you, the world would be a much better place.", "Nta- you did your little cousin a solid.", "YTA, your aunt was probably scared shitless.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yah, no. \nYou did right by your little cousin and dont let anyone tell you otherwise ^_^", "Then NTA. It sounds like your mom said yes assuming auntie would be chill then auntie wasn't chill so everyone is mad.

Bad judgment", "Mother was a AH - she agreed the nephew should do but when challenged by the mother, she made it all to be OP's fault. \n\nOP did almost everything right except for not asking the actual mother of the child. Glad the kid had a good b'day in the end.", "Yeah, I think this was probably way cooler for the little cousin. I mean, maybe he would have had fun with parents and aunt, but it would still have been painfully evident that this was his birthday party that no one attended. And that hurts. This arcade trip with OP took the focus off of the empty birthday party (which unfortunately, would be hard to ignore, even if the parents and aunt did their best to make it awesome) and made it into a really special day for the little dude. Not only he knows his family loves him and was there for him on his birthday, but he now has memories of hanging with the big kids...being *invited* to hang with them. I would have felt super cool at 7 years old if that were me.", "Yeaaa i know, but my aunt was busy in the kitchen so I just asked the nearest adult who wasn\u2019t really preoccupied,", "For sure NTA. But info: please tell me your cousin didn't hear your mom and aunt yelling at you about it. That would just make it so much worse.", "Listen op. You are really considerate and awesome person. And I get you are still underaged. But as you still need to (sometimes) ask your parents for permission, you definitely need to and little cousin\u2019s parents for their. Your mother is massive asshole in this, but her agreeing to this doesn\u2019t count. She would not ask permission, she would inform. She throw you under the bus. \nThat\u2019s a good lesson to you to remember to ask kids parents not yours. Aunt is rightfully angry. Let\u2019s see it firm her point of view. You took her kids out without asking her first. \nAt the end you are NTA (not really), but neither is your aunt. The only ah here is your mom. \nAnd personally I think you are a great person for caring about your cousin.", ">They insisted that my cousin would have had a better time with family.\n\nYou ARE family, and probably your little cousin's hero.

You are a good cousin.", "Nta at all I\u2019m sure he had way more fun with you guys", "Not all heroes wear capes my man. You did right by your cousin and saved him from a life changing humiliation. The right thing to do would be to ask an adult, then treat your cousin. You did that. The lil guy is lucky to have you.

Doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s how it went, so I think OP is a super nice person to try and cheer up their cousin. I guess it\u2019s a lesson in talking to the cousin\u2019s mom next time. NTA", "NTA. Your cousin will look back on this day many years from now and remember it fondly.", "Info: why didn't any of the adults go with you to the arcade?", "NAH you helped your cousin and gave him an amazing time, but I can not stress enough to inform HIS parent or guardian first.  Your mom can't give consent for someone she doesn't have responsibility for, I'm sorry she did not have your back but she probably panicked when she realized she told you you could kidnap your cousin. Which unfortunately is what this can be called, even with the best intentions. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, but you gotta ask for sure.", "NTA, Aww poor little dude. What you did was awesome and created a great memory of his birthday instead of a sad and traumatic one.", "NTA your cousin will remember this in a positive light for a long time", "NTA. You asked permission. Where was your aunt and why didn't you ask her, though.?\n\nIt was really kind of you to be so nice to a heartbroken little boy and your friend Alex is cool, too. Sorry to say this, Mom, but the child was a lot happier with the big kids at the arcade than he would have been at home with family. Staying home would have reminded him that his friends didn't show up. \n\nYour mom sucks for giving permission, then yelling at you.", "NTA, you did a great thing and it 100% was the right thing to do rather than be at home with the evidence of being let down all around the house. They would definitely have more fun hanging out with someone closer to their age in a situation like that. Your aunt shouldn't have snapped at you but I sympathize with the situation as I'm sure there was a mixture of guilt, sadness, fear from her son being somewhere without being informed and annoyance from paying money on a bunch of flakes. Hopefully with time your aunt comes around and thanks you for being a good cousin, and it sucks your mom made you the scapegoat when she didn't inform her sister", "NTA. Great way to love and support your cousin. \n\nNow, don't get angry or defensive with your mom and aunt. Talk to them calmly and with compassion, and I think you'll find sympathy (not agreement) for them.", "In hindsight, you probably should\u2019ve asked his mom. However, the fact that you took it upon yourself to make his day better speaks volumes about how much you love him and what a good kid you are. That little boy is lucky to have you.", "NTA.

The adults around you seemed to go \u2018ah well, we can just have a family get together\u2019 COMPLETELY IGNORING that this VERY SMALL CHILD. Was completely abandoned by friends on his birthday.

Just because your Mom was okay with you going off with YOUR friend, that does not mean your aunt was comfortable with a friend of yours, who she may not know, being around HER kid, driving him, or hanging out with him.

Also talk to your mom; let her know what you are feeling about her reaction and change of tone. It may not be a big deal, but it helps to at least mention that you are upset by this. She may give you added context you should know. At the very least it cannot hurt your relationship with either of them.\n\nGood Luck!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Adding the following as a PS-Do not apologize to your Mom.

As someone who has been there, you did the right thing.", "But also took a child out of their house without the express permission of the child's parent...", "Honestly, I try my absolute best when it comes to my little cousin, he sees me as a role model and admires me a lot, which makes me wanna become a better version of myself. It\u2019s thanks to the little guy I stopped doing many old, bad habits. The dude deserves the world fr", "Brooo bless your uncle, he\u2019s a real one.", "Twice??? That\u2019s fucked up.. I really hope you recovered from that, no one, especially a kid deserves to go through that", "Woah what, I didn\u2019t kidnap anyone. I didn\u2019t ask permission from his mom, however I still asked for permission from one of his legal guardians, there is no \u2018kidnapping\u2019", "Bro they'll get over it..  sometimes I think when adults become parents they forget all the emotions a child/teen goes through. I mean yeah spending family time is cool but the fact that no one showed would have stung like hell \n\nU did good brooo\nNTA", "I think you might be one of the kindest, most compassionate 16yo boys I've ever met.", "You are a real peach, my man. A prince among men. Bless your heart.", "I am good now, but it took a long time. My parents moved us away from that town when i was in grade 9 and then i finally made some good proper friends.\n   \n It's good you are there for your cousin, keep up the good work.", "Agreed. I\u2019m in the US. My kids are younger, but so far, all the parties we\u2019ve hosted for their friends have been max 2 hours. Same for all the parties my kids have been invited to. Family parties can be longer. Five hours is definitely an outlier!", "That doesn\u2019t matter. You check with the mother of the child, always. The parents are the only people who get to say yes or no in where their child goes. And yeah, his mom should have told him to ask his aunt, but also OP is old enough to learn that you ask the parents of the child.", ">never change for anyone.\n\nWhile i know you're intending this as a compliment, and we shouldn't change our kind nature FOR anyone,  the fact is that people change and develop over time and with experience. And OP is doing great now (the following is not supposed to be discouraging) and we can assume he's only human,  and it's entirely possible he will do something as an adult where he could be considered an AH, at which point he should change his perspective."]}
