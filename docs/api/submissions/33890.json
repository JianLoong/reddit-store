I told her if she really felt I was fibbing, she could hop on a scale, or try on some jeans from spring.\n\nShe insisted she'd put on no weight. I told her she was in denial, actively lying to herself and asked why, if it was true she's gained no weight, why is it she wears a lot of sweatpants now. Asked if that was weight related.\n\nShe called me a jerk. I told her she could've just not made the joke.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re both acting petty and childish. Grow up.

But being rude back is not constructive. Tell her how it made you feel. \n\nMy family roasts each other constantly for all kinds of things but we stay off whatever we know the other doesn\u2019t appreciate.

She wants to humiliate him while being in denial of her own weight gain. Unless they have a history of teasing each other this way this is rude on her part. Maybe saying shit back to her was counterproductive but i think a hard look is appropriate. Let her realize \"hmm maybe thst was a bit rude\"", "Have you opened up emotionally?
