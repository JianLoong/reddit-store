I couldn\u2019t take him due to going up with my aunt and her truck only holds two people due to her back seat piled with junk. My aunt also said she wanted a \u201cgirls day\u201d. \n\nI told him this and he wasn\u2019t happy, the day of the events he texted me telling me I was not allowed ti be in anything revealing (skirts at all, crop tops, shorts, short sleeves, ext..) I told him that one of my costumes included a skirt and he let it slide. \n\nLet me make it clear these events were outside and it was 107 degrees out. I got hot in my costume and changed, I had put on a black skirt that went to my knees and then one of my bf\u2019s shirts tucked into it. He was not happy to put it lightly, he yelled at me that I knew he wasn\u2019t comfortable with me being outside in revealing things when he wasn\u2019t there, he yelled I disrespected him. \n\nNothing I could do in the moment so I brushed it off, later I started posting pictures of the events and that\u2019s when he went off again, he told me I was disrespecting him and his boundaries by posting about an event he was excited for but couldn\u2019t go to, he said I had to take them down because he didn\u2019t want to see them because it wasn\u2019t right. \n\nI posted them anyway cause I had a lot of fun.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691737000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o1ezl/aita_for_going_against_my_boyfriends_boundaries/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That would have been his prerogative.\n\nHowever, he told you he doesn't want \\*you\\* to wear revealing clothes (and felt disrespected when you did): which is controlling manipulative behavior on his part, and one of the most fundamental red flags in a budding relationship, when one partner disrespects the the other partner\u2019s bodily autonomy.\n\nYou say this is a pattern.

Your boyfriend is being controlling and unreasonable. He has no right to tell you what you can or can't wear, especially when it's hot outside.

He is disrespecting you by trying to limit your freedom and happiness.", "NTA and please do not stay in a relationship with someone who monitors and tries to control you like this. You are a person, not his plaything.", "NTA, he sounds controlling and manipulative. The clothing you wore sounds more than appropriate, and sharing the photos should not be a problem. He needs to grow up, or you should find someone better than that", "NTA\n\nWearing clothes that are comfortable and appropriate for the weather (especially at 107) skirts/shorts, short sleeve shirts/tanks/crop tops are not a boundary. Did he expect you to be wrapped up in a bubble suit? Your boyfriend wanted to go, not because he wanted to, he wanted to go to be able to monitor you. He didn\u2019t end up going so he ended up monitoring you by telling you what you weren\u2019t allowed to wear. \n\nBoundaries are something we state to another person that tells that what we will or will not find acceptable. For example, in romantic relationships it\u2019s perfectly normal to tell you\u2019re partner what you\u2019re comfortable and uncomfortable with sexually. When it\u2019s about something your partner is wearing, that is no longer a boundary, it\u2019s controlling. I don\u2019t often wear a bra in my own home, sometimes I end up walking my dog or taking out the trash without a bra on, my boyfriend never yells at me or feels disrespected. He instead tells me it\u2019s my body and I choose what I put on it. \n\nI also want you to pay attention to how your boyfriend responded to when you didn\u2019t follow his \u201cboundary.\u201d He yelled at you, twice. I\u2019ve never been yelled at by my boyfriend, not even when fighting. Whereas my verbally abusive ex would yell at me for whatever he felt was unacceptable that day, like I once walked in to garage when he was working on his car. He didn\u2019t like that even though I was asking if he was ready for dinner. So pay attention, this doesn\u2019t sound healthy at all.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is not protective, this is controlling and abusive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWatch his behavior closely, and **reconsider the relationship. You should break up before this gets worse.** He is treating you like his property.", "NTA\n\nIf he feels disrespected then do him the courtesy of breaking up. You both deserve to be with someone who understands each other and your too young for this level of bullshit.", "NTA \n\nYou can do as you like. \n\nUnderstand that everyone has boundaries and some are completely silly.

This is why your bf will be upset even though I don\u2019t think YTA.", "It sounds like you had such a blast at those conventions, and I'm really glad you had fun! It's totally okay to be into different things than your boyfriend and still enjoy them. It can be a bit tricky when you both have different interests, but it's important to find ways to support each other. Your boyfriend might have some concerns about your safety, but it's also important for you to express yourself and have a good time. Maybe you could have a heart-to-heart talk with him about how both of you can feel comfortable and respected in the relationship.

You need to be having fun, going out with lots of friends and enjoying yourself, and not really getting serious with anyone at your age.  You're 18 and life is too short to be getting involved with someone who is trying to mold you into someone they believe you should be.  Discover who you are, what your own boundaries are, and when you want to get serious with someone you tell them who you are - not who you should be.  You tell them your worth - not tell you your worth.  Best of luck to you.", "NTA. \n\nHe shouldn't be mad you didn't take him with you if he didn't plan on coming in the first place and you went with your aunt.\nHe's the asshole for controlling how you should dress. Dress how you want, hot weather or not, ot shouldn't be any of his business. Saying it's disrespectful of you to dress how you wish is a huge red flag. Demanding you remove posts because you had fun without him, another huge red flag.", "NTA his boundaries: do not post his pictures. Your boundaries: you decide if you post your pictures. His boundaries: he doesn\u2019t wear low cut dresses. Your boundaries: you wear clothes you like. Any other questions?", "NTA  \nAnd why is it up to him to decide what you wear?  \nWear what you're comfortable in, and if he can't take it, then maybe it's not a relationship worth staying in.", "NTA\n\nIf he was actually protective he would not demand that you wear long pants and long sleeves in 107\u00b0 degree heat. That is a safety issue, plain and simple. You could get sick, experience sun/heat stroke, faint and get seriously hurt dressed that way in that type of heat. He isn\u2019t protective, he is controlling. He\u2019s also essentially telling you that if you dress in any other way than long sleeves/pants then it would be your fault if anything happened to you.\n\nThat isn\u2019t love, he isn\u2019t trying to keep you safe, he is trying to keep you in line. The fact that he thinks he has any say over what you wear is messed up. The fact that he yells at you the way he does is beyond messed up. He isn\u2019t just putting your physical health at risk, he is actively messing with your mental health.\n\nThat isn\u2019t love. It will only get worse and can have long lasting effects that can affect almost every aspect of your life in one way or another. I have been in similar relationships and I wish I had gotten out of them sooner. Trying to find your self again when you start feeling like a shell of yourself is painful. You deserve better, no one should ever treat you the way he does. Please get out that relationship, it\u2019s only going to get harder and harder. He will constantly be telling you what to do, what to wear, how to behave and no matter how perfectly you follow what he says, he will move the goal posts to make sure you constantly feel like you aren\u2019t good enough. To make you feel like you have to earn not just his love, but basic human decency from him.\n\nHe is abusive.", "NTA\n\nAnd you have a huge bf problem. He doesn't have boundaries, he is controlling and you shouldn't be fine with him controlling your body. \n\nA boundry is smthg about him like he doesn't want to do smthg or talk about smthg.

Why would the reason ever be to get that most abundant resource in the galaxy, i.e. male attention?", "because you wear something that is specifically designed to attract people's attention so why else? you can wear clothes that make you pretty and hot but aren't revealing, like you wear something that almost shows you arse and tits but act like you don't want attention?", "Boundaries are stuff like \"if you don't stop yelling at me, I will go. This will result in NC for a while\".\n\nForcing other people to do stuff is not a boundary. \"you are not allowed to wear that!\" is not a boundary.\n\nIt could be a boundary to say \"If you wear clothes that are too revealing, that is embarrasing to me.
