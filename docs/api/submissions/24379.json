I got hot in my costume and changed, I had put on a black skirt that went to my knees and then one of my bf\u2019s shirts tucked into it.

He didn\u2019t end up going so he ended up monitoring you by telling you what you weren\u2019t allowed to wear. \n\nBoundaries are something we state to another person that tells that what we will or will not find acceptable.

When it\u2019s about something your partner is wearing, that is no longer a boundary, it\u2019s controlling.

It will only get worse and can have long lasting effects that can affect almost every aspect of your life in one way or another. I have been in similar relationships and I wish I had gotten out of them sooner. Trying to find your self again when you start feeling like a shell of yourself is painful. You deserve better, no one should ever treat you the way he does. Please get out that relationship, it\u2019s only going to get harder and harder. He will constantly be telling you what to do, what to wear, how to behave and no matter how perfectly you follow what he says, he will move the goal posts to make sure you constantly feel like you aren\u2019t good enough.
