She intentionally told people you were pregnant before you wanted because she wanted attention.  She intentionally moved her wedding date to pull attention away from you and your baby.

And severely limiting contact with your mother is probably the best move for your mental health.\n\nYour family members have been conditioned to meet Mom's demands for decades.

And don't \"help\"with anything wedding related.  If you're invited, and you wish to attend, show up to the wedding as a guest.
