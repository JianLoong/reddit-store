He ate his entire bowl and probably 90% of the chips. I finished 1/2 to 2/3 of my bowl but wanted to keep the rest for leftovers the next day because I hadn't been to Chipotle in a while and its one of my favorite places.\n\nHe asked if he could have the rest of my bowl, and I said no because I just really wanted it for leftovers the next day. When we got home, I told him he could eat whatever I had in my pantry and fridge.\n\nFor context, the vast majority of the time I really do give him my leftovers whether we are out to eat or cooking at home, and every time he comes to visit I always get ingredients to make meals and extra snacks I know he enjoys because he eats a lot more than me.\n\nthe next day we saw my parents and somehow the Chipotle situation came up. When my dad and boyfriend weren't around, my mom came up to me and said I was being way too hard on my boyfriend for not giving him my leftovers and that I shouldn't let him go hungry. I told her I usually give them to him and I had food for him at home. She still said if he is hungry I should have given him the rest of my food and that in the future it is not that big of a deal that i have my leftovers.\n\nSo now I feel pretty bad- my boyfriend said it is fine but my mom clearly felt it wasn't. Was it rude of me for not giving the rest of my meal to him?\n\nEDIT: I am the one who brought it up the next day with my parents. I asked my bf for a bite of his food, and my dad made a lighthearted joke about me stealing my bf's food. I then joked back about my bf trying to steal my food the night before.\n\nIt was not a tense situation. My bf did not bring it up to them and was not upset. My mom then asked what happened the night before so that is how they found out.

If he needs more food, he can buy it or like you said, get it from the fridge or cook it. If you were keen to keep something for yourself specifically, that is totally valid. How come he gets to assert that he wants to eat something of yours and he\u2019s not weird, but if you want to eat it, that it\u2019s a petty thing to do?", "NTA\n\n> I shouldn't let him go hungry.\n\n#NO ONE IS GOING HUNGRY HERE", "NTA\n\nHe could've ordered an extra bowl when you told him your leftover intentions at dinner.\n\nYou don't need to give in out of guilt.", "NTA it's your BF's opinion that matters. Dunno why your mom thinks she can dictate what and when he eats.", "NTA. Your boyfriend shouldn't expect you to always give up your leftovers, and why does your mom seem to think that his needs come before yours. He is not a child and he could have gotten himself something, anything else to eat, in this case just not OP's leftovers.", "NTA\n\nGrown-ass man can order enough food for himself.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't let your boyfriend starve, your mom's being a little dramatic.  \nYou were craving that dish and your boyfriend finished his, so he can eat something else if he's hungry.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like she's pushing some old-fashioned \"woman must always provide food for man even at her own detriment\" thing. It's okay to save your leftovers for later, especially since he already ate his own meal, most of the shared snack, and had more to eat at home. Your mom is TA, especially because your bf doesn't even care that much. She doesn't need to be all up in your relationship business.\n\nAnd it's completely normal to share bites of food, my husband and I do it all the time. I always get a sip of his drink, and him from mine, we trade bites when we have something different, sometimes we offer each other leftovers, sometimes we don't.

And your mother needs to stay out of it. This is none of her business.", "I'm laughing since you said y'all aren't really tense over it.  Reminds me of my early relationship with my husband.  He genuinely thought that once we got home, leftovers were now an entirely different thing than \"food we ordered at restaurant\" and therefore should be up for grabs or AT LEAST split.  \n\n\nHe would actually say, \"I can't believe you won't let me have ***my half*** of the leftovers\"!!  It took me awhile to break him of this habit.  Usually, if I hadn't eaten them in 24 hours I'd just let him have them, but dammit, I wanted the option first!

Also sounds like the only one complaining is your mother, and it is none of her business.", "NTA. No, absolutely not. You do not need to sacrifice your own plans and food for your boyfriend. He can order more food, or eat what\u2019s available at home. You are not obligated to give him food you already have plans for. Honestly that\u2019s such a bonkers perspective- he\u2019s not a helpless child who can\u2019t feed himself.

He was not owed your leftover Chipotle food.  It was actually pretty rude of him to ask to eat the rest, also pretty rude of your mother to tell you how you \"shouldn't let him go hungry\". He's perfectly capable of making his own snacks, and you gave him free reign.", "NTA. Why did greedy guts need to tell your parents? I'm guessing his mama never said no to him.", ">and somehow the Chipotle situation came up\n\nBased on the post alone, I'd have said N A H, but when reading the comments we find out it \"came up\" because you asked him to share HIS food, and you conveniently glossed over this in the post.

Because that lesson doesn't stop at food: it flows through to choices of things like movies and restaurants, and giving up things that are important to you because your partner doesn't want to do them or wants to spend that money on something *he* wants.\n\nAsk me how I know this lesson damages your relationships with partners -- how it programs you to always put everyone else first, even when it's your turn to come first, even when what you *need* is more important than what your partner *wants*.\n\nIt's incredibly damaging. Because the other person gets used to always getting what they want, and they resent you or even get angry when you want something for yourself or you expect to have things go your way 50% of the time.\n\nIt sounds as though your mom grew up the same way my mom did -- and now you've internalized that lesson from her. It makes me wonder in what other ways you're sacrificing what you want or need in favor of what your boyfriend wants (and I'll bet there are others).\n\nIf you know that you're not going to want your leftovers, then fine, give them to your boyfriend. But **if you know that you're going to want to eat your leftovers, then say \"sorry, no, I'm really looking forward to having this later\".**\n\nPlease be kind to yourself and learn this lesson:\n\n**It's not selfish to do that. It's okay to prioritize yourself sometimes.**", "OP confirmed it was her who brought it up as a joke"]}
