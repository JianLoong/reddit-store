Her dad recently got in a bad car accident and he just got released from the hospital previously she had been staying with her dad and had moved the boyfriend and the boyfriend and the dad do not get along to the point where they came to blows they had made up or so she thought, but after the first day of her not being in the house, it was bad so she text me to come get him so that he can stay in my apartment with me because her boyfriend and her dad are not getting along. I go and get him and he is staying on my pull out sofa bed in my living room now mind you I live in a studio less than 500 ft.\u00b2 there is no wall in between my bedroom and my living room so when you walk in my front door, my bedroom is right there there\u2019s no hallway or anything it\u2019s living room over to the side kitchen my bedroom right past the living room. Everything is right there there\u2019s no wall so earlier today I was at work and she calls me telling me that she\u2019s going on a road trip with her boyfriend and her boyfriend\u2019s best friend to the best friends house lives about  he lives about two hours away. OK cool so I mention hey are y\u2019all going to be back before midnight? Because you know I have to go to work in the morning and I\u2019m not comfortable with just locking one lock on my door and I don\u2019t wanna have to wake up to unlock the door, she freaks out and goes, why did you give him a key if he can\u2019t come and go as he pleases? I proceed to say it\u2019s not that he can come and go as he pleases it\u2019s a respect thing I don\u2019t want people going coming in my house after I\u2019m in bed asleep I go to bed around midnight, so she post on Facebook say calling me out that I don\u2019t want to help her out in the situation but that\u2019s OK. She\u2019s gonna find a solution. So my question is this am I the asshole for telling her?

She is the one that is upset. I think he understands I don\u2019t mind him staying here as long as you know, he comes in at a reasonable hour. I did give him a key he\u2019s not in prison if he wants to leave I want him to be able to lock my house up when I\u2019m not here, when he came, I even went out of my way because he didn\u2019t come with the toothbrush deodorant, anything like that I went out of my way to get him these things so that he would have them I have a vehicle he doesn\u2019t he is on disability so he has a very limited income so I went ahead out of my pocket and went and got him these things. I even made sure to give him some headphones so that if he wanted to watch TV on his phone or some thing he could I don\u2019t have a TV or anything in my living room I have a projector in my bedroom that I told him he was more than welcome to use, if he wanted to watch something on it", "NTA- your house, your rules.

You don't have to let this random guy stay with you", "This is pretty unreadable and hard to follow \n\nINFO : Who is staying with you? \n\nYou are doing your friend a favour. Your  friends dad or boyfriend is staying with you at your studio flat as he can\u2019t stay at her flat. Because her dad and boyfriend argue. Her dad is recovering from an operation so it\u2019s temporary as he can\u2019t go to his own home. He (boyfriend or friends Dad?) sleeps on your pull out sofa. Your bed is near this sofa bed as it is a small studio flat. Everything except bathroom is open plan. \n\nThey are going out on a trip and will return long after midnight. You don\u2019t want to give him a key. You don\u2019t want anyone letting themselves in to your studio flat in the middle of the night. It will wake you up after you\u2019ve gone to bed -  you have work in the morning. Your friend is slating you on social media because of it . Am I the asshole? \n\nNo , NTA \n\nYou did friend\u2019s - boyfriend or dad- a favour , as a favour to your friend herself.  By slating you she\u2019s worn out his welcome. Time he goes home now. Or goes to stay with someone else. \n\nAnyone that agrees with her in comments on those social media posts , I\u2019d reply \u201chey I\u2019ve been doing this favour for ages now. Sounds like it\u2019s your turn and that you\u2019d be up for it\u201d \n\n\u201cHey great you think that, I\u2019ll tell boyfriend/dad (whoever is staying with you) you\u2019d welcome him staying at yours. I\u2019ve done my bit but can\u2019t anymore \u201d", "This was so hard to read with all the missing punctuation, but from what I\u2019ve gathered you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s like she feels entitled to your apartment because you were willing to help.

Her getting mad then blasting you on social media just shows what kind of friend she is. Dump her lol", "NTA. Put him out, and tell her she can deal with two grown ass men acting like kids. Get the key back. JFC, the entitlement of some people!", "Sorry, I couldn't read that. Try using punctuation and capitalization.", "This is almost impossible to read, but from what I understand, she has an apartment with the boyfriend, she\u2019s got her dad staying with her temporarily(at her apartment) while her dad recovers, so she\u2019s asked if her boyfriend can stay at yours.   Is that correct?   If so is there a reason she cannot go stay at her dad\u2019s with him while he recovers and her boyfriend stays at their place?", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to provide housing for her boyfriend. Set an end date for him to be out.", "It doesn't sound much of a friend if they prefer to vent things publicly on Facebook rather than talking things out...\n\nClearly NTA here."]}
