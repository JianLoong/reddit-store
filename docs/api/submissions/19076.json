She and I aren\u2019t close at all. We\u2019ve maybe said 3 sentences to each other in the past ten years, but most extended family was invited.\n\nI brought my boyfriend (20m) as my plus one. He\u2019d only met my parents before since this side of the family only really sees each other for weddings or funerals. \n\nSo the wedding ceremony happens and then there\u2019s a cocktail hour while we wait for the catering to arrive. When the food shows up we go to get some food and it is only pulled pork sandwiches. There are no sides or any other options. i\u2019m not a pulled pork fan, but I would\u2019ve just eaten a sandwich except my boyfriend is Muslim and can\u2019t eat pork, so we decide to wait and stay a little longer into the reception and then we\u2019ll leave and get some dinner at a restaurant.\n\nSo we sit through the speeches and all the first dances and the cutting of the cake and then when it\u2019s just dancing and no more events we say goodbye to my parents and relatives we were sitting with and go grab some dinner at one of the few restaurants that is open later on Sundays.\n\n\nI think all is good, but then I wake up to a text from my cousin\u2019s parents (my first cousin and her husband) saying that it was ridiculously childish of me to \u201cstorm out\u201d of the wedding just because I didn\u2019t like the food. (I assume that they asked my parents where I went and they said we went to get dinner.)\n\nI try to explain to them that it was because my boyfriend can\u2019t eat pork due to religious reasons and to that they responded that i shouldn\u2019t have brought someone so difficult that I knew was going to cause a scene. First of all there was no scene. second of all I hadn\u2019t assumed it would just be pulled pork or we would\u2019ve eaten pre wedding. \n\nI responded to them saying they\u2019re being kind of ridiculous since I left after all the events during the reception and there was no scene. They responded saying that I\u2019m not welcome at any family events with my boyfriend since he obviously has no respect for them or their culture???\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t think my 2nd cousin or her new husband are upset at all. My parents also don\u2019t see the big deal about it and I really think my cousin and her husband are just using it as an excuse for their islamophobia, but was it wrong for us to leave the reception earlier than most people?", "created_utc": 1685997992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141r9zo/aita_for_leaving_my_cousins_wedding_early/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hesitate to call anyone an A H based on this lack of info. However, it seems odd to me that the food choices weren't communicated ahead of time and that no vegetarian options were available. It also seems odd to me that the first thing the family did was assume it is your bf being difficult.\n\nWithout extra details, it seems like you are most likely NTA but there are some gaps in the info.

They don\u2019t strike me as people to forget perceived slights.", "NTA because you didn't throw a fit causing a scene & left quietly when it's perfectly acceptable to. Either they're showing their bigotry, embarrassment over not supplying ample food, or both. Ignore them & don't allow them to get in your head nor blame your bf for *their* choices. \n\nAlso, they have some audacity to ban your bf from family events as if they have the only say in the matter. Plus, who only serves 1 type of sandwich at a wedding with zero sides? It's not only religious people who don't eat pork or pulled pork, too. I can't stand BBQ due to digestive & textural issues & would have had to leave to eat, too. They were cheap & people leaving early to find food because they didn't inform their guests prior was the consequence.", "NTA. I love me some pulled pork, but sandwiches as the only offering at a wedding dinner...with no sides? I woulda noped right on out of there, probably earlier than you did.", "NTA 1 - just 1 sandwich during cocktails is weird. 2- after cake it's considered fine to bow out. No \"scene\" was made so your assumption of Islamophobia is probably spot on. And we don't cater to racists.", "NTA, But WTF, just a bun with slop on it?  No sides? They expect people to stay for hours and dance after not really being fed?  If they complain again tell them, it was ranked right there with school lunchroom fare and was tacky serving just a sloppy joe with no sides.  Tell them you outgrew this type of food in Jr. High and needed an adult meal.", "Who are they to tell you that you that you\u2019re not welcome to family events with your boyfriend? Do they host every family event? OP you\u2019re NTA! Bring your boyfriend to whatever event you\u2019d like. THEY would be the ones causing a scene and I\u2019m sure plenty of other family members would notice.", "NTA, you handled the entire thing with class. You stayed for an appropriate amount of time, didn't make any scene at all,  and left quietly. Who only serves one kind of food at a wedding? I'm guessing if there were any vegetarians/vegans in attendance, they were probably equally unhappy. It could be that you were just the first to leave in a long line of other people who wanted different food and you're just the easiest target for your cousin/aunt and uncle? Plus, if they're Islamophobic, then you're an even easier target. Either way, you did nothing wrong. Be glad you don't have to see them again. I would be after that.", "NTA. The real asshole is the person who skewed reality and made it bigger deal than what happened when OP left the event.", "NTA...you stayed an appropriate amount of time.  And if you're only serving one thing Pork seems like an odd choice.  Many ppl don't eat pork for non-religious reasons too.", "NTA. Not only were you incredibly polite about the whole thing but the one option thing is ridiculous. I\u2019m vegetarian and couldn\u2019t eat the pulled pork sandwiches and I know others who are gluten intolerant and so on. That was honestly a little rude of the hosting couple to only have one option with no sides.", "NAH. I mean you weren't there, are we positive your parents didn't make a scene? It's weird that the reason why even got back to them.", "NTA, but there is no good reason (short of severe food allergies) to not eat a pulled pork sandwich.  Dee-lish.", "Definitely NTA. You waited for all the special and important aspects of the reception to have been held and then left quietly to eat. You didn't make a fuss there about the lack of choice. They are definitely smelling of either racism or islamaphobia.", "NTA but your relatives definitely are. Sounds like they were embarrassed about their cheap wedding dinner and then took out their embarrassment on you. At least you no longer have to deal with them?", "NTA.  Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.  Huge pass.  I\u2019d pass her text around and say I gather I\u2019m not welcome, best wishes to all of you.\u201d", "NTA. You can see this is them being islamophobic/racist, right?", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. It's always been my understanding that etiquette asks guests to stay until the cake is cut. After that, you can leave at anytime. You did that. Anyone mad at your leaving is the one with the problem.", "NTA. I Agree with your point about the phobia. Makes sense they\u2019re deflecting.", "NTA at all. You were classy about your departure. Boyfriend is \"difficult\" = code for \"unwelcome heathen,\" and that's why they assume he doesn't respect their \"culture...\" of pork and bigotry.", "NTA - geez, you guys stayed that long?

I ask because it makes their confrontation even more egregious.", "Info: What culture only eats pulled pork sandwiches? \n\nLeaving after all the ceremonial duties are complete isn\u2019t rude or disrespectful to any culture, other than the made up \u201cpulled pork devotees\u201d your cousin professes to be part of.", "NTA.

It's part of being a good host.

I see where you\u2019re coming from but I think it\u2019s a little out of the ordinary to call up a bride and say what you\u2019re not able to eat."]}
