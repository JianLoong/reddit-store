She and I aren\u2019t close at all. We\u2019ve maybe said 3 sentences to each other in the past ten years, but most extended family was invited.\n\nI brought my boyfriend (20m) as my plus one. He\u2019d only met my parents before since this side of the family only really sees each other for weddings or funerals. \n\nSo the wedding ceremony happens and then there\u2019s a cocktail hour while we wait for the catering to arrive. When the food shows up we go to get some food and it is only pulled pork sandwiches. There are no sides or any other options. i\u2019m not a pulled pork fan, but I would\u2019ve just eaten a sandwich except my boyfriend is Muslim and can\u2019t eat pork, so we decide to wait and stay a little longer into the reception and then we\u2019ll leave and get some dinner at a restaurant.\n\nSo we sit through the speeches and all the first dances and the cutting of the cake and then when it\u2019s just dancing and no more events we say goodbye to my parents and relatives we were sitting with and go grab some dinner at one of the few restaurants that is open later on Sundays.\n\n\nI think all is good, but then I wake up to a text from my cousin\u2019s parents (my first cousin and her husband) saying that it was ridiculously childish of me to \u201cstorm out\u201d of the wedding just because I didn\u2019t like the food. (I assume that they asked my parents where I went and they said we went to get dinner.)\n\nI try to explain to them that it was because my boyfriend can\u2019t eat pork due to religious reasons and to that they responded that i shouldn\u2019t have brought someone so difficult that I knew was going to cause a scene. First of all there was no scene. second of all I hadn\u2019t assumed it would just be pulled pork or we would\u2019ve eaten pre wedding. \n\nI responded to them saying they\u2019re being kind of ridiculous since I left after all the events during the reception and there was no scene. They responded saying that I\u2019m not welcome at any family events with my boyfriend since he obviously has no respect for them or their culture???\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t think my 2nd cousin or her new husband are upset at all. My parents also don\u2019t see the big deal about it and I really think my cousin and her husband are just using it as an excuse for their islamophobia, but was it wrong for us to leave the reception earlier than most people?", "created_utc": 1685997992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141r9zo/aita_for_leaving_my_cousins_wedding_early/", "score": 1394, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They expect people to stay for hours and dance after not really being fed?

It could be that you were just the first to leave in a long line of other people who wanted different food and you're just the easiest target for your cousin/aunt and uncle?
