It\u2019s very understandable that your sons birthday is a trauma anniversary for you, and the birth trauma isn\u2019t a settled issue. However, I do think your family has also had a hard time, sounds like there was a period where they thought they might lose their daughter. Sounds like they want a part of their healing from that to be a large family celebration, and they haven\u2019t had the opportunity to celebrate your son in a large group. \n\nYou are prioritizing your emotional needs on your son\u2019s birthday over your family\u2019s emotional needs, and it is completely appropriate to do so and sounds like the best decision for your mental health. My advice to you would be to work with your mom to plan an alternative event in lieu of something on your sons birthday. It seems like it\u2019s important to your family and would bring them a lot of meaning and closure from what was also a difficult time for them.", "NTA this time, but you could be soon. I've almost labeled the situation as YTA but I'm very concerned that your mental health is causing this. The amount of energy you're extending keeping family away could be exhausting for you. Yes, the experience was exhausting and scary and you and your baby lived through it. You both are alive. This birth celebration could have been the begging of a ritual to remember you and your baby's death. Where's the gratitude?\n\nAt some point you're going to have to make yourself uncomfortable in order to move past this. You're a parent now and need to step up hard for a vulnerable child. You also must let the baby's father relate unfettered by your trauma. He has a right to his family's involvement. \n\nYour trauma is keeping the expanded family distanced. It matters not that a baby doesn't remember their first celebration of life. What matters is that their birth has changed the family as a whole in a positive way and your child has a right to experience that. \n\nWomen go through this trauma often. We're so lucky that there is now post-birth trauma and depression counseling. It's based on research now, so it takes effect quickly. But you have had a year and no progress?\n\nI don't know what country you're from but here in the States we have gotten so attuned to personal freedom and individual needs that we don't consider the whole. This is what I  think is your weakest point to justify. It's been a year since the birth and, from the way you've presented this, there is no joy. This past year was an opportunity to move past the horror and to feel the life force of your baby. So now you seem angry that the family wants to bond and smell baby heads Android poopy diapers. They are not the enemy. \n\nGet counseling now. You*must* move past this with the aid of trained persons as well as your family. If you're resenting family for wanting to see your child you are wrong. Push yourself. Every day move out of this fear-based behavior. Do your counseling homework.

My kids are usually mostly confused because almost all the people they know are all together in our house.

Hung up a banner on the fireplace mantle, invited the family across the street and their kids to stop by for coffee and snacks (they did know what we were up to, it wasn't an ambush), then everyone put on happy birthday hats and we took a bunch of pictures...  My daughter didn't even know until a few years ago (and she's 22) that it wasn't a real party (obviously, she's seen the photos)", "I respect your experience, but wanted to add that, while I don't know about major trauma, for \"small t\" trauma I have found CBT helpful. I think it depends on the individual to some extent and also the skill of the practitioner. I participated in a CBT study through the local university's psychology department that was very structured. I was asked to generate lists of the bothersome thoughts about the disturbing experience (aka trauma), then worked with a therapist to recognize distortions in those thoughts and to generate more realistic alternatives. I would then refer to those more realistic thoughts whenever I experienced episodes of anxiety between sessions and rate how effective they were. Then I would go over this the following week with the therapist and fine tune as necessary. It did not require me to \"relive\" the experience and in fact helped me differentiate between helpful and unhelpful \"reprocessing\" of the event. \n\nOther practitioners seem to have a much more vague idea of what CBT actually is and treat it like a variation on mindfulness, which is not helpful for me. \n\nThat said, CBT is still not for everyone, we're all wired differently. But I do think it can be helpful when done right.", "I'm imagining grandma smearing cake all over this cardboard cutout of a baby now. lol", "How does that deal with the underlying problems, though? Sure, I can restructure how I react to negative or unproductive thoughts related to my trauma. That doesn't change the visceral panic I feel when someone raises their voice near me, or when I have a question for a teacher. Changing the thoughts I have to more realistic ones is definitely gonna help my self esteem, and maybe it can push down the thoughts about my trauma for a little while. But they're going to come back, because trauma restructures your brain in a way that just saying no to the bad thoughts can't fix.", "I think this goes back to how the person is wired. I think CBT practitioners would argue that a thought always precedes the feeling (i.e. panic) even if we don't always recognize it. Often, the thought is so fleeting or we're not in the habit of listening to our thoughts analytically so that we are not aware of it as it's going through our head until we experience the consequence of the thought -- which is the panic, or anxiety, or anger, etc.\n\nExample I am lying in bed and an image of the event rushes through my mind, and I become panicked. CBT would say there was a thought -- \"I'll never stop reliving this\" or \"I can't tolerate this memory\" or \"I'm damaged forever\" -- that followed the image and precipitated the panic, though it may have rushed through my head very quickly and so i may have interpreted the image or memory as directly causing the panic. The idea is to slow down one's thinking enough to recognize that the thought exists and is fueling the panic.\n\nI know there is not universal agreement on this principle (\"thought precedes feeling\"). In fact I was suspicious at first and at times said \"there is no thought that I'm having, the feeling came first,\" or \"the feeling is just there\" but my therapist insisted that there must be a thought, and in most cases I came to agree.\n\nAgain I know it is not effective for everyone or every experience, and even if you \"buy in\" that thought precedes feelings, it doesn't necessarily work for everyone to work through it by attacking the thought. For me, I can say it was imperfect but the most effective form of therapy I've had.", "NTA\n\nNot like babies remember their first birthday anyways.\n\nYou guys go and bond as a family on vacation.

Some people get over the fear by celebrating (which might be what your family is doing) but that doesn't mean you have too. The first birthday is....tough. really tough. And that's ok. \n\nGently, I would recommend, if you feel like you can, maybe taking some time to tell your family, or your mom, about how traumatizing your child's birth was. You don't have to go into details. But let her know that with the one year anniversary, and first birthday, yes it's a big deal for celebrating your child, but it also brought a lot of that trauma back, and that you are trying your best to do what's best for all of you while you go through it.

It would be one thing if your kid was 8 or 10, but anything before the 5th birthday is not something they will be able to appreciate or remember. 1st birthday parties are an excuse to celebrate, and it hardly counts as a celebration if the two people who should be most happy are miserable.\n\nAlso, regarding your edit 2, I just want to pose some food for thought for one of the middle points that you mentioned. Regarding the test results, will they have any impact on how much you love or even think about your son? At the end of the day, even if the worst possible thing happens, will you love him any less? Even if you find out that all future children will have the same problems, will that make you regret having your son? Because I am guessing that you are stressing out over possibilities rather than enjoying your beautiful baby boy.\n\nWhatever issues may come, it will be something that you all can work through together, and (making an assumption since he is traveling with you) the fact that he is not hospitalized means its entirely something you all can manage, no matter what the test results are.

I'm panicking because for that brief moment I'm 10 again, being screamed at. I'm 6, being raped by someone I loved and trusted and looked up to. I'm 7, finding out my father abandoned me. No amount of cognitive restructuring is going to change that kind of pain. It will always be there.
