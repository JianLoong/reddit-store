My son was born very early and spent the first couple of months in NICU.

His birth happened very quickly, I went in for a check up and ended up being kept in and taken for an emergency c-section.\n\nThe closer it has gotten to son's first birthday, the more it is bringing up the trauma of what happened. My side of the family are wanting to do a big get-together, to celebrate his birthday because we never got to do a baby shower or celebrate his birth together. When he did come home, we wouldn't allow them to all come at once - we actually told them we came home a week later than we did. We have repeatedly said that we aren't planning on doing anything for his birthday.\n\nWhen son came home, my partner booked us a few days away before his first birthday as we thought he would be off his home oxygen by then. As my family don't seem to understand that we don't want to do anything for son's first birthday, we made the decision to extend our holiday so that we now come home after his birthday. My family are now furious that we are away for son's first birthday and are claiming we are ruining son's birthday for them. My mom has even told me I am being selfish by not allowing her to spend son's first birthday with him. She's even said that she didn't raise me to be this horrible to my grandparents (not her parents, they are my dad's parents) as they may not be around to celebrate a second birthday with son.\n\nAITA for purposefully extending my holiday so we are not around to celebrate son's first birthday?\n\nEdit: Son WILL be with us on the holiday. Son, partner and I will be together on his birthday.\n\nEdit 2: We are getting therapy for the birth trauma, we are just finding it difficult to find closure in everything until we get some test results back. Depending on what the results of these tests are, they can have an affect on any future children we decide to have, they will also tell us if son has inherited a genetic condition from us as he has several medical issues. However this tests can take a year to come back and the weren't sent off until August.
