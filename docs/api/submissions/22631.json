She has the right to ask you if she can wear it and you have the right to say no. I get that it might be annoying for her, but no need to rant about it.", "NTA what event could she possibly have that a teenagers prom dress would be appropriate for a grandma to wear it to?", "NTA because why would you gran be wanting to wear the same dress as a teen? IDK maybe she wants to feel like \"she's still got it\" or something but no. It's an odd request to begin with tbh.", "NTA - it was her choice to buy you the dress, and even though she paid for it, it doesn't mean it's hers. Enjoy prom x", "NTA what's a 54 year old doing in a high schooler's prom dress", "NTA.", "sounds like a bit trashy tbh", "Info: does she want to wear it to something, or just put it on and see how it looks?", "NTA. Aside from her thinking she gets to share the dress because she paid for it (that is not how gifts work, ever), this is a weird request. Like borrowing a graduation gown or a wedding dress for a night out. Is she jealous of you or competing with you? Did she never get a prom of her own and wants to pretend?", "1. It is weird that she wants to wear a prom dress out, but it\u2019s also fine for her to ask\n2. You probably won\u2019t wear it again, so there\u2019s probably no harm in letting her have it for a night, but it was a gift so you\u2019re well within you\u2019re right to decline the request\n3. Someone declaring that because they paid for a gift means they get to use it is childish and not how gifts work so your nan is the A H\n\nYou are NTA", "Question: what are you planning on doing with your prom dress now that it's over? I'm not going to say you were an asshole, but what's the harm in letting your grandmother wear it? My grandmother's are dead, and I wish I could see either of them in my prom dress.", "NTA. If Nan can afford to pay for half of your prom dress, she can probably afford to pay for a brand new party dress for herself. Also it's weird that she wants to wear a prom dress to a party with (I assume) other adults.", "NTA but what are you gonna do to the dress?", "NTA. Also why does she want to wear a teenager's prom dress to a party? What kind of party is it?!\n\n\nMaybe you could go shopping with her to help her pick out a new (and maybe more age appropriate) dress?", "nta???? this is so odd of her to ask. like, obviously she has no ownership of it bc it was a gift to you but i'm shocked at the audacity of the question lmfaoo. why would anyone want to wear their grandchild's prom dress out to a party??", "Looking at your ages, it's pretty clear your family peaks early, so I get why you probably value a prom dress like it's precious.  Grandma wanting to wear it is weird. NTA", "NTA. It was a gift but apparently she had ulterior motives", "NTA What a weird thing for someone of her age to ask.", "NtA! I bought my child the food in the fridge does that give me right to half of every meal they have?\nRidiculous mentality", "NTA they bought you the dress as a gift. She has no claim to it and quite frankly it\u2019s ridiculous your Nan would want to wear her Granddaughters prom dress..", "Nta also even if she could fit into its a young girls dress not a 50 somethings dress.", "Yta why not let her wear it . It was after you are done right ?.", "54 and 16? What dress would look good on both? Just wondering what the dress looks like.", "YTA - your grandma wants to feel young and pretty for 10 mins, she just bought you the dress for prom. Let her wear it and do a twirl in the mirror ffs. Are you such an atomised individual that you can't spare one minor inconvenience for you damn grandma?", "YTA ungrateful and immature. 99% of prom dresses just gather dust in people\u2019s closets. She PAID* for half so it\u2019s not a big ask to wear it AFTER your prom.", "NTA in thinking a gift is just that, a gift and you can do what you like with your dress.  If nan was planning to borrow it she could have made that a condition of paying for it.\n\nBut I\u2019m curious, so you have something planned for this dress that somehow precludes her borrowing it?  Could she not wear it for whatever evening and return it to you cleaned?  Does your nan have a habit of borrowing prom dresses and destroying them?\n\nMaybe she thought it would be fun to take a picture in the dress and send it to your grandfather.  Maybe she\u2019s going to a senior center prom.  Maybe it would be a nice ego boost for her to see if she\u2019s the same weight as her beautiful granddaughter.  Maybe she wants to dress up, get sloppy drunk and force the cat to slow dance with her.  Who cares, what\u2019s the harm in letting her borrow it?  \n\nI don\u2019t know your nan and I don\u2019t know your family but I\u2019ll just caution you that these are the stories that become the stuff of family legends and not in a good way.  In 20 years you\u2019ll be planning your wedding and nan will not attend but she will send you a gift certificate to proms-are-us because \u201cthe only thing that girl ever cared about was prom dresses.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019re planning to attend the same party let her borrow it.  Yeah, it\u2019s probably not age appropriate but that\u2019s not your concern.", "Granny was a teen mom, maybe she missed her own prom due to pregnancy?", "YTA. It\u2019s a piece of cloth. You are finished with it. You have the memories and the pictures. For Pete\u2019s sake, share that insignificant item with a person that loves you. Watch them sparkle. (And stop behaving like a spoiled brat.)", "Most people don't reward their prom dresses. Why not give it to her?", "I didn\u2019t let one of my mom\u2019s friends wear mine either. Mostly because I hadn\u2019t even had my prom yet and they were going to the coast guard ball that night then moving across the country the next day. I didn\u2019t want it to get lost and like I said I haven\u2019t even worn it yet.", "NTA and people are freakin weird entitled assholes these days wtf thats like asking if you can wear someones wedding dress cause you paid for part of it wtf lol", "Honestly I'm going to get downvoted to hell by I think YTA.  It's a formal dress.  It's such a waste of money not to let other people wear it.  It's not your wedding dress. It's prom.  Pretty much every woman in my family has worn one of my formal dresses because it was classy and didn't look like a stereotypical teenage prom dress.  It cost a shit ton and my mom paid for it, who was I to say someone couldn't wear it.  Of course technically it's yours and you don't HAVE to let someone else wear it, but it's petty it silly not to.  What a waste of money for one night.", "NTA they bought you the dress as a gift.", "Yta why not let her wear it", "Most people don't reward their prom dresses.", "[deleted]", "I mean maybe she\u2019d feel differently if some time had passed since prom but it\u2019s been 2 days. I just wore a dress my mum had, but I know all my friends bought new dresses and really treasured them. Now it\u2019s been over 7yrs and they do just say \u201cwhat am I supposed to do with this? I could get it cut to cocktail length, but the top is really not my style anymore hmm\u201d. But that\u2019s years and not 2 days later when you\u2019re an 16yr old on a prom high. \n\nShe\u2019s 16 probably thinking it was the best night of her life and wasn\u2019t she so beautiful. Her dress is so treasured and wondrous. She probably doesn\u2019t want to see anyone else in it. She probably wants to treasure it as \u201cher prom dress\u201d for longer than 2 days before it becomes surrendered to \u201cthe family fancy dress\u201d to be shared and passed around.", "I was thinking this same thing. My prom dress sat in my closet for years until it was donated to a thrift store. \n\nYou could make it a fun special time with you helping her get ready.", "She wants to wear it for a night out, not just to try it on.", "Name one culture this is seen as a normal common joke... I'll wait."]}
