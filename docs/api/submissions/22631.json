It is weird that she wants to wear a prom dress out, but it\u2019s also fine for her to ask\n2.

Could she not wear it for whatever evening and return it to you cleaned?  Does your nan have a habit of borrowing prom dresses and destroying them?\n\nMaybe she thought it would be fun to take a picture in the dress and send it to your grandfather.  Maybe she\u2019s going to a senior center prom.  Maybe it would be a nice ego boost for her to see if she\u2019s the same weight as her beautiful granddaughter.

It's a formal dress.  It's such a waste of money not to let other people wear it.  It's not your wedding dress. It's prom.  Pretty much every woman in my family has worn one of my formal dresses because it was classy and didn't look like a stereotypical teenage prom dress.  It cost a shit ton and my mom paid for it, who was I to say someone couldn't wear it.

It could be a classic, timeless style that the nan appreciates. Either way, it's not weird for her to ask, but you also have the right to say no. However, if my mom could have fit into one of my prom dresses (my nans were long gone by then) and she wanted to borrow it, I would have said yes.

Maybe after your prom she can borrow it. \n\nBut this is *your* day and your dress, but somehow she's making it about her. Does she do this kind of thing a lot?", "NTA, if she wanted that dress so bad, she ought to have bought one for herself.", "NTA\n\nBy her logic she would also have to discuss wearing your dress with your mom, as she also paid for half. Besides, if she likes it so much, then she can go and buy her own. I get that dresses can cost a lot of money, but what's to stop her from asking about wearing it for other functions in the future?

It\u2019s not like she asked before prom and I doubt you\u2019ll wear it again. Only reason it\u2019s NTA instead of NAH is because she should of just stopped at your no.

If you\u2019re insistent on not letting her wear the dress because it\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d dress this will almost 100% effect your relationship with that family member. Next time you need assistance, or Nan has a opportunity for you, she will remember this. Sometimes your life can change because of something small someone does for you.

Maybe she sees it as she paid for half so she gets \"partial custody\" where you obviously view it as a gift.

There was just a fundamental disconnect from the beginning.", "Let her wear the dumb dress", "Prom is just an excuse to drink and listen to bad music, nothing more.

In which case, a prom dress, whether it\u2019s a tulle or train or a simple cocktail dress would make her a bit overdressed and stick out like a sore thumb, for lack of a better phrase.\n\nOr is it an evening dinner party, and the dress fits the code (in which case I\u2019d say the nan is less of an AH for asking, but I still wouldn\u2019t blame OP for not wanting to let her nan wear it because of the potential style clash, the potential measurement clash between OP and her nan which, depending on the fabric quality and the difference between their measurements, could result in the stretch of the fabric or even ripping of the seams, and also the possibility of spillages onto the dress\u2013 accidents happen, but even if the nan will be careful that doesn\u2019t mean other people will be)", "That\u2019s a fair point, as another commenter has pointed out to me, however I would like to say that this is also a question that lies in the nature of the event that OP\u2019s nan is attending and the appropriateness of wearing an evening gown.\n\nIt could be a simple lunchtime get-together with friends, in which the nan would be overdressed for the occasion (even if the dress were an evening gown or a cocktail-type dress).\n\nHowever, in the (admittedly more likely) event it\u2019s a sort of dinner party she\u2019s attending, that does put nan as less of an AH (for asking, blowing up at OP was still a crappy thing to do imo\u2013 she paid for half of the dress _for_ OP\u2013 and tbh, the way she was acting on the night of the prom casts some doubt as to whether or not her payment was solely out of good will or whether it was so she could later lay claim to the dress because of her paying for half of it) there is still the worry, at least in my mind, of the dress being stained\u2013 whether by drinks or by food, accidents do happen and while the nan may be careful of how she eats and drinks, there\u2019s no say in whether everyone else will be as careful, and not all stains are easy to remove (especially when it comes to food)", "I\u2019m actually so weirded out by grandma\u2019s fixation on her granddaughter\u2019s prom dress.

It's like all the people who just go \"X needs therapy, they should get it now\" like therapists are crawling around begging for their appointments to be taken for pennies.  Therapists have been booked the hell up for years and they charge a pretty penny, but people on this sub assume by saying \"X needs therapy\" they've meaningfully contributed, made more ridiculous when sometimes the background story strongly indicates there is no money to be had.\n\nSo yea, dress to rent is ridiculous.
