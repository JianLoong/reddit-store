It is weird that she wants to wear a prom dress out, but it\u2019s also fine for her to ask\n2.

Could she not wear it for whatever evening and return it to you cleaned?  Does your nan have a habit of borrowing prom dresses and destroying them?\n\nMaybe she thought it would be fun to take a picture in the dress and send it to your grandfather.  Maybe she\u2019s going to a senior center prom.  Maybe it would be a nice ego boost for her to see if she\u2019s the same weight as her beautiful granddaughter.

It's a formal dress.  It's such a waste of money not to let other people wear it.  It's not your wedding dress. It's prom.  Pretty much every woman in my family has worn one of my formal dresses because it was classy and didn't look like a stereotypical teenage prom dress.  It cost a shit ton and my mom paid for it, who was I to say someone couldn't wear it.

It could be a classic, timeless style that the nan appreciates. Either way, it's not weird for her to ask, but you also have the right to say no.

Does she do this kind of thing a lot?", "NTA, if she wanted that dress so bad, she ought to have bought one for herself.", "NTA\n\nBy her logic she would also have to discuss wearing your dress with your mom, as she also paid for half. Besides, if she likes it so much, then she can go and buy her own. I get that dresses can cost a lot of money, but what's to stop her from asking about wearing it for other functions in the future?

It\u2019s not like she asked before prom and I doubt you\u2019ll wear it again. Only reason it\u2019s NTA instead of NAH is because she should of just stopped at your no.

If you\u2019re insistent on not letting her wear the dress because it\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d dress this will almost 100% effect your relationship with that family member. Next time you need assistance, or Nan has a opportunity for you, she will remember this. Sometimes your life can change because of something small someone does for you.

Maybe she sees it as she paid for half so she gets \"partial custody\" where you obviously view it as a gift.

There was just a fundamental disconnect from the beginning.", "Let her wear the dumb dress", "Prom is just an excuse to drink and listen to bad music, nothing more.

If the child was the rightful owner of the item, the parent couldn't sell it. Parents also often sell toys their children don't play with anymore (often with the child's consent), but that money goes to the parent, not the child.
