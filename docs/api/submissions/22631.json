She has the right to ask you if she can wear it and you have the right to say no. I get that it might be annoying for her, but no need to rant about it.", "NTA what event could she possibly have that a teenagers prom dress would be appropriate for a grandma to wear it to?", "NTA because why would you gran be wanting to wear the same dress as a teen? IDK maybe she wants to feel like \"she's still got it\" or something but no. It's an odd request to begin with tbh.", "NTA - it was her choice to buy you the dress, and even though she paid for it, it doesn't mean it's hers. Enjoy prom x", "NTA what's a 54 year old doing in a high schooler's prom dress", "NTA.", "sounds like a bit trashy tbh", "Info: does she want to wear it to something, or just put it on and see how it looks?", "NTA. Aside from her thinking she gets to share the dress because she paid for it (that is not how gifts work, ever), this is a weird request. Like borrowing a graduation gown or a wedding dress for a night out. Is she jealous of you or competing with you? Did she never get a prom of her own and wants to pretend?"]}
