You are entitled to feel however you want but it doesn't mean you can yell at your friends. It sounds like they were coming from a place of caring and trying to help with your relationship with your parent's SO. The bigger issue here is your relationship with your parent's partner and your friends see that. You can decide to expend energy hating and criticizing this person or take steps to try live together and be civil to one another. Maybe counseling can help.", "yTA..\nThat is not your choice", "YTA. You come across as very immature and very young. Stop yelling at your friends and move out if you can\u2019t handle your parent\u2019s SO.", "ESH. They are honestly really tone deaf and low key silly for suggesting hanging out with her. They know you don\u2019t like her and I assume you guys are younger, yeah you don\u2019t want her hanging around. But seriously you could have been far more polite. No reason to go off on your friends like that.", "NTA!! though im sure they werent aware at all of what they were saying. if you complained about how annoying she is to them, they shouldnt want to invite her. thats just ignoring your feelings for the sake of a free touristic guide. \neven if you yelled at them, you said nothing inherently rude or mean, you simply exaggerated things thay you know she would do, that may annoy you, or them. \n\nthey didnt listen to you even when they know you dont appreciate this person, theyre in the wrong, but you shouldnt yell either, overall, NTA", "YTA. You sound like a hothead. Your friends made a suggestion, not a command or order, and you flipped out.

Your friends (quite correctly) suggested that in a different situation, with different people, you might see another side to her and she might see another side to you as well, and you might actually discover shared interests and even common opinions that just might lead to a better degree of mutual respect.\n\nAs for her advice itself (which is actually EXCELLENT advice), have you ever asked or even considered WHY she is so concerned about skin cancer?  Did she lose somebody she loved to skin cancer?  Has she had to go through treatments and procedures herself?  Does she work in a profession where she sees it regularly?    Or is it just that you'd rather judge her and rant about her than make even a tiny bit of effort?\n\nYou certainly would have been within your rights to decline, nicely.
