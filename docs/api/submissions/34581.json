The cancer she had was found to late, and the doctor's wouldn't have been able to treat it in time, so we were left with limited days we had with her. My mom was my dads whole world, so you could imagine what it was like for him when she passed away. My dad ended up never recovering from her death, and would go days drinking and lashing out at any minor inconvience, he'd sometimes lay his hands on me but would apologise to me afterwards and get me expensive stuff to make up for it. Over some months he started to get really bad, he started to threaten me and would mock everything I would do or say, he even took my door off at one point because he just felt like it. He made me feel unsafe and unloved in my own home for months and made sure that I knew I was the one at fault for everything that went wrong in his life.\n\nI ended up going to live with my grandma afterwards because my father was gradually getting worse everyday, he would threaten me constantly and I just didn't feel safe. There was one night he had to get rushed to the ER for alcohol posioning, and that was when I knew I didn't want to be there or him to be in my life anymore. Since I was a minor, I needed someone to take care of me so I went to my aunt on my moms side and begged her to take me in because I didn't feel safe in my home or with my dad, I told her everything that happened and she took me in immediately. My dad didn't seem to care and I think even at one point he told people he was glad I was gone and that maybe his life would get better now that such an unlucky person was out of his life. My life was really good with my aunt and her family, they made me feel really cherished and loved and made me feel like I belonged, I didn't really see or hear of my dad ever again, the last thing I knew about him was that he was put into therapy and that my grandma was taking care of him. \n\nI unfortunately did end up seeing him one day at my niece's birthday party, my grandma was invited so she ended up inviting my dad too, I wasn't aware of it until after they had both showed up together. When I saw him all I felt was disgust and how bad of a father he was to me for no reason, just because he was hurting doesn't mean I wasn't. He ended up coming over to me a couple hours into the party asking if we could talk and I don't really know what came over me but I lashed out at him telling him that he has no right to come here or even ask for anything considering how much of a douche he was to me when I was younger. I told him that his wife died but my mom died too, I don't really remember what else was said because I was literally having a full blown breakdown in front of everyone but I know it wasn't good. All I remember is that my aunt ended up taking me away from the party and I heard that my grandma said I was in the wrong for doing what I did because my dad was going through a lot, but I was also.

The time to try to make amends is when he realises he messed up. And the place is in private where he's made the effort entirely for you. Just to make a party a little less uncomfortable for himself is not the right place and it's unfair on you to try to use other people being around as a shield to prevent you expressing yourself.", "NTA - You needed to get that off your chest.

Best wishes going forward.", "No you are not. \nYour grandma is wrong. \nWhen your mom died you didn't even get the time to process things and you had to deal with an asshole.

Or has he tried to reach out to you afterwards? \n\nAlso if you do want to talk to him (you don't owe him a conversation) maybe have it with a therapist or someone you trust being around. It's possible he's gotten help for his awful behavior. But it also could have been trying to treat you poorly again. I'm not him so I don't know. But if you do want to try to talk to him just do it somewhere you feel safe. If an apology isn't the first thing he does the rest of the conversation doesn't matter. Not that an apology will fix it but might help you in some way.", "OP is NTA for what they said or did.

The father is obviously an AH. \n\nBut, I do feel conflicted because I know OP didn't really have control of her emotions especially as she is a teen and the trauma lashed out. It unfortunately ruined that kid's birthday. I feel its the father's fault that the birthday was ruined not OP's but I still cant shake off all the blame with it. So a minor AH to the kid I guess?", "NTA.\n\nGrief does terrible things to people. That is never an excuse to be terrible to people.", "NTA - how dare he show up unannounced and think you should talk to him at a celebration after what he did. He is a child abuser and his Mommy is an enabler. Don\u2019t ever look back and do not feel guilty. He traumatized you.", "NTA, he wants to talks about the past - your niece's birthday is not place to do it. And grandma needs to STFU because her own son failed you as a father when your mother died, which he had pretty of opportunity to talk and keep in touch way before the birthday party but purposely chose not to - so you owe neither of those 2 a relationship now due that bullshit.", "NTA. This sounds like an attempt to corner you, and you should be so proud of yourself for not letting him. Please accept a hug from an internet stranger x \n\nI hope you can heal in your own time and at your own pace, but I really think that standing your ground is the right thing to do. He is lucky he isn\u2019t in prison for what he did to you, and he should be extremely ashamed of himself. The decent thing to do would have been for him to not go to the party, the fact he did go and then tried to corner you shows how little he\u2019s learned.", "My mom passed less than a month before my 14 birthday, suddenly. At the funeral, my grandma, my dad's mom, saw me being sad and maybe about to cry and decided that wasn't the right times or thing to do or tbh, idk what she really was thinking or feeling at that moment. I do know that she stormed over to me, forcefully took me away from the room and scolded me. Telling me, a child, who just lost her mom, to toughen up and not look so down and how I better not even think of crying cuz that's just gonna make it all worse, FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, if I did cry. I especially needed to be strong for my dad, her son. A grown man of 40, who had never really showed any of us kids (8 in total) and real types of emotions cuz of the way her and his dad raising him. So it wasn't like my dad was this mess of a person when my mom passed, he kept his emotions in check and did his major morning in private. He loved my mom deeply and never remarried or even dated again. I say all that cuz my grandma had no real reason/need to come at me like that and yet because she did, it affected me deeply. It's been almost 30yrs and I still rmr it so profoundly. It caused me to mask my feelings for anything and everything. I mean, growing up with an emotional distant parent didn't help me know how to express my feelings very well in the first place, but having my grandma tell me that crap at that particular time, made it so much worse. I stopped feeling, pushed any and all feeling out and built a wall high enough to keep them out, good or bad feelings, didn't matter either. I was like that for so many years that when I finally was made to feel emotions, cuz they got so strong and demanded to be felt. They came in the form of panic attacks from overwhelming anxiety and I had no clue how to even deal with them, let alone lone , handle them and definitely not in any type of healthy positive way. Even after all these years I still struggle with it and unfortunately it has affected my ability to have any relationships, regardless of that being romantic, friendship, work, family ect. I wish I could have said something to my grandma before she passed. I'm glad op at least got the chance to get that tiny bit of pain off he's chest and that his dad maybe be at ignorant to the damage that he did to his own son. Like op said, his dad may have lost his wife but op lost his MOM and was the kid going through it as well. His dad was the adult and instead of acting like that, he pretty much abandon op just so he could act like the kid and wallow in his put me pity party. So it's kinda like op  had to deal with losing both parents yet having to deal with the harsh reality that nope, one was actually still around just no longer acted like his parent really. Nta op, don't ever feel bad for making your father face the truth of his actions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad failed you and I'm so sorry for what you went through. It's good that your dad is getting help and he may well be sorry for how he treated you but you are under no obligation to forgive him. He should not have blindsided you at a kid's birthday party like that. If he wanted to reach out and apologise there were much better ways to do that.\nIf he has something to say, he can write a letter, then you can read it or not, respond or not as you feel, on your terms. \n\nFWIW my uncle went a similar way when my aunt died (she was her in her 70s) , drinking, being abusive to my disabled cousin, he ended up being taken into care where he died a few years later.

I managed to get better after some therapy and even work to take my mind off of it.\n\nThe thing I hadn't ever opened up about my mom is she drank a lot too...to the point of calling my father and making death threats.  I'd hear them on the home phones recording.  People asked how I could still love her and it was hard to explain.  \n\nOP I may not know exactly what you're going through but I understand alcohol.  If not used responsibly, it can really mess up things.  NTA, if this exact scenario happened, I'd have a hard time keeping my cool.

All things considered, I'm a bit of an optimist.\n\nSo, that being said, it is possible that your father may be looking to reconcile.\n\nIf it is genuine (assuming he isn't doing it for his mother) it must be done on your terms in your time.\n\nIn the meantime, slowly deep dive into what you are feeling.

Hopefully he has had time to reflect and may have wanted to apologise and be there for you now.

There is no consideration left in me anymore", "Parents who put hands on their children and torment them don't deserve an ounce of fucking slack.", "I think it's a bit early for the OP to extend the olive branch.\n\nFurthermore, OP isn't the one that needs to be the one extending it.", "I understand, every emotion just came running over me and I genuinely just wanted to give him back what he gave me during that time. I know I should have dealt with it better, but seeing him come up to me out of nowhere acting like we were okay just angered me \ud83e\udd72", "I'm sorry, what?  OP should have left?  Really?\n\nHow about dad shouldn't have been there to begin with.", "That's on the dad not OP.", "Hi! I understand what you are saying completely, I guess it happened out of nowhere and was a trauma response, at least that is what my aunt told me. I just felt angered that he came up to me out of nowhere and acted like we were okay after he hurt me for so long. Obviously I have not included every detail, but I do know what you mean. I apologised to my niece when I calmed down and she ended up forgiving me \ud83e\udd72", "Maybe you should research PTSD.", "He may very well have tried to corner you in a \"public\" situation to try to force you to \"behave.\" F that noise. Get louder. Everyone who defends him gets an earful of his worst behaviors. Let them all have it, pet. You deserve the peace and space that breathing fire at them might get you. Or at least the piece of mind getting it out will.", "u/RevolutionaryTip6744 is absolutely right. I agree with every word \ud83d\udc4d\n\nOP, it sounds like you didn't get the opportunity to grieve because you were having to deal with your dad's ab-se. As a parent, I have to prioritise my son - that's what I signed up for when I became his mother. Your dad is no different. He should have prioritised you. The fact that he didn't is \\*his\\* fault, not yours.\n\nA combination of his ab-se and your unaddressed grief would make \\*anyone\\* break down. Do not blame yourself for telling your father what you needed to tell him - that was your right.\n\nit sounds like your grandmother is more concerned with what makes her life easier than holding her son accountable. Her refusal to make him take responsibility for his actions is probably why he handled everything so poorly - she enabled him and his self-centeredness.\n\nIt sounds like you could do with some grief counselling because of how poorly things were handled early on. But, if you get to a point where you are questioning yourself again, ask yourself this - if it was someone else in the same circumstances, would you blame them? Sometimes, if we take away the emotion of it being \"our problem\", we can see things more clearly.\n\nSending you a big hug and heartfelt condolences on the loss of your mother \ud83d\udc95", "You are absolutely not in the wrong here. Your dad failed you in every way after you mom died. You may want to consider therapy though, not for his sake or to fix that relationship but for your own. I sounds like both your mom's death and your father abject failure have left you with some deep wounds that haven't healed yet. So to heal your own heart, for your own happiness, maybe find a professional and talk this through with, just to get clearer with yourself about how you feel.", "You weren't in the wrong for what you said. It's the first time you saw him in a long time after being basically abandoned and it's obvious that you needed to get the anger and hurt off of your chest to help you heal. He needed to step up as a parent and failed. Maybe he's finally in a better spot and knows how badly he fucked up. He can never make it right. You are feeling regret,  maybe because he's still your father.  Only you can decide if you want any contact with him. You've calmed down now, maybe you want to give him 5 minutes of your time and see what he has to say, who knows, you might be able to have some sort of relationship with him in the future. At least a civil one because he will still be a part of the extended family. You can never get those negative years back. It sounds like you might benefit from going to therapy to help deal with the anger. I wish you well", "I agree 1000% with what u/RevolutionaryTip6744 said.  But, I beg you to get therapy if you haven't already.  Your total AH of a \"father\" richly deserved everything you said.  What I ask for is 100% for you.\n\nBut the depth of pain still inside you will affect you in unexpected ways even if you never see your \"father\" again.    And, obviously, I would advise you not to go to any situations where your grandma is invited.  Because she literally doesn't see the problem and, in her eyes, believes you should reconcile.", "People supporting you are 1000% right. And UGH on your grandmother (his mom?) for taking his side over a child. They deserve each other.", "Agree.  And I\u2019m wondering why after all these years he finally decides to try to mend with the daughter at someone else\u2019s birthday party?  He could have reached out at anytime, since OP was still with family members he knows.  He sounds very self-involved, imho.  Maybe if he sticks with therapy his provider can help him do proper outreach to mend the relationship, but until then, he needs to fix himself more before he tried to fix things with his child and OP has every right to still be angry.\n\nSeeing a counselor themselves just to have someone without any ties to the family who can be a sounding board may help OP in terms of just getting all this off their chest & able to handle any encounters with Dad in the future a little better.  Not saying OP has to talk to Dad right now, just might be able to give better toolset for dealing with his presence as Grandma may bring him round and try to play go-between again.  Counselor/therapist may also help you see how Grandma may be an enabler (I get hints of that in some of what you\u2019ve written).  Good luck and no, you are NTA but your Grandma may be.", "If you need some perspective, your dad could (and IMO, SHOULD) go to prison for how he treated you. Do NOT feel guilty! You\u2019re letting him off extremely easy, which I get, police reports and trials and stuff are hard and you might not want to report your dad, but remember that. He could be in prison right now. He\u2019s not. He should be thankful you\u2019re so nice.", "Nice, you deserve better than him", "Some people do things like that with people around hoping you'll avoid making a scene. You deserve a concerted effort made just for you and in a way you can be comfortable telling him exactly how you feel.", "I would suggest letting your family know that you don't want him anywhere near you and that they should plan events accordingly.  As I said in a previous post, therapy could be helpful, as well as journaling.\n\nStart small, take your time, be patient with yourself, don't let your healing overwhelm you.", "Confusion...", "I don't think you really understand what I said.", "That's basically what I said. Through time hopefully they can work through it together to attempt to patch their relationship. Learn to read", "Thank you so much!!!", "Good for you. Don\u2019t let these redditors try and change your mind. You know how he treated you. You know you\u2019re better off without him.", "Dad asked if they could talk, OP is the one who had a \"full blown breakdown.\" But I know OP is a kid and their dad is awful, that's why soft.", "I can honestly see that, I only see him as this tyrant now that I cannot imagine any sincere intentions coming from him. My aunt has been the biggest help through all of this, and I maybe one day will sit down with him and my grandma and let everything out. Thank you for supporting me <3", "What is ab-se?", "Honestly, you're right. If he does anything else to me, or tries to quiet me down or corner me, I'll make sure to keep in mind of this. Thank you so much", "You definitely need some grief counseling to help you deal with the unresolved feelings to help you move on. You don't need that anger simmering in the background going forward", "A word missing the vowel in the middle", "Abuse. Silly way of censoring it.", "Abuse. Don't know why they're censoring the word.", "Of course! I hope everything goes well for you<33", "That IS silly. There are better ways to do that so people don't think it's a new acronym. \ud83d\ude44", "Probably because that makes this post go against sub rules. I'm actually surprised it's still up at all.", "I censor it because it can be a trigger for some people. The vast majority of people know what the word is, whilst those who are triggered by it don't have to be. You can call that \"silly\" if you wish, but I find it respectful and have been told by many survivors that they find it respectful - which is why I use, and will continue to use, that form of censorship.", "I had a thing on my laptop to censor certain triggering words, but it didn't work when people put an astrix or other symbol in the word. this was a couple years ago so maybe there's ones that censor with symbols now, but just to make you aware!", "Just for the record, most people with serious triggers will block or filter the words related to them. If you don\u2019t actually use the word, they can\u2019t do that.", "I appreciate the heads-up. I will discuss it as, due to the nature of my job, I deal with survivors regularly. They have always thanked me for censoring it and are the reason I censor the central letter (an app one patient uses to avoid trigger words allows for censorship of the central letter - or central two if it's an word with an even number of letters). I will check with them to see if that information is still up-to-date and relevant.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to let me know.", "That's true for those who are further down the road to recovery and have received support enough to know about their triggers and how to handle them. However, experience tells me those are in the minority. The vast majority of people who struggle with this either haven't received support yet or are not in a position to deal with things fully. When 90% of the patients I deal with tell me that self-censorship helps them, I'm going to censor it for them. If you look at these apps and the number or downloads they've had, that number is vastly lower than the estimated number of people who struggle with this.", "that sounds like a much better way, always thought it was silly of the extension I had to not allow for symbols, seems very short sighted. though they've likely updated things in the past couple years so maybe my comment is irrelevant. if you know the name of the app, I'd be grateful to know!"]}
