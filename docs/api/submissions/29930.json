When we first started going out, I had a good relationship with my SIL. We would go out for meals and spa days and I'd call her for advice since I respected her opinion.\n\nUnfortunately, 3 years ago, my MIL passed away and my FIL followed a year and a half later. It was really sad for the whole family and this has impacted my SIL negatively. She turned to drinking heavily and our relationship slowly deteriorated. There are lots of events that contributed to this but this was the last straw for me\u2026\n\nI\u2019m after my partner's money, so SIL says.\n\nSo, when my partner and I got together, he was working in a minimum wage job and both his parents were very much alive. He had a modest savings account and that\u2019s all good. I chose him because I love him, not because of how much money he has. I earn more than he has and this isn\u2019t a big deal for me.\n\nNow that both his parents have passed away, he has received a large sum of money. He wants to use the money to buy a house and I support him in this goal. My partner\u2019s SIL kept asking him to create a will and he did. My partner decided I\u2019d get 75% and 25% would go to his nieces and nephews (we have no children). When we buy a house, we'll have to amend the will again.\n\nSIL texted my partner about the will. When she found out I was getting a large amount, she asked if my will would leave everything to my partner too. My partner told her he wasn't sure. and this is where it escalated.\n\nSIL then texted I was the following:\n\n* I\u2019m a lying person\n* I couldn\u2019t wait to get the money when I found out that my partner had an inheritance\n* SIL doesn\u2019t trust my intentions\n* I\u2019m a red-flag\n\nMy partner tried to explain that no one lied and tried to clarify the confusion, but she wasn\u2019t listening. SIL is adamant she is right, saying that my partner also lied to her about the will. At this point, my partner and I were both offended and upset about my SIL.\n\nMy partner tried to speak to SIL another day. When he said to her that I deserved an apology, she just huffed in disapproval and walked away from my partner.\n\nI discussed with my partner if I should reach out to SIL. My partner said that if I did this, he would just get the backlash from her. He\u2019s asked me to leave the issue. As much as I want to bite my SIL's head off, I\u2019m concerned that this would ruin their relationship, so I decided to respect my partner's wishes.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m also not a martyr and I don\u2019t want toxic people in my life. My partner agrees with me and agrees that I deserve an apology. Unfortunately, since SIL is the older sister, she has an \u2018I\u2019m always right\u2019 syndrome so this wasn\u2019t going to happen. So I told my partner, If this can't be resolved, I have to remove SIL from my life. My partner agrees.\n\nNow, she found out that I\u2019ve blocked her and they\u2019re questioning why I\u2019ve done it.
