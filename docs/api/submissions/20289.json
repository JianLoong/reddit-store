My brother popped the question she said yes and then the wedding preparations started, I was so excited because I don\u2019t have any sisters only 2 brothers and I\u2019m also the youngest.

Which I was really excited for , just for context before the wedding we got along good and I kinda liked her, she was pretty nice to me just didn\u2019t really talk to me. So me, my mom and the wife and her 2 other bridesmaid went to the dress shop to look for dresses. She said only requirements is that it has to be red and flowy. I by nature have body image problems so finding a dress to compliment by body was gonna be hard but i was gonna do my best to find one that I liked within her color scheme. We went to 3 different shops and each time we all went plus they added the wife\u2019s mom.

A lot of brides want people in their party that theyce very close to so they can share some intimate memories. It's best not to ask and instead *wait to be asked* - because it's pretty awkward to decline someone. They are older than you and should have just been upfront.\n\n2). Being a bridesmaid means you gotta wear what the bride wants you to wear. It really isn't about what you like. I've been a bridesmaid before in dresses that really didn't suit me or I didn't like them, but I wanted to support the bride so I got on with it and remembered that no one was there to see me. So you were an AH with all thayt, but it's a soft YTA because you are young and I can see you haven't learned this. Nowadays, unless it's someone very close to me, I decline the role of bridesmaid.", "ESH I feel like you or your mother guilted her and your brother to be in the wedding then you spent the whole time dress shopping getting upset about your body. When it comes to a wedding you wait for an invitation for a role, not go round saying telling people what role you want. Would you have responded maturely if they told you they only wanted your brother as part of the wedding party? Or would you have got upset? On the brides side of things she barely knows you. The dress also isn\u2019t about you, I\u2019ve worn some awful dresses for weddings before as the bride wanted matching bridesmaid dresses and non of the styles she chose suited me but it\u2019s not about me or my preferences it\u2019s about her and her wedding. \n\nIf she felt guilted into letting you be a bridesmaid then you spent the whole time saying \u201cI don\u2019t like this/that\u201d I would be pretty annoyed too. Did you want to be in the wedding to support the couple or to dress up to look the best for a party? I would have asked the bride what she thought of each dress rather than saying \u201cI don\u2019t like\u201d every time. You were on dress 5 of shop 3? Not 5dresses in total. How many did you try in the other shops? Had the other bridesmaids chosen theirs? If you\u2019ve tried on 30 dresses for example and still saying you don\u2019t like it then I would definitely be annoyed at you. \n\n\nShe absolutely should not have screamed at you - that is where she is an asshole. She should have told you to stop being negative and pick one of the dresses you\u2019ve already tried but you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.

But she\u2019s 25 years old and nobody is forcing her to go dress shopping with you, and if she didn\u2019t want to deal with it, she could have set better boundaries and put her foot down in a better way, like an adult.

Overall NTA but I could see how they were thinking you are the AH.", "Esh. \nThe bride, for obvious reasons. She should not have yelled and screamed at you like that, that was obviously not okay.\nBut you, you need to recognize that this is not your day. This event is not for you, it's not about you, it's not your thing. So you might end up in a dress that you don't like or doesn't quite flatter your body the way you want it to. That is a risk that you take when you agree to be somebody's bridesmaid. You have already tried on five dresses. I'm going to assume based on the context of the post, all of the other bridesmaids have been okay with at least one of these other dresses, and you're the only one who seems to be holding up the purchase of a dress for everybody, and holding up the wedding planning. How much do you think the bride is really going to be able to focus on everything else when you are taking forever to pick a dress? I completely understand having body image issues, I've struggled with my entire life.

Less stress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople just want something to complain about !!", "Yeah, I think she\u2019d have been happier to go shopping with her mother or a friend, once she found a dress she liked she could always send the bride a picture so she could veto it before buying.", "1000% yes. OP needs to have time to feel comfortable on her own if she has body image issues. Then get the opinion of others. Mother of the bride is virtually a stranger and giving her opinion when OP is vulnerable? Some people might be okay with that but I would not be and OP clearly isn\u2019t. So online shopping is the solution.", "Yeah, I mean if it all went down like OP says the bride was 100% out of line for the screaming and dramatics. That\u2019s why I agreed with the ESH.\n\nI was pointing out the \u201cchill\u201d part because it sounds like OP didn\u2019t actually realize that most of the time you do not get a say in your bridesmaid dress. OP sounded like she thought she was being reasonable in her dress shopping expectations and that the bride was unreasonable for being annoyed. The bride was certainly unhinged if her reaction was as extreme and out of left field as OP says, but OP was also acting incredibly entitled on a bridesmaid dress shopping trip IMO", "Yeah I'm not saying they should've had to include her. Was more reply to the comment about the bride having her own friends etc for the bridal party, despite the fact that the groom likely also has his own people he wants included", "Given she says she later found out bride and mom only took her because they wanted her brother in parry, I don't think thebbrides brother and groom were close either.", "I think it's because often the sister of the groom is the only sib on either side who is excluded, and exclusion doesn't feel good. Some couples want to try to include everyone and others are fine excluding only the groom's sister(s). Even the bride's brothers may end up as ushers if not groomsmen. But there is no corresponding role for including sisters who are not bridesmaids.\n\nAs for the bride \"already [having] her own family and friends,\" that is true but also a wedding is a joining together of two families. The groom's family, including his siblings, is about to become the bride's family too. \n\nIt is for each individual couple to decide how they want to navigate this. Proceeding with kindness, honesty, empathy, and open communication, regardless of what they decide about who will participate in their wedding party, is the way to go when dealing people who are going to be in your family for potentially the rest of your life.", "Because they \u2018aren\u2019t allowed\u2019 to stand up with the groom, same as the bride\u2019s brothers have to be groomsmen, in a lot of places - the person wants their siblings in the wedding party with them but stupid gender rules say they have to stand with the other person. \n\n(I personally think we should just have mixed gender groups on both sides so the bride and groom can both have who they want.)", "I have no idea, lmao. I was honestly relieved NOT to be asked. My MiL was more offended than I was! \ud83e\udd23", "#$10/10", "The bride is an asshole. Adult? Not so much.", "OP admitted to having issues with how she looks. It's a very good possibility that multiple dresses looked great on her, but she didn't see it that way.  I'd get super annoyed, too, if someone couldn't find a dress in 3+ stores.  It's one day while you shouldn't be uncomfortable. You can suck it up and wear something you might not like. \n\nI would never say yelling at a kid over this is okay, but I'd call it a day after the second store, tell mom and the kid to go shopping on their own and send me a picture when they finally find something.", "This is what I hate about weddings, it's not about the couple but about the family.", "\u201cI expected to be the flower girl but was told I was too old\u2026\u201d", "Yeah, she literally says she just wanted to be a flower girl. And if she was too old for that, they could have made her an usher (no rules that say that role always has to be male) or they could have got her to give a reading during the ceremony, I'm sure she'd have been happy with that.", "Maybe where you are that's the case, where I am there are plenty of shops with versions of the same dress in different colours but in different sizes. If no dress fit her, that sounds like a pretty disheartening experience for her. No reason for her to get yelled at.", "I suspect no one told OP this.", "Where I am, the bridesmaid would try the dress on in a different colour and order it in the right colour but you can often try on the style in your size just to know it looks ok. But it sounds like there weren't dresses that she could get on, which would be sucky.", "Yeah, because keeping on saying I'm too fat for this dress to someone who can't put 2 and 2 together is the best solution. \nShe can't wear most type of dresses, and instead of wasting time by saying she'd try them on when she already knew she would not fit in she was just saying they weren't to her liking. Anyone with a bit of brain would know she was trying to save face ffs.", "She said (pardon me, idk how to quote on Reddit in the nice way)  - \"On the 3rd one I kept trying dresses on and simply kept trying to find one that fit me (also never being rude or giving up I just Nicely politely said I didn't like it)\" - I took that part to mean that she was trying to find dresses that fit.", "If you read the post, she was trying to be polite by saying that. The real reason was the dresses didn't fit.", "It seemed from her post that she wasn't able to get dresses on her though?", "Difference between being irritated and yelling at a person.", "If it were my bridesmaid I wouldn't mind, but I also wouldn't make someone my bridesmaid that I don't actually like. ESH. OP is 18 so I'm more directing this at her mom, mom should've said \"we can go sometime just us two and find a dress\" and just go off of what the other bridesmaids got, then get final approval from bride. \n\nMaybe there's some huge issue with that idea but it sounds like it'd be a lot better than the result that happened.", "She needs one she deems comfortable, though. If that's not possible for the wedding plan for some reason, then a discussion should happen in which she is politely asked to step out of that role. If the bride is just exasperated that she's taking too long to look, there are far more mature solutions than starting a fight and throwing around the \"ruined my wedding\".", "It has to at least fit her comfortably though, regardless of whether it\u2019s a style she really loves or not. I\u2019d honestly rather not be a bridesmaid than have to wear a dress I felt uncomfortable or self conscious in.", "This is what I plan to do too!!", "OP is 18, and clearly an immature 18 at that (ex: wanting to be a flower girl, which is usually done by a much younger child). OP is being fussy about dresses shes actually trying on. What if she finds a dress online, it gets ok\u2019d, it arrives, and then oops I don\u2019t like this one either? The online route may be feasible for sensible adults but it doesn\u2019t really seem like thats OP. Bride shouldn\u2019t have to stress indefinitely over one high maintenance bridesmaid, weddings are stressful enough as is. OP doesn\u2019t seem to understand the day is not about her whatsoever. If she can\u2019t figure it out and suck it up if she can\u2019t find a dress like everyone else then she just needs to bow out of the wedding party.", "I know nothing about shopping for a dress as a bridesmaid but if (for instance) the OP is too plus size to find a dress that fits reasonably then how is that her fault?", "True, thank you for the different perspective. Personally, I\u2019ve always been of the opinion that I would rather be a guest and have the freedom to enjoy the wedding without the stress and added pressures. I wouldn\u2019t;t be offended to be excluded, but I can see where some would.", "That would be the perfect solution.", "They absolutely can have their opposite gendered siblings stand with them on their side, it's called having a grooms-woman instead of a groomsman. \nIt may not be popular, it may not be normalized, but it is an option that people can consider. No one is stopping you from doing it. It's not illegal. It's just not normal for people to do.", "So what?  The bride said OP can choose her dress as long as it's a certain color. There was no reason whatsoever the bride needed to go to these shops.  Ah she easily could have said hey, i have some other things i need to handle,  send me a pic of the dress you love when you find it so i can make sure it fits the idea i have if it got to be too much for her. OP could try on 674 dresses if she wants.", "> OP admitted to having issues with how she looks. It's a very good possibility that multiple dresses looked great on her, but she didn't see it that way. \n\n\u2026 which does not mean that the OP sucks. But thanks for playing.", "Dresses can be altered to fit, and quite usually are with bridesmaids dresses. OP admits having body image issues and said she didn\u2019t like them. Honestly going to 3 different shops and trying on upwards of 15 dresses is obnoxious.", "That's not abnormal in wedding dress shops.", "I got married more than a decade ago but I wouldn't have dared to shout at my future in-laws because it's not how things are done in my culture. As I married their older brother, there would be other ways to get back at them. I always play the long game.", "I didn't have any bridesmaids when I got married because I got married out of state and really didn't want to deal with other people. It was easier to focus on myself, my husband and our parents (culturally the wedding is more for the parents celebrating and showing off so the guest list is usually 80% relatives and their friends lol).", "She isn't going to find a dress that fits at the shop. You find one where you like the style, they clamp you into it because most of the sample sizes are small and then you order the size you need.", "If she\u2019s not been to a wedding for a long time she might have been confused between flower girl and bridesmaid. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s totally normal for someone to be fussy about what they are going to wear in front of their entire family and a bunch of strangers. The wedding obviously isn\u2019t about OP but she is allowed to feel comfortable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bride should have either chosen the dress for her (and not accepting the dress means not being bridesmaid) or let OP choose her own dress that is bride approved after selecting. If OP changes her mind after it arrives then that\u2019s her problem, she can wear it or drop out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for some reason a massive production was made about a relatively unimportant dress. If OP insisted they all shop together then she\u2019s be an AH too but I am under the impression it was brides choice therefore bride is solely the AH.", "Same. In general I do not enjoy the bridesmaid role, with a couple exceptions when the bride has been one of my closest friends.", "The bride is normally involved in picking bridesmaids' dresses. Her being there makes perfect sense. When OP realized nothing was looking right, SHE or HER MOTHER should have called it.  The bride already didn't want to deal with her, probably for a reason similar to this. The bride probably also didn't want to deal with the hate she would have gotten for leaving early. She was wasting HER time to help OP feel included. If OP is too old to be a flower girl and identify that she has body image issues, she's old enough to know when she is being difficult.  \n\nHonestly, I would have snapped long before shop number 3 dress number 5. Dress shopping isn't easy, but at that point, OP was making it about herself.  If you've never been through the process, my guess is they were at probably hour 4 of shopping at that point. Most people would snap by then.", "No, what makes her suck is her dragging out a process when she KNOWS it's highly unlikely she'll find something she likes. Sometimes, you suck it up and wear something you don't like. Bridesmaids' dresses are known for being ugly, unflattering, and never worn again.  This isn't a new joke. It's hard to find a dress that flatters multiple body types.  The bride was pretty open with the choices. OP was being difficult.", "Shes 18, that is a senior in high school or a graduate. Unless there are developmental delays (possible) she knows the difference. You understand there are time constraints for weddings right? The bride shouldn\u2019t have to be at the mercy of one picky bridesmaid. The bride shouldn\u2019t have to worry about changing bridesmaids down the road because one can\u2019t figure out a dress.", "Tons of projection and what-if in there, and I bet you\u2019re quite the bully"]}
