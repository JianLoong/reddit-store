Him and his fianc\u00e9 (now wife) have been together for almost 4 -5 years and they obvi are about to get married. She is 1 year younger than him just for context. My brother popped the question she said yes and then the wedding preparations started, I was so excited because I don\u2019t have any sisters only 2 brothers and I\u2019m also the youngest. So my brother asked our half brother(30yr old)  to be in his wedding and also his wife brother (16yr old) to be the best man and groomsmen. I just wanted to be the flower girl but they said I was too old\u2026 so instead the wife said you could be a bridesmaid. Which I was really excited for , just for context before the wedding we got along good and I kinda liked her, she was pretty nice to me just didn\u2019t really talk to me. So me, my mom and the wife and her 2 other bridesmaid went to the dress shop to look for dresses. She said only requirements is that it has to be red and flowy. I by nature have body image problems so finding a dress to compliment by body was gonna be hard but i was gonna do my best to find one that I liked within her color scheme. We went to 3 different shops and each time we all went plus they added the wife\u2019s mom. On the 3rd one I kept trying dresses on and simply kept trying to find one that fit me (also never being rude or giving up I just Nicely politely said I didn\u2019t like it) I\u2019m on like the 5th one when all of a sudden the bride starts screaming at me saying \u201c why are you trying to ruin my wedding, what\u2019s wrong with you\u2026. Ect\u2026.. \u201c I start crying and then HER MOM starts screaming at me saying why would you make my daughter cry and etc\u2026. My mom goes outside to talk to them and then the bride cusses my mom out and her mom cussed her out\u2026.. then I find out later they did not want me in the wedding to begin with, they invited me in because they both wanted their brothers to be in it but not me\u2026 so AITA for \u201cruining her wedding\u201d", "created_utc": 1687410744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fu5mv/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_new_wifes_wedding/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Count yourself lucky that you got out of the bridal party early.", "Do you happen to know the reason why she did not want you to be there?", "I always wonder why sisters of the groom expect to be part of the wedding party. That rarely happens since the bride has her own family and friends to consider. It was nice of her to include her. Bridesmaids also rarely get much input in the dresses, so you also lucked out there. It\u2019s not your place to be that picky - five dresses is a lot to veto - but that being said she shouldn\u2019t have gone off on you like she did. There are more polite ways to address unruly bridesmaids. \n\nProbably best to step down from the wedding party and enjoy it as a guest. Less pressure all round.\n\nESH", "ESH because if I was the bride and one of my bridesmaid was being this fussy, I would get annoyed.\n\nThree shops and you couldn't find a dress because you have body image issues and on top of that you are someone I didn't really want in my bridal party... Yeah, I can see why the Bride lost it.\n\nThat said, the Bride should not have asked you if she didn't really want you and also should have stopped the trip when it became clear you were going to be difficult.\n\nAs the bride, she had all the control but instead of exercising any, she chose to blow up on you and that's not okay.", "Soft ESH she should have given you a bit more grace and not gone straight to *screaming* at you, that was awful, but honestly the mature thing to do would just be to find a dress that matched the theme and wear it. \n\nThe day is not about you and everyone knows bridesmaids dresses kind of suck. If it were me I\u2019d be frustrated too. I don\u2019t like shopping at the best of times. Even when I was the *bride* I went to ONE shop because going to three would have driven me absolutely bananas.\n\nYou were being difficult. She overreacted. ESH.", "Soft ESH. \n\nYour problems are heavily affecting the wedding plans. Five shops is a lot to go to. It's very likely everyone else was happy with the dresses, even one that they thought looked good on you, far sooner than the fifth shop, but now they have to keep hunting because of you, with no sight in end. \n\nThe ideal bridesmaid would have sucked it up and worn a dress they didn't like if the bride liked it (within reason). \n\nAnd of course the bride and her mom are AHs for blowing up at you instead of finding a solution.", "It's been a while since I've shopped for bridesmaids dresses, but I'm pretty sure we went to at least three shops and tried on a fair number of dresses. You got bridesmaids with different body shapes, it takes a while.\n\nThat being said, when you're a bridesmaid sometimes you end up in a dress that doesn't suit you very well but which makes the bride happy. OMG, that pink satin number I wore one time. Yikes! But the bride adored it and thought I looked great, so I wore it. (Spoiler--I didn't look great.)\n\nIt sounds as if everybody overreacted, but there is no excuse for the bride telling you that she didn't want you in her party. That was just mean.", "NTA.   \n\n\nWow, she went from 'flowy dresses' to 'flowing with rage' real quick! Talk about an overreaction", "NTA\n\nBUT...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you want to be so involved with someone you \"kinda like\"?. I mean she is someone who has been in your life for up to 5 years. I get that it is your brothers wedding too but being bridesmaid is A LOT of time with the bride, not the groom.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ruin her wedding; it hasn't even happened yet.  You were only trying to find a dress that fitted you nicely.  \n\nYour FSIL is being a bit of AH for screaming not only at you but your mother as well, and them multiplied that with her AH mother joining in the screaming at everyone.\n\nEven worse if you didn't specifically ask to be in the wedding party.", "NTA. When at the wedding, put the open bar out of business.", "NTA but it sounds like she never wanted you in the party so you will have to settle for being a guest.  Wear whatever you want then\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky one with brothers getting married - the bride chooses her party but it sounds like some pressure was brought to her about putting you in.  It\u2019s unfortunate but no one should have people standing for them out of obligation.  You need to swallow your pride on this one.", "NTA. Betcha she\u2019s pregnant though.", "NTA\n\nBut I would step down from being bridesmaid as she\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t want you as one.

Maybe you don't really want to be part of the wedding party now that the bride's true feelings have been exposed.

Honestly, she needs to calm the heck down or elope if that's going to cause her to scream at her future sister-in-law. \n\nDefinitely don't be in their wedding party and keep your distance from this woman, while always remaining polite and respectful but putting boundaries in place. Don't let her walk all over you. There's a good chance this marriage won't last; she sounds like a horror-show and very shallow.\n\n(She could've at some point politely ended the day by saying she was feeling tired -- and asking you to continue shopping with your mom. )", "Gosh, yes! You're well out of this, OP. You'll have other opportunities to be a bridesmaid (and honestly, it's not that much fun).\n\nNTA", "I suspect we are missing quite a bit from the story.", "The bride is a whole-ass adult. If she didn\u2019t want OP in the wedding she could have left her out or given her another smaller role (read a poem in the ceremony, etc) and moved on with her life. She could use her words like a grownup.  She doesn\u2019t need to have a fucking meltdown in the store if she is frustrated with OPs indecision, because again, she is an ADULT. Could OP be more decisive? Sure.  But she\u2019s young and having body image issues is tough, especially when you feel like you\u2019re going to be on display in front of your whole family and a bunch of near-strangers. \n\nBrides don\u2019t get to throw tantrums and be psychotic because of their Speshullll DAYYYYyyy.  \n\nNTA.", "Yeah, I totally agree!", "> Five shops is a lot to go to.\n\nSlight correction, if I'm reading the post correctly, they were at the 3rd shop on the 5th dress at that shop. That said I tend to agree with you.", "It's hard to be sure because of the poor writing in the OP, but the title and part of the post indicate the wedding has happened and they are married now.", "Some brides simply aren\u2019t close or friendly enough with a future SiL to want them in the wedding party. No drama or secret dirt necessary. My FSiL did not ask me to be in her bridal party (hubs is best man)- we have a perfectly cordial relationship but we aren\u2019t close by any means and I\u2019m not offended in the slightest \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Really? Because 5 shops is nothing in a search for the perfect dress!", "Oh, you're correct, thank you.", "Could be but the way I read the post, the bride to be screamed \"why are you trying to ruin my wedding\" at the dress shop when the OP couldn't find a dress to wear.", "This is what I don\u2019t get. Why do sisters of grooms believe they are automatically in the running for bridesmaid for a woman that already has her own family and friends?", "For the bride. Bridesmaid not so much. Going to 3 shops because one person has body image problems would make me irritated.", "The bridesmaid doesn't need a dress that *she* deems perfect.", "For a bride? Yes. The wedding dress can take even longer. But for the bridesmaid maybe no? That being said this is just my personal opinion.", "For the bride's dress sure. If the bride's happy with any of those 5 dresses for the bridesmaids then that's what the bridesmaids dress is - in my experience and I don't think that's incorrect address, espec if the bridesmaid' not being singled out and told to wear something different for whatever reason.\n\nTrying on 5 different dresses because the bridesmaid doesn't like them does sound entitled. Not her wedding, if she's not happy to wear a dress that she hasn't chosen/wearing the chosen dress isn't healthy for her, she needs to drop out the wedding party and go as a guest with full choice over what she wears.\n\nETA: apologies if you were being sarcastic and I replied super seriously \ud83d\ude05", "Yes, I see that, but other places she says they're already married, so the whole bridesmaid dress fiasco had to be some time ago. Of course, the OP never wrote if she was still a bridesmaid, who attended the wedding if everyone was fighting at the bridal shop, etc."]}
