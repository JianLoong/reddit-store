My brother popped the question she said yes and then the wedding preparations started, I was so excited because I don\u2019t have any sisters only 2 brothers and I\u2019m also the youngest.

Which I was really excited for , just for context before the wedding we got along good and I kinda liked her, she was pretty nice to me just didn\u2019t really talk to me. So me, my mom and the wife and her 2 other bridesmaid went to the dress shop to look for dresses. She said only requirements is that it has to be red and flowy. I by nature have body image problems so finding a dress to compliment by body was gonna be hard but i was gonna do my best to find one that I liked within her color scheme. We went to 3 different shops and each time we all went plus they added the wife\u2019s mom.

Don't let her walk all over you.

She could use her words like a grownup.  She doesn\u2019t need to have a fucking meltdown in the store if she is frustrated with OPs indecision, because again, she is an ADULT. Could OP be more decisive? Sure.

No drama or secret dirt necessary.

Going to 3 shops because one person has body image problems would make me irritated.", "The bridesmaid doesn't need a dress that *she* deems perfect.", "For a bride? Yes. The wedding dress can take even longer. But for the bridesmaid maybe no? That being said this is just my personal opinion.", "For the bride's dress sure. If the bride's happy with any of those 5 dresses for the bridesmaids then that's what the bridesmaids dress is - in my experience and I don't think that's incorrect address, espec if the bridesmaid' not being singled out and told to wear something different for whatever reason.\n\nTrying on 5 different dresses because the bridesmaid doesn't like them does sound entitled. Not her wedding, if she's not happy to wear a dress that she hasn't chosen/wearing the chosen dress isn't healthy for her, she needs to drop out the wedding party and go as a guest with full choice over what she wears.\n\nETA: apologies if you were being sarcastic and I replied super seriously \ud83d\ude05", "Yes, I see that, but other places she says they're already married, so the whole bridesmaid dress fiasco had to be some time ago.

You\u2019re 18 and probably not very self-aware yet; flaws included.", "INFO: doesn't change my vote but are you talking about 5 dresses between the three shops or this was the fifth dress at just this third shop not including the other 2 shops?\n\nAlso, any idea why the bride may not like you? There may be no actual issue, it could be that she was pressured to include you in the bridal party and had to boot someone she's closer to for it or something.\n\nEdit: All right, I'm pretty sure I read the numbers right at this point.\n\nESH. You tried on like a dozen dresses in three different shops, appointments where several people needed to take time off work, off life, go to...for a bridesmaid dress. Not even a specific one. And not including alterations and shit. That's a LOT for a bridesmaid. For future reference it doesn't matter how you feel about the dress, so long as the bride likes it. She was giving you a lot of leeway here to try and ensure you feel comfortable but like, if nothing seems to fit your bill with the only 2 requirements she had I'd start getting annoyed too.  Especially when you say it was three shops but on three different days and EVERYONE had to go every time. \n\nThe bride and her mother definitely acted in a way that is unbecoming and frankly could cause long term damage to the family relationships before she even marries your brother. That's unfortunate. Idc what happened, there's very few situations that call goes a scene like this and this isn't it.\n\nAlso you mother. Your mother didn't bother trying to reign this in after the second shop? Didn't say anything at all about your pickiness, try and explain this to you? My mother would never let thus go on like that, and I was my sisters bridesmaid at both weddings, age 14 the first time. No ma'am this would have been shut down way before what happened to you.", "ESH\n\nSometimes you just have to wear something even if you don't like how it looks, because the event isn't about you. This was one of those instances\n\nHowever, the way they went off on you was disgusting, and I'm worried about the marriage your brother's about to get into", "You're very young and I understand why you wanted to be part of the wedding.\n\nHowever a couple of things that would be important to learn.\n\n1) if you don't have a close relationship with the bride, then not being asked to be part of her wedding party isn't a slight on you. A lot of brides want people in their party that theyce very close to so they can share some intimate memories. It's best not to ask and instead *wait to be asked* - because it's pretty awkward to decline someone. They are older than you and should have just been upfront.\n\n2). Being a bridesmaid means you gotta wear what the bride wants you to wear. It really isn't about what you like. I've been a bridesmaid before in dresses that really didn't suit me or I didn't like them, but I wanted to support the bride so I got on with it and remembered that no one was there to see me. So you were an AH with all thayt, but it's a soft YTA because you are young and I can see you haven't learned this. Nowadays, unless it's someone very close to me, I decline the role of bridesmaid.", "ESH I feel like you or your mother guilted her and your brother to be in the wedding then you spent the whole time dress shopping getting upset about your body. When it comes to a wedding you wait for an invitation for a role, not go round saying telling people what role you want. Would you have responded maturely if they told you they only wanted your brother as part of the wedding party? Or would you have got upset? On the brides side of things she barely knows you. The dress also isn\u2019t about you, I\u2019ve worn some awful dresses for weddings before as the bride wanted matching bridesmaid dresses and non of the styles she chose suited me but it\u2019s not about me or my preferences it\u2019s about her and her wedding. \n\nIf she felt guilted into letting you be a bridesmaid then you spent the whole time saying \u201cI don\u2019t like this/that\u201d I would be pretty annoyed too. Did you want to be in the wedding to support the couple or to dress up to look the best for a party? I would have asked the bride what she thought of each dress rather than saying \u201cI don\u2019t like\u201d every time. You were on dress 5 of shop 3? Not 5dresses in total. How many did you try in the other shops? Had the other bridesmaids chosen theirs? If you\u2019ve tried on 30 dresses for example and still saying you don\u2019t like it then I would definitely be annoyed at you. \n\n\nShe absolutely should not have screamed at you - that is where she is an asshole. She should have told you to stop being negative and pick one of the dresses you\u2019ve already tried but you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. With her shouting at your mother I would imagine she is a lot to do with why you got that reaction.", "INFO: were you saying what the problem was with each dress? Like, did they know it was body image issues? Or it didn\u2019t fit right? Or were you just like, \u201cnope. Don\u2019t like it.\u201d ?

I completely understand having body image issues, I've struggled with my entire life. However, I also recognize that If I'm going to be somebody's bridesmaid I'm going to have to risk looking absolutely horrible because they want me in a specific style, whether it looks good on me or not, whether I can find a dress that I like or not. That's what you sign up for when you become a bridesmaid. Is the potential of wearing an ugly ass dress, and doing it with a smile on your face.\n\nYou could have always asked her if you could bring something to change into after photos and the ceremony were done, so that you can be more comfortable, or so that you can be happy with your outfit, and then chosen address that you may not have liked very much but could have dealt with.

Then once a dress is picked, they take your measurements and order you a dress and from there you can alter it more.

You go along with what the bride wants, within reason of course. \nBut your SIL and her mother went from 0 to 100 way too fast with the yelling.

It's pretty harsh to receive all this behavior for the bride to be, so I'm sorry that have to go through this.

Just my opinion.", "NTA they were just being crazy to make you bail. Can you talk to your brother about this and ask his advice? Trying on 5 dresses isn't unreasonable. My gosh, I think my sister tried on about 20 pairs of jeans or more shopping the other day because she wanted my opinion and was trying to work out the best style/colour after losing some weight. I had accepted her invitation to go jeans shopping so for me, it was about hanging out with my sister and giving her honest feedback (5 pairs were awesome).

Some of us that are considerably older, that have not been involved in weddings or been in a wedding party, don't understand the expectations.\n\nNTA.

All that to say, the OP might be putting way too much on this experience (and like at 18, I think that\u2019s super understandable), but the bride should have picked out the dresses or let them order on Azazie or something.

Two schools of thought here. First is, the bride picks the bridesmaids dress she likes without any consideration to whether or not the bridesmaids will like it or whether or not it will suit their bodies. When I got married I went the other way and actually took into consideration all four of my girls, their body sizes, shapes and colours that would suit them, and I designed a dress that would look good on all four of them. \n\nI know not everybody thinks that way, and of course I wouldn't have chosen a dress that I hated, but to be honest if my friends weren't comfortable on my wedding day then I wasn't going to be comfortable either.

The two adult men (30-40's) were dressed in white tuxes and had fanny packs with petals and they played different music (only while they walked down the aisle) and they \"tossed\" the petals.  Sometimes I think people stress themselves over weddings too much.  They just need to make it fun and a celebration of their families blending and two lives joining.  I skipped a wedding after my planning kept getting hijacked by people - not paying for it nor really being people I wanted to try and take mine over.  I eloped in a fiery red dress with one of the judges I worked with and called it a day.  My ring was from Wally world (the wedding band not the engagement ring).

You asked to be the flower girl, which is a bit weird as you\u2019re an adult. I get that you\u2019re the only girl and the youngest, but only a few couples would do that and very few brides would be willing to put a grown adult in a white dress for their wedding. \n\nI get that the invite was a all the other siblings so we need to include everyone deal.

You a bit, 5 dresses that you tried on and there were probably more that you didn't. That is a lot specially if the others had already found a dress.

To start she should not have had you in the wedding if she didn't want you in it. I know it sucks but it's better than including you and mistreating you. Then to have a total outburst and cuss you and your mom out along with her mother is totally rude and uncalled for. I understand she is frustrated because she has a ton of things to worry about in preparation for the wedding and to keep going dress shopping with a picky teen sounds exhausting but she should have spoken up sooner and spoke to your mom separately. You could have gone shopping along with your mom and not included SIL until you found one or two dresses that might work but instead SIL let her frustration build to the boiling point.  Then she had a melt down. \n\nTo clarify you didn't ruin the wedding, because it hasn't happened.  At this point you both contributed to the bad situation.  It would be best if you were not in the wedding.  And hopefully she apologizes for how she handled it. \nAs far not wanting you in the wedding, many women have their ideal wedding in their heads since they were little so don't take it so personally if her version didn't include you or anyone outside her circle.

Why they didn't want you there in the first place? Is she just an ahole, or is this not the first time this happens? Maybe because you are too young, you have not realized this is a behavior that you tend to have to make it about you. If they don't want you there, do not impose your presence in her bridal party. The expectation of her becoming your sister sister might be one sided. Just keep a cordial relationship with her and that would be enough.

I have 2 moms, first Mom went to 1 store for her dress and I think she said she tried on 2-3? second Moms best friend bought her dress. the fact that the bride let her bridesmaids have this much say in their dress, let alone going to 3 different stores trying on at least 5 different dresses at store 3 alone for someone she didnt really want as a bridesmaid? unheard of\n\nyou knew you had body image issues, but as a bridesmaid you find a dress that the bride likes whether or not you like it.

Bridesmaids dresses don\u2019t fit great in the shop - it\u2019s just so you can see how the style works and then they order it in your size.\n3.  It\u2019s odd that you wanted to be the flower girl and asked to be that (plus it\u2019s rude as I stated). \n4.  Their wedding isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about them. You likely tried on a dozen gowns and still didn\u2019t like any of them. How frustrating for the bride. Something that should\u2019ve been fun turned into something all about you.  When you\u2019re a bridesmaid - don\u2019t make things difficult for a bride. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with ESH - because the bride and her mom were out of pocket, but you were also in the wrong for pushing to be in the wedding and then being so picky about a dress.\n\nMost of your mistakes appear to be na\u00efvet\u00e9 and inexperience with this sort of thing.\n\nI would bow out of the wedding party tbh.

Did you tell them you want to be in the wedding or did they tell you they wanted to but didn\u2019t know where to put you? Because it seems like you forced your way in. How many dresses did you try on before she blew up? Was it more than she tried on for her actual wedding dress? How many did others try on before they were fine with it?

Because you liking the dress isn\u2019t the point of being a bridesmaid. Hell in any wedding I\u2019ve ever been to the bridesmaids looked horrible. That\u2019s kinda a low blow to take, but it helps the bride shine on her and her husband\u2019s day. It\u2019s THEIR wedding. It\u2019s a day that you\u2019ll forget all about eventually, but they will remember every time they have an anniversary, a special life moment like kids.

Your best friend pushed for it, so you said sure. Then the little sibling started making things hectic by vetoing things because of their preference instead of yours.

You for dragging the entire party out to three different shops only for there to be no progress or decisions. I assume if you had tried on at least 5 dresses at the third store, then you probably tried on at least a dozen (or two) dresses in total between all three. After a while, I\u2019m sure it was tiring and irritating to be dragged behind you through multiple stores because you\u2019re the only one that couldn\u2019t make a decision. The waiting around and commuting between stores takes up a lot of time. You could\u2019ve done some research about what types of dresses the shops had and picked out a few things that you thought would be a good fit. Or done some shopping independently and show the bride afterwards.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t condone your sister in law at all for screaming at you (with her mother), since it seemed uncalled for, there must be some reason or background information for as to why she didn\u2019t want you participating in the wedding.

She was already being polite by letting you choose a style that you liked (plenty of brides just choose their bridesmaids dresses for them).", "ESH\n\nIf she was frustrated that you were taking so long to pick a dress, she should have communicated that she was getting frustrated and asked you to please just settle for something that fit because it was tiring her out too much to keep looking.\n\nThat having been said, you really should have been more aware of what a strain it was to take so long to choose a dress. The bride was probably trying o be patient and couldn't hold it in any longer. I have ADHD and am bad with time management and making decisions so I absolutely understand how this could have gotten away from you without you realizing it, but I think you should also be understanding of how exhausting it was for her to  try and keep it together for you when she was proably barely ok with the situation to begin with.\n\nI understand that she hurt your feelings by telling you she never wanted you in the wedding and I will say her mother was absolutely in the wrong for blowing up at you AFTER THE BRIDE HAD ALREADY, but I can also understand how the bride felt. She knew it was the right thing to do to include you in the wedding party but you 2 aren't close and she was probably really holding in her discomfort and just snapped when she felt like you were taking up too much of their time.\n\nI think everyone else handled the situation horribly as opposed to you just being unintentionally inconsiderate, but I also think you inadvertandly pushed things until they hit a breaking point.

You don't sound like a nice person. Your whole vibe is off. You corned her into asking you to be a bridesmaid by asking to be the flower girl. Obviously you knew they wouldn't make you a flower girl. Now, you are giving her a hard time about the dresses. This isn't about you. Apologize to the bride and tell her you will either bow out of the wedding or will wear whatever dress she chooses.

If it\u2019s the latter, that takes a good chunk of the responsibility off of you, but not all of. When you say you were trying to find a dress that fit, did you really mean fit or do you mean look flattering? I\u2019m willing to be wrong if you tell me that the dresses were absolutely horrific, but it does seem like you\u2019re being picky due to your insecurities, which isn\u2019t fair for the rest of the bridal party to deal with. Bridesmaids dresses are often not the most flattering dresses anyway, tbh.\n\nHowever, the bride is definitely wrong because she snapped at you in public in front of what I imagine was the whole bridal party.

OP sounds frankly like she was being pretty tiresome here if they were shopping for one dress for so long.\n\nI'll also add that honestly, I would have thought it pretty obvious the bride wouldn't really want a stranger to her in her bridal party.

OP didn't just gain all the wisdom of life on her birthday, she's an adult sure but she's a fresh one with body issues, shopping for clothes on a normal day is probably taxing enough.\n\nYeah that amount of indecisiveness can get irritating, I've had some nightmare shopping trips before, but they literally could have just gone home for the day.

Which is not the same experience as shopping at an actual bridal store where they have clips, tell you about alteration options, and can add sleeves or a matching wrap. I have also been in a wedding where it was here's a picture of the dress, send measurements, they have to be the same dye batch.", "Took me a minute to scroll to a comment this rational. Neither party was in the right.   \nOP seems like they were being difficult and maybe not realizing some of the nuances of the situation (the day isn't about them, they should be more mindful of the rest of the shopping party's stime, etc.), Bride was still out of line for yelling. \n\nPersonally I wonder how true to story this retelling is, I would find it surprising that the bride went straight to yelling and swearing in public, I wonder if that's exaggerated (intentionally or not) due to OP's insecurity about the situation or if there was more build-up that she was perhaps oblivious too.", "On his next wedding \ud83e\udd23", "Thank you for this. You join the party knowing that the day belongs to the bride, compromises and concessions must be made to what the bride wants. That includes those in 'uniform' accepting they may not look as they would normally like too.\n\nFor me, this is part of the convention. Poster is young but needs to learn to put her ego and self second in situations requiring a polity.\n\nI am taking her word that she did not understand why the bride lost her temper. But I see this refusal to acknowledge or concede one's own behaviours and part in a scene commonly amongst aware people who know but refuse to drop the power and control.\n\nThere is still a society of conventions in which we live. Play ball to be a part or don't be a part. Or don't but understand you will be regarded as selfish or narcissistic or aggressively naive.", "I just thought OP wanted to be a part of the wedding. Like she didn't think she was close enough to the bride to be chosen as a bridesmaid so flower girl was a compromise", "And OP isn't the one throwing a tantrum over being out at the shops for too long like a toddler in need of a nap.", "I agree w u.", "But flower girls are almost always children, usually 5 or younger. That \u201cflower girl\u201d was the first thought of an 18 year old is telling, IMO.", "The adults should have stepped in and said as much.", "Op does, but so does the bride to an extent. The feeling was valid, the action taken was not though. That\u2019s why I went a more everyone sucks judgement. There were plenty of ways to avoid this mess.", "18 is also an age where most people would recognize its inappropriate to make someone else's event all about them. She needed to stop trying on and discarding dresses and do that on her own time.", "To be fair, the last wedding I went to had a 27 year old dude as the \u201cflower girl\u201d. So while it\u2019s definitely traditional for it to be a younger girl it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule/requirement unless the bride/groom desire it to be.", "We dealt with a MOH at my wife's wedding who was beyond fussy and also had body issues. It made the dress shopping part super stressful for her. We're talking weeks of dithering. The rest of the bridesmaids knew their role. Also, we paid for those dresses.\n\nHaving experienced this, I'm fully onboard with the whole 'pick now or we pick for you and you can suck it up' ethos.", "on both ends. I don't know how pushy OP was about being a bridesmaid but it doesn't sound like she was but on the other hand, the bride should have said no from the start if she didn't want her there", "The bride and groom putting each others siblings in the wedding party is extremely common", "It's her brother's wedding lol. It's so weird to me that people think only the bride gets married. If course she wanted to be in her sibling's wedding. If she was gonna be an ass to an 18 year old she could have just given the instructions on what dress requirements were and then the teenager could have gone, going one she liked and sent her a picture of confirmation. \n\nThey're literally mad at her because they never wanted her in the wedding.", "And do they all have to go every time? I mean, picture messages exist", "It makes it feel like it's written by an adult man and it's weird", "Mental illness and can\u2019t accept she\u2019s an adult. Probably why she has issues with her self image. Calling yourself freshly 18 screams of trying to hold onto child hood.", "The dresses didn\u2019t fit, what was the OP doing wrong?", "But like, it is her oldest brother\u2019s wedding. I feel like it\u2019s perfectly normal for her to want to be in the wedding party?", "Camera phones make it really easy to try dresses on without an entourage and check in with the bride before purchase. Bride sucks, if she\u2019s so hard pressed going to three shops she could be the older adult and say \u201cyou\u2019ll find the right one eventually, we\u2019ve been out on the town for a while, would you be up for checking more out over the next days/weeks and sending me a picture to double check that it works with the rest of the party when you find one you like?\u201d Crazy how easy it is to not be an asshole.", "I'm sure there is stuff being let out that matters.\n\nI've had my share of fights where I was 100% the asshole in hindsight after hearing what other people were going through, even if I believed me behavior to be fine. My tone may convey something the wrong way, I say something that is a trigger for another person without knowing, someone was already having a bad day and a small comment I said (regardless of intent) Set them off. These things happen. It is very rarely ever an unjustified emotional outburst.", "Because the bride wanted her bridesmaid to have matching outfits? Or validate them? If it's the case it's on her for wanting to police what people wear at this extent.", "She wanted to be in the wedding so should of thought of her body image issues before accepting. No one forced her to be bridesmaid. I don't think your taking in how stressful it is on the bride planning a wedding and trying to keep everyone happy, from who's invited, who's in wedding party, the cost of the whole thing.....the girl had to find a dress, the bride has soooo much more to deal with.", "And verification could have just as easily been done with a text photo. The bride gave the guideline of \u201cas long as it\u2019s red\u201d and left it at that. OP could have still gone and done the other things and just not picked a dress that day when everyone else was ready to leave.", "The amount of people absolutely roasting OP is insane. Some people are assuming vile things about her for no freaking reason. I agree with you.", "It\u2019s crazy what some couples come up with for their wedding.", "I like it. It\u2019s so much fun to see couples modifying their ceremonies in ways that are significant and meaningful to them.\n\nI\u2019d totally let my grandma be a flower girl haha", "We did the same! Both of them had fanny packs full of rose petals and we had a fun/upbeat song playing for them! Everyone was laughing and having a good time!", "This right here! How many dresses did they offer just for OP to say:\n\n- I\u2019d look fat in that\n- I don\u2019t do that neckline \n- I like this neckline but the skirt has to reach my ankles \n- I like the length of this dress but the colour is the wrong red \n- Etc \n\nThey went to three stores and only put on five dresses because OP said no to every other float dress that could come in red in all the other stores.", "Oh dear lord. \n\nYou pushed your way into the wedding and then made the bride go to THREE different stores and watch you try on innumerable dresses? That sounds like absolute hell and no one has the time or patience for that. \n\nI completely understand why she snapped.\n\nYour body issues are your problem. \n\nBridesmaid dresses are supposed to be hideous. She should have been able to give you a color, a small handful of options, and left you to it. You should have picked what was least awful and then just dealt with it.\n\nThis is multi store thing is ridiculous and you were making the wedding all about you and insanely stressful. \n\nYou were essentially holding her hostage because her choices were entertain this nonsense or risk the extreme consequences of booting her SIL from the wedding party.\n\nSlight YTA, leaning E S H because snapping is never a good look.\n\nGo apologize to the bride. Say you fucked up and should have realized that your dress issues weren't a good fit for being a bride's maid and you got so fixated you didn't realize things had spiralled into ridiculous before you wound up there. Offer to be an usher or something you are comfortable with and which will not require her to handhold you through it.\n\nThen smooth things over with your mom, or your brother will never forgive you, either, if you end up being the reason why his bride is rejected by her MIL.", "Having been through 3 of my siblings weddings the bridesmaids are supposed to have dresses of the same make and model so to speak so they look uniform, the colors aren\u2019t off slight etc. \n\nOP said no and the bride didn\u2019t mind at first cause she wasn\u2019t set on a style or color yet. Let her look at her second favorite dress idea and OP said no. At this point dress 3-5 the bride had as a back up but didn\u2019t like them and OP went through all of them saying no and then tried free styling her own dress. At that point the bride cracked. \n\nWhat OP is doing is quite tacky.", "The dresses didn\u2019t fit. Why do people keep missing this shit?", "I don't think three (or five, even) is a lot of shops to go to. A lot of bridal boutiques are small and only have a limited number of dresses in stock.", "Sisters of the groom are expected to be part of the wedding party because they are about to become part of the bride's family now as well. If the bride doesn't respect or even hates the groom's sisters, then it's a huge red flag and the groom should reconsider marrying her.", "Y'all have some weird families. You are acting like she's a cousin or something. Why wouldn't a sibling want to be included in another sibling's wedding. She didn't even ask to be the bridesmaid, she asked to be the flower girl. A low stakes roll that would allow her to participate in the wedding. I assume op's mom is why she is the bridesmaid. And quite frankly, considering the age difference between op and everyone else involved. They should have said something at the first shop, when op struggled to find something. The bride's inability to speak up is not op's fault. Should op have been more aware that she was being difficult? Yea, she should have. But some people are wildly aloof when it comes to social cues. There's still several other adults, plus her mother, who should have said something. Instead, they all, seemingly, stayed quiet. Bottling up anger and frustrating like children...               \n\n\nI would not let anyone talk to my siblings that way. Regardless of what the situation was. Marriages are about families coming together and becoming one. This wasn't an example of it.", "I agree, I think that she\u2019s making it way too stressful. At some point you  try on a dress, it ok, realize you\u2019re gonna wear it for one day and then you shut up about it and move on. YTA", "The 18 year old flower girl request was the first thing I noticed. Something is definitely going on there. OP is the only girl and the youngest in her family. I don\u2019t think her family tells her no much.", "Nope. Melting down and screaming and cussing at someone because it's taking a while to pick a dress is a choice by the bride. Also struggling to find the right dress isn't going to ruin the wedding. The only person who contributed to the meltdown outside of the immature bride was the bride's mother", "Would guess more on the fact that a blind person could read the room better then she could and that she just didnt notice anybody getting annoyed or pushing her to just fucking pick a dress and not be picky. \n\nAnd now im just thinking like either a supermodel humble bragging about how the dress looks bad on her or a realy fat 150kg girl looking for a dress in size small for like a 50 kg girl.", "\"yes, but kim, you and i aren't friends\" followed by kim's drunk bridal party kicking her out is stuck in my mind forever", "This is likely why brides assign bridesmaid dresses,  this dress, did your size, minor alterations MAYBE, and we're done.  \nAll the bridesmaids were given a lot of latitude, evidently too much.", "I'm definitely sure that is a part of it.  Like fucking hell they are on the fifth dress at the third store for a girl the bride only has in her wedding party as a curtesy.\n\nLike pick something or go on your own time if you are going to be so difficult.\n\nI'm also sure that there was other plans for the day that are being held up by OP's insane standards for off the rack dresses.\n\nThe only reason I don't feel like op is fat.  Is I feel like a fat person just says that.\n\n>I by nature have body image problems so finding a dress to compliment by body \n\nLike that doesn't sound like a fat person.  That sounds like an 18 year old insecure about their normal person body because they don't look like a pin up doll.", "Gotta ask, I don't see the post saying they pushed for her to be a bm? I see that she asked to be a flower girl and they said no, but you can be a bm instead?", "Where do you get that they pushed to make her a BM?\n\nShe literally says she would have been happy just being a flower girl.", "I paid for my bridesmaids' dresses. Except for one who insisted on paying (I'd been in her wedding and her dresses were pretty expensive and came with \"but you'll totally be able to wear them socially\"....I'm sure we both know how many times post wedding I wore that dress.", "Right but in a world where 25 year olds are made to feel fat for no longer having the body of an 18 year old, plus all the stress of being a bride, I don't really blame the bride either. Seriously, it's her wedding, how did it become about OP's body image issues? Why is OP getting to choose a dress anyway, she should just be wearing what the bride picks, no matter how unflatteringly it is. That's what being a bridesmaid is. \n\nI'm too old to care now, but at 25, my eyes would have rolled all the way to the back of my head.", "It\u2019s reddit, if you\u2019re under 30 you\u2019re a \u201cliteral child\u201d and if you are a male partner older than your female partner in any capacity, you\u2019re a cradle snatching creep!", "It was three shops and five dresses is not that much.. it's certainly not some exaggerated amount that would justify the bride flying off the handle. They could've also suggested her finding a dress on her own time instead.", "Are you kidding?? I've been a bridesmaid multiple times, and a bride. I tried on sooooo many dresses. So many. At multiple stores! And I was heavily pregnant one of those weddings trying to find something that would look good on a post-partum body. \n\nThis was just the 5th dress. For (bleeps) sake, so what if she didn't find any that specific day? At my SILs wedding we had 3 different dress shopping days where all we did was go try on dresses, take pictures of them all, and then go get food and look at the photos and talk about them and discuss pros and cons. We did this 3 times! In part because we were all chill about it and we were having fun! We all had wildly different body shapes, and the bride wanted us to find something that fit us all. \n\nIf the bride had a better attitude and was just chill about this (because this should have been a light-hearted and fun thing), there would have been no issue. 5 outfit changes. I go through as much trying to find the perfect pair of jeans. \n\nThe *real* issue is the bride never wanted OP to be involved in the first place, and so she lost her temper with her easily.", "NTA  OP is 18 years old and has never been a bridesmaid. If the bridal party were setting up appointments at more than one shop and allowing them to go through multiple dresses how was she supposed to know if the bride just wanted it to be over with?  It sounds like the bride (said she) wanted everyone to pick whatever flowy thing they liked and get it in red.  If she was just being nice and the real expectation is she basically just wants everyone to get something that physically covers their body adequately and keep it moving that should be explained.  Especially to a teenager who wouldn\u2019t be aware of whatever context around wedding dress shopping the bride may be expecting her to have.", "Exactly, and OP isn\u2019t going to tell us just how pushy they were, but if I had to guess it was pretty pushy. Most freshly 18 year olds are (was pretty recently a said pushy 18 year old girl myself, though it\u2019s been a couple years) especially if it\u2019s something they\u2019re excited about. Most of us ladies dream of the days we get to participate in friends and families weddings. So I\u2019d be willing to bet it was at least pushier than normal circumstances. But I\u2019m also curious about OPs general upbringing, being the only girl AND the youngest, with the older 2 being much older? I guarantee that this is probably a good ol case of \u201cgolden child\u201d syndrome and the REAL assholes here were OP\u2019s parents.", "I assuming OP is in the U.S. If that's the case, the bride is 25. Her two chosen bridesmaids were probably friends her age. So she got saddled with a bridesmaid she didn't want who is underage. What did that do to plans for a bachelorette party?", "This line from OP:\n\n \"I just wanted to be the flower girl but they said I was too old\u2026 so instead the wife said you could be a bridesmaid.\"\n\nSays to me OP was being pushy. Possibly pushier than they realized given their age and excitement. \n\nIt's also possible OP misunderstood the assignment and the bridesmaids were to find a matching dress they all liked, and OP was the one refusing every dress. Which, adults should have intervened. But I think there's a lot going on here we are missing, either intentionally left out or OP is just not worldly enough to understand it's important.", "yeah I feel like OP's mom was probably pushy about it, too. also, I have never dreamed of being in a wedding, even my own because of self esteem/body issues, so I might not be in the best place to say anything about anyone's desire to be in a wedding (yes, I am a girl)"]}
