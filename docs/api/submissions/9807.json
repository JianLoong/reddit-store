He does have autism, but it's not like he can't function. He walks to every class on his own without needing help and is capable of doing things himself. But he's not a nice kid at all. He takes pictures of people without consent. He comes to my table at lunch, starts mocking my friends and I, and won't leave. He also said some really racist and sexist things. He's always coming up to me and bragging about stupid things, like how he's taller than me.

We're in most of our classes together, and he insists on sitting near me in all of them. He also tells on me for everything I do. If I have my phone out he'll tell the teacher. Which, okay, I shouldn't have my phone out, but it's not his business. \n\nA few days ago, I was walking with my friend through the hallway, and I caught him taking pictures of me or taking a video or something.

But my friend got defensive and told him to leave us alone, and they started arguing. Eventually I just lost patience and snapped at the kid and told him to fuck off. One of the teachers came over and asked what was happening, and she brought all of us to the principal, and the kid said that my friend and I were \"ganging up on him.\" My friend interrupted him and told the principal about what the boy was doing. The boy apologized to us and explained that he's autistic and sometimes doesn't know what's not acceptable to do. The principal seemed like he believed him, and when he was about to let him go, I cut in and said that just because he has autism doesn't mean he's not an asshole, and everyone needed to realize that. After that, the school called my parents. When I got home my dad was really mad at me for disrespecting the kid. My mom understood but my dad wanted to take my phone away.

People with autism do not pick up on social cues like the rest of us do HOWEVER that doesn't mean that they can continue their behavior when they are either asked or told to stop.  They need to actually learn that no means no regardless of their disability and this kid seems like he's on the high functioning side so there's really no reason he can't learn other than no one is holding him accountable to his actions and in the real world his behaviors are considered harassment and he would find himself in legal trouble regardless of his autism.  NTA but I'd continue to report his behaviors and keep a record to report them to the school and higher up so you can get some peace.  Everyone has the right to be left TF alone.", "NTA, but I\u2019d ask for a record to be made every time you\u2019ve had to complain to a teacher about things.  That way you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re picking on them.

Using your disability as an excuse to be a shitty person is never okay.", "NTA. He won\u2019t learn what is and isn\u2019t acceptable if he is never reprimanded for his behavior.

No one in the outside world is going to care if he is autistic.\n\nHis parents and your school are failing him.", "NTA unfortunately we humans always have to be on extreme side from extreme hate for the disabled for putting them on pedestal and they can't do wrong", "NTA\n\nI also have autism, and yeah, this guy is just an asshole. I think the reaction you got is because the conversation was about just the picture thing. Like, what he says about not knowing what's okay to do is just 100% true, that's what autism is. If he stops after being told its not okay then it was probably legitimate, and just not something you could call him an asshole over. However if he doesn't stop after this then it was just an excuse and if he keeps up the act he's bullshitting people.\n\nI feel like if you have a conversation with your dad and tell him about everything that you posted here then he'll understand you better.\n\nEven if all of his behaviour is just him being socially inept, which is genuinely possible, that doesn't mean he isn't being an asshole. He might not intend it that way, but it's horrible behaviour and you should never be forced to deal with that just because they have a disability.\n\nThe best advise I can give you is to:\n1. Don't let it get to you. No matter what others say this behaviour of his is not okay.\n2. Be direct with him. Remain calm and tell him when things are not okay to do or say. And tell him when he does something you don't like, and ask him not to do it again.\n\nIf he's a decent person then he'll try to listen to you, and won't bother you as much anymore. And as I said I have autism myself, I'm a few years older so I have plenty of experience. Trust me that if you're direct with him and he doesn't listen, then his autism isn't an excuse.", "NTA. I have son with Autism. In many cases it takes someone telling him that he is being an asshole before he gets it. It takes patience because to change behavior in someone with autism you have to convince them they are being an asshole while at the same time explaining what acceptable behavior is and you have to be specific and suggest canned responses that they may choose to employ in the future.  To learn to act normally in social situations my son had to memorize how to act and what to say. He would then choose to use repeatedly whichever ones worked best.  Sometimes you have to live them in spite of themselves. It\u2019s not easy but you will grow as a person just by the effort. Your feeling upset by this kid\u2019s behavior and your assertion that he is being an awhile are absolutely valid and understandable. Try to use the situation to grow personally and also to help him to grow by learning what is a good behavior and what is not. Do not beat yourself up needlessly.", "NTA.

That's literally what they say. They're also super smart and calculating. They know exactly what they're doing and what the outcome will be from their actions but there's no consequences because insert BS excuse here. \n\nHalf of the family have completely cut this person out of their lives because we have no time for their BS and they don't like the fact that we don't bend over backwards to their every whim and want. \n\nIt's actually really sad because when this person grows up, they won't have any real friends, family won't want anything to do with them and others won't give their BS the time of day. \n\nThankfully, you'll only be around this person for a couple more years, then you never need to see them again. I wouldn't stop calling them on their behaviour though.", "NTA. That kid needs an ass beatin.

You\u2019re right that his behavior is problematic and shouldn\u2019t be excused, and a teacher or counselor should absolutely address it \u2014 but calling him an asshole was unnecessary and bordering on cruel. \n\nTl;dr have boundaries but don\u2019t resort to cruelty to get your point across, especially to someone with a disability", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Im saying the second the older boy (hs boarded last) got on the bus, kid would whip around in his seat and start going at it. It got to the point all of us had to intervene, told the bus driver, bus driver wouldn\u2019t continue the route until kids moon picked him up, next day at school principal tried to suspend the older boy because he should have \u201cjust ignored him, because he\u2019s just a kid with autism.\u201d Kid was being homophobic, racist, fat phobic, and throwing stuff at him.  It took the older kids going into his office and telling what actually happened before the principal did anything, kid had to sit right behind the bus driver from that point i on and would be kicked off the bus if he said a word to the older boy.\n\nThe older boy never did anything to the kid, it was like the kid decided one day he was gonna fuck with the older guy. \n\n\nKid weaponized his disability, and the adults allowed him to do it without consequences.

Tell them if this really is the case, he needs more help / a shadow. Otherwise tell them you won't accept feeling harassed in school by a male any longer. Tell them you will get police involved for harassment. Or maybe you can ask the local newspaper to bring an article that school isn't able to protect female students against sexual harassment if autism is involved (without going into detail about the boy like age, class and so on).

People who have autism may have a hard time with social cues and need specific direction- However,  it doesn't mean that they don't know the difference between right and wrong. For him to say that he doesn't know the difference,  means he's heard somebody else say that before, and he knows he can get away with it. It's a manipulation tactic. \n\nHe needs to be called out.

I\u2019m just saying make people feel isolated and alone even more, dont be surprised when it goes wrong. Ive been on that side and I cant ever forgive society.
