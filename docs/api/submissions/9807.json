He does have autism, but it's not like he can't function. He walks to every class on his own without needing help and is capable of doing things himself. But he's not a nice kid at all. He takes pictures of people without consent. He comes to my table at lunch, starts mocking my friends and I, and won't leave. He also said some really racist and sexist things. He's always coming up to me and bragging about stupid things, like how he's taller than me. (I'm 5'3 and he's 5'8, and he's seriously saying that because he's taller he's more attractive.) \n\nFor some weird reason, he also seems very attached to me. We're in most of our classes together, and he insists on sitting near me in all of them. He also tells on me for everything I do. If I have my phone out he'll tell the teacher. Which, okay, I shouldn't have my phone out, but it's not his business. \n\nA few days ago, I was walking with my friend through the hallway, and I caught him taking pictures of me or taking a video or something. (I know because he was walking farther behind us and holding his phone out) At first I wasn't going to say anything since, because of his disability, I would be the one getting in trouble if I did something. But my friend got defensive and told him to leave us alone, and they started arguing. Eventually I just lost patience and snapped at the kid and told him to fuck off. One of the teachers came over and asked what was happening, and she brought all of us to the principal, and the kid said that my friend and I were \"ganging up on him.\" My friend interrupted him and told the principal about what the boy was doing. The boy apologized to us and explained that he's autistic and sometimes doesn't know what's not acceptable to do. The principal seemed like he believed him, and when he was about to let him go, I cut in and said that just because he has autism doesn't mean he's not an asshole, and everyone needed to realize that. After that, the school called my parents. When I got home my dad was really mad at me for disrespecting the kid. My mom understood but my dad wanted to take my phone away.

People with autism do not pick up on social cues like the rest of us do HOWEVER that doesn't mean that they can continue their behavior when they are either asked or told to stop.  They need to actually learn that no means no regardless of their disability and this kid seems like he's on the high functioning side so there's really no reason he can't learn other than no one is holding him accountable to his actions and in the real world his behaviors are considered harassment and he would find himself in legal trouble regardless of his autism.  NTA but I'd continue to report his behaviors and keep a record to report them to the school and higher up so you can get some peace.  Everyone has the right to be left TF alone.", "NTA, but I\u2019d ask for a record to be made every time you\u2019ve had to complain to a teacher about things.  That way you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re picking on them.  They may or may not be able to help it, but at least you can show that you have gone to those in charge multiple times.", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of the episode from the big bang theory when Penny says, Raj\u2019s girlfriend can\u2019t be a gold digger, she is deaf, deaf people are nice. \n\nThe kid knew exactly what he was doing. He did it multiple times before. Just because you are autistic doesn\u2019t mean you get a free pass at everything.

Using your disability as an excuse to be a shitty person is never okay.", "NTA. He won\u2019t learn what is and isn\u2019t acceptable if he is never reprimanded for his behavior. Being disabled, mentally ill, etc is not a free pass to treat others poorly.

No one in the outside world is going to care if he is autistic.\n\nHis parents and your school are failing him.", "NTA unfortunately we humans always have to be on extreme side from extreme hate for the disabled for putting them on pedestal and they can't do wrong", "NTA\n\nI also have autism, and yeah, this guy is just an asshole. I think the reaction you got is because the conversation was about just the picture thing. Like, what he says about not knowing what's okay to do is just 100% true, that's what autism is. If he stops after being told its not okay then it was probably legitimate, and just not something you could call him an asshole over. However if he doesn't stop after this then it was just an excuse and if he keeps up the act he's bullshitting people.\n\nI feel like if you have a conversation with your dad and tell him about everything that you posted here then he'll understand you better.\n\nEven if all of his behaviour is just him being socially inept, which is genuinely possible, that doesn't mean he isn't being an asshole. He might not intend it that way, but it's horrible behaviour and you should never be forced to deal with that just because they have a disability.\n\nThe best advise I can give you is to:\n1. Don't let it get to you. No matter what others say this behaviour of his is not okay.\n2. Be direct with him. Remain calm and tell him when things are not okay to do or say. And tell him when he does something you don't like, and ask him not to do it again.\n\nIf he's a decent person then he'll try to listen to you, and won't bother you as much anymore. And as I said I have autism myself, I'm a few years older so I have plenty of experience. Trust me that if you're direct with him and he doesn't listen, then his autism isn't an excuse.", "NTA. I have son with Autism. In many cases it takes someone telling him that he is being an asshole before he gets it. It takes patience because to change behavior in someone with autism you have to convince them they are being an asshole while at the same time explaining what acceptable behavior is and you have to be specific and suggest canned responses that they may choose to employ in the future.  To learn to act normally in social situations my son had to memorize how to act and what to say. He would then choose to use repeatedly whichever ones worked best.  Sometimes you have to live them in spite of themselves. It\u2019s not easy but you will grow as a person just by the effort. Your feeling upset by this kid\u2019s behavior and your assertion that he is being an awhile are absolutely valid and understandable. Try to use the situation to grow personally and also to help him to grow by learning what is a good behavior and what is not. Do not beat yourself up needlessly.", "NTA.

That's literally what they say. They're also super smart and calculating. They know exactly what they're doing and what the outcome will be from their actions but there's no consequences because insert BS excuse here. \n\nHalf of the family have completely cut this person out of their lives because we have no time for their BS and they don't like the fact that we don't bend over backwards to their every whim and want. \n\nIt's actually really sad because when this person grows up, they won't have any real friends, family won't want anything to do with them and others won't give their BS the time of day. \n\nThankfully, you'll only be around this person for a couple more years, then you never need to see them again. I wouldn't stop calling them on their behaviour though.", "NTA. That kid needs an ass beatin. If he\u2019s savvy enough to try and pull a \u201cpoor me\u201d act before getting called out only to then apologize and claim his autism is to blame, he\u2019s savvy enough to throw down.

You\u2019re right that his behavior is problematic and shouldn\u2019t be excused, and a teacher or counselor should absolutely address it \u2014 but calling him an asshole was unnecessary and bordering on cruel. \n\nTl;dr have boundaries but don\u2019t resort to cruelty to get your point across, especially to someone with a disability", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The boys autism IS absolutely an explanation for his behaviour. Autism wouldn't exist if we could just switch it off and do better. An autistic person doing something antisocial doesn't make things harder for me as an autistic person either as anyone who understands the condition knows that it's a spectrum.

OP clearly feels their boundaries are being violated and they are not being supported and that is not okay. The teachers should be much more on this if the Autistic boy has tendencies to upset other people or act in antisocial ways.

I'm autistic & I have qualifications in & work with autism. It's incorrect to not accept that there are both positive and negative traits that can come with being on the spectrum.

He was being an asshole and knows it.\n\nI have NVLD (I'm a woman) and can't read body language due to that part of my brain not developing properly.  Even I know you shouldn't randomly film people without asking.\n\ntagging u/Desperate-Bat-8702 because your school has taught the boy that you are having issues with, *the exact same thing.*", "YTA I understand you are only 16 but, you should understand the difficulty an autistic person has navigating through this world. I'm glad at least one of your parents has a clue.", "I'm baffled by the idea that OP attends a school where disabled kids harrassing neurotypical or abled kids is common enough to be noteworthy?? Disabled and neurodivergent people can absolutely be shitty but I've never heard of an environment where \"all the disabled kids are bullying the innocent ableds\" is a significant problem.\n\nObviously NTA, but where the hell is OP living?", "Jumping on the top comment to say I am the teacher in this situation! I work at an alternative school and an autistic boy is harassing one of my female students by constantly asking her out and refusing to take no for an answer. I and the other female staff think it is ridiculous that he can stalk on social media/ in hallway and have no consequences because he's autistic. The (male) principal and counselor say everything is due to autism and side with the boy. I see the principal's point, but as a female just NO. You can be autistic AND an AH. I see it every day at work. Good luck op!", "NTA.  You\u2019re not wrong.  \n\nAutism doesn\u2019t come with AH immunity.\n\nPeople with or without autism can be AHs.", "Exactly!\n\nMy fiancee is on the spectrum and sometimes says or does the wrong thing but he ALWAYS apologises and does his best to correct himself to avoid hurting anyone going forward. \n\nBecause he\u2019s a decent fucking person and he understands that even if he has no ill intent and didn\u2019t understand his words have power and he needs to hold himself accountable. \n\nNeurodivergence and mental health is not a carte blanche to be an asshole. It can be a reason to explain behaviour but provided you have the brain function of a 7 year old they should understand that actions have consequences and right from wrong, good from bad, and have a modicum of self control.", "When I was 17-18, there was an autistic boy in my program who had a crush on one of my friends (girl) and he followed her everywhere. (I personally learnt he was autistic a bit later.) She was not confortable with confrontation and she'd just try avoiding his questions, which in hindsight was the worst strategy, but we didn't know it at the time. He kept pestering her for almost 2 years. We told her she should tell him plainly she wasn't interested, but she didn't want to. We offered to say for her and she said no. It ended with her feeling so cornered that she took her juice box and sprayed him with the juice. She was very proud of standing up for herself and our friend group was torn. I was of the mind that it was not an appropriate way to say no for the 1st time. \n\nSorry for the tangent, but yeah, in all those cases (not the story I was telling, my friend should have just said she wasn't interested) there should be a point where the principal or a counselor sits down with the student, says A B and C are inappropriate, writes it down and if it happens again, the student gets consequences.", "Yeah both my siblings. (Brother and sister, both younger) and my father has autism, I can\u2019t really make any comment \nabout my dad I don\u2019t know enough, but for both my siblings I can, my brother is fine he is more towards anger and freak outs when things change, my sister fits more so in with this thread, she was practically raised by my grandparents (my grandparents and both of my mothers siblings familys so that\u2019s 3 houses, all homophobic and racist and all that crap, my parents arnt there\u2019s some cousins that are some that arnt) my sister isn\u2019t homophobic or racist or sexist, however is extremely spoiled, she will want stuff and complaines when she does get it, and then there\u2019s stuff that is clearly because of her autism, dispising me ( she gets mad if I hug my parents or dog before her when going to bed or if I\u2019m in the same room with here, this on is 50/50 she\u2019s sometimes nice,) she\u2019s rude to some girl as school who\u2019s \u201cwierd\u201d and has a wierd haircut (a bob cut, which I personally don\u2019t think looks that bad) ( I want to note while my brother was anger and planning and stuff, my sister was anger and silent she didn\u2019t speak to anyone not family till like half way through primary school) I understand why it\u2019s happening both being spoiled and the autism I also pointed out to my mother that not punishing her when she starts screaming cause I forgot to let her hug our mother first or something similar won\u2019t teach her anything , but I also reconize she can\u2019t punish my brother (in this example, there are moments he definitely would need to be punished, I\u2019m using him here as I have a example I don\u2019t know to much about my sister) when he pushes or attacks a teacher/ or rips/destroys his bag or something of similar vein because the teacher that was supposed to walk him around school and let him out before the other kids started crowding (both siblings hate crowds and therefore leave and enter school and classrooms early ) and left him on his own while in the wrong yes, we tell him it\u2019s wrong to go about it in the way he did (we as in my parents) and put counter measures in place, tell the school, make sure he has a safe space, fiddle toys and stuff like that", "Do you think he should be shadowed?", "OP\u2019s boundaries ARE being violated.  People are allowed to decide not to consent to interactions with specific people in social situations, full stop.  If this student is having chronic issues with understanding consent, there\u2019s clearly a larger issue with whether he\u2019s getting appropriate assistance from the school, his teachers and aides, his parents, therapists, etc\u2026", "Because the adults in his life have taught him that if he cries \"autism!\" then he won't face consequences. He's never HAD to learn to do better. Autistic people are absolutely capable of learning social norms when they've accidentally violated them (Source: am autistic). Unfortunately, it seems that every adult in this boy's life has abdicated that responsibility. He's still a kid, and a disabled one at that. The real blame should be on the adults around him who are consistently failing him. I'm sorry OP is dealing with the result of that failure, and I'm sorry for everyone else that kid is going to encounter in life...", "I feel unfortunately like you're going to get downvoted because people on this sub don't care to listen to actual lived experience but I really appreciate your response to my comment and your examples of your own personal experience of the challenging behaviours associated with some forms of autism. Thank you for commenting.", "Correct me if I am wrong, but it's also possible for an autistic person to be racist or sexist, right? Yes, there is a possibility he's mimicking, but it could also be that he holds those views.", "I could care less about downvotes, but yeah it\u2019s like 1 in the morning and I\u2019m dead tired to half of what I said probably doesn\u2019t make sense, but I appreciate the appreciation, special needs do need extra attention, but there still kids and should be told right and wrong by authority figures is the take away,\n\nEdit: I spell checked my earlier comment should be easier to read\n\nEdit2: I want to add some notes, I don\u2019t know much about autism itself I mean I know the basics but i don\u2019t know specifics or the types and all that crap, so while I know it can vary heavily, I don\u2019t know to what extent, and therefore don\u2019t know why the kid in the original post could be doing what he is whether, whether the school is just handling special needs terribly and that\u2019s partly the cause, or if he\u2019s just and asshole, or that theres a reason caused by autism that causes him to act the way he does, I have no idea so this isn\u2019t me giving my opinion on the original post but telling my own experiences", "All children mimick the actions of the adults in their lives. This person claiming they're doing it because of their autism is just flat out wrong.\n\nThis kid is 16. They know what racism and sexism is, they know what they're saying is racist and sexist. If they *don't* know this, they are a high needs individual who shouldn't be left alone, especially around other children."]}
