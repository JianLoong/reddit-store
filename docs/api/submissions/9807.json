The staff members are all nice and everything, but one thing I noticed is that they definitely have a bias towards students with disabilities like autism. I know sometimes it's necessary to give certain kids extra help and stuff, but there's kids in my school that have been harassing my friends and I all year, and they never get in trouble because of their autism. \n\nThere's a lot of them, but there's one boy that's really been a problem for a long time. He does have autism, but it's not like he can't function. He walks to every class on his own without needing help and is capable of doing things himself. But he's not a nice kid at all. He takes pictures of people without consent. He comes to my table at lunch, starts mocking my friends and I, and won't leave. He also said some really racist and sexist things. He's always coming up to me and bragging about stupid things, like how he's taller than me. (I'm 5'3 and he's 5'8, and he's seriously saying that because he's taller he's more attractive.) \n\nFor some weird reason, he also seems very attached to me. We're in most of our classes together, and he insists on sitting near me in all of them. He also tells on me for everything I do. If I have my phone out he'll tell the teacher. Which, okay, I shouldn't have my phone out, but it's not his business. \n\nA few days ago, I was walking with my friend through the hallway, and I caught him taking pictures of me or taking a video or something. (I know because he was walking farther behind us and holding his phone out) At first I wasn't going to say anything since, because of his disability, I would be the one getting in trouble if I did something. But my friend got defensive and told him to leave us alone, and they started arguing. Eventually I just lost patience and snapped at the kid and told him to fuck off. One of the teachers came over and asked what was happening, and she brought all of us to the principal, and the kid said that my friend and I were \"ganging up on him.\" My friend interrupted him and told the principal about what the boy was doing. The boy apologized to us and explained that he's autistic and sometimes doesn't know what's not acceptable to do. The principal seemed like he believed him, and when he was about to let him go, I cut in and said that just because he has autism doesn't mean he's not an asshole, and everyone needed to realize that. After that, the school called my parents. When I got home my dad was really mad at me for disrespecting the kid. My mom understood but my dad wanted to take my phone away.

That boy\u2019s autism is not an excuse for him to irritate others and do stuff like taking pics/videos of others without their consent. He is making it difficult for other autistic individuals who genuinely have trouble in social situations. NTA", "NTA, but you need to start working with your parents and the school to address these issues. If he's saying racist, sexist things, the teachers need to be informed. If he's harassing you at lunch, the staff need to be informed. If they don't do anything talk to your mom. \n\nHe's being taught it is ok to use his autism as an excuse to harass people. \n\nYou're 100% correct that autism doesn't mean people are assholes. Being autistic doesn't make you racist or cause you to harass people.", "NTA. It\u2019s true, and it looks like he\u2019s been using that excuse for a long time. While his autism definitely does impact his decision making, he also needs to learn right and wrong. He\u2019s not the first kid to weaponize his disability, and he won\u2019t be the last, especially when administrators keep reinforcing this", "NTA at all.\n\nHis shitty behavior is a problem he\u2018s responsible for and can fix. His autism isn\u2018t an excuse or justification for being a racist, sexist bully.", "NTA; you deserve your privacy from someone taking videos of you for unknown usage. Just because someone has autism doesn't mean they are free from consequences of their actions.", "You were completely correct in your assessment in that just because you have autism that doesn't mean you can't be an asshole.  People with autism do not pick up on social cues like the rest of us do HOWEVER that doesn't mean that they can continue their behavior when they are either asked or told to stop.  They need to actually learn that no means no regardless of their disability and this kid seems like he's on the high functioning side so there's really no reason he can't learn other than no one is holding him accountable to his actions and in the real world his behaviors are considered harassment and he would find himself in legal trouble regardless of his autism.  NTA but I'd continue to report his behaviors and keep a record to report them to the school and higher up so you can get some peace.  Everyone has the right to be left TF alone.", "NTA, but I\u2019d ask for a record to be made every time you\u2019ve had to complain to a teacher about things.  That way you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re picking on them.  They may or may not be able to help it, but at least you can show that you have gone to those in charge multiple times.", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of the episode from the big bang theory when Penny says, Raj\u2019s girlfriend can\u2019t be a gold digger, she is deaf, deaf people are nice. \n\nThe kid knew exactly what he was doing. He did it multiple times before. Just because you are autistic doesn\u2019t mean you get a free pass at everything. When he leaves highschool, he is in for a rude awakening.", "NTA his autism isn't an excuse for him to bully others.", "NTA you are completely right. Autism doesn\u2019t give you the right to act like an asshole. Anyone can be an asshole and this kid is one and just so happens to be autistic.", "As someone who knew a guy with autism for 13 years and was in a relationship with him for almost 8 years and I have a 5 year old son with him\n\n\nNah, they can be assholes. \nNTA", "NTA. Using your disability as an excuse to be a shitty person is never okay.", "NTA. He won\u2019t learn what is and isn\u2019t acceptable if he is never reprimanded for his behavior. Being disabled, mentally ill, etc is not a free pass to treat others poorly. If the school is not correcting him and helping him learn social skills then they are doing him a massive disservice.", "NTA. This classmate is going to be running into some big problems when he leaves school. No one in the outside world is going to care if he is autistic.\n\nHis parents and your school are failing him.", "NTA unfortunately we humans always have to be on extreme side from extreme hate for the disabled for putting them on pedestal and they can't do wrong", "NTA\n\nI also have autism, and yeah, this guy is just an asshole. I think the reaction you got is because the conversation was about just the picture thing. Like, what he says about not knowing what's okay to do is just 100% true, that's what autism is. If he stops after being told its not okay then it was probably legitimate, and just not something you could call him an asshole over. However if he doesn't stop after this then it was just an excuse and if he keeps up the act he's bullshitting people.\n\nI feel like if you have a conversation with your dad and tell him about everything that you posted here then he'll understand you better.\n\nEven if all of his behaviour is just him being socially inept, which is genuinely possible, that doesn't mean he isn't being an asshole. He might not intend it that way, but it's horrible behaviour and you should never be forced to deal with that just because they have a disability.\n\nThe best advise I can give you is to:\n1. Don't let it get to you. No matter what others say this behaviour of his is not okay.\n2. Be direct with him. Remain calm and tell him when things are not okay to do or say. And tell him when he does something you don't like, and ask him not to do it again.\n\nIf he's a decent person then he'll try to listen to you, and won't bother you as much anymore. And as I said I have autism myself, I'm a few years older so I have plenty of experience. Trust me that if you're direct with him and he doesn't listen, then his autism isn't an excuse.", "NTA. I have son with Autism. In many cases it takes someone telling him that he is being an asshole before he gets it. It takes patience because to change behavior in someone with autism you have to convince them they are being an asshole while at the same time explaining what acceptable behavior is and you have to be specific and suggest canned responses that they may choose to employ in the future.  To learn to act normally in social situations my son had to memorize how to act and what to say. He would then choose to use repeatedly whichever ones worked best.  Sometimes you have to live them in spite of themselves. It\u2019s not easy but you will grow as a person just by the effort. Your feeling upset by this kid\u2019s behavior and your assertion that he is being an awhile are absolutely valid and understandable. Try to use the situation to grow personally and also to help him to grow by learning what is a good behavior and what is not. Do not beat yourself up needlessly.", "NTA. I have a family member who has been told their whole lives they're special and it doesn't matter what they do because they have autism (I genuinely believe that this is a forced diagnosis from one side of the family badgering the doctors for nearly 16 years). \n\nThey're rude, inconsiderate, downright cruel sometimes to their immediate family but it all gets brushed away because \"im special\". That's literally what they say. They're also super smart and calculating. They know exactly what they're doing and what the outcome will be from their actions but there's no consequences because insert BS excuse here. \n\nHalf of the family have completely cut this person out of their lives because we have no time for their BS and they don't like the fact that we don't bend over backwards to their every whim and want. \n\nIt's actually really sad because when this person grows up, they won't have any real friends, family won't want anything to do with them and others won't give their BS the time of day. \n\nThankfully, you'll only be around this person for a couple more years, then you never need to see them again. I wouldn't stop calling them on their behaviour though.", "NTA. That kid needs an ass beatin. If he\u2019s savvy enough to try and pull a \u201cpoor me\u201d act before getting called out only to then apologize and claim his autism is to blame, he\u2019s savvy enough to throw down. And ima be honest, some time without your phone can be quite peaceful and lead to find awesome ways to spend your time.", "He may have a crush on you. It seems like he's stalking you. Tell your teachers you don't want to sit near him in class. Document everything he does and then talk to your parents. \nGood luck", "NTA although the way you speak about autistic people in general is worrying. You\u2019re right that his behavior is problematic and shouldn\u2019t be excused, and a teacher or counselor should absolutely address it \u2014 but calling him an asshole was unnecessary and bordering on cruel. \n\nTl;dr have boundaries but don\u2019t resort to cruelty to get your point across, especially to someone with a disability", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also know many many people who fall in various places on the spectrum. 95% of them were absolutely amazing, sweet, and probably more intelligent than most people, but the rest tended to be a little more than most could handle as a result of how they were dealt with in highschool/throughout their lives. \n\nThe biggest issue with most schools, parents and other places is the fact that they tend to believe that people with mental/intellectual disabilities need to be coddled rather than taught and corrected. \n\nBeing autistic or disabled is NOT an excuse to be an asshole. \u201cNot knowing how to act or what\u2019s acceptable to do in public\u201d stops being an excuse after a while, especially if the person is constantly being instructed on what to do and what not to do.

A much simpler explanation is OP is bothered by autistic people and is simply an asshole. \n\nNow if there\u2019s actually an autism gang at his school, well then I owe an apology.

I know what I'm talking about. \n\nThere is such a gross misunderstanding of autism on this sub. The boys autism IS absolutely an explanation for his behaviour. Autism wouldn't exist if we could just switch it off and do better. An autistic person doing something antisocial doesn't make things harder for me as an autistic person either as anyone who understands the condition knows that it's a spectrum. And yes, some parts of that spectrum cause antisocial, obsessive and difficult to manage behaviours in some people that are impossible to moderate or control. \n\nThat doesn't mean to say that the school are dealing with this this correctly though. OP clearly feels their boundaries are being violated and they are not being supported and that is not okay. The teachers should be much more on this if the Autistic boy has tendencies to upset other people or act in antisocial ways. They should be putting measures in place to protect both the other kids at school and the Autistic boy as the current setup clearly isn't working. \n\nThe blame here is on the school and the way they manage their SEN not on any of the kids involved.", "This.

If the boy doesn't understand what they are saying which is likely as OP is describing someone who it seems is barely scraping by in a mainstream school. \n\nI work with autism every day. I see all levels of it and all the ways it affects people who have it. And I see the kind of behaviour described often.", "I disagree. I don't think you understand some aspects of the autism spectrum. I've worked with autistic kids who are serial arsonists and even sex offenders that are so because of their condition. It really does depend which bits of the brain are affected and what their intelligence and understanding of what they are saying and doing is. \n\nI mean no disrespect to autistic people by saying this. I'm autistic & I have qualifications in & work with autism. It's incorrect to not accept that there are both positive and negative traits that can come with being on the spectrum. I'm not saying everyone has to accept them. In fact if the behaviour is problematic then as I said measures need to be put in place to protect people and the school has failed OP. But to say that the boy absolutely knows what he is doing and can control it and do better, to assume that he is simply intentionally being an asshole, is incorrect."]}
