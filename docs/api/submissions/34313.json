Our daughter was prohibited communication with her half-siblings (only on my side but it is permitted with my wife's two older children) and my parents.\n\nI have started to put my foot down that I want to take my daughter to see her older half-siblings and get to know her grandparents as they are getting up in years. My wife is insisting that such meetings cannot happen without her.  My parents and older children are not ready to just accept my wife back into their lives as there is a lot of relationship repair that needs to happen first.\n\nI am the a-hole for insisting that my wife stays home and that my daughter should be able to see her family?  \n\nPS- My eldest has a wedding planned for the summer and my wife wants to go but by eldest doesn't want her there as they haven't even spoken in 11 years and the relationship was very hostile prior to that.\n\nMy wife and I just started some couples therapy this week.", "created_utc": 1704380502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yf64j/aita_my_wife_wont_allow_my_14_year_old_to_speak/", "score": 957, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our daughter was prohibited communication with her half-siblings (only on my side but it is permitted with my wife's two older children) and my parents.\n\nI have started to put my foot down that I want to take my daughter to see her older half-siblings and get to know her grandparents as they are getting up in years. My wife is insisting that such meetings cannot happen without her.  My parents and older children are not ready to just accept my wife back into their lives as there is a lot of relationship repair that needs to happen first.\n\nI am the a-hole for insisting that my wife stays home and that my daughter should be able to see her family?  \n\nPS- My eldest has a wedding planned for the summer and my wife wants to go but by eldest doesn't want her there as they haven't even spoken in 11 years and the relationship was very hostile prior to that.\n\nMy wife and I just started some couples therapy this week.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
