I am not going to provide more info on how much or how he abused me but it has truly been deeply damaging to my core and I never got closure for it. He never apologized or even acknowledged the abuse. That is the worst part to me. He also cheated on my mother before abandoning us. In the divorce, he pretty much cheated my mom out of everything (it was really my Mom\u2019s fault for being too trusting but regardless, he still acted unethically). His life-partner-girlfriend is the same woman that he cheated on my mother with and he left everything (low 7 figures) to her. This woman has also been exceptionally rude me my entire life. It is shit right out of Cinderella. Trying to deny me food if she\u2019s angry. Etc. Yet in my entire life I have never once criticized her, to anybody at all, even though she is the woman who my Dad abandoned me for.\n\nI have a very good chance of being able to successfully contest the will as I have been informed by my legal council.\n\nMy dad\u2019s girlfriend comes from an extremely poor, lower class background. I am usually very sympathetic to such situations however she is not garnering any sympathy from me currently, which makes me feel like a hypocrite. She has worked all her life but never made enough to save and never progressed up the ladder. If she doesn\u2019t get the will, she will probably work till the day she dies and live a poor life. She is also likely so poor that she cannot afford legal council and is at an information disadvantage compared to me as she is largely uneducated and uninformed about stuff. My dad was upper middle class. I am firmly upper class. \n\nI want to contest the will. However, I make more in a year than the entire contents of the will and I have more saved up as well. I would be taking money away from a poor person who needs the money. However, if I win, I plan to give the money to Prevent Child Abuse America or a similar charity. I truly have no use for the money and I do not want it. The real reason I want to contest the will is to give myself closure. I want to fuck over the person who abused me, abandoned me, and never took responsibility for their actions in their entire life. I want to fuck over the person who cheated on a fucking child without remorse and then proceeded to treat that child like garbage. It would give me closure to know that the first person\u2019s money is going towards child healthcare and the second person will die poor and alone. That money is mine by rights. It should belong to the only fucking child that my father had, not the woman he left him for, regardless of however much we both need it.\n\nBut obviously, this is extremely vengeful. I\u2019m not doing this primarily for charitable reasons.  I\u2019m doing this to fuck someone over.

Will this give you *true* closure? Probably not. *True* *closure* is very difficult to attain with abuse, especially at the magnitude you allude to. Will it make you\"feel better?\" Sure, I don't see why donating a large lump sum to a non-profit dedicated to preventing child abuse wouldn't make you feel good. But I don't think you'll get that *closure* you're looking for. Especially considering the person you truly want to target *the most* is dead.\n\nDonating the money, doing a \"good deed\" with it, doesn't really absolve you of initially being an AH in the first place. It's great, but irrelevant to your question.\n\nSo, would you be an AH for contesting the will and probably winning? Yes, and you already knew that. What is \"right\" legally vs morally are 2 different things. At the very least, if you went through with it, I'd give her a nest egg or trust so as not to leave her destitute. Be the bigger person here, at least somewhat. Acts of kindness, and even forgiveness, go further for true closure than you could ever imagine.", "NTA for contesting the will.

If you want to be really classy and alleviate any guilt, when you win, just give her a meagre retirement nest egg, like $200k or something.", "I don\u2019t think this will give you the closure you want.

I understand where you're coming from. But, as others have said, I don't think this will give you closure. At least, not in the way you might be hoping. \n\nBut you said that this woman has worked all her life and never saved any money. A lot of people who never learned to save money won't start all of a sudden. So, say you do nothing. Do you really think that this woman won't blow it within a few years? If not sooner.

You may ride the high of getting the money away from the girlfriend for a month or two, but then you will still be left to deal with the pain and the trauma. You might find that the taste of vengeance swiftly turns sour because you stooped to being cruel, just like her.\n\nIf this is how you want to spend your time, if this is what you need to do, then do it.

This is the homewrecker, I can't make myself care what happens to her but honestly, she probably had to put up with a lot of crap from him too and she stuck it out until he died.  You're TA for WHY you want to take the money...revenge on a dead guy.

Would you see this woman live in squalor to revenge yourself on your father and her and see it as a valid action? Please don't do this. Please. I beg you not to take your hatred of your father on her. I know she was his AP, but does she truly deserve this?

It can be hard to remember that in the midst of all the pain and rage that the goal is to be better, not bitter.

You have no evidence that she manipulated him into it (as in, he was elderly with signs of dementia). You don\u2019t have a right to his money. You did have a right to a decent childhood. Don\u2019t mix those two. Taking away the money from the person he wanted it to go to will not repair your childhood. What would actually help get you through it is to use your success to take care of your mother. That\u2019s a much more reasonable approach.", "ESH. Does this really need to be an all-or-nothing scenario? Why can\u2019t you request a 50-50 split in the inheritance when contesting the will? Your dad and his girlfriend are obviously not great people, but you also obviously are already feeling guilty for considering something that will leave a person destitute until their dying day. Even if you donate your portion as you mentioned, that guilt might never go away.

You seem really conflicted because you don\u2019t at all need the money and this would be pure vengeance. I would just say don\u2019t let their treatment of you co-opt you into doing something you don\u2019t believe in. If you do this, make sure it\u2019s really what you want.

If you are informed that you have a good chance of winning do it, especially if you are going to form a charity to help woman and children who went through the same things that you did. Will it bring you closure? It would me to be honest, I was a very abused child if alcoholic but religious cult member people and I help people out of those types of situations a lot. They need way more than your abuser and would it not be poetic that the man and woman who made you so miserable will be helping those in the same position as you. So yeah DO IT!", "NTA. So here\u2019s the thing. You can legally contest it, and you say you\u2019ve talked to an attorney about it (btw, it\u2019s counsel, not council).

I don't know where you're located but children aren't entitled to anything where I live and I'd be worried your lawyer is just trying to get billable hours from a rich client. Your own attitude that she's less educated than you and can't afford to hire a lawyer makes you sound smug and predatory and you're probably forgetting that she, if she's the executor of the will, can probably use his money to pay for the lawyer.\n\nIt's his money. He abandoned you and didn't want you to have his money. He built a life with a woman and saved his money to provide for her retirement. If anyone has a (moral) right to this it's your mother who was screwed over in the divorce.\n\nMaybe he was a jerk for not leaving anything to you, but people who contest wills rarely win and are \"right\" even less often. If you actually wanted to help other people you would donate your own money, this is 100% about feeling smug seeing his money go to a cause that would piss him off.", "ESH. You know you\u2019d be an AH and it seems like you\u2019re just trying to use Reddit to make yourself feel less guilty. Given your childhood and how your late father and girlfriend treated you, you are entitled to do whatever you feel is best for you to get closure. However, I honestly don\u2019t think it will give you the peace you are looking for and I suggest you think long and hard if what you are planning to do is something you will be proud of in the future. If revenge is truly what you want, go for it!", "You know you\u2019re being an asshole but if it gives you the closure you need then it\u2019s worth it. NTA", "What basis are you able to contest the will? INFO", "NTA for contesting the will if you have a valid legal basis for it. However, I feel like I have to warn you that the 'revenge' of doing this isn't going to change anything that happened to you or make you feel better about it in the long run. I understand your feelings towards the woman you feel broke up your family since I felt the same way about the woman my father left my mother for. My father died over 30 years ago and I still want nothing at all to do with her (like I don't even want to hear her name) but when I had the chance to 'get even' with her, I chose not to. She lied to us about the townhouse she and my father bought being 'joint tenancy with right of survivorship' which would have meant his half became hers when he died. We found out 10 years later when she tried to sell it that it wasn't true and my brother and I were actually entitled to 25% each. Even though she had gone as far as to bring her lawyer TO THE FUNERAL HOME during my father's funeral to try to get us to sign over his bank account to her (which is a whole other story that did not work out for her) as well as other things that were just despicable, I chose to take the high road and sign over a quit claim deed since she had paid all the expenses for it for those 10 years. I could have used the money since I was a single mom at the time, but I just didn't feel like it was the right thing to do. In my mind, she will get everything she deserves in the long run and I have a clear conscience knowing that I could have hurt her (maybe not as bad as bad as she hurt me as a kid, but still a pretty good blow) but I chose not to. I think the universe or God or karma or whatever will eventually pay her back for what she did. Good luck to you either way. I hope you get the closure you feel you need in this situation.", "NTA. Do it!", "Nta do it karma", "So this is less a judgement and more advice. It\u2019s clear that this is still pretty raw for you and your emotions surrounding this will take time to unpack. But, unfortunately, the situation is time bound, so if you do t act now there will be little you can do. \n\nMy advice would be to challenge the will. Once you win, though, don\u2019t do anything with it immediately. Sit on it while you go back to therapy and start processing your feelings about this. You may find that you feel guilty about the situation she\u2019s been left in. In that case, the money is still there and you can gift it back to her (the advantage of course being then this is a generous gift from you which you did not need to do and she gets to live her life in the knowledge that she owes what she has to a child she abused). Or you may find that this does give you some kind of closure and you want to donate all of it. \n\nThe point being, if you don\u2019t challenge the will in the time legally allowed for this, the situation cannot be rectified and you may always regret it. But if you do and change your mind, the situation can easily be rectified and the money returned. Morally, is it the right thing to do? Maybe not. But sometimes we don\u2019t act morally because it hurts us in some way. Be kind to yourself and talk about this with your therapist.", "NTA- you are right.\n\nIf your legal challenge is successful the money will find its way to a deserving charity that will put it to good use. \n\nThen you will be able to focus on putting the past behind you whilst knowing that your father and his partner did not get their own way in the end as far as you & the money were concerned. Hopefully you will one day be able to look back on your childhood & early adult years during your father's lifetime without rage or experiencing any powerful negative emotions. \n\nGood luck and take care of yourself!", "NTA. Do it.", "ESH - here we go:\n\n>in my entire life I have never once criticized her, to anybody at all\n\nI doubt that\n\n>I make more in a year than the entire contents of the will and I have more saved up as well. I would be taking money away from a poor person who needs the money.\n\nFull stop.  That's where you're the asshole, and there's no going back from that, no matter who's ass you stuff with money afterwards.\n\nLastly, one asshole to another.   Fuck her.  You do you.  If the roles were reversed, she'd rob you blind, dude.  You didn't get to where you are by not being an asshole, lets be honest.", "NTA. Use the money to pay for your therapy since they are the ones who caused you to need therapy.", "NTA. You aren't going to get closure. Maybe you can get some satisfaction. Perhaps you should have a chat with the girlfriend. Tell her what you were thinking of doing and why. That should scare her. Would her crying and being remorseful give you any feeling of peace?

You're not doing this to hoard money. It's a punishment for people that deserve it.", "ESH (except probably your Mum) also, it's not relevant but that money is not \"mine by rights\".

It\u2019s all about her not reaping the benefits of her destructive influence.
