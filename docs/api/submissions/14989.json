If you were straight and expressed a preference for not dating players because you didn\u2019t want to get hurt, your friends would back you up. This is no different. \n\nYour life, your lady parts - your choice. All the best finding love - and finding some better friends while you\u2019re at it\u2026", "NTA. Tina is the worst kind of \"ally\" -- someone who says she understands and will support you, but invalidates your lived experience and says she knows better. I say worst because at least direct homophobia is easy to spot, but this kind of behaviour is insidious and can make you doubt yourself a lot. I've lived through this myself (with regards to queer \"allies\") and it sucks.\n\nAlso: allies don't make it about them. She 100% did! Who cares about her feelings, it's literally _your_ love life. Who the hell is she to say you should let other people experiment with you at the cost of your own wellbeing?!?\n\nDon't doubt yourself.

People need to be upfront about things like this. Whether it\u2019s exploring sexuality or being on open/poly relationships.", "Who you decide to get emotionally involved with and intimate isn\u2019t your friend\u2019s business at all to judge you wrong for your own personal choice. You aren\u2019t interested in a one night stand or friends with benefits. Plenty others can help this person figure out if she is a lesbian or not. I think her not being gay and not understanding wasn\u2019t valid. She is guilty of being clueless she was pressuring you to do what she thinks you should do. NTA. She pushed you to being exasperated and you got snarly. An opinion she managed to take it from just an opinion to pecking away to change your mind, ignoring your feelings.", "NTA She absolutely can have an opinion and you\u2019re absolutely within your rights to have a different opinion or not to care about hers.", "NTA. You are correct to protect yourself from potential heartache.  Your ex needs to keep her opinions to herself.", "NTA at all\n\n\"she doesn\u2019t see what the big deal is. \"\n\nAnd that is the problem. She doesn't understand what it feels like. I am not sure if it is because she is straight or unempathetic.", "NTA this is compatible to situation when you are dating to have committed relationship and the other person tells they are just looking for friends with benefits. In the end you don't owe anyone your attention.", "NTA, Tina needs to pipe down. It's you who really matters, looks like Tina is jealous or something.", "NTA. Since Tina doesn\u2019t see what the big deal is, she can give Sarah a chance and \u201cdip her toe\u201d into the waters herself then. Or, just maybe, she could mind her own business. You don\u2019t owe Sarah or anyone else a date/a relationship and Sarah is fine with being just friends, so why can\u2019t Tina accept that?", "NTA  \n\n\nBut do cut your friend a tiny bit of slack.  You can tell her intentions are mostly good, she just isn't seeing the picture in full and her execution is kinda messy.  \n\n\nAbove all else, you are right though; you're not a guinea pig, nor should you feel like just because you have an understanding about your own sexuality, should that mean that people who aren't should find you to be a tool to understand their own.  \n\n\nI'm sorry that your romantic life may seem to have taken a side turn since first girl, but it's very mature of you to want to remain friends with Sarah.  \n\n\nIf you want to pave things over with Tina, just sit her down and tell her about how you're not in any rush to take unnecessary risks.   You could maybe help her understand the situation by asking her something along the lines of;  \n\n\n \"Well what if a really prestigious school decided to let you in on a new kind of scholarship program, then halfway through your studies you find out that they actually didn't have the funding and they have to remove you from it.  Now you feel like your investment, time, and aspirations were wasted just because the school wanted to 'Just try things out'\"  \n\n\nI know it's not the perfect analogy but it would get her in the mindset of seeing the picture as emotional and physical investment rather than \"just experimenting.\"", ">I said I understood and there\u2019s probably plenty of women willing to do that\n\n>She also added she sees why my ex didn\u2019t tell me as this proves it\u2019ll be hard for people like her and Sarah to truly experiment. I finally said I don\u2019t care about her opinion as she isn\u2019t gay and she\u2019ll never understand.\n\nNAH. If you can acknowledge there are plenty of women who would be ok with it but follow that up with saying your friend can't understand because she isn't gay, you're being inconsistent. Either gay people themselves have differing opinions on this and therefore her not agreeing with you isn't a straight thing or gay people mostly agree in which case she's right and that kind of attitude makes it difficult for people who are questioning to be honest and still get dates. \n\nWomen get their hearts broken all the time. The idea that a woman can't understand heartbreak and/or being or feeling lied to just because she's not gay is pretty ridiculous. The reality is that straight women just have significantly worse partner options despite straight relationships themselves being more accepted.", "I think you'd be a soft AH on this one, as it's more to do with the delivery of saying that you \"didn't care\" for Tina's opinion as such. It could have been worded differently, and to give some sort of \"more definitive\" response to your reasoning.\n\nWhere I can understand the sentiment that you don't want to be \"roped along in an experiment\" and feel that you'd need that security of wanting honesty in a potential relationship, it isn't fair as such to dismiss somebody's opinion just because they're not of the same sexuality as yourself. \n\nThe sentiment could be there for those who may feel as though they're not ready for a relationship - regardless if they're pan, hetero, gay, or any other sexuality.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's the internet age baby, there are *resources* for anyone's curiosity. As an elder gay I gotta say that it is a lovely gift when we want to help people to understand us. It is NOT an entitlement, it is not a constant responsibility. Our responsibility is to survive and thrive.", "This. If OP decides to explain more to her friend, that's understandable in context given their relationship. (I would probably do the same once I had sat with my anger a while.)

Also the \"ally\" thing is clearly BS. Her telling you what to do and how to feel about your body is living proof.", "NTA. She\u2019s being ridiculous. This is no different than a man telling a woman he just wants to kick it but she\u2019s looking for a life partner. They aren\u2019t compatible.

Tina is saying that it is okay for people to use lesbians as guinea pigs to figure out their own desires. That is okay *if* they are upfront about it, or if they are dating women who want short term flings so there is a mutual understanding that neither party is looking for/ready for, as the case may be, a committed relationship. Dating someone for six months without mentioning that actually you are intentionally doing this to \"see\" if you are into women is not okay. Having a one or two or three night stand with a woman on Tinder looking for a brief casual thing to \"see\" if you are into women, or putting in your profile that you are questioning and wanting to date women to figure that out--that's fine. \n\nThe fact that you and Tina both seem to not get what the actual problem here is is evidence that what OP said is correct. You don't understand. \n\nAnd your last sentence? Let's just not.", "That's not true. There are so many people, regardless of sexual orientation who just don't know how to life without a parent so they judge everyone who has standards.

Tina belittled and tried to invalidate your feelings. Why are your mutual friends overlooking that?

You have done nothing wrong and you were correct in saying Tina just doesn\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve been burned before by someone who was experimenting and don\u2019t want to be burned again. That is totally valid and reasonable. It\u2019s understandable to want to pursue relationships with people who know what they want and also want an actual lesbian relationship vs just to be an \u201cexperiment\u201d to someone. \n\nIt was good that Sarah was honest and communicated this with you early on so you could make an informed decision on whether or not you should continue the relationship.", "NTA you don\u2019t need to be the experiment for every maybe not so straight woman out there wondering if she\u2019s a lesbian. Experimentation is great but you\u2019re not responsible for it.", "NTA- Ask her how she would feel if a guy broke it off with her after 6 months because he was using her to see if he was \"actually\" attracted to women.  I don't think she would love being a guinea pig herself.", "I hate that you went through it the first time and thought Tina was a friend so you confided in her. There is not one thing different between any 2 people regardless of sex, color, creed or religion, using someone to determine if you are interested in their lifestyle, choice or way of life is absolutely ridiculous. You are not a new toy to be played with to see if they like it.\n\nTo say it's different means your ability to experience pain or live is somehow different than a straight person. It's not because we all bleed the same color and all have emotions that should not be toyed with. \n\nWhen any person decides to get involved with someone, it is usually because they have things in common and are attracted to them, the real them.  The one thing you should know is if you have the simple concept of your sexual orientation. \n\nAsk your friend if she would be OK with a guy man telling her that he wants to date her to see if he is actually straight.

I've had women tell me they don't date bi women because we'll \"leave them for a man\". It's really, really hurtful.\n\nI am not experimenting. I am definitely bi.

You don\u2019t owe anyone a date, ever, queer or not. You know your preferences, and uncertainty in a partner isn\u2019t one of them. How would she feel committing herself to a dude with the understanding that he may decide he thinks women are gross at any time? It wouldn\u2019t feel good. That being said, I was on the other side many years ago, and I ended up getting with some really unsavory lesbians who didn\u2019t mind exploiting a baby gay because the nice girls felt as you did lol.

They wanted to \"win\" me over from my nesting partner. Or thought they could convince me they were the individual I needed to be enough to get me to be monogamous. \n\nMy SO, my nesting partner, leans towards being ambiamorous.\n\nPersonally,  since you say you don't have a lot of experience with relationships, I'd say it's pretty normal to be fluid in your preferences."]}
