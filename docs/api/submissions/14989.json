If you were straight and expressed a preference for not dating players because you didn\u2019t want to get hurt, your friends would back you up. This is no different. \n\nYour life, your lady parts - your choice. All the best finding love - and finding some better friends while you\u2019re at it\u2026", "NTA. Tina is the worst kind of \"ally\" -- someone who says she understands and will support you, but invalidates your lived experience and says she knows better. I say worst because at least direct homophobia is easy to spot, but this kind of behaviour is insidious and can make you doubt yourself a lot. I've lived through this myself (with regards to queer \"allies\") and it sucks.\n\nAlso: allies don't make it about them. She 100% did! Who cares about her feelings, it's literally _your_ love life. Who the hell is she to say you should let other people experiment with you at the cost of your own wellbeing?!?\n\nDon't doubt yourself. You are in the right, it sucks to be someone's guinea pig or training wheels, you've drawn a healthy boundary clearly. Wishing you all the best in the dating game OP, it's tough out there.", "No. You don't want to be in a relationship with someone who isn't even sure the two of you are compatible.Tina's opinion doesn't make any sense.", "NTA - if you switched it around and asked her if a guy she had dated waited 6 months to tell her that he only did it to explore his sexuality she absolutely would be hurt. People need to be upfront about things like this. Whether it\u2019s exploring sexuality or being on open/poly relationships.", "Who you decide to get emotionally involved with and intimate isn\u2019t your friend\u2019s business at all to judge you wrong for your own personal choice. You aren\u2019t interested in a one night stand or friends with benefits. Plenty others can help this person figure out if she is a lesbian or not. I think her not being gay and not understanding wasn\u2019t valid. She is guilty of being clueless she was pressuring you to do what she thinks you should do. NTA. She pushed you to being exasperated and you got snarly. An opinion she managed to take it from just an opinion to pecking away to change your mind, ignoring your feelings.", "NTA She absolutely can have an opinion and you\u2019re absolutely within your rights to have a different opinion or not to care about hers.", "NTA. You are correct to protect yourself from potential heartache.  Your ex needs to keep her opinions to herself.", "NTA at all\n\n\"she doesn\u2019t see what the big deal is. \"\n\nAnd that is the problem. She doesn't understand what it feels like. I am not sure if it is because she is straight or unempathetic.", "NTA this is compatible to situation when you are dating to have committed relationship and the other person tells they are just looking for friends with benefits. In the end you don't owe anyone your attention.", "NTA, Tina needs to pipe down. It's you who really matters, looks like Tina is jealous or something.", "NTA. Since Tina doesn\u2019t see what the big deal is, she can give Sarah a chance and \u201cdip her toe\u201d into the waters herself then. Or, just maybe, she could mind her own business. You don\u2019t owe Sarah or anyone else a date/a relationship and Sarah is fine with being just friends, so why can\u2019t Tina accept that?", "NTA  \n\n\nBut do cut your friend a tiny bit of slack.  You can tell her intentions are mostly good, she just isn't seeing the picture in full and her execution is kinda messy.  \n\n\nAbove all else, you are right though; you're not a guinea pig, nor should you feel like just because you have an understanding about your own sexuality, should that mean that people who aren't should find you to be a tool to understand their own.  \n\n\nI'm sorry that your romantic life may seem to have taken a side turn since first girl, but it's very mature of you to want to remain friends with Sarah.  \n\n\nIf you want to pave things over with Tina, just sit her down and tell her about how you're not in any rush to take unnecessary risks.   You could maybe help her understand the situation by asking her something along the lines of;  \n\n\n \"Well what if a really prestigious school decided to let you in on a new kind of scholarship program, then halfway through your studies you find out that they actually didn't have the funding and they have to remove you from it.  Now you feel like your investment, time, and aspirations were wasted just because the school wanted to 'Just try things out'\"  \n\n\nI know it's not the perfect analogy but it would get her in the mindset of seeing the picture as emotional and physical investment rather than \"just experimenting.\"", ">I said I understood and there\u2019s probably plenty of women willing to do that\n\n>She also added she sees why my ex didn\u2019t tell me as this proves it\u2019ll be hard for people like her and Sarah to truly experiment. I finally said I don\u2019t care about her opinion as she isn\u2019t gay and she\u2019ll never understand.\n\nNAH. If you can acknowledge there are plenty of women who would be ok with it but follow that up with saying your friend can't understand because she isn't gay, you're being inconsistent. Either gay people themselves have differing opinions on this and therefore her not agreeing with you isn't a straight thing or gay people mostly agree in which case she's right and that kind of attitude makes it difficult for people who are questioning to be honest and still get dates. \n\nWomen get their hearts broken all the time. The idea that a woman can't understand heartbreak and/or being or feeling lied to just because she's not gay is pretty ridiculous. The reality is that straight women just have significantly worse partner options despite straight relationships themselves being more accepted.", "I think you'd be a soft AH on this one, as it's more to do with the delivery of saying that you \"didn't care\" for Tina's opinion as such. It could have been worded differently, and to give some sort of \"more definitive\" response to your reasoning.\n\nWhere I can understand the sentiment that you don't want to be \"roped along in an experiment\" and feel that you'd need that security of wanting honesty in a potential relationship, it isn't fair as such to dismiss somebody's opinion just because they're not of the same sexuality as yourself. \n\nThe sentiment could be there for those who may feel as though they're not ready for a relationship - regardless if they're pan, hetero, gay, or any other sexuality.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's the internet age baby, there are *resources* for anyone's curiosity. As an elder gay I gotta say that it is a lovely gift when we want to help people to understand us. It is NOT an entitlement, it is not a constant responsibility. Our responsibility is to survive and thrive.", "This. If OP decides to explain more to her friend, that's understandable in context given their relationship. (I would probably do the same once I had sat with my anger a while.)

I'm pansexual and polyamorous.\n\nI don't get a lot of girlfriends because most are too worried about me still dating men. They've been burned by bisexual/pansexual women. Sucks, but you can't force that sort of thing.\n\nAnd the polyamory stuff. Ton of people not okay with it. I'd be so pissed if someone started dating me saying they were cool with it then 6 months in admitted they really were monogamous and were just dipping their toes into the idea of polyamory.", "Am i the only one thinking the friend might be questioning her own sexuality, and projecting her own insecurities about exploring that onto OP's relationships?"]}
