I have 4 kids, 3 with my husband and my son from a previous relationship. Right now I'm struggling to keep afloat in this economy as I\u2019m sure many of us are. Waiting on SS benefits & life insurance but my bills are paid, there is food in the kitchen\u2026 no junk food or treats but food nonetheless. \n\n\nMy FIL never warmed up to my son. He isn\u2019t mean to him, he just doesn\u2019t go out of his way like he does the other 3. Tonight he came to me asking if he could do some chores to get money for snacks & yummy food. I told him things are really hard right now so I don\u2019t have \u201cchore\u201d money but hopefully soon I could. He then asks how his siblings got snack money if I didn\u2019t have money to give him. I said they don\u2019t? I asked my kids what he meant and apparently their grandpa has been bringing them special treats and food when I\u2019m at work but telling my son they give him money for it. So that's why my son gets nothing. \n\n\nMy FIL also has been ordering food for lunch but making my son eat what I have in the kitchen. My grief has made me a total zombie that I didn\u2019t know this was going on. I confronted my FIL and he got defensive. He told me I couldn\u2019t tell him to not spoil his grandchildren, his \u201cflesh and blood\u201d. That his grandchildren lost their father and by spoiling them, he is helping them grieve. Completely discrediting my son\u2019s loss like he didn\u2019t lose a dad himself. My husband loved and treated him like his own. I\u2019m furious but I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\n\nYes, my son isn\u2019t my FIL\u2019s blood grandchild but it\u2019s incredibly cruel. I need my FIL to be here but it\u2019s upsetting my son. My FIL said he would continue to do as he pleases and to not tell him what he can or can\u2019t do. \n\nAITA?\n\nThrowaway for privacy", "created_utc": 1667443401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykq57e/aita_for_telling_my_fil_he_cant_bring_special/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know your FIL is grieving too, but his exclusion of your son is unacceptable. \n\nCan you have a calm conversation with FIL? Explain that you don\u2019t want to deprive him of \u2018spoiling\u2019 his grandkids, but that he is causing harm to a child your husband loved dearly?\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t accept the part he\u2019s playing here, then you\u2019ll have some tough choices about contract to make in the future.", "NTA. Your FIL is a prick and his favoritism is obviously hurting your son. If he can't behave like a grown adult then he shouldn't be treated like one. I'd ask for help from someone else.", "Depends on how badly you need him there. But if you can do without him..., I'd nicely suggest that if he wants to keep his relationship going with his grandkids, he has to be fair in giving out treats. Not necessarily time, but, if he gives his ice cream, they all get ice cream. And if he can't stop bullying your kid, you may have to rethink if he is a good enough human to be in your kids life.", "NTA. Your FIL is the AH and, frankly, a poor excuse for a man. He could step up to help your son too but intentionally excludes him. I'm furious just reading about it.", "Ages of kids? Maybe your son can babysit and make some money that way. Your FIL is a cold hearted asshole. What an awful way to behave.", "NTA\n\nTell your oldest son the truth. As soon as the kids benefits come in, grandpa is fired.", "NTA\n\nGrandpa is the AH here. He\u2019s an AH for blatantly excluding one of your kids in front of the others, and an even bigger AH for not stopping when you asked him to.", "NTA - Oof imagine looking at a kid who lost a father (step father, or whatever) and actively excluding him around his siblings. Just the lack of compassion or humanity in an act like that. \n\nHe's definitely the asshole. I'm sorry for your loss.", "Definitely NTA.  That\u2019s a special kind of horrible. If you can, I would put a lot of distance between him and your family.", "NTA, and that FIL is doing damage that will be impossible to undo. Cut that shit off ASAP.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. It sounds like this is always how he's treated the kids? So I'm a bit torn in that this should have been nipped in the bud YEARS ago, but especially needs to be stopped now. He cannot alienate your son from his siblings like that. It will cause resentment and you need to put your foot down and tell him if he can't be fair then his access to the kids will decrease. \n\nBut also, does your son have a relationship with his biological father and that part of his family?", "Nta....omg wish you could find a new grandpa...when my dad became a grandpa if he bought something for his granddaughter he bought something for whoever was her playmate that day( and she usually had a different playmate everyday lol so imagine those treats). Grandpa shouldn't discriminate because he wouldn't like it if someone decides to treat your son and leave his grands out.", "NTA\n\nYour FIL sure is one though.", "Please be repeatedly and forcefully clear with him, in front of all of the children, that his dead son did see that child as his own. Repeat ad nauseum. Please.\n\nNTA", "Look I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re real or not but someone acting like this is some kind of special fucked up. Sadly also doesn\u2019t seem to be out of bounds for peoples behaviour nowadays. You\u2019re not TA very obviously.", "NTA and you're right that he is being really cruel. Someone that can be that heartless to your child shouldn't be allowed to be around any of the children.\n\nHe is teaching your children that it is okay to treat people badly, and I'm sure that isn't something you want instilled in your kids.\n\nHe is also trying to bully you into allowing him to treat your son as less than because he knows that you need him to watch the children. He is taking advantage of your desperate situation.", "ESH.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be acting like that to one kid. He needs to either reward all kids he\u2019s babysitting for free, or none of them. \n\nBut you\u2019re also using him for free childcare. \n\nFind a way to pay for your own childcare so you don\u2019t have to let someone with favoritism be your free babysitter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
