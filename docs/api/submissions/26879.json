Lives off you while saving or spending her whole paycheck?\n\nDo you make that much more money than her that her contribution is only 20%?\n\nThat\u2019s would be a bigger issue for me.", "I guess it depends when the last time you brought this idea up? If it\u2019s been years then yes you should have sat down again. Explain with this promotion and your assets before marriage is what you are using. You would not be asking permission but letting her know it\u2019s time.\n\nYou also mentioned that you want to support your parents in retirement. What does this look like? I think the house is amazing but I would want the details on the other amount. The reason is now it would be joint finances. What if one parent gets sick and needs long term care, what if you lost your job would she have to pay, what if you died before them? This part is a lot to ask of her so talk through this part in detail", "NTA. Your pre-marital assets are YOURS. Your fun money is for you to use as you see fit - the way her fun money is for her to use as she sees fit. Plus, you had already told her what you were going to do, and you have not touched any shared funds.

You were fully entitled to pay off your parent's house, particularly as you used your private funds, but it's nonetheless an AH move to make a financial decision of that scale without even alerting your wife about it in advance. However, your wife definitely sounds like her financial expectations for your marriage are a bit jacked up, hence the ESH.", "So your wife is upset you kept your word? :thinking:\n\nNTA, if she was truly aware, and she is making a stink about it now she was most definitely going to try and prevent you from doing it.", "Nta, i would only say you could be barely if you didn\u2019t inform her beforehand.

There\u2019s not information here to make a determination that this was a reasonable action because all the factors surrounding financial planning can rarely be boiled down to a few paragraphs.  For example, how old is OP\u2019s parents?  How much was the remaining mortgage?  How much savings does his parents have for retirement?  Does OP\u2018s parents need financial support?  What happens if OP\u2019s parents have unforeseen costs that\u2019s not covered by his fun money?  Who is going to pay for that?  What is OP\u2019s parents\u2019 health insurance situation and potential health risks for the future.  What if OP\u2019s parents are in their early fifties or late forties?  Should OP and his wife be expected to support his parents until the end of their lives?  Also, does OP and his wife have job security or his field of work subject to economic cycles or other circumstances?  How was OP\u2019s house paid off?  What if the wife used her separate income to pay off the house for them, and as a result, thus giving OP more flexibility in his budget?  Is it fair for OP to use to flexibility to benefit his parents solely.    \n\n\nOP\u2019s wife is upset that he didn\u2019t discuss this major financial decision with her.  Even if he told her beforehand, he should have made it point to discuss it once more before pulling the trigger.  A couple can both love a house and agree it\u2019s their dream home, but one person can\u2019t make the decision to buy the house or put even a deposit down before confirming both people are on the same page.", "YTA for not giving her a heads up what the hell just because it was planned doesnt mean you can do something like this with no warning. There are a lot of things people plan to do but still tell their spouse before they do them", "NTA.   If it was from your own segregated funds then it's a non-issue.", "Honestly, I have to say ESH\n\nYou have joint finances and this should have been a discussion.", "Nta", "Yes, marriage is about communication.", "NTA  She kinda smells like a gold digger...", "YTA--not only to your wife, but to yourself because you're damaging your marriage.\n\nYou're married.  You should agree on and discuss major financial decisions.  Some people decide to have a different kind of arrangement, but you and your wife clearly have not made an agreement where one of you spends a vast amount of money without discussing it.", "YTA - it's not that bad, since it was premarital assets, but I still don't understand why you wouldn't at least mention it to your wife beforehand, if it's such a \"non-issue\" as you say it is.", "NTA  but you feel your wife should have some skin in the game but not your parents? Curious how you two have your beneficiaries set up because if I was her I'd make my parents  my beneficiary to make you have skin in the game after my death.", "NTA.\n\nPeople who come from money are weird and thing differently. The concept of helping family is abnormal to them, because daddy always paid for it.", "Errr....what?\n\nYour wife knew this was your plan, didn't fight then, but fought when you went and did it?\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here's the thing: calling them pre-marital assets is not quite accurate. Almost wanted to say esh. What happens if you were to divorce depends on your state and any contracts you made. But generally speaking, your assets are considered merged even if you keep things separate. So the one thing that sticks is not telling her you were about to act on your word, but I can't entirely hold you to blame because *she knew your word and did not fight about it when you said you would do this in the future*.\n\n(And I hate to be morbid, but unless these are the kind of rich folk to never leave anything to children because *work ethic*, then she really has nothing to worry about)", "[deleted]", "Of course YTA, not for doing some righteous good for your folks, for acting unilaterally and clearly feeling that you are entitled to all the credit here.
