Thank you all for your comments. I\u2019m going to answer a few questions that have been asked numerous times. \nI am trying to read all of the comments and reply to them as well. If your comment got deleted, feel free to message me. Thank you!\n\n1: My husband does work during the day. We both do. I nanny 2 kids and the family allows me to bring my son with me. My husband works an office job. I work 7-4 everyday. He works 8:30-5 everyday. \n\n2: I brought it up last night and he claimed he\u2019s tired after working all day. I tried to explain that it makes me feel like he views this as babysitting and he said he can see where I am coming from, so we will see how the situation progresses.\n\n3: He did not show any signs of being an absent parent prior to our marriage. Prior to conceiving, we talked about expectations and we were on the same page. As our son got older, he started developing problems with helping care for him. \n\n4: I shouldn\u2019t have to address this, but. I don\u2019t shower every day because when I do, it causes problems. It irritates my skin and causes my husband and I to argue more. \n\n5: He doesn\u2019t always shower while our son sleeps either. My son and I leave for work at 6:30 and he has from then until around 7:30 when he leaves and he has been showering then.\n\n6: I take long showers because I have long hair and I have to shave every time because my skin is too sensitive. Also, it\u2019s pretty much my only alone time. \n\n7: I do the majority of the housework and caring for our son. I have tried to get him to help and it\u2019s often a fight. I usually cook, clean and care for our son. This is actually another sticking point in our marriage. \n\n8: People have brought up cutting out time on the weekend for alone time and I will start implementing that. I am thinking we each get 1.5 hours on Saturday to take time for ourselves?\n_______________________________________________\n\nI know it sounds like a simple problem, but it\u2019s been a sore spot for a while. We have a 2yr old. I don\u2019t always get a chance to shower in the morning and after he goes to bed I like the time to unwind. \nWell husband says I should be showering when our child asleep. Like before he wakes up or after he goes to bed. I already wake up at 5:45 to go to work (and I bring my son). He said I should be waking up earlier or waiting until he goes to bed. \nI feel that\u2019s unfair and there\u2019s no reason I shouldn\u2019t be able to do the basic human necessity of showering regardless if he\u2019s asleep or not. \nI do take longer showers (30 mins roughly) but I don\u2019t shower everyday because my hair can\u2019t take it. \nI have no time by myself and it\u2019s also nice for that reason. \nAITA??", "created_utc": 1700268617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xu553/aita_my_25f_husband_27m_keeps_getting_upset_about/", "score": 1776, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would take me that amount of time to just wash my body, with the wash cloth? I also have long hair, and getting it rinsed out properly can take several minutes by itself. When you say you can do shampoo + conditioner + face + body wash in 5-10mn, I feel like you must be swiping your hand across your chest and calling it clean, lolsob  \nOr like you're timing yourself out and literally racing, the equivalent of running after the bus at the bus stop, except every day in your shower, on purpose, for... no reason that I can tell? \n\nIt's just wild to me.

Easy enough on days where I don't wash my hair, and in drought conditions I'd certainly stick to that on those days.  On a wash day that would be impossible if I want to actually have it properly cleaned and conditioned and not frying under left-in rinseout conditioner.  Rinseout conditioner should never be left in, the PH is all wrong for it.  I could certainly turn the water off while letting the conditioner sit for a few minutes, but it takes *time* to rinse the conditioner out of my hair.\n\nAnd I have to condition it to detangle it.  If I detangle with no conditioner in the shower, it will stretch and break instead of detangling.  If I brush it while it's dry, it puffs into an easily-tangled mess and within 5 minutes of putting the brush down it looks like I've never even heard of grooming.  This was my life until I learned that hair which is not straight needs to be cared for differently.  I thought my hair was just unruly.  It isn't.  It's just wavy to slightly curly in some places and needs different care than I was giving it.\n\nThank goodness I don't grow hair on my legs (common among my mother's family, who are Native American) or I'd be expected to work shaving them into this routine, too!

And yeah, you can turn the water on and off, but still.\n\nI'm going to guess you got the most pushback from women, POC with textured hair, and people with small children.  A flat 4 minute recommendation doesn't account for everyone's needs, and will tend to get people who feel like they can't meet that standard to throw their hands up in the air and give up, which is not what anyone wants.  Even when it's emphasized that it's only a recommendation, this will still often be the result.\n\nI get that *you* didn't set policy on this, so this isn't at you, but damn.  It'd be better to suggest that people reduce as much as they can, and offer suggestions for how to do that (so things like turning the water on and off while shaving or letting conditioner sit), rather than pushing some arbitrary time limit which is particularly easy for men with straight, short hair (whose shaving time it's worth noting generally happens *outside* the shower, unlike women's shaving) and ignoring the differing needs of others.\n\nHey women, keep yourselves *impeccably* groomed to these specific standards, or you're a failure as a woman and a professional, but don't *dare* use water doing the things we deem necessary to meet them, you shallow creatures!", "I think it depends on what you are doing in there. Men in general take shorter showers because they don\u2019t have to shave legs, deal with longer hair etc. 30 min is really reasonable for me on days I wash my hair (on days I don\u2019t need to shave or wash my hair I can be done in 10 min too).", "\"Cancelling a word\" that's just semantics, which are in fact important in this scenario\n\nBabysitting is a job when you do not \"own\" the baby.

Parenting, while a job that is unpaid, does not. I'm a psychologist, which is a regulated term, but most of my patients just say \"therapist\" which is not regulated. I've had family members say \"oh, you're my therapist and for free!\" and I have to shut that down because I'm not their therapist, I'm their relative who talks to them, just as a parent who cares for his children is being a parent, not a contracted babysitter.
