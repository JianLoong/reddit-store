It's just a nice girl with a really great dress and hairstyle. The toddler princess is into being pretty and being the protagonist of her own story. Meet it on its own terms.", "YTA\n\nAre you upset that the attention is not on you... or is it  that YOU want to be the princess?\n\nIt's OK OP. Let your princess flag fly.

Like, what did you gain from ruining their fun to the point where your wife changed her clothes??", "YTA. You crushed your wife's feelings. My heart would be broken if my husband did this ish to me while we were playing. And to add insult to injury, you did it right in front of your daughter.

You said it right there: she\u2019s playing with your daughter. Part of the parenting process is playing along. But it isn\u2019t about you or her, it\u2019s about your daughter. And you shattered the illusion of whatever they were playing in that moment and then brushed your kid off when she said something about it.

You\u2019re a parent.", "YTA\n\nDude, some of my favourite shared memories with my younger brothers involve our ma getting involved and joining us on our level. Walking around town etc doing pokemon impressions to keep us entertained whilst we were shopping? Bet your ass she joined in, because it kept us close AND we weren't complaining about the boring shit.\n\nIt's why she was the favourite mom of the estates I grew up on - she was willing to join us all on our level, and when she was too busy to play for hours she'd still stick her head out to us. Hell, she even staged a photoshoot with me and some childhood friends so that we still felt she was involved, even though she was cleaning the house.\n\nPerhaps you need to get better at interacting with your kid.", "YTA I guess they won\u2019t ask you to play Prince Charming anytime soon.", "That's your wife, dude. Play along.

I'm glad your daughter stood up for her", "Bro you\u2019re such a buzzkill. Your wife is just going along with your daughter. YTA. Come on dude. Did you think you would be anything else", "Yes, YTA. She isn\u2019t delusional, she doesn\u2019t need you to remind her that she isn\u2019t actually a princess. \n\nAre you also the dad that takes joy in ruining Santa and the belief in unicorns because you\u2019re \u201cright\u201d? \n\nBeing an adult is boring a lot of the time; bills, chores, jobs\u2026 the fact that your wife bonding and playing with your daughter doesn\u2019t tick the reality boxes for you is kind of obnoxious.", "YTA.

Idk what crawled up your bum, but you need to chill out.", "YTA- watch an episode of Bluey. Play with your kid and let your wife play with her too.", "You are so YTA.\n\nFrom the title I came here thinking it was going to be the story of some entitled spouse getting told the truth, but no, it is an AH husband / father wrecking play time for his daughter. The response about being a queen would have been acceptable, or something along the lines of \"yes m'ladies, pizza will be served shortly\".", "I think YTA, she simply was joking and having a lot of fun. I think as adults we grow out of this style of fantasy play, and when we have kids we find that we miss it A LOT. I would also gander that you have made \u201cI\u2019m the kind statements\u201d you just might not have used that exact language, that she probably went along with. I think every girl wants to be a princess and sometimes be pampered, in a joking or serious way. I think it just caught you off guard. So unintentionally the AH?", "Yta. When i was a kid i always remembered my dad playing with me. Your kid will remember this and resent you when your kid grows up :/", "uhmm, my boyfriend calls me a princess all the time and doesnt mind me acts and talk like one (not most of the time). So I guess it boils down to how much you love your wife and you might needa fix your toxic masculinity too.  \n\nSo YTA.", "Absolutely YTA. Not only would her acting like that be normal with the kid present but childlike behavior is LITERALLY a coping mechanism for trauma cases, particularly prevalent amongst women.
