Right now, doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a positive influence. \n\nTalk to your wife, perhaps look into therapy to help you work out these feelings and thoughts; to learn to communicate better and why you are so against you and your wife playing pretend and encouraging imagination and creative thinking.
