He is a self-taught software engineer and makes pretty good money. \n\nA little over 1 year ago he married his girlfriend (28f) of 6 years, let's call her Heather. She's not a bad person but I think she's a little bit spoiled. She's the type that loves to brag about all the expensive stuff her husband bought her and their wedding was pretty extravagant. She still loves to talk about how it was the most amazing wedding she's \"ever been to\". My brother is kind of wrapped around her finger but it never really mattered until now.\n\nI met my fiancee(36m) about 4 years ago. It was a business event and he owns a decently sized and very successful company. So saying that, he's extremely wealthy. Since he grew up less-than he loves to spend his money on things him and his family could only dream about before. \n\nOne of those things is, of course, our wedding. He wants to go all out and hired a somewhat well-known wedding planner to arrange everything. Honestly, I'm pretty excited. I never dreamed of such a luxurious wedding but now that it's happening it feels like I'm living some wild dream I never even dared have. Like textbook fairytale. \n\nRecently I was at a family gathering and was hanging out in the living room with my mom and Heather doing \"girl talk\". My mom started asking me how the planning was going and when I told her about everything we were doing I could see Heather go pale and then extremely red in the face. She was quiet for the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day Adrian called me and said that Heather was extremely upset and felt like I was trying to one-up her wedding. She said I was trying to \"up stage\" her because I never expressed desire for a \"fancy\" wedding before. He asked me if we could tone it down so it doesn't exceed the budget they had for their own wedding. I laughed because honestly I couldn't believe what I was hearing and then I naturally said no. He sounded upset and hung up.\n\nA few hours later Heather calls and she starts yelling at me, repeating mostly the same stuff, saying she knew I was always jealous of her and I'm only with my fiancee because he's rich and I want to rub it in her face. That made me snap and I said \"if you're that obsessed with money maybe you should have married someone else instead of my brother, if anyone's jealous of someone it's you\", she screamed at me and started crying before hanging up.\n\nNow Adrian is angry and calling me an AH for insinuating she shouldn't have married him, and my parents think I was too harsh on her when I \"know she's always been material\" and are asking me to lower our wedding budget to appease her. I don't want to. My fiancee definitely doesn't want to. But I don't know if that makes me an AH or not?", "created_utc": 1678117361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k28vc/aita_for_having_a_better_wedding_than_my_sil/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is deeply insecure and thought that she could find security in some kind of best-wedding status. You telling her that she's obsessed with money and maybe should have married someone else instead of your brother was way below the belt. There's a difference between holding firm, and lashing out. You haven't had to deal directly with your SIL's narcissistic behavior before so you lashed out at her. It won't help you enjoy your wedding day and it was unfair to your brother.

No one really pays attention to anything else. I\u2019ve been to extravagant weddings where I had to walk up a hill to the bathroom and felt like half my night was spent navigating that walk.

And it's so ridiculous to ask you to *match their budget* that I'm doubting the veracity of this post. But your post does seem very judgmental of her and the wedding, and I'm wondering if that came through in that conversation. For example, you sound contemptuous talking about how she's \"spoiled\", \"loves to brag about the expensive stuff her husband bought her\", and \"their wedding was pretty extravagant\". But with *you*, you're so \"exited\" for the \"luxurious wedding\" that your fiance \"wants to go all out\" on. You keep describing the *same situations* yet with Heather it's an indictment of her materialism, and with you it's just lovely excitement.\n\nAnd even if you weren't judgmental of her in that conversation, your post is so scornful of her that I'm wondering if you expressed that attitude towards her \"materialistic\" wedding many times before - only to turn around and gush about having an significantly more extravagant wedding.\n\nIf this is real, I think you posted this asking for permission to have a luxurious wedding - congratulations, you have it, obviously. Like, it's ridiculous for you to tone down your wedding plans so it doesn't retroactively upstage hers, and you shouldn't, and you know that.

It never really impacted me before do when she showed me her new Choos I'd react normally like \"omg they're gorgeous!\" I don't think she's a bad person or wrong for talking about what excites her though but if this came across that way maybe I shouldn't reconsider...", "Honestly, when my mom asked I didn't really think about how Heather would feel (maybe that also makes me the AH?), I just wanted to share these amazing things we were planning when asked about it because I'm excited. I know I never really planned on having such an expensive wedding but honestly I never thought I'd marry someone that well off either. As for why I laughed it was kind of an immediate reaction it wasn't like a long laugh more like \" haha no... Just no.\"", "Why should OP have to censor herself about her wedding?\n\nHeather\u2019s reaction is because of Heather\u2019s problems.", "And that's the thing, many times you do things you don't really cared for before just to make your partner happy.\n\nI never cared if I married or not, I was satisfied with just living together. But my partner (now husband) wanted marriage when we started having kids, and since I really didn't care either way, we got married.\n\nNTA OP\n\nEdit: a word", "I never even considered the children part until now. Yikes. I hope this isn't gonna become like a while thing in the future as well.", "You mean what I said about my brother? Yeah, that wasn't my best moment so I can accept that judgement. And haha, honestly I'm not that pressed about having some luxe lifestyle. I'm aware of how privileged we are and how many people are worse off than we are. But my fiancee never had this stuff growing up and now he's like a kid in a candy shop that got told to pick as much stuff as he wants. (He gives a lot of money away to less fortunate people too) and I love him and I love seeing him excited and proud.", "This!", "Yeahhh, honestly I never considered this could be a long term behavior thing until a few of these comments and now I'm kind of dreading the future.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I 100% agree with you.\n\nGotta wonder how these people stack up against the people with the ***real*** money.\n\n\u201c he owns a decently sized and very successful company. So saying that, he's extremely wealthy\u201d\n\nLike, lady, I come from somewhere the millionaires mow the lawns of the billionaires. Literally. Someone who ***owns*** a landscaping company can easily make millions.\n\nExtremely wealthy is subjective. He could be worth a couple hundred thousand. Which isn\u2019t all that much. But if you\u2019re from lower socioeconomic class it sure is.", "Whats your damage Heather?\n\n\nEdit - apparently quoting an iconic 80s movie will get you blocked.", "Heather?", "To clarify, they didn't ask me to lower it to match theirs just to make it less obvious how well-off we are so she doesn't notice it as much.", "Possibly...Sadly I have seen this shit play out in real life with a friend's family.  Their parents absolutely doted on friend's brother and his wife.  Any time friend had something brother's wife thought was \"better\" the parents berated friend for \"flaunting\"", "Oh man...if it were me and I had the $$ I'd go ALL OUT now just to be that person. Fiance rides in on a white stallion. Full choral background and symphony. Leave on a hot air balloon. Michael Buble sings the first dance.  LMAO", "This made me laugh. \ud83d\ude02 I also think this would start WW3 in our family but otherwise I would totally do that.", "Sounds amazing. For someone who loves having money spent on her you think she\u2019d be thrilled about being given a free tropical trip!", "I dont think you deserve any flack for being a little mean to someone who was being absolutely wretched to you. \n\nJust because you could have been nicer doesnt mean you are an AH", "Who cares about how she feels? She had \"her day\" a year ago. She can't have her year, her decade, her century etc", "She knew it made her upset, But she kept on going. Regardless of that Heather is insane, there is no reason to keep hurting her. Listen, i dont get why she would even Care, and it is really Odd that it upsets her - no denying that at all. But if you can sense that someone does not handle this kind well, why would you ignore it? I know she is in her right to talk about her wedding, and have her back free. But what is the reason she would ignore her SIL? Its not mutual exclusive that Heather is an asshole, and that you dont have to Care for her regardless.", "[removed]", "Fucking hell what WIT!\n\nHeather is shit too. Hence ESH.\n\nJog on. Assholes who write diatribes about how much nicer their shit is than other people who think their money makes them better are ALL ASSHOLES.", "You miss the bit where I said ESH. Heather is an asshole too for the same reason of bragging.", "well, tbh i think holding an exorbitantly extravagant wedding is an asshole move regardless of context. but this sounds like rich people's problems to me so i don't really care. do whatever you want", "i just always have my doubts when one of these posts is like \"everyone i know is on the obviously wrong person's side\"", "Your parents are being ridiculous. Why on earth should you appease her? She is acting like a toddler.", "OP was talking to her mother - it doesnt sound like the conversation lingered much longer after Heather looked to be visibly upset so I dont think OP deserves any judgment for that.", "[removed]", "I get what you mean and I kinda agree and if my fiancee didn't give away as much money as he does I don't think I would have gone along with it. But he grew up poor and for him this is like something he saw on TV and told himself \"one day I'll have that\" so that's why I was okay with it. I'm sorry, I know how entitled it sounds.", "I used to call stuff like this fake, but with personal family drama I can 100% see this being perfectly normal for other peoples families sadly", "Yeah Well, basically we do not know that. It kinda evolves around how much Detail had to set her off, and how much time she kept Sharing Well-knowing that she Got upset about it. I know most people know what triggers friends and family members. E.g talking much about children and Babies in front of child-less relatives that badly wants kids. Not the best example But i am sure you follow :-) \n\nAll things set aside, i am not strongly judging OP. Its more like an observation", "[removed]", "At a certain point putting more money into a wedding doesn't actually increase the enjoyment of anyone present, it's just to show off how rich you are. And regardless of how you dress it up, that is basically your fiance's motivation, to demonstrate to all his friends and family \"how far he's come\" because he can afford to waste a shitton of money on a single (albeit important) party. That's why I don't feel a lot of sympathy for anyone in this story.\n\nThat said, in this specific conflict your SIL and brother are in the wrong, obviously. So again, do whatever you want, you certainly have no reason to care about what I think lol.", "[removed]", "Hmm, maybe that could be his motivation, I certainly didn't think it is. He's behaving more like a child that never had anything and can now have everything they want. (Which I've told him before he should talk to someone about and he always says he will but to let him enjoy this a little longer)\n\nAnd in terms of enjoyment, why it's as expensive is because he wanted a destination wedding and wants to pay for the flights/accomodations of those attending. \n\nThanks for your opinion either way, every opinion is valid!", "[removed]", "i'll be honest OP, you continually remembering details that happen to prove that you and your husband are actually saints who've never done anything even remotely wrong (actually he donates most of his money to charity, actually the wedding is only expensive because he's paying for everyone to attend) is just confirming my original belief that this story is fake.\n\nbut if it's real, hope you have a fun wedding!", "[removed]", "I think you're misunderstanding me a bit... He doesn't donate all of his money but having been through poverty he donates often and not necessarily small amounts. Or he helps out his extended family and friends. I only meant that in the sense of he's not greedy with his money. But it's far from donating most of it... And the wedding is definitely as expensive as it is because it's a destination wedding but I kinda felt like that was worse than a regular wedding because I know how privileged it sounds so I didn't initially mention it. But then people seem less judgey about the money than I expected so I figured I can mention it in comments...\n\nBut I don't want to convince you because it really doesn't matter, so thanks for your well-wishes!", "[removed]", "Ignore this person. You sound genuinely excited to be married to your fianc\u00e9 and the nice wedding abroad is just the icing on the cake.", "[removed]"]}
