He is a self-taught software engineer and makes pretty good money. \n\nA little over 1 year ago he married his girlfriend (28f) of 6 years, let's call her Heather. She's not a bad person but I think she's a little bit spoiled. She's the type that loves to brag about all the expensive stuff her husband bought her and their wedding was pretty extravagant. She still loves to talk about how it was the most amazing wedding she's \"ever been to\". My brother is kind of wrapped around her finger but it never really mattered until now.\n\nI met my fiancee(36m) about 4 years ago. It was a business event and he owns a decently sized and very successful company. So saying that, he's extremely wealthy. Since he grew up less-than he loves to spend his money on things him and his family could only dream about before. \n\nOne of those things is, of course, our wedding. He wants to go all out and hired a somewhat well-known wedding planner to arrange everything. Honestly, I'm pretty excited. I never dreamed of such a luxurious wedding but now that it's happening it feels like I'm living some wild dream I never even dared have. Like textbook fairytale. \n\nRecently I was at a family gathering and was hanging out in the living room with my mom and Heather doing \"girl talk\". My mom started asking me how the planning was going and when I told her about everything we were doing I could see Heather go pale and then extremely red in the face. She was quiet for the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day Adrian called me and said that Heather was extremely upset and felt like I was trying to one-up her wedding. She said I was trying to \"up stage\" her because I never expressed desire for a \"fancy\" wedding before. He asked me if we could tone it down so it doesn't exceed the budget they had for their own wedding. I laughed because honestly I couldn't believe what I was hearing and then I naturally said no. He sounded upset and hung up.\n\nA few hours later Heather calls and she starts yelling at me, repeating mostly the same stuff, saying she knew I was always jealous of her and I'm only with my fiancee because he's rich and I want to rub it in her face. That made me snap and I said \"if you're that obsessed with money maybe you should have married someone else instead of my brother, if anyone's jealous of someone it's you\", she screamed at me and started crying before hanging up.\n\nNow Adrian is angry and calling me an AH for insinuating she shouldn't have married him, and my parents think I was too harsh on her when I \"know she's always been material\" and are asking me to lower our wedding budget to appease her. I don't want to. My fiancee definitely doesn't want to. But I don't know if that makes me an AH or not?", "created_utc": 1678117361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k28vc/aita_for_having_a_better_wedding_than_my_sil/", "score": 823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you had called her a gold digger that'd be different, but you insinuated he was unworthy.", "I think they were commenting on the wrong post...? They probably were trying to respond on the AITA where the sibling was bitching about her sister not being a lesbian because now she's dating her boyfriend while the poster was whining about never being allowed to have boys sleep over in high school.", "I\u2019m just as confused as you are.", "if a conversation is happening around someone that they don\u2019t like (especially if it\u2019s not even about them), they should leave.", "I'd've laughed too at such a ludicrous request turned demand. She nuts.", "Of course you should do with your wedding what you want. But you could avoid talking about it in front of her. Of course there is also the solution to say you are In your good right to do so, because other options are insane, But now that you know that, what Will be your next move when this kind of conversation are likeley to start up again?", "She should grow up, and op's wedding is the best opportunity for a well needed reality check.", "Right?!?! \u201cShe\u2019s always been a whiny baby, so let\u2019s continue appeasing her so that behavior is guaranteed to continue.\u201d You\u2019ll be asked to take the backseat for everything if you keep giving into her tantrums.", "NTA. Bad behavior should not be appeased. It should be ignored or called out, depending on circumstances. Shame on your parents and brother for being mad at the unwitting boat rocker. \n\nHold your course . Your wedding has nothing to do with hers. Weddings are joyous celebrations to be shared whether the budget is $1,000 or 50,000.  You are having the wedding you want and it\u2019s not a competition and its too bad she is causing family discord .\n\nThe issue is how you keep your family peaceful and together in the face of her polarizing bad behavior and lack of apparent shame. Probably best you ignore her unreasonable demands and offer the true and simple observation that your wedding has nothing to do with hers and its a shame she has made it a competition.", "Exactly why wouldn't her own parents tell their son him and his wife are being rediculas", "My thoughts.. If SIL can't pull it together, she doesn't need to be there. I could see this girl trying to sabotage 100%", "Totally agree with this.  Do not engage with the Borg.", "Right? \"The wedding plans are going great, thanks! Really looking forward to having you all there\". End of story. They don't need any more information. None of their business how much things cost.\n\nIf she brings it up again, tell your SIL to kick rocks.", "I know my wedding (first of the siblings) was much cheaper \ud83d\ude01\nI had 60 guest in a free of charge parish hall. My brother had 250 guests at a expensive venue. My sister had 150 at a cheap venue.\nBut that's all I know.", "That is exactly what I was thinking!! Unless OP was discussing prices of things, which I doubt since that is tacky. I also have no clue what things cost nowadays (been married a LONG time). \\*\\*Edited to say OP NTA, don't change anything for anyone else. Have the wedding you and your fianc\u00e9 want!", "I'm sorry, but wasting money to spit her SIL would mean OP was stooping to her level.\n\nMaybe OP should start a charity and see if she can out donate her SIL.  At least then someone would actually benefit from the pettiness.", "oh damn I missed that part! :(", "That's amazing advice! I'll practice that. \n\nAnd I mentioned this in a few comments already but she \"knows\" the budget because it's a destination wedding with travel/accomodations paid for all attendees. And when I said that to my mom(after she asked) I also showed pictures of the venue of the wedding. So it's more that she can guess the budget rather than know exactly.", "That's fair advice. To be fair I don't think my husband would mind paying stuff for their kids but I don't think I should put him in that position in the first place. Maybe I need to have a sincere conversation with Heather when this blows over a bit because I really don't want this kind of thing to be a regular situation in the future.", "I don't even want to think about how she will be throughout her pregnancy if she is like this now. OP better not even think about having children! /s", "... wow I never saw it like this. Maybe you're right. I didn't used to care but maybe now that I'm upset about this (and was angry typing as well) something flipped in my head. I swear I never minded her talking about all her things, I was happy to discuss it because she was clearly excited and I think it's nice to see happy people regardless of what they're happy for. \n\nBut I admit, I'm angry about this now and maybe that's why I now used these words instead of kinder ones. Thank you so much for the effort put into your comment, it did make me realize how different I speak of her...", "How is it an asshole move?  \n\n\nThey can waste their money how they see fit, that doesn't make them an asshole for it", "That's fair! I really didn't see it that way or mean it that way, it was more to say that this stuff matters to her a lot but I think my phrasing could have been better. I really have no problem with money making people happy. We're all different so...", "this is terrible advice. you know how insane it would be to avoid talking about your wedding in front of your SIL? any time they\u2019re both visiting her mom or she\u2019s visiting her brother, she can\u2019t talk about her own wedding, lest SIL hears. . with her own mother! if it\u2019s upsetting SIL, she needs to make sure *she* isn\u2019t there for those conversations, not the other way around.", "NTA, but I do suggest you lower your wedding budget - say, by trimming two people off the guest list?", "Yep, she's like the kid in the grocery store screaming for candy. If you give in, the tantrums will never end. NTA.", "Imagine first babies and the ensuing drama", "Exactly, let's see how it goes when parents tell OP to limit their children's education because SIL can't afford to match it. Or if, God forbid, OP'S child needs medical care and parents tell her to not get the best care money can buy because SIL couldn't do the same. Now you can see how absolutely ridiculous giving into SIL is.", "How much you want to bet that Heather shows up in a white lace, floor-length cocktail dress?", "It\u2019s not wasting money. OP wanted a fancy wedding. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t hold back or try to limit yourself to make her SIL happy because nothing less than a lesser wedding than hers will make her happy.", "So she gets to go on a free vacation and has the gull to complain; wow.", "I would put your parents on an info diet too seeing as their enabling your SIL unreasonable behaviour. No wedding details to your parents either & generic answers for them going forwards too. Your Mum seemed to have no problems with your wedding until your SIL threw a tantrum. And frankly if your family - or at least you & your parents- don't get on the same page about this behaviour being unacceptable ASAP, than prepare for this behaviour to escalate. SIL already knows all she has to do is cry & throw a fit and people will adjust their behaviour rather than call her out. She probably has a mental list of people this works on. I'd assume so far the list is her marriage, her family, minimum wage workers. She's about to add her in-laws (*you & your parents*) to the list.", "NTA. I think something that's often forgotten in these discussions is that it's a wedding for two people. Just because you didn't care about a fancy fairytale wedding your whole life, doesn't mean your fiance isn't entitled to the wedding of his dreams. That could be an effective diversion too: tell her he's paying for his dream wedding, and you're not going to rain on his parade just to appease her... although there is potential of it backfiring, as it could just redirect her anger to him. Just a thought.", "Heather will always look at anything you choose to do as if you are rubbing your lifestyle in her face, and here's why: she cares. She cares about appearances and looking like she lives a luxurious lifestyle. Meanwhile you were content with whatever life you had and just happened to fall in love with someone with means.\n\nI saw this exact same situation play out with some of my friends from college: guy married a woman who cared way too much about appearances. Everything was \"look at how great our life is,\" when in actuality they were spending more money than they made trying to create this fiction. Meanwhile, his little sister fell in love with a guy from a very well off family and they threw an extravagant wedding. Neither of them cared for excess, so they quietly lived their simple life, but with the added luxury of no mortgage or car payments because they could buy everything outright. SIL was furious that she was struggling to pay her mortgage on her McMansion while these other two enjoyed their cabin by the lake mortgage free. Granted, if anyone looked at their instagrams, SIL with her extravagant lifestyle looked like \"the rich one.\"", "I\u2019ll be honest, don\u2019t have that conversation. This is your sign to be completely air tight, lip locked private about your entire life. People can only know what you tell them. Everything you and your husband do from here on will be ammo for her to gaslight and manipulate everyone around you so that you and your fianc\u00e9 feel compelled to doing what SHE wants. Don\u2019t give her a inch. She asks any questions involving money, you should respond along the lines \u201cI\u2019m sorry, is this you offering to pay? Otherwise, why do YOU need to know? Why do you feel compelled to be nosy about my life/finances?\u201d If it has nothing to do with her, don\u2019t give her information.", "No, Heather is always going to be this way. Let this be a lesson to you that you can\u2019t talk to her and you need to treat her with caution. A conversation with her will just cause you more heartache.", "Or, heaven forbid,  she has issues/can't concieve.", "Wasting your money on shit that doesn't matter is an asshole move, generally speaking", "nah, don\u2019t listen to this commenter. the difference between you and heather is she talks about wealth and material things so often, it\u2019s a defining characteristic for her and you don\u2019t. wealthy people can act very differently from each other and it\u2019s typically the ones who think they\u2019re wealthier than they are that are the ones constantly running their mouth about it.", "I\u2019m already exhausted for OP and her husband just thinking about the dumb fights SIL will try to pick.", "Op needs friend ready with bottle of red wine.", "HA this just might happen", "Lol for real. One easy way to lower the budget? Uninvite her.", "Right?! I volunteer to go in her place! I\u2019ll be the best wedding guest ever", "No it isn't.  \nIt isn't at all.  \nThat's actually insane thought process", "i mean, im sure we could call your spending asshole behavior too, since we very likely think some of the stuff you\u2019re spending money on is pointless.\n\nby your logic, anyone who spends their money anything besides rags, a mat to sleep on, a tent, bread, canned tuna, and drinkable water is an asshole.", "<raising my hand to help out>", "commenters like this are projecting. they\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t spend your money at all. actually, why don\u2019t you just give it to them? /s", "I had the big wedding (literally, it was on tv). \n\nThe fact that your SIL is jealous about this, I hate to say this, is only going to be the begining.\n\nHer identity is tied to her wedding now. To her, it was a competition....and she is feeling like she is about to lose.\n\nThere is literally nothing you can do about it except decline to discuss it with her. \n\nAvoid talking about money in general with her, and costs. Sad as it is, this is going to be an ongoing thing with her way into the future. If you have kids, she'll be competitive. If you have anything, she'll be competitive.\n\nTo you its a wedding and a chance to celebrate. To her its a competition and she is going to feel like she is losing on something tied into her identity.\n\nAs for your husband, I know where he is coming from. My family wanted a huge wedding and I wanted a big wedding. The irony was that my wife really didn't care but she wound up playing into the role. \n\nBTW, be prepared for your SIL to try to sabotage your wedding. Seriously. I.e. make a scene, try to screw with vendors, etc. Set passwords with your vendors.", "I'm honestly so grateful to have met him. He's such a pure person and I don't really understand how he stayed that way after becoming wealthy but I'm so glad he did. I hope he never changes."]}
