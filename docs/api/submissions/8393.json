Why didn't you just take the copy and give the photo back. Also, I think it's bizarre you keep putting MY mother instead of OUR mother except for one part... There's more here I can feel it.", "OMG why is this even an issue? Get some copies made, and who cares who gets the copies and who gets the original? Geez.", "YTA. You are 32, ffs.\nThe pictures were meant to be for your brother. You kept it even after you were told so. This makes you th AH.\nAnd If someone geht's a copy it's you. It is Not even from your mom's wedding to your father. It is from another live of her that you have no investment in but your brother does.\nBut I think there is more to that?\nYou want to punish someone here or are you just want to be right by all means necessary?\nIf so, congrats for the rift you bring to your family over a picture you snatched...", "In the day and age of easy scanning and printing high quality copies of photos, you could easily have more than one copy of this photo. It wasn\u2019t intended for you and whilst I can understand you wanting a copy of a photo of your mum, keeping the original makes is not right. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nAnd why should your brother have a copy and not you?! Make a copy and keep with you, both would be happy and it's the brothers parents wedding day so I would say it holds much more importance to them than you.", "Soft YTA. I don't think you meant any harm but it makes sense that the picture matters more to your brother. Take the L and make a copy.", "  NTA, nah you keep it. They\u2019re just photos, he has 3 others. And I guarantee if it\u2019s his, it\u2019s going in a box never to see the light of day. Sounds like your brother is a jerk", "NTA. What is the big deal? It\u2019s a photo. Make a million copies, give him all but one. \n\nYour brother does not have exclusive rights to your mother.", "Do you just take anything that's not bolted down too?", "Dude. Grow up. Make a copy of the picture and give the original back. You\u2019re being super selfish and entitled. You stole. Make a copy, give him the original, and apologize", "So you just decided to open an envelope that definitely didnt have your name? So you just go around opening and going through stuff thats clearly not yours?", "So you literally stole it\n\nThats what you did\n\nYou stole it from an unmarked envelope whose destination you didnt know and didnt bother to ask\n\nFor all you knew this envelope was being taken to be compiled into a professional scrapbook and without that photo the page layout would be ruined and itd be super expensive to get it readded once it was found\n\nStop taking things that dont belong to you!\n\nWhat if i leave my keys on the counter while im at your house does that make them yours because they arent clearly labeled too? YTA GIVE HIM HIS PHOTO BACK", "INFO: Did they have \\*your\\* name on them? I'm guessing not.", "You knew they weren't yours though? So why touch them all all?", "YTA and a snooping thief.    \n\nA normal person snooping would have snapped some photos of these photographs using their phone.   \n\nI could understand that \u2014 oooops!   Found something so cool and private I just had to take a pic on my phone.  \n\nBut you stole what\u2019s not meant for you.   \n\nYou\u2019d better give it back.", "It didn't have your name either \n\n(I get that you want a picture of your mom happy in her special day, but yeah, you were an asshole about it)", "Yeah, but now you know. So don't play stupid.", "They didn't have your name either, you thief.", ">They didn\u2019t have my brothers name on them\n\nWhat kind of elementary school shit is this? Are you seriously 32 years old?", "They didn't have your name on them, either.  Taking something that doesn't belong to you is straight up stealing. You can't even use ignorance as an excuse, even though you didn't know at the time they were for your brother, you do know now that they were for him.   \n\n\nGive the gd picture back, along with a sincere apology. Also  stop snooping around other people's stuff and taking things that don't belong to you.   \n\n\nYTA", "Well whatever your excuse was, since now you know they were for your brother you need to give it back. It\u2019s a picture of HIS mom when she was married to his dad and was brought for him. How would you feel if he stole a picture that your grandma meant to give you\u2026.", "Okay so return it then! You're an asshole if you keep it after all this. Your grandma brought it for your brother, not you.", "Yeah but that ain\u2019t your dad. Why in the world would you think it\u2019s for you?? Give it back! YTA. Plus, your mom made a compromise with you\u2026 it is a reasonable compromise!", "You know this is rubbish because why would an envelop have lots of items for someone else and one for you without it being Siri finally spelled out that they were to be divided.", "So by your logic everything that doesn't have a name on it is free real estate?", "\u201cIm sorry officer, i saw this bag of money left all alone and there was no name on it.  I only took it because maybe it was for me\u2026 no name on it\u201d", "You sound like a toddler.", "Doesn't matter what it was. The photo didn't belong to you, you took it without their permission and then refused to hand it over when asked. YTA", "You're a dirty thief who deserves everything bad coming to her. Give it the fuck back. YTA", "\"Grandma dropped off some pictures for my brother. I then took one of my brother's pictures before he got them. I took it because I want it. AITA?\"\n\nYES.", "The word brat had me checking the ages because I assumed OP was like... early to mid teens... Unfortunately not.", "It\u2019s a pic of just her mom in her wedding dress. Not saying she should\u2019ve taken it, just clarifying", "Your grandmother brought the pictures for your brother. Make a good copy and when you give him the original, apologize because YTA."]}
