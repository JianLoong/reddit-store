Doesn't sound like it.  There's also 18 and 22 years between you so they were adults when you were born so likely didn't have much to do with you.\n\nHow about your mom keep the original and make copies for both of you?  It is a photo of her.  I would hope grandma had copies anyway because these photos are of her daughter and she was giving the photos to  former son in law that she doesn't seem to be in contact with as I'm assuming the photos were going to him via his sons.\n\nAnd the photos weren't even for your brother but for your mothers ex husband.  It sounds like your grandmother is okay with him if she's thinking of him and giving him these photos.\n\nI feel your brothers reaction is over the top but there is a lot of animosity between the two of you.  I also feel that there is actually a lot more to the story and your brother feels very strongly about the way you were brought up v's the way he was brought up even if some of that is that your mother was probably 20 when he was born but 40 when you were born so in a very different position in life.  Or how differently you have all been treated.  At the same time I can see why you would want the photo.  But a copy is fine.  You don't need the original.\n\nI suspect you may need to take a long hard look at yourself and how you treat your brother and what your expectations are and exactly what the relationship is between the two of you.", "Nta it's one picture of several if it was the only picture you would be the ah", "NTA Why should he have the original?

I see no other reason to be so selfish that you won't accept the copy.", "Yes, but the photo was taken on the day your mom married your brother\u2019s dad.

I honestly don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t just agree to keeping a copy to avoid this drama.", "NTA\u2014 however, do you think this is worth causing a rift between you & your brother? You maybe should think about just getting a super-high quality copy so you have a near original so that your brother can stfu & move on if this picture is that important to him. Unless you don\u2019t have a decent relationship with him anyway, then just keep the picture except if your grandma insists you give it back.", "The pictures were brought to Mom\u2019s & belong to Mom first. They are from her wedding day. She didn\u2019t have to give them to any of her kids. Both her children want the picture so OP got the original & Mom offered to make a copy for brother. Who cares who has the original or who has the copy.  No one stole anything.", "Grandma originally brought the pictures for OP\u2019s brother. Since the original intent was for the brother to have the originals OP should take the copy", "You\u2019re making up a whole story that doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s in the post. OP\u2019s grandmother told her grandson the she brought the pictures for him. Why is that not registering for you? The pictures belong to OP\u2019s grandmother. She is the one who had them in her possession for all these years. Just because OP\u2019s mom is in the pictures doesn\u2019t mean they belong to her", "I don't see why that shouldn't happen.", "Apparently I am the only one seeing that Mom has 3 kids & they all want the same picture of their Mother. When it was taken, how it was taken, who possessed it first doesn\u2019t matter because the problem is easily solved. Sorry but this is just a matter of finders keepers. If it was a picture of mom at her graduation or when she was little it would all be the same ... a nice picture of their Mother before she had children. Maybe OP should call grandma & see what she thinks? Because sounds like Mom doesn\u2019t have a problem with which kid gets the original picture.", "Maybe you\u2019re missing the fact that OP\u2019s mom has three kids with two different men. This picture was taken when OP\u2019s mom married her first husband (her brothers\u2019 father) more than 20 years before OP was born. OP\u2019s mom\u2019s first marriage is a part of her brother\u2019s family history, not OP\u2019s. To OP this is simply a picture of her mom in a wedding dress. To her brother, it\u2019s a picture from his parents\u2019 wedding day. Do you see the sentimental difference?", "Finders keepers!?!? That\u2019s the excuse my 8 year old students try to use when they want to keep one of their classmates belongings after they find them around the classroom. \n\nTaking something that belongs to something else and refusing to return it is stealing. Finding it somewhere (in this case in a closed envelope where her grandmother left them) does not magically make the possession not theirs.", "Excuse me? Ops mother's personal history is not a part of ops family history? How do you figure? There's no excuse for this drama on either end, just get some copies made for everyone who wants one and be done with it.", "The short answer to your question is not really. Her mom's first husband wasn't her dad or even her step dad. She doesn't have a direct connection to this part of her mom's history. If OP's mother wore a wedding dress when she married her father, OP wouldn't want this picture. The only reason she wants it is because she feels cheated and this is the only way she can have a picture of her mom in a wedding dress. Her attitude towards this issue is one of  entitlement, not sentiment."]}
