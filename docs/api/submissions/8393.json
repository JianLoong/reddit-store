The mom is okay with OP having the picture, & is also cool with making a copy. To me both OP & the sibling suck, bc if it's just about being able to have a photo of the mom on that day, no one would've objected to a copy. It seems they both objected to getting a copy, so now this picture of someone they both love, is some weird power play.", "Yes, but why isn\u2019t OP willing to take the copy?  None of the pictures were intended for her after all.", "Fair enough, I misread that. Either way, make a freaking copy and deal.", "It's not the mother's picture though.

Their mother is irrelevant.", "But that wasn't specified to OP;\n\nSo to use your hotdog analogy: If someone drops off a basket of hotdogs on the table in front of me and walks away without a word about them, I'd assume it was okay for me to have one.

Honestly I think Mom should get first dibs on the original, especially at this point, and *all* of the kids (including Brother#2) should get copies.", "But it is a picture of the Mom from Mom's wedding. If Mom had no problem with OP taking it I don't see the issue.", "Never? Brother offered to let her make a copy in the OP.", "I'm not saying she's necessarily at fault for taking without asking, but when it became clear that they were meant for someone, she should have behaved differently.
