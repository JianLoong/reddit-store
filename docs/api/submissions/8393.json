Do you always snoop through other people belongings and steal what you like? YTA. Give the original back and take the copy. It\u2019s the same dang picture, sticky fingers", "And now you know that your grandma brought it for your brother. So why did you make this post when you know you stole something that wasn\u2019t meant for you?", "Plead ignorance for the initial taking all you want, but you know NOW who the pictures were intended for, and you\u2019re refusing to give up the original. YTA.\n\nThe appropriate response is \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know, here it is. Can I please have a copy?\u201d while handing it over. Not \u201cOh I didn\u2019t know so I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d", "Whose kitchen was this in?", "No one believes this garbage excuse.", "If there was no name on it why would you assume it's for you?", "Just because there was no name on it doesn't mean you open it!!! Not only did you open it, YOU STOLE from it.\n\nSo according to you this is ok to do! YTA", "\u2026 you saw an envelope and opened it because \u201cmaybe it was for me?\u201d Maybe you should have asked \u201chey, who\u2019s envelope is this?\u201d A snoop AND a thief.", "So you're nosey as well as entitled.  You should have asked before taking something that you didn't know who it belonged to.  \n\nIf you wanted a copy that would have been fine, but to not give them over when you found out is disgusting.", "But they weren\u2019t for you \ud83e\udd28\n\nYou stole that photo. Your grandmother ment to give it to your brother. It is your grandmother her decision. Give that photo back to your brother.", "And now you know. Give it back.", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t have my brother\u2019s name on them.\u201d  \n\nAre you twelve? You KNOW they were meant for your brother. Stop stealing.", "I just realised you're 32, not 2. You're not playing finders keepers here. If you've been told the envelope wasn't for you, what part of \"it. wasn't. for. you.\" did you not understand? \n\nYou weren't the intended recipient, do the right thing and return them to your brother. You should take a copy for your own viewing but I don't see why you so desperately need to have the originals. The age of the photos collectively mean more to your brother than it does to you.", "so will it be ok for your brother to take any mementos you have of your mother? if she leaves you any jewelry, clothes, letters, pictures, he can just grab what he wants because she\u2019s his mother too right? \n\nthe picture was in possession of your grandmother. she gave it to him. it\u2019s his property. just because you stole it does not make their transaction any less valid. take the copy and return the original. \n\nyou guys share the contents of the photo not the actual ownership of it.", "It was a photo of your mother...but it was a photo of her married to his father which has more significance than you wanting a photo of your mother in a wedding dress married to another man who is not your father...", "But the photo was not just as much yours as it is his.\n\nIt was not for you. End of story.", "Yes she\u2019s your mom, but those are not your photos. They weren\u2019t given to you. You can easily make a copy and give the original back to its owner. Being related to the subject of the photo does not give you rights to take it when it\u2019s not yours.", "By that definition, your mom has more rights to the picture than you do, because it's a picture of HER, and she says it should go to your brother.", "So what? The photos were given to your brother, not to you. The photo is of your mother\u2019s marriage to YOUR BROTHER\u2019s father, not yours. No harm in you having a copy, but this is not your photo.", "Her mother proposed getting a copy made for OP, so that insinuates strongly that mother believes the photo PROMISED TO HIM BY HIS GRANDMOTHER, should go to the brother. OP is most definitely an AH.", "It\u2019s only OK for her to have it if it was GIVEN to her. It was not. Her grandmother brought it over for her brother. She swiped it. OP needs to give it back.", "And if she'd asked for a copy of the photo, then no problem at all", "Yes, the COPY of the photo that the mother proposed for OP.", "The mom is also her brother\u2019s mom, so they have equal claim in that regard. It\u2019s a picture of the mom on her wedding day to the brother\u2019s dad and not to OP\u2019s dad, so brother has a stronger claim there. And OP didn\u2019t ask or discuss it with anyone when she knew grandma intended it for the brother. She just took it. So overall I\u2019d say the brother should have it and OP gets a copy. She still comes out ahead of where she was at the beginning when she had no photo at all\n\nOP should get a photo of her mom on the day she and OP\u2019s dad were married even if it wasn\u2019t a big fancy dress. Is the marriage or the dress most important?", "It's also a picture of his mother, right?  They are half siblings through their mom?", "Make a copy and give him the original if you want a picture of your mother in her wedding dress and give the original to your bother. And stop snooping stealing. YTA", "None of them belonged to you. What is your problem? Get a copy made and move on with your life. YTA.", "You didn\u2019t have the right to take any, honestly. YTA.", "TBH it\u2019s not clear she does really think of it as of her mother on her special day, given how committed she seems to be to depriving her brother of the picture. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to assert ownership of her mother, via the picture.", "\u201cMy mom offered to make him a copy and he said that I should have the copy and he have the original. He ended up leaving after telling me I was being an asshole about it.\u201d\n\nAnd apparently OP refused that option, because it sounds like her half-brother agreed as long as he got the original, and OP doesn\u2019t say what her reaction was other than \u201cthen he left.\u201d I don\u2019t understand how OP could possibly think she was entitled to the original, nor why she cared so much about having the original over a copy.", "Where does it say the brother asked for them? It seemed like just a nice gesture on the part of the grandmother. Then she saw them and the mother said she could have it.", "Bro her mom saw her take it and didn't say shit. So she had every reason to continue on", "Seems to still live with parents though? Since she\u2019s acting like those pictures, brought to her mother\u2019s place, were hers for the taking. If she doesn\u2019t still live there then it\u2019s even worse.\n\nIf her attitude towards things in that house is \u201canything I want is mine if it\u2019s unlabelled\u201d, then she needs to be kicked out / denied independent access.", "That\u2019s like saying it\u2019s okay for someone to steal someone else\u2019s tv because they have two. It\u2019s still wrong", "It says in the main post that he came over asking about them and that grandma had told him she was bringing them round for him. So either she specifically wanted him to have the photos, or he asked for them specifically. In either case it doesn't seem random.", "This is not about the mom. This is about her taking something that belongs to someone else who is not there. You don't just take stuff. You ask first."]}
