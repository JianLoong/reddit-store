Honestly, they don't work that well, but they're better than nothing.\n\nOne other option is after showering to put some baby rash cream plus a bit of cream that contains silver.

You could find a kind way to bring it to her attention and there is many options for antiperspirants now a days.

Did she grow up in a third world country or in an alternative lifestyle/ cult or something like that to not understand what antiperspirant is?", "I use an all-natural deodorant cream that you only need to apply every couple of days after the initial period where you should use it daily. It has no antiperspirant function and no perfume. What it does is neutralising the bacteria that causes smell. I have used it for over a year now and asked my brutally honest friends for smell evaluation regularly to be sure. It works amazingly well.\n\nYou could suggest that to your mum in an empathetic way. You could start using it yourself and tell her about it and see if she gets curious about a healthy method to control bacteria overgrowth. If not, there's really nothing you can do. It's her choice and she is an adult woman, you'll have to accept it.", "Does no one in the family use soap when having a shower?\n\nAnti perspirents aren't exactly a healthy thing to use. Because they block your sweat pores. Regular deodorant is fine because it's effectively just perfume.\n\nBut if the body odour is to that extreme, then there may be some underlying health issues", "YWBTA\n\nHonestly, I think you have done enough and it's clear your mom doesn't care about smelling nice so making her do something forcefully even tho that's good for her is not going to work out and you will be perceived as the asshole from atleast your mother's perspective if not by everyone.

All that does is mask the fact you should've taken a shower. Your mom's actually right. If you smell you change your clothes and take a shower (preferably you do so before you start smelling). If you change your clothes frequently, shower at least 3 times a week, are not obese, and not living in the Sub-Sahara desert you can attain basic hygiene without using deodorant.  \n\n\nbut you're NTA.

The fact that you had to learn personal hygiene from friends is just no ok! Does she have a partner?", "If she has issue with deodorant try suggesting talcum powder. My mom is in severe depression and doesn't take bath daily and can go months without taking shower and brushing her teeth. So the smell is unbearable. So talcum powder is major solution for her. She doesn't like using deodrant. Although I am an advocate of daily bath and can't stand her.", "You can smell your family's body odor far faster than anyone else's.  Its evolution's way of saying, you are too closely related for your MCH class protiens to have genetic diversity.  And deodorant doesnt really do much, and sometimes makes it worse. Maybe she has been depressed and not self caring enough.  Try making your mum feel good enough about herself, rather than putting her down..  If she is nearing menopause, then she might be suffering hyperhydrosis, and have extra sensitivity to irritants, which will only make her more irritable if she suffers rashes and itching and burning... So yeah, bit assholeish imo, but more from lack of compassion.", "Sweat doesn't smell. It's the bacteria that builds up on our skin in the armpits and other areas that feeds on the sweat that then causes the not so nice odours. A simple fresh wipe over the dodgy areas prevents the need for deodorant if she has an aversion to them. A type of staphylococcus I believe.", "NTA get her some Lume. It's all natural.

Everyone in my family needs to use deodorant immediately after showering otherwise we\u2019re hopping back in for another round 30 mins- 1 hr later.", "Agree with you that we don\u2019t need deodorant but being obese has nothing to do with it.

I think body chemistry could also play a factor.", "For the same reason my grandfather still dresses like it's 1940, and why some people have thick accents after having been in US since their 20s, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) I'm assuming/guessing it's something to do with the way the brain develops.\n\nI wish you luck, was trying to think what I would do in this situation and other than bugging her about it until she understands I can't think of any good solution apart from getting a spray bottle and hosing her down", "It definitely sounds like some sort of health issue and I would definitely see a doctor, because it could be indicative of something more serious\n\nI'm going to reserve judgement because, potentially, if it is something inherent in your mum's family, she may not realise that there is a bad odour.", "Are you eating healthy and drink enough WATER? \nA healthy clean person isnt supposed to smell after 1 hour.", "but probably those lovely smelling overweight people shower more than 3 times a week, bc sweating is linked to body weight", "Obese people tend to sweat more, which means you have to shower more often, which is a pain", "Could be bad diet too. \nYou are what you eat. And If you eat like shit, you look and smell like it too.", "No, it doesn't. Stop diagnosing people. People have natural odors. Some smell quickly, and some people dont. Having odor alone for a whole family isn't a sign of a health issue.", "Depends, I have the same thing. I just have overactive hormones, can't do anything about it (seen like 8 doctors over the last 12 years). Only thing that really helps is eating extremely low-carb, and since I used to have an eating disorder I'm not allowed to do that, so I just have to shower daily and use enough deodorant. A little hand alcohol also works in a pinch since it kills bacteria, but that's horrible for the skin.", "Unless it's the middle of the summer and you live in a high humidity area. Like Britain in the middle of summer when it's been raining.\n\nSaying that, I live in those conditions, and although I sweat a ton, I don't stink even after gym in those conditions.\n\nDrinking water is key, alongside a healthy, non greasy diet.", "So, the point is still that people with good hygiene smell good and those without don\u2019t.", "Exactly. Sweat doesn\u2019t have to smell.", "Its kind of weird, it sounds like you are disagreeing with me, but thats exactly what I Said.", "And why do it get downvotes, not that I care but I am surpised.
