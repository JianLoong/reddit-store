It's about not bogging down society in a sea of unecesaary requirements. \n\nSame principle exactly would apply for non-profit situations. I could take a school and build it with 1 in every 4 bathroom stalls being accessible, which is completely adequate. Or I could make every stall accessible, pushing up the size of the washrooms and losing a classroom space. Hence making the school serve 10% fewer kids, for no real meaningful gain given that the fraction of kids needing the accessible stalls is usually well under 25% (and if it's in a community where that's not true, sure, build more accessible stalls).\n\nThis would be a bad plan, and has nothing to do with \"profits\". \n\nIt just does NOT make sense to take things to the extreme of \"everything must be accessible! Unlimited  adaptions to the differently abled!\"\n\nEverything costs resources, and at a certain point you are unfairly reducing the services available to society as a whole in order to cater to a small fraction.by spending vast amounts of resources to make *everything* accessible.\n\n**Reasonable** accomodation, not total accomodation."]}
