Like the concept that the stall for handicapped people needs to be free at all times, because disabled people apparently can't wait a few minutes until it's free like the rest of us? Of course some people have issues that mean that they might need a bathroom more urgently but such an emergency can happen to anyone and those stalls are specifically for people who have mobility problems (meaning people who can't use the smaller stalls, you can be disabled but still be capable of using the regular restrooms).\n\nIf it's a crowded bathroom, everyone has to wait and stand in line. I just can't see why it should be such a problem to have to wait a bit for a bathroom to be free, other people have to do that too. Sure you can get pissed off if the person wasn't disabled because having a handicap is hard enough as it is, but you clearly had mobility issues and your reason was very apparent. NTA", "NTA.

You had every right to use that bathroom especially considering your current situation. They\u2019re handicapped accessible but anyone can use them. Part of using a public bathroom is that occasionally you might have to wait a few minutes if there\u2019s someone else in the bathroom that doesn\u2019t change because it\u2019s the bigger stall.

Yes sometimes it can be frustrating to have to wait for a toilet to be free, but even if you walked out without any obvious disabilities I wouldn\u2019t judge, because who knows what you might be struggling with.

I need the GSA pace to maneuver till I was off crutches I was disabled. She was just a overly entitled AH", "NTA entitled parents are everywhere. The stalls, as per a previous post, are not for exclusive wheelchair users use only. They are for people who are handicapped - temporarily or permenantly.

I recently had bunion surgery and I didn't leave my house, except to go to the doctor, for about 8 weeks. Maneuvering with crutches and a heavy cast is no joke. Especially in the toilet.

Handicapped stalls are not the same as handicapped parking spaces. They are not exclusive for handicapped people.\n\nAble bodied people can use them too, it's just general social etiquette to use a normal stall before a handicapped stall.\n\nIn your case, you could benefit greatly by using the handicapped stall given your condition and its perfectly acceptable for you to have a preference for the handicapped stall.", "NTA\n\nFirst, handicap bathrooms can be used by anyone with not in use. \n\nSecond, you were handicapped, you were not fully capable, you struggle getting up and down for basic bodily functions. \n\nThird, not all handicaps are outwardly visible to others and you don't owe them a justification or explanation. E.g. someone with an Ostomy bag. It may appear as anyone else walking around perfectly fine but still have a medical issue. It's none else's business! They aren't owed anything. \n\nNo disability trumps another, it's not a contest of who is MORE disabled. \n\nFinally, if another wheelchair user had been using the stall, the mother shouldn't have had anything else to say as they'd be in the same position as their daughter.

The only A in this situation is the mom.", "Dude I had a huge argument about this with a friend recently who swore up and down that a handicapped stall had to remain vacated for only the handicapped, because he expected me to hold my poo until the guy who just had gone in were done.", "This a million times", "One time I took my 5 year old nephew to the disabled stall in a mall bathroom. He uses a power wheelchair.\n\nSomeone stated banging on the door of the stall, so I said that we would be out as soon as we could. The banging stopped, but the woman stated talking to someone, saying stuff like, \u201cPeople are so inconsiderate,\u201d \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be using the handicapped stall,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear, you just need to hold it even longer.\u201d\n\nThen she addressed me, \u201cYou need to hurry up, I have a child out here!\u201d To which my nephew, bless his little evil heart, called out, \u201cAnd Aunty has a child in here!\u201d There was a moment of silence, and then the commenst to the other kid started up again.\n\nWe finished up, and opened the door. The woman\u2019s jaw dropped. I guess she didn\u2019t expect to see a person with a disability emerge from the disabled stall?\n\nNo apology or anything, though. And there were tons of empty stalls. She made that little kid wait for nothing."]}
