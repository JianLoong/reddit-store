I've gotten into a number of arguments with people not believing that I am disabled. I need the higher toilet and grab bars in order to stand up! Some public toilets are so low to the ground and trying to get off them hurts like a sommbitch. \n\nAs long as you aren't camping out in the accessible stall, who cares who uses it!", "NTA\n\nWe just had a discussion about this sort of issue here on AITA yesterday.  A disability doesn\u2019t need to be permanent.  Also many of these stalls now are equipped with diaper changing tables.  They\u2019re meant to accommodate anyone.  And people in wheelchairs can wait in line same as anyone else.  The stall will still be there when it\u2019s their turn.  \n\nAlso as someone with an inflammatory condition of the joints that\u2019s not exactly RA but another part of a spectrum of autoimmune disorder, I can tell you some of us need those grab bars when we can get them.   But you wouldn\u2019t know it to look at us.", "NTA.  Accessible bathroom stalls should be offered first to disabled folks, but they are not like parking spaces, and they are not reserved.  Abled bodied people can use them.  \n\n\nSecondly, not all disabilities are permanent, but that doesn't make anyone less deserving of having access to necessities.  You needed an accessible stall and you used it appropriately.  This woman is an ENORMOUS asshole for harassing you.", "NTA. You were using crutches to help you get around cause you had foot surgery. At the time it happened you were handicapped and would have had even more trouble using the non-handicap bathroom", "NTA  That stall is for you too!  Literally anyone can use any stall in a public bathroom.  This woman thinks she's entitled.", "NTA. Anyone can use that stall and you ate temporarily handicapped and needed it. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. The stall is handicapped not wheelchair only. (I have to use them bc of repeated knee surgeries. I would have yelled back at the beyotch.)", "NTA.  I\u2019m a wheelchair user and understand that there are other kinds of disabilities that require use of the handicapped stall.  Being on crutches definitely counts.", "NTA. At that moment in time, you were disabled. You used the stall made for you.", "*\"As I was in the stall I heard someone come in the bathroom and huff that the handicap stall was in use.\"*\n\nShe was huffing and puffing BEFORE she knew who was in there.\n\nIt could have been you, someone in a wheelchair or an able bodied person, it didn\u2019t matter who was in there.\n\nA handicapped stall is NOT exclusively for people with a disability, They are for everyone to use if it's needed.\n\nAnd **YOU** need it at the moment.\n\nShe may have had a rough day and took it out on you or she is just an entitled woman.\n\nEither way, NTA", "NTA.  You are fine.", "NTA\n\nYou needed the railing. She's the AH for assuming you were fine and getting huffy about waiting a few minutes. \n\nPeople need to straight stop assuming other people's capabilities, and considering you are in a cast, she's not even good at that cause most people would assume you have a need", "NTA \n\nThe mom was rude.

There is no fine involved.\n\nAnyone can use an accessible stall.\n\nThis issue comes up frequently. \n\nI am part of the disability community. A pet peeve of mine is that some people think that they are entitled to accessible  restroom stalls because they are wheelchair users. That accessible  stalls are reserved for wheelchair users. That they should remain empty until a wheelchair user arrives to use them. This is untrue.", "So very NTA.", "If it was a wheelchair-only stall you would have been at fault. If it's a general disabled/accessible toilet you were entirely fine to use it. NTA.", "NTA... that bathroom stall was there for you too. That lady was wrong to act like that.", "NTA - the stalls are handicap access, not handicap reserved and why does her child's handicap outrank yours?\n\nShe was just being entitled.", "NTA. First of all the crutches definitely qualify you to use the stall. Second of all, the larger stalls are handicapped accessible, not handicapped reserved. There was a line for the bathroom. Her son can wait in line like anyone else would do.", "NTA a handicapped stall is handicapped accessible not handicapped exclusive.", "NTA.  Handicapped stalls are meant to be used by other disabled and non-disabled people. You have a foot surgery that required you to have a taller toilet, and the grab rails to raise and lower yourself.

Don't let other people who don't understand the laws or the rights of people bully you into something that isn't right.", "NTA - you weren\u2019t using it because you just didn\u2019t want to use the others. You had a need. Don\u2019t let anyone else shame you for it.", "NTA, The handicap bathroom stall is not equivalent to handicap parking. You do not need an excuse for using it as long as you were not deliberately preventing someone else who needed it from using it. That kid can wait, and did. Mom's the AH.", "NTA. From someone who has a spent a large amount of their life in a wheelchair or with another medical device where I can only use handicap. You were handicapped. You were their first. You weren't doing something weird like drawing on the walls and wasting time. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA I have no obvious disabilities but I have busted some bones and some days its swollen and painful so getting up easily is an issue and I opt for the stall with a bar. My mom shuffles around without her cane most days but she cannot go from sitting to standing without an assist so she also doesn't look like someone who needs it but I assure you, she does. This lady just wants to have a contest of disabilities and is setting her child up to feel entitled because of it.", "NTA, also a lot of times the changing tables for babies and mothers are in the handicap stall. Is she gonna yell at a mother for utilizing the stall as it was meant to be used?", "NTA, whether you're temporarily \"handicapped\" or not. \n\nThe handicapped stall is designed to be larger than other stalls to provide more room to maneuver a wheelchair, and hand rails/a higher toilet for easier access. It's not exclusively RESERVED for handicapped people. \n\nIf their handicap is so bad that they need IMMEDIATE access to a stall, maybe they should be wearing a diaper. \n\nI may be the asshole for saying this, but it's something I feel strongly about. I'm on the chonkier side, and I prefer using the handicapped stall if it's available. If there's multiple stalls and the person behind me is in a wheelchair, I'm not going to be a jerk and take it, but if no one else is in the bathroom and it's open, it's mine.", "This is BS. Handicapped stalls are not specifically reserved for those who use a wheelchair. I don't promote violence, but smacking the mother in the head with your crutch might possibly have been warranted in this specific instance.", "In the event this ever happens again, you just respond with \"the ACCESSIBLE stall is not permit required like the parking spot. I am not required to disclose my medical information to satisfy your demands. Bugger off these floors are slippery. \"", "NTA - even if you weren't handicapped, if other stalls are full, you have the right to use the handicap stall.", "NTA Those stalls are accessible, not reserved, for the handicapped.", "You are temporarily disabled and it\u2019s totally appropriate to use the stall that accommodates that best.", "NTA, handicapped stralls are not parking spaces. Everyone can wait 5 minutes versus hours that come with parking spaces.", "NTA. You\u2019re temporarily disabled. The stall was designed to provide accessibility for people with disabilities not as a personal bathroom for her child. Also, the point of having a handicap bathroom is having a bathroom that is accessible to people with disabilities not to guarantee that they never have to wait to use the restroom like anyone else would have had you been occupying the regular stall. The mom was out of line. It\u2019s especially frustrating because she likely amped it up more and more when she realized you weren\u2019t going to stand up for yourself, some people are shitty like that.", "NTA.  Ive had knee replacement and for a while without crutches or a walker I used the handicap stall because the toilet is normally taller and there is a handle if you need help up.  No one looking at me would have known why but it isn't any of their business anyway.", "Nta. You needed the accommodations in that stall.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA, what the fuck, handicapped doesn't mean wheelchair only. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nYou are using clutches so you are fine.\nHonestly, if I have to do number 2, I will use any stall.", "NTA", "NTA. First of all, wheelchair accessible bathrooms are not exclusively for the use of people in wheelchairs. Anyone can use them at any time. If someone in a wheelchair or with another disability requires them, they should get priority, since the other stalls are not an option for them. This woman sounds like a bit of a diva, and I would forget her.", "NTA- handicapped able bathrooms are not handicapped reserved. And you 100% needed the railing/ space. She\u2019s just some entitled mom who has used her child\u2019s identity as a shield / excuse. I feel for you and her poor kid!", "I have arthritic knees. Some days I have no issues and some days it's very hard for me to sit & stand without support. On days like that I would absolutely use the handicapped stall and good luck to whoever wants to \"have a discussion\" about it with me.\n\nNTA in any way, shape or form.", "NTA. Small stalls are not accommodating to anyone outside the \u201cnorm\u201d. You needed the stall just as badly as her daughter. That woman was TA in this instance.", "NTA one medical condition doesn't Trump another.  Handicapped stalls Is for surgery and aiding in balance just as much as it is for a wheelchair.  You had a non weight bearing surgery and can't use your foot or you'll jeopardize your healing process.", "NTA. You were perfectly in your right to use the bathroom.", "NTA there are all sorts of reasons to use a disabled toilet and yours is as valid as anyone else's.  It's nit even as if your reason wasn't visible.  Honestly I fo t fet people who think disabled means never needing to weight or that one sort of disability is more valid than another. I am a disabled person saying this", "NTA. On crutches, in a cast ARE handicapped! Your disability may be only temporary, but it is real for now and you ARE quite right to use the handicapped stall with the size and grab bars you need. \n\nThat the mother yelled is ridiculous.", "NTA. At the time you were using the stall you needed it and it was designed for someone like you.\n\nAs someone with an invisible disability, I have hip issues among other things but they pop out of place from multiple pregnancies and sometimes I cannot get off of the toilet without assistance. I almost always use a handicap stall because I need the bars and I never know when I\u2019m going to get stuck. I also have a disabled child and lots of time the diaper station is in the handicap stall. \n\nNo one should be yelling at anyone about what stall they use, or spot they park in because this happens with disabled parking spots all of the time too. It\u2019s first come first serve, it doesn\u2019t go by level of disability.", "Exactly. Where I live a lot of changing stations for babies are in the handicapped bathrooms. So I use it all the time with my baby just as other parents. OP, You are handicapped at that moment so you have every right to use it. If there were 10 people in wheelchairs she also had to get in line. But then she would probably yell to others that her child is a child and need to go first. You can\u2019t win with these kind of people. I always tell myself karma will come for them.", "Handicap accessible stalls are not for the exclusive use of disabled persons either. They are just marked so that disabled persons know which are considered \u201caccessible\u201d.
