You needed the handicapped stall as evidenced by your struggle to manouevre yourself around. Some people are just assholes, you weren't in this scenario.", "NTA\n\nThat stall was literally designed for people in your situation. Whether permanent or temporary you needed it in that moment! \n\nDon\u2019t let one entitled mums behaviour get you down. You had every right to use it and she needs to learn that her child is not the only handicapped person in the universe!", "NTA. You were in crutches and a cast, so you can't exactly fit into normal sized cubicles. That woman was the selfish one who needs to learn some empathy", "Nta-you are temporarily handicapped.

They issue them to people who are permanently handicapped and they have ones they issue to people who are temporarily handicapped too, like with a broken leg or something. That\u2019s you right now, temporarily handicapped. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. You were there first, and you are technically handicapped. She's the asshole.", "I can't fathom why a handicapped person can't wait for the stall like the rest of us. Like the concept that the stall for handicapped people needs to be free at all times, because disabled people apparently can't wait a few minutes until it's free like the rest of us? Of course some people have issues that mean that they might need a bathroom more urgently but such an emergency can happen to anyone and those stalls are specifically for people who have mobility problems (meaning people who can't use the smaller stalls, you can be disabled but still be capable of using the regular restrooms).\n\nIf it's a crowded bathroom, everyone has to wait and stand in line. I just can't see why it should be such a problem to have to wait a bit for a bathroom to be free, other people have to do that too. Sure you can get pissed off if the person wasn't disabled because having a handicap is hard enough as it is, but you clearly had mobility issues and your reason was very apparent. NTA", "NTA.

You were in legitimate need of it.", "The stalls are for everyone, not exclusively for handicap use.  They just have features to make it better for handicapped users.  If I walk in needing to take a dump, and the handicap stall is the only one empty, damn straight I\u2019m going to use it.  Being handicapped doesn\u2019t move someone to the head of the line, they have to wait their turn like everyone.  NTA.", "NTA. You had every right to use that bathroom especially considering your current situation. They\u2019re handicapped accessible but anyone can use them. Part of using a public bathroom is that occasionally you might have to wait a few minutes if there\u2019s someone else in the bathroom that doesn\u2019t change because it\u2019s the bigger stall. I have damaged cartilage in my knee and occasionally use the stall because I can use the bar to help pull myself up but have occasionally gotten cussed out for using it because I\u2019m young and seem to be in shape.", "NTA. You were handicapped", "NTA\n\nWith the surgery & crutches you were allowed to you use the handicapped stall too because it was easier for you to maneuver with crutches. She was a jerk.", "NTA, you\u2019re temporarily handicapped it\u2019s for you to use. Also people with invisible disabilities might need to use the stall to are they now not allowed? I think it\u2019s really entitled to just assume without knowing someone wether they\u2019re disabled enough to use the stall.", "N T A \n\nYou're entitled to use it if you're on crutches.  \n\nWow that female needs a reality check! there are no degrees of disability when it comes to a public bathroom.  Able bodied people are perfectly entitled to use those stalls too if there is no one else with a pressing need!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
