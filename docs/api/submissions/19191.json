It might not be a big lie, but still, lying about something for years and getting married is not a nice thing to do. I can perfectly imagine her being upset about that. She has celebrated a ton of birthdays with you, including 'special' ones like your 30th, and you never decided to come clean? That would be a red flag for me, who knows what else you might be hiding.\n\nAlso, how do you manage to actually achieve that? I fill in my wife's birthday on tons of forms, I see her passport and driving license, it sounds cumbersome to keep hiding that?", "YTA. If you can lie to her for years about something as insignificant as your age what else would you lie about? It\u2019s not a matter about the AGE as such, but more so that you broke her trust.", "YTA how in the world did you forget to tell her your real age for 15 years??? I would be questioning everything if you were my husband. If you weren\u2019t honest about something so silly as 1 year difference in your age, what other truths are waiting to rear their ugly heads? \n\nNo matter your intentions, you have now planted a seed of doubt that will threaten the entire fabric of your relationship. I honestly hope this is a fake AITA.", "Info: how did yur birthdays go? Was she all \u201c happy 30th birthday babe!\u201d And it was actually your 29th and you never corrected her? And we\u2019re ALL your birthdays like this!?! \n\nHow did this NEVER come up before? \n\nAnd if it did, WHY would you lie? \n\nI need more info to make a vote\u2026\u2026but I\u2019m leaning towards YTA", "YTA you lied for YEARS", "That\u2019s a long time to mislead your wife. How has it never come up?", "YTA for getting to this age without correcting the record.\n\nBut HOW? How has it not come up?", "You've been lying to her for 13-14 years.  Was she supposed to just laugh and let it go? YTA", "If you lied about that one year difference for at least 10 years it means you\u2019ve made it that your wife never heard you give your date of birth out loud, never seen your ID in person and made sure no one else brought it up.\n\nNow I have crappy health so might be skewed but any time I have called a medical professional or been in a hospital DOB is one of the first security questions so it comes up quite often. It\u2019s also pretty fucking crucial for **your next of kin** to know. I have also read out my date of birth or my partner has every single time we pick up a prescription for each other, book an Air bnb, write it down on a form for credit etc.\n\nAnd we aren\u2019t married and don\u2019t live together. You have the most legally binding contract going in a marriage and you didn\u2019t have to give your correct DoB anywhere to make that legal? A mortgage? You didn\u2019t show your wife any of the paperwork with your birth date on for all that stuff and went out of your way to hide it and you are surprised she is doubting you?\n\nIt\u2019s not about the age per se but the fact past a certain point in a serious relationship you have to work to hide this stuff. I don\u2019t go by my government name but a shortened middle name and it comes up pretty quickly in anything legal like my bank card, taxes, healthcare with a partner or boss. Meanwhile most of my friends have no idea I switched names thirty years ago as a kid in a different country until it makes a funny story as the name could not suit me less.\n\nYTA.", "Yeah YTA\n\nI don't understand why you felt the need to lie in college (there seem to be many students who start college at 17), I don't understand why you didn't tell you GF/Fiance and now wife the truth as soon as possible. I don't understand how this hasn't come up before now in some manner when completing all manner of paperwork in the last 7-8 odd years.\n\nAnd now you can't understand why she is upset with you.  Let me give you a hint - you've lied to your wife for the last 13 years, now she's wondering what else you've lied about, she's wondering if she can trust you", "YTA, You should never lie about your age, can u not see why your wife is upset? You had her unknowingly date a minor because you were too proud, but no, you also kept that lie for 14 years, that makes it worse.", "If this is true, which I highly doubt, YTA for lying for years. Yet, how can you be with someone for so long and never needing and/or coming into contact with their official DOB?", "YTA.\n\nYou lied to her for over a decade.", "YTA, I think it would've made sense for you to disclose your age to your wife. End of the day you got married to her so hiding this 'insignificant' secret makes zero sense", "YTA. How many birthdays have you lied about? That is so crazy/unhinged. You literally celebrated fake events then. She feels violated. She doesn't look at those memories the same. I'd break up/ divorce because I don't do dishonesty at all. It was so pointless to lie but you did it anyway. I don't like liars because it means you've done it before and will do it again ( and say \"it was so small \").  It's not dramatic if she looks at all your memories differently and can't look at you the same. These were events she felt made you two closer. She's allowed to leave you. Sorry you don't own her. You can't control how she will react but I bet you want to.", "YTA. Why didn't you say something the first time you got to your birthday, or even a significant birthday? You understand how your wife must feel, right? That if you've lied to her about such a fundamental thing as how old you are, she doesn't know what else you could be lying about. That's a terrible feeling to have about a spouse and you need to do something urgently if you want to save your marriage. Trust walks into town but leaves on a galloping horse.", "How the hell did this never come up? If nothing else, surely your DOB is on your marriage license, passport, loads of other documents your wife will have seen?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. It isn\u2019t about your age. It\u2019s that you kept a lie going for 14 years. If you could lie about that for so long what else might you be lying about?", "a lie for X amount of time is still a lie.\n\na \"small\" lie is still a lie.\n\nI'm sure she's wondering what else you lied about. Age doesn't matter, so why lie about that. So if you lied about something so small, then what other things have you lied about? Have you lied when you said she was pretty? Have you lied when you said told her you love her? Have you lied about the people you've been with? Have you lied about the things you like/dislike. If you meet again, and say her dress is pretty, is that a lie?\n\nthis is the problem with \"little lies\". If you are willing to lie about something small, then you will DEFINATELY lie about the big stuff.", "Info: How can she not know your full birthday date? She never had to fill any form that requires your birthday?\nThere is a lot missing here!", "This is weird. How come she\u2019s never seen your passport / driver\u2019s license/ ID card in all this time you\u2019ve been together? Have you guys bought property together, taken loans, filled out forms of any kind? I find it hard to believe that you haven\u2019t, and that this hasn\u2019t come up before. I don\u2019t think this is real.", "INFO: are you from a cultural background where changing ages/birthdate is a common thing? Is she?

Something that's done to get into better schools etc...\n\nBut that's generally not kept secret among loved ones, I don't understand why this has to be such a big secret? Why didn't it ever come up when you started dating? When you commit to someone, why not trust them to handle this information? I really don't get it, this seems like something you'd discuss fairly early on.", "If I were your wife, I\u2019d wonder why you chose to lie about something so small for so long and what else you\u2019re lying about. \n\nYTA. Betrayed her trust completely.", "YTA\u2026. Given that this has gone on for years and you guys are married, well can\u2019t understand why she is taken aback and shocked.\n\nYes it\u2019s can seem like a small thing granted but given that you have a bday every year and that actually gave you so many chances to make it right and you didn\u2019t.", "ESH: \n\nWhy would you marry her without telling her your real age... that's a big red flag as you're lying about a important life fact. I don't think the age is the issue here, its that you weren't honest especially when things got serious. \n\nIn the same breath she is being a little dramatic and should at least talk to you and express why she's angry.", "Why would you stand out being 17 in collage? Did you meet your wife in collage? Have you been lying about your age for 15 years?", "YTA\n\nfor posting a bullshit story that never happened", "YTA. That's the kind of lie you set straight before marriage.", "How did she never see a paper with your birthday on it? How in after all these years of dating and marriage your real age never came up?? Birthday parties/dinners? Get togethers with your family? I'm surprise it lasted as long as it did. YTA\n\nEdited to add: no one really cares about your age in college. I'm 2 years older than most of my peers. There's 2 women in their thirties. Someone mid twenties, several years older than me as well. No one cares.", "ESH this is so weird for so many reasons, has to be fake", "How do you get married to someone and not know their age? You literally have to sign a legal document which shows both of your dates of birth. \n\nYou\u2019re both the asshole.", "YTA. In fact you are such a massive AH that quite a few others could probably fit inside you. You start your married life living a lie and you are surprised when she reacts like this? She is now asking herself if she can actually trust you and what else have you lied about. Why the hell did you not tell her before you got engaged? Why the hell did you not tell her when you started getting serious? You win the award of AH of the Week for this.", "ESH.  It reads like you met your future wife when she was 18 but you were 17.  In some areas, that would make your girlfriend a felon.  Unless you two dated for a year before having sex.  Then again, seeing that there was one year difference...\n\nThe age difference thing is not that big of a deal.  So it boils down to a huge lie that you hid from your wife FOR 14 YEARS!!!!   Wow...\n\nStill, if I was with my partner for 14 years and all was OK except I JUST learned that  she's one year younger than she told me she was?  I think I'd be more suprised or amazed, rather than upset.\n\nYou screwed up.  But your wife is over-reacting.", "NTA\n\nI assume over the years your wife has had to give out your birthdate on things? Signed a marriage certificate that includes you DOB?   \nBeen to birthday parties of yours where there were people referencing your age?   \nHow the blazes did she NOT know your age?   \nWhy on this wonderful planet did you have to TELL her?

And she\u2019s being a bit over dramatic staying with her parents for a week. \n\nI get it though. I was 17 and was out drinking with friends on the weekend. A new bouncer (P) started working at the pub I was a regular at, so they let me in without ID, as I was a regular. P and I started dating, and because he worked on the door of my local jaunt, I didn\u2019t tell him I wasn\u2019t quite 18 (UK, so it\u2019s legal to drink at 18). A couple of months in, we went to visit my grandparents and my stepnan loudly asks \u201cSo what are you doing for your 18th?\u201d  I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me whole. Afterwards, we got in the car and he was mad. Wondered why I hadn\u2019t told him, so I said if we broke up he wouldn\u2019t let me in the pub because I was underage. It turned out that technically he\u2019d lied to me about his age too, as he feared I\u2019d think he was too old for me. We didn\u2019t argue, I didn\u2019t pack my bags (I moved in with him really fast when we started dating), we didn\u2019t not speak for a week. He was annoyed, sure. But said it was too late anyway because he loved me. So that was the end of it. \n\nYour wife should\u2019ve gotten over it like P did with me. \n\nOh and just to add, I was 17 in the March when we met, and turned 18 in the August. So I was 5 months younger than he thought I was.", "You're not an asshole.

Fair to assume she'd be upset but a whole week of no contact?  I think she's over reacting.", "NAH.

It's the fact you lie about something so minor (only \"minor\" because the age difference isn't big) so she'll never know if you really got stuck in traffic, bumped into a friend while shopping, have to work late. She can't trust you now. That's the issue.\n\nYou lied about something you had absolutely no reason to lie about, so what else are you willing to lie to her about?", "YTA", "I'm going to call BS on this in 13-14 years she never saw your actual birth date.  Filling out a marriage license? She never saw your driver's license? Or anything else?", "So let me get this straight, she has been with for literally years, and doesn't know your birthyear??", "You've been married all this time and your wife wasn't privvy to the year you were born? \n\nA typical trip to pick up my husband's prescription would require that I give his birth year. She's never done that while running errands? She's never seen your passport, if you have one, or reserved airline tickets? \n\nIt's really odd she didn't know you were a year younger than she is. YTA.", "ESH to a degree. Not sure why you wouldn't have told her early on in the relationship, but her staying with her parents for a week is a pretty big overreaction. It is kinda weird you never mentioned it or it never came up before though.", "Okay. I was in almost the same situation on the other side. I thought my partner was a year different than his actual age and only found out I was wrong by random chance, except that he didn't lie- I just assumed it. I felt mildly embarrassed that I didn't know my partner as well as I thought I did. It stung a little. Your wife may be feeling hurt that you never once mentioned to her, even casually, that your age was different than you originally said. YTA for never taking the time to do so. It's not necessarily that big a deal (it wasn't in my case), but it is also considered a red flag to *actively lie* about your age as a man. Talk it out with her and do something together to rekindle that close feeling.", "Exactly. Marriage certificate. Taxes. Deeds for house or tenancy. And has she never been to one birthday party? Pretty sure his parents wouldn't have put a year younger on every single cake, and just know accidentally spills the beans? I feel like we're missing details or being mislead", "That second paragraph is what really gets me. I write my husband's full birthdate a lot! Buying plane tickets, handling medical stuff for anyone in the family (we're on my husband's work insurance so it's \"his\" account), I don't even know what else.\n\nSo either a) this post is fake, b) OP has never let his wife handle any official paperwork in order to perpetuate his \"no big deal\" lie, or c) he I guess got an ID with the fake birthdate, put said fake birthdate on everything including their marriage license, and caused his wife to inadvertently commit fraud? Any of those means YTA.", "Even starting a relationship with lies isn't wise", " I'd break up divorce because I don't do dishonesty at all. It was so pointless to lie but you did it anyway. I don't like liars because it means you've done it before and will do it again and say \"it was so small . It's not dramatic if she looks at all your memories differently and can't look at you the same.", " If you are willing to lie about something small, then you will DEFINATELY lie about the big stuff.", "Are you good bro he literally answers all that in the post", "To be fair the lie was for everyone.", "Yup. I once discovered a few months into dating a guy he had lied online about his age. Said he had typed by error. I wasn\u2019t super into him and actually the info made me *less* freaked out what age he\u2019d had a kid at as it meant he\u2019d been 23 not 19.\n\nWe were pretty casual so I brushed off the red flag. We dated for 9 months and I discovered he had 2 other children, one older, one born the same year as the original kid who he had never met. I didn\u2019t want to date anyone with kids and we broke up. Partly because he was terrifyingly fertile and I am child free by choice.\n\nAnd in the process of breaking up I discovered his nice flat I had never visited was in fact him squatting after being evicted, he was a gambling addict and now has an Interpol warrant for dealing crack cocaine and being involved in money laundering. Oh and he was unmedicated bipolar. And faked his regional accent. He was not from that area at all but people found the accent sexy. (I did not. It reminded me of my granddad!)\n\nI doubt OP is going to be quite as cautionary a tale but I learned that if you lie about small things particularly in your identity, you are too comfortable with lying to be trustworthy for big things. Especially if you got anyone else to back the lie up\u2026", "That\u2019s nonsense, you can\u2019t just say that one lie means all lies.", "Brain didn\u2019t register that he mentioned they met in collage, so yeah he does answer two of my questions.", "Oh, I missed the part where he said they met in collage, sis. My bad", "My great aunt has lied about her age for decades even on official things so whenever she has to confirm her DOB she has to think about which one she used.", "Yup, people do lie. My grandma was 65 for over 20 years.", "Exactly! I'm not one to accuse posts of being fake, but this one is really hard to believe. Shit, my husband and I had to fill out a practical book to get our marriage license and it most definitely required both of our DL and birth certificates in order to apply. I couldn't imagine finding out that he hid something so big for over a decade, nor can I fathom how it wouldn't be discovered sooner.", "Doesn\u2019t even have to be a spouse. My roommate & I are best friends and completely platonic, but we were friends for 2 years before we moved in together and have been living together for 5 years, and I pick up prescriptions for her all the time. I have her birthdate memorized, even if I occasionally trip up because of a brain fart. We grab things for each other out of the other\u2019s wallet and little things like that, too. We\u2019ve also travelled together via airplane, and I think you need DOB for flights. There\u2019s absolutely no way a spouse could lie for almost 15 years."]}
