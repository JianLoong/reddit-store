It's good to make memories with each kid individually.", "NTA tons of people take kids on birthday trips without siblings...if anything the 9 year old might be hurt but they all went within the last year", "NTA simply because she is your kid and it is something you are doing for her birthday. Kids need to learn that not everyone gets to do all the activities that the other kids get to. If it was a pattern where you excluded all the other kids that would be different, but this is a special occasion. \n\nDoes he expect all six kids to go to a birthday party only one kid is invited to or any other activity that only one kid is going to?", "His kids'... motherS?

It would be one thing if your boyfriend said you were playing favorites and giving your daughter a trip your younger kid wouldn't get, but it sounds like that's not the issue.  Not everything has to be done altogether, and managing a group of 8 at Disneyland is asking a lot (to say nothing of cost)\nNTA", "NTA. It's her birthday and you want to take a trip with her. One on one time with the parent and child is so important, even in nuclear families. More so in blended families as the needs of the individual children can be pushed to one side if the blend is being forced. Go. Enjoy this time with her. If your other half has an issue with you bonding with your child for 2 days then I'd question this in the long run.", "NTA.  Taking your 13yo to Epcot is none of BF's business.  His claim of unfairness is exposed as untrue because you aren't taking your other child.  Take her to Epcot.  BF will try to punish you for your independence, but IMO he can be ignored and you can be comforted by remembering the weekend with child.", "No you\u2019re NTA. Birthdays are special and so is one-on-one time with your daughter. Take the trip with zero guilt!", "\"He thinks it's wrong to take 1 kid.\"\n\nWell\u2014he'd be wrong about that.

(If you thought you had that subject all squared away, and he\u2019s trying to change the deal because Disney, then obviously that\u2019s on him.)", "NTA. How wonderful for you to spend special time with your daughter. Especially with 6 kids between the two of you, each kid will benefit from having special time of their own.

Also, do the 4 other children spend time with their mom?  If so, you might wait until they're with their mom to take your daughter, however, I would feel a little odd about taking only one of my kids.  Doesn't make you an a-hole, just a matter of preference.", "Not enough info. Will your other kid get such an extravagant birthday? Do you have to travel far?

Not married, not his children, none of his business.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think either of you have yet crossed a line to AH territory. Taking a kid on a birthday trip is not an AH move. I think your partner raises some valid concerns. That said, I think you and your partner need to discuss how to approach this type of situation and agree going forward. With blended families like yours, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure both parents are on the same page so you aren\u2019t showing blatant favoritism. \n\nAlso, if he\u2019s watching your 9YO while you go on a trip, you should make sure he\u2019s ok with that, too. \n\nI\u2019d say take your kid on the trip, but be open to the fact that when his kids turn 13, you need to be ok with a reciprocal effort.", "INFO\n\nFirst, who is going to watch your 9yo while you're gone? If you expect your BF to do it, is he ok with that? Is your 9yo ok with that?\n\nSecond, do you plan on taking the 9yo on extravagant trips like that when they turn 13? \n\nNTA, unless you answer no to any of those questions.

Do you expect him to watch the other one?", "who is watching the 9 year old? \n\n if he is then YTA\n\nIf no then NTA, you can do what you want with your kids.  you are not even married", "INFO:\n\nWho is looking after your 9 year old while you're away?", "Do you plan on having such big gifts for your other kids when they have milestone birthdays?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend needs to worry about his own kids, not yours.", "info - are you living together? If so, whether married or not it's not his kids vs your kids, it should be OUR kids. Are you planning to be a family or are keeping kids separate?\n\nI suppose it is fine if you want to take 1 kid on an expensive trip for a bday. However, you should consider that an option for all your kids not just 1. You say their mothers - but it's his kids so I assume you are going to watch his kids while he takes 1 to Disney World too? Or are you saying your other daughters father will be watching her during this trip?\n\nIf only 1 child in the family is getting this type of gift, then I would say YTA. This would create jealously between the kids and most likely cause them to act out and dislike you.", "INFO:  Do you live together?\n\nNTA would be my initial vote, but I do think some things change when you live together.  Like - do you expect him or any of his kids to take care of your other child while you are gone?  And - even if you are paying - will it affect any household/shared expenses.", "NTA. It\u2019s not his call.", "NTA.\n\nNothing wrong with it BUT only if you do equivalent valuable things for your other kid\u2019s birthday too. Otherwise it\u2019s not fair for all the kids, let alone your own.\n\nYou can have time alone with each of your kids it\u2019s actually great for them to have this kind of moments, especially after blending in such a big family. But think this through, 2 days alone at Disney as a birthday is setting the expectations high for everybody else.", "NAH, but you both have some work to do on communicating on how to blend the family together. What is 'fair' to each of these kids is complicated. I would tend to agree with your side of it, but he has a point that I don't think qualifies as an 'asshole' response.", "You shouldn't feel bad for wanting to take your kid on a birthday trip.
