My husband (then bf) said he loved my long hair and the pixie, that I looked like a fairy.\n\nI grew it out for our wedding, and maintained long hair until after the birth of our second child in 2020. I had been losing hair (PP hair loss) and our newborn was ripping out my baby hairs on the bottom of my neck. Since we were in lockdown I decided to shave my head because I\u2019ve always wanted to and never had the courage to, and if I looked insane nobody would be seeing it.\n\nI walked out of the bathroom with a full shaved head and to my surprise, I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed not having to style my hair at all, my delightfully round head, and it made my face really pop. My husband was supportive but always finished with, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until your hair is long again\u201d. \n\nI shaved my head twice more since then because I really love having shorter hair. Since my hair has started growing out again my curls have returned. It\u2019s so curly and I love it (still v short, nearly a pixie). With it being curly I\u2019ve asked that he not run his finger through my hair as it causes it to lose it\u2019s styling and makes the curl look frizzy and unkempt.\n\nThis morning he aggressively ran his finger through my hair, and I did as I have don\u2019t many times before. I gently move his hand away from my head and remind him, \u201cit ruins my curls\u201d. He was instantly grumpy with me and has been gruff since. \n\nThis seems unfair because I\u2019m letting it grow out for him, but if I\u2019m the one having to style it so it looks good I don\u2019t want him messing it up.\n\nSo, AITA for asking him to not touch my hair?\n\nUpdate: thank you all so much for responding!\n\nWe talked about it when he got home. He apologized for touching it and for being gruff over my pushback.  We agreed on nighttime head scratches and sexy time hair play, and to ASK BEFORE TOUCHING. We\u2019re tabling the length of my hair until the kids go down.

I don\u2019t touch it. \n\nEveryone saying things about how you should let your husband touch your hair or find agreed upon times to do it is telling you to concede boundaries to him which is lowkey messed up. \n\nNTA and stand your ground while y\u2019all talk over this.", "Curly girl here. NTA. Having curly hair and maintaining it is a lot of work. Sometimes they look just like you want them to and sometimes they refuse to cooperate and when you finally hit that sweet spot where it curls the way you want....you wanna preserve it until your next wash day. Your hair, your rules", "NTA It\u2019s not about your hair, it\u2019s about bodily control. Your husband trying to mess up your hair is a reaffirmation that he is trying to control your body, same way he is trying to guilt trip and emotionally manipulate you into growing your hair for him. \n\nA loving partner would not be controlling you like this OP, please be vigilant to what is really going on here.", "I got no dog in this fight, but if you are growing it out so he can enjoy it, then let him enjoy it.  If you feel peeved he prefers it long, then do as you wish.\n\nIf you grow it out long to please him, then are an AH about it, you have achieved a lose / lose.", "This is the dumbest AITA I\u2019ve read so far. YTA", "[deleted]", "Just wanna say \u201cagreed upon time your husband can touch your hair\u201d sounds insane.", "This is exactly what I was thinking as I read this. At this point it's not about what her hair is like, it's about the fact that when she pushes his hand away from touching her, to him it will feel like rejection of intimacy (I'm like you in that I also love touching the hair of any girl I've been with and the idea of being pushed away like that would be immediately quite upsetting).", "I also have curly hair and my mom is always trying to touch it. She also has no concept about time or place. I\u2019ll usually let her touch it when I haven\u2019t done my hair routine, it\u2019s not as curly and very frizzy, or when I did but don\u2019t have anywhere else to be. \u201cWhy can I touch it then and not now?\u201d Because the the curl patterns breaks and I\u2019m left with a frizzy mess", "Hmm. I\u2019m not excusing his behavior but I\u2019m trying to understand both sides here. On his side, to me it feels that her husbands love of her longer hair was part of an intimate connection with her. Now that\u2019s gone and perhaps the husband is mourning that loss of intimacy? I think they need to discuss both boundaries and what this change has them both feeling.", "its not just the visual, we as men want to fill it, its very seductive\n\nu can curl it right back with wet hands btw", "Also, the end of the day, like right before bed, is a good time as well. Sleep is just going to mess it up anyway.", "Hopefully her husband is also receptive and understanding. He has to work on dealing with his feelings and disappointment surrounding this issue, and being told no to touching her hair.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to keep your hair in a certain style to protect your husbands fragile ego. Like if he wants long hair he can grow his own. Shave your head again and be free!", "EXACTLY. My mom used to ask me why I don\u2019t brush my hair \ud83d\ude44 my mom is East Asian and doesn\u2019t have that kind of hair and used to just be really negative about my hair.  She didn\u2019t really try and touch it but I\u2019ve definitely had strangers try to touch my hair. People really don\u2019t understand how fragile curls are, they will decide to turn into a poof ball at a single drop of water.", "It is hardly healthy for a married couple not to be allowed to touch each other's *hair*, unless it's some kind of kink :)", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Lololol", "Have you ever heard of a saying \"Your body, your rules\"?\n\nNo? Time for a wake up call then, buddy.", "My hair is pretty greasy on a wash day- if he\u2019s cool with it, I would be too.", "So, you were absolutely fine with shaving your hair off completely, but you're super protective now that it looks good styled, so much so that you won't let your husband touch it?  Kinda crappy.  He's your husband and he finds you attractive and enjoys touching your pretty hair.  If he weren't your husband, but say, your boyfriend of three months, would you tell him hands-off!  No.  Because you'd want to please him and would likely be flattered that he thought you were so attractive.  But you're married now.  So he can fuck right off when your hair looks nice.  Meh.  I think yta.", "Attitudes like yours lead to assault, so I return the sentiment.", "I love your thought process on this! I'm going to try to remember this for future use. Thank you!  \n\n\nLove the user name, btw! Gave me a giggle!", "Two of my family members have beautiful curly hair. I have definitely felt the urge to play with it but they\u2019ve trained me well: no touching the curls without permission!! Meanwhile I have a very thick, almost wiry but only slightly wavy pixie cut and it doesn\u2019t care if anyone touches it haha. Which is good because my bird is always landing in it.", "Ugh, hairbrushes and curly hair do NOT co-exist peacefully. The only time my hair ever sees a brush is in the shower when it's full of conditioner. Doing it dry turns it from a mass of formed curls to a dandelion.", "My daughter inherited thick curly hair from her dad and had her first undercut last summer. She absolutely loves it!", "LOL birds are HELL on curly hair! And it's their #1 favorite place to land. It's like those talons become combs.", "This really needs to become mainstream knowledge. It's life changing! I wish I'd known what a difference it makes ages ago.", "I clicked on all 3 and it\u2019s the same video but I still watched them all because it\u2019s the most adorable thing!", "Know this is going to get downvoted,  and I absolutely agree with the fact that \u201cyour body your decision\u201d is always the rule. But we\u2019re moving to a dark place when we throw that up for husbands touching curls when a simple \u201cshare with him how difficult it is for you to maintain your curls and trust he\u2019ll get it once he understands\u201d would suffice. If that alone wouldn\u2019t suffice then there\u2019s a bigger problem.\n\nOnly say this because he\u2019s her husband and if she needs to be reminded \u201cyour body your decision\u201d in her own house then it means it\u2019s probably a serious situation that is not healthy for her to be in and she should establish a space where she is not fearful for her personal boundaries and her body is respected.", "I love the above idea. I have a feeling his love language is touch and he is feeling that you are rejecting it. Finding a way he can express it is a great compromise for you both", "I mean, if ignoring someone when they say stop is what you need to turn you on, you are why HR exists. ;)", "Never claimed or acting like I\u2019m fixing anything, that\u2019s your opinion. I only claimed that this is a honestly silly issue to get hung up on, cause at the end of the day, it\u2019s just hair; so clearly the true issue transcends past a low level breach of boundaries that is quite mundane. Your clearly fishing for virtue, not an objective assessment.", "Ooh I should try this out. Curly girl here too and I don't like my hair touched and my husband DOES respect that, but does look forward to the moment when my curls have died. So he'd probably be into scrunching instead, and my allowing it!", "She certainly is saying that last part. Plenty of people in this sub agree, apparently.", "My wife's hair is curly. When it's long enough (it seldom is) I like to grab the end of one and lightly pull it and say \"boing!\" as it bounces back. It brings me joy\n\nThat said, if it bothered her I absolutely wouldn't do that anymore!", "It's ridiculous how long it took for those products to be developed. I use olive oil instead of avocado because of the price, but both are good. Curly haired people wash then ADD oil, unlike straight-haired folk.", "You could have a time, once a month or so where he can wash it, dry it, and learn to style it. Good practice if you have a daughter.", "I should try that, because my hair is generally as dry as a pile of twigs lol.", "I have fairly dry hair and don't do a lot to get it dirty, so I only wash my hair once or twice a week, which makes the avocado oil more reasonably priced for me. If I had to wash my hair everyday, it'd be a different story. Plus, I rarely have to use any other products, so I save that expense. But those other products... yes, it took forever for them to be developed and it's still so hit and miss what will work, and finding what works can get expensive quick. Learning not to wash my hair to death and that basic oils work wonders were game changers for me.", "I move a good bit when I sleep, but I pineapple my hair and wear a satin bonnet.  My curls usually look great in the morning.", "Yes!!! Undercuts are the best! Getting my undercut has made dealing with my curls so much easier. I wish I'd done it years ago it would have saved me fighting with my hair so much. 10/10 recommend and a 'wet brush' best hair decisions I've made.", "You and I would make the best of friends!", "Same", "OMG! Absolutely true! My hair is pretty straight, whith a couple of weird cowlicks and the random wavy patch, but a few of my good friends over the years have those beautiful curls and you\u2019re absolutely right\u2014brushing/ messing with it will cause them to look like a dandelion puff. Never thought of it in those words, but your phrasing just tickled my funny bone! \ud83d\ude0a", "disagree on what? reality?", "Until your hair is too thin", "You're welcome.\n\n I am laughing at how many people are unhinged over the concept of not being entitled to touch their partner however and whenever they want when the partner has indicated it's not OK.\n\nLike, hey, \"can you not do that right now and wait until closer to bedtime\" is just sending them into a spiral. \n\n...no wonder AITA has so many posts over horrible communication skills.", "Ramona Quimby got in big trouble for this", "Brilliant! Yes!

Works wonders for bed hair.", "Oh my God yes. My hair is curly, but because it's super thick and I usually have it in a bun because my tiny human is also a hair puller, it doesn't look as curly as it would if I actually styled it.

When I go to bed with my hair wet I say I wake up looking like Witch Hazel (from Looney Tunes), but it really looks like a cheap, bad curly Halloween wig fresh out of the package.
