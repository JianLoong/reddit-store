I gently move his hand away from my head and remind him, \u201cit ruins my curls\u201d.

Was replying to other poster. My bad.", "That part. Technical definitions aren't always indicative of the situation dynamics at play.", "Now would she be my wife.", "Again, I said nothing about legalities.  No one in this thread did, actually, except those of you viscerally reacting to being told \"it's wrong to touch or be touched without permission, and it's okay to acknowledge that.\"  What's so threatening about that concept?", "nobody's talking about pressing charges, you just went there because calling nonconsensual touching 'assault' (which it legally is) hurts your little feelings for some reason. dont be so sensitive, facts dont care about your feelings", "Hell, sometimes we have to gentle parent ourselves", "Do you have really curly/kinky hair? I dont think you understand how much work goes into not only styling but literally just maintaining curly hair. Like bare minimum for healthy hair is a bunch of detangling and sometimes leave in moisturizers. When someone runs their hands through someone with 4b hair for example it isnt just undoing styling and messing up hair it is creating knots which can lead to hair damage/increase friction.", "None of what he wrote excuses her husband for disregarding her boundaries lmao. He\u2019s TA full stop. It doesn\u2019t fucking matter if \u201che LOVES your hair\u201d if she\u2019s not comfortable with it. You aren\u2019t entitled to disregard your spouse\u2019s bodily autonomy just because you\u2019re married. The guy I\u2019m replying to thinks her husband is not an asshole for his actions (implied by his NAH judgement)  and is just excusing him for not respecting her boundaries. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s malicious or not. If someone tells you not to touch them, don\u2019t fucking touch them. He\u2019s literally putting the onus on OP to just deal with it instead of her husband just respecting her boundaries.", "I didn\u2019t say you did or that I feel threaten. You just made me understand that I was assaulted by many women and I have a right file a lawsuit when I am assaulted, right?", "What's the point of labeling it assault if you aren't thinking of the picture in it's entirety? You can't just stop the thought process at labeling it assault because it fits the point you're trying to make. \n\nYou keep bringing up the \"legal\" aspect. A true assault warrants legal action. \n\nThis, does not.", "It\u2019s the only way I can possibly gentle parent my child is to gentle parent myself first lol", "Depending on your local laws, I imagine you do!  Good luck, I hope you're able to get some restorative justice.\n\nMore seriously, though, I hope that you do feel good about the touch in your past (you seem to, from your sarcasm).  That's great!  Many of us don't, and there are cultural pressures that make it all worse and perpetuate issues around consent and bodily autonomy.  As evidenced by this comments section.  But that's a long uphill battle."]}
