Brazen and horribly rude of your sister to expect you to financially support her children. How you spend your money is none of her business, and neither is the financial situation of your in-laws. \n\nHow did her husband react to all of this? If I were him I would be very embarrassed.", "NTA.\n\n Fair isn't always equal. You are supporting your wife and her family in a way they need. Equity, not equality.\n\nYour sister is not entitled to dictate those relationships for you. Your family sounds messed up.", "NTA. How you spend your money is not your sister\u2019s business. Full stop.", "NTA. One of my sisters tried to pull this shit in me. Our middle sister went through a bad divorce and now lives in a single wide trailer. She has 2 kids living with her so I bought them a basic $200 TV (maybe 55 inches). Oldest sister was telling our mom that I bought them a $500 tv and all sorts of stupid shit. Oldest sister is divorced but gets insane alimony and child support. The kids are in objectively different circumstances. It\u2019s stupid and selfish", "NTA, and please note that the second she heard the word no, your sister ran to tattle to your parents, as though they have power over you.\n\nThey don't.\n\nYou know what else? She doesn't.\n\nYou don't owe her zilch. Show her how wrong she is by going NC on her, and don't spend money on her kids. Let her feel it, so she stops getting on your case with her greed.\n\nPeople foolishly think that our family members all love us. Your sister thinks of you as an ATM. That joke your BILs make about you is very real to her. It's not a joke. And it isn't love.", "Equity and equality are two very different things.

When yiu say \"my family is financially well off\", does that include her? \n\nIf she's not, then NTA. You're taking care of your BILs as a kindness because their parents are struggling.\n\nWhat you offered to your sister is great already. Your neices and nephews can learn about responsibilities by earning money from you. You shouldn't have to co-parenting them for your sister.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think your sister equates money with love and so the more or less you spend on someone means the more or less you love them in her eyes.

Hopefully she doesn't pass this trait off to her kids the way she seems to have inherited it from your folks.", "In the first place, this isn't any of your sister's business, and it's kind of greedy and self-serving to demand it of you.\n\nIn the second place, if your sister can't see the different situations of her self and your spouse's family, she isn't looking very hard.\n\nIn the third place, calling your in-laws names and saying nasty things about them is completely unacceptable and uncalled for.

Firstly, it is your money. Secondly, you said your sister is in a much better position. \n\nIt sounds like you are doing a great thing for family, and I am sure the boys will remember this and hopefully succeed in life.

Your sister doesn't have a say in how you help your other family. \n\nI can't fathom someone asking this of you unless they were only interested in your money.", "Also if she doesn't have the money for her kids the sister needs to stop having children not rely /force op to support them.

Secondly, you make a very valid point about economic circumstances. Also those are her brothers, so closer family members than nieces and nephews if she wants to really get technical. Equity not equality. Also just sounds like your sister at least has a lot of resentment towards your wife and her family. It\u2019s hilarious that she claims they\u2019re using you for money in the same sentence that she\u2019s mad that you won\u2019t commit to a large financial obligation to her children", "NTA. You're not picking favourites. Your in laws literally cannot afford the stuff you're paying for. It makes sense that when there's that much of a disparity in wealth, there's going to be a difference in support.\n\nIt's safe to assume that when you said your family is well off, it included your sister, or at the very least your wealthy parents would be supporting her right?"]}
