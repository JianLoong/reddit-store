This is common not to want guest to visit immediately after birth. Side note: family gatherings are going to be real awkward after her disrespectful comments to her son about his wife.", "NTA\n\nShe can visit when you\u2019re home and are available and ready for visitors. It\u2019s not like the baby is going to turn into an adult overnight.\n\nJust keep the child away from growth hormones and fluorescent lights. -sarcasm-\n\nGood luck with your monster-in-law, you\u2019ll need it.", "NTA, you are the one who is going under the knife. You get a choice who you want and not want there. It's not wrong for not wanting to be around people when you are not at your best, tired with all the aftermath and healing.\n\nYour MIL is pretty petty about this but I think your husband should also explain that even if there is a 3rd party that can be allowed in, it should be YOUR choice because the person is taking care of you. Its who you trust and feels comfortable most.\n\nGet your husband to man up and manage his mother. It's his responsibility.", "NTA. Your the one growing and birthing it, it\u2019s your choice not hers.", "NTA. Your pregnancy, your baby, your right to do what you know will work for you. In  addition, at the hospital, you are the patient, so your needs and wants come first and foremost.\n\nYour MIL's behaviour, if that was really her reaction, is abusive and disgusting. Having given birth herself, she should have some understanding as to what it is like for a first time mother. She is the AH.  \n\nLastly did your husband not tell her she is not the only one from whom you don't want a visit until you are ready, but also your own father? If she was, then she sounds like a narcissist. Your husband needs to set her straight and tell her, that you are doing what is right for you and in turn the baby, if you want help from her, then you will reach out, but is likely to turn to someone else after that abusive tirade. He should also tell her never to trash talk his wife ever again. She owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\n\nFirst off make it clear when you do actually go in to hospital staff that only your husband is allowed. No other visitors. That way the won't let anyone in to see you or give out updates.\n\nSecond ... Take your time. Heal up and bond with your baby. Get a routine going for you and hubby.\n\nThird..  this flu season just started and is down right nasty this year. Let your baby build up their immune system first. Don't risk RSV or flu because people are feeling butt hurt and won't listen.\n\nYour compromise plan is a good one. She can accept it or just stew in the dark then. Especially after all that crap she spewed about you.", "NTA.  You can definitely choose when you want visitors and who those visitors should be.  I would just keep in mind, if you do have a c section, you may need some help.  You will be healing and you and your husband may need support .

Set those boundaries now so she knows she doesn\u2019t get a say in how you raise your child.", "NTA, what the hell. \n\nI guess your MIL just showed her true colors and you know to not leave her alone with your child.

And do send yiur husband to deal with that, it's his mother, he should know how to talk to her. \n\nI hope your delivery goes well, and you are not disturbed for as long as you need to heal up after the experience. <3", "NTA. That sounds a nightmare and it's even worse because the situation is you would be trying to heal from giving birth (worse if it's a C-section). It took my mom 6-8 weeks to heal from her first C-section & she was not in the mood for visitors even after she healed. \n\nAs the person who is giving birth, it is entirely your call if you want to see people or not while you are recovering. And as the parents, you both are the only ones who get to decide who gets to see your kids.", "NTA", "Nope nope nope NTA. Not at all. \n\nI have never had a baby so take it fwiw, but it's horrid to me that new mothers are pushed to be social and welcoming. If you want to, great. But even my nurse friends have been surprised by some of the things that happen after birth, and to want some privacy and time to recover and bond privately is one hundred percent fine. \n\nYou can tell them I said so and they can call me to argue about it.", "NTA \n\nYou will be recovering and bonding. You need rest. They can wait. \n\nWill the hospital even allow that many people? Mine has a strict limit of 2. Now that RSV Covid and Flu are bad, it has to be the same 2 every day.", "NTA at all. You're going through a big medical event, not hosting a party. Plus you'll have a newborn to care for while you're recovering. She needs to get a grip and respect your boundaries. She also needs to be held accountable for her words and not allowed any info or visits until she apologizes.\n\nAlso remind the whole family about RSV and that they're not allowed to kiss the baby anywhere until they're vaccinated. My town just had a tragic event where a grandma kissed her twin grandbabies and gave them RSV, the funerals were last weekend.", "YTA\n\nIf there had been a real medical reason to prohibit people I would understand but you haven\u2019t mentioned one. \n\nI know I\u2019ll be downvoted fit this but this is a decision that 5 years from now you\u2019ll regret. \n\nReasons you\u2019re wrong\n\n1. The hospital is the perfect place for them to get the baby fever out of their system. They won\u2019t expect you to entertain them, you won\u2019t be allowed to by the hospital staff. You will be surrounded by nurses in case anything happens\n2. You\u2019re alienating everyone who would be normally falling over themselves to help you. You\u2019re going to need help. The sleep deprivation is going to nearly kill you and your husband.  \n3. You\u2019re turning what should be a great reason for celebration throughout the family into a big conflict that people won\u2019t forget\n\nYou\u2019re creating more hardship for yourself and ruining relationships", "Agreed. OP definitely NTA and welcome to set whatever boundaries make her comfortable. Given MiLs reaction, probably best to set the most strict version now, too, and listen the reigns later if you feel comfortable. But, it's quite possible that you'll be happy to have company earlier than that. I also had a section and three weeks feels long to me.\n\nNot sure how MiL is with such things, but if you have people who really get/remember the newborn phase, they will be happy to fold a load of laundry or empty the dishwasher, which can be a huge help. Those friends and family are the ones you want around!", "I think you're right, it's totally fine to have whatever boundaries you need. And it's impossible to predict how people are going to recover or how difficult the delivery is going to be. My close friend had a c-section and she said it was almost 2 months before she started really feeling okay in her body again, she normally recovers from stuff super quickly, it was just really tough.", "NTA, MIL sounds bats**t crazy.", "All of this, and especially the point about the spouse. \n\nIt was very helpful of MIL to let all her \ud83d\udea9 hang out at this early stage so OP can clearly see them and be aware of them in future.", "Fr, MIL's acting like she's the one giving birth here. \n\nNTA", "So giving birth isn't a /real/ medical reason? Interesting.", "You have no medical history that would be a cause of concern?  None of your relatives are anti-vaxxers?  No?  OK then...\n\nMy wife had 2 c-sections, the first was unplanned and the second planned.  I understand the impact on her body and ultimately the best place to \"entertain\" is the hospital.  The hospital has security personnel who will enforce rules around visiting hours and the number of people.  Those that do visit will not expect you to do anything except lay in bed.  You will be surrounded by nurses and medical equipment if there is a problem.  If you grow too tired of people you can ask them to leave and doing so from a hospital bed is very persuasive.\n\nWhat you clearly fail to realize is that you and your husband are going to need a TON of help in the months and years after the birth from others.  Babysitting, daycare,   possibly financial, and you intend to antagonize the people who would have been most willing to help and instead will create bad feelings that will last for years and years.  You may still get help from them but it will be far more begrudgingly given.\n\nYou are making a mistake.  Gaining a few weeks of \"more comfort\" for the price of months and years and way less comfort.", "NTA. It\u2019s your body and your baby. Set whatever boundaries you like. Recovering from a C-section is exhausting, stressful, and painful, and adjusting to life with a small human is \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 exhausting, stressful, and often painful. You do not need anyone in your life who\u2019s going to make it harder.\n\nThe one upside to this is that you now know for sure that your mother-in-law is manipulative, entitled, and over-emotional, so you know that you\u2019re going to have to be firm with her. She won\u2019t like it \u2013 she\u2019ll probably get worse before she gets better \u2013 but keep calm and stick to your guns. She\u2019ll learn the new regime in time.", "NTA your reasons are very valid PLUS the flu and RSV are horrible this year.  You've made an awesome plan, stick with it!", "I barely glazed over the post. The title is plenty. You are never the asshole for restricting labor, birth, and postpartum visitors, nor any other hospital stay for that matter. I visited my DIL in the hospital once for less than an hour when the baby was over 24 hours old. I then did not go visit unless invited and if I was nearby, I sent a text asking if they needed anything while I was in their vicinity. Why? Because I don't demand my whims of my son & his wife seeing as how they're autonomous humans. My daughter complained that I was not involved enough when she had her babies. First off, I still have babies at home my own self, and second, but most importantly I didn't want to be all up in their business and annoying her or her partner. These intrusive mothers-in-law are truly boggling.", "NTA. People who respond to reasonable boundaries by throwing tantrums are exactly the kind of people who need boundaries *and consequences*.\n\nI\u2019d put her in a time out until she can behave in a reasonable way. You have what sounds like a high risk pregnancy, and it\u2019s not like having a new baby is easy under the best of circumstances.\n\nNone of this is about her.

You'll be recovering, yes, but there's a TRIPLEDEMIC going on right now, and infants are especially at risk. Your boundaries are very sensible, and I'm glad your husband is backing you up on this.", "NTA. Make sure the hospital and the nursing staff know about your no visitor rule. You can be unlisted so nobody can sneak in and try to see the baby.", "NTA.  Literally the only person I wanted to see other than my spouse for the first few weeks after I gave birth was my own mom because I knew she'd comfort me and help out when spouse had to go to work", "NTA, you will be exhausted, look a mess, and be in pain, and she can't wait 3 weeks? Dam, the entitlement", "\nI suggest you look at a reasonable compromise and the long term effects.\n\nReasonable compromise: the mother and sister come over while you take a nap or personal time and visit with your husband and the baby for thirty minutes or an hour. \n\nYou say you don\u2019t want visitors because you\u2019ll be crabby and irritable. You don\u2019t mention and health risk concerns. You don\u2019t have to deal with them while they visit. This should be a non issue.\n\nIf you choose to die on this hill, weigh the possible long term effects:\n\nWill this alienate your MIL & SIL? Yes. \n\nWill the alienation cause a strain on your husband and his mothers relationship? Yes.\n\nCould the strain on their relationship lead to resentment from your husband towards you and/or his mother & sister for putting him in the middle of bs? Possibly & probably. \n\nThese will be your husband & child\u2019s relatives for the rest of their life. You will have to deal with them for just as long. Is tension worth it? Will you still feel gratification for causing your loved one(s) undue stress and strife over something that could\u2019ve been solved with 30 minutes of compromise? Only you can answer this, but most people wouldn\u2019t. \n\nReddit is going to tell you that you\u2019re doing the right thing. Reddit hates MILs. Reddit hates compassion and reasonable compromise.
