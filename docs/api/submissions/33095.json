You're protecting your stuff.  Your sister has no right to them.", "NTA - you have the right to protect your stuff. You also need to inform your parents or have a family discussion about it with everyone present because you are an adult but your sister is not and the adults responsible for her need to teach her about boundaries.", "YWNBTA. Your sister has proven that setting verbal boundaries with her doesn't work which puts you in the position to have to more firmly set those boundaries, in this case by putting your things where she can't get to them. Your things are your things, no matter how expensive they are, and there is no excuse for taking them without your permission, especially when this is an ongoing issue. Definitely get the lock box.", "NTA. You say you handle things like civil siblings, but clearly she does not, hence the post. I\u2019m not saying tell on her, which was what that statement was about, but that you aren\u2019t the A H for taking unilateral steps to protect your stuff since she\u2019s decidedly not handling it in a civil manner.", "It's your stuff. You tried being diplomatic about it and she never listened. Wanting to keep your things yours isn't a bad thing to do. NTA", "YWNBTA at all. She's straight up stealing from you. I honestly don't trust her to not steal the lockbox, just to piss you off.", "If she acts like a child and doesn't respect your stuff, treat her like a child and lock your stuff away.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA. Those are your things, and she isn't entitled to them. If she tries to go to your parents about it, just explain it. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nMy son is an artist so I know how expensive proper art supplies can get.  I swear Prismacolor pencils must be made from gold.\n\nGet yourself a lockbox.  Use it.

Something else is going on here such as sibling rivalry, and I'm curious what she gets up to when she no longer has the chance to steal your art supplies.  I expect she will do something worse, such as make the lock box disappear or damage it, and you will have to let your parents know when that happens.  It's not helping her growth or emotional development to let her get away with this kind of theft and sabotage of her own sister.  And why are you the only one watching your little brother?  It sounds as though she has too much time on her hands.", "NTA. Good art supplies are so expensive, and theft is theft.", "NTA. Stealing things from anybody is wrong. Take back what she took from you. And keep it locked away from her thieving hands.", "Nta", "Get the lock box.", "NTA at all. \n\nI know you said that nothing she has taken, individually was expensive, I think if you added it all up it would probably come to a surprising total. She is stealing from you. You are not the asshole for protecting your property. \n\nAs for not telling your parents, that is up to you, I do not agree though. Her behavior is a sign of not respecting boundaries at all and your parents should know that their daughter is going down the path of being a thief which will bite her in the arse in the future.", "NTA tell your damn parents. She's a thief and a minor which makes it their responsibility to control their kid", "She is a thief.  Buy the box.  \n\nShe can use any excuse it doesn't change the fact she's a thief.", "She is 15 and needs to learnt the difference between right and wrong which your parents clearly failed to impart on her.

Also, unless you two share a bedroom, replacing your bedroom door's knob with one that has a keyed lock would be cheaper and better. It'd give you more space than a little box. Good luck.", "NTA get a lockbox. They are your supplies, she can ask to use them. If she has a hissy fit, ignore her and walk away.
