I'm not saying I'd be 100% sure that he's sleeping around, but the signs are not good. If I were you, I'd start covering my bases,  especially since you're expecting and have a child already.

That dude cheated, and on the 1% he didn\u2019t why would he do that? You are pregnant! And at 3 am? What were they doing til 3 am, and he was drunk? That is so not normal, acceptable, excusable or anything, I\u2019m so sorry \ud83d\ude1e get another std test done to be safe because something smells fishy here and that swim didn\u2019t wash it away.", "This is cheating.", "What the heck?! Dude has a VERY PREGGO wife in the house. And kid. Shows up with a woman who was staying at a hotel (one without a pool I guess?), and goes for a swim at 3am \u2026but it\u2019s the wife who thinks she might be TA? \u2026make it make sense. \n\nNTA. Hugely inappropriate, very dismissive of your feelings, and just gross. Who the eff does that?? Lady, you go get almost  nakey nakey in  the pool at 3am with some buff fella and let\u2019s see what tune he sings. What a nut.", "He is getting frisky wit this new chick. 100%. Swim at 3am was to wash her smell off him. What do you think they were doin at her hotel till 3am? Restaurant was closed hrs ago.", "NTA. It\u2019s safe to not assume things at this point, but this a is a hugeeee red flag. No partner would feel comfortable with this and you really need to talk to him about it and he has to respect your wishes too\n\nGiven the context of the scenario I\u2019m assuming a lot of sketchy things here, but going with what he said, it\u2019s still super duper weird", "NTA he should be swimming with you not other women.  There\u2019s something wrong with this whole thing your pregnant you have a child he should be helping you and be by your side. Im not advocating get out but it does seem he doesn\u2019t care for you as much as he should.  If he were my husband he probably would have already been an ex.  Please think of yourself, your child and child to be born, you all need someone that\u2019s more of a father and husband not a playboy.", "Nta, maybe once you are back in the game. Maybe invite some friends over and swim in ur bra and underwear.  See what he thinks.", "It was a total dick move on his part.", "NTA That\u2019s just some weird behaviour. The one silver lining is that he did this at your house and not a random hotel/river/puddle. It\u2019s not a great consolation but it is\u2026there.", "NTA. Normally I don't understand the \"I know nothing would happen but this is inappropriate\" line; either you trust someone or you don't. But this isn't nothing, and I wouldn't be so sure there isn't more to the story. Your husband is the asshole for letting this happen (at your house of all places!) and for not understanding why it might have upset you.", "Why is nobody mentioning that, quite aside from the woman, drunk swimming is inappropriate because it's dangerous? Throw in inviting a stranger over at 3am when you live with somebody (including a child!), skinny dipping with somebody other than your partner feeling a bit cheaty, the fact it's a woman and you feel uncomfortable, and his inability to apologise or acknowledge he did something wrong and GIRL, he needs to haul his arse to a marriage counsellor before he comes out of that spare room.", "NTA but get std tests if you\u2019ve been intimate with husband since the baby. He\u2019s screwing around on these dinners.", "If he's in his boxers,  what did she strip down to?", "Lord, these men today on Reddit. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Your husband sounds like an asshole. You are 6 months pregnant with his child, he should be sober swimming in a pool with you making you feel beautiful and making sure you get to laugh. Not getting drunk and bringing people home like a stupid selfish teenager. He needs to grow up and respect you more.", "NTA. He\u2019s a dick. And I considerate dick.", "In this situation, your feelings of anger and upset are completely valid. What your husband did was highly inappropriate, considering the late hour and the fact that it involved another woman in your home while you were there, pregnant and with your child. Your concerns about this incident are more than justified, especially when considering the boundaries and respect expected in a marriage. It's not an overreaction to be upset about such behavior, and your husband should be acknowledging and respecting your feelings rather than dismissing them. It's essential for both partners in a marriage to maintain trust, understanding, and respect for each other's boundaries, and this incident has undoubtedly crossed that line. It's worth having a serious and calm conversation to address these concerns, emphasizing the importance of respect and communication in the relationship.", "Nah screw that. Your not the ass. That\u2019s so messed up and disrespectful. I personally would be looking deep at if he is the right person for you one for doing it and two for seeming to think it\u2019s ok.", "NTA.  Honestly, being drunk is irrelevant here imo.  I absolutely hate when people use being drunk as an excuse.  If you cannot act like a functioning adult and turn into a randy 13 year old boy when you've been drinking, then you shouldn't be drinking.  What if your 3 year old would have woken up and seen this shitshow?  I have a 3 year old myself and she'd have been so confused and upset as to why Daddy was swimming in the pool with this random woman she doesn't know and not Mummy.  Very strange indeed.  Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot.", "You are not wrong.", "NTA :(", "NTA. Are you sure it was a business dinner? You should have confronted both of them - you\u2019d hope that being confronted by an angry pregnant wife would be enough to shame her into going straight home. Besides drunk swimming being very unsafe, his behaviour displays absolutely no respect for you or your marriage.", "NTA. But do you seriously believe nothing would\u2019ve happened? How were they out till 3am if they were out for dinner? \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t care about disrespecting your marriage or violating your boundaries. How would he feel if you were swimming with a friend in your bra? I\u2019d consider getting tested just in case and look into having a contingency plan", "NTA you should not get drunk swimming at all, if you like to see the birth of your child, and bringing strangers into a shared home at 3am is also weird. It is nothing wrong with swimming with someone tho. \nA bit impulsive, but that was probably the alcohol + \u201ehey you know what? I got a Pool\u201c", "Op you are being gaslighted into thinking you are the AH.", "NTA and no part of this is okay.", "You are NTA. Lot of wtf going on here.", "NTA but the bigger issue that it is a safety risk to go drunk swimming. I\u2019d personally be more worried about my husband drowning then the fact that he swam in underwear with a colleague. \n\nOP definitely has a right to be angry. This is a bit weird and you have the right to consent to company coming to your house. Period. Especially late at night. \n\nHowever, (this is probably going to be a unpopular take) it isn\u2019t quite as big a deal as OP thinks it is sexually. I think everyone could use a cooling off period so they can have a productive conversation. OP\u2019s husband was still covered up and I (22f) have been swimming in my underwear before when I didn\u2019t pack a swim suit (of course if my underwear wasn\u2019t too revealing). No one has ever had a problem with this and there have always been people wearing more revealing things at the swimming holes. \n\nBut yeah, bottom line is that OP needs to agree to anyone coming over to the house at night. And OP\u2019s husband should never drink swim.", ">NTA. It is unusual, but also it's a good sign it's at your house, eg proving he wasn't being sneaky with her with view to cheat.\n\nOr he thinks if he brings her home he can brag about how upfront and open it all was, so OBVIOUSLY nothing happened, you're overreacting, blah blah.", "how?  extremely inappropriate: yes, but cheating?", "Add drunk to that. Just reading this story makes me mad.", "This is the only answer", "He couldn\u2019t be more obviously sleeping with this woman if he entered her in front of his wife.", "this \ud83d\udcaf"]}
