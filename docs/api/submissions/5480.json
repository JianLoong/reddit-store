We have been married for two years and together for five. My parents gifted me a maternity shoot for an early Christmas gift and I had the shoot a few days ago. My stepchildren did not want to take part in it and I went ahead without getting photos of them with me and my bump. This really angered my ILs who believed I should have included them. But my husband and I did ask, and my husband encouraged them to join in, they did not want to. We do not have the closest relationship. They are fine with me but resist a closeness and felt that being in those photos would be too close. ILs said I should have cancelled the photo shoot and done them another day, when the kids would join in. They said I should have gone to their mother and tried to convince her to talk them into it, and to work on my relationship with her since she engages in parental alienation (and that is something we have been to court for and my husband has spoken to his ex about) and make it so the kids would feel like they can be close to me and can be excited for a baby sibling. Over and over they said I should have done more to get them in the photos or cancelled. My husband was not home at the time. I felt bad enough. There was some guilt for me for not having them in any. I would have loved some photos with them. But I also don't want to need to force it either and have them angry at being forced. My husband was so unhappy with his parents when he got home and I told them. They told him I was the one who decided photos were more important than being a good mom to our older children. I told them I was not Jake and Sophie's mom and as much as I love them, I don't think I will ever be a woman they consider a mom figure. Jake and Sophie heard their grandparents and said I am not their mom and why would they ever be in the stupid photos.\n\nThe day after my ILs sent me texts about it and I asked them to please understand that I would have loved them in the photos.

Canceling if the older kids refused to participate could easily have felt like an attempted guilt trip. Plus, if the kids heard your conversation with the in laws, they heard you standing up for them and respecting their boundaries. \n\nAbout the only thing I'd suggest, if you haven't done this already, is tell the kids that you'll make arrangements to do photos with them if they change their minds in the future. All they need to do is tell you if they decide they do want some bump/baby photos with you. \n\nParental alienation is hell on children, but those children will likely grow up and begin seeing for themselves who was safe and supportive to them and who wasn't. Right now they're being pulled between adults who should be caring for them, and have very little control over their situation. If you have the capacity, it can be incredibly powerful for these kids to have someone who gives them back some sense of control, respect, and stability.

Hubby needs to take on the job of setting boundaries with his parents and keep on setting those boundaries and keep on until that job gets done.  Congratulations on your pregnancy.  May all go well.", "NTA and good stepparenting is meeting kids where they are.", "I feel like the ILs just don\u2019t want OP to have these pictures. They want the kids in them, or the shoot cancelled and the kids don\u2019t want to be in them\u2026,", "Because they want a free professional photo of the step kids.", "NTA. I would be very concerned about exposing my child to someone like them, if I was in your place. NC is the only way, they have repeatedly rebuked you for something that you are blameless of. Unfortunately, you may not realize it now but you are being groomed by this abusive behavior for always being careful to include stepchildren in future activities whether they like it or not.", "NTA", "NTA you asked, they said no it\u2019s that simple you can\u2019t force them to want a relationship with you it\u2019s that simple and if they don\u2019t, it is what it is I wouldn\u2019t feel bad", "NTA at all. I think it was nice for you to give the kids the option. They declined. End of story. ILs need to back off.", "It\u2019s so great you are respecting the kids\u2019 boundaries and letting them warm up to you naturally.\n\nForcing them the way the way these folks are demanding doesn\u2019t respect the kids or their needs at all, and it fosters resentment. \n\nNTA", "This.  Jeez. What is wrong with the damn in laws?", "Tbf a lot of maternity shoots include the other kids as well and it can be incredibly tasteful and lovely.\n\nHowever it's not required.", "NTA - they didn't want to do it. In laws interfering where they aren't wanted", "NTA. Your in-laws have no respect for you or their grandkids. It is amazing they think your photos are even any of their business.", "INFO Can you think of a better way to alienate your stepkids than denying their feelings and forcing them to participate in events that they clearly declined?", "Why are the in laws even involved in this. A maternity photoshoot is for the parents alone and nobody else needs to be involved or even informed.\n\nThey're too in your business but are you sharing too much of your business with them? If they don't know about it, they can't comment. \n\nLearn to share less if you don't want their opinions. Some things are just for you and your husband. Especially with a baby on the way, start learning to keep your own counsel.", "From what I've read on this sub, it seems to be a well known fact that new step parents forcing their step children to do things they are viscerally resistant to works out well for all concerned.\n\nYou gave them the opportunity to join in, they declined, you did not force them and they saw that you are willing to respect their feelings. While they may never consider you their mum, they may at least learn to respect you as a valuable part of their lives.\n\nNTA despite your IL's absurd protestations.\n\nKeep an eye, and ear, out for any interference from your ILs as far as your step kids are concerned though. They may try to force a relationship on the kids that they are not willing to accept."]}
