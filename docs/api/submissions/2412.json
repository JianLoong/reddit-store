Jane and her kids visit often so my husband keeps toys around for them. A short while ago my husband got me some Meemeows. My cat Chewie decided that she really, really liked one of them and the fuzzy brat commandeered it as her pillow. If you move it from her usual spot on the couch where I like to sit for work, she carries it back.\n\nJane was visiting with Jill. My husband and I were both home and I was sitting on the couch doing some work. Chewie was next to me on the couch with her Meemeow pillow snoozing away. Jill came up and asked if I would move Chewie so she could get the plush. I told her no and explained that the plush was Chewie's and it would be mean to take it from her, especially while she was napping. I told her there were some new toys in the box my husband keeps around and look in there for something. I got up to get a drink and some papers from my bag and Jill walked by me hiding the plush behind her. I took it from her and reminded her I said no and she needed to listen and leave Chewie alone. I put it back next to Chewie and went back to work. Couple of minutes later Jane came into the living room demanding to know why I took a toy away from Jill because \"It's a cat, not a human, and toys aren't pillows.\"\n\nI thanked her for revealing my cat was not actually a human despite her acting otherwise and I was forever grateful for her pointing out the difference but the fact remained, I told Jill no and to leave the cat's things alone and she didn't listen. Somehow that has snowballed into Jane and my husband's brother suggesting that another family member host dinner next week so the \"human kids won't take backseat to an animal\".\n\nMy husband is on my side but I'm kind of questioning if I should had just let Jill have the dang plushie for an afternoon or not.

In other words a spoiled brat. If she can\u2019t respect your rules then she shouldn\u2019t be allowed over because this will only get worse.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with the toy belonging to the cat. It has everything to do with teaching you niece to listen to directions and respect rules set by adults.", "I skipped over Jill's age - I thought your were talking about child aged about 2 - 3 years old.  But Jill is 8 - at that age she knows full well about property ownership, following rules, etc.  If Jill is stealing your cat's toys after being told to leave them alone, she is doing this maliciously.  And your BIL's and SIL's reactions shows why: Jill is being raised without adequate boundaries, to be an AH, like her parents.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But I would definitely agree that someone else gets to host family dinner to give yourself a break from the entitled SIL. An 8yo should be able to follow a basic, \u201cthat\u2019s not yours, please leave it alone\u201d at someone else\u2019s house. And if they need a reminder, their parent should be the one to step in and reinforce it instead of whining even louder.", "NTA.   In addition to the valid points raised by OP, since everyone agrees the cat isn't human (LOL) maybe everyone could stop and think that it might not be such a good idea to allow a child to play with a toy that no doubt is saturated in cat saliva.", "NTA.  You were setting a boundary for your pet.  Jill already ignored you saying no and did something anyway, so letting her have it after that would be teaching her that she doesn't have to take no as an answer.  Also it's not like you were neglecting a child's actual needs for the sake of your cat, so the whole \"human kids taking backseat to an animal\" thing is overly dramatic.", "NTA because kids and pets sharing toys doesn't seem the least bit hygienic, you may well have saved your niece from getting sick.", "NTA for sure - my cat cuddles with & carries around a tsum tsum so this hits close to home. But on a serious note, if we frame this differently, they are mad that you have something that belongs to you & means a lot to you (due to its importance to your cat), and didn\u2019t instantly give it to their child the moment she asked. As others have said, this is doing nothing but teaching the kid that boundaries aren\u2019t worth respecting.", "NTA \n\n\nI'd tell your husband to stop buying them toys to play with at your home and get rid of the one you have.\n\n\nThey are raising an entitled brat.  Actions have consequences.  If they want their kid to be able to play with toys in other people's homes then maybe they should bring their own.  If his 8 year old niece can't appreciate the toys that are given, then she doesn't get any.", "NTA.  You said no and that should have been the end of it.", "NTA Kids sometimes want things that are not theirs. It doesn't mean they are entitled to get what they want. \n\nI want some cat tax with the pillow though.", "NTA - It doesn't matter WHY you said no, you said no. Your possession, in your house, means you get the final say. This is not about whether the cat or the child deserves the toy more. It is about respecting other people's possessions and not taking things that are not yours.", "NTA. You established a boundary and your niece didn\u2019t listen. End of story. You also offered her other options through the toy box. Frankly your family members reactions are surprising.", "So I came to this post ready to say Y T A because I assumed from your title that you basically snatched a toy away from a toddler to give to your cat without any explanation.\n\nYou clearly explained to this 8 year old child that the toy belonged to the cat, they are toys your husband paid for so they belong to you, the child listened and acknowledged what you said and then tried to steal the toy anyway and hide it (so she knew what she did was wrong), and then somehow *you* are wrong for taking it back?\n\nNTA, and you should take all the toys and give them to your cat. Your SIL is the biggest AH here. I feel bad for Jill because she is growing up in a household with no consequences or boundaries!", "NTA. \n\nDon't take someone else's stuff is easy enough for an 8 year old to grasp - even if that someone else is a cat.", "OP is right, the bottom line is she told the girl \u201cno\u201d and she didn\u2019t listen. Doesn\u2019t matter why or what about, she said \u201cno\u201d. Kid needs to respect people saying \u201cno\u201d , and entitled parent needs to respect people telling her kid \u201cno\u201d. And not saying this was the case at all with this particular post, but it is good practice to teach kids not to touch any toys or food that belongs to pets/animals. God forbid she tries to take a toy away from a territorial pet and gets scratched or bitten. NTA.", "NTA.  Chewie has chewed it, slobbered on it, slept on it.  The thing is a cat toy now.   Kids aren't entitled to everything they want.  if you had instead said no because it is MY prized collectible, they would have still complained.  Fact is it wasn't for Jane, period.", "NTA\n\nYour niece took correction better than your SIL and BIL.", "NTA - who wants to play with a cat toy anyway?", "NTA,  \nChildren and in your case, a \"mom\", needs to learn that no means no.", "NTA\n\nYou told the child \u201cNo\u201d and she took it anyway.

Regardless of who it belonged to (cat or human), the toy wasn't hers. You explained nicely and told no. She should understand what \"no\" means, to not take things she doesn't own. Instead she tried to sneak around and get her way. Her mother enabling her daughter and confronting you, turning it into a big drama is an AH move.\n\nI want to adress that she took the toy from a sleeping cat, I think this behaviour (disturb a sleeping animal) lacks empathy. (Though some small kids roughhouse their pets or animals they encounter, whenever they see one sleeping, from what I've witnessed they get quiet and be like \"shh it's sleeping let's not disturb it\") And her mother's words \"it's a cat, not a human\" shows where she probably gets that from.", "Nta she 8. Waaaaay old enough to be told 'no' and not throw a tantrum.", "NTA.  Somebody has to teach the child about boundaries because it looks like her parents won't.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know when there began a generation of parents who have decided that their precious angels should never be told no, but they're out there in depressingly large numbers. \n\nWhile I don't advocate a return to the days of \"no, because I said so, now go be quiet\", sometimes the answer is no, plain and simple. Even if the kid doesn't like the reason, that's not enough to change the answer. \n\nYou explained the reason to Jill, you redirected her to a box of other toys she could choose from, and when she took the toy anyway - you calmly took it away from her while reinforcing what you said earlier. \n\nThat Jane has equated this to a grievous malfeasance done unto her daughter is on Jane to deal with, though also unfortunately right now on you to have to deal with Jane's whining about it. Ignore it. She's trying to make you feel bad and/or make you feel like you need to justify setting a very reasonable boundary because apparently - due to her own parenting - her daughter doesn't know how to deal with them. That's not on you.", "NTA\n\nYou correctly handled the situation and also turned it into a parenting moment about boundaries, which clearly Jill would benefit from given her parents' reaction to what happened. They're 100% overreacting.", "NTA. You were reasonable and explained why Jill couldn\u2019t take the toy and offered an alternative to redirect her focus. That should\u2019ve been it, end of discussion.", "It\u2019s a cat toy. If I was their parent I\u2019d be taking it away from my kid asap, not giving it to them. The cats had it in their mouth and it\u2019s probably covered in fur/dander. \n\nThis shouldn\u2019t even be a question, NTA.", "NTA, \nParents should have done what you did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
