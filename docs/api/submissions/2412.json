My cat Chewie decided that she really, really liked one of them and the fuzzy brat commandeered it as her pillow. If you move it from her usual spot on the couch where I like to sit for work, she carries it back.\n\nJane was visiting with Jill. My husband and I were both home and I was sitting on the couch doing some work. Chewie was next to me on the couch with her Meemeow pillow snoozing away. Jill came up and asked if I would move Chewie so she could get the plush. I told her no and explained that the plush was Chewie's and it would be mean to take it from her, especially while she was napping. I told her there were some new toys in the box my husband keeps around and look in there for something. I got up to get a drink and some papers from my bag and Jill walked by me hiding the plush behind her. I took it from her and reminded her I said no and she needed to listen and leave Chewie alone. I put it back next to Chewie and went back to work. Couple of minutes later Jane came into the living room demanding to know why I took a toy away from Jill because \"It's a cat, not a human, and toys aren't pillows.\"\n\nI thanked her for revealing my cat was not actually a human despite her acting otherwise and I was forever grateful for her pointing out the difference but the fact remained, I told Jill no and to leave the cat's things alone and she didn't listen.

This has nothing to do with the toy belonging to the cat. It has everything to do with teaching you niece to listen to directions and respect rules set by adults.", "I skipped over Jill's age - I thought your were talking about child aged about 2 - 3 years old.  But Jill is 8 - at that age she knows full well about property ownership, following rules, etc.  If Jill is stealing your cat's toys after being told to leave them alone, she is doing this maliciously.

You were setting a boundary for your pet.  Jill already ignored you saying no and did something anyway, so letting her have it after that would be teaching her that she doesn't have to take no as an answer.  Also it's not like you were neglecting a child's actual needs for the sake of your cat, so the whole \"human kids taking backseat to an animal\" thing is overly dramatic.", "NTA because kids and pets sharing toys doesn't seem the least bit hygienic, you may well have saved your niece from getting sick.", "NTA for sure - my cat cuddles with & carries around a tsum tsum so this hits close to home. But on a serious note, if we frame this differently, they are mad that you have something that belongs to you & means a lot to you (due to its importance to your cat), and didn\u2019t instantly give it to their child the moment she asked.

Your SIL is the biggest AH here.

(Though some small kids roughhouse their pets or animals they encounter, whenever they see one sleeping, from what I've witnessed they get quiet and be like \"shh it's sleeping let's not disturb it\") And her mother's words \"it's a cat, not a human\" shows where she probably gets that from.", "Nta she 8.

Even if the kid doesn't like the reason, that's not enough to change the answer. \n\nYou explained the reason to Jill, you redirected her to a box of other toys she could choose from, and when she took the toy anyway - you calmly took it away from her while reinforcing what you said earlier. \n\nThat Jane has equated this to a grievous malfeasance done unto her daughter is on Jane to deal with, though also unfortunately right now on you to have to deal with Jane's whining about it. Ignore it. She's trying to make you feel bad and/or make you feel like you need to justify setting a very reasonable boundary because apparently - due to her own parenting - her daughter doesn't know how to deal with them. That's not on you.", "NTA\n\nYou correctly handled the situation and also turned it into a parenting moment about boundaries, which clearly Jill would benefit from given her parents' reaction to what happened.
