I told her no and explained that the plush was Chewie's and it would be mean to take it from her, especially while she was napping. I told her there were some new toys in the box my husband keeps around and look in there for something. I got up to get a drink and some papers from my bag and Jill walked by me hiding the plush behind her. I took it from her and reminded her I said no and she needed to listen and leave Chewie alone.

In other words a spoiled brat. If she can\u2019t respect your rules then she shouldn\u2019t be allowed over because this will only get worse.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with the toy belonging to the cat. It has everything to do with teaching you niece to listen to directions and respect rules set by adults.", "I skipped over Jill's age - I thought your were talking about child aged about 2 - 3 years old.  But Jill is 8 - at that age she knows full well about property ownership, following rules, etc.  If Jill is stealing your cat's toys after being told to leave them alone, she is doing this maliciously.  And your BIL's and SIL's reactions shows why: Jill is being raised without adequate boundaries, to be an AH, like her parents.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

An 8yo should be able to follow a basic, \u201cthat\u2019s not yours, please leave it alone\u201d at someone else\u2019s house.

In addition to the valid points raised by OP, since everyone agrees the cat isn't human (LOL) maybe everyone could stop and think that it might not be such a good idea to allow a child to play with a toy that no doubt is saturated in cat saliva.", "NTA.  You were setting a boundary for your pet.  Jill already ignored you saying no and did something anyway, so letting her have it after that would be teaching her that she doesn't have to take no as an answer.  Also it's not like you were neglecting a child's actual needs for the sake of your cat, so the whole \"human kids taking backseat to an animal\" thing is overly dramatic.", "NTA because kids and pets sharing toys doesn't seem the least bit hygienic, you may well have saved your niece from getting sick.", "NTA for sure - my cat cuddles with & carries around a tsum tsum so this hits close to home. But on a serious note, if we frame this differently, they are mad that you have something that belongs to you & means a lot to you (due to its importance to your cat), and didn\u2019t instantly give it to their child the moment she asked.

Your SIL is the biggest AH here.

(Though some small kids roughhouse their pets or animals they encounter, whenever they see one sleeping, from what I've witnessed they get quiet and be like \"shh it's sleeping let's not disturb it\") And her mother's words \"it's a cat, not a human\" shows where she probably gets that from.", "Nta she 8.

Somebody has to teach the child about boundaries because it looks like her parents won't.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know when there began a generation of parents who have decided that their precious angels should never be told no, but they're out there in depressingly large numbers. \n\nWhile I don't advocate a return to the days of \"no, because I said so, now go be quiet\", sometimes the answer is no, plain and simple. Even if the kid doesn't like the reason, that's not enough to change the answer. \n\nYou explained the reason to Jill, you redirected her to a box of other toys she could choose from, and when she took the toy anyway - you calmly took it away from her while reinforcing what you said earlier. \n\nThat Jane has equated this to a grievous malfeasance done unto her daughter is on Jane to deal with, though also unfortunately right now on you to have to deal with Jane's whining about it. Ignore it. She's trying to make you feel bad and/or make you feel like you need to justify setting a very reasonable boundary because apparently - due to her own parenting - her daughter doesn't know how to deal with them. That's not on you.", "NTA\n\nYou correctly handled the situation and also turned it into a parenting moment about boundaries, which clearly Jill would benefit from given her parents' reaction to what happened.
