You cannot possibly consider yourself Maddy's \"friend\". What you said was absolutely uncalled for. \"I'm incredibly blunt\" is an excuse used by a lot of assholes when they inevitably piss people off.

Good for her boyfriend for calling you out,  you absolutely deserved that.", "YTA.

Her weight is not responsible for his mental health issues. \n\nYou also seem convinced her boyfriend finds self-validation through having an attractive partner. Not only is this creepily gross and shallow, it may surprise you to hear that not everyone agrees on what makes someone attractive.\n\nHave you considered trying empathy at all?

I don't even really know where to start with this one, and to be frank, I'm disappointed that anyone is siding with you.\n\nTo make the assumption that someone's mental health struggles may be due to someone else's weight is just...disgusting! Your attitude towards your friend is awful. You are certainly no friend of hers. You took your negative opinions and views on weight and projected them on to her, essentially blaming her for her boyfriends problems. That's just so incredibly twisted and cruel.
