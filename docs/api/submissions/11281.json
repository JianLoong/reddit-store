You have assholes for friends too.", "Maddy probably isn\u2019t as overweight as OP makes it seem you know since society holds impossible beauty and weight standards and OP is a dick (as well as half the group who sided with him) like my guy YTA in every possible way", "YTA, the first normal reaction to what she described about her BF is to be concerned for his mental health, he sounds depressed, not he must be feeling down because you're an ugly fatass. By the sounds of it you and half your friends are judgemental shallow arseholes who possibly have a thing for her BF, do the other half of your friends a favour by taking your half and fucking off from their lives", "Wow, YTA to the max. \n\nThe issue is that *he* can\u2019t leave the house, can\u2019t get up the motivation for a lot of things, including to eat himself. This is clearly an issue of his own mental health struggling, which has absolutely nothing to do with Maddy\u2019s weight. Whatever discussion about their joint health they want to have is between the two of them, not you. I\u2019m not surprised at all that both of them cussed you out.", "YTA", "YTA, is this real? You are rude, inappropriate and what Maddy's bf said to you was absolutely justified  (it is obviously not intended to be taken literally, no-one thinks you should feed yourself and actually die from eating poo).", "YTA.\n\nThis is giving strong \u201cI\u2019m repulsed at myself for having feelings/being attracted towards you, so I\u2019m going to neg you hoping you\u2019ll eventually fit my internalized problematic ideals and I can give myself permission to hit on you\u201d vibes.", ">I told her that now might be a good motivation to lose weight and better her beauty...\n\nGrosss!!! YTA\n\nAs a literature and journalism major, I still cannot explain how I am disgusted with this sentence...", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry to be the one to have to tell you this Champ, but sometimes penises don\u2019t work even when offered a skinny chic.", "YTA and I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t know what the meaning of the word \u201cfriend\u201d is if you can treat one of them this way.", "Do exactly what he said. Yta. You will never not be. You\u2019re a dick. No way around it", "YTA. She's not responsible for her boyfriend's depression just by being fat. If lack of attraction were the issue, he could just break up with her. I'm assuming she was fat when he started dating her, right? This isn't a new thing that she ambushed him with?", "What gets me is that OP states that Maddie\u2019s BF was with her while she is the weight she is. So it obviously has NOTHING to do with that. You\u2019re a real AH OP. And you and your self-centered little friends that think everything is about weight won\u2019t be happy until you realize love is so much more than what someone looks like.", "Guy sounds depressed and you say he's fine and tell her she's fat?? \n\nLike she doesn't already know? \n\nI second her boyfriends sentiment \n\nYTA", "So what the bf told you was too much, but you telling your \u201cfriend\u201d being unattractive and overweight is the cause of her bfs mental health problems is perfectly in line? Being \u201cblunt\u201d is not an excuse for being a cruel person. YTA", "YTA. Her boyfriend was right, and what he said was absolutely justified. You are not Maddy\u2019s friend at all and neither is anyone on your side. You don\u2019t respect or even like her or you never would have been so cruel and blamed her for her boyfriend\u2019s problems, and seem to think because you don\u2019t find her attractive she doesn\u2019t deserve love. You should do her a favor and stay out of her life.", "Yta, so you decided to take it on yourself, cause you're \"incredibly blunt\", aka you use it as an excuse to be rude, and told someone in no simple tm terms,\n\n\"You so fat, that you're causing your bf physical and mental issues. Maybe if you weren't so fat, he'd act normal\"\n\nThen wonder why people got upset at you?", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have been quite as blunt as that but Maddy should not, under any circumstances, be sharing those types of intimate details with you especially if she doesn\u2019t have his permission. ED is not something you should tell people out with the relationship.", "INFO: Has Maddy piled on the pounds recently or was she fat when the relationship started?", "YTA, and so are any of the \"friends\" that are on your side. \"Being blunt\" does not give you an excuse to say whatever is on your mind at any time. You are transferring your own opinions on Maddy's boyfriend. How TF would you actually know what's going on between them?", "YTA, you told her she's unattractive under the guise of blaming her boyfriend. Of course he told you that, you put words into his mouth so you could pretend to just be \"truthful\". You're an asshole, and so are your other friends who think the boyfriend made a mistake dating her to begin with. You all sound awful.", "You\u2019re one of those \u201cbrutally honest\u201d arseholes that\u2019s more concerned with brutality than honesty aren\u2019t you?", "You're 200% TA. I really don't know how anyone would be friends with you to begin with. Just being blunt.", "YTA what the fuck makes you think you\u2019re not? \u201cYou\u2019re fat, lose weight and your BF will be happier\u201d are you even her friend?!\n\nMy partner has ED and it\u2019s through medical issues, not my fucking weight, I\u2019d be absolutely LIVID if someone said this to Me", "What year is it that we\u2019re still telling women to lose weight for a man??? YTA.", "Yeah that and the whole I dont get why her bf is with her anyway op is definitely not maddys friend no friend would treat her this way", "You don\u2019t understand. Men can be cured of any illness if their GF are thinner. /s", "Also the absolutely RIDICULOUS suggestion that her bfs depression which is stopping him GOING OUTSIDE is because his gf is overweight. Talk about making women responsible for men's problems. What an absolutely insane suggestion", "Why did Mr \"tell it like it is\" get his fragile little feelings hurt when the boyfriend was blunt with him?", "OP totally glosses over that the bf feels unable to go outside, work, or hang out with friends. None of these have anything to do with Maddy's weight. Instead of noticing clear signs of bf depression, OP decides to call Maddy fat.", "Thank you for calling out his \"I'm incredibly blunt\" statement for what it is. So many AHs like to trot out that line as if it gives them a free pass for bad behavior and then they get all \"Pikachu shocked\" when they come across consequences for it like OP did. \n\nAnd OP: To be blunt, YTA. And to be even more blunt it's sad you needed reddit to tell you that.", "It also makes zero sense that the reason the bf finds it difficult to go outside and interact Dutch friends is because his girlfriend is overweight. Those things have no correlation whatsoever. OP just wanted a chance to perpetuate the incredibly sexist idea that a woman\u2019s attractiveness will automatically make a man\u2019s life happy", "I'm blunt. I've been told this many times. And I will fully admit that when I was younger being told that was usually followed by a conversation on how important tone is / how our words can unknowingly impact others. That being said as an adult I've never heard it in response to me being an asshole. I feel like assholes try to use being blunt as an excuse to be a dick to others, while those of us who actually are still care about the impact our words have. At this pt in my life most of my bluntness comes out in compliments or helpful ways.", "Maybe but I\u2019ve known guys like this.", "Actually the last line of him getting all upset is what makes me think it's real. But then this is reddit...", "What the BF wasn't too much. He was just being incredibly blunt", "I second this , YTA", "OP is a dude.", "I agree with you but I think in this context (gf citing lack of affection and not having sex), ED means erectile dysfunction.", "[removed]", "My cancer disappeared when my wife lost 15 lbs!", "Why would you, as a friend, also say that someone is fat and unattractive?? \n\nI mean, of course we can cure mental health issue by having our partner lose weight and get dolled up!!  Good grief. \n\nYou are a horrible friend, OP. Talking to someone that way is not blunt, it is mean. There is clearly something missing in your own life for you to behave this way towards others.", "Exactly! How can you blame her for not being pretty enough is making her boyfriend have a mental health crisis. That's fucked", "Same you can be blunt and have some tact and social consideration.", "You can tell what kind of \"I'm always blunt!!\" person this is by the fact that he seemed to get super upset and hurt by Maddy's bf being equally blunt.", "\"just telling it like it is\" the battle cry of assholes!", "The pivot from \u201cI tell it like it is\u201d to \u201cthat was uncalled for\u201d gave me whiplash.", "And I also think he's attracted to Maddy, but wouldn't date her in front of his shallow friends at this point. So he's hoping they break up and that she gets thin so OP can swoop in. Big niceguys energy.", "BF was just telling it like it is.", "OP is a he, btw.", "Oh, excuse me.\n\nAh yes, the good ole \"skinny boy surrounds himself with people he considers more unattractive than him because he has a garbage personality\" trope.\n\nFreaking love that her boyfriend told him to eat shit. Should be a familiar taste considering how many asses he's been up.", "[removed]", "Hey buddy, newsflash: just because you don't want to sleep with her, doesn't mean that any and every problem in her life would be solved by her changing herself so that you find her attractive.\n\nYou are not her friend. And you're not \"incredibly blunt\", you're just a cruel asshole. Sort yourself out.", "Sounds like a nice group of \"friends\" when they ponder why her boyfriend would date her in the first place.", "Definitely! Like not everything has to be sugar-coated, but it doesn\u2019t have to be morphed into straight-up savagery, either.", "Exactly!", "This! Whenever I hear someone describe themselves as \"blunt\" I know they are bullies. They can dish it out but they can't take it.", "It isn't \"how it is\" anyway. Maddy hasn't changed since they started dating, but her boyfriend has. It's obvious that this is completely unrelated. Not blunt, just idiotic.", "Blunt is fine when it is coming out of kind lips - not when it is spewing from someone's ass!", "It's always ironic when the most blunt tool becomes as fragile as glass when one is used against them.", "My bad but still... my husband would definitely have said something WAY worse than that.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I think he does want to sleep with her but is disgusted with himself for that, and if she was palatably attractive to him he\u2019d feel better. He\u2019s a total dick either way though and she\u2019s much better off without him in her life.", "It\u2019s a particular skill exclusive to complete assholes\nthat they can be both blunt and idiotic at the same time. YTA of course.", "Oh my husband would have given OP a serious tongue lashing.
