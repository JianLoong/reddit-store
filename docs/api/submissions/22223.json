Why not just take your ex to court and get things set in place so that he has to pay child support and set up an actual custody agreement or apply for sole custody?", "YTA. What do you hope to accomplish? Putting your spiteful vindictive nature on show despite being \u201cover it\u201d? If this venue goes about any kind of vetting process for exhibition applications, good luck getting accepted. \n\nWhat do you plan to tell your son? Mommy\u2019s making spiteful art instead of taking daddy to court to get a better custody and child support arrangement? \n\nAlso, starting a business does take up a lot of tike and energy. Yeah, it sucks that you and your kid are in the middle of it but that\u2019s the reality.", "YTA. The title comes across as very smug and self-righteous. Only you are going to know the inside joke, to others, it could be viewed as a slam on parents who are legitimately busy (parents on shift work, away for work, in the military, et al). You're pointing out all that you accomplished while being a parent, when for some, our biggest accomplishment at the end of the day is the house is  still standing, the dog isn't on fire and the kids are all accounted for.\n\nI'd rethink the title of show however,  there's nothing preventing you from coming up with some witty, pointed titles for the individual pieces.", "NTA. This might not lead to your ex being a better parent but if it makes you feel better, go for it!", "YTA. And the irony of exhibiting art that\u2019s centered around \u201cyou\u2019re not too busy to be a parent\u201d exhibition is that you\u2019re taking time away from being with your son to make this art. You\u2019re also being a bad mother by modeling this level of petty revenge for your son. Be a better mother.", "NTA\n\nHe is failing seriously with is parental duties. However, don't be surprise he blow out on you.", "This is pointless and stupid. You've got far better ways to spend your time than making that much revenge art.\n\nYou said you're doing being annoyed by any of this? Then BE done with it. No matter what you're going to do, your ex will not contribute his time nor his effort. Ever. So, take his relation with his son and his money instead. Take your ex to court. Get full custody, and have your ex pay his dues in money.\n\nAnd spend that time you'd otherwise spend on making revenge-art with your son. Because, believe me, no matter how angry, frustrated and hurt your feel... Your son's suffering ten times worse. Get your priorities straight.\n\nYTA", "YTA but that wouldn't stop me from showing up to sip some wine and watch the drama unfold because I like to watch things burn.\n\nBut seriously, I would worry about negative ramifications for my kid, and probably NOT do this.  Part of your local art community will find it cringe and part may love it - I'm not sure it's a good professional move for you either.", "NTA\n\n It's maybe a little petty, but you're entitled to feel like this.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with the idea, but it won\u2019t get him to change or get you financial help with you son. Getting court-ordered child support is the best idea.", "It will also look like parent alienation. Showing that OP is willing to talk bad about their ex. It won't look good in court if the ex is vindictive.", "Yeah, I don't think the idea is terrible, but it sounds like the outcome of this is more so vindication for how OP feels, which is fair, but if ultimately the point is to help and get help for her son, it would seem going to court and actually taking action would be more beneficial."]}
