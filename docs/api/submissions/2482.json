But I don't think it is that simple. Since you both are married I hope he wants your kid to be happy, as well as you want his to be happy. While it is not a bad idea to split finance, this splitting leads to a behavior that you hopefully don't want in your daughters and that is this competitive thinking or superior thinking. Of course they will compare their gifts, especially if they are both the same thing (here: cars), they are 16 years old.\n\nSo I think he is also \"TA\" for treating his daughter better in this case. Maybe not TA, but he could have handled the situation better.\n\nMaybe here it would have been better to say: we are going to give you x amount of money, that is enough to buy a car, if you want a better one we can see what we do. Maybe the daughter's can use some of theirs, or you make a deal and say you get more, but on Christmas is going to be less under the tree.\nIn the future you may update your agreement to fixate on a cost for gifts that is affordable to you both.

Getting a free car at 16 that they didn't have to work for and crying because it isn't new is a red flag that you have spoiled children. Quit acting like you deserved his money for your daughter, tell your daughter to be grateful for what she has or u will take it back and sell it. Ignore your husband's princess.

She should be humble.\n\nYour daughter for not understanding you did the best you could and her stepsister has a different financial situation. He\u2019s not her dad and (I hope) she knows the finances are split. Having a car is something a lot of people dream of.\nMy best friend in high school her family lost a TON of money. We\u2019re talking millions. She ended up tutoring kids and bought her own little beater that she loved. And she didn\u2019t begrudge anyone their swanky car in our well off area.

OP agreed to a set-up guaranteed to unequal treatment, and I\u2019m confident this is not the first time something like this has happened. Finances are separate, both parties agreed to take responsibility for only their child, and while OP\u2019s daughter feels slighted, when comparing her wheels to her stepsisters, this was bound to happen.\n\nAnd this is a sincere question: why did you and your husband choose to marry and become a household, especially when your daughters are treated differently from one another?", "~~i mean, yes, YTA for trying to go back on an arrangement you previously agreed to because it's no longer convenient for you.~~\n\nmore importantly though, i think the arrangement as a whole is a recipe for disaster and probably not a great way to blend your family. i understand having split finances, but your daughters are both teenage girls, they will feel resentment (towards you, your husband, and each other) for what they perceive as unequal treatment.\n\nit's unclear what your financial situation is\u2013whether you and your husband make the around the same amount, whether he saved to buy the car outright or is paying the monthly installments on it, etc\u2013but either way, i can imagine this causing even more problems in the future. what happens when it's time for them to go to college, and your husband can afford to cover the tuition of a more expensive school than you can for your daughter? what if they both move out and later need help with expenses, but your husband can help his daughter and you can't help yours? blending families successfully is hard enough as it is, i can't imagine this financial arrangement is going to help much down the line.\n\nETA: i read your other comments and it seems like this arrangement was his idea, and you make less money than him. ESH (except the daughters) - him for coming up with this arrangement, you for agreeing to it without any foresight on how it would affect you or your daughter's lifestyles, for all the reasons i listed above. \n\nultimately, your daughter doesn't \\*need\\* a car, and because of the arrangement, he is not obligated to get his daughter a cheaper car to help you get your daughter one. if he wants to spoil his daughter with his money, and absolutely refused to help contribute financially to your daughter, that's technically within his right, though i personally think it is a MAJOR red flag when blending families. if i were you, i would've reconsidered marrying him, at least for your daughter's sake, but its too late now. her resentment for her stepdad, stepsister, and YOU will only continue to grow as this continues.", "I don't know how you have seperate finances for kids.

It is not a simple yes or no.", "YTA. You agreed to marry him with this financial arrangement. If you felt it was unfair, imbalanced, or impractical, the time to call that out was before you walked down the aisle.

But a lot of comments are ignoring that agreeing to split finances doesn\u2019t mean there are no familial considerations to be made. Your husband didn\u2019t have to loan you the money, fine. But he definitely needed to consider what problems would arise between the girls who are forced to cohabitate by allowing one to get a cheap second-hand car and the other a brand new car.

I see that you are a much lower earner than your spouse and sometimes things you previously agree on financially just don\u2019t work out in practice. Was it your idea or his to keep the finances separate? I\u2019m guessing his. Ultimately I think it\u2019s not fair for two daughters who presumably both live at home to have such different qualities of life. This is a recipe for Anya resenting Luna and her stepdad and you resenting your spouse for the sake of your child. I also think it sucks in a marriage for anyone to make a big ticket purchase without consulting the other one even if their finances are somewhat separate (and it can\u2019t be totally separate if you live together). Ultimately Anya is going to finish out her young adulthood feeling like a second class citizen in her own home and I think you\u2019re only right to be concerned about your child\u2019s feelings.

Folks we don\u2019t know how much either of the parents make in the topic. If they make several hundred thousand a year or more a $20k car really isn\u2019t a big expense. \n\n2) OP sounds like they want split finances (for whatever reason) but didn\u2019t realize/factor in for some odd reason that obviously the husband makes way more money. This is why she feels like the AH to me because only have realizing does she want to change the strategy. Cant\u2019 have it both ways.\n\n3) personaly I don\u2019t get split finances. I know plenty of couples do it but I don\u2019t see how that works fairly nor can you do sound financial planning without tons of communication.
