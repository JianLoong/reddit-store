Lol I just think that when you have two 16yo girls, maybe it\u2019s worth more of a convo? Not that he owed OP or Anya any leeway or money or that Luna shouldn\u2019t have gotten the car she did. But that partner to partner, they could have been on the same page prior to daughters being aware of the situation.  \n\nI\u2019m also a huge \u201cwhy\u201d person, I\u2019m neurodivergent and sometimes a little elaboration helps me to understand someone\u2019s position more deeply!", "Then it seems fair that each of you are responsible for your own child.\nYTA", "So it appears that your incomes are being fairly split when it comes to household responsibilities. I\u2019m not sure why you expect him to be paying for your adult child as well.", "Other parents and grandparents can still be asked for help vs the person who pays 75 of expenses and is still able to save more.\n\nAre you also going to pitch a fit when it comes to college and you find that he has been saving and building up a nice college fund but you haven\u2019t saved as much or at all for yours?", "I wonder if providing for their own child means paying for things like education, gifts, trips and so on. Because OP says the husband pays 75% of their expenses, I imagine they don't do the math for what the kids eat or house expenses. So I'm led to believe the husband pays for 75% of gorceries and house expenses, that OP's child benefits from. So, actually, the husband does pay for OP's daughter in some capacity. OP, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong and I'm sorry if I am.", "I don't disagree. But the parent and step parent should ne actively avoiding trying to drive wedges between their kids and their step siblings- for everyone's sanity.\n\nIt's not so much about who is flipping the bill so much as making a child feel lesser.", "Upvote for dragon hoard reference", "Having separate finances was his idea not mine", "Boff \ud83d\ude0e/s", "100% agree with this. Why in gods name would his daughters quality of life suffer because he got married. Should he also make her go to a lower quality college to keep things \u201cfair\u201d?! I\u2019m astounded by the entitlement", "I feel like they were on the same page, \"you finance your daughter and I'll finance mine.\"\n\nAs someone else in the comments here has said, \"well, if it isn't the consequences of your own agreement.\"", "If you go read her comments he told her before they got married he would not be changing any quality of his daughters lifestyle. \n\nBut she really is going to blow a gasket wait until college comes and he sends his child to college debt free and then wait till they get married and his daughter gets a $20,000 dollar wedding while he doesn\u2019t pay for hers.\n\nShe knew this is what she was signing up for. Do i fell sorry for her daughter l? Yes but op knew what she was getting them into. I figure she thought she convince him to change and she could control what he gave his daughter.", "I agree which is why I do not think these types of financial arrangements work.", "Then your issue here is with the fundamental structure of your marriage, not with him buying his daughter a car. If you don't like these terms, speak with him about it and, if he doesn't budge, maybe its time to reevaluate if this is working for you and your daughter.", "Sounds like you have way bigger issues that just the cars you got your respective kids, then. It also sounds like you could stand to take the rose-colored glasses off and have an honest look at your relationship and how happy you are in it.\n\nETA: I've seen more of your comments now and while it's not the greatest situation for your daughter, it is the one that you signed both of you up for. \n\nShe is not his child, so your expectation that he be willing to help when needed is not realistic when he has made it abundantly clear that that is not how he will act. YTA.", "...one that you agreed to?", "Fair enough. Different relationship, different expectations I guess!\n\nEdit to also say:  never said OP wasn\u2019t TA, just that husband *could* have explained during the initial convo that he couldnt afford to lend her money bc he was buying his daughter a new car. I also mentioned in my first comment that OP agreed to this", "Giving her expectation that the husband would lend the 4k and get his daughter a less expensive car, I think OP tought she could make her husband change his mind as well. Not only a bad decision but also manipulative. And I bet if situations were reversed, OP would not lend the 4k and get her daughter a less expensive car.\n\nEdit:typo", "Sooo\u2026\u2026 not the Iranian yogurt.", "Probably not considering she called her his princess.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how this marriage ends well.", "Lol, precisely!"]}
