Loaning family money is never a good idea especially when clearly she doesn't manage money well.", "> She responded by laughing it off and saying she tries not to think about it.\n\nNTA. There is no reason she can't pay off her own debt. She racked it up, she can pay it down including taking the 25% hit on her savings withdrawal to do it.  That \"hit\" might act as incentive in the future to keep her from getting into this situation again.\n\nIf you give it to her, what's to stop her from racking up more debt before she pays you back? Nothing.\n\nSo in the first scenario - she holds herself accountable for her actions by taking it out of her own savings.\n\nThe second scenario - she's asking YOU to be accountable for HER actions by risking that you won't have access to your own money if you need it.\n\nI wouldn't do it, not under those conditions.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to do the math for us or for her, because that really doesn\u2019t factor in here.

Because she didn't have to make sacrifices and do the work to pay it off the first time, there will be more times because she didn't learn any type of lesson other than she can pay it with your money and you are not someone who she feels she has to pay back and there's no consequences other than you being grumpy if she doesn't. She needs to feel the burn, learn from her mistakes and change her behavior or there's big consequences. It's enabling her and taking money from your hard work and goals.", "NTA, never lend your family money that you aren't prepared to never get back.", "NTA -  \n1. She lied to you about the size of the debt, bad start....  \n2. She'll get into more debt before you see any money  \n3. She's in denial about her money problems  \n4.
