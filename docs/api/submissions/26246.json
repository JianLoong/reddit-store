When I got married, he was busy taking pics of us getting ready and there would have been no time to take pics of anyone else.  But it does seem odd that she wants her pics taken at the same place as where your wedding pics will be.", "There are two questions here:\n\nFirst can your sister hire the photographer at that time? This is between your sister and the photographer. You don't own the photographer.\n\nSecond is your sister free at that time to do a non-wedding personal errand? She is your maid of honor, so it might be a bit cheeky to disappear right before your wedding for a photoshoot.\n\nYou need to ask yourself whether it is important to you to have her there during that time. It is reasonable to not want your wedding to be usurped by other activities. If she was asking to go get some grocery shopping done and you would still say no then the timing is the issue and you are fully justified in saying no.\n\n>not wanting her to have her pictures in the same style on the same place on the same day and with the same make up and hair as my wedding pictures\n\nIf your only concern is that the *photos* will have the same look as your wedding photos them I am less sympathetic. I seriously don't get why it would matter.\n\nTry thinking of it this way: Whenever you see her pregnancy pics you will be reminded of your happy wedding ceremony. Instead of thinking about her photos taking away from your wedding somehow, think of them as another connection to your wedding.\n\nYou can look at them and think \"Boy, I chose a great looking bridesmaid dress!\" or \"Remember that toast she gave at the reception, it was so sweet.\"", "NTA\n\nIf she can afford the photographer, then she can afford her own hair and makeup.\n\nIt seems like she's bogarting your location shoots on top of everything else.\n\nIt's YOUR DAY.\n\nINFO: How far along is she?", "Nta. How will the photographer do the getting ready shots if they've gone? Do you get a discount while they're gone? Do they have neverending storage (I genuinely don't know)? Will the photographer be able to switch mental gears back and forth and think about the theme, etc? Who will be looking after you while your maid of honour is gone?

When my daughter got married 2 years ago, her photographer showed up at the salon where the bride and attendants were getting hair and makeup done.  This was before 11:00.  The wedding (at same venue as reception) was at 2 pm.  There was an outdoor photo session after the hair and makeup, at a different, scenic location, then the wedding, then wedding party went for more outdoor shots at a third location (reception didn\u2019t have an attractive outdoor spot).  These locations were all less than 10 minutes apart, but still\u2026. Then reception pics, cake, dancing, etc., until photographer left at about 5:30.  It was really a full day and I\u2019m doubtful that a wedding photographer would agree to splitting up his or her day.\n\nWe had to pay in advance (final payment on day of)\u2014so if photographer agreed to do sister\u2019s photos, she would most likely have to pay in advance as well.\n\nNevertheless, you look petty and selfish to refuse outright.  My suggestion is that you tell your sister to take it up with the photographer.  Then let the photographer know you\u2019re not in favor.  I\u2019m sure they can find a way to let sis down tactfully.", "NTA tell her to schedule her own special day.", "NTA but just tell her there won\u2019t be time because there won\u2019t be.

Its YOUR wedding. She can have a photoshoot any day. Dont feel selfish, you are the bride !!", "NTA the photographer would also need to take picture of you and your entourage getting ready, are they supposed to just disappear to follow your sister?

You hired a *Wedding* photographer to photograph *your* day. Any length of time he spends doing a personal shoot for someone else is time he's not capturing *your* day. \n\nIt's absolutely fair to say that youre not comfortable with your wedding photographer, at your wedding venue, being used for any other events.  It's also fine not to be ok with a separate photo shoot at your wedding. It'd your day. The MOH is supposed to be focused on you.", "NTA your photographer can't take a \"job\" while she's doing your \"job\". Your photographer would be taki5tine away from taking your pictures to concentrate on your sister. If she's a professional she wouldn't even agree to this.\n\nYour sister's request is like asking if she can get married real quick after your vows. She's trying take advantage of your venue and your preparations.", "NTA As others suggested, contact the photographer and tell them they are not to be hijacked by your sister. She is being lazy in not organising her own day and, I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't pay. Additionally, remember that your package includes a certain amount of photos. Your sister's photos would then be deducted leaving you with less. It's your day.", "I can see this one both ways.  I would say no to a whole photo shoot centered around her but would ask for the photographer to take a handful of photos of just her highlighting her belly. (Like 15 minutes)\n\nNAH/ESH", "NAH YET because this needs to be 100% up to your photographer. You should be the one to discuss this potential request with your photographer and tell her that in no way should she feel obligated to do this AND you want to make sure that if she accepts, it won't be taking any time away from her contracted time shooting your wedding photos. \n\nIf your photographer wants to take the gig and assures you she can do both without compromising quality or time, THEN, YWBTA for saying no to your sister.", "YTA.  My judgement assumes, because you didn\u2019t say otherwise and I think you would have, that this is a doable thing as far as the photographer goes, and would in no way take away their time with you etc.  \n\nYTA because you are ONLY concerned with her hair and makeup being the \u2018same\u2019 as your wedding and it\u2019s pictures.", "YTA\n\nThis seems like such a smart idea to me!  Surely there\u2019s a way to make this work - a different area of the grounds, a different-colour shawl or quick modified hairstyle\u2026 with a good photog and some thought, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t look like she\u2019s leaning away from you at the altar to have these pics taken. \n\nAnd in a year no one will care anyway. \n\nUp to you, but I see no real downside to letting her do this.", "If this were me and my sister, I would honestly find it really cute and special. This does sound selfish. You're entitled to do what you want with your own wedding photographer but kinda TA for this. Plus she's offering to pay for it. \n\nWhy not take advantage of a day where you get all pretty to have your pregnancy photoshoot? Wouldn't it be cute in the future to have kids look back on the pictures and realize \"Hey, this looks so familiar to my mom's wedding pictures...omg!!\" It's not like she's stealing your spotlight in any way. It sounds really selfish and superficial to tell her no just because she has her hair styled a certain way or whatever.", "NAH but I do question your motives for saying no. Not wanting to put the photographer under time pressure is understandable but your reasons sound selfish. Still, it's your wedding.\n\n>after she has her hair and makeup done by the professional paid by me\n\n>pictures in the same style on the same place on the same day and with the same make up and hair", "You feel incredibly selfish because you *are*.\n\nWho is going to even see the pregnancy photos but your sister and husband. And, really, who besides them would notice or even *care*. Except. You.\n\nNow, while your sister is off getting photographed, I would maybe instead be wanting my maid of honor to be with me, assisting in you know, maid of honor stuff, and be involved in the lead up to the actual ceremony, (the reason she is even there and dolled up in the first place?) And I wouldn\u2019t want the photographer to be distracted by a side gig? And I would be worried about the timing, too, because weddings are on a schedule.\n\nBut that\u2019s not your concern.

YTA", "YTA if it is not going to interfere with any of your wedding photos getting taken or the photographer being present I fail to see the harm.  So what if they are in the same style? I can understand her reasoning for wanting to take advantage of the situation.  It\u2019s a reasonable ask as long as it doesn\u2019t take away from your time with the photographer.  Perhaps a good solution is to share your concerns with the photographer and ask him/her to shoot her photos in a style so that they don\u2019t look like they were taken in the exact same place.", "Why don\u2019t you let your sister ask the photographer and they can make the decision.  That pulls you out of the equation.", "NAH - I get your perspective completely. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t ask what your sister is, but I get that she will feel beautiful and be in a beautiful setting and she wants to take advantage of that. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d just leave it up to the photographer. If they think they have time for a mini-shoot, fine. But if they are going to be too busy photographing the wedding, they\u2019ll tell you. Photographers would way rather focus on the thing making them $1000\u2019s instead of a couple 100.", "Not enough information.\nI would expect that these would be a timing issue as if the photographer is already on site, he is usually already busy taking photos of the venues, the couple, the parents/ close family and then the guests as they arrive. If there is any risk to compromise this then absolutely NTA.\nIf however, you just do not want her to have photos with the same makeup and dress as in your wedding photos I would say YTA. None of your business really as she could be doing it all the same another time and I honestly do not understand why it would matter?", "YTA why do you care.", "YTA.  It doesn\u2019t sound like this will in any way interfere with your wedding.  Your sister just wants some special photos of herself while pregnant.

Why are you saying no?  You clearly love your sister and want to make her happy.  But you also want your wedding to be perfect.  Are you afraid your wedding photos won't be as good?  Or do you just not want her to get the benefit of what you have paid for, then could she pay for her own hair and makeup, would you be happy?  If that wouldn't make you happy and you just want her to not have her photos look like your photos is it because in the future when people look at your wedding photos they will go, hey I have seen a pic like this at sisters house where she is pregnant!

You could even have one of the photos of the two of you together.....one sister as a bride and one as a pregnant bridesmaid, cool photo.", "Aren't people allowed to be just a tiny bit selfish on their wedding? Can't they have one day that's really truly 100% about celebrating them? It's like those horror stories where someone hijacks a best-man speech to propose to his gf. FFS, can't the newlyweds have a single day?", "I would argue it does take away from wedding photos. Photographers are contracted for a certain number of hours - in the hours before my wedding, my photographers were doing detail shots, photos of the groomsmen, empty venue shots, bridesmaid getting ready photos, then first look photos and some family shots. They were super busy before the ceremony \n\nSo unless the sister only wants like 15 minutes and a couple quick shots, it will interfere. Realistically, she should ask someone to take a few shots of her with their phone or hire her own photographer separate from OPs photographer if her objective is not wanting to get hair/makeup done again. \n\nPlus, I\u2019m sure my photographers would have been annoyed to be double booked, even if they were getting paid by the sister. They purposefully commit to events to focus on quality work.

In this case, booked for the wedding, for certain hours, and charged for those hours.   \nif sis does a pregnancy shoot, she will be squeezing into those hours. doesnt matter if she pays or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, the photographer has the freedom to set apart time and charge.   \nBut IMO, it should not be on OP's time. it just doesnt seem right.   \nBesides, if the sis doesnt mind paying, y not book a photographer for a pregnancy shoot. if she likes the cloths so much, she can wear them again.", "They\u2019re sisters, not adversaries.

There is rarely any down time. If there happens to be a break in the schedule, I would use it to set up my lights for the reception.

Also when the photographer isn't busy shouldn't that be their break times.

I agree with other commenters that letting the photographer know so they can have a pregnancy photographer on speed dial when she asks would be best. \n\nPlus, keep in mind that photographers often have a specialty. A wedding photographer may be much happier photographing live events rather than portraits, and decline purely based on that.

It\u2019s easy to say \u201coh it\u2019ll only take a few minutes\u201d, but it rarely works out that way and your sister will be disappearing with your photographer at a time that your photographer should be working on stuff for you and at a time you may also need her for something. This is *especially* true if she expects him to set up a specific location for her, use lighting, or if she is changing into different clothing etc. \n\nOverall it\u2019s just not a good idea and there\u2019s definitely a legitimate risk of something happening that could cause a rift or put a damper on your day.", "Nta, it conflicts with your arrangements, she can just get the photos another day or hire someone else.

You don\u2019t want them to have to juggle another shoot during the time of your wedding. It\u2019s really unprofessional from the photographer imo to even consider adding in another shoot (not sure if they are or not), because usually wedding photos are packed and they will have very little extra time. The photographer should be preparing for your shots - you have the first look and all that, plus usually you get shots preparing and getting your makeup and stuff\u2026 then there is test shoots and lighting at the venue\u2026 how on earth is it fair to you to have hired a photographer than then goes to take another client during your time?", "NTA- would a wedding photographer even do this? I know mine would not have done a side photo shoot for maternity pictures putting more work on them when they already have at least a 12 hour day. Also many photographers have a field they specialize in and don't like to dictate from that. That being said i know you aren't planning on it but it would be incredibly rude to ask your photographer to do this.", "NTA, but ask the photographer how much extra it will cost. Because the photographer should charge at least as much as an entirely different shoot, because of the pressure and being rushed, not to mention trying to satisfy two women at once.\nAnd point out to sister that it would make her pregnancy just a footnote of your wedding, not a separate event.", "NTA. Would the photographer even agree to this? I would imagine most wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI can see asking the photographer to take some extra solo shots of her, highlighting that she is pregnant, but taking time away from photographing the wedding?

It\u2019s ok for the photographer to take a nice photo of some family during the wedding (I have lovely pictures of my siblings with their partners etc.) but not a whole photo shoot! \n\nBesides, surely the photographer will be taking pictures then anyway? Guests arriving, first look at the bride, the venue all set up etc\u2026", "NTA. If your photographer is a professional, they would never agree to this. Double booking is a no-no. So, call and talk to your photographer and let them know that you do not approve and ask them if they would be willing to tell your sister to make an appointment at a later time if she approaches them on your wedding day. Your photographer is there to shoot photos of your wedding day. They will be way too busy to do what your sister is asking. Does she act like this often or is it out of character for her?", "NTA and just give the heads up to the photographer. They won't have time to do a separate shoot anyway but it's worth letting them know that if your sister tries to wheedle a few pictures, the answer is no.", "Photographer will likely not want to combine what would be 2 separate jobs into one, especially if the main one is a wedding shoot. So I would ask the photographer and tell them that it could not happen during the wedding photo shoot hours. \n\nSounds like your sister is trying to avoid a photographer\u2019s fee by piggybacking on to your event.", "Your sister should be asking the photographer instead of you. They may not agree to do this.", "Your photographer is unlikely to agree to this, they are already rushed off their feet and utterly exhausted shooting the wedding.\n\nDon't forget to make sure they get bathroom breaks, plenty of water and food.", "NTA. As the MOH, will she actually have time to do this?\n\nIf I were the bride, I would not be opposed to her getting HER OWN photographer for later on in the evening to do a pregnancy photo shoot after all her MOH duties were done to take advantage of the makeup and hair, but not during the wedding.", "NTA. Look at it from a different perspective - if you have someone booked to come and do hair/makeup and you sign a contract to have them do hair and makeup for 5 women, and then said they would also need to take care of 3 others, even if the stylist agreed, it\u2019s now screwed up the schedule. And now to accommodate the extra hair and makeup that needs to be done, they have to rush through those original 5 women and take time off their services. \n\nYou booked a service with the expectation time and attention would be paid to taking photos and editing the final versions. Even if your sister agrees to pay for one hour out of your day, that means everything around that hour is going to have to be rushed and depending on the schedule, the photographer could miss some moments you\u2019d want captured.\n\nI understand the desire to hit two birds with one stone while you\u2019re already made up, but that\u2019s not fair to you or the photographer. I would have a conversation with your photographer to make sure they are aware of the ask and that she may try to sneak in a photo shoot, so they should be prepared to say no. And I would also offer sis a bone and invite her to your bridal hair and makeup test. Pay for her to get her hair and makeup done with you, and encourage her to book her own shoot that day.", "NTA, this is an absurd request for her to make that disrespects your professional contract with the photographer (who has specific timelines, shot lists, etc. for your wedding and your wedding only) and the photographer's time (she wants to squeeze a whole other photoshoot into hands-down the busiest type of photography day). \n\nWould she pay *you* back for the shoot, or is she paying the photographer? Has she talked to the photographer about this? Sounds like she's trying to mooch off the wedding by using the hair and makeup stylists, your venue, and your photographer that you paid for in order to avoid scheduling and paying for it on her own.", "I would say that if she works out a deal with the photographer where it doesn't interfere and she gets to have hers after/before(maybe cheaper), then win win. \n\nIt's your day and up to you though, I just wouldn't push family away if an alternative is available personally.", "I would not have a problem with this.

Yes, she\u2019s going to be in the same makeup and clothes - who cares? Do you think people actually pay that much attention to other peoples\u2019 wedding photos and maternity photos? She\u2019s probably feeling enormous and not great about herself right now and maybe she feels great in the dress and knows your makeup artist will do a great job.

It also feels like full on bridesmaid makeup and hair styles would be rather weird for a pregnancy photo shoot - those usually have a different aesthetic and vibe.  \n\nRun it by your photographer, if only for them to be ready with a response if she hassles them, but it\u2019s also very likely that they will say it will not work for them or be very specific about what it would be taking away from, which will help you respond to your sister better.\n\nNTA.", "**Tell her it's in your contract that you can't use the photographer this way.**\n\nMost photographers actually do have it in their contract, especially wedding photographers, outlining what they will be doing for the day.

I'd just say kindly that while you totally get where she is coming from, actually the wedding photography gig is a full-day shoot where the photographer is likely to have very little down time. And yes, prime the photographer to back you up. \n\nI do also think, though, as per previous poster suggestion, that it could be a nice idea to ask the photographer whether they think it's feasible to take a couple of pictures of her on the day with her bump as a kindness to her? It may be that the photographer has had experience with this kind of request before and can let you know if they think it won't work.", "What if she got a second photographer for herself? Would you think you still have a say in her using the hairstyle makeup and dress?", "I agree with the others NTA.  You have every right to feel the way you do. And you don't owe your sister time out of your wedding day for her to take pregnancy photos. I'm not sure I get the \"in the same style\" part. Unless your photographer has a very distinct style that other people would recognize. I also assume sister is in the wedding party and will have some responsibilities that day that might keep her too busy to step away for a photo shoot.   Weddings are tedious and meticulously timed affairs.  So I can't imagine as the bride or bridesmaid trying to add extra stress to the day.  \n\nOk I rambled: TL;DR. If you want to compromise some suggestions are below.\n\nBUT IF you wanted to compromise you could talk to the photographer first and ask if it's possible for her to take 2-5 pictures of just your sister. Most photogs I've worked with can do that via candids or just grabbing sister as soon as her hair/makeup is done. But they can't work in a whole separate photo shoot during a wedding.  If you are willing and the photographer is will, set out very detailed expectations to your sister. For example things like: It won't be more than X number of pictures, no retakes, no props, she needs to wear a different dress (if that's what your men by same style?),has to be posed near where other pictures will be taken, no spending time roaming around looking for the perfect spot and a time limit as well as saying the photographer has the ability to nix the extra pictures for any reason. I suggest no more than 10 or 15 minutes for posed. Then the photographer can try to get some stylized candids of her during the wedding and reception.   \n\nIf you don't want to do all that you can just tell sister it's not possible for the photographer to do a separate posed shoot that day.  Then ask the photographer if she can try to get some nice candids of sister that might work as a pregnancy photo. Then you can give sister those pictures as a surprise.\n\nI mean I get why she asked. It's not often I can get my hair and make up done professionally and have a good photographer. So she probably feels like that will be the \"prettiest\" she can get.

So your sister is asking to take time away from your wedding photos, time you\u2019ve paid for, to do her own shoot. And for that min. 1 hour, you get nothing even though you paid for something?\n\nWeddings tend to be a full working day for a photographer (not counting all the work post wedding). Your photographer has zero time for another shoot and cannot shoot someone else in the block you\u2019ve paid for. \n\nAs others have suggested, give the photographer a heads up, especially if they aren\u2019t a veteran wedding photographer and might feel some pressure.", "There won\u2019t be time. Your photographer will say no for that reason anyway. I paid for a photographer to be there from getting ready until first dance. He moved between the bridal party and the groomsmen for getting ready as we all got ready in rooms at either end of the venue. He took a break for his lunch after speeches whilst everyone ate. The rest of the time he was one of the busiest people there. Your photographer will not have time for a newborn shoot.", "NTA. I understand both sides but the wedding photographers gonna be super busy and it\u2019s not on you to subsidize her pregnancy shoot.", "I think a good solution is to say yes with 2 conditions: she steps down as MOH and she also books another photographer. As other people have mentioned the photographer has limited time to shoot as it is, you would not be an asshole by still giving her the time and the makeup and hair. She can have other priorities during the day but yours still remain the same, make her a bridesmaid only.", "NTA, Wedding photographer was there to photograph *a wedding*. Not some preggo lady who wants the spotlight.", "If she is willing to pay for the photographer\u2019s time and if the photographer is willing and if it won\u2019t interfere with the primary reason for being there in the first place, then in my opinion I think you would be the asshole for not letting her do it.  However, any one of those things, if she is not paying, if the photographer is unwilling, if it will interfere with the primary purpose of being there (your wedding), then you would not be the asshole.  I would talk to the photographer and your wedding planner and ask them if they have run into this in the past and how best to handle it.", "NTA - photography is exhausting as it is and you want your photographer\u2019s energy focused on your wedding, not exhausted from a maternity shoot. \n\nShe can pick ANY other day, she doesn\u2019t need to hijack YOUR photographer on YOUR ACTUAL WEDDING DAY, just no.", "NTA, it\u2019s splitting the photographers time between two things and their priorities. Your wedding day should be about you and participating in it, not going off and having a shoot", "NAH. That would be stressful for everyone, plus the timing, and getting ready photos. Sorry to her, it would be great if that could work out, but that\u2019s too much.", "The photographer would probably tell her no anyway. Tell your sister no, and that those pictures would be done separately anyway. You don't get to cheat your photographer and they probably wouldn't be happy with your sister pulling that anyway. NTA", "If there\u2019s time and she pays for the extra hour, I don\u2019t see a problem with sharing the photog. \n\nMy favorite picture of my parents was a formal of just the two of them on my wedding day.  \n\nMy SIL has a picture of just her and my brother from her sister\u2019s wedding prominently displayed. \n\nWether or not she books private time with the photographer, the photographer will be taking pictures of your family with out you.  \n\nMaybe ask her to wear something other than her bridesmaid dress. Then change.", "NTA - the ask alone makes your sister a huge AH. It's your wedding, not her baby shower, and she needs to stop making your day about her. I'd reconsider having her as part of the bridal party if she even mentioned this idea again", "She's being a gross opportunist, ynta\n\nshe can use her own time to find her own life event photographer", "NTA and I'd be shocked if the photographer was down with it. A pregnancy shoot is a different animal all together, I know I wouldn't want to bring the extra gear and the mixed headspace. A wedding is already exhausting to a photographer as is.", "NTA.

What is it with people wanting to horn in on other people's events, especially weddings?? Do not feel selfish at all, her request is out of line and totally self centered on a day that is all about you and your groom.  \nHonestly, I doubt that the photographer would go for this anyway!

It would be okay to ask the photographer take a single nice photo of her and her husband to commemorate her being pregnant on the occasion, but it\u2019s not at all appropriate for her to do a full photo shoot on the day even if she hired her own photographer.", "NTA.\n\nWhen would the photographer have time?\n\nShe needs to schedule her own appointment some other day.", "If the photographer agreed to this I\u2019d seriously question their professionalism and commitment to your photos.

Is she always this entitled?", "A good pregnacy photo shot takes around 2 hours. I wouldnt advice doin at the same day. It would take wedding photos time", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH.\n\nI loathe the \u201cit\u2019s YOUR day\u201d angle of weddings because while it is your day, it requires the cooperation, expense, time, consideration, and planning of many other people. BUT this is the conventional expectation, and by that standard it\u2019s a dick move for her to invite herself to take maternity photos on your day. Especially the inviting herself.\n\nHowever. If it was my dearest friend who I knew wanted photos, and her hair and makeup was already being done, and IF the photographer could somehow accommodate? I\u2019d encourage it if not suggest it myself. Presumably she\u2019d have given her whole day and probably her whole year to help me with my wedding.

So she's going to be absent during this crucial time with you?\n\nI totally get wanting to do the shots bc the hair and makeup will be \"perfect\", but outside of a few cellphone shots from the girls or her partner,  this is a pretty selfish ask and would be a No for me.\n\nEdit: please also give your photographer a heads up and let them know it's a hard NO for any requests from folks for other shots. No maternity shots, no quick engagement photos, no spontaneous family photos. And that they do not need to worry about you being upset they said no.

A maternity shoot takes longer and a wedding much MUCH longer. \n\nAnyway, I get where sister is coming from: two birds, one stone with the hair and make up, but she's really not comprehending anything from the photographer's (likely) perspective.

Like, are we going to have sister and husband in the same spots at the photos of the bride and groom? Does the location have enough areas with variety to make it possible to split the \"good spots\" between the two different couples? Do we need to go to another location?

Just like 5 photos of them in the setting sun. It didn\u2019t conflict with any events and turned out beautiful. Maybe OP could compromise with something like this?", "That \"Big Day\" is such a joke when the divorce happens, if it does.  LOL big weddings are not a good idea imho.", "Have you ever been part of a wedding??? Typically the photographer is taking pictures thruout the entire wedding before and after. The last wedding I was involves in the photographer was bouncing back and forth between the bride and groom's wedding party taking photos of us getting ready. Then you have the actual ceremony and then post-ceremony celebrations. There is no way in hell the photographer will have time for a separate photo shoot. Just doesn't logistically work out.", "Exactly, there is no time so NTA. It's YOUR day and it seems like she just wants to take advantage of having her hair and makeup done", "And if it's a full day photographer, at some point, they'll need to eat.", "Not to mention pics of the venue/decor/table settings and close ups of rings/dresses etc. they need to do it before wedding starts.", "A pregnancy photo shoot. SMH", "This. This is such a great answer. If you feel uncomfortable saying no directly to your sister, you can pretend to have asked your photographer about it and that they gave you the above answer. Obviously, give your photographer a heads up about this, too \ud83d\ude02.", "Yes! I was exclusively a wedding photographer for 20 years and even though my second was a maternity photographer, it would be a hard no for both of us. We\u2019re running around like crazy on a wedding day! We barely have time to use the bathroom. Not to mention the planning and time that goes into maternity photos\u2014 it takes hours just to do those. Sister is crazy and this would leave a bad taste in my mouth going into the wedding.", "As per my comment of being a team of two wedding photogs - you are spot on! Even with a secondary shooter the gal in question has no idea of what a wedding photographer does nor the time/bandwidth needed for the wedding alone - much less a secondary shoot.", "Yes, PLEASE give the photographer a heads up! If not they might feel obligated to oblige the sister. I'm a photographer and if it happened to me I'd feel stuck between a rock and a hard place not knowing if this was something the bride wanted to happen or not. I'd want to refuse but also you want to make sure that didn't come at the expense of upsetting a bride (who is paying me a lot of money).", "Not to mention  it's a better business deal for the photographer.\n\nA professional doesn't want to be double booked in a day, plus, is the sister intending to pay him for his time on the day of the wedding or is she expecting on a two for one deal? Because that's not only screwing over her sister but the photographer as well.\n\nBook them and pay them for a full session or don't bother asking the person because they are already working.\n\nNTA.", "As a photographer, I've gotten this request several times.  It's never been a problem for me or any other photographer I know. Heck, why wouldn't I want to get paid twice for the same location", "Bot", "she'd be photographed looking radiant for the wedding no matter what, but a maternity shoot in the middle of OP's wedding day is both impractical and uncouth", "10 mins?\n\nNo. It means lighting, lens, location, equipment, setting said equipment up... much longer than 10 minutes... especially when they are there to shoot a wedding, not a baby bump.\n\nIf OP wants to gift her a maternity shoot, she can, at her baby shower or after the wedding day, not during it.", "Am wedding photographer, you\u2019re absolutely right, not a chance in hell anyone even *could* do this let alone would agree to it. A whole wedding day seems like a lot of time but we\u2019re usually scheduled down to the minute trying to get everything. There\u2019s no sane and professional photographer who would take this on.", "This, they are not going to let this screw up their wedding photos", "She\u2019s mooching time", "I mean, she'll definitely be hoping the photographer will give her a good deal since the bride will have paid for them to be there anyway & their time for the day is already being covered.\n\nNot to mention the $200 of hair/make-up she'll be saving.", "She\u2019s mooching the focus and attention of the photographer during her sister\u2019s wedding. If the pregnancy shoot takes 1/2 hour, that\u2019s 1/2 hour of before wedding photos that will be missing for OP.", "Then she should have no problem paying them on any other day. My photographer was photographing constantly as we were getting ready, and they were mostly pics of me and of my husband getting ready. She is mooching time, which you don\u2019t get back", "Do you see how wrong you are? If not maybe take some cues from the socially conscious people in the room and sit down.", "She hasn\u2019t offered to pay anything", "OP said clearly in their post their sister would pay for her session.", "Doesn't matter. No professional photographer would ever do this, and for a good reason. You don't get to rent the photographer away from the event they've been hired to shoot for the day lol", "VERY good point. No professional photographer would ever do something like this - I imagine the professional photographers reading this post are laughing out loud - but it would be good for OP to give the photographer a heads up that her sister asked about this and obviously OP and groom know how ridiculous it is. Just so the photographer knows that when she turns the sister down it won't cause drama with the bride and groom", "So anybody can ask the photographer to take pictures if it doesn't mess with the wedding day?\n\nThe photographer has a schedule to keep and different shots that they are contractually obligated to get. Wedding photography is way different than maternity photography.", "Probably. She asked her sister and didn\u2019t try to be sneaky about it. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it as long as it could be done without interfering with the wedding photography.", "Yea. It probably wouldn\u2019t be logistically possible which would have a been a better way for OP to think about it and respond.", "Usually they wouldn\u2019t, but sister is using OP for a cheap photoshoot.", "But those aren\u2019t the reasons op gave. The reasons op gave make her the asshole. If she had said it was about logistics of the photographer having time and attention no one would be saying YTA.", ">...she just wants to take advantage of having her hair and makeup done\n\nAnd I can't really blame her for this. But what she needs to do is arrange for her own photographer to take pictures on that day.", " He no longer needs to focus only on the wedding photos (which,", "At some point they'll need to pee - or sit down- or check their photos - change lenses, batteries.... or just breath.  It is in fact a FULL day, as I've done a few weddings and it's a whirlwind!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "You just don't get it, for someone it's their biggest achievement.", "[removed]", "yes, I shot weddings for many years too, and not only would I decline this on behalf of the bride, I understood that when I had a wedding, I only wanted to focus on that wedding. I did not want to shift gears, so that I could get the best results for both of these types of shoots.\n\nI would never feel obligated by a guests asking me this, in fact, it would be a hard no really fast. lol", "This is a good point. I mostly do casual natural light maternity shoots in outdoor settings but they still take longer than other sessions for numerous reasons. Among other things you have to choose areas that are very easy to get to, require little walking, have places to sit down, etc... Some maternity sessions involve props and outfit changes and all kinds of extravagant details. That's not the style of work I do so I wasn't even thinking about that, if sister goes on pinterest and decides she wants a very stylized aesthetic it could take hours to achieve her expected results. Who knows if this photographer even does maternity photos or anything in the style what sister has in mind?", "You've been lucky. In my experience \"small favors\" tend to turn into a \"no good deed goes unpunished\" situation. If sister is super chill, has already seen the photographer's work and likes it, doesn't want anything special like props or changes of clothes, is actually ready to start 1.5 hours before the wedding photos are contracted to start, etc... that's one thing. But I find that any time I flex a little to accommodate something that should be easy I end up fully bent over backwards because that \"one extra thing\" was just a foot in the door.", "If I ever get married, I\u2019m actually now thinking that hiring a second photographer to give everyone who\u2019s gone to all the effort of getting dressed up get the chance to get some decent personal shots. Better results than one of those photo-booth things. Though I would probably be more inclined to have a shorts & t-shirt BBQ wedding than a formal one\u2026", "And I wonder if she'd be providing her own scenery or asking to use the wedding venue", "An you know very well, there is no 1/2 hour work in this world.", "Excuse me?? So just because my opinion doesn't match that of others, I should just sit down and keep my mouth shut? Haha I don't think so. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, including me.", "Says, sure, but whether she actually will, doubtful. Think about it \u2014 if she\u2019s actually planning to pay for her own photographer, why not bring another photographer to the wedding? Why use OP\u2019s? This sounds like the setup for big time mooching.", "fr, the photographer will be busy. taking photos. of the wedding. in my mind, if sis hires the photographer for that day, it just means she\u2019s snaked op\u2019s photographer, and op won\u2019t get what she paid for. also, sis is moh. at the wedding. that day. does she not think *she\u2019ll* be busy? cause she should be. nta.", "Yes, just like if a random person called the photographers business phone and inquired about a photo shoot at that time. If they are not already obligated to the wedding at that time, they are free to schedule other business. This is, of course, how business works.", "They've literally said in their comments:  \n\n\n>If it interferes with the schedule, it\u2019s a clear no.  \n>  \n>First can your sister hire the photographer at that time?\n\nSo they're only disagreeing with OP **if** there is no interruption to OP's schedule. I honestly think that some of you could pick a fight with yourself in an empty room.", "Why would inquiring with the photographer be a problem? They can say no.", "if this is an american wedding OP wouldnt ever have possession of a bridemaids outfit.", "Yeah I get she wants to take advantage but still shitty since op is paying for the time", "That would pull her out of the wedding photos.", "This is the way.", "Why can't you really blame her for this? Seems rather selfish to take the time away from her sister's wedding to get a photoshoot done by her wedding photographer, after her sister paid for her hair and makeup.", "Doesn't sound like OP would be ok with this, as her issue seems to be with her sister having pictures \"in thr same style at the same place on the same day\" etc. My impression is OP would still be pretty miffed if her sister brought in her own photographer on the day.", "Wait! You are human? You are not just stored in a closet?!/s The photog we hire for our yearly event at work is ALWAYS given a meal with the rest of the guests. She is very nice and very human. We even help hold things for her because two hands and sometimes wind. Oh also herding the cats er people to the photo area.", "[removed]", "What can I say; I'm flexible and super easy to work with. There's no doubt I would have scooped up that second gig in a second.", "I just got married two days ago and our photographer had a second shooter. they both spent plenty of time with us, and there was plenty of time during the reception for them to take pictures of all our guests. none of our guests were trying to have a full photoshoot to document their pregnancy though.", "Having two photographers at weddings/receptions is actually pretty standard now a days. Our photographer was great and got photos of every family that was there (except my in-laws friends who brought their child to our child free wedding).", "Yes! Our photographer was great and took a few fancy photos of our wedding party with their families so they could use them as Christmas photos, etc if they wanted. I thought it was really nice to be able to do that for them.", "My photographers were a husband/wife couple, and they did this for our guests of their own volition while my husband and I took some solitary private time between the ceremony and reception. Some of our guests have those photos on their walls. Makes me happy.", "We just went to a wedding yesterday and they had exactly this - before the ceremony they had a portrait photographer in the library, and then after they had an outdoor portrait setup with little couches and all. TONS of great pictures of folks all dressed up and looking snazzy.", "That's a great idea!", "Do you know how much make up artists charge for bridal related make up (which includes brides maids) \n\nShe\u2019s mooching", "You just seem very, very out of touch with both weddings and professional photography. Wedding photographers are busy the whole time. They are shooting not just the bride and her bridesmaids getting ready, but also the groom and groomsmen, also the entire venue, the decorations, the reception, cake, people, arriving at the venue... there will not be any time to have a completely separate pregnancy photo shoot literally *in the middle of* the wedding day.\n\nAnd even if there was time, that is completely, over the top ridiculous to ask a photographer to squeeze in a totally separate photo shoot with totally separate objectives, lenses, backgrounds, etc. *into the middle of the wedding photography.* \n\nThe whole thing is just laughably absurd. Maybe you'll get a better understanding of this if you picture a different scenario? Like if someone is hired to photograph a college basketball game, and the coach's sister wants to \"borrow\" the photographer during halftime to shoot pregnancy photos. Surely you see how ridiculous that is?", "Well, it's just that your opinion is incredibly ignorant, objectively, because you don't seem to understand what wedding photography consists of. There's nothing wrong with that, but as people are trying to explain to you all of the major aspects of this issue you're missing, you're mostly doubling down. It's not even about the \"mooching\"; it's about how laughably absurd it is to think this is something any photographer would ever in a bazillion years agree to do even if the bride and groom were OK with it. \n\nIt's just SO absurd; I almost hope OP tells her sister she can go ahead and ask the photographer if the they're willing to do it and then report back to us how the photographer laughed in the sister's face because this is truly so completely ridiculous and som thing that would never, ever ever ever ever happen.\n\nSo yeah, \"opinions\" can be objectively wrong, and yours here happens to be. That's not an insult or anything, just a statement of fact. You don't seem to be aware of what goes into things like wedding photography, and if you've never been married or intimately involved in a wedding or wedding photography, why would you? Nothing wrong with that, just trust the rest of us that this is a hilariously insane request.", "[deleted]", "It depends on how sister asks. She might let the photographer think that the bride wants it.", "This would depend on who is ordering/making/paying for the dresses.", "OP said her sister is going to pay for the pregnancy photo shoot. OP isn\u2019t getting billed for both photo shoots.", "This seems like sort of a shitty backhanded insult that anyone that wouldn\u2019t accommodate that request is somehow not flexible or super easy to work with. I\u2019ve been a second shooter / assistant on a ton of weddings. It\u2019s super common for hair & makeup to run long. Bridesmaids arrive late for their appointment times or don\u2019t like their results & ask for a redo. Inexperienced hair / makeup artists underestimate their time & don\u2019t start early enough. Something unforeseen that is nobody\u2019s fault goes wrong. It somehow takes 30 minutes for a bridesmaid to put her dress on. Etc. If Sis understands that her maternity shoot is predicated on \u201ceverything else is running on time\u201d & is willing to skip it if something happens with the schedule, then that\u2019s one thing. But I wouldn\u2019t want to risk missing any important pre-ceremony photos or risk delaying the ceremony start time because I\u2019m off somewhere else taking maternity photos with a bridesmaid that has now decided her shoot is more important than what the bride has going on. It doesn\u2019t seem like a risk worth taking on a wedding gig.", "I try to be as flexible as possible but it usually backfires on me because people see me willing to do one extra thing then take it to the next level. I know with my luck sister and husband would be running late but still expect the full hour, suddenly want to do the photos at another location, then with every photo of the bride throughout the day try to hold things up with \"Oh, that spot is so pretty, can you get *just one more* of me standing there too? Okay, now one with my husband, where is he? Hold on, I'll be right back!\"", "Now something like that is really nice and I've been to christenings where they've done that but a whole maternity  photoshoot for the sister is a bit much", "I've done that at the bride's request. At the reception I went around to the people she wanted me to photograph and asked them to let me know when they and their family were available to do a few photos and it worked out well. They had time to gather up the kids and we stepped outside to a spot I pre-selected. The bride got the photos of her wedding party with their families that she/they wanted and it took me less than 5 minutes each time.", "Esxactly. I'm not sure how op's wedding is going to be set up but the last wedding I was in this summer, the photographer never stopped running around. He was finding places to have pictures, going in between the bridal shots and the groom's shots, communicating what they wanted and all that. That's what you pay for, full attention. To take that time away is absolutely mooching.", "Mooching also can be more than financial. Stealing the photographer (even if she pays for their services) is still mooching, she did no work to find, screen, or book photographers, venue, or hair and makeup. NTA. tell her no!!", "Bingo.  Mooches gonna mooch.", "your comment makes you sound like a teenager\ud83d\ude2d", "Well, you guys are thinking ten steps of hypotheticals  ahead and I don\u2019t want to go there. \n\nI\u2019m just saying that I don\u2019t see why someone would object to the sister having her pictures taken if it doesn\u2019t interfere with the wedding and if the photographer agrees. If those 2 conditions aren\u2019t met, the answer should be no. \n\nIf OP would decide that it\u2019s okay, why not ask the photographer if they are willing to do a pregnancy shoot? If they say no, end of story.\n\nedited for spelling", "If the photographer discounts her for the time lost while doing the other photoshoot then that's one thing, but if she paid for the day then the photographer is getting paid twice for the same hour while the bride loses that time.", "Something tells me that\u2019s not how it will work out and that someone will conveniently need OP to pay for the additional shoot\u2026", "But it takes time away from OP. Time that she paid for.", "Lol, it's not extra if I'm being paid for it. Honestly, I'm really surprised to hear your take. The extra/sister job sounds like easy money to me", "People do not realize that photographers have ZERO down time during a wedding. You have to be watching everyone everywhere at all times. You run to the bathroom and boom, a special unscripted moment is missed. \"Did you catch the dance between my daughter and my grandpa?\" Uhhh... \ud83d\ude33 Don't even think about trying to eat, there is no sitting down.", "THATS WHAT IM SAYIN", "[deleted]", "After reading OPs post it seems like her main concern is that it\u2019s at the same location and same hair/makeup as the wedding. So really she doesn\u2019t care if it interferes or not, she doesn\u2019t want it associated with her wedding day.", "If a photographer will do this, they are not really professional photographers.  The only way to go around this is to hire a third photographer. Both the first and second would be busy doing bride/ groom prep.", "TELL EM BESTIE!!!!", "ah so you are just cosplaying as an \u201cadult\u201d. got a long way to go\ud83d\udc4d", "That\u2019s how I read it too. \n\nAnd that\u2019s her prerogative of course, but I think it\u2019s kinda lame. If I were in her shoes I would accommodate sister, but I\u2019m not going to call A H. In the end, it\u2019s her wedding."]}
