Most likely your photographer isn\u2019t willing to book other shoots the same day as the wedding anyway as you\u2019ve paid for the day. \n\n100% it is your wedding day, so no, you are not selfish for not wanting a pregnancy photoshoot of the MOH in the middle of it. She is selfish for asking", "**NTA**\n\nIt's your day.\n\n**Whilst I appreciate there may be a cost benefit to it**, there's also a cost benefit to using the evening reception food for breakfast.\n\nWhilst I can't quite put my finger on why the request is wrong, I *intrinsically* know it's wrong from gut feeling: the hairstyle, the flash, the dress, the makeup, the smile will all be the same... and that's without going into the passive '2 in 1' element of it, so...", "I would leave it up to the photographer.  When I got married, he was busy taking pics of us getting ready and there would have been no time to take pics of anyone else.  But it does seem odd that she wants her pics taken at the same place as where your wedding pics will be.", "There are two questions here:\n\nFirst can your sister hire the photographer at that time? This is between your sister and the photographer. You don't own the photographer.\n\nSecond is your sister free at that time to do a non-wedding personal errand? She is your maid of honor, so it might be a bit cheeky to disappear right before your wedding for a photoshoot.\n\nYou need to ask yourself whether it is important to you to have her there during that time. It is reasonable to not want your wedding to be usurped by other activities. If she was asking to go get some grocery shopping done and you would still say no then the timing is the issue and you are fully justified in saying no.\n\n>not wanting her to have her pictures in the same style on the same place on the same day and with the same make up and hair as my wedding pictures\n\nIf your only concern is that the *photos* will have the same look as your wedding photos them I am less sympathetic. I seriously don't get why it would matter.\n\nTry thinking of it this way: Whenever you see her pregnancy pics you will be reminded of your happy wedding ceremony. Instead of thinking about her photos taking away from your wedding somehow, think of them as another connection to your wedding.\n\nYou can look at them and think \"Boy, I chose a great looking bridesmaid dress!\" or \"Remember that toast she gave at the reception, it was so sweet.\"", "NTA\n\nIf she can afford the photographer, then she can afford her own hair and makeup.\n\nIt seems like she's bogarting your location shoots on top of everything else.\n\nIt's YOUR DAY.\n\nINFO: How far along is she?", "Nta. How will the photographer do the getting ready shots if they've gone? Do you get a discount while they're gone? Do they have neverending storage (I genuinely don't know)? Will the photographer be able to switch mental gears back and forth and think about the theme, etc? Who will be looking after you while your maid of honour is gone? If you were OK with it, then fine, but if you're not, that's fine too. There's literally very few times when a person gets focus on themselves. A wedding being one of them. It's OK to have a day to you.", "NTA and tell your photographer to be on the lookout for this and to shut it down.", "NTA  \nyou hired the photographer for the wedding.   \nIt is unfair to the professional because they are here to cover the wedding and someone is asking \"hey can you quickly do another shoot since we are in the same location\"  \nNot a good look at all.\n\nthey may say yes but I have never met any creative professional who will be happy to do two projects for the price of one.\n\nAnd am saying this as someone who works in the filed (not a photographer), it looks cheap.  \n\nAnd you are not selfish.\n\nyou are just uncomfortable with the ickiness ur sis' suggestion is giving you.", "I think the time factor may be something that neither you nor your sister is taking into account.  When my daughter got married 2 years ago, her photographer showed up at the salon where the bride and attendants were getting hair and makeup done.  This was before 11:00.  The wedding (at same venue as reception) was at 2 pm.  There was an outdoor photo session after the hair and makeup, at a different, scenic location, then the wedding, then wedding party went for more outdoor shots at a third location (reception didn\u2019t have an attractive outdoor spot).  These locations were all less than 10 minutes apart, but still\u2026. Then reception pics, cake, dancing, etc., until photographer left at about 5:30.  It was really a full day and I\u2019m doubtful that a wedding photographer would agree to splitting up his or her day.\n\nWe had to pay in advance (final payment on day of)\u2014so if photographer agreed to do sister\u2019s photos, she would most likely have to pay in advance as well.\n\nNevertheless, you look petty and selfish to refuse outright.  My suggestion is that you tell your sister to take it up with the photographer.  Then let the photographer know you\u2019re not in favor.  I\u2019m sure they can find a way to let sis down tactfully.", "NTA tell her to schedule her own special day.", "NTA but just tell her there won\u2019t be time because there won\u2019t be. Unless you\u2019ve opted out of preparation photos etc.", "I\u2019d just say, you really don\u2019t think that there would be time as the day will be really busy, but you\u2019d love to find some time for a dedicated session with her and get hair and make up done so she can have something dedicated to her, and the winner is you\u2019re being entirely honest", "NTA. shes making the day about herself. Its YOUR wedding. She can have a photoshoot any day. Dont feel selfish, you are the bride !!", "NTA the photographer would also need to take picture of you and your entourage getting ready, are they supposed to just disappear to follow your sister? You're the one who hired the photographer, they should be there for you and your event.", "NTA. \n\nSome of our absolute favorite wedding photos were taken during down time on the day or while getting ready.  You hired a *Wedding* photographer to photograph *your* day. Any length of time he spends doing a personal shoot for someone else is time he's not capturing *your* day. \n\nIt's absolutely fair to say that youre not comfortable with your wedding photographer, at your wedding venue, being used for any other events.  It's also fine not to be ok with a separate photo shoot at your wedding. It'd your day. The MOH is supposed to be focuses on you.", "NTA your photographer can't take a \"job\" while she's doing your \"job\". Your photographer would be taki5tine away from taking your pictures to concentrate on your sister. If she's a professional she wouldn't even agree to this.\n\nYour sister's request is like asking if she can get married real quick after your vows. She's trying take advantage of your venue and your preparations.", "NTA As others suggested, contact the photographer and tell them they are not to be hijacked by your sister. She is being lazy in not organising her own day and, I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't pay. Additionally, remember that your package includes a certain amount of photos. Your sister's photos would then be deducted leaving you with less. It's your day.", "I can see this one both ways.  I would say no to a whole photo shoot centered around her but would ask for the photographer to take a handful of photos of just her highlighting her belly. (Like 15 minutes)\n\nNAH/ESH", "NAH YET because this needs to be 100% up to your photographer. You should be the one to discuss this potential request with your photographer and tell her that in no way should she feel obligated to do this AND you want to make sure that if she accepts, it won't be taking any time away from her contracted time shooting your wedding photos. \n\nIf your photographer wants to take the gig and assures you she can do both without compromising quality or time, THEN, YWBTA for saying no to your sister.", "YTA.  My judgement assumes, because you didn\u2019t say otherwise and I think you would have, that this is a doable thing as far as the photographer goes, and would in no way take away their time with you etc.  \n\nYTA because you are ONLY concerned with her hair and makeup being the \u2018same\u2019 as your wedding and it\u2019s pictures.", "YTA\n\nThis seems like such a smart idea to me!  Surely there\u2019s a way to make this work - a different area of the grounds, a different-colour shawl or quick modified hairstyle\u2026 with a good photog and some thought, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t look like she\u2019s leaning away from you at the altar to have these pics taken. \n\nAnd in a year no one will care anyway. \n\nUp to you, but I see no real downside to letting her do this.", "If this were me and my sister, I would honestly find it really cute and special. This does sound selfish. You're entitled to do what you want with your own wedding photographer but kinda TA for this. Plus she's offering to pay for it. \n\nWhy not take advantage of a day where you get all pretty to have your pregnancy photoshoot? Wouldn't it be cute in the future to have kids look back on the pictures and realize \"Hey, this looks so familiar to my mom's wedding pictures...omg!!\" It's not like she's stealing your spotlight in any way. It sounds really selfish and superficial to tell her no just because she has her hair styled a certain way or whatever.", "NAH but I do question your motives for saying no. Not wanting to put the photographer under time pressure is understandable but your reasons sound selfish. Still, it's your wedding.\n\n>after she has her hair and makeup done by the professional paid by me\n\n>pictures in the same style on the same place on the same day and with the same make up and hair", "You feel incredibly selfish because you *are*.\n\nWho is going to even see the pregnancy photos but your sister and husband. And, really, who besides them would notice or even *care*. Except. You.\n\nNow, while your sister is off getting photographed, I would maybe instead be wanting my maid of honor to be with me, assisting in you know, maid of honor stuff, and be involved in the lead up to the actual ceremony, (the reason she is even there and dolled up in the first place?) And I wouldn\u2019t want the photographer to be distracted by a side gig? And I would be worried about the timing, too, because weddings are on a schedule.\n\nBut that\u2019s not your concern. You just don\u2019t want your sister to have the same hair and makeup in both photo shoots. YTA", "YTA if it is not going to interfere with any of your wedding photos getting taken or the photographer being present I fail to see the harm.  So what if they are in the same style? I can understand her reasoning for wanting to take advantage of the situation.  It\u2019s a reasonable ask as long as it doesn\u2019t take away from your time with the photographer.  Perhaps a good solution is to share your concerns with the photographer and ask him/her to shoot her photos in a style so that they don\u2019t look like they were taken in the exact same place.", "Why don\u2019t you let your sister ask the photographer and they can make the decision.  That pulls you out of the equation.", "NAH - I get your perspective completely. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t ask what your sister is, but I get that she will feel beautiful and be in a beautiful setting and she wants to take advantage of that. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d just leave it up to the photographer. If they think they have time for a mini-shoot, fine. But if they are going to be too busy photographing the wedding, they\u2019ll tell you. Photographers would way rather focus on the thing making them $1000\u2019s instead of a couple 100.", "Not enough information.\nI would expect that these would be a timing issue as if the photographer is already on site, he is usually already busy taking photos of the venues, the couple, the parents/ close family and then the guests as they arrive. If there is any risk to compromise this then absolutely NTA.\nIf however, you just do not want her to have photos with the same makeup and dress as in your wedding photos I would say YTA. None of your business really as she could be doing it all the same another time and I honestly do not understand why it would matter?", "YTA why do you care.", "YTA.  It doesn\u2019t sound like this will in any way interfere with your wedding.  Your sister just wants some special photos of herself while pregnant.  You could refuse, but that still wouldn\u2019t stop her from the putting the dress back on and recreating the hair and make-up the next day for a separate photo shoot.", "Info.  Why are you saying no?  You clearly love your sister and want to make her happy.  But you also want your wedding to be perfect.  Are you afraid your wedding photos won't be as good?  Or do you just not want her to get the benefit of what you have paid for, then could she pay for her own hair and makeup, would you be happy?  If that wouldn't make you happy and you just want her to not have her photos look like your photos is it because in the future when people look at your wedding photos they will go, hey I have seen a pic like this at sisters house where she is pregnant!  What's the issue that is driving you.  \n\nNTA anyway your wedding your rules.", "YTA\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nDo you think, people will compare the photos and say: Oh, but her pics are better!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That they are free to arrange a different day with sister but please know that\u2019s they need to make sure sister knows that she is to pay for her own photo shoot and it\u2019s not included in your invoice, that you won\u2019t pay for it if you find she\u2019s told them to just add it to your costs.\n\nYou may say she wouldn\u2019t do that but lets be clear she is already trying to take and use a service that\u2019s for your wedding and turn it into her own.

Any other day is fine if the photographer wants to to ahead. I don't know of any photographer who would leave a venue (this is assuming they will be there for your getting ready pictures) to photograph another set up.", "That's what I was going to say, they usually compile a bunch of pictures of people getting ready, guests arriving etc. You'd miss at least an hour for a pregnancy photo shoot.", "She's not mooching if she's offered to pay for the photographer.", "OP clearly states sister would pay for her own photo shoot.", "Except that any time spent and amount of photos taken of the mooching sister (I doubt the sister would pay) would be deducted from the bride's package. \nOP should absolutely not give up the time and amount of photos contracted in package she contracted with the photographer. \nThe lazy sister needs to get her beind in gear and stop riding off on others peoples days and efforts.", "I like this. You could even have one of the photos of the two of you together.....one sister as a bride and one as a pregnant bridesmaid, cool photo.", "Aren't people allowed to be just a tiny bit selfish on their wedding? Can't they have one day that's really truly 100% about celebrating them? It's like those horror stories where someone hijacks a best-man speech to propose to his gf. FFS, can't the newlyweds have a single day?", "I would argue it does take away from wedding photos. Photographers are contracted for a certain number of hours - in the hours before my wedding, my photographers were doing detail shots, photos of the groomsmen, empty venue shots, bridesmaid getting ready photos, then first look photos and some family shots. They were super busy before the ceremony \n\nSo unless the sister only wants like 15 minutes and a couple quick shots, it will interfere. Realistically, she should ask someone to take a few shots of her with their phone or hire her own photographer separate from OPs photographer if her objective is not wanting to get hair/makeup done again. \n\nPlus, I\u2019m sure my photographers would have been annoyed to be double booked, even if they were getting paid by the sister. They purposefully commit to events to focus on quality work. We don\u2019t even know if OPs photographer would allow it", "I disagree - the sister can have her photoshoot on a different day, and can book the same photographer if she wants them so much. It\u2019s OP\u2019s special day, they should be the focus.", "she's not paying for her hair and makeup getting done, plus her sister booked the photographer.", "so basically,\n\nwhen a photographer is hired, its for an event. In this case, booked for the wedding, for certain hours, and charged for those hours.   \nif sis does a pregnancy shoot, she will be squeezing into those hours. doesnt matter if she pays or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, the photographer has the freedom to set apart time and charge.   \nBut IMO, it should not be on OP's time. it just doesnt seem right.   \nBesides, if the sis doesnt mind paying, y not book a photographer for a pregnancy shoot. if she likes the cloths so much, she can wear them again.", "They\u2019re sisters, not adversaries.

And you are right that the photographer may say no. It\u2019s just that OP\u2019s main reason for objecting was more focused on the photo\u2019s being too similar.", "Like I said before, this assumes the photo shoot wouldn\u2019t interfere with OP\u2019s wedding. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here.  A year from now, no one but OP and her partner will care about the wedding photos, and no one but the sister (and her partner, if there is one) will care about the pregnancy photos.  This is not worth getting so precious about.", "Yeah, but my point was that she's not mooching. I rhino photos of the two of them would look lovely", "I was agreeing with you, but maybe I didn't express it well? I was questioning the general tenancy of folks to label others selfish.
