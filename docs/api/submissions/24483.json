And then she would bad mouth them and belittle me for wanting them around or missing them. \n\nOP is gonna owe her kid a lot of therapy money", "Given her comments imma go with it's option B", "I'm betting she thought most people would side with her and wasn't coming in for advice, just validation.  No ego stroke to get here.  From her comments.. she sounds like a nightmare to be around.", "Except the only reason OP doesn't approve is because of her own bitterness towards the guy. It's not like he's trying to let the kid hang out with some random shady stranger.", "That kind of stuff? You mean saying goodbye to what was effectively his son, if not by blood?", "That's too bad. You don't get to dictate what dad does during his time. Shit, he could let them chat on the phone everyday if they wanted.", "Why do you wanna hurt your son?", "You're his mother. Anyone you marry will be a father figure because you're the mother figure. And if you don't get that you're gonna have a lot more divorces", "People who have survived the same disaster should be allowed to form support groups to deal with the trauma.", "Ahh, so you're throwing a tantrum because you aren't getting your way.", "It speaks volumes that this is what your objection apparently boils down to.", "Lol you are abusive.\n\nThis is \u201cisolation\u201d. You cannot do this to other people. Other people can talk to whoever they want and you trying to control that is **abuse**.\n\nLet me repeat\u2014you are an abuser. You need therapy TODAY.", "Honestly, it's no surprise that you're burning through husbands like they're a box of doughnuts. You sound insufferable. I don't even know you and I want a divorce. YTA.", "Don't want them finding out about the lies you told each of them, eh?\n\nYTA.", "You only need two more and you could have an ex-quartet.", "And you have no control over who anyone talks to. It's called autonomy and everyone has it even if you don't like it. Yta.\n\nAnd yes they do have something to talk to each other about. Your son who they both obviously care about way more than you do.", "Clearly they do since you don\u2019t give a flying fuck about your child\u2019s feelings", "YTA who should be considering the child's needs before your own. Also, you have business telling either ex who they can talk to.", "You\u2019re not in control of either of them and they have every right to speak to one another. \nYou\u2019re not the boss, you\u2019re the ex wife. You can\u2019t say who either of them can and can\u2019t talk to, and I genuinely feel bad for your son. \nYeah buddy, YTA.", "Why not???  How made you the boss of them???  YTA!!!", "Then try not to have so many", "I think you\u2019ll find, that it\u2019s none of YOUR business what two grown consenting men do.", "When did you become God? You CANNOT tell grown men what to do. That narasstic and controlling. Thank God you divorced them...they no longer have to put up with you. Hopefully the 1st husband sees this and goes for full custody. I feel sorry for your kid. And fully expect to see you here in 10 years asking why he wants NOTHING to do with you.", "You don't get to dictate who your grown ass adult exes speak to lmao, you're ridiculous.", "Hope they become buddies and hang out with your son more", "God I love people who think they can control whether two other adults communicate or not. Get over yourself, you ain't the prison warden, op.", "He's your *child*, not your possession.", "What Jack's father does on his time with him cannot be dictated by you. He was looking out for his son's best interest , you however weren't.", "That's the thing about divorcing someone. Your opinion means significantly less to them than it did before.", "Lol nobody cares. Your son has two parents. You don\u2019t dictate everything.\n\nAlso if you continue to not care about your son, his feelings, or relationships he built with people\u2014good luck ever seeing him graduate college, get married, or his children/your grandchildren.\n\nAll you care about is you. Great. Cause that\u2019s all you\u2019ll have ma\u2019am.", "You don\u2019t actually get to decide who your son\u2019s father has around him when it\u2019s his time. Not accepting that fact is going to do nothing but cause unnecessary problems in the future.", "Obviously no one cares. \"I said no\" and they did it anyways, suck it up, and fuck off to a therapist.", "Is that what the judge said?", "You need to get this through your head: Jack is your son's parent. He gets to make decisions. He gets to do what he deems is best for your son. You do not get to control the situation, especially since you are divorced. You do not get to dictate what happens on his parenting time. You do not get to place your wants and bitterness over your son's needs and happiness. You do not. \n\nYou've now been divorced twice. Instead of reflecting on the fact that your ability to maintain relationships is clearly faulty, and instead of reflecting on where you've gone wrong, you've decided that you are going to cause an argument with your ex. That argument? That Greyson is your ex, so your son should never see him again. Your son doesn't even deserve to say goodbye to someone who was in his life because you're angry that your marriage is over. You want to deprive your son of a goodbye and hurt him emotionally because your marriage failed. \n\nYou need to grow the hell up. You're like a middle schooler deciding that because they've broken up with their boyfriend, no one is allowed to talk to or acknowledge him. Your friends have an established relationship with your ex? Tough, because you said so, so there! Are you going to stamp your feet and pout next? Maybe start giving everyone the silent treatment, or are you going for a big tantrum? I'd ask if you're going to double down and squabble if anyone disagrees with you, but one look at your comments shows you've got that one down already. \n\nGrow up. Actually think about your son's needs and feelings. Stop trying to control the situation, and stop trying to dictate what your first ex can and cannot do. He did not do this to spite you, he did it because your son needed to say goodbye. Your son needed someone to put his feelings first, especially as I'm sure he's confused by what is going on, and since you seem incapable of caring about anything that anyone else wants or needs, your ex stepped up for your child. Be grateful he's an involved parent, and that your recent ex cared so much about your son that he needed to say goodbye, rather than him just walking away without a second glance. You say they lack common sense, but you seem to lack empathy even for your own child and clearly have control issues.", "You have a say in your home. If Jack and Greyson want to stay in contact for your son\u2019s sake; you have ZERO say. That\u2019s how being an \u201cex\u201d works.", "No you don\u2019t.", "HAH!!! Hahahaha, no. No you don\u2019t \ud83e\udd23", "It's still her call to make.", "She's a two time loser", "Agreed. Posts here are generally lacking info to some degree, but this one is discussing a very complex situation.. yet is one of the shorter posts. I'm assuming because extra info is irrelevant and/or (more likely) actively damaging to OP's \"case\". I don't like to assume, but OP didn't give us near enough info to do anything else lol.\n\n[*Incredibly* selfish though, wtf]", "Hell, one of my closest friends is an ex of an ex. We both went through the hell of dating someone who was an abusive nutcase... it was a bonding moment.", "This is one of the most ludicrous, least self aware, statements i have ever seen", "Do you not want the kid? Cause it sounds like you don't think of them *AT ALL* in any of this and are treating them like a possession instead of a kid who just lost a parent.", "Stop playing the victim. You don't give a crap about your son and his relationships. Not everything is about you and what you want. Frankly I hope your son starts ignoring your partners in the future because what's the point of having a relationship with them if it's only temporary?", "Common denominator in this dynamic is you, OP. Both of your ex husband's are behaving more maturely than you, seeing as they seem to have your son's interest at heart. You know, your son, that living being that seemingly you only see as an extension of you and your property, and by how you're acting, it seems likely that you see your son only as a tool to use at your disposal. YTA OP.", "YTA  \nLike the common sense to realise that maybe your son would want to say goodbye to a man he looks up? That kind of common sense?Also if you divorce two men for the exact same reason, maybe the issue isn't with the men...", "INFO: how long were you with each of your exes?", "Time to put your big girl pants on and either provide examples of the \"no common sense\" or realise that YTA", "And you Didn't have enough common sense to realize that before marriage.", "Is it wrong that I just want them to ride off into the sunset with the son?", "I kinda hope they do just because of how much it would make OP mad....\ud83d\ude05", "I feel awful for her son tbh. Her kid is only 9 so even if it was a short marriage Grayson was a significant part of his life (and for all we know, he's been around for longer than the kid can remember). Of course he's going to have possibly formed very real and important attachments. Grayson just.. disappearing(?).. without a real goodbye could be seriously damaging. It's not like he was doing anything nefarious or even trying to further his relationship with the kid, he was saying *goodbye*. \n\nI really hope Dad is involved and is a genuinely healthy parent. This poor kid is going to need at least one parent who isn't.. OP.\n\nI detest the using children as pawns as well. I agree on the \"privilege\" part too but I think it can also serve as a sort of \"punishment\" to the ex. And/or OP is really just so self-absorbed they give zero fucks about any of it, other than what she wants. In any case, she's putting her own wants above the emotional needs (and grasp of healthy attachment) of her 9 year old. Eurgh.", "\"Star-spangled fuck\" I'm stealing that, that's hilarious. Agreed though, she needs a reality check and some help.", "Actually... I don't think she did. In fact, I don't think she thinks of her kid at all when making any decision.\n\nMaybe Dad should be getting more custody here....", "Unfortunately, I\u2019ve met them. I\u2019ve met parents just like this who can\u2019t separate their strong feelings about the ex/marriage failing from what is actually best for the child."]}
