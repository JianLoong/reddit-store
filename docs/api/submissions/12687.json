In between working, I had to take my son to his pediatric cardiologist twice a month, then he had two cardiac caths before his open heart surgery.  Then after the open heart surgery, he started having seizures which the pediatric neurologist thought the seizures came from the shock to his mind of having the open heart surgery and being tied down to the crib so that he wouldn't move and pull the tubes out of his chest.  That was the hardest thing I had to do as a Mom, watch my son strain against the straps and trying to cry but couldn't because he had a breathing tube in his mouth and down his throat and I couldn't pick him up to comfort him.  When my son was in second grade, I had my daughter.  I stayed in the hospital after birth for one day and back then (1992) that wasn't the norm but there was no one to watch my son to give him his cardiac and seizure medications correctly.  Then after my maternity leave was over, I went back to work and when I got off, two days a week, I had to drive to their daycare center, pick up kids, drive all the way back to the hospital I worked at so that my son could receive his speech therapy.   While I appreciated any help that my Mom and Stepfather provided, it was left all on me.  The only time I got any free time or help was during the holidays because they had many days off while the hospital never close and I had to work.  Or they would take my kids with them to Alabama and Texas when they went on vacation during the summer for two weeks.\n\nMy story isn't the only story of what single Moms go through but we did it and many of us didn't/don't feel entitlement to any family helping.

NTA but ur wife certainly is", "NTA You and you wife chose to have a baby and her sister did not. Nobody owes your wife child care.  Any child care from anyone else is a gift, if you\u2019re even lucky enough to get it.  Babies and children are work.  Often exhausting work.  If your wife didn\u2019t want to take care of a baby she shouldn\u2019t have had one.", "NTA.

That's not a quality one usually looks for in a babysitter.", "Nta. Why would it be on her sister to help? Esp if she doesn't want to? Your wife sounds insufferable & entitled. She doesnt get to decide that having a baby is too much work then force someone else (besides the other parent) to step in & do some of the work & responsibilities. Whats worse is the sister has made it clear that she isn't interested in having more kids. You need to step up & help your wife more & please dont have more", "NTA - I didn\u2019t realise your wife had a baby with her sister. Not the sisters baby, not her responsibility. She did not consent to this situation.", "Asking for help is fine, not respecting the \"no\" is not.

This is your first child. It sounds to me, your wife trusts her sister a lot and thus the pressure to want more help from only her. \n\nYou are right to tell your wife to ease up. In addition to remind your wife the role that P wants in your family. The next is to start building a community needed for you to raise your child. Surround yourself with the people who are best to help you raise your family. \n\nIt\u2019s overwhelming with the first child, as you want the perfect help, especially with like minds as yourself and ones that you trust. I don\u2019t know if you plan on sending your baby to a daycare, but the emotions and pain watching your little one cry as you leave them with carers. \n\nBest advice is start finding your community.", "NTA, P did not sign up for this kid.", "NTA", "Does your wife usually help your sister as well?

Her insistence that you're taking her sister's side kind of misses the point.\n\nPerhaps she's just too sleep-deprived to be rational right now?

Your SIL is 100% justified in why she doesn't want to do it, and doesn't need to explain why.\n\n\nYou taking a stand for SIL is \ud83d\udcaf what should be done.", "Nta sounds like she wants to have the kid for the sake of having a title but doesn\u2019t actually want the kid and therefore bugs others for help because it\u2019s a burden.

Never missed a birthday or Christmas, but was never forced into spending time with us, caring for us, etc. My parents had us, she didn't.\n\nAnd if she'd been forced to? She would have gone NC. We had a good relationship when I was younger because she never begrudged seeing us when she came to visit my Mum, her sister. \n\nYour wife does have unrealistic expectations and needed to be told as much.

That sounds dangerous, and entitled on your wife's part.\n\nGood for sticking up for your SIL.", "NTA. You're 100% correct. If your wife wants her sister to go non-contact she's oing the right way about it. The baby is not her sister's responsibility.", "The important thing for kids is to have contact with as many trusted/safe/supportive adults as possible so that if there is something you can't tell your parents about then there is an adult you can tell.

While I understand that \u201cit takes a village\u201d automatically expecting someone, even a family member, to take on the responsibility of assisting with childcare when they were not the one that decided to have a child is presumptuous and unfair.

Hell, she has had 2 kids and I helped a bit here and there but to look after a 4 month old regularly, yea I'd distance myself too.   \nYour wife is entitled and way out of wack as to what is normal and expected", "ANY expectations on someone else to take care of your child are unrealistic. \n\nNTA.", "NAH. People need help when a newborn comes in. The myth of the strength of the nuclear family is BS. Since humans began to exist we live in at least band level societies.

Took me too long to find this. OP should evaluate how much he is (or isn't) helping. If they truly do not have friends or family that will help (which is so sad) then they should hire help. Or the dad should step up", "This is such a terrible attitude to have. Why call anyone family or friends if you cannot rely on them to help you in  a time of need?", "It is so sad that you are getting downvoted. Why call someone family if they won't help in an emergency? The attitudes of everyone on this thread are so selfish.", "Exactly. And the thing that entitled parents tend to miss is that they are part of the village for everyone's children. I love the village mentality, but it doesn't mean all adults I know are centered around MY children. It means my family is one of many in a group and we all help each other. When my 3rd kid was born a week after my husband broke his leg, our friends and family brought us meals and took my older kids out for the day. Now my babies are a bit older, I help my sister with her newborn because I have experience, and have friends kids over to play while they have to work late. It takes a village is about give and take, not gimme gimme gimme.", "People probably feel entitled to a village instinctively, to be fair. It is just natural for human societies to be more collective. Our cult of individualism is new and incredibly damaging. Human children are clearly meant to be raised by a tribe larger than two adults. The fact that people can do it without as much support today is a testament to the efficacy of social welfare, including public schools, which is really just an indirect way of relying on the biggest tribe to ever exist. \n\nWhen one or two people are forced by circumstances to raise children without other adults to help out, it is really difficult. It takes a toll on the parents, which does impact their ability to be the best parents they could be otherwise. Some children are also more resilient than others, but the ones who are not will suffer more from the lack of well rounded support and parents who are mentally and emotionally taxed to their limits.", "Situations are different. When my third was born, my oldest was only 5 and my husband had a broken leg. I don't know what I would have done without our village. But now my family is in a good place it's our responsibility (kids included) to give back to the community which has helped us.", "Exactly!", "Right? Don't hamd me a baby, I will hand it back. But, I will also show up with food in Tupperware, or come do some chores so that you can actually nap while baby naps, or run errands for you so you don't need to drag the kid. I'll even, once kid is good at entertaining themselves in their play pen, sit nearby watching for emergencies so you can shower. But do not expect me to change diapers or stay w baby alone for hours. And don't keep asking once I've said no, or I'm gone.", "And the kids help out too. My oldest daughter will help out the elderly lady who held her as a newborn.", "Nannies get paid though"]}
