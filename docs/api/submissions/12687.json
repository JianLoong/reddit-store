P to put it simply is not a baby person, she doesn\u2019t want kids but has always been supportive during the pregnancy.

I told my wife that her expectations are unreasonable given she\u2019s always known how P has felt about kids and she needs to let it go and apologize before we lose P from helping us completely in the future.

You chose to have a baby. Her sister was not a part of this choice and owes her NOTHING.", "NTA. Regardless of how P feels about children, she has ZERO obligation to help out with your child. Your wife is acting entitled and she\u2019s she\u2019s creating the opposite of what she wants. She\u2019s repelling P away.", "NTA. I cannot wrap my head around people having babies and expecting those in their circle to help. They didn\u2019t have that baby. If your wife wasn\u2019t ready for children she shouldn\u2019t have had a child \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right - P has made it clear where her boundaries are, and while it\u2019s hard to have a new baby, that doesn\u2019t make it any one else\u2019s responsibility. \n\nThe whole \u2018you\u2019ll change your mind when the baby\u2019s here\u2019 thing is bs and it\u2019s a shame your wife is driving her sister away", "NTA. Does she view her family as people with their own lives and values, or does she view them as free labor whenever she wants? Y'all shouldn't have had a kid if you didn't know how much work it would be.", "NTA but your wife is. Expecting people to help take care of your own child is stupid. On top of that, she knows how her sister feels about kids but still expects it???? Naaaahhh man, your wife is the AH here.", "NTA. Something needed to be said before your wife completely damaged her relationship with her sister beyond any repair. I just hope you did speak up soon enough and P will eventually be willing to come around again. It seems that your wife has forgotten that the burden of having children is the responsibility of the parents, not the parent's sister.", "NTA. Yes, your wife's expectations of her sister are unrealistic. As hard as it is for your wife to understand why her sister doesn't want kids or want to help more - that's just how she is. Some people are just like that.  Some people get really nervous or uncomfortable being around babies. When the baby is a little older she may want to be more involved. I know how hard it is being new parents and the two of you definitely need an occasional break, but like you said she knew that going into it how her sister felt about babies. When the baby is a little older, I bet it will be different. Good luck. Everything will be ok.", "NTA but your wife is.\n\nYour child, your responsibility to raise them. Your SIL has absolutely no responsibilities in relation to your child. \n\nYour wife sounds entitled if she thinks the rest of the world should be falling at her feet to look after the Golden Child. Was she the spoilt one when she was younger?\n\nYour view is the correct view, no-one owes you anything in regards to the life you two chose to bring into this world. If she wasn't prepared for the work, she shouldn't have had a child.", "NTA, but your wife is. It is unreasonable and selfish to expect a thing like that. It is her baby and yours, she did not help you create him/her, or did not have any say in this. It is up to you and her, it is your \"burden\" you created (although this sounds very weird given we are talking about your child), and yours and hers to carry.  If the sister  volunteers, OK, but she doesn't and it is making her uncomfortable. Your wife is the AH in that, and you are doing a good thing if you want to make her stop. I'd be grossed out by such an attitude from my sister.", "NTA. Lol. She should leave her sister alone.", "NTA Your wife's expectations are unreasonable. Not everyone is comfortable around infants and small children. And, her sister is not her nanny. She's her sister and she may not like how her sister feels about the situation but she needs to respect it. Nagging her sister has created a wedge between them and she needs to back off and stop being demanding.", "NTA she needs to get over it and not ruin her relationship with her sister and between your kid and her aunt. Hire a sister.", "NTA your wife ignored her sister\u2019s boundaries and lost y\u2019all childcare help. She needs to change her expectations before she completely ruins her relationship with her sister.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand people besides your wife. No one is ever obligated to help with a baby unless they are the parent or guardian", "NTA. The baby is the responsibility of you and your wife. If she needs a break then you guys might have to hire some help for a few hours or turn to other people. I\u2019m not great around kids. My rule is pretty much to only babysit kids that can talk and tell me what\u2019s wrong.", "NTA, assuming you\u2019re doing your share as the father. Being responsible for a child, especially an infant, is hard work. P knows this and didn\u2019t have one. You\u2019re right. But: your wife is very likely overwhelmed by the abrupt change in all aspects of your lives, and postpartum hormonal and physical changes can be really tough. She may need to hear you recognize that she\u2019s overwhelmed and work with her to figure out ways to get some additional childcare so you can be adults for a few hours.", "NTA for what you said. You\u2019re absolutely right. I don\u2019t see why your wife thinks someone else should be helping relieve this burden? A baby is a total burden, 150%. And you guys decided you wanted one for whatever reason, so it\u2019s your burden to deal with. \n\nI really disliked that the reason you said she should apologize to P though, was so that you get some help from her in the future. Stooooooop! P doesn\u2019t like babies. She doesn\u2019t want a baby. She doesn\u2019t want to care for kids. She never ever has to do any of that for you. Never.", "NTA. You understand your SIL\u2019s side and told your wife the truth. Sounds like she just didn\u2019t want to hear it.", "NTA\n\nthis is your child and your responsibility. It\u2019s nice to have babysitters every once in awhile so you can rest or go out. It\u2019s nice for the you and your spouse to switch up responsibilities so that you each get some rest. I personally think your wife is unhinged for assuming that her family would step in as regular caregivers to your child.", "NTA. If your wife is typically entitled and demands that other people solve her problems for her, that's one thing. If acting this way is uncharacteristic for her, maybe a PPD screening would be appropriate. It's absolutely not your SIL's responsibility to care for someone else's baby, but is this maybe the (toxic) way that your wife is communicating that she is overwhelmed?", "NTA. \"*given she\u2019s always known how P has felt about kids...\"* Your wife is being unreasonable. She can't force her sister to like or want to take care of a baby. Sister has clearly stated that she feels uncomfortable doing so. All your wife is accomplishing is driving her sister away.", "NTA - you're right and your wife is being a jerk to her sister over this. I get your wife is tired but you are the only one who owes her help because this is your baby too. Any help that parents, siblings, other family/friends provide is gravy and should be accepted with gratitude. If limitations on that help make the help not useful then politely decline.", "Poor kid.  The mom just can\u2019t wait to them off on others.  Why\u2019d she have a baby?", "NTA. She needed to be told that. And also you\u2019re dealing with someone with insane hormones. Be as understanding as possible but also be truthful.", "NTA. You are 10000% right. She is going to hurt her relationship with her sister over this.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is wrong for thinking her sister should babysit or help care for the baby. The baby is not your SIL's responsibility.", "NTA and she's currently ruining your chances of her sister helping out more when the kid is bad.", "NTA. Was your wife the favored child growing up? I can\u2019t understand why she\u2019d feel so entitled to her sister\u2019s life, she\u2019d assume your sister would be willing to turn into a free babysitter.", "NTA. Your wife is only seeing from her perspective and not respecting her sister\u2019s boundaries at all. You guys both chose to have a baby and while it\u2019s nice to have family and friends help on occasion, the responsibilities and burdens still fall on you both. It\u2019s not P\u2019s baby. Being an aunt does not equal being a third parent.\n\nAlso, it seems since P is the older sister, I\u2019m guessing your wife was used to getting things her way? Not that all family dynamics are like this but parents tend to be harsher on the eldest daughter.\n\nu/throwawaywifesister Do you and your wife pay or compensate in other ways for P\u2019s time when she did babysit? How often and how long did P babysit per week?\n\nEdit: Added questions for the OP.", "NTA for \u201cpicking the sister\u2019s side\u201d but indeed you could have let your wife sort out the mess she is creating without taking sides.\n\nHaving said that, your wife should back off not because you will lose all help but because she is alienating her sister. And she is being an a-hole by having any sort of expectations from a person that 1) has made her boundaries perfectly clear and 2) has no responsibility to your child.\n\nHaving a baby is exhausting and it gets a bit easier if you have a village but you cannot force anyone to be part of your village.", "NTA\n\nNewborns create a level of stress and fatigue that cannot be explained, only experienced. So the place your wife is coming from is understood.\n\nIts just truth that for tough babies or folks uncomfortable with babies, the ask of watching the baby just isn\u2019t a good ask. Our first was a GIRD baby. When her tummy hurt, she could belt it out for quite a while. Asked my brother and his wife to watch her while we went shopping for a couple of baby items. It wasn\u2019t an hour before they called us, baby wailing in the background, asking when we could be back, and that was fair of them, they didn\u2019t know what to do!\n\nYour sister in law could perhaps be supportive without doing what makes her uncomfortable. Seeking some help in other ways could maybe be a solution?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At first glance it's an NTA because you were right to tell your wife she's being unreasonable about P's involvement.\n\nBut then I noticed YOU used the phrase 'to take the burden off of us.'

A child *is* a burden no matter how much you love them. A financial burden, an energy sink, mentally and emotionally draining. All of those things are the real consequences to having a child.

A child is a burden. A burden that most people are willing to take while others are not. You dont have to like every part about parenthood just because you are a parent. You dont have to pretend everything is going super well just because you are a parent. You dont have to pretend you are always happy and not exhausted from parenthood because youre a parent.
