So they have set it , like they would be living there forever; Appliances , water heaters, loads of furniture, all cooking related things etc.They go there every other weekend to just clean the place, water the plants and other house related stuff. Sometimes they don't find any help at short notice and they end up cleaning the entire house by themselves. And while leaving they also cover up a few things , since dust tends to settle quite easily at that place. \n*We don't have a caretaker as there were incidences of the caretakers letting the apartments for some groups and those groups ended up trashing that place.(not ours, this was told to my parents by the neighbours)\nSince then my mother refuses to give the keys to anyone who isn't one of the four of us. (Not even her siblings or closest friends)\n\nNow this place also sees a fair tourist movement  on most weekends.\nIt so happened that I ended up mentioning about going to this place in passing , to one of my consultants.( I mentioned since I wanted leave that weekend) So there was a short discussion about planning a trip to that place since I already own a house there, and that was that.(we only discussed but no concrete plans were made) \n\nA few months later , one of my colleagues called up ,(out of the blue, we had not spoken for quite some time before that) saying that they would like the keys to that house as he will be going back to his home town after a short holiday at my place.\nAlthough I was on good terms with this colleague, we were not close. And my parents had already told my sister and I , that we can go there with our friends but atleast one of us has to be there. \nSo I asked him , which days he wanted to go , so that I could free up my schedule accordingly.\nBut then he said , I was not needed and I could just give him the keys and they will return them to me once they are back in town.\nSo I told him that one of my family has to be around and that I cannot hand him the keys like that.\nHe got upset and hasn't spoken to me since then.( Not that I particularly miss talking to him, but I don't like to be on bad terms with my colleagues usually. Professional hazard) \nHappened again with another senior. \nI have always maintained that it's our home not an AirBNB type of situation and guests are welcome when one of us is around.\n\nSo I was wondering if AITA?", "created_utc": 1681133310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hiu1t/aita_for_not_letting_my_colleaguesfriends_use_my/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
