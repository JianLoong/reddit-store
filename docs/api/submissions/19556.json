My doctor has told me not to do any yardwork whatsoever because I have an allergic reaction every time. Full body rash and swollen joints for like a week. Wearing gloves and protective clothes has not helped. \n\nMy husband knows all of this. Yesterday he mowed, and pressured me into helping him rake up grass and weeds.

Against my better judgement I thought that if I just raked and didn\u2019t physically touch anything I would be fine. I didn\u2019t want to refuse him when he insisted. \n\nToday I have a rash all over and a lot of swelling and I feel like shit. I normally meal prep for the next week on Sundays. This morning I half assed threw me some salads in Tupperware for next week and called it a day. I eat a lot of easy stuff that doesn\u2019t require cooking so it\u2019s fine. My husband on the other hand eats like 15 pounds of meat a week as well as vegetables and sides. It usually takes me hours to cook his food and it\u2019s very draining. \n\nI told him he needs to cook his food for the next week, because I\u2019m too tired and my skin feels awful. He got mad and said he\u2019d just eat takeout since he wants to relax on his last day off. So now I have to freeze all the meat so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. He only cooks once or twice a year. \n\nHe thinks it\u2019s not fair for me to not feed him since I agreed to rake and it isn\u2019t his fault I had an allergic reaction.
