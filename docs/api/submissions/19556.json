I (26f) am allergic to a plant that lives in the state my husband (29m) and I have moved to. We aren\u2019t sure which plant yet but are narrowing it down kinda. My doctor has told me not to do any yardwork whatsoever because I have an allergic reaction every time. Full body rash and swollen joints for like a week. Wearing gloves and protective clothes has not helped. \n\nMy husband knows all of this. Yesterday he mowed, and pressured me into helping him rake up grass and weeds. I didn\u2019t want to and I mentioned that I could have an allergic reaction but he said that he needed help and that I would be fine. Against my better judgement I thought that if I just raked and didn\u2019t physically touch anything I would be fine. I didn\u2019t want to refuse him when he insisted. \n\nToday I have a rash all over and a lot of swelling and I feel like shit. I normally meal prep for the next week on Sundays. This morning I half assed threw me some salads in Tupperware for next week and called it a day. I eat a lot of easy stuff that doesn\u2019t require cooking so it\u2019s fine. My husband on the other hand eats like 15 pounds of meat a week as well as vegetables and sides. It usually takes me hours to cook his food and it\u2019s very draining. \n\nI told him he needs to cook his food for the next week, because I\u2019m too tired and my skin feels awful. He got mad and said he\u2019d just eat takeout since he wants to relax on his last day off. So now I have to freeze all the meat so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. He only cooks once or twice a year. \n\nHe thinks it\u2019s not fair for me to not feed him since I agreed to rake and it isn\u2019t his fault I had an allergic reaction. Im not trying to punish him but I\u2019m really suffering right now and I just don\u2019t have it in me. I also do think it wasn\u2019t fair for him to pressure me into doing something he knows I medically shouldn\u2019t do. \n\nAITA for not feeding my husband?\n\nEdit: dang you guys really hate my husband haha. He\u2019s actually a pretty decent guy, I think this post just portrayed him in a bad light. He works 80 hours a week to support me while I go to school, and he still manages to do at least half of the cleaning. I talked to him and he said his back was just hurting and he was stressed out from work and he wasn\u2019t thinking. He apologized and brought me dinner while I layed on the couch. I\u2019m not doing his meal prep this week because I really just can\u2019t but we both came to terms with it. He\u2019ll feed his self and I\u2019ll try to manage my skin as best as I can. It looks awful and feels worse. He\u2019s not a lazy guy, he works hard to make things up in other areas, he just hates cooking. Which, to be fair, I hated yardwork even before we moved to this shitty state where I\u2019m allergic to everything.", "created_utc": 1686508612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1471igg/aita_for_not_feeding_my_husband_because_he_caused/", "score": 1924, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
