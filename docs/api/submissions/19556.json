He can make his own food. It's your weekend too. why he want's you to spend your last day off cooking for him?", "NTA.  He knows you are trying to figure out what you are allergic to.  You had a medical reason not to do the raking.  He should not have bullied you into helping with the raking.  You have the horrible consequences of helping, and he is now experiencing the inconvenient easy consequence of not having you prep his meals for the week.   I am so angry that he expects you to cook when you don't feel well.  He is choosing not to cook.  Please do not feel guilty that you are not up to feeding him.  He is a grown man.  I hope you can treat yourself to something nice when this latest allergy attack is over.  Please don't help next time.  You may have an allergy attack that is even worse next time.", "NTA, and you are entitled to not meal prep for him any damn time you want regardless of what else is going on.", "Please please please rethink this relationship. He insisted you put your health at risk and then blamed you for risking your health and convinced you it\u2019s your fault and he shouldn\u2019t have to take responsibility for the choices he pressured you into. This is a form of abuse and you\u2019re falling for it hook, line and sinker. \n\nPeople like him don\u2019t improve, they only get worse. Are you able to move out and away from him? Have you got family or friends you can stay with? \n\nPlease if you can, speak to your doctor at your next appointment and tell them how you are being treated at home.", "You need to move back to whatever, (safe for you to actually exist outside),  place you came from.\n\nYour husband and his pounds of meat can rot.  \n\nHe technically *did* cause you to have an allergic reaction.

It's really bad he pushed you into helping with the yard knowing you are still trying to work out what's giving you the reaction, so that makes him an AH but.... on the cooking thing.\n\nIt doesn't matter how the reaction kicked off.  Even if it had been nothing to do with him, even if it had been something completely different - you are unwell.  It's completely unreasonable for him to expect you to do anything that you don't feel upto.    Partners support each other for better and worse, and that goes both ways.  He should be making the food for you (even if if your food is simple).  It's what partners do for each other.", "NTA\n\nEven if he hadn't caused an allergic reaction (which he did), he is a full-grown adult with the ability to cook for himself. If he doesn't know how to, he looks for a tutorial online and leaves you out of it. You are not his servant.", "NTA but you do realize how abusive your husband is. You are just a cook, and a bang maid to him, because if he gave a damn about you he would not have let you anywhere outside knowing you have an sever allergic reaction.\n\nHonestly see the big red flag and run girl. This is not a man that will but your well being about his wants and needs! He cares more about himself then you. He is showing exactly how much he cares about you and his true colors!", "INFO: Why did you not put your health first and decline to rake? You have severe reactions that could escalate during any exposures.", "NTA and tbh I'd be questioning the relationship because it doesn't sound like he cares much about you and just expects you to do everything for him?", "NTA - for not feeding your husband who is a moron. He convinced you to help with the yard work knowing that you would have an allergic reaction. That is abusive. It is his fault you are having an allergic reaction. \n\nLet him fix his own damn meals.

Him being a baby about having to cook for himself is ridiculous.", "Find family or friends to stay with and talk to a divorce attorney. He does not care about you or your health.", "NTA.
