She clearly always favoured the Sdaughter over the kid she gave birth to which is kinda sad. Maybe this will give her own daughter the motivation to push OP out of her life. I\u2019m surprised the mom was even invited to go to her wedding. Well if OP don\u2019t go to her wedding there is no reason to have a relationship with her nor let the grandkids meet grandma either. And in a few years OP will be back on this sub or another asking why her own daughter won\u2019t talk to her. Well these comments give you a better insight why she will not want anything to do with OP. \n\nEdit: OP said SDaughter doesn\u2019t care to go to the wedding, and was only surprised she wasn\u2019t invited to the ceremony. So idk why you care OP, you\u2019re just pushing your own daughter out of your life and will wonder why she won\u2019t talk to you anymore.
