{"id": 2296, "submission_id": "yuz19l", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she can\u2019t go to her dream school but paying for my son to go to his?", "selftext": "I\u2019m 49m and I have 2 children, Jake (23) and Nikki (17). Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades.\n\nJake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure.\n\nNikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment. \n\nI\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites. \n\nI feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself. Am I wrong?\n\nEdit to answer a recurring question:\n\nI thought I made it clear but apparently I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not limiting Nikki\u2019s education to $20,000 a year. I told her that\u2019s the max I\u2019m willing to pay for her education degree. I\u2019m more than happy to pay $75,000 a year if she picks another degree that will have a better return. For a while she thought about being a doctor and fell in love with England (we have family there) so I even offered to pay for her to go to Oxford which will be double the cost of her brother\u2019s tuition. But she\u2019s adamant about being a middle school teacher and I\u2019m unwilling to spend $300,000 that I worked hard for on an education degree.", "created_utc": 1668431657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuz19l/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_cant_go_to_her/", "score": 5214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't expect him to do you?\n\nWhat about your daughter? Does she have to pay you back?\n\nBecause, if not, why are you doing this? It is favoritism if you are not expecting to be paid back. Period. Honestly, it's favoritism regardless. A successful career isn't all about money and your view that it is is very ancient. A successful career is one that makes you happy. And you're telling your daughter that her dreams don't count.", "YTA. Please reconsider, OP. You're thinking solely in fiduciary terms. Let's nevermind favoritism or sexism for a moment. Your daughter's passionate about becoming a teacher. Society desperately needs good, well-trained, committed teachers. Investing in her education is just as likely to payoff in social benefit as your son's is in terms of salary. Income isn't the only consideration here. Support her. It will not only pay off in social benefit, but she will always be grateful (as, I hope, your son is) rather than feel shortchanged.", "YTA.  To be fair, you should at least pay what you are paying for your sons education and let her take out student loans for the rest.", "YTA. You do favour Jake. Just because Jake's potential career could earn him more money does not make him more deserving than Nikki. \n\nYou'd rather Nikki have shedloads of debt and earn less, than earn less with less debt? Make it make sense! For someone obsessed with financials, you don't seem to actually care about her financial position. Seems more about controlling what she does to me.\n\nYour kids are your kids. Not 'investments'. \n\nYou do realise that Jake might not be a dentist right? He could end up going into teaching and educating the next generation of dentists. He could even do a u-turn and pursue a completely different career. Are you going to ask him for a refund if he were to do this?", "YTA\n\nYou are clearly favouriting your son here, he\u2019s following the family traditions and your happy to take on a load of debt for him but you won\u2019t do the same for your daughter because her career choice is a \u201cproblem\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll only take on debt for your child if they do the careers YOU want them to do. \n\nGo back to your daughter before you lose her", "YTA.

Your daughter will be doing a job that is absolutely necessary. That job (teacher) is the sole reason your precious son is able to go get a six-figure job after college. Teachers are notoriously overworked and underpaid and she won't be able to afford to pay back student loans as easily as your son. You're a pretty horrible dad for even asking this to be honest. That is the most blatant sexiest favoritism I've ever seen in my entire life.", "Info:\n\nYou keep saying \u201cinvestment\u201d. Define investment. What exactly are you investing in?\n\nAre your kids paying you back for their education? Because this is the only reason you should care what they end up making in salary. \n\nWhile I totally agree that the skills required to be a teacher can probably be picked up at any state-level college, and that\u2019s insane to spend that much money on a college particularly for a teaching degree, I don\u2019t really understand how you are affected by how much they make at their jobs. \n\nSince it doesn\u2019t sound like you expect them to pay you back, nor does it sound like you can\u2019t afford both schools, then your investment really has nothing to do with finances and everything to do with their happiness. \n\nOf course your daughter is going to claim favoritism. Because you are, in fact, favoring your son\u2019s choice of a career over your daughter\u2019s. \n\nI get your points but from where I\u2019m standing (and most importantly where your daughter is standing) YTA.\n\nMaybe a more diplomatic approach would be to make a deal with your daughter - let her know she can choose between her choice of school OR a state school with the stipulation that you\u2019ll finance her first home. \n\nThat way, you aren\u2019t paying favorites and you give her the option of making the right decision. A first-time home is a significantly better investment than an expensive school - particularly with regards to the field she\u2019s going into.", "YTA, and Nikki is right that you favor your son.\n\nYou should make equal amounts of money available for them, and let them figure it out from there.", "You can do what you want with your money, but YTA for your reasoning.", "Tell me you have a favourite child without telling me you have a favourite child.

Because to you love is conventional\n\nOh and If I didnt make it clear YTA\n\nEdit: \nAs Ive talked to people and getting different point of views Ive come to a different conclusion of softer yta (no longer major) I still think that your daughter should go to a university she chooses (based on location, good prospects etc etc) but since apparently (thank you americans in the comments who have a greater grasp on this then I) it makes no difference where you get the degree e.g. comminity or ivy. I think you should give your daughter a cut of budget? Or take her around to different community colleges to see that they are still really good and she can get what she needs there.", "YTA.  Newsflash: life isn't all about money, and your kids are not intended to be some sort of high-yield investment strategy.  Your daughter wants to take on a pretty noble job, and you're gonna belittle her because it isn't lucrative?  You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA for giving them unequal support. You're telling her that because she wants to enter a lower-paid profession, you're going to give her less money than her brother. \n\nI agree with you that it doesn't make logical sense for her to spend 300k for a teaching degree. I'm a teacher myself and there's not a significant difference in quality between a good state school and a private college. However, it's completely unfair for you to give them different amounts of support. \n\nYou need to provide her with the same amount of support you gave your son. It sounds like that will not be quite enough for her dream school, but more than enough for the state school. Then I would work with her to try to convince her that the state school is the best choice. In order to maximize her future salary, she's going to need a master's degree, either initially or later on, and since her salary will be lower, it makes sense for her to save some of the money for a down payment. But ultimately, you need to support her to the same degree as her brother or this will have life-long consequences for your relationship.", "YTA for having a favorite child and making it completely obvious. I feel so bad for your daughter. Teachers are good enough to teach your children (even all the way through dental school) but they aren\u2019t good enough to be part of your family?", "YTA. You\u2019re definitely favoring your son here. Why can\u2019t you just match what you\u2019re giving him so she can pursue her dreams at the school she wants too? They\u2019re both going to need degrees to do their jobs, so belittling her career choice does make me wonder if sexism might be at play here. Even if her education takes longer to pay off afterwards, that doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t get to enjoy her college experience and reap the benefits of working so hard in high school.", "YTA these are your children, not your stock portfolio", "YTA for favoring one kid over the other..\nWhat if your son doesn\u2019t make it as a dentist and you wasted all that money?!", "YTA.\n\n> he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area\n\nAnd what if he decides he wants to move somewhere else and focus on helping patients who can\u2019t otherwise afford dental care?  What if, as others have already pointed out, he decides he doesn\u2019t want to be a dentist after all?  \n\nSet a consistent upper limit for what you can afford regardless of major, and let *both* kids figure out the difference from there.  But if you really think the solid \u201cinvestment\u201d here is \u201cbase your career around what *I* think you should do to maximize your earning potential, not what you can actually see yourself doing for the rest of your life,\u201d you need to rethink your priorities.", "YTA and stop hiding your blatant favoritism behind money. Also, you sound judgmental af.

Add on to that union benefits and summers off and your daughter\u2019s salary should look much more than how you are quantifying it.\n\n\nNot that any of that matters.

That includes one friend who started out school thinking they would be a dentist (and had family members in medicine), and went on to pursue a very different (but ultimately successful) career.\n\nI had another friend who wanted to be a writer (in a subject area where they were able to acquire a lot of experience through an internship during school), but after a few years, decided to go another way. I have another friend who became a successful editor and is now considering a mid-career change. The truth is, no matter how passionate your son and daughter are around their respective career interests right now, you have no idea how those interests and passions will change in the years to come.\n\nIf your son decides that he hates being pre-med and wants to do something else, will you then suddenly consider that a poor investment? Will he have the freedom to change his mind and his career path if it comes to that?

I also wanted to be a teacher.  My dad told me he was happy to pay for my education but I needed to major in something that paid above poverty level (at the time in our area - teachers were paid very very little).

I think since he paid he had the right to have some say", "Wow you're walking a very fine line here.\n\nNTA. \\*It is obscene to spend $300k to go to a fancy private school to be a middle school teacher, full stop.\\*HOWEVER if you want to be fair you should put aside the difference between what you spend on your son and her, then use it to help her afford things later in life like a downpayment on her own place, a car, a fancy wedding, etc.", "NAH\n\nI don't think this is necessarily favoritism, but I can see why your daughter feels like it is. The US education system is really messed up, colleges are way too expensive and teacher wages barely seem to justify the cost. I think it is a smart consideration, if the more expensive schools are really necessary and to discuss this with your children not only in a short term, but also long term way. At 17, it might be hard to fathom how much money something costs, how long it would take to break even and how it impacts life long term. \n\nAssuming you don't view paying for education a loan, but a gift and if you can afford it, maybe try to come up with a total sum of what you want to give your children as a \"setting them up for a successful life\"- fund. That sum can be eaten up completely by education (in case of your son) or be used for a house, semeser abroad, wedding, whatever. It should come out to the **same total and be explained to both children**.\n\nDon't risk any misunderstandings on what the total is and who receives what, so your son doesn't want to get the down payment for a house after seeing his sister getting one, because her education cost less. \n\nSit down with your daughter, look at the advantages and disadvantages of the different colleges/ their costs/ their influence of job chances/ quality of life during college together. Try to be open to her opinion and view this an opportunity to tackle a project together. If she has all the info and still wants to go to the expensive college, that's her choice. Not providing her with the same money as your son would definitely give her room to feel like you don't value her career choice, her education and therefore her as much as her brother.", "YTA - your logic about their respective income potentials doesn\u2019t even make sense. You\u2019re willing to pay more to the kid who is more likely to be able to pay off student loans after college than the one who might struggle with them?

Your daughter is passionate and teachers who are passionate are in short supply.

I wouldnt be surprised if she goes LC or even NC with you soon.", "YTA. No more needs to be said really.", "YTA plain and simple. You are favouring one child over the other because he will get a higher salary. You clearly have no regard for her happiness.

If you\u2019re committed to not spending that money on a lackluster degree, consider investing the difference between what you spend on your son\u2019s education and hers in an account in her name - this will give her a down payment on a house later on - or something to show that you were willing to invest the money but not to just spend it.\n\nOne other thought is that the name-brand school might pay off if she meets & marries an equally wealthy guy there. No guarantees, though. (And while I wish I were kidding here, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s a practical consideration.)\n\nI\u2019m giving you NTA bc you\u2019re right.

Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades.\n\nJake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure.\n\nNikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment. \n\nI\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites. \n\nI feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself. Am I wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I hate parents like you so much.\n\nAlso, if you want to be calculating so much, college fund is a thing you **have to provide for each of your child** as a parent, and to make things fair you should give her the same amount you're paying your son and let her take it from there. Or just let them **both** take loans ffs. This reeks favoritism so much smh", "YTA -\n\nPaying for the studies should consider the value add to your child. A teaching degree is a MARVELOUS contribution to society - and your child would never be able to pay back that debt on a teachers salary - so arguably, your daughter needs and deserves he help more!\n\nYour son, on the other hand - has a less expensive program that he would be able to pay back himself - so - while dentists are valuable to society; he doesn't actually need your help nearly as much.\n\nYour treatment towards \"Teachers\" and your value on income rather than contribution to society is painful to read and reeks of a capitalistic dystopian nightmare.", "Yes, you\u2019re wrong. So your son is PLANNING on being a dentist with a nice starting salary. Do you think he\u2019s giving any of that to you? Has he agreed to pay you back? What if he doesn\u2019t like it?  What if he changes his mind? What if he meets somebody special and drops out to do something else? \n\nUnless your plan is for your kids to pay you back, then what does their salary matter? If you want, make it equal. Son gets X amount per year for school. Daughter gets the same. If that amount pays for your sons schooling, then fine. If it doesn\u2019t pay for your daughters schooling, then she can take out loans or find a different school. \n\nYou\u2019re also paying for post-grad for your son. Offer your daughter that same amount if she wants to get a masters. \n\nYou clearly favor your son, and you clearly see teaching as a \u201cless than\u201d profession.

Look at it this way, your daughter has a better chance of getting her loans forgiven.", "Why does it look like you view your kids as nothing but accounting lines on an excel spreadsheet and not humans?", "YTA in what world does it make sense to pay entirely for the child who will make enough to pay back loans easily,  but not for the child who's equally valid career won't.\n\n\nYour poor daughter.", "I'm going to withhold judgement cause I don't know the dynamic between you and each of your children. \n\nFinancially I agree with you. As someone who did an advanced degree with a starting salary of $100k, all my student loans felt worth it cause I could survive. Also undergraduate degrees are overpriced, filled with enough fluff to waste as much time as possible and most people don't make it through. (I say that as someone who worked as a TA for years to pay my graduate degree and who taught organic chemistry and regularly ended the dreams of premed, predental and pre-vet students). \n\nBut I think you need to consider that one aspect of the cost-benefit analysis that you're missing is a good relationship with your daughter.  She may retaliate against this perceived injustice by cutting you off or resenting you forever (she might still do that even if you pay and apologize). \n\nSo I think if you want to repair this relationship, then you need to pick better goalposts to ensure her success in the future which is what I'm perceiving to be your return on investment. \n\nFirst, talk financial and offer compromises, she can attend the same university as her brother and it'll be fully paid. Or option 2, she attends her dream university which is double the costs but she has to have a job related to her field while she does and pay for any expenses outside of tuition. Or option 3, since most teachers nowadays need a master's degree, then you'll pay for the cheaper undergrad but will also pay for the masters. \n\nTell her you love her and that you're sorry that she felt like you disrespected her life choices. But if you're hellbent on not paying for that university or judging her for choosing her own future, then be prepared for a life cut off from your daughter. It's a new era and people have no problem cutting off toxic family members, try not to be one to your daughter .", "I think this says more about the way we view teachers than anything else. YTA and reading this made me really sad - there's so much that goes into being a good, successful teacher from praxis to curriculum history, to social and racial issues. Teachers can go on and oversee whole educational programs and get a Masters. \n\nThis idea that because teaching doesn't make a lot of money doesn't deserve as much of your resources is quite frankly, absurd. Where would we be without the compassion, know-how, and determination of teachers? Who would your kids be if they had a teacher that tore them down and made their experience in the classroom hell?\n\nSorry this has gotten so long, but the lack of appreciation we have for teachers and teachers education is a huge problem and honestly, probably does have root in sexism.

It's true that a name brand/dream school doesn't provide a better education than many state schools (often students are just paying for the name and the football team). Ivy league schools can open doors and are an exception. Many state colleges were founded as teacher colleges and excel at training teachers.

They're also right that depending on the location, teacher salaries in the US can be very low (I'm in NYS which has one of the highest teacher salaries, but in some states teachers are barely making poverty wages) and it is important to consider the costs of education.

Even veteran teachers rarely make 6 digits, and if she got a job in an environment where she could work at said prestigious schools, then it'd be worth it cost wise.\n\nBut if you got it, flaunt it. He **can afford it,** he just doesn't want to and thats the part that isn't fair. Because being realistic, she is as likely to get a position there without a networking reference as a kid would to get a scholarship to one of these schools unless shes at the very top of all her classes.\n\nThats for her to determine or for her to achieve. Beyond my judgement.\n\nHe should offer them both the same college funds and post graduate gifts and let them make their financial independence from there. Wash his hands. Let them care for themselves and explain they will no longer be dependants after college, if hes that concerned about her earning potential. \n\nIm sure they both have allotted trust funds and can draw from there when allowed (if he doesnt then he needs to set them up) and they should make their own way. \n\nWhat I can't realistically see is her being the kind of person who spends 300k on a degree and suddenly be comfortable subsisting on 55-60k a year for the next decade or however long it takes for a prestigious university to take her in.\n\nI doubt she has and real scope of her lifestyle costs vs earning potential. \n\nThis is also beyond my judgement, but the likelihood im wrong is low enough I feel comfortable making the assumption.\n\nSo yes, this is a ton of money for something that doesnt need to be that expensive, and she could use it elsewhere for better purposes, but he should acquiesce and let her forge her own path to success.\n\nIf you don't want to be responsible for her going forward past college, lay the ground work now and hold your son to the same standard. College sum, graduation sum, trust fund, youre on your own after that.\n\nTLDR: I still think its a ridiculous sum to spend for what shes getting and the liklihood she will be independently capable to the lifestyle she prefers is **exceptionally low** even if YTA, but you should afford your kids the same opportunities.", "Yeah, because the university you go to totally has no influence whatsoever on your future employers.

There are several ways to approach college, and what OP describes is financially practical. The reality is, teaching programs are widely available. A secondary education bachelor's program is typically a certificate program that follows a structured curriculum that includes pre-candidacy and candidacy experience. There is little variability in the curriculum from school to school within a specific state. \n\nHowever, there is much more variability in pre-dental and dental programs. Dental programs are highly competitive, so attending a pre-dental school offers an early assurance or direct acceptance, which will increase the applicants chances of getting into the program. Dental programs also require students to complete additional research, volunteering, job shadowing, and work experience. \n\nMy advice to OP and his daughter would be to find what is specifically different about her dream school's teaching program vs. the state school and weigh the cost-benefit analysis. Talk to the department heads and see where their students are going post-graduation. Are they employed? Do they return for a master's? Are they working in public vs private schools? What are the average salary differences? Where are they interning? How does their field experience impact their career choices post-graduation?\n\nCollege is an investment here in America.

That way it would show her it's not about favoritism and really just about not believing spending that amount of money for an underpaid degree is worth it. It would also offset her lack of income. \n\nPut it up as an option. She either picks a better career and you fund that. Or gets her dream job and housing assistance.

Your daughter's resentment points to a lack of respect she has for you, and that was probably your fault somewhere along the line.\n\nIt would be better to give them both responsibilities instead of blank handouts. Have them take out loans first, and then promise to help them pay down their loans once they graduate. This ensures that they are both extremely motivated to complete their degrees, since they are solely on the line for the costs if they choose to drop out. Plus it would greatly benefit their credit scores. You should offer to co-pay the loan a certain percent of their salary every year. That should put the end goal in more perspective - and might motivate them both to seek high paying jobs, rather than just coast.
