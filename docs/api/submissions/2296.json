Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades.\n\nJake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure.\n\nNikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment. \n\nI\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites. \n\nI feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself.

You don't expect him to do you?\n\nWhat about your daughter? Does she have to pay you back?\n\nBecause, if not, why are you doing this? It is favoritism if you are not expecting to be paid back. Period. Honestly, it's favoritism regardless. A successful career isn't all about money and your view that it is is very ancient. A successful career is one that makes you happy. And you're telling your daughter that her dreams don't count.", "YTA. Please reconsider, OP. You're thinking solely in fiduciary terms. Let's nevermind favoritism or sexism for a moment. Your daughter's passionate about becoming a teacher. Society desperately needs good, well-trained, committed teachers. Investing in her education is just as likely to payoff in social benefit as your son's is in terms of salary. Income isn't the only consideration here. Support her. It will not only pay off in social benefit, but she will always be grateful (as, I hope, your son is) rather than feel shortchanged.", "YTA.  To be fair, you should at least pay what you are paying for your sons education and let her take out student loans for the rest.", "YTA. You do favour Jake. Just because Jake's potential career could earn him more money does not make him more deserving than Nikki. \n\nYou'd rather Nikki have shedloads of debt and earn less, than earn less with less debt? Make it make sense! For someone obsessed with financials, you don't seem to actually care about her financial position. Seems more about controlling what she does to me.\n\nYour kids are your kids. Not 'investments'. \n\nYou do realise that Jake might not be a dentist right? He could end up going into teaching and educating the next generation of dentists. He could even do a u-turn and pursue a completely different career. Are you going to ask him for a refund if he were to do this?", "YTA\n\nYou are clearly favouriting your son here, he\u2019s following the family traditions and your happy to take on a load of debt for him but you won\u2019t do the same for your daughter because her career choice is a \u201cproblem\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll only take on debt for your child if they do the careers YOU want them to do. \n\nGo back to your daughter before you lose her", "YTA.

Jake is going to his preferred college for free and Nikki is not.", "INFO: you say it is an investment - do you mean an investment for them to have a good life or are you expecting to see something back eg being provided for in your old age years or being paid back the money?", "YTA, if anything, your son should be paying for his own school, because he'll be making six figures right out the gate and can afford the student loans. Your daughter will be doing a job that is absolutely necessary. That job (teacher) is the sole reason your precious son is able to go get a six-figure job after college. Teachers are notoriously overworked and underpaid and she won't be able to afford to pay back student loans as easily as your son. You're a pretty horrible dad for even asking this to be honest. That is the most blatant sexiest favoritism I've ever seen in my entire life.", "Info:\n\nYou keep saying \u201cinvestment\u201d. Define investment. What exactly are you investing in?\n\nAre your kids paying you back for their education? Because this is the only reason you should care what they end up making in salary. \n\nWhile I totally agree that the skills required to be a teacher can probably be picked up at any state-level college, and that\u2019s insane to spend that much money on a college particularly for a teaching degree, I don\u2019t really understand how you are affected by how much they make at their jobs. \n\nSince it doesn\u2019t sound like you expect them to pay you back, nor does it sound like you can\u2019t afford both schools, then your investment really has nothing to do with finances and everything to do with their happiness. \n\nOf course your daughter is going to claim favoritism. Because you are, in fact, favoring your son\u2019s choice of a career over your daughter\u2019s. \n\nI get your points but from where I\u2019m standing (and most importantly where your daughter is standing) YTA.\n\nMaybe a more diplomatic approach would be to make a deal with your daughter - let her know she can choose between her choice of school OR a state school with the stipulation that you\u2019ll finance her first home. \n\nThat way, you aren\u2019t paying favorites and you give her the option of making the right decision. A first-time home is a significantly better investment than an expensive school - particularly with regards to the field she\u2019s going into.", "YTA, and Nikki is right that you favor your son.\n\nYou should make equal amounts of money available for them, and let them figure it out from there.", "You can do what you want with your money, but YTA for your reasoning.", "Tell me you have a favourite child without telling me you have a favourite child.

Newsflash: life isn't all about money, and your kids are not intended to be some sort of high-yield investment strategy.  Your daughter wants to take on a pretty noble job, and you're gonna belittle her because it isn't lucrative?  You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA for giving them unequal support. You're telling her that because she wants to enter a lower-paid profession, you're going to give her less money than her brother. \n\nI agree with you that it doesn't make logical sense for her to spend 300k for a teaching degree. I'm a teacher myself and there's not a significant difference in quality between a good state school and a private college. However, it's completely unfair for you to give them different amounts of support. \n\nYou need to provide her with the same amount of support you gave your son. It sounds like that will not be quite enough for her dream school, but more than enough for the state school. Then I would work with her to try to convince her that the state school is the best choice. In order to maximize her future salary, she's going to need a master's degree, either initially or later on, and since her salary will be lower, it makes sense for her to save some of the money for a down payment. But ultimately, you need to support her to the same degree as her brother or this will have life-long consequences for your relationship.", "YTA for having a favorite child and making it completely obvious. I feel so bad for your daughter. Teachers are good enough to teach your children (even all the way through dental school) but they aren\u2019t good enough to be part of your family?", "YTA. You\u2019re definitely favoring your son here. Why can\u2019t you just match what you\u2019re giving him so she can pursue her dreams at the school she wants too? They\u2019re both going to need degrees to do their jobs, so belittling her career choice does make me wonder if sexism might be at play here. Even if her education takes longer to pay off afterwards, that doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t get to enjoy her college experience and reap the benefits of working so hard in high school.", "YTA these are your children, not your stock portfolio", "YTA for favoring one kid over the other..\nWhat if your son doesn\u2019t make it as a dentist and you wasted all that money?!", "YTA.\n\n> he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area\n\nAnd what if he decides he wants to move somewhere else and focus on helping patients who can\u2019t otherwise afford dental care?  What if, as others have already pointed out, he decides he doesn\u2019t want to be a dentist after all?  \n\nSet a consistent upper limit for what you can afford regardless of major, and let *both* kids figure out the difference from there.  But if you really think the solid \u201cinvestment\u201d here is \u201cbase your career around what *I* think you should do to maximize your earning potential, not what you can actually see yourself doing for the rest of your life,\u201d you need to rethink your priorities.", "YTA and stop hiding your blatant favoritism behind money.

Add on to that union benefits and summers off and your daughter\u2019s salary should look much more than how you are quantifying it.\n\n\nNot that any of that matters.

Paying the extra 25K for 4 years will still be much less than what you will pay for your son.", "YTA You're playing favorites.", "I went to a fairly prestigious university for undergrad, and I knew a LOT of people who started out thinking they wanted to pursue one career, and wound up pursuing another (myself included). That includes one friend who started out school thinking they would be a dentist (and had family members in medicine), and went on to pursue a very different (but ultimately successful) career.\n\nI had another friend who wanted to be a writer (in a subject area where they were able to acquire a lot of experience through an internship during school), but after a few years, decided to go another way. I have another friend who became a successful editor and is now considering a mid-career change. The truth is, no matter how passionate your son and daughter are around their respective career interests right now, you have no idea how those interests and passions will change in the years to come.\n\nIf your son decides that he hates being pre-med and wants to do something else, will you then suddenly consider that a poor investment? Will he have the freedom to change his mind and his career path if it comes to that?

The US education system is really messed up, colleges are way too expensive and teacher wages barely seem to justify the cost. I think it is a smart consideration, if the more expensive schools are really necessary and to discuss this with your children not only in a short term, but also long term way. At 17, it might be hard to fathom how much money something costs, how long it would take to break even and how it impacts life long term. \n\nAssuming you don't view paying for education a loan, but a gift and if you can afford it, maybe try to come up with a total sum of what you want to give your children as a \"setting them up for a successful life\"- fund. That sum can be eaten up completely by education (in case of your son) or be used for a house, semeser abroad, wedding, whatever. It should come out to the **same total and be explained to both children**.\n\nDon't risk any misunderstandings on what the total is and who receives what, so your son doesn't want to get the down payment for a house after seeing his sister getting one, because her education cost less. \n\nSit down with your daughter, look at the advantages and disadvantages of the different colleges/ their costs/ their influence of job chances/ quality of life during college together. Try to be open to her opinion and view this an opportunity to tackle a project together. If she has all the info and still wants to go to the expensive college, that's her choice. Not providing her with the same money as your son would definitely give her room to feel like you don't value her career choice, her education and therefore her as much as her brother.", "YTA - your logic about their respective income potentials doesn\u2019t even make sense. You\u2019re willing to pay more to the kid who is more likely to be able to pay off student loans after college than the one who might struggle with them?

I\u2019d say your are going above and beyond for paying their tuition and living expenses, regardless of location. Your son is lucky to get the school of his choice, but that alone should not make your teenage daughter ungrateful for the opportunities before her. If you blatantly said you wouldn\u2019t pay for your daughters college no matter the location, you would be the asshole. Not to judge, to me your daughter sounds slightly entitled. Perhaps talk to her about how financial decisions matter greatly in today\u2019s world, and how without your prior financial decision making, you wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for college at all.", "YTA!

If you want both of them to be able to do what they are currently passionate about (and fyi, lots of teens change majors once they actually start college), then if you only pay for one kid jt should be your daughter. \n\nEither way though, you should pay the same amount for both and stop judging them based on what they think they want for the rest of their lives when they are seventeen. \n\nYTA", "NTA !

If you\u2019re committed to not spending that money on a lackluster degree, consider investing the difference between what you spend on your son\u2019s education and hers in an account in her name - this will give her a down payment on a house later on - or something to show that you were willing to invest the money but not to just spend it.\n\nOne other thought is that the name-brand school might pay off if she meets & marries an equally wealthy guy there. No guarantees, though. (And while I wish I were kidding here, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s a practical consideration.)\n\nI\u2019m giving you NTA bc you\u2019re right.

Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades.\n\nJake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure.\n\nNikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment. \n\nI\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites. \n\nI feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself.

I hate parents like you so much.\n\nAlso, if you want to be calculating so much, college fund is a thing you **have to provide for each of your child** as a parent, and to make things fair you should give her the same amount you're paying your son and let her take it from there. Or just let them **both** take loans ffs. This reeks favoritism so much smh", "YTA -\n\nPaying for the studies should consider the value add to your child. A teaching degree is a MARVELOUS contribution to society - and your child would never be able to pay back that debt on a teachers salary - so arguably, your daughter needs and deserves he help more!\n\nYour son, on the other hand - has a less expensive program that he would be able to pay back himself - so - while dentists are valuable to society; he doesn't actually need your help nearly as much.\n\nYour treatment towards \"Teachers\" and your value on income rather than contribution to society is painful to read and reeks of a capitalistic dystopian nightmare.", "Yes, you\u2019re wrong. So your son is PLANNING on being a dentist with a nice starting salary. Do you think he\u2019s giving any of that to you? Has he agreed to pay you back? What if he doesn\u2019t like it?  What if he changes his mind? What if he meets somebody special and drops out to do something else? \n\nUnless your plan is for your kids to pay you back, then what does their salary matter? If you want, make it equal. Son gets X amount per year for school. Daughter gets the same. If that amount pays for your sons schooling, then fine. If it doesn\u2019t pay for your daughters schooling, then she can take out loans or find a different school. \n\nYou\u2019re also paying for post-grad for your son.

As someone who did an advanced degree with a starting salary of $100k, all my student loans felt worth it cause I could survive. Also undergraduate degrees are overpriced, filled with enough fluff to waste as much time as possible and most people don't make it through. (I say that as someone who worked as a TA for years to pay my graduate degree and who taught organic chemistry and regularly ended the dreams of premed, predental and pre-vet students). \n\nBut I think you need to consider that one aspect of the cost-benefit analysis that you're missing is a good relationship with your daughter.  She may retaliate against this perceived injustice by cutting you off or resenting you forever (she might still do that even if you pay and apologize). \n\nSo I think if you want to repair this relationship, then you need to pick better goalposts to ensure her success in the future which is what I'm perceiving to be your return on investment. \n\nFirst, talk financial and offer compromises, she can attend the same university as her brother and it'll be fully paid. Or option 2, she attends her dream university which is double the costs but she has to have a job related to her field while she does and pay for any expenses outside of tuition. Or option 3, since most teachers nowadays need a master's degree, then you'll pay for the cheaper undergrad but will also pay for the masters. \n\nTell her you love her and that you're sorry that she felt like you disrespected her life choices. But if you're hellbent on not paying for that university or judging her for choosing her own future, then be prepared for a life cut off from your daughter. It's a new era and people have no problem cutting off toxic family members, try not to be one to your daughter .", "I think this says more about the way we view teachers than anything else. YTA and reading this made me really sad - there's so much that goes into being a good, successful teacher from praxis to curriculum history, to social and racial issues. Teachers can go on and oversee whole educational programs and get a Masters. \n\nThis idea that because teaching doesn't make a lot of money doesn't deserve as much of your resources is quite frankly, absurd. Where would we be without the compassion, know-how, and determination of teachers? Who would your kids be if they had a teacher that tore them down and made their experience in the classroom hell?\n\nSorry this has gotten so long, but the lack of appreciation we have for teachers and teachers education is a huge problem and honestly, probably does have root in sexism.

Dad's explanation literally makes zero sense.", "That the kids realize the return doesn\u2019t negate it.", "That his children are realizing the ROI does not negate them.", "300k for \\~4y of /maybe/ happiness is a god damn steep price. I 100% agree college is an INVESTMENT towards the REST OF YOUR LIFE. If all you get out of college is 4 years of fun you've fucked it up badly.", "If you need to pay out 300K for your child\u2018s happiness, something is seriously wrong. \n\nEither way, OP shouldn\u2019t be playing favorites like this. Give both kids the same amount, let them attend whatever college they want and study what interests them, and let them figure out the rest themselves.", "This should be one of the top comments!", "There are a lot better ways to buy happiness than paying for an expensive college.  I remember being in high school and thinking I absolutely had to go to a prestigious university; I did, it didn't make me happy, and it didn't make a big difference to my career (as far as I can tell).  My sister who went to community college for her associate's and then transferred to a four-year school to finish her bachelor's spent a lot less money and is doing no worse than I am career-wise.", "Not just happiness, but refusing to pay for her while paying for her brother will create serious emotional damage that will affect her for the rest of her life. She must feel so discarded and unloved.", "That the kids realize the ROI does not negate the value of the return.", "If the plan is to teach in a public school, her university will have no influence on her salary, and she\u2019ll likely get hired regardless of where she earns her degree.\n\nThat\u2019s just the reality of being a teacher in the US.", "For undergrad? It really doesn't have that much of an impact. Unless you are planning to go into specific fields where there is a really specialized program at one school over another it doesn't make much sense to go to an Ivy League school except for developing connections for future career opportunities... Which really aren't as critical for people entering education as a career.\n\nI mean OP absolutely still YTA for not setting aside equal funds for your children and favoritism and putting down your daughter's choices. It's just that the daughter's choices are less than optimal for ROI. (Doesn't mean they aren't valid though).", "It really makes almost no difference unless she wants to be a professor. Even then it is only for street cred.", "Tbh, if she's teaching middle school, where you go for undergrad really doesn't matter.", "The harping on about family tradition and treating his son as an 'investment' is a red flag in my eyes. I'd bet dollars to donuts op is less invested in the daughter because she won't carry on the family name and stay 'his'. Without further explanation or his thoughts that's speculation on my part but it gives me those kinda vibes.", "But what's unfair? Why would you go to a school of 75000 dollars that's gonna teach you the exact same thing as the school who's costing 20000 dollars?\nIs everything about money and wanting to have the exact same thing? Who's to say he gives that money when she's done to buy a nice house ? The son won't need it because he will get it from work while she's doing what she loves but has to be careful what to buy\n\nOp is only talking about the education not about giving or not giving the exact amount of money.\nIt's his money and both should be grateful that he's willing to pay for their education.\n\nIf he's pulling favorite then he would pay for her and he would pay if she chooses to become something with a higher payroll in the end of the day.", "> My sister became a dentist and I became a nurse. Does that mean I should have gone to a cheaper university because Im going to earn less?\n\nI mean, honestly, yeah. That would probably be a sound financial decision.", "It's not about that.\nAll middle school teachers have to learn exactly the same thing do why paying 75 a year when the other school ask 20? Why should he throw away money? \nYour right about good teachers but the daughter wants to teach middle school he's not saying that if she wants to go further that he won't pay he's just saying no to paying more for the same stuff", "And you think it isn\u2019t the same for teachers? Do you really think no one cares if a teacher got out of Harvard instead of a smaller university?", "What?", "Thank you, I just can\u2019t fathom when a parent will only do something for their child if they think their gonna get something out of it eventually, that\u2019s not why you become a parent", "She\u2019s 17, she has all the time to change her plans. The problem is that op has no respect for the job she wants to pursue, as if having good teachers ins\u2019t necessary to become a dentist.", "Not only the us but everywhere", "And if she plans to teach at a private school she'll make even less money, making the fancy degree an even bigger waste of resources.", "But what Im saying is he got to go to his chosen school (son) daughter isnt being given the right to go to her chosen school. Which I can understand now seeing that it is gunna cost 75,000 (which is more then the son and I can see how thats unfair) However. Why does she have to go to the community college 2 hours down the road? Cant she have the same opportunity to go to a good university for 50,000 (same as the son). I just dont understand why he is allowed to but she isnt. It seems he is valuing the children based on what will happen afterwards. \n\nIn England most full time universities cost the same (as in courses I believe) whilst living will be more expensive depending on where you live (oxford and london universities will be more expensive then leeds or Coventry) \n\nBesides are teachers more likely to get a good paying job if they come from a good university (again british not american so I dont know how it works out there)", "Good thing I live in the uk then where university fees are the same and so me and my sister could had equal opportunities. As I said before I dont live in the US and these cost are unfathomable to me (same with the situation) but from an outside looking in, who has had the opportunities I have had, and having the same situation e.g. the professions me and my sister chose. I would go with a verdict of AH.", "She can always change her mind, like it often happens in college. She\u2019s 17 for god\u2019s sake. She could get an excellent education and move somewhere where teachers get a better salary, maybe even in another country. Punishing her because op has no respect for teachers in unfair. In Germany teachers have really high salaries for example. She could teach English in Germany.", "That's the reality of being a teacher, yes.", "And if Reddit is anything to go by, it usually backfires spectacularly.", "It\u2019s not that he has no respect. It\u2019s that he\u2019s looking at potential return-on-investment - and teachers will never earn enough to justify a $300k undergraduate education.", "Nope. Op said he is also gonna pay for dental school so thatll be way more.", "Well why would you pay for a top school when the same thing is learned at the cheaper one and knowing that you pay more for 1 year than what she will ever make? Maybe there is no school between the 2? I don't know. But i think  lot are thinking he won't give her the money later on when i thinks thats not the case at all because i wouldn't pay for the 75000 college but i would give her when she's done and my son wouldn't because he already got it", "It isn't punishment were does op says if she changes her mind that he won't pay? He's just saying why paying more when it's the same stuff she's learning?\nOp is 100% right i would do it either because it's ridiculous.\n\nYou would pay 50.000 dollars more for the exact same thing?", "This \\^\\^\\^", "Children are not an investment FFS.", "I agree I wouldnt pay the 75000 either in the uk I would be able to go to university at least twice on that. I do disagree with you there and where you say alot of people believe he wont give her money he is clearly showing he is still willing to pay for her university. But it doesnt sound like he is willing to compromise and let her go to a university more then 20,000. If he is willing to let her go to a university of her choosing between 20,000 and 50,000 a year (that being the cap because that is what the son gets) then he wouldnt be AH. But if he is limiting her to 20,000 because she \"Is just gunna be a teacher\" then I stand by what I say that he is an AH. Because that not only down grades the daughter and says 'being a teacher isnt good enough' (I couldn't be a teacher they have horrible hours, have to deal with angry parents and dont get paid for the holidays and often or not have to pay for there own supplies) but also in my opinion (just mine) plays favourites.", "Op isn\u2019t a teacher, he doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to learn the same things. The same can also be said about dentistry, you learn the same things in every university, why does the son get the better treatment?", "I don't think that's what he meant buy maybe op can clear this up.\nSo i still going with NTA until I learn that he indeed gives a max to 20.000", "Op doesn't have to be a teacher it's worldwide known that's every teacher of a certain class needs to know the exact same thing.\n\nAbout the dentist thing you correct but again were does it states that there is another school who's cheaper? \n\nYou guys assuming things i only react based on what op is telling.", "I agree. I will whole hearted change my answer to NTA is OP can clarify if he meant that the max was 20,000 and comminity college is the only card on the table. But if that is the case I stand by my argument that he is a major AH and paying favourite.", "So in the whole country there isn\u2019t a single cheaper school than op\u2019s son\u2019s dream university? I don\u2019t live in the USA, but I honestly find it extremely hard to believe. Op is clearly favoring his son because he is following the family\u2019s tradition, and holds very low respect for the profession his daughter chose, despite it being extremely important.", "I agree...OP needs to clarify what he means exactly", "Apparently not but as you can read the prices are ridiculously.\n50.000 when he's gonna make a minimum of 120.000\nVs\n75.000 when she's gonna make a max of 60.000\nOr\n20.000 when she's gonna make a max of 60.000\n\nDon't think it'd only the tradition because i would look only at the above and would'nt pay and let her go to the 20 and give her the money when she's done"]}
