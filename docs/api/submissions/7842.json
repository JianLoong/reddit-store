One screamed through the ceremony and the mom would not leave the chapel because she did not want to cause a fuss. There were no problem Xtra places for them at the reception so their parents had to shar their food with them. The worst was the kid that wanted a cupcake off the table the wedding cake was on. He lost tipped the wedding cake onto the floor. My dad saved it but there was a handprint on the lowest tier and a lot of cupcakes hit the floor.\n\nAll in all it was four families that brought uninvited children.\n\nMy wedding invitations just went out over Christmas. We are getting married in May. I know this is a long time but we have a lot of out of town, country, and even continent guests we hope will come.\n\nWe did not invite these families to our wedding. We have a Facebook group for the wedding for people to share pictures and memories that we might put in the wedding video. They found out about the group and posted to my personal page about being excluded and asking why we are not inviting them.  I messaged them privately and asked them to take down their posts and explained that my wedding was smaller and I wasn't having as many guests as my sister. They went public again and bitched about me excluding them for no good reason. So I post d the receipts. I posted a video my cousin sent me of the kid crying during the ceremony and the parents doing nothing. The video of the kid freaking out because he had to share trout for supper. The before and after pictures of the wedding cake table. And I also asked of they knew in advance that they were not supposed to bring their kids to the wedding. Then everyone started piling on. To them. I guess there was a lot of stuff I missed. Including one of them changing a kid on the table with the guest book because the closest bathroom did not have a baby station.\n\nNow they are all calling me an asshole for embarrassing them for having children and wanting to be part of family events. I said that they could not understand why rules were in place and that is why they were not invited. My uncle posted about how embarrassed he was that his daughter was one of these entitled jerks and offered to pay my sister for the cake that got wrecked.

There was too high a probability that one of her kids would cause a problem so I didn\u2019t invite her. I have 20+ cousins and less than half were invited so it shouldn\u2019t have been a huge deal that she didn\u2019t get an invite but 2/3 of her brothers were invited and I guess she was mad. Her mom/my aunt begged my mom to convince me to let her bring that cousin\u2019s 12ish yo daughter because she really wanted to come for some reason.

No one is entitled to a wedding invitation. Ever. And if the kids weren\u2019t mentioned on the invitation, they WERE NOT INVITED. So frickin rude to show up to an event you weren\u2019t invited to. \n\nFor redditors who are perusing this thread who are also thinking of hosting a kid-free wedding:\n\nI suggest having a kid area with an on-site baby sitter that\u2019s at the venue, but tucked away. I did that at my wedding. They had pizza, coloring sheets, and Disney movies to watch. Parents didn\u2019t have to worry about the expense of a sitter, were nearby in case if emergencies, and the kids weren\u2019t subjected to a boring wedding for grown ups. Everyone wins. \n\nA friend liked the idea so much she did the same thing for her wedding.

No. There's a difference between \"I have children and am at a wedding and doing my best to keep them contained\" and \"my children being here is more important to me than your wedding.\" We had a relatively child-free wedding. Our nieces and nephew's entire staff of babysitters (you know, uncles and aunts, grandma and grandpa) were all there, and we weren't about to uninvite our sisters. My SIL stepped away when the baby started fussing. Everyone entertained their own kids, and the families came together to group-parent and make sure nothing went awry. None of this had to be addressed beforehand. It should be common knowledge to gtfo if your kid is screaming during a wedding. I cannot express how ENRAGED I would be if someone let their kid NEAR my cake table without a hand firmly gripping their shirt. No, I wouldn't want those people at my wedding either. Could you have been more polite? Sure. \"We have had bad experiences in the past with children at weddings...\" yadda yadda yadda while everyone still knows exactly what you mean vs receipts. Now maybe they'll learn their lesson. I'd dogpile on them too, that's unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't embarrass them, they embarrassed themselves.", "NTA.  They set themselves up for this.", "NTA If they didn't want them reason to be public, they shouldn't have made a stink about it in public. Now they have to deal with the consequences. Perhaps they should behave better and take better care of their kids", "NTA - Some of your family members publicly asked you why they were excluded, and you tried to stay private by messaging them separately. They couldn't take your answer as \"good enough\" and continued complaining about the situation (YOUR wedding). Your wedding guest list honestly has nothing to do with anyone but you and your partner. \n\nI don't think you were unwarranted in your approach - you were simply reporting the evidence as to why you didn't want kids at the wedding. Honestly, more than what they deserved at that point after publicly complaining about not being invited. Very nice of your uncle to offer to pay your sister for the cake!", "NTA they made things public first", "NTA, they demanded an answer why they weren\u2019t invited and you gave them the answers along with video and visual proof that YOU were not being an asshole to them and their children, but in fact quite the contrary, THEY were the disrespectful Asses that already managed to Fu@k up your sister\u2019s wedding and you were not even going to take that chance at your own wedding.", "NTA.

I would never have brought them to a child free wedding in the first place, but if kids were allowed, I still wouldn\u2019t do any of those things. If my kid cried or misbehaved, we would have gone out until they could calm down.

I\u2019m Bangladeshi, and we have multiple wedding functions (a minimum of four, but usually 6) with THOUSANDS of guests, hundreds of whom are children, and I\u2019ve never seen kids act this way making such a fuss and ruining things. All the kids, including mine, are super excited but they know when they can approach the dessert tables, not go near the engagement or Holud cakes, and generally stay busy playing with each other without causing any harm. Yes, our venues are huge but cake is cake to kids everywhere! What are these parents teaching their kids?", "I guess your question is also culturally bound. Personally I can't imagine purposely excluding some family members from my wedding based on their age. I get that it's acceptable in your culture, but to me that sounds really hurtful. If you exclude young family members, is it then OK to exclude old family members who maybe have dementia or Parkinson's and may also accidentally disrupt the ceremony or knock over a cake? How about family members with Tourette's who can blurt out sounds during the ceremony? What about obese or disabled family members who look \"bad\" in photos? I don't know, to me family is family. Unless someone is purposefully trying to ruin the wedding or make you feel bad, it feels cruel to exclude them on the basis of something they can't (fully) control, like their age.

They brought their own food for her as she wasn't old enough to be able to eat a lot of the food there. They were wonderful. \n\nHowever, I have one entitled cousin who demanded his children come to my wedding.  The problem is they are highly allergic to most food. So my entire menu would have to be catered to them so I said no. So what did my cousin do? He called my wedding venue to try and get the menu changed, and when that didn't work he tried to get separate meals made especially for his kids (that I would pay for). Not an easy thing for any commercial kitchen to accomplish.\n\nI put my foot down and said that they aren't coming and if he can't accept that don't come.
