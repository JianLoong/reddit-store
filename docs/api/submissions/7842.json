She sent gracious note to everyone who sent their regrets and thanked them for understanding her desires for her wedding and respecting them enough to RSVP in the negative. She also invited them to a party later that summer at her home if they wanted to take pictures with her and her wedding party in their fancy clothes.\n\nI thought it was well handled and classy.\n\nSeveral people did not understand the meaning of \"child free\" and brought their kids anyways. One screamed through the ceremony and the mom would not leave the chapel because she did not want to cause a fuss. There were no problem Xtra places for them at the reception so their parents had to shar their food with them. The worst was the kid that wanted a cupcake off the table the wedding cake was on. He lost tipped the wedding cake onto the floor. My dad saved it but there was a handprint on the lowest tier and a lot of cupcakes hit the floor.\n\nAll in all it was four families that brought uninvited children.\n\nMy wedding invitations just went out over Christmas. We are getting married in May. I know this is a long time but we have a lot of out of town, country, and even continent guests we hope will come.\n\nWe did not invite these families to our wedding. We have a Facebook group for the wedding for people to share pictures and memories that we might put in the wedding video. They found out about the group and posted to my personal page about being excluded and asking why we are not inviting them.  I messaged them privately and asked them to take down their posts and explained that my wedding was smaller and I wasn't having as many guests as my sister. They went public again and bitched about me excluding them for no good reason. So I post d the receipts. I posted a video my cousin sent me of the kid crying during the ceremony and the parents doing nothing. The video of the kid freaking out because he had to share trout for supper. The before and after pictures of the wedding cake table. And I also asked of they knew in advance that they were not supposed to bring their kids to the wedding. Then everyone started piling on. To them. I guess there was a lot of stuff I missed. Including one of them changing a kid on the table with the guest book because the closest bathroom did not have a baby station.\n\nNow they are all calling me an asshole for embarrassing them for having children and wanting to be part of family events. I said that they could not understand why rules were in place and that is why they were not invited. My uncle posted about how embarrassed he was that his daughter was one of these entitled jerks and offered to pay my sister for the cake that got wrecked. He had been unable to attend and hadn't heard about the cake.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1674244948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10h6nrp/aita_for_posting_the_reasons_that_i_excluded_some/", "score": 839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was too high a probability that one of her kids would cause a problem so I didn\u2019t invite her. I have 20+ cousins and less than half were invited so it shouldn\u2019t have been a huge deal that she didn\u2019t get an invite but 2/3 of her brothers were invited and I guess she was mad.

No one is entitled to a wedding invitation. Ever. And if the kids weren\u2019t mentioned on the invitation, they WERE NOT INVITED. So frickin rude to show up to an event you weren\u2019t invited to. \n\nFor redditors who are perusing this thread who are also thinking of hosting a kid-free wedding:\n\nI suggest having a kid area with an on-site baby sitter that\u2019s at the venue, but tucked away. I did that at my wedding. They had pizza, coloring sheets, and Disney movies to watch. Parents didn\u2019t have to worry about the expense of a sitter, were nearby in case if emergencies, and the kids weren\u2019t subjected to a boring wedding for grown ups. Everyone wins. \n\nA friend liked the idea so much she did the same thing for her wedding.

My SIL stepped away when the baby started fussing. Everyone entertained their own kids, and the families came together to group-parent and make sure nothing went awry. None of this had to be addressed beforehand. It should be common knowledge to gtfo if your kid is screaming during a wedding. I cannot express how ENRAGED I would be if someone let their kid NEAR my cake table without a hand firmly gripping their shirt. No, I wouldn't want those people at my wedding either. Could you have been more polite? Sure. \"We have had bad experiences in the past with children at weddings...\" yadda yadda yadda while everyone still knows exactly what you mean vs receipts. Now maybe they'll learn their lesson. I'd dogpile on them too, that's unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't embarrass them, they embarrassed themselves.", "NTA.  They set themselves up for this.", "NTA If they didn't want them reason to be public, they shouldn't have made a stink about it in public. Now they have to deal with the consequences. Perhaps they should behave better and take better care of their kids", "NTA - Some of your family members publicly asked you why they were excluded, and you tried to stay private by messaging them separately. They couldn't take your answer as \"good enough\" and continued complaining about the situation (YOUR wedding). Your wedding guest list honestly has nothing to do with anyone but you and your partner. \n\nI don't think you were unwarranted in your approach - you were simply reporting the evidence as to why you didn't want kids at the wedding. Honestly, more than what they deserved at that point after publicly complaining about not being invited. Very nice of your uncle to offer to pay your sister for the cake!", "NTA they made things public first", "NTA, they demanded an answer why they weren\u2019t invited and you gave them the answers along with video and visual proof that YOU were not being an asshole to them and their children, but in fact quite the contrary, THEY were the disrespectful Asses that already managed to Fu@k up your sister\u2019s wedding and you were not even going to take that chance at your own wedding.", "NTA. Some people hire bouncers to kick out anyone who shows up that aren't supposed to. Wedding crashers. Kids. Plus-extra (more than 1) Etc. More people should do it. Worth it.", "100% NTA. Your sister should\u2019ve had the invitation and had someone go up to each of these families and ask them to leave since this was a child free event. If not that she should have posted all the videos that were taken and thanking those families for ruining her wedding by bringing children to a non child event. If another child free event is scheduled you\u2019ll understand why you aren\u2019t invited.", "NTA. They disregarded a simple boundary and then behaved atrociously. I have 4 kids. I would never have brought them to a child free wedding in the first place, but if kids were allowed, I still wouldn\u2019t do any of those things. If my kid cried or misbehaved, we would have gone out until they could calm down. If there isn\u2019t a changing table, I would go to my car or use the changing pad in my diaper bag somewhere away from people and wedding decor. Some people are just so self centered. It\u2019s really mind boggling.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to handle this privately. Some entitled parents were making public noises and complaints. So you had to post a public rebuttal.\n\nSimply put, entitled parents who go into a child free wedding with their kids end up ruining weddings which have no planning for dealing with children.\n\nResponsible parents either don't go to child free weddings or arrange child care beforehand. And they wouldn't make public noises about your restriction.", "NTA\n\nchild free means exactly that and if they need picture or video proof of precisely why they aren\u2019t invited and it\u2019s embarrassing for them, well I guess that\u2019s what you have to do. Why do people feel the need to ignore requests thinking that it doesn\u2019t apply to them? Good for you for calling them out", "NTA", "He'll no you aren't the a**hole, People are allowed to have any rules they want for their wedding, and if those people don't like it they don't go, but they don't get too just ignore the rules and bring their children anyways and then act like they are a victim, and don't know why they aren't invited elsewhere.  Those people are TA", "NTA. You\u2019re a hero.", "I'm going against the popular here, but I think YTA because you lied to them.\n\nYou told them it was due to being a small wedding, likely to avoid drama, then publicly shamed them with the real reason, creating drama.\n\nIf you had been upfront with them, I'd feel different.", "Same! I\u2019m even willing to download FB to my phone again just to see all of this!\n\nEta - NTA", "damn, I would join Facebook just to see this group!", "Yes! Everyone needs a good petty giggle. They asked for the why and they got it\ud83e\udd23", "If it was on a subscriber-based platform, I'd pay to be a member", "Happy Cake Day!", "I have Facebook . Can I see please. I\u2019ll even make a post about how tasteless they are. Lol", "Yes! I have to read this!", "Same!! I\u2019ll even buy something off the registry.", "Me too", "Happy birthday\ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf82", "My family is Catholic so kids were a must cause my cousins have sooooo many. I will say though, the kids were really well behaved cause they were used to going to church. And we had babysitters for cocktail hour and the dancing afterwards. My suggestion is if you have to have kids, get babysitters and stick em in the bridal suite (just make sure you find a good place to stash your stuff).", "I have a kiddo, and I'll die on that hill too xD\n\nNTA, by the way", "It might well not have. It\u2019s like they become desensitised to their kids behaviour and don\u2019t realise that its disturbing everyone around them. \n\nAnd their reaction is basically: \u2018what you going to do - they\u2019re kids\u2019 well in this case the correct answer was not to bring them.", "They're rude for how they handled their kids. Not want to leave for fear of making a scene? Ironic since it was a crying child disrupting the ceremony to begin with.", "I am going to steal this, please and thank you.", "Yeah the uncle is amazing for offering to make it right when he learned about it!", "Me too!!! \ud83d\ude02", "Me three!", "Time to join Facebook! I held out until something good was on there and it is time!\n\n\nNTA", "I'll rephrase...their *children* sound horrible. And maybe even their parenting if they changed a baby on the table with the guest book.", "They already disrespected your sister. They will do the same to you if you relent.", "Ick. I wouldn't want parents who cannot control their offspring. \n\n\nThat's ridiculous.  Part of being a parent is teaching your children to behave. \n\nThey should be ashamed of themselves. \n\n\nNta and that's hilarious", "I offered to do exactly that, get the kids a babysitter and some pizza, but his sister basically said if her kids weren't allowed at the full wedding, the family wouldn't be coming. \ud83d\ude44it was almost ten years ago and whenever the wedding comes up people always ask about the screaming toddler like it was cute and adorable. Super glad that's what people remember lol", "You must have missed the post earlier this week. The bride went above and beyond for her childfree wedding. Setting up extra rooms for the kids, movies and games, little old church ladies to help out, babysitters...\n\nAnd all the parents still complained.", "You have my bow.  \n\n\nNTA", "Oh, the LoTR reference is just icing on the cake", "You should make the no children at the venue policy **very public**, and definitely have someone handling the door.", "Even if the kids don't show up, the parents might", "Yeah, we don\u2019t get enough of those type of endings here very often. It\u2019s always inspiring.", "[deleted]", "They also don't see actions the kids may take, or they might take with the kids, as others will. Using the guest book table to change a baby for example. The parent sees it as necessary because no changing tables in the bathroom, everyone sees it as a hygiene problem. Hope the cupcakes that wound up on the floor were extras.", "I would think that is where they need to have an individual conversation ahead of time with each pair of parents to establish expectations and reasoning. The way she chose to do it was to exclude family members and freinds, then publicly shame them. \n\nI hate a screaming baby or toddler in the middle of a concert or movie more than anyone but I can\u2019t help but thing her whole predicament could have been solved in a much better way. \n\nHer problem is no longer that she wants a child free wedding, her problem is seeing if anyone will show up at all.", "Me three! I'll have popcorn ready", "No you were right the first time. The baby didn't choose to be changed in public on a table in the middle of the lobby. These parents have no boundaries.", "The adults sound worse to me. They're the ones who ignored the very clear & respectful \"no children\" instructions, who didn't take their screaming kids out of the ceremony, who weren't watching them closely enough to keep them from climbing on the dessert table and knocking over the cake, who didn't bring age-appropriate food for their own children & instead tried to get them to share their wedding food, and who changed a baby's diaper on the guest book table... and in the end, they're the ones who raised these kids so even if it's the kids who are horrible, that's a reflection on the parents. Based on these stories (kids still in diapers, screaming during the service, trying to climb on a dessert table) it sounds like most of the kids involved were under 7 years old and at least some were under 3... parents are still responsible for their kids at those ages.\n\nNTA", "Well lets not blame the kids. Kids are very self at these ages, Its  up to parents to set them straight.", "The children aren't horrible, they're just children. Why are you blaming small kids for the decisions of adults?", "> *They will do the same to you if you relent*.\n\n....Or if you don't relent.  Make sure that you have a bouncer at the door.", "AND MY AXE!", "Why does OP have to speak openly about anything? They are adults, they should be mature enough to know that breaking rules and being entitled makes them unpleasant to have around. They don't seem to take criticism well, either. \n\nOP did give them an explanation. Maybe they smelled the bullshit or maybe not, but either way, the response was to shame OP publicly. Fuck them. Off with the kid gloves.", "I think you\u2019re confused about whose responsibility it is to arrange childcare.", "Willing to bet most, if not all the people she invited and have RSVPd will show up.", "> I would think that is where they need to have an individual conversation ahead of time with each pair of parents to establish expectations and reasoning.\n\nOP's sister tried, and the result was the entitled parents RSVP yes to the childfree wedding and then went like lol nope, gonna do whatever the fuck I want to anyway.\n\nFooled twice, shame on OP.", "I got the pizza! no pineapple tho", "I'll bring soda!", "Would you agree that it sounds like having these children there was horrible? I'm not attacking their presence I'm attacking the horribleness of having them there.", "I can not believe we are living in a world where we need bouncers at weddings because people can not behave like decent human beings.", "But I love pineapple on pizza! \ud83d\ude22", "And the children didn't decide to go, their parents brought them.", "Agreed.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many places nowadays that need bouncers.", "also at funerals...I mean, if I got dropped into the Regency period I'd be SOL pretty quick, but \"be nice to others\"  doesn't seem like such a high bar to clear...", "We had security at my school's play because some of the parents of the kids were in bad custody battles for various issues. There was a binder with photos of people not allowed in. I had the pleasure of having to deal with grandparents of one of my students who were adamant they be allowed in.", "Your school should have the school resource officer dealing with these people.  I hope that you were paid extra, OP.", "The alternative is they are not invited at all, fair or not.  OP did not come here looking to find a way to accommodate the people who are not invited.", "I\u2019ve been to several child free weddings where people managed to leave their children at home or declined to attend. \n\nThe plan was not bad, OP\u2019s family was just rude and entitled.", "The plan was never a bad plan; the plan was no kids allowed at the wedding and 4 entitled families brought kids who caused multiple issues at not only the ceremony, but the reception as well.\n\nIf people want to come, they have to respect the rules. If they don't want to respect the rules, they can send their best wishes and not come.\n\nOP was justified in not inviting them knowing that they would disregard the child-free rule again. I honestly think OP should've been more upfront with them about why they weren't being invited, public or not. How they acted and how they allowed the children who weren't even meant to be there to act was super disrespectful and those people need to accept that the error is entirely their fault.", "Not in this universe."]}
