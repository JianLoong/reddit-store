I started working with my dad at his business full time and I'm doing great there. Every since I started working there my moms attitude has completely changed toward me and she's just had something against me. She's always short with me, always making passive aggressive comments towards me, like I genuinely feel like she doesn't want to see me succeed sadly. \n\nShe started charging me for \"rent\" while I'm staying there, which is a couple hundred dollars a month. I just feel like I'm being taken advantage of though. Like I don't think she will or will ever wrap her head around the fact that I have my own life, and my life doesn't revolve around her.\n\nI want to stay at my dads for a day or two out of the week? I'm selfish and only think about myself because now she has to come home to take out our family dog that her and her bf decided to get.\n\nI want to go away for the weekend or go out once in a blue moon? I'm selfish because I don't consider her and her schedule/plans and I just do what I want.\n\nShe literally will tell me to make plans or go to my dads for the weekend because she wants to house to herself, even though I pay her rent she literally kicks me out. \n\nIt's more thing's like this that I'm frustrated with but these are just a few examples.\n\nBack in December 2021 thing's were really bad in our relationship, we were fighting all the time and I was really considering moving out. My aunt talked me out of it because she said if I moved in with my dad, my mom will 100% be extremely offended and our relationship will probably never be the same, regardless of if it would be better for me. \n\nI decided against it at the time, but a year later thing's still haven't changed and they probably never will. My mom is very hard-headed, has a major victim complex and is just toxic.

This is not unreasonable.\n\n\"my life doesn't revolve around her.\"\n\nHer life doesn't revolve around you, either.  You also aren't entitled to a rent-free life with your parents in perpetuity.\n\nNow onto the real issue: She kicks you out when she wants privacy and she give you shit if you go out on your own time.  She's not being reasonable, especially when you're paying rent.  A landlord can't kick out a renter like that.  Even if they are having work done on the rental house, they have to work with the renter and give advance notice.\n\n\"I'm wondering WIBTA if I moved out and went to stay with him?\"\n\nNo, NTA She's taking your working with/for your dad very personally and lashing out.

It is partly owned by you since you are renting.\n\nThe victim blaming is also infuriating and honestly, I wouldn't bother trying to mend the relationship.
