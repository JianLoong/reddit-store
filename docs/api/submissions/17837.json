My mom did this when I was a kid. It wasn't put \"away\" and was therefore trash. It didn't matter if I had just gotten up to go to the bathroom or do something she told me to do, it wasn't away, so she would throw it out. \n\nNow she constantly asks where things go or if we need them when she visits. Our house has a live-in feel. We tend to group stuff to get put away \"later\", so she keeps trying to clean up or put away those piles.

However. Geez. Unless you absolutely despise the woman take the DVD holder out of the trash and tell her it's safe to come over again. Just don't throw my shit out. She's your mom.

Your mother was certainly over-enthusiastic (and throwing away the movie case?  that's odd) but I think you were perhaps over-short with her.  A lot depends on how you told her to get out...  compare \"Ma, I'm really losing it here, please get your blankets and give me some space\" vs \"Ma, GTFO!\" \n\nUltimately this shouldn't be a relationship-damaging incident.

Your house, your rules. If she wants to clean, she has her own house.\n\nOn the sciatica topic, may I recommend some things that have helped me and others I know? Instead of heat pads, use lavender seeds heating pads. It eases the pain and the lavender makes you feel more relaxed so less contraction. Check a podologist and a sport rehab to see if wearing shoes with some heel (or heeled sole) can help. (It really depends on the shape of your back, I feel less pain in 10cm heels than in sneakers). Neurodepreasants, they help control the pain without all the side effects of painkillers and are also less addictive. Memory foam cushion for chairs, total life changer. This last one has worked on several people I know. Cannabis cream. Perfectly legal almost anywhere and is better than most pain creams. If you can find a homemade one, even better. Hope this can help a bit. We have to help each other feel the best they can.", "NTA. Especially if you have had this talk with Mama already, I mean wtf. Who throws away the cases to discs they see on the side anyway??? That is baffling in itself.", "NTA. My mom is similar in her passion for cleaning, but my mom also understands that I deserve privacy and respect. She asks before cleaning my house and checks in with me frequently (she enjoys doing this and volunteers for it. I have disabilities so it's difficult for me to keep up). You need to establish clear boundaries with your mom on this. She needs to know that she is out of line to do so without your consent.", "NTA!!!\n\nYou\u2019re working and she\u2019s vacuuming, doing dishes, and threw away something that belongs to you????\n\nDo not apologize. She way overstepped. IF you decide to allow her to use the washer and dryer again \u2014 after she apologizes \u2014 only allow it when you\u2019re not working so you can supervise her because she really stomps over boundaries.", "I bet what happened is the case was empty and he compulsive need to clean up caused her to label it as trash that must be discarded or she'll go crazy", "People like ops mom are the kind of people who would throw a way something that's \"not in its place\" even tho you did not leave it laying around you just got up to go pee and left it on the kitchen table", "Well he may have been working while she was cleaning and this couldn't leave his work \nAnd she can bring a book to read while waiting for the laundry", "It was in the wrong place it must be trash!

LOL", "We could work on that.\n\nOn further consideration, I am a bit of a hoarder and she would be doing me a favour. :) \n\nWould you be ok with her cleaning if she didn't throw anything out? I don't blame you for being upset with her for throwing your stuff out, but I hate to see someone's feelings hurt when they are trying to repay you for letting her use your washing machine.", "NTA. The first time I went on vacation after buying my house, my mom did something similar. After I returned and saw what she did, I took away my parents' key to my house.\n\n(The only reason I had given them a copy of my house key was in case of some crazy emergency where no one could reach me, and it turned out I was unconscious in my house. Needless to say, that emergency scenario has never happened.)", "I mean, I agree, but if it's season 8... I understand...", "NTA. Set firm boundaries, with consequences, and stick to them!  So like \"mom, I love you, and I appreciate you trying to help out. I need you to understand that this is my house, and if I choose to not vacuum, so be it.

That\u2019s incredibly rude behaviour.", "Exactly, my fiancee and I really bonded over the show and we like watching it again, sometimes. I like Danyres and she likes one of the Lannister boys whose name is escaping me rn.", "you can't see how passive aggressive this parent is behaving? \n\nHinting she needed somewhere to wash something that could probably wait (edit - didn't see the cat urine part. Whole story sounds cooked up to me.) \n\nOP invited her to use his machine, knowing what she's like.  \n\nThe throwing away of DVD **cover** (OP admits he didn't put it away) is clear cut passive aggressive behavior.\n\n(I've already made my ruling.)", "That's really cool", "Yes.\nI can't imagine kicking a friend out easily let alone a parent. Boundaries shouldn't be crossed but communication goes a long way.\nI don't think kicking her out solves anything.", "NTA? I'm not sure. Maybe this is not a popular opinion, but maybe slightly also YTA. What your mother did, is downright annoying. I have a mother like that. On the other hand, she was idly waiting for the washing machine to get finished and just used her time well. Agreed, it is compulsive and also somewhat disrespectful as it is sending the message 'your house is not clean enough', but I had this discussions with my mother a lot of times and genuinely she only wanted to help, since it did not bother her (though it did bother me). I told her she really had to stop this or else she would not have been welcome, I told her she made me feel worthless and made me cry (that upset her and opened her eyes). Have you ever set such clear boundaries or just had arguments over it, without making it absolutely clear it had to stop? Kicking your mother out of the house is perhaps a bit overreacting. I would have torn the vacuum cleaner out of her hands and told her to sit down with a book and leave my house alone and not throw away DVD cases and that the next time I would tell her to leave. But perhaps you already have been that severe with her and in that case NTA."]}
