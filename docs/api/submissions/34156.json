You shouldn't be in a position where you get made to feel bad for not wanting sex. Ever. Make sure she's clear on why you said no, but also know that you're allowed to say no for *any* reason.", "NTA - And why would you want to continue a relationship where you get gaslit or manipulated into feeling bad about saying \u201cno\u201d?\n\nIf the roles were reversed and you were posting as a 26 year old woman, the internet would be up in arms telling you to dump your partner. If she\u2019s that caught up in not getting sex and punishing you for it, move on. Childish behaviors like that tend not to get better, but worse over time.", "NTA she most likely never has been turned down before for any reason and her pride and ego got hurt. Your body and your choice if you didnt want sex even if it was just cause it would be awkward cause your sisters room is next door. Do not apologize", "NTA.  A guy has just as much of a right to say no as a woman does.", "What if the shoe was on the other foot and she rejected you for sex and you got mad? You would be the a hole, just think about it that way, so yeah NTA mate", "NTA. You gave her a clear reason why you didn't think it was a good idea to have sex. \n\nIt's childish for her to give you the silent treatment. Your reasoning is completely valid; after all, nobody (I hope) wants to hear their sibling bang a room over.", "NTA she's being childish", "Childish games. Don't play them.", "NTA. No one is ever the asshole for saying no to sex when they are uncomfortable. EVER.", "NTA. Sometimes it isn't appropriate.", "NTA. You never should be apologetic for turning down sex, if you otherwise behave well. If it's a problem for her, she should really start thinking about growing up.", "NTA. Part of the toxic masculinity is to expect men are always ready to have sex. You don't have to question whether it's an AH behauvior to say no.", "NTA - you were being considerate and she was not", "NTA, OP your gf sucks. This behaviour isn\u2019t okay. Ever.", "Nta not having sex for one night is the end of the world", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s the next morning and she is still giving you the silent treatment? That is not a healthy reaction. Hell even her reaction in the moment of pushing your hand away is childish. If my partner or I initiate and the other says no, ok no big deal.", "Hard NTA, anyone can say no for any reason and is never the AH. If your gf is mad that's for her to work through.", "Slightly the asshole but not for not wanting sex. You have not communicated your reasons as to why you didn't want to have sex and she is feeling rejected with no reason or understanding why you rejected her advances or signals. I would apologise to her and say the reason why you rejected her advances but you weren't meaning to hurt her feelings you were just aware of how close your family were and were worried they would hear you. Make her feel wanted.", "Info: You\u2019re never an asshole for not wanting sex but there\u2019s also some communication needed. Did you tell her why? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong..  obviously you don\u2019t NEED a reason and just not feeling like it is also enough. but the other side is she might feel rejected and insecure. And she has the right to have feelings about that too. \n\nDid you have a talk about it?\n\nEdited to add: yes she\u2019s an asshole for giving you the silent treatment. That\u2019s manipulative. But there\u2019s still a possibility she feels rejected and insecure. Communication is always key.", "You should have been texting her to meet you in the restroom while her parents were there at breakfast for a quickie.

Have a conversation about boundaries and expectations for the betterment of your relationship and if she doesnt listen or even try to listen then u have to make a choice.", "NTA - your partner is being extremely immature. if the roles were reversed she'd let you absolutely have it for reacting like this. being in a relationship doesn't entail having to put out at every request. i would have a serious talk with her about this reaction because even if the reason is that she felt embarrassed or unattractive by you turning down her advances, that's signaling some other deep-rooted insecurity issues that are bound to make a reappearance and affect your relationship down the road. if that's not what the issue is then you may want to get out because if she's going to react like this every time she hears the word \"no\".... it's not worth seeing the relationship thru tbh. she needs to either get a grip or address whatever insecurity issues she has going on", "NTA. You don't always have to feel like sex when your partner does.", "NTA. There is a time and place for sex, and at your family's home with family members around wasn't one of them. It is okay to say no to sex but do explain why and if she's not understanding or reacting negatively over it, then do have second think about your relationship with her. Like do you want a partner who you can communicate to overcome problems, or do you want a partner who plays games and places the problems onto you?", "Nope your all in the good. Sounds like she\u2019s just with you for the d*ck", "Did you explain to her why you turned her down? If you did and she still got annoyed it's a very immature response..", "Thank you, everyone seems to agree with this opinion so I can feel less bad about it", "Exactly. She's a grown ass woman. OP has every right to deny her. Sometimes people don't want sex.\n\nOP tell her the reason and if she didn't try to understand, it's time for some boundaries in your relationship.", "Or for no reason.", "Do you really think so? You don\u2019t think this could be a one off?", "This. And any reason for not wanting sex is sufficient reason. \n\nIt's never a good feeling to be rejected, but silent treatment the day after is a huge overreaction.", "Why is he the asshole?", "Speaking as a woman, if I\u2019m irritated about not getting sex, it\u2019s only in that moment and it\u2019s more of a momentary hurt feeling at being rejected and feeling unwanted. What she\u2019s doing is outright manipulative. You don\u2019t hold a grudge because something didn\u2019t go your way well into the next day.\n\nIf someone shows you their true colors, believe it."]}
