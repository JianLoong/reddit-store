Not only would it be unhealthy, potentially dangerous, for your daughter to compete based on the symptoms you\u2019ve described, if I were one of the other parents and learned that someone had allowed their sick kid to come and potentially infect my kid, I\u2019d be furious. \n\nMy daughters used to do competitive dance and I saw this kind of thing all the time (but from other parents, astonishingly).

Illness is a non-negotiable area. They may not be able to compete, but she's not well. They're just gonna have to deal.", "NTA. She\u2019s seven, it literally doesn\u2019t matter for her future. Why does the coach want you to subject your sick child to potentially even more disease by bringing her to the hospital, let alone poking her with needles and stuff.", "NTA. She's 7. It is not the olympics. And even if it were, she shouldn't be forced to compete when ill.", "I'm guessing you're not comfortable being assertive, or the coach is particularly aggressive, because NTA is the obvious answer here. Simply remind yourself, and the coach, that sometimes life isn't fair and it's a disappointment that she won't be there, but she won't, end of story, end of phone call/text thread.

One thing I don't see mentioned yet is that if you took your daughter to the hospital to \"get fluids\" and told them, \"Oh, we're just patching her up so she can compete in her cheer tournament,\" it wouldn't be far-fetched to expect a visit from CPS. Sure, medical staff are overworked and underpaid, but some of them still give a shit.
