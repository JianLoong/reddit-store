Let your daughter rest up and if the coach gets mad then maybe it\u2019s time to find a new gym", "Jesus Christ, this is insane. NTA. Not only would it be unhealthy, potentially dangerous, for your daughter to compete based on the symptoms you\u2019ve described, if I were one of the other parents and learned that someone had allowed their sick kid to come and potentially infect my kid, I\u2019d be furious. \n\nMy daughters used to do competitive dance and I saw this kind of thing all the time (but from other parents, astonishingly). Once a mom made her 9yo compete with strep throat. I kept my girls home when they were sick. \n\nJust insane.", "NTA.  She's sick, probably contagious. Her well-being is top priority.  Her not getting others sick is next priority.", "Nta. Your child is sick, idk if she's a flyer or just a regular tumbler. Anyway if she's coughing during a fly or tumble and throws off her balance she could get seriously injured. \n\nThe coach should have standbys ready to take the place of other children that are Ill as this is flu season.", "  NTA they are children! Not professional athletes. BTW cheer has the greatest amount of sport injuries \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA \n\nYour daughter needs to rest. \n\nShe also needs to stay home, just in case she is contagious.", "NTA. Illness is a non-negotiable area. They may not be able to compete, but she's not well. They're just gonna have to deal.", "NTA. She\u2019s seven, it literally doesn\u2019t matter for her future. Why does the coach want you to subject your sick child to potentially even more disease by bringing her to the hospital, let alone poking her with needles and stuff.", "NTA. She's 7. It is not the olympics. And even if it were, she shouldn't be forced to compete when ill.", "I'm guessing you're not comfortable being assertive, or the coach is particularly aggressive, because NTA is the obvious answer here. Simply remind yourself, and the coach, that sometimes life isn't fair and it's a disappointment that she won't be there, but she won't, end of story, end of phone call/text thread. Do kids get sick before competitions, or do cars break down on the way to competitions, or do unexpected funerals occur on the day of competitions? Yes.

They want you to take a 7y/o to go get IV fluids? The fuck?! They clearly cannot be trusted to prioritize the safety and well being of the children under their tutelage.

The health of your daughter, the rest of her team, and anyone she could come in contact with is so much more important than any competition. especially at age 7. JFC, what is wrong with people? Either modify the routine, substitute a kid, or pull out of the competition.", "NTA. Even if your daughter was 17 rather than 7 there is no excuse to send her to perform an incredibly physically exerting routine in close proximity to many other people.

WTF?\n\nHonestly that is WAY out of line!  I\u2019d screenshot all texts and send them to the organization - that coach is insane.

Then again, it would have served them right if she HAD gone and ended up doing the Technicolor Yawn \ud83e\udd2eduring the competition.", "NTA i thought this was ridiculous when I thought your daughter was 16 but then you said she was 7!!! 7!!!! No no no. That coach has issues.", "So this coach is obviously insane. One thing I don't see mentioned yet is that if you took your daughter to the hospital to \"get fluids\" and told them, \"Oh, we're just patching her up so she can compete in her cheer tournament,\" it wouldn't be far-fetched to expect a visit from CPS. Sure, medical staff are overworked and underpaid, but some of them still give a shit.

Wtf. 4 years into a pandemic and this is what they want to do when your child is clearly too sick to compete?", "NTA with a 102 fever you need to prioritize her health. She isn\u2019t even in high school yet. I would be having a conversation with the gym owner and asking if this is how all coaches at her gym are. She is 7.

When someone was ill or hurt last minute it sucks but they either changed the stunt groups or had someone from another squad stand in.

The notion that you should get her fluids at the hospital and bring her is tantamount to child abuse.\n\nIf there are cheer teams with more rational coaches, I would suggest that you look into them.  Yes, it's important that you support your team and participate every time.  But it's even more important that ill or injured children not participate.

Holy crap. Keep her in bed, give her a nice soup.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s the coaches fault for not have alternates just in case. Like with a play  there is always an understudy. If they can\u2019t compete because one child is sick then it\u2019s on them not on you because they didn\u2019t prepare for something like this.
