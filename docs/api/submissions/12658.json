It sounds like you DID know that you were supposed to watch your mother's dogs that week.  You agreed to it on the phone, but asked that she put the dates in writing in an email.  She did not, so you punitively decided to be unavailable and leave her in the lurch.\n\nThat would typically be a bit controlling and petty.  Like it is fine to make reasonable requests, and to ask that people send you details in writing.  But sometimes people forget, and \"teaching them a lesson\" over something that you really did remember, without the email... well, it's not exactly *nice*.\n\nBUT they lost a lot of credibility with the beginning of the story.  Making an airport pickup request MONTHS in advance, never following up, and then actually acting like you owe someone an Uber payment is insane.  If they are going to try to CHARGE you for not remember their verbal requests, then you can punish them for not remembering your requests for texts.\n\nSeriously, I can't get over them wanting you to pay for his ride...\n\n*where they expect me to change my plans last minute because they forgot to tell me everything I needed to know.*\n\nAnd that is a HELL NO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019ve set boundaries and are sticking to them.  You also have a life beyond them.  The only person that seems to have gotten the message is your father.", "NTA. You are very clear of your expectations. They can either provide the info requested or get someone else. You are not refusing them just forcing them to act like adults. Good for you.", "Very, very obviously NTA. Sounds like your mom is a HUGE user and thinks you\u2019re her slave and your life should revolve around HER. Your dad must be a saint. Yikes.", "NTA.\n\nCheers for you! \n\nAsking you to do something with a vague time-frame or missing details, and expecting you to be available regardless is a way of control. And claiming they told you when they didn't is gaslighting. Stick to your method - it works fine!", "You are amazing for providing this life hack", "NTA.  This just seems like good sense.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re planning your schedule with the information you have - expecting you to ways have an open schedule or to drop plans for non-emergencies is an asshole move.\n\nIf they forget to send you the information, that\u2019s on them.\n\nYou\u2019re not being difficult - you\u2019re not being a pushover. Your agreement was always contigent on getting the information about when etc.\n\n> and that if I agree to do something I need to follow through.\n\nYou agreed if she sent the info; she didn\u2019t. So when you were suprised on the day of, you had made plans and were unavailable. That could have been avoided if your MOM had followed through on her word.", "NTA Hurrah! You are an inspiration!", "You're awesome. Your family isn't. Since the shit hit their fan (BIL airport pick up and mom/dog situation), maybe they'll change.\n\nIf I had a family member who was willing to make airport runs and housesit my dogs, I'd treat you like the precious gift that you are.

Bless your heart. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0a\n\nNTA.", "NTA you are asking for basic info to help if that can't help themselves, why should you?", "NTA. \n\nThe double standard of your mom saying that sending you extra information about her trip 'slipped her mind' yet being angry at you for not being there at an unconfirmed time is hilarious.", "NTA.\n\n> if I agree to do something I need to follow through.\n\nCorrection. If they ask you for a favor, *they need to follow through* with details in an email or text to confirm the what/when of the favor and that you\u2019ve agreed.\n\nThey just see your time as disposable for their whims. Like you\u2019re simply standing around waiting for the opportunity to do something for them and make yourself useful.", "NTA This is how it should be done. My family does it automatically for 'big asks' that will take days to see through, and for things scheduled long beforehand. Short-term quasi-emergencies usually aren't done like this, but we also understand that someone might not be free and we don't get upset when they aren't.", "NTA You made your terms clear. You needed critical information that you were denied and so didn\u2019t act because you were never informed of where/when/how etc.", "Just say no to favours and it's easy. My time is valuable and if they are disrespecting that, they  are disrespecting my money. I have no time for bums even if they are family.", "NTA", "Oh, hell no - NTA. You don't ask ANYONE to do something months in advance and expect it to still happen without speaking to them about it at least a week before the event. Seriously? Who remembers shit like that? But to double down and ream you out because you didn't follow through?? Nope!", "NTA.  Asking if you can pick up someone from the airport without the date, time and flight number makes no sense.  Asking someone to watch pets without specifying when you're leaving and returning makes not sense.  Sounds like you're willing to be helpful, but to be helpful you need the full data - you can't bring someone to an appointment without knowing the date and time.\nSadly, I think you're family is in the minority by not telling you the date and time to pick up someone from the airport.  Most people will say \"Can you pick me up from the airport and Sunday March 19 at 4:00.  I'll be on flight 123.\"  Can't do the pickup without knowing that information.  \nStand your ground here, you mom and sister can be mad all day, but you had no idea she wanted you to be available on a specific day since she didn't tell you the specified date!", "op=NTA\n\nYou have simple guidelines.  \nBUT suggestion Don't AGREE to anything until you have all the information.\n\nIe  \nMom:  Can you watch my dogs?  \nOP:  I'll need the dates, time etc to determine if i'm available at that time.  \nMom:  I need to know now.  \nOP:  So do I or I cannot assess my availability.", "NTA, I can relate to this. I'm the oldest of my siblings and it's become a trend to just dump everything on me. I assume that this goes beyond just being am inconvenience for OP. There's probably been many situations in the past where OP had to cancel their own plans to accommodate to their family and they probably never cared to show gratitude.", "This problem can be solved in under 5 minutes by making couple of phone calls after details are finalised.", "NTA.\n\nLiterally every single time me or my mum ask the other to do something we will say \"text me\" because we know we'll forget about it otherwise.\n\nNo text, can't be upset if the other person forgets. \n\nIt's a great system idk why they're so opposed to it.\n\nAlso love that your mom said it has \"slipped her mind\" to text you, but expects you to remember to something she mentioned so long ago. I don't even remember what I ate last night.", "Nta but do not agree to do anything with the caveat of receiving the details later. Instead, they can send all of the details up front along with the request and then you can accept or decline doing them a favor.", "NTA, all jokes aside you\u2019re hilarious! A hilarious genius at that, I should start implementing this into my family dynamic!", "NTA, but I\u2019ll make a suggestion. Never agree without the information you need. You could have told your mom, text me the dates and I\u2019ll let you know. It\u2019s her fault for stopping listening after the yes, but it would be easier on all of you if you never agree at all without having the information you need. Enforce this boundary and they will get the hang of it.", "NTA:  you\u2019re NOT unwilling to help. You\u2019re just unwilling to be used as door mat. You can\u2019t literally provide gaurantees to help if you don\u2019t even know simple details like date and time. I understand things come up last minute but this isn\u2019t what we are talking about. It\u2019s simple respectful behavior. I don\u2019t even know why they wouldn\u2019t want to confirm with you just to give them peace of mind. I guess they\u2019ve taken your help for granted for so long they have become a bit spoiled. .", "NTA. Banff is awesome hope you had a great time!", "NTA\n\nI love this for you. You\u2019re not letting people run you over and use you, the fact that they\u2019re family doesn\u2019t make a difference. Some families will take advantage of how help one person is and just keep using the phrase \u201cyou agreed to it\u201d.", "NTA. I never had any real troubles with my parents about this, just a few missed events due to, \u201cI said something a while ago.\u201d  \n\nThe answer was simple. My mom added me to her calendar events. Whenever she schedules a doctor\u2019s appointment or anything really, I get an invite. 90% of them I can ignore, but she always makes sure to ask if she needs me for any of them, and I do the same.", "NTA you are asking for the basic information to make the arrangements to help them.   That's the bare minimum expectation when making any arrangements. The fact your asking for it in writing just shows how often they don't provide you with the minimal organisational requirements", "NTA\n\nYou set a very minimal expectation.  That they communicate.  Your mother can\u2019t be bothered.  Her own fault.", "NTA, When your mother agrees to send you the specified dates a month in advance, she needs to follow through. Your father sounds like he's genuinely trying to respect your boundaries and even gets confirmation before his surgery. You are not a slave, maid or tool to be used at their convenience. You are an adult whose time should be respected just like anybody else.", "NTA. If you're doing a favor, it's on the other person to follow through, not you.", "NTA", "Nope NTA and it's genius in my opinion. They want something from a business they'd have to do the same, asking you to act as an Uber or pet sitter is of the same level in my opinion. If they can't confirm in advance and in writing when they would like your help then they can go to someone else or actually pay a service.", "Nta", "NTA Holy r/justnofamily", "NTA This is awesome.  I used to have the same thing happen to me.", "NTA, and if this leads to a huffy \"Fiiiiiine, I'll never ask you to do anything for me again!\" then...cool!", "NTA. I love that you've done this for yourself!", "NTA\n\nThis is painful to read, as my family is as entitled as yours and attempts to demand (unsuccessfully) I be at their beck and call also.\n\nEven though I don\u2019t even make enough money to move out into a safe apartment in the area (HCOL) and they make $17,000 a MONTH in RETIREMENT.\n\nThe entitlement is so real and I am so sick of it. It needs to die and you need to help it die by pushing back as hard as you are (or harder).\n\nMaybe even just tell your (uncooperative) family you will not be doing anything for them at all. Ever. See how they deal.", "yes yes yes!!", "This. But, OP, change your response. \"I think that COULD work for me, pending more information. This is not a confirmation I'll do it until I get all the information.\"", "The way I read this they gave him the date and time and what they needed of him. He agreed but asked for details in writing. The confirmation didn't arrive. But he had already agreed.\n\nI'm a little torn if I read this correctly. Because I see someone who agreed to do it but had something he'd rather do come up and found an excuse to skip out. That makes him T A. \n\nIt also feels like the whole thing is kind of awkward, this is what I do with coworkers to cover my ass in case they later try to change their mind. When my boss comes to gripe at me I show them the emails, \"no. That's not what happened, here are the receipts.\" It's hard for me to imagine treating my family like that. I don't even get along well with my mom.and sister but I'm still willing not to be tedious like this. When they ask me for something I just put it on my calendar. A week or so out one or the other of us usually confirms the plan. \"Hey, mom. I agreed to pick you up from the airport but what's your flight number?\" \n\nBut maybe this is the result of years of family members not treating his time with respect and he's just done with it. I could see that.", "and most people will follow up with \"What dates will you be away?\" and not give an answer until that is known.", "\"I need you to watch my dogs at the end of the month\" is a vague statement. If you say, I should be able to do that just let me know when it is, and they never bothered to tell you when it is. . . \n\nThat's on them.  \n\nIf they don't actually give you a date and time, by the time they ask, they're not asking a month in advance. They're asking an hour in advance.  If my sister wants me to babysit her kids at the end of the month, I'm not going to open up an entire 2-week time span just so that I'm available.  If she doesn't tell me, and then comes the 31st, she tells me 30 minutes ahead of time that she needs to drop off the kids, that's her fault, not mine.", "Who is OP supposed to put anything in a calender without knowing the date?", "In terms of tone I got more kf the \"I'm tired of this argument\" tone rather than a reluctance to help tone.", "Yeah that's what's really annoying. In some parts OP comes across as someone who doesn't want to do these favours anyway, kinda like \"My way or the highway\" type deal.\n\nIt's great that this system works for their dad and some other people, but it's not gonna work for everyone and OP should change their language when they're accepting favours for other people.

You need to ask \"When?\" since you family seems to have a problem establishing the time and/or date.  Asking for \"information/details\" from them doesn't seem to register that you are asking for a date and time.  I don't get your mom, asking you to watch her dogs without saying when is bizarre, the dates she'll be away should be part of the question.  Doesn't everyone say \"Can you watch my dogs while I'm on vacation from May 1 to May 9\"?", "Sister's mad because SHE was the one inconvenienced.

I will NOT remember if someone sent me a quick text with no info or if they just told me verbally if I don't put it in my calendar.\n\nIt's also a dick move on mom's side not to mention a date and time, and when asked to do so, not responding.\n\nSo for the most part NTA but there is some ESH.", "Do like OP's brother in law and order a taxi like a self sufficient human being...", "Yeah my mom forwards the email confirmation for her flights. It\u2019s not hard. My email even recognizes it as an event and asks to add it to my calendar!", "It matters because if OP's telling someone yes and just forgetting to put it on their calendar, then they're an asshole. Don't say yes to something you aren't going to do.\n\nThis solution from OP is a good workaround regardless of what OP was doing previously, but they should still just say no to anything that isn't a written request."]}
