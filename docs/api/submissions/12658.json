It sounds like you DID know that you were supposed to watch your mother's dogs that week.  You agreed to it on the phone, but asked that she put the dates in writing in an email.  She did not, so you punitively decided to be unavailable and leave her in the lurch.\n\nThat would typically be a bit controlling and petty.  Like it is fine to make reasonable requests, and to ask that people send you details in writing.  But sometimes people forget, and \"teaching them a lesson\" over something that you really did remember, without the email... well, it's not exactly *nice*.\n\nBUT they lost a lot of credibility with the beginning of the story.  Making an airport pickup request MONTHS in advance, never following up, and then actually acting like you owe someone an Uber payment is insane.  If they are going to try to CHARGE you for not remember their verbal requests, then you can punish them for not remembering your requests for texts.\n\nSeriously, I can't get over them wanting you to pay for his ride...\n\n*where they expect me to change my plans last minute because they forgot to tell me everything I needed to know.*\n\nAnd that is a HELL NO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
