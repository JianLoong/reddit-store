That was the last straw. My mom and dad gave me shit and tried to make me pay for his Uber. \n\nSo I sent my entire family and email followed up by a text.

Easy peasy. \n\nThe rest of them have been a pain in the ass. My mom asked me if I could watch her and my stepdad's dogs while they were out of town.

She said I was being an asshole and that it had slipped her mind. I told her I would be back on Monday night and that she could kennel them or leave them with my sister until then. She said not to bother. She ended up just leaving them with my sister. \n\nMy sister is pissed at me so I forwarded her a screenshot of the text where I agreed to watch the dogs as long as I got the requested information.

It sounds like you DID know that you were supposed to watch your mother's dogs that week.  You agreed to it on the phone, but asked that she put the dates in writing in an email.  She did not, so you punitively decided to be unavailable and leave her in the lurch.\n\nThat would typically be a bit controlling and petty.  Like it is fine to make reasonable requests, and to ask that people send you details in writing.  But sometimes people forget, and \"teaching them a lesson\" over something that you really did remember, without the email... well, it's not exactly *nice*.\n\nBUT they lost a lot of credibility with the beginning of the story.  Making an airport pickup request MONTHS in advance, never following up, and then actually acting like you owe someone an Uber payment is insane.  If they are going to try to CHARGE you for not remember their verbal requests, then you can punish them for not remembering your requests for texts.\n\nSeriously, I can't get over them wanting you to pay for his ride...\n\n*where they expect me to change my plans last minute because they forgot to tell me everything I needed to know.*\n\nAnd that is a HELL NO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
