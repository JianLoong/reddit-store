When I was young our father lived with us but was rarely home and as I learned later had affairs with other women. He eventually left when my mom was pregnant with my sister and she was a single mother from then on. She never fought him for child support which I never understood and had a downward spiral with meth. She left me and my sister with our grandma who didn\u2019t want anything to do with us but took us in because we had no one else and I mostly raised my sister. I got her dressed in the morning, cleaned the house, cooked and picked her up from school etc. I actually drove on a learners licence to get her to and from school as walking was over 30 min and worked throughout high school since money was always tight. Our grandma wanted us out when I was 22 and so I got an apartment with friends and my sister stayed with me until 19 which she then moved out. \n\nShe is really troubled and has a lot of behavior issues. She acted out a lot when she was younger mostly towards me because my grandma would just leave her in the yard to \u201ccalm down\u201d.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her fault because our parents didn\u2019t want us and our grandma tolerated us but didn\u2019t want us around. But I was sick of raising her and was so relieved after she left. I felt like I had no choice but to raise her but I wanted to live my own life. I probably will never have kids because raising her was all the parenting I want to do for the rest of my life. \n\nMy bf and I moved in together last year and it\u2019s been going well. I\u2019m finally living a decent life until my sister called to tell me she was pregnant. I was flipping out because she asked to stay with me and I live in a 2 bedroom apartment, one room of which my bf uses as an office. \n\nI told her if she needs me to drive her to another state I will do it but living with us and helping her raise the baby wasn\u2019t something I was going to do. She started crying and begging me to help her since she doesn\u2019t know who the father is (she suspects 2 guys) but she wants to keep the child. I told her then she needs to raise the child herself and I wasn\u2019t getting involved. She\u2019s called me multiple times and I feel guilty but I don\u2019t want her to come in and ruin a life I\u2019m actually happy to have.", "created_utc": 1692217325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t0vw3/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_sister_im_not/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This exact situation is probably why your grandma was so cold, break the generational curse", "NTA. NTA. if she moves in with you she probably will never leave. Could Legally be a nightmare depending on where you live when the day comes you want her out. \n\nYou already offered to help in one way.", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to feel that way. Just like if she wants to raise the child then she needs to step up to the plate, put her big girl panties on and grow the fuck up. If she can't then she needs to either find a state that will allow her to have an abortion or give the baby up for adoption.

That is a very Complicated Spot to be in. I do not know what the \"correct\" course of Action is, i just think you have every right to be fed up. \n\nI think your sister should consider terminating the pregnancy if possible or think about Adoption.
