My point is don't run from having kids because of this exp with your sister.", "NTA \n\nIf she wants to keep the baby, that comes with massive responsibilities, if she isn\u2019t up for those responsibilities then she isn\u2019t ready to be a parent.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nShe's in a rough situation, but it's a situation of her own making (and whatever dude it was) \n\nYou stepped up for her all through her childhood in a way that very few people would (or should). You've already done so much more for her than anyone could reasonably expect. Now it's time for you to actually take a breather and take care of yourself. It's her time to step up and do better for herself.", "Nta.  She needs to put the baby up for adoption.  Best thing.", "Really did not need the extremely long backstory, but NTA. Talk to your sister into going to another state if possible. She is the last person that needs to be having a kid.", "HUGE NTA. She has no business attempting to force you to be some kind of \u201cgrandma\u201d!", "NTA.\n\nDon't let her guilt you into capitulating. Your sister can't see this from your perspective. For her, you were her one constant in a very chaotic upbringing, and perhaps that's led her to expect you to bail her out whenever she wants you to. But that's not your responsibility.\n\nIt wasn't your responsibility to raise her, either, but you stepped up because all the adults failed you. While admirable, this does not set a pattern you must follow forever.\n\nYour sister is now an adult. She has got pregnant and if she insists on keeping the baby, it's up to her to figure out how she will get by. While it feels cold and cruel, in reality your are simply protecting yourself. You deserve to live your own life after all the sacrifices you made as a child (that your sister can't see). \n\nBesides, you don't want to be stuck raising your niece/nephew if your sister decides she's done being a mother at some point.", "You already had to be her mother previously, it's totally unfair to ask you to be grandma at this *very young* stage in your life. NTA", "NTA. Your sister and her child is not your responsibility. I hope she can get help and support from the state.", "NTA my sister constantly pushes her child onto me. I get it, I don't want children nor do I want to raise someone else's. You're saving yourself someone else's responsibility. I get helping new parents out but when people don't pull their own weight for their own kids it sucks. Good on you for standing up for yourself and not going through a second motherhood.", "Wow, that's so sad on so many levels. I am so sorry you were in that situation for so long.\n\nWhatever you decide, NTA.\n\nWhat you may do to help, is work with her to get her signed up for everything she is eligible for and work with her to find out who the father is so she can get child support. How much you want to help is your choice as well.", "NTA: It\u2019s her choice to keep the baby but it\u2019s definitely not your responsibility to help raise the baby.\n\n\nI helped my eldest sister\u2019s and brother with their kids eventually enough is enough I was forced to help at the time because of my Mum volunteered me. \nOnce I moved out with my Dad I refused oh you need help when you have kids, and I said at the time no I actually raise my kids and not dump them on someone else every weekend. \n\nAnd I stood by it I have my own kids and never had any of my siblings watch them the only time babysat was my Dad I asked him I advance because I was going to hospital and my husband couldn\u2019t have the day off.", "This would be an unbelievably big commitment. \n\nNo father on on the scene to help either, even with child support \n\nNTA", "I doubt you've the resolve to leave your sister to her own devices. I think you'll help her out of pity. But whatever the case letting her moving in with you doesn't seem like a good idea.", "NTA. Tell her that you'll help her put the kid up for adoption if she changes her mind, but that's it.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister needs to grow the hell up and either start being an adult, or she's not ready to parent. Plain, simple, and she doesn't need anything from you to make that decision.", "NTA.\n\nYou'll be caring for _two_ children if you take her in.", "You are doing the right thing even if its hard. She is going to rise to the occasion or it will unfortunately be a bad situation. You can support her non-financially from afar in what ever way you feel best but never let her come to your home for any reason what so ever and if she shows up unannounced, do not let her in. Make sure you BF knows this too because otherwise you will never get rid of her.  \n\nYou have worked hard to earn and get the life you want and deserve. You don't owe her or anyone else anything.", "NTA\n\n If she thinks she is \n\n>but she wants to keep the child.\n\n Then she should be mature enough to look after the child. \n\n>but I don\u2019t want her to come in and ruin a life I\u2019m actually happy to have.\n\nDon't let her. She will ruin your relationship, your life, she'll expect you to support her and her kid.", "NTA.  You have done so much more than you should have had to for her.  She is making a choice to keep the child, then she needs to get her life figured out and get on financial assistance, child assistance and medical care.", "NTA. As sad as this is, she's not a child. You both had to grow up way too fast. You offered her a way forward... she doesn't want it. As someone who also pretty much raised their siblings I can relate, but it's okay to say, \"These are my boundaries. I feel bad for what you are going through but these are the choices you are making.\"\n\nI guess you might be able to look up the information to one of those pro-birth places that say they help mothers until the baby is born. Problem is I'm not sure they care what happens after it actually makes its appearance into the world and really needs help.", "NTA", "My SIL pulled that trick with 3 kids. They were *all* still living there with kids, 14 years, ago. That shit never ends! Grands, Great-grands...nope, thanks! \n\nWanna raise kids for 65 years?\n\nOP is NTA. Sister has options and choices. None of which should involve other people (OP) raising her kid! \n\nPeople tried to lay that crap on me! I moved 150 miles away. Stayed on the road for 6 months, as well. \n\nI raised one. Mostly by myself. She had graduated college when husband's family started in on me.", "My niece got pregnant at 18, I flat out told her, \"Your life as you know it, is over. I tried to make sure you didn't get pregnant. You couldn't bother to listen. I will *never* babysit, or raise your kid. If you had any sense, you'd get an abortion and go to school!\" Girl had an e-ticket and blew it off! Stuck the kid with SD and his new wife for 5 years. Lost custody. Regained custody. \n\nNone of that was my problem. Sucks trying to deal with the Real World when you're a spoiled brat", "If the sister cannot care for a baby on her own, she needs to get an abortion, not mooch off her parentified sister who is only just starting to truly live her life.", "So op shoukd ruin her life?? Hell no", "NTA", "NTA - She wanted to play **3 Men & A Baby** \\- this is what it looks like.", "There are agencies and Charities that will help her. There are also still homes for unwed mothers, meaning young women who lost their housing due to pregnancy. She can get court ordered paternity tests or give the child up for adoption but this isn't your issue \n\nNTA", "NTA. And I'm genuinely, sincerely not saying this meanspiritedly, but you should probably talk to her about an abortion if you haven't already. She can't even have her affairs in order (no pun intended) enough to know which man impregnated her and she wants to raise a whole human being? That does not compute.", "NTA. And it might be a good idea to call her and strongly encourage that she terminate the pregnancy or consider adoption. I feel sorry for that poor kid and if you couldn\u2019t influence a different outcome that would be fantastic.", "nta", "NTA don't feel guilty and stand firm in your decision. Not your baby, not your responsibility.", "Something tells me that if you help her this time it wont be the last time she will drop a kid with unknown father on your doorstep\u2026 run. NTA", "My sister is hopeless at managing finances and becomes easily overwhelmed. I went traveling on the other side of the world and the amount of peace I experienced being in a completely different timezone and not having her call me to ask for a lift, for money, to vent about her problems etc was incredible. I loved it so much I moved permanently. It's ok to set boundaries. Nta.", "NTA. It\u2019s though on both end. \n\nYou\u2019ve helped her whilst also being a child yourself and you were forced to parent. That was unfair to you, and I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s fully understandable that now older, safe and settle you want to finally live for yourself and be selfish. No one can blame you to enjoy a slice of happiness and to want to protect what you build. Actually kudos for turning a difficult upbringing around, the odds were slim but you are doing well. \n\nYour sister want a child, being herself still a child and probably still immature. If she reached out, it means you are a safe person to her and a voice of reason. You are also the only family member she has, so a sit down could make her rethink her plans. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say to push her and cast her away but it\u2019s important for you to establish boundaries. She can\u2019t stay with you and you partner but maybe you can help with pocket money or find her a 1bed studio to start. \n\nThere\u2019s many other way to help and be present for her: for exemple filing for government assistance and so on.", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t know who the father is, doesn\u2019t have a place to live, and is clearly not ready to be a parent but wants to keep the baby anyway.  Situation is totally avoidable.", "NTA.\n\nToday she's wanting to stay because she's pregnant. Next she'll want financial support for the baby. Then she'll want support if she goes out to date and leaves the kid at your place. It's a nightmare of a rabbit hole, don't get into it. I have seen this firsthand in my family, my mother and father looked out for my mom's brother, because he was broke. Despite helping, like getting him  married, contributing financially to his kid's education, illness in the family, they still call us names.\n\nI'll share something my therapist said, \"until and unless someone is bedridden from any illness, or is born disabled, never help someone chronically. It's a disgrace to yourself, and you are breaking the spine of the person you are helping\".", "NTA, someone else's bad decisions should not necessitate a major life change for you. The best thing for that baby would be for her to give it up for adoption. She clearly can't make decent choices and life decisions.", "It's not rough at all. She was irresponsible enough to get pregnant in the first place, and now she wants to *keep it*? What the hell?", "Problem is I'm not sure they care what happens after it actually makes its appearance into the world and really needs help.", "Well, no. OP quite rightly doesn't want to help so she actually has nothing and no one.", "  She can get court ordered paternity tests or give the child up for adoption but this isn't his issue"]}
