Being a young kid at college youre gonna wanf to party. She by exploiting the other srudents morality, sje effectively double dips, and keeps the money her parents paid for, shes not repaying her parents back thst money remember. So that 75 bucks was gonna be used at the bar by OP and Jane said Naww you got other money I need this. And she got all petty", "Yea exactly. Plus it\u2019s her families money and they\u2019re ok giving it to her, she has access, but it\u2019s still not her money to donate to ungrateful people", "Of course, everyone is the hero in their own story. I'm sure there is likely a missing conversation or two (keep in mind there is a character limit).\n\nOP says her parents give her a stipend/allowance and don't want her to work during college. That's established. My mom felt the same in my first year of  school. \n\nBut OP was never under any obligation to provide Jane with food from the group order or to invite Jane to the dinner with her parents. OP was never under any obligation to do anything at all for Jane. A point you keep glossing over in your responses.\n\nI can't imagine expecting someone I've known a short time to pay for anything for me without reimbursing them. That's all we're talking about here. Jane got in on the group order and didn't reimburse OP.\n\nOP said in the post that she decided to distance herself from Jane. That, I don't think any of us can or should question. We all chose to distance ourselves from people that we've formerly dealt  with for a lot of reasons. Hell, I just removed myself from what I thought was a friendship of ten (10) years. Doesn't make me or her wrong or petty. That person and I just look at things very differently. As such, we've all gotten left out of something a 'friend' has held before, petty reasons or not. OP stated that she chose to let it go, ultimately because she felt used by Jane. \n\nAnd instead of Jane respecting OP's distance (and let's face it, if someone you were friends with chose to exclude you, you'd get an inkling that you weren't a friend to them any longer) she wanted to double down and act entitled as if OP had to include her. Jane was wrong for that, period.\n\nAs far as the money goes, OP could have gotten tens of thousands of dollars from her parents and she could have spent each dollar on drugs and drunken orgies, that's ultimately her business. Whether her parents are funding her to piss off and party at school is also not the issue at hand.\n\nYour responses seem to hinge on the idea that OP should be willing to fund Jane just because they were 'friends'. Friendship works both ways and it doesn't seem as if OP felt like Jane was being a friend to her."]}
