Not one of the FAANG companies but they still provide some really cool stuff for their employees. Our cafeteria is free and open 24 hours a day. We can eat all our meals there if we want. They have a nutritionist that makes sure the meals are tasty and healthy. \n\nI take advantage of the food on a fairly regular basis but I still keep food at my apartment to make myself meals I learned to make from my dad. And I keep Froot Loops which the cafeteria does not stock. \n\nFive weeks ago Madison left her husband and asked if she could stay with me while she figured stuff out.  I agreed since I have a spare room and we are friends. \n\nI thought it was a more temporary thing. She has a job and I think she has access to a joint account with her husband. I thought she would be here for a couple of weeks then go to her folks or settle her problems with her husband. Instead she has been in my house other than to work. \n\nShe ate all my food in the fridge and pantry. I went grocery shopping once so far but she ate everything again and didn't offer to pay to replace it. \n\nI asked her when she was going to be moving on but she says she doesn't know. I asked her for some money for groceries and she said she hasn't been paid. It's been five weeks. I don't think anyone holds back wages that long.  \n\nSo last week instead of going to Whole Foods I just started eating all my meals either at work or at a restaurant on the way home. \n\nShe asked me when I was going shopping but I said I was too busy with work. She offered to go shopping for \"us\" if I gave her the money. I said I was too busy to cook food at home. \n\nShe is saying that I'm an asshole for trying to use food to control her or too cheap to help her out. She thinks I'm trying to be with her. \n\nI'm already not charging her rent and I honestly wouldn't be with her with a stolen dick. \n\nShe is still beautiful but I'm seeing a side of her I never saw before.", "created_utc": 1679536318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11z4tlm/aita_for_eating_out_every_day_and_not_bringing/", "score": 1109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m concerned about this\u2014 it\u2019s not good. I would try and (politely at first, but impolitely if it comes to it) get her out of there and get some distance.

Don\u2019t ask when she is moving out. -Tell- her you expect half the rent or for her to move out at the beginning of the month. Tell her that, yes, you are using food to manipulate her, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working since she hasn\u2019t bought any food to replace what she has eaten.

How lucky you are that your place of employment feeds you. She is not your responsibility. Stop feeling guilty.
