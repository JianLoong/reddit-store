I am not a \"nice guy\" and we were honestly friends. She was out of my league and I never had any thoughts about a relationship with her. \n\nWe remained friends when I went away to university and I was happy for her when she got married. \n\nI work for a tech company now. Not one of the FAANG companies but they still provide some really cool stuff for their employees. Our cafeteria is free and open 24 hours a day. We can eat all our meals there if we want. They have a nutritionist that makes sure the meals are tasty and healthy. \n\nI take advantage of the food on a fairly regular basis but I still keep food at my apartment to make myself meals I learned to make from my dad. And I keep Froot Loops which the cafeteria does not stock. \n\nFive weeks ago Madison left her husband and asked if she could stay with me while she figured stuff out.  I agreed since I have a spare room and we are friends. \n\nI thought it was a more temporary thing. She has a job and I think she has access to a joint account with her husband. I thought she would be here for a couple of weeks then go to her folks or settle her problems with her husband. Instead she has been in my house other than to work. \n\nShe ate all my food in the fridge and pantry. I went grocery shopping once so far but she ate everything again and didn't offer to pay to replace it. \n\nI asked her when she was going to be moving on but she says she doesn't know. I asked her for some money for groceries and she said she hasn't been paid. It's been five weeks. I don't think anyone holds back wages that long.  \n\nSo last week instead of going to Whole Foods I just started eating all my meals either at work or at a restaurant on the way home. \n\nShe asked me when I was going shopping but I said I was too busy with work. She offered to go shopping for \"us\" if I gave her the money. I said I was too busy to cook food at home. \n\nShe is saying that I'm an asshole for trying to use food to control her or too cheap to help her out. She thinks I'm trying to be with her. \n\nI'm already not charging her rent and I honestly wouldn't be with her with a stolen dick. \n\nShe is still beautiful but I'm seeing a side of her I never saw before.", "created_utc": 1679536318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11z4tlm/aita_for_eating_out_every_day_and_not_bringing/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop letting her.", "NTA. You have a right to keep food in your house the way you want to. She is being\u2026 ridiculous. She doesn\u2019t have money for any groceries? If I was in her position, not paying rent and staying with a friend, I\u2019d be paying for ALL the groceries and also treats as a thank you.\n\nYou are not trying to control her with food; if she can\u2019t afford food, then she needs to handle that herself.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s weird that she is saying you want to be with her so you are controlling her with food. I\u2019m concerned about this\u2014 it\u2019s not good. I would try and (politely at first, but impolitely if it comes to it) get her out of there and get some distance. This is coming across as a potentially sticky situation.\n\nHow long has this person been in your house??", "NTA\n\nShe likely thought you had a crush on her before and hoped to capitalize on that while she enjoyed the free ride she was getting from you.\n\nDoes she have a key to your place? When you manage to get her to leave, change the locks ASAP just in case.", "NTA. She most likely has the money but decided that you are a free ride for her. After all, she is beautiful and you -must- be lusting after her and thus she thinks she can string you along.

Saying you\u2019re \u201ctoo busy\u201d to shop and cook, asking when she\u2019s moving out really isn\u2019t honest. It\u2019s too soft.\n\nMadison has effectively ruined the friendship and you need to be brutally honest about that. Don\u2019t ask when she is moving out. -Tell- her you expect half the rent or for her to move out at the beginning of the month. Tell her that, yes, you are using food to manipulate her, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working since she hasn\u2019t bought any food to replace what she has eaten. And yes, you will continue to eat at work or on the way home until she moves out.\n\nToo bad about the demise of your friendship. There\u2019s nothing like living with someone to find out who they really are. Maybe that\u2019s what happened to her marriage and why her parents won\u2019t let her move back in with them.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nHowever, it\u2019s time to have a serious conversation with her that includes clear expectations (e.g. you pay for your own food/share of the groceries) and a firm move-out date. \n\n>> I\u2019m an asshole for trying to use food to control her or too cheap to help her out. She thinks I\u2019m trying to be with her.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019re being taken advantage of and she\u2019s resorted to manipulation tactics to guilt you into letting her continue to mooch off of you. That\u2019s not something friends do. \n\nDon\u2019t let her guilt trip you into being her ATM/unpaid personal chef.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly she sounds like the kind of person who's used to getting her way all the time, and doesn't think twice about taking advantage of others. \n\nIt is probably time for a serious talk about expectations. Tell her she either needs to pay her share of expenses, or she needs to find a new couch to sleep on.", "You are definitely NOT TA. Years ago, a similar thing happened to me.  I finally said I was going on a business trip and they could not stay in my apartment if I wasn't there.  Give her a deadline to move out. You are not a hotel. She is not a friend.  How lucky you are that your place of employment feeds you. She is not your responsibility. Stop feeling guilty. She is TA.", "NTA 100%\n\nNot only is she not grateful for free accomodations, instead she's being overly entitled that you should feed her for free. You need to re-evaluate your friendship with her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She is saying that I'm an asshole for trying to use food to control her or too cheap to help her out. She thinks I'm trying to be with her.\n\nHere are some comebacks.\n\n\"Hard to control you with food when you've ate all it, including my share\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm cheap but legends say there is someone living rent free and have consumed approximately $X of food for free that is still living here till this date\"", "NTA There is a user in this story, it is not you.

What kind of guest eats all their host\u2019s food and then demand money for more?", "NTA. Make your place as inhospitable as possible to get her out faster if she doesn't pack up immediately when told it's time to go. No food, hide the toilet paper, turn the TV up when she's sleeping, get nosy in her business or figure out her pet peeves and exploit them, ask her for money daily, go full petty.
