Not one of the FAANG companies but they still provide some really cool stuff for their employees. Our cafeteria is free and open 24 hours a day. We can eat all our meals there if we want. They have a nutritionist that makes sure the meals are tasty and healthy. \n\nI take advantage of the food on a fairly regular basis but I still keep food at my apartment to make myself meals I learned to make from my dad. And I keep Froot Loops which the cafeteria does not stock. \n\nFive weeks ago Madison left her husband and asked if she could stay with me while she figured stuff out.  I agreed since I have a spare room and we are friends. \n\nI thought it was a more temporary thing. She has a job and I think she has access to a joint account with her husband. I thought she would be here for a couple of weeks then go to her folks or settle her problems with her husband. Instead she has been in my house other than to work. \n\nShe ate all my food in the fridge and pantry. I went grocery shopping once so far but she ate everything again and didn't offer to pay to replace it. \n\nI asked her when she was going to be moving on but she says she doesn't know. I asked her for some money for groceries and she said she hasn't been paid. It's been five weeks. I don't think anyone holds back wages that long.  \n\nSo last week instead of going to Whole Foods I just started eating all my meals either at work or at a restaurant on the way home. \n\nShe asked me when I was going shopping but I said I was too busy with work. She offered to go shopping for \"us\" if I gave her the money. I said I was too busy to cook food at home. \n\nShe is saying that I'm an asshole for trying to use food to control her or too cheap to help her out. She thinks I'm trying to be with her. \n\nI'm already not charging her rent and I honestly wouldn't be with her with a stolen dick. \n\nShe is still beautiful but I'm seeing a side of her I never saw before.", "created_utc": 1679536318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11z4tlm/aita_for_eating_out_every_day_and_not_bringing/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m concerned about this\u2014 it\u2019s not good. I would try and (politely at first, but impolitely if it comes to it) get her out of there and get some distance.

Don\u2019t ask when she is moving out. -Tell- her you expect half the rent or for her to move out at the beginning of the month. Tell her that, yes, you are using food to manipulate her, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working since she hasn\u2019t bought any food to replace what she has eaten.

How lucky you are that your place of employment feeds you. She is not your responsibility. Stop feeling guilty.

You thought she'd stay over for a few weeks at max and now it's already been too long. \n\nShe's clearly using you and using an excuse if not being paid not to give you money. \n\nMake her leave !\n\nObviously NTA", "NTA, she's using you. Tell her how much she owes you, and charge her rent from now on. She will probably leave as fast as she can.", "Nta .... what the hell", "Nta she\u2019s used you it\u2019s time to pay rent or get out.", "She is deliberately taking advantage of you, OP. Kick her out asap, this is only going to get worse. NTA.", "Just because two people live together doesn\u2019t mean they have to share everything. If anything, the roommate overstepped boundaries by eating someone else\u2019s food without asking", "Might want to document stuff and slowly ease her out in writing. Might get into trouble soon.", "And she considers you her meal ticket.", "You are probably finding out why her husband left her (even thought she said she was the one leaving).", "I am not sure that she ever considered you a friend. I get a \"if everything else fails, I still have OP, because he is lucky to have me in his life\"-vibe from what you wrote in your post and your comments. \n\nDuring your \"friendship\" have you paid for her before???", "Dude, have some self respect. So what if you don't feel confident in your looks? You still would be worthy of her attraction (if she felt it), and you are 100% worthy of her respect. This is your house, you are the functioning adult helping someone in trouble, there is zero reason to not clearly set expectations and impose responsibilities in exchange for your generosity. \n\nIt my have seen that she was better than you based on high school superficiality, but now in the real world she should hold no special power over you.", "For some reason I\u2019m going to need and updated on this as time goes on.", "> Maybe this new side of her that you're seeing is a part of the reason why her marriage is falling apart?\n\nYeah, this is like one of those times when you\u2019re driving and someone cuts you off and you see the whole side of their car is dented af.", "He is literally."]}
