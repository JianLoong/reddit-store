It's an extreme and probably unnecessary solution (what would she do, force herself into the delivery room?), but it's also your choice. Doesn't sound like you want to have a good relationship with them anyway. Though if she physically attacked you, a pregnant woman, it's actually quite a mild way to deal with her.", "NTA. \n\nGirl, even your husband supports a restraining order against his own mother. \n\nCongrats on your babba, and good luck!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.   I can't figure out why suddenly everyone thinks giving birth is a spectator's sport.", "NTA but I don't think you know what passive aggressive means. There is nothing passive about that horrible insult your mother in law made.", "Nope, even your husband think it was right, don\u2019t feel bad, the woman legit attacked you verbally and physically", "NTA\n\nEven your husband is on your side against his own mother. That should be more than enough to emphasize how much of not an ahole you are.", "NTA.\n\n>\"I'm surprised you've came along this far, usually by this time we'd be planning a funeral for a dead corpse baby\"\n\nI'd be done with her right here.", "NTA.  But also, after those comments I would be questioning whether or not you even ever want to be on the same room with them ever again.", "NTA. This woman physically attacked you. Your husband thinks you did the right thing here, so stay strong and keep this person away from you and your family, period.", "Is it the German underground hospital ?", "You would have thought a lawyer would be more grammatically skilled.", "You must be a hella fast lawyer if you managed to already bring yur MIL to court on a criminal charge and get a restraining order in 5 days. Or a pretty lousy one if you see no difference between a restraining order and a non-molestation order.\n\nWell. NTA for getting whatever you got - probably not a restraining order though.", "So what was the criminal offense that your mother-in-law committed and was tried for that allowed you to get a restraining order in the UK? \n\nOr did you mean an injunction?

That requires some backstory.\n\nNTA though, especially if she physically attacked you and called you names.

He seems to really have your back.", "Don\u2019t let that woman in your child\u2019s life.", "Nta as a lawyer you should have a appreciation of the necessity of doing that.", "NTA, I would say your first instinct to protect yourself and your baby ahead of time in a situation when you wouldn't be able to otherwise was the correct one. You might be secondguessing now, but trust your instinct and your husband support.", "NTA he is 13 years older AND you married into a racist family. The MIL even attacked you?! I m so sorry. I hope all turns out well for you.", "The first comment you made was enough on it's on for you to tell her to get out of your house! NTA", "I\u2019d also be very concerned about MIL\u2019s racism being brought to bear on your child. She needs to know that shit will be a total dealbreaker if she expects any relationship with her grandchild. NTA.", "NTA...she seems unbalanced. Do whatever you need to do to feel safe.

Your husband and FIL had to physically pull her off of you - this endangered both you and the child.

Please act on the restraining order when,  because it's definitely a when, she tries to break it.", "NTA. She actually attacked you? This could easily have resulted in injury to you and your baby.

That woman sounds as if she's unstable.", "NTA\n\nshe attacked you. that is all the reason you need for a restraining order.", "NTA the most important thing is your comfort and safety and she is neither of those things. She physically attacked you?? Of course she was served a protection order. Consequences of her own actions, ffs. \n\nCongratulations on the new addition to your family, I hope she fucks off so you can enjoy your bonding time with your husband and new baby.", "NTA", "NTA. As someone with her own batshit insane adoptive mother, and since your husband ( who's a rockstar already for shutting his mother down) said this action IS A GOOD IDEA, do it. He knows her better than us and frankly, someone as unhinged/delusional as she is can become a dangerous creature once she realizes that you're ( you and hubs) serious. Do what you need to do to have the best birth experience you can!

Perhaps getting a restraining order was a bit extreme, but sometimes you must take extreme measures. With this MIL, I'd suggest going LC/NS (and at least she lives in a different country), and when she IS around, supervise her visits with the little one - because I have no doubt she'll take every chance she gets to make snide comments about your baby's heritage.\n\nCongratulations, and good luck on the impending arrival of you baby.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nThere's a reason your husband kept his parents on low contact to begin with.

My sister has a master's degree but when she was pregnant and would write things down, she didn't come across as \"highly educated\" when something made her emotional.  My sister also has dyslexia which some people equate with \"being stupid\".  OP could also have a disability like that.  If that is the case, then God, are you an ableist AH.\n\nYou are looking for things that will support your belief that this post was a work of fiction.

Rather confusing sentence, where she tells her parents in the beginning and then doesn\u2019t want to tell them at the end, and describes her in-laws as being across the country instead of in Canada. Still doesn\u2019t change my original opinion which was based on her not knowing the laws of the country in which she\u2019s supposed to be a lawyer.\n\nFuck off with your accusations of ableism. I have no doubt if she had a disability she would have shoehorned that in and some verbal abuse by the MIL on that topic, the same way she tacked on racism and being black right at the end. \ud83d\ude44"]}
