Regardless of money it is still an achievement to get into a good university and diminishing that achievement is an asshole move. Especially since you are trying to mend fences any way. Maybe do some self reflection and try to understand why she went no contact with you. It's not nice of her to be rude to your son but worry about your own relationship with her. Your son is a grown man and he can choose whether or not he wants a relationship with her based on her behavior. He is also too old to need you to defend him and his college opportunities.

University is *expensive* and as someone with parents who are pretty well off, I know good and well to not mock or be condescending towards others and their financial struggles and to instead be understanding and kind no matter their standing, which she should have been. She should have congratulated him for being in college to begin with and not taken it as an opportunity to boost herself. Reminding him was also super obnoxious, I\u2019m sure he knew good and well he wanted to go there if he had the funds to. In my eyes, you stood up for your son, and I see nothing wrong with that.
